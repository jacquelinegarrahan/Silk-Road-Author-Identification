				Since I just placed my first SR order, now my mind is thinking how could I be busted.<br /><br />I thought of at least at two strategies that could be used and want to ask on the forum, &quot;how come they couldn&#039;t do this to bust us?&quot;<br /><br />Is it not good to throw out ideas that could be potentially used against us?<br /><br />Or is good because it would allow weaknesses to be thought through and fortified against?<br /><br />

				They know what we&#039;re doing. They have access to all the information we have. It&#039;s just not financially feasible for an agency to seriously pursue SR, at least not yet. That may change in future.

				There also isn&#039;t kingpin amount of drugs being shipped on SR. If this was a mega wholesaling forum they would be more motivated to shut it down but almost everything is a few g at most being shipped.<br /><br />That said it is slightly disturbing SR is contracting out for a database admin publically.

				The richest dealers aren&#039;t on SR, you know how the gov works. The power of economic dominance has taken slight priority over the power to control the freedom of the people, which used to be their main pursuance, concerning the drug war.<br /><br />Why did megaupload get millions seized, but btjunkie is going strong?&nbsp; because no one working for btjunkie is making billions, would be my guess. and thr same thoughts apply here.

They would blend in so easily with everybody else. They would make purchases AND contribute on the forums. Although I&#039;m not too sure if even during a undercover op they could sell drugs as a vendor without retrieving them immediately. If not, then hiring a past vendor for the position would be the only safeguard. Still, they can do just about anything short of murder while undercover. So sketchy to hire publicly.

				Yes, with red eyes and leprous sores&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />1. Sure. It&#039;s an arms race between geeks. But we know that certain technologies are very difficult to counter. Public key cryptography is an example. Algorithms can be developed that are like scrambling eggs. Easy to achieve, and highly improbable or computationally expensive to counter.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.1. The first key thing is the diversity of networks. Let&#039;s say somehow SR is taken down. Well, then there&#039;s alternatives like BMR. Let&#039;s say TOR is taken down entirely. Well, then there&#039;s Freenet and others. Let&#039;s say Bitcoin is destroyed. The communities will simply flock to the next medium of exchange like a shoal of startled herring.<br /><br />Once the illusion that the government can track everybody and everything is dispelled, you cannot put the genie back into the box. It&#039;s now already far too late for that. To put it bluntly, there are too many people like you and me.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.2. The second key thing is &#039;price&#039;. Most things are technologically possible. In theory you can make computer software do anything you can imagine. In practice there are definite real world constraints. The government has a large checking account, but even that has definite limits. Even the genius expertise of the Stazi in East Germany and the technological sophistication of the Soviet military intelligence services using 50%+ of GDP of a superpower state could not prevent the fall of communism. Fighting markets, is an exercise in futility even for the smartest people on the planet. <br /><br />In some sense, the brainpower and computer power of LEO is not bigger than the organizational ability of the black market. It is positively diminutive in comparison. It&#039;s just not obvious that this is the case.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.3. The third key thing is that there are many here and elsewhere I&#039;ve seen who are busily at work on completely distributed systems which are far more formidable than our current incarnation of Silk Road and TOR.<br /><br />2. Sure. But even my ISP doesn&#039;t know me. In fact they think I&#039;m somebody else. Deeper and deeper into the Rabbit Hole Alice! Some buyers and sellers are naive, but a goodly number of us are real professionals using many varied methods of camouflage that we don&#039;t necessarily describe on the Silk Road forums.<br /><br />Now, for the average user, it could be a problem. Not everybody can be behind &quot;Over Nyan Thousand Proxies&quot; after all. But I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve hit a critical mass yet. General anonymity for geeks is one thing, generalized anonymity for the population is another. It&#039;s a problem, but not a serious one today.<br /><br />3. You have to have some evidence in the first place in order to setup arrest warrants. Let&#039;s say you have &#039;reasonable ground for suspicion that user X is using TOR for illegitimate purposes&#039;. Your argument was that consistently high traffic would serve as grounds for monitoring in RL or arrest right? Well, that puts everybody operating exit nodes under watch and also anybody downloading/uploading data. Using email and websites is not data intensive, you&#039;ll be sweeping up dozens of users into the net for no reason. Judges notoriously dislike having their time wasted.<br /><br />Widespread key-logging on the other hand, that could be a problem. i.e. magic lantern antics. They can only achieve such a thing with &#039;defense of the realm&#039; bullshit (patriot act), and whatever else we are, we&#039;re certainly not terrorists. Hell, you&#039;ll not find more fervent defenders of the western ideals of markets and democracy except for the Silk Road.<br /><br />4. Take a look at the TOR cloud project sometime.<br /><br />5. Probably. But let&#039;s face it, it&#039;s much easier to bust buyers than sellers. Then what do you have? Nothing. It&#039;s comparable to arresting the Johns to deter prostitution. You cannot bust large amounts of sellers. Sellers who take reasonable precautions never reveal their real world address. There is simply no reason for them to ever do so. It has to be taken on a case by case basis. It is an order of magnitude easier to bust sellers in RL. LEO loves large numbers. $XXX million in street value. over nyan thousand dealers off the streets. That kind of thing. Even if the Silk Road was the same size as the offline black market, it wouldn&#039;t attract more LEO resources in the long term.<br /><br />Let me say one thing that has probably already occurred to you. We expect to see a wave of &#039;moral panics&#039; in the future regarding the Silk Road. That will attract attention and LEO resources for sure. But over time LEO will come to recognize the points I mentioned in 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. They will ultimately STFU and focus on offline interception activities because it&#039;s in their interest to do so. <br /><br />They are servants to what economists call the principal agent problem. It is not in their self interest to draw attention to the Silk Road, and they will justify this as &#039;not wanting the word to spread&#039;, but it&#039;d be more accurate to state that they like feeling strong and not feeling weak. The illusion of invincibility is more important to LEO than actual results. That is why we recently heard of &#039;biggest multi-million dollar drug bust in 15 years&#039; when in reality when you analyzed the situation you found that 10k of drugs and 10k in cash was actually discovered. Nonetheless, they handed down a century in prison to those amateurs to make themselves look better.

				if you want to add some level of anonymity, you&#039;d only have to connect from open access points or hacked servers / vpns. but that would be only necessary for someone with a really high profile. if you are a bit paranoid, change your MAC address, go close to some mc donalds or hotel with free wifi access (always switch locations), launch TOR and you are all set.<br /><br />as to the DBA job: that&#039;s really strange. maybe it&#039;s a set up to find out who might be a gov agent?

Sure, you can setup your own TOR nodes. But I&#039;m really not sure you can specify that you have an exit node. And I&#039;d imagine with more nodes, the layers of the onion grow deeper, since that seems to make sense.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You can specifcy that you have an exit node. It is also very easy to see if you are being used for an entry node, simply compare the IP addresses sending you data to the public list of Tor node IP addresses that all clients have. If an IP sending you information isn&#039;t another public Tor relay it is either a bridge (easy to confirm by trying to use it as a bridge) a hidden service or a client. <br /><br />Adding nodes to the network to enumerate Tor client IP addresses is one of the least effective ways to go about it, since clients select three nodes that they always use to enter traffic into the network if they are up. These are called entry guards and they protect from a lot of attacks. It would be much easier to just get a warrant to passively monitor some of the directory authority nodes, where all Tor clients that do not use bridges directly connect to bootstrap a list of all public Tor nodes. After all you need to get a list of Tor node IP addresses if you want to use the Tor network. If you use a bridge it acts as a proxy between you and the directory authority nodes though. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">2.

The Tor network had over a hundred thousand users before there was even a single Tor hidden service drug forum (that I knew about anyway, although I am pretty sure I was a member of the first hidden service drug forum several years ago). <br /><br />He needs to tweak his attack a little. Instead of assuming that the most active Tor nodes are drug vendors, you need an additional bit of information. This is rough geolocation of vendors. This leaks when they send mail out via the postal network. Now you can see the Tor clients who are within say a fifty miles of where packages were roughly shipped from. There are a shit ton of Tor clients that are very active and that have absolutely nothing to do with the drug trade. There are probably very few Tor clients in any given fifty mile radius, and unfortunately vendors leak their rough geolocation when they send mail out. This is a very dangerous attack and it will be quite effective at fucking vendors,(probably) particularly if they don&#039;t use bridges.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The problem with your idea of of IDing everything in clearnet, is that 99.99% of us have *no idea* who the others on the Silk Road are.

The postmark will leak his rough geolocation at least down to city he mailed from if not more. I wonder how many people use Tor in that area? Probably not many. <br /><br />Also you are totally brainwashed to think it isn&#039;t worth it economically to the police to bust small scale drug users. They are spending free money that they steal from the tax payers, and as far as they are concerned a bust is a bust. Maybe the feds only care about larger scale traffickers usually, but you are naive if you think that local police forces will not attack SR as well. If the local police in small Texas City find a SR user in New York they will just seamlessly forward the case on to the NY police. There is actually substantial coordination between local police forces, particularly against small scale cyber criminals.

				I would actually call it a membership observability attack coupled with an intersection attack , using rough geolocation intelligence as the second parameter <br /><br />I think for some vendors, particularly those in rural areas, that it will be enough to fuck them. It is really bad for everyone though. Bridges probably help. They might not be enough. <br /><br />Using WiFi from random locations + tor and not using Tor from home is of course the best bet though<br /><br />if i were a vendor I would consider doing this.<br /><br />How many people do you think use Tor in your city? The lower the number the more you have to worry. And that is before other techniques are used to remove noise...for a simple example how many of them use Tor in patterns that fit with your observed usage patterns? Tor doesn&#039;t hide the fact you use it or how often you use it or when you use it.

				You also have to consider that going on SR or using TOR by itself isn&#039;t illegal (unless if I&#039;m wrong), so if they track you going on here it doesn&#039;t mean that you are doing it to traffic drugs, but buy and sell the legal products on here.

The attacker already knows that vendors here use Tor. They can find roughly where they are geolocated by placing orders from them. Then they can say &quot;Well, we know this vendor uses Tor and ships from this location. There are two Tor users in this area. One of them is probably the vendor&quot;.

				Thanks for the comprehensive reply kmfkewm, I frequently find useful information in them<br /><br />Some thoughts:<br /><br />1. Is there a good book on the TOR network/anonmity you&#039;d recommend? I can read wikipedia all day but I prefer a book.<br /><br />2. The idea of &#039;mail geolocation&#039; had occured to me before in combination with the ISPs knowing which IPs are using TOR, but only in a vague way.<br /><br />To surmise it seems the most anonymous route for sellers who are transacting in large volumes is:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: Be in large population density area.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B: Use a mobile broadband widget (fake ID etc for the ISP guys and prepaid card for the bills) to connect to the internet. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m uncomfortable with using hacked or open wi-fi. This is because I would want a solid reliable connection when transacting business. If you know a better way, then say so.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C: Connect to TOR via bridge. (maybe use your own personal proxy to bridge?)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D: Conduct business etc<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E: Deliver post at a different location everyday e.g. cover majority of distincts in New York city.<br /><br />What other ideas/refinements would you suggest?<br />&nbsp;<br />3.

				I should also note that since Tor is so popular it is automatically safer from this sort of attack than say I2P. I2P has like 5k users total last time I checked. They are spread through out the entire world. And it isn&#039;t that hard to get a list of all I2P nodes, a fairly weak attacker can do it. If you ship drugs and use I2P you are quite probably fucked via this attack, even if you live in a dense urban area. <br /><br />Let&#039;s say there are 100 I2P users in New York. I know this vendor ships from New York because I placed an order with them. I now know this vendor is one of 100 people. If I merely talked with the vendor, instead of getting their rough geolocation data via the mail, I would only know that they are one out of the 5000 people who use I2P. See how much damage leaking geolocation did to their anonymity? It isn&#039;t quite as bad with Tor though, because if there are 100 I2P users in new york there are probably 5,000 Tor users there (both numbers pulled out of my asshole, but to demonstrate that Tor is much more widely used than I2P). <br /><br />Then again you are still narrowed in as one of the 5k people using Tor in New York, much worse of an anonymity set size than the 100,000+ Tor users in the world that Tor thinks you are blending in with (since it doesn&#039;t know you leaked your rough geolocation). <br /><br />And if you live in Nowheresville and ship drugs from a few blocks away, you are going to stick out like a sore thumb as the only Tor user in Nowheresville. The police will probably assume you are the same Tor user sending them drug packages from Nowheresville, even if they can&#039;t trace you through the network. They can still observe you are using the network, and they know roughly where the person sending these packs lives.
