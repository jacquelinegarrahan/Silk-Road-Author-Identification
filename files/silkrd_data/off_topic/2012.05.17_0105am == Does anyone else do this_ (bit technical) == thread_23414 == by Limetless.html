				Oooh..I like that idea. Never thought of that before :D. Are you able to differentiate between the drone and the K? Every chemical has a different crystalline structure, and they all look different when crystallized, but many look similar. Basically what I&#039;m asking is, can you tell that it&#039;s two chems mixed together, rather than one, uniform crystallization?

				Well it makes perfect sense why that didn&#039;t work:<br /><br />MDMA&#039;s melting point is 147-153째 C, whereas Ketamine&#039;s melting point is 262-263째.

MDMA i&#039;ve tasted a handful of times, but I have more experience with Methylone. I prefer methylone&nbsp; :)<br />How do the two combine? It sounds like it would be a ridiculously euphoric, delightfully insane combination&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I think if you limited it to select customers then yeah, it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea at all. Maybe even sell it in pre-filled caps. I think a lot of people would be interested in it, as long as they knew 100% what they were getting. <br />The main problem I see with this though is dosing. The formed crystallization of two completely different compounds together would be extremely difficult to dose...Because it would be impossible to know the ratio of Chemical A to Chemical B in a gram of final product. Ya dig?

				The important thing i think is that the substances have a similar solubility. Otherwise they would just crystallize one after the other out of the solution. One negative point of the whole idea is that you are left with a fixed ratio of the substances. But of course if there is just one golden ratio, good for all occasions, that would be not a problem.
