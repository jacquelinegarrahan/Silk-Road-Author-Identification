				So I come home today to find a black Chevy Tahoe with tinted windows parked right in front of my apartment.&nbsp; As I&#039;m pulling in to park I look closer and notice that the license plate is Law enforcement.&nbsp; He is parked in 1 of my 2 spots in front of my place, so i park in the other right beside him.&nbsp; When I put it in park and start to get out, the the tahoe suddenly pulls out and leaves.&nbsp; So this kinda has me sketched out guys..&nbsp; I just moved in about a month ago, and i&#039;ve had 4 or 5 smooth orders (a few being qp&#039;s) to this address so idk what could be the problem, or how they could&#039;ve even caught on that quick.&nbsp; does this sound fishy or am i just being paranoid?&nbsp; <br />

				i would say you&#039;re being paranoid. if you ordered small teeny weeny amounts noone is really going to bother, im assuming. don&#039;t take my word for it. and IF it was LE i don&#039;t think they would park in your actual parking space. sounds fucked up and that shit would bother me intensely. <br />go into boyscout mode for a few days, low profile, etc just to be safe.

				i don&#039;t really consider a qp of herb a small amount..&nbsp; and they did park in my actual parking space that&#039;s 10 feet from my front door, that&#039;s what had me so worried.&nbsp; I thought they were about to present me a search warrant or some shit!&nbsp; &nbsp;i wasn&#039;t even worried until i saw the license plate, then he pulled out all quick and sketchy as soon as i was getting out of my car

				I say go with your gut bro. If you feel like you may be being watched i say take the appropriate steps to clean up shop and lay low for awhile. Better safe than sorry. <br /><br />Hope its just paranoia, but above all be smart and be safe.

				They&#039;re not exactly bright if they are parking directly in front of their target&#039;s residence. Just because you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not after you, but I&#039;m guessing he was just borrowing a parking spot. The only time it would make sense for him to intentionally park there with you as a target would be if they had someone inside installing cams/recorders and he was put there to obstruct your entry if you arrived before they had finished.

				dont just be paranoid, be actively paranoid. If you see the Tahoe again, (as long as you don&#039;t have anything illegal on you) turn up the suspicion! Make them earn their money. get out your binoculars and camera and take notes on them. If they leave, follow them. Put a brown paper bag filled with pornography under a trash can when they can clearly see you, and sneak away. Go up to random people on the street, and hand them envelopes (with political propaganda inside) shake their hands, point to the trash can, and B-line it for the closest public restroom. Then sit in there and laugh as the cops find your porn, and hassle the random dude on the street about the &quot;Vote Johnson for president&quot; BS you just gave them. <br /><br />I say fuck with them!

				He probably didn&#039;t want to park way off in the free spots and saw your 2 open ones, thought he could park there for a min, then when you pulled up went oh shit and thought you knew he was in your spot and drove off.<br /><br />At least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve done in plenty of parking lots in my time.

				There is an infinite number of reasons that the Tahoe was there. My advice check your opsec and if it needs to be improved, do so. Opsec is key

				I&#039;d say remove all drugs from your place.&nbsp; Keep it at a buddy&#039;s place for a while and wipe your computer drive.<br /><br />and get ready for surprise buttsecks.

				thanks for the advice everybody.. it probably wasn&#039;t anything to do with me, but it did have me really freaked out at first.&nbsp; My girlfriend said he waived as he was pulling out so maybe he was just using my spot and thought he needed to move since i came home.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep an eye out for sure tho and not order anything for a few days

				One day when I lived in a small midwestern town (probably a decade ago) I was actually NOT involved in any drug use because I was hard working on climbing the corporate ladder at the local hardware store (Disclaimer: that was a complete fabrication except for the small midwestern town part) I came home one day and the top floor of my apartment complex was overrun with very official looking dudes, and the parking lot had more government plated vehicles than I had ever seen. I U-turned, and beet feet and one of the cars, chased me and pulled me over. His jacket said DEA, and I&#039;m sure my eyes were wider than they heave ever been. He was looking for my upstairs neighbor who had been selling heroin for years out of his car on an interstate off ramp about an hour and a half from where we lived.&nbsp; Has nothing to do with your story, but I just felt like blathering on about something tonight!

				Are you sure it was LE? When my father hurt his back years ago, PIs would park a ways down the street and take pictures of my father.&nbsp; Very common when ANYONE is claiming workers compensation.&nbsp; these are people paid by the employer to produce evidence of people trying to scam the system.&nbsp; It could be very possible that someone down the road from you has hurt themselves (or not like 80% of the state suckers in the USA) and have an active workman&#039;s comp claim.&nbsp; And LE or private investigator, they would not park directly in front of the residence they are running surveillance on.&nbsp; <br /><br />in any case, just be smart and be careful. <br /><br />hope it turns out okay man! :)<br />trainfour20
