				some people just react to subs or done differently<br /><br />done is especially good for maintenance if you want to keep using or cant take not feeling slightly opiated<br /><br />subs are best if you are actually trying to get off the shit, for many they just feel normal but not high, and many cant use other opis while using subs cause it blocks em<br /><br />if you are on subs just get your dose down as low as possible as quick as possible.&nbsp; its a very potent opioid and you could fry the system if you maintain at 8 mg +, if you can get down below 2 mg it actually acts an agonist and you might even feel nice from it, but above that its a partial agonist that just blocks the receptor plus the half life is increased so you build it up in your system which makes getting off very difficult and you rattle much longer (like done w/d which is drawn out like crazy because of the long half life)

				its hard to say because everyone reacts differently, but i recommend you do a little reading on bup cause its a funny drug. not many others switch from agonist and increase their half-life in the same disproportional way<br /><br />the thing is some people have really bad withdrawals from subs, but one reason is because they are taking ridiculous doses and with the half-life it lasts a long time. if you reduce the dosage, the half life is reduced significantly so the withdrawal will be shorter<br /><br />some docs maintain on like 16 or even 32 mg which is crazy... if it was me i would try to cut back. since youve stabilized it should be relatively easy to get down to 4 mg a few days, then to 2 mg.&nbsp; 2 mg is around the best dose before the partial agonist properties kick in. below 2 it gets more difficult because it acts as a full agonist, so take your time and reduce down slowly, maybe to 1.5, then 1 mg... eventually to 1 mg every other day if you can. at this point some jump without issues but others need to reduce down to .5 and then even .25 mg every other day or so. the slower the taper the more painless. a few lucky people will even start to get mild enjoyable opiate effects at these doses<br /><br />another thing about getting the dose down below 2 mg is the reduce half life means one can take subs and later that day or definitely the next theyre able to take a full agonist without the blocking effect. doses around 8 mg can require 2-3 days for some people before they are able to get results from their DOC. the reduced half life means you have to dose the sub more often though too<br /><br />dont tell you doctor though, just say youre taking the 8 cause they never actually understand how the drug works (fucking morons to maintain above 8 mg) plus when you get down to a mg or 2, you can save up your extra strips for a rainy day or to sell

				Well said Micro. I&#039;ve always found the transition onto Subs to be really hard for the first 48 hours, unless you can get your Heroin use down to a lowish level before you start them. But as Micro says, there really is no need to be on anything much higher than 8mgs. And once your comfortable on 8mg (usually in the first week), you can quiet rapidly reduce to around 2mg. Because I used to rattle real bad for the first 48 hours I would just go straight to the 2mgs anyway, although I wouldn&#039;t recommend this for everyone. I can&#039;t stress enough how much easier they are to cross over to if you reduce your daily H use first.<br /><br />Subs are one drug that people really react differently too. Some like them, and others (like me) can&#039;t stand them. I grew to hate them in the end. Give me Methadone any day (and possibly everyday). It pisses me off when Russel Brand goes round saying Methadone maintenance is a waste of time. It&#039;s totally stabilized my life, I don&#039;t take H for weeks on end, go to work, good relationships etc. Everyone is different.<br /><br />Peace Willwham, good luck. :)

				Update all,<br />No methadone yet :( They will not put me on it until the benzo&#039;s I like so much are out of my system sooooo the monster habit is still consuming me, and hard. I keep getting a brick every three days, thats killing me, so now I am trying the cut in half every dose trick and not use until sick....easier said than done.....I will try to get into the clinic again Monday.<br /><br />Also, the Peopls Drug Store is RIPPING ME OFF! They never sent my order which I ordered 2 weeks ago and now say they forgot...I said I wanted refund as they offered but now they wont even talk!!!! WATCH OUT, this is your warning....PDS is going down they are ripping ppl off!!!!
