				If you don&#039;t want to read a long post. Stop here. I have always been a coke fan, but I seem to have the horrible luck of being a dealer killer. IE they always quit right after I find them. Every time. (not because of me, just bad timing) It&#039;s ok. I&#039;m over it.. I&#039;ve just taken an adderall XR, for the first time, (I&#039;ve taken IR plenty) and seriously, they give these to children? I think these should be tested on people who would be better equipped to give an informed opinion on what is going on in their head and body than a child. I seem to be having a bit of minor toungue paralysis. Should an autistic kid with speech problems already take this? I know one who is personally. That can&#039;t possibly help. I do seem task focused, but feel that I am not committing all I can to long term memory. Can that help in school? Or do people not care as long as the little bastards stay in line? Do trials include normal people, or just people with problems already? I don&#039;t know enough about the trial process, but I&#039;m starting to doubt the whole system even more than before. <br /><br />... On another note. This is quite possibly the unsexiest I have ever felt. ai suppose that would be irrelevant as prescribed.

				From what I heard, adderall type substances make people with ADD/ADHD normal, where as people without it get the generic symptoms of use. Now, that is at normal prescription doses. Usually, for those people with ADD/ADHD, the drug helps them focus to around the level of someone without it. <br /><br />As for the physical side-effects, those vary from person to person and with the dose. I&#039;m sure if someone has intense issues a doctor would prescribe something else or change something. <br /><br />You can never tell the reaction of every person with every drug, just too many variables. <br /><br />It&#039;s like MDMA killing those two in 1,000,000 people.

				I guess my question, is that for autistic people (because I know 2 that get adderall), could they accurately describe an unwanted side effect? If the person isn&#039;t normal, how can they know what isn&#039;t normal about what is supposed to be normal? As in, are the doctors/ chemical companies just going by &quot;Well, that person seems more normal&quot;? How can anyone possibly know what is going on in the kid&#039;s head and if it is anywhere close to normal or if they are just more tolerable for the rest of us?
