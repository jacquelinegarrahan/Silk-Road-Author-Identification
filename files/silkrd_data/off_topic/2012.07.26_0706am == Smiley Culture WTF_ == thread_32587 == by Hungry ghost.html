				So, I was trawling through you tube looking for songs from my childhood when I came across one I used to love: Smiley Cultures 1985 reggae UK hit &quot;Police officer&quot; about him getting pulled over but getting let off after they recognise him and want his autograph.<br />It&#039;s a cracking tune and makes my piss myself laughing. Also good is &quot;Cockney Translation&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I scrolled down looking if there were more tunes I quickly realised there were a lot of tributes! It turns out that he died last year! During a police search of his home (for cocaine dealing) he stabbed himself to death through the heart! <br />An IPCC report cleared the 4 officers of any wrongdoing; although there were &#039;flaws&#039; in the operation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, it&#039;s not impossible for someone to stab themselves, particularly someone with access to wholesale crack! But this seems extremely dodgy to me......<br />In Smileys own words: &quot; Cockney say &#039;Old Bill&#039; we say &#039;DIRTY BABYLON&#039;&quot;

				Seems fishy to me too, he was probably stabbed by someone else or LE.
