				PC Simon Harwood who has received 9 complaints over 12 years and dodged them over and over by retiring and re-entering the police force has gotten away with MURDERING the Newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson during the London Riots in 2011. <br /><br />http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9404721/Ian-Tomlinson-what-jury-didnt-know-about-Pc-Simon-Harwood.html<br /><br />This is just yet another example of how the FILTH can not only take your freedom as-and-when they see fit in the U.K but also take your life whenever they feel like it as well and GET AWAY WITH IT. Yet again the British Judicial system has FAILED it&#039;s citizens by denying justice be done and clearly perpetuating the culture of shielding their own even if they are the definition of corruption. <br /><br />Makes me sick. Fuck the U.K, I&#039;m glad I wont be here much longer.

				Outrageous story, I am (almost) shocked he managed to get away with. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m pretty sure pigs get away with this all the time but this killing was SO blatant and clear cut that I thought they would have given him a token sentence to silence the peasants. It was clear from the days CCTV footage that captured him that he was having a jolly old time beating the shit out of the general public. Fascism is alive and well.<br /><br />Interesting that the Pink Floyd guitarists son was jailed for 16 months after defacing the Cenotaph, and a student who (stupidly) threw a fire extinguisher form a building during the student protests got 32 months inside, although he hurt no one.<br /><br />Says a lot about the state.<br /><br />Frankly I&#039;m jealous you&#039;re escaping.

				What really pisses me off about this story is that the dirty, filthy, greasy, sweaty, heart-attack-giving-piece-of-bacon that murdered Ian Tomlinson is what the police would class as a &quot;Repeat Offender&quot;! The cunt has had NINE! FUCKING 9! previous complaints about his conduct over the past 12 years of his career and this dates back to the early 2000s so it actually isn&#039;t even a corrupt cop turning bad later in his career, he was fucking bent from the beginning. This prick has been abusing his power systemically since day one but that means fuck all. If you work out the averages he has been complained about ever 16 months he has been an officer and then just quits, comes back, rinses and repeats. It&#039;s a fucking disgrace. <br /><br />I am not particularly anarchistic in my ways of thinking, I actually sit just right of center when it comes to politics on most things (being the dirty, corrupt and capitalistic whore that I am) but fuck me, if anyone shot this PC Simon Harwood I&#039;d give them a medal. <br /><br />How this circus of corruption could have gone through even with the quite blatant VIDEO evidence is beyond me. <br /><br />Fuck England, this is no longer a Green and Pleasant Land.

This sort of thing brings the Justice system into contempt. I don&#039;t know what the Jury were thinking, still the man had a fair trial I suppose - presumably he won&#039;t be allowed to work as a Copper again and will retire for good?<br /><br />V.

				That&#039;s the thing though this isn&#039;t even a case of questioning what is and isn&#039;t reasonable force, it&#039;s a case of some cunt drunk on their own power abusing the people they are meant to protect. He needs beating down himself. <br /><br />Also you know for a fact he is sitting at home feeling smug-as-fuck and so deluded because all of his FILTH mates are telling him &quot;He served the force well&quot; while everyone down the local pub allows him to get his tits licked because of it.<br /><br />Needs one in the back of the head, nothing less.

				This shit pisses me off, you can see from the video that Ian Tomlinson is doing absolutely nothing wrong, albeit he&#039;s walking quite slowly and may be obstructing the police but in no way does that warrant the officer to push him down like that, all they needed to do is kindly let him know what issues he is causing them and I&#039;m sure he would of done whatever it was to remedy the situation. <br /><br />For those of you who haven&#039;t seen the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HECMVdl-9SQ<br /><br />Forward to 0:20.<br /><br />Globian
