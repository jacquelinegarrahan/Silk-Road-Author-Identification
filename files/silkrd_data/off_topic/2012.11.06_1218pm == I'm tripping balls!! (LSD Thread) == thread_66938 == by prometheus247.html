				I find it to be quite the opposite. when I am on shrooms, I am able to navigate the trip more aptly than when on LSD. Lucy always takes me where SHE wants to go (no matter what I suggest to her) I tend to be subservient to her ways, because I bought the ticket for HER show, and who am I to try to change it?

				I haven&#039;t done shrooms yet to know the difference, but with LSD for me it&#039;s always possible to operate on a level where I can type on the computer, and when I do I write pages and pages hahah ;) But it&#039;s just as easy to say now I&#039;m gonna concentrate on the trip / music and I will be so high that I have no sense of time / ego / reality as we know it ;)

				LSD has this weird effect in my vision where I think I see really awesome sparkly trails in the dark, like fairy dust or something. LOL, I feel typing would actually be easier if tripping major balls because hearing some of the whacked out things people say on LSD can be HILARIOUS, especially in retrospect.

				for me, whenever people ask me what&#039;s acid/shrooms&#039; like. I ask them &quot;do you know what&#039;s the rapture&#039;s like&quot;, they usually reply &quot;No&quot;. There&#039;s your answer. The entire fucking trip is like the rapture, you don&#039;t know what it will be like but you know that it will happen. It&#039;s extremely long in the sense of tripping, but in RL, very short. Like the atomic bomb, the bomb itself looks very huge and overwhelming but if you&#039;re there, it&#039;s over in a millisecond. An acid/shrooms trip (two very very different trips but same length type) is like from death to birth type of thing for me.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m 100% convinced that people who say the &quot;Shrooms you&#039;re in the passenger seat, acid you&#039;re driving&quot; thing have never taken a heavy dose. It&#039;s a dangerous thing to say really; the first time I tried LSD I took 500ug because I heard that tossed around and was expecting it to be underwhelming. It only took about 5 minutes into the experience until tentacles started popping out of my drawers and cupboards and the images on my computer monitor came to life and started flying around my room. <br /><br />It was fucking awesome, but that could have easily gone very badly.

I wouldn&#039;t say that 25i is a cheap knock off to LSD. they are both completely different chemicals and I can tell the difference very easily. To me 25b is more like LSD then the other nbomes. I like 25c as well and 25i is like the light beer of the nbomes to me but there are others who feel that 25i is the stronger of the nbomes.<br /><br />JOR has some of the cleanest LSD I have ever had but Albions dolphins were a bit stronger and is said so in its dosage&nbsp; and just as clean

Become one with nature... with your nature....&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br />Peace<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is the eternal dilemma for tripping, I agree being surrounded by nature makes a trip amazing. But you are losing out on music perfection from your sound system, or watching an HD video on your plasma that means a lot to you etc. But nature does make up for it. I would say when you pick nature, don&#039;t be overly fussy if you are missing some little thing because there is that element of adventure, and an adventure always has that unexpected side. And obviously pick something exciting to experience of nature, i.e. last Saturday we tripped on the mountains watching a meteor shower, another time we were at the Alpes watching the world from 3000m above, another time watching the sea from a cliff... you get my drift ;)

All I got was a mild high, I didn&#039;t notice anything until I smoked a joint out of frustration. After that I felt it a bit and kind of, nearly saw some odd things but I didn&#039;t really get that I was experiencing anything until I thought back the next day.<br /><br />So a few weeks later I took the other 3 and a half and properly tripped. That would&#039;ve been around 300m, it was fun and very strange I&#039;m eager to do it again.<br /><br />It seems to be a point of disagreement but some people think you should go with a high dose your first time 300-500m as then you&#039;re right in it and get a good experience. Some disagree but from my experience its useless being too cautious as then you don&#039;t get the effect you&#039;re after.

LSD opens the door and kicks you really hard up the arse through it
