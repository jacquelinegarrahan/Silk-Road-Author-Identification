				I am interested in becoming a vendor because it would give the site money, help them out, help the community, hopefully make me some profit etc. I would mainly be interested in offering products in the digital goods section. I guess what I&#039;m wondering is what do people on here want? Do they want high quality HD movies? TV-Shows? Porn website site rips? Cracked programs?<br /><br />If anyone could please give me any ideas on maybe some more things you want to see on the market.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />HighAllDay96

				Last time I heard they want good dope at their doorstep.<br /><br />All the shit you mentioned is on The PirateBay. As in.....Google.<br /><br />Just look around and see if there is surplus value for things you can find on the street vs what it&#039;s going for on here.<br /><br />Simple supply demand.<br /><br />If you have gear already you can post in other sections and try to gauge demand.<br /><br />But no one is really going to give you the time of day till you actually make a vendor account and start building your rep.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />

				Feel free to check out our marketplace.&nbsp; As of right now, there are no seller fees, but there will be in the future.&nbsp; Being that you do not have any previous SR reviews, you would not be able to cash out until confirmation delivery of product has been received and/or positive feedback has been given.&nbsp; Once you get enough we will set you to verified member.<br /><br />No loss in it all really, just don&#039;t fuck over our members and marketplace and you can join for free.
