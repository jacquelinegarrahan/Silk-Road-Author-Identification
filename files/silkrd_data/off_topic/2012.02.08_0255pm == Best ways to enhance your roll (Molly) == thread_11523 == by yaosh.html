				I&#039;ve been hearing all kinds of things like caffeine, vitamin C, etc. will enhance your roll.&nbsp; For the record, vitamin C has no effect other than possibly acting as protective agent.&nbsp; What I want to know is how you enhance your roll to make it more enjoyable or last longer.&nbsp; Chemically, by route of absorption, or through dietary means, not light shows, vicks inhalers, etc...<br /><br />I personally prefer 200mg anhydrous caffeine + ~100mg MDMA, 1000 mcg time released B-12 (cyanocobalamin), and I take a megadose of vitamin C (2g ascorbic acid) the day before and day of the party.&nbsp; I think the caffeine helps keep the MDMA from knocking you on your ass, B12 keeps the energy flow up, and the vit C may or may not help with possible neurotoxicity and isn&#039;t a bad thing during cold/flu season anyway.<br /><br />Let&#039;s hear it peeps!

				as I mentioned in another thread, 5-HTP (serotonin precursor) and vitamin B6 (co-factor to convert 5-HTP into serotonin) a few hours before the MDMA. Better is to start a few days before the rolling and take 5-HTP and vit B6 daily.<br /><br />A way to make the MDMA last longer is by using MAO-inhibitors, but this really dangerous and can lead to death due to the high risk of intoxication and overdose!! It depends which MAO-I is used with MDMA, because there are long lasting ones (up to 24h) and short lasting ones. There are also natural MAO-Is, which I think are a bit less dangerous. I heard that pineapple juice contains some natural MAO-I (but I&#039;m not sure about it) and I would consider it safe to try with MDMA.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />NEVER MIX MAOIs AND DRUGS!<br />MIXING MAOIs AND DRUGS MOST CERTAINLY LEADS TO DEATH!!

				Oh, and if you want to get the most out of your roll - I recommend eating healthy food before rolling and having a multivitamin.&nbsp; It really helps your body A LOT to stock up on nutrients.&nbsp; Also, take the pill / capsule rectally.&nbsp; Definitely don&#039;t snort it.

				Piracetam. Start a daily dose or two of that and your rolls will be like your first roll every time (if you properly space them out). Also eating well and exercising are two of the simplest ways to improve drug use.

I actually have piracetam around, but I&#039;ve never planned out my rolls enough to preload with piracetam, but I&#039;ve read about some people having good experiences with it.

				I noticed you make mention of OJ. I used to hear that all the time back in the day with acid.<br /><br />I know that amphetamines such as meth and the like absorb poorly in an acidic environment.&nbsp; What I don&#039;t know is if the same holds true for mdma.<br /><br />Hopefully some of our chemist folk can come by and clarify.<br /><br />As far as boosting my roll? I usually just go on an empty stomach and make sure I dose enough.&nbsp; I suppose the caffeine or maybe even the smallest bit of meth would get you moving and shaking.&nbsp; Mostly&nbsp; all I want to do when I roll is melt into a puddle for a few hours and listen to music.<br /><br />cheers!

				Grapefruit juice...or whatever reason it really does increase your roll. <br /><br />But most of all...get some good nootropics.&nbsp; I believe tryptamine has some very good pre-mixed nootropic pills specifically for MDMA.

				Dark chocolate is a natural MAO and tests show that it increases the effects of MDMA when taken for a week or so prior to MDMA use.<br /><br />Try not to overdo it though. I would probably stick to around 1oz of dark chocolate (at least 60% cocoa) a day, excluding the day of your roll. <br /><br />Also, a good diet is beneficial.<br /><br />Piracetam could possibly help, but I&#039;ve seen mixed reports.

Grapefruit does have some reactions with some heart medication but as far as REC drugs go, Hunter S Thompson was an avid lover of grapefruits as they helped shore up his immune system when on drugs. <br /><br /><br />However, I have found that taking a full dose of molly usually ends up with a TERRIBLE comedown. I much prefer to take a small dose such as 70mg with psychedelics to enhance them as that has no comedown at all. You don&#039;t get that shitty depressed feeling if you take a smaller dose with a psychedelic. 10mg 4-ACO-DMT, 20mg AMT, a hit of LSD, and 70mg MDMA is MAGICAL.

				A bit off topic, but there was some talk about MAOIs and I have a few questions on those. After using MAOIs (in my case, smoked in changa) how long would it be until your body is back to normal? And during that period what can you not take?

				I agree that 5-HTP is a no-no before rolling.&nbsp; Good for 3-5 days after to help replenish. Not something I would take as a regular supplement based on the limited info out there.<br /><br />The best things you can do are be well slept,&nbsp; eat light and healthy and make sure your set and setting are as good as can be.<br /><br />With gear as good as the best gear on SR the vitamins/minerals/juices are superfluous.<br /><br />I do think a little bit of caffeine helps if you want a late night with pure molly,&nbsp; but personally am not a fan of it.<br /><br />I think the main thing is not to dose too high initially, and don&#039;t chase the magic beyond one bump or so - it won&#039;t enhance your overall experience.
