				Does anyone else think that the london olymics has been getting way to much hype this year around or is it just me?.<br />In the last few years there have been cutbacks right across the board.<br />Police, security services MI5 and MI6, worst of all the armed forces.<br />It wouldnt take much for something to happen i reckon.<br />And, to kick a man while hes down, they admitted last week that potential terrorists were allowed into the country in the weeks leading up to the greatest show on earth.<br />Seriously, i am proud to be british but right now, our government has seemed to give patriotism a wide berth.<br />Fucking politics.&nbsp; It doesnt matter who is in charge we get fucked in this country.<br />

				To be honest mate, this government and the last have been a fucking joke.<br />When the next election comes im really trying to find a reason to vote.&nbsp; I think i might just deface the paper and draw the anarchy symbol on the bottom.<br /><br />Speaking of your kit your selling mate, do you still have that two way encrypted sat phone system?<br />If you do, or if i am even correct, i might know someone who could buy that stuff from you.<br />Hes on one of the intel boards and i could probably peddle a good price out of him.<br />If your interested anyway mate.

The Chinese have huge issues with domestic Islamic terrorism, especially in the west of the country. The difference is that in the west we put our terrorists in Guantanamo Bay or in comfy prisons here in the UK where they can continue to preach and cause issues, whereas in china the village or town causing the issues has an &quot;earthquake&quot; or devastating fire.<br /><br />In all seriousness though, the Chinese do have a huge issue with Islam because communism is totally completely anti religion and they are very good at keeping their Islam issue quiet.

				As above, China has massive problems with the religion of peace. Actual its ethnic groups and many of Chinese minority ethnic populations in certain areas are Muslim and have been for 1200 years or so in some instances.<br /><br />As for the Muslim threat to nuke the Olympics, chill out on that, the average Muslim is more interested in family and most I work with see the 7/7 bombers as &#039;fucking wankers&#039; to quote one of the guys.<br /><br />Most &#039;Muslim&#039; disputes are actually just about sovereign borders. The idea that people of the same religion may unite is a truism. Christians and Jews do this also. <br /><br />Islams main enemy is actually themselves. Then its the West who have bombed the shit out of many Muslim nations. We do not touch the Saudis though. Funny. They actually developed the current strain of Islam the Salafists who are hard core nutters who would chop off heads for trivial reasons. Note it was the Saudis head chopping that was always infamous. Now it has spread. We bombed the wrong fucking nation. <br /><br />Terrorists can easily destroy a regime but I still say Saddam, Mubrarek and Gaddaffi were way better than what we replaced them with.<br /><br />As for attacks on the Olympics, if there is not then Muslim terrorists are basically amateurs. The IRA would or could have stopped the Olympics with ease. Plus we would have warnings to clear people away.<br /><br />So if no attack then we are hyping up the capability.<br /><br />Or just lying.

				To be honest, if terrorists can&#039;t work out a way to kill a few hundred people at the olympics, then they&#039;re pretty fucking shit terrorists.<br /><br />Either that, or our intelligence agencies are WAY WAY WAY better than we think they are.<br /><br />I mean for fuck&#039;s sake how hard can it be to make a bomb? <br /><br />I&#039;m not rooting for them or anything, but I&#039;m fucking sure that if I really wanted to, and put in the time and effort, I could kill at least 50 people.
