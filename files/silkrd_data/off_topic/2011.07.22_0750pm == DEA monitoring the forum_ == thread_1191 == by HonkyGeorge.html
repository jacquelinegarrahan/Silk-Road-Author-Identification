				Yeah ofcourse, youd have all sorts of authority figures worldwide monitoring activity to some degree and there methods, who knows? Safest to assume they are around but not to worry unless your displaying regular patterns of suspicious behaivour, I wouldnt worry untill they are questioning you face to face. Im a hell paranoid anxious character usually but after some solid insight and logical reasoning from other cluey members on this board, I totally filter out most thing relative to your question now.<br /><br />Jesus iv&#039;e been on here all day and night, I really should piss of haha.

				Who knows.&nbsp; We have all kinds of different attitudes and beliefs on here, ranging from total paranoi-- they are spending tons of money just to watch *me!*--to not giving a shit.<br /><br />I tend to think that probably they aren&#039;t as there isn&#039;t that much information to be gained here.&nbsp; Shutting down SR legally would be impossibly hard, and catching the sellers also pretty hard, so they&#039;ve probably tipped off some of the western country&#039;s mail services to be on the lookout for strange packaging going to unusual addresses, but even that is hard for me to believe they would have any luck with...<br /><br />We aren&#039;t *that* big a deal, and there isn&#039;t a whole lot they can do, because of the international nature of the internet, and the TOR network speciffically.<br /><br />Anybody who&#039;s been on the wonderful site opiophile.org, knows this is a common question on there, also, and many have believed for *years* now that LE is tracking people on there, following them around, all that...yet I&#039;ve yet to hear of even *one* likely bust because of LE tracking online movements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Somewhere, reality has to come into play.&nbsp; They only have so much money and resources, and I doubt very seriously there is a room full of computer savvy LE geeks, acting like Jack Bauer&#039;s crew on &#039;24.&#039;&nbsp; More likely is occasionally some idiot will talk too much, and the cops will catch him with some product, realize he really has nobody he can rat on, so he&#039;ll get busted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like anybody, I worry at times, but I&#039;ve never been a consipiracy theorist--too much like religion, for my taste--and try to deal with the world as I find it, which depends more on plain old &#039;good luck&#039; than anything else...<br /><br />Time, of course, will tell...

				I&#039;m sure the DEA, FBI, and any other LE agency that would be concerned is watching/monitoring these forums and Silk Road. It&#039;s really not a big deal. Don&#039;t go posting your address, phone number, etc. And use a pseudonym that you don&#039;t use on regular internet.<br /><br />Shit, &quot;OpticalInfinity&quot; is a pseudonym I completely made up when I joined Silk Road, and I only use it on Tor networks. It would be pretty easy to link a person if they used the same username on regular internet.<br /><br />TL;DR: just don&#039;t be stupid.

				I heard of one horror story on opiophile where this girl just finished her 2 year sentence. (she got off easy) LE set up a site on tor, it was totally ran by them and on another, they were just trusted members. And she said the exact same thing. IT totally blew her away when she found out they were LE. She really thought that they were her friends. They spent about 6 months of doing business, etc then one day, they lowered the boom. Got a lot of people.<br /><br />The big difference with what she was doing is that she was sending and receiving cash either to her door or through WU. So, she let her guard down. Had she not let it down, she probably wouldn&#039;t have gotten busted. <br /><br />Don&#039;t ever feel comfortable or safe with ANYONE!!! Keep your guard up.

Everyone who was part of private forums called it out as a federal honey pot from the day it opened, because nobody knew the group of people who ran it and their cover story was that they came from a mixed martial arts forum that had a drug section and just so happened to decide to branch out into the dedicated drug forum scene out of the blue. They encouraged people to not use Tor, and said it was for scammers to hide themselves. Then they blocked Tor because they claimed it was being used to DDOS the server. For the forums entire lifespan it was called a federal forum. We called them Drug Zone Feds, instead of Drug Zone Forum. Their admins name was LEOnidas. <br /><br />The girl who got busted used no security at all. She gave customers her phone number. She got payment to a donation site for some relative of hers with a medical disorder, when she wasn&#039;t taking cash in the mail or western union. She was probably the least secure person to ever sell drugs online. If the DZF sting is the best the cock suckers at the FBI have, then I seriously feel a mixture of relief in knowing that they are never going to be able to bust me and a strange sense of fear in thinking of how easy it must be for seriously bad people to run circles around them.<br />

				And it really couldn&#039;t have blown her away that they were LE considering multiple people told her as much. Way to go FBI you tricked some poor dumb/naive girl into thinking you were her friends and then fucked her life. This is the reason why I will cheer when you faggots are thrown against walls and shot. The day is coming, don&#039;t have any doubt at all. Someday you will face justice for the evil that you do. And there will not be peace for you even after your failed war comes to an end, just as there was no peace for the Nazi&#039;s after world war II you will be tracked down and rightfully killed if you participated in this oppression. I suggest you read up on the Nuremberg trials so you can see just how well &quot;just doing my job&quot; works as an excuse for sociopathic fascism.

				Anyone who has been around this scene for a long time has heard these stories (damn Chr0nic, you pulled that name out of the past, huh? ;)&nbsp; ) and only a few of them, like the Leonidas one, are actually true.<br /><br />What is true almost 100% of the time is that the reason people get caught is &quot;human error&quot; (which when I do it I call it &quot;a big fucking mistake&quot;).<br /><br />If people maintain their anonymity on SR and don&#039;t get sloppy or reveal personal details, they should be fine.&nbsp; IMHO.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				Imagine you decided to sell drugs on a public drug forum.&nbsp; You spend 8 hours a day answered pm&#039;s and packing orders.&nbsp; You like to get high before you go online because it makes the busy work of answering the messages seem like more fun.&nbsp; Time flies, you&#039;re doing great!&nbsp; You ship a lot of orders, your customers like the product, feedback is all positive.&nbsp; You start to plan your retirement to Cabo and start buying your super hot model gf jewelry so she&#039;ll be amenable to moving with you to a third world country.&nbsp; You do more drugs, live virtually 24/7 in the ether, shipping all day and answering messages all night.&nbsp; You are a budding kingpin.&nbsp; Little by little though, you get sloppy.&nbsp; You stop wearing gloves when handling product or packages.&nbsp; You tell a lot of your friends who come over to party how much money you are making on the Internet.&nbsp; You sell off your excess product to &quot;friends of friends&quot; who stop by occasionally.&nbsp; You sell your BTC to people on Ebay using your real name.&nbsp; You leave fingerprints, personal information, and tracks all over the Internet and real life.<br /><br />If you do this correctly, everyone will say &quot;damn, he had good product, but what an idiot!&quot;.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get high on your own supply.&nbsp; Protect your precious life from your own destructive tendencies.

				Dess was a great vendor with a great business sense. i would call her a friend even. She was such a good person. Fuck the FBI for doing that to her. She did nothing to deserve that shit. Yeah she was sloppy but she was naive and didn&#039;t really know what she was getting herself into. We all tried to help her but at that point it was too late.<br /><br />On the note of DZF being a fed forum and blocking tor... Guess what clearnet forum is blocking tor these days? LHG. I sure hope you all are staying far away from that place...

				+1 chronicpain. Thanks for the update. Throw um off. &quot;Dave&#039;s not here, man.&quot; Lmao!! I don&#039;t live in that area either. LE just needs to go home!<br /><br />I have had a few email requests recently. I don&#039;t reply usually. Asking specific packaging questions. People not trusting BTC or having trouble getting them to SR and wanting to wire the cash. VERY suspicious to me. And I am not falling for those tricks.&nbsp; <br /><br />A thread about questionable buyers/sellers... Hmmm... Somebody should start one of those, lol.
