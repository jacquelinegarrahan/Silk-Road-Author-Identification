				I don&#039;t really see the problem, that is unless you were a grower and have the same username + uploading pictures to that site.&nbsp; Then it is pretty obvious that you wouldn&#039;t say you were a member.<br /><br />Probably only 10% of the membership grew anything that would make a LEO take another look.&nbsp; The rest was just basically a BB community.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t illegal ( obviously ) to be a member of the website.
