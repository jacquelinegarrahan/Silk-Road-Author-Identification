				By Richard &quot;Lord&quot; Buckley, Ordinary Seaman on the Good Ship Lovely Soul Detonator under the Command of Fleet Admiral Oscar Janiger, Head Detonator and Head Head.<br /><br />&nbsp;I first felt a tenseness in my groin and chest, as if something big was there. Something I knew was going to rise up to break through to something new. My whole body was jingling with alert signals: &quot;This is going to be one mother of a take-off. Hang on!&quot;<br /><br />It felt like a soul pressure. I felt strong. I felt words shooting out of me like projectiles. Acres of untapped sound were waiting to be put into the gun of expression and with the physical feelings of rising and breaking through came a great sense of expanding freedom.<br /><br />I knew I was there when I saw the high fluorescence of vivid colors. As I talked, the knots on the pine ceiling grew larger. Not abnormally large--I mean, nothing to be alarmed about, you know what I mean--but four or five times larger. I took this calmly for I understood it to be the animation of the inanimate, ya dig.<br /><br />Besides physical feelings of something big in my groin and chest and sights of pine balls growing before my eyes, I heard sounds of which triggered off new emotions. My ears were alert and pricked up like an intelligent dog. I heard a conversation on the divan--these people were interrupting me, making jokes and laughing rudely--irreverent towards the divine service being conducted in this holy cathedral. Their voices vibrated in my head like bells: &quot;Ding! Dong! Ding! Dong!&quot;<br /><br />Why, normally I would have shouted them down, stomped upon the ground and silenced them. But I felt a strange patience for their clanging interruptions. Instead of straightening them with my blasting voice, I refrained, restrained by the new insight into beauty. I couldn&#039;t strike back at them. I didn&#039;t want to. My insight into beauty included them though I was annoyed by their lack of sensitivity. Yet, I saw that the tremulous beauty and sweet serenity which I saw included the air they breathed. I felt tolerance for them. They couldn&#039;t see what I saw. I was on a multicolored balloon swaying high above the motley crowd.<br /><br />I found great extra-added pleasure in hearing old routines roll off my tongue as if a dam had broken loose--a golden river. They poured out, wrapped in the essence of love.<br /><br />I looked down on these crows cawing on the couch and thought to myself, &quot;I&#039;m not mad at anybody. I have the patience of a rose.&quot;<br /><br />Well, I knew I was at the top when I paused in my speech and looked at the light. One orange lamp came on in color with the power of a floodlight that was sired by the sun himself. White heat poured through red. Then some sweet guiding angel said, &quot;Come outside and look at the light, baby.&quot;<br /><br />I came outside and looked up through the trees. &quot;Christmas,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#039;s Christmas!&quot;<br /><br />Perfect reds, blues, greens, pinks--two absolutely white stars--purity stars. It was Christmas in Heaven. Heaven was hung with gorgeous light globes. I saw the tops of giant pines joined in union with the sky. I saw each star connected by an astral highway. Beams of light, not bold but clear, so clear--nice wispy clearness. The Dipper was connected by these same roads: the V in the diamond of the Dipper and all the stars seemed so close and friendly. I knew what they were. You knew what they were? I knew what they were: lovelights. That&#039;s right, lovelights.<br /><br />The sky in its fullness showed a shifting, revealing infinity itself. A shifting to the left revealing depths of worlds beyond, a lifting of a curtain far beyond the first curtain: farms of Christmas trees as strong as those on the first curtain shining from infinite depths. Then the curtain would shift back and those beyond were lost. Then more curtains would shift. Curtain after curtain after curtain showing further back behind beyond the far stars, deeper yet. They were fluorescent jungle lights with a depth to them and a friendliness. They had a meaning as if they were shining not lights but messages.<br /><br />One message, it came to me with great positivity: that there&#039;s only one way to live. That is, live in a house of love. That&#039;s right, the universe is a house of love. You can make every house a house of love. You can&#039;t walk out of a love house with a sword or a gun--there&#039;s none in there to come out with. You have to come with a flower. If attacked, defend yourself with a rose. There&#039;s no other way to live--the stars beamed it into me--except by love.<br /><br />I walked back to the house under my own power but with a sense that the people with me were so beautiful. I would go anywhere they led me. The star-flashed message stayed with me and buoyed up my soul as I came down from the sky.<br /><br />My conclusions: I was open to the beauty of people who had never seen beautiful before.<br /><br />You see, the next morning I went into a pancake house. I walked up and I bowed to four nuns. See, I&#039;d never spoken to nuns before. I couldn&#039;t penetrate their cloak of reverence, you dig. I walked up to them and I loved them and they were sure I owned the place, you dig, and they gave me their orders for breakfast. When the waiter came and I sat down at my table, it shook &#039;em. But I spoke to them again and I told them I saw them as sisters of beauty and they tittered and giggled and blushed and they were very well pleased.<br /><br />The love moment beat with a new tempo in me. It kept me from resting that day. It gave me further desire to perform, to salute the beauty of people.<br /><br />LSD makes love for other people and its desired expression an immediate necessity. In coming over that Sunday morning to apologize, LSD made it mandatory. Before I would have said, &quot;They are wrong! Make them wait! If they want to contact me, let them make the move!&quot; But LSD made it a driving necessity as I see them now, immediately. It was: &quot;Tell them that I love them.&quot;<br /><br />Love must be shown at every moment! LSD tells me never to save up what I need to spend in my old age--spend your love now for I may not have the chance later on, dig? My unspent love draws no interest. Like an unused muscle, it goes slack. If LSD taught me one thing it taught me the immediate necessity of exercising the love muscle. Not tomorrow but now. Since this moment is now let me just say, to whoever&#039;s pretty eyes or ears pass over these words...I love you very much.
