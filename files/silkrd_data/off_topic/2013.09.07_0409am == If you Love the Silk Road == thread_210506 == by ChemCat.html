				I remember stumbling across the road, I think I was searching to buy Diazepam online and that Gawker article came up. I was like WTF... I knew it wasn&#039;t hard to buy Diazepam online, but high quality class A&#039;s was another matter. <br /><br />Silk Road is the best thing I&#039;ve ever &#039;stumbled across&#039; I must say.

				Thanks for posting this Chemcat. Silk Road is so much more than a website to buy drugs, it&#039;s a revolution of thought. I for one have learned to accept my predilection for drug use rather than feel a nagging sense of shame when I did in the past. I have a lot of good RL friends who are big drinkers and casual coke/ pot users but I have to keep my other drug use quiet from them because they neither accept nor understand it and worry and so on so it&#039;s always been my dirty little secret. But since I found SR, I&#039;m no longer alone and am far wiser than I have been in over 20 years of illicit class A use. <br /><br />&lt;3 to you all.

				This community is more welcoming, more accepting, more friendly and more intelligent than shit loads - nay, most - of clearnet forums I&#039;ve been a part of.<br /><br />Most of the regular personalities here give terms like &#039;drug dealer&#039;, &#039;drug user&#039; and all the rest a more positive spin, and prove that much of the drug industry isn&#039;t at all what the media makes it out to be.

				Subbing to state my love as well.<br /><br />But not only for SR but also for its forums.<br />Yes surely SR is a magnificent tool to get everything you wish but my true love goes to the forums.<br /><br />In my opinion those forums are by far the best went it comes to the quality of the discussions and the forum users. I always liked to be part in different forums, but since I met the SR forums my whole life has literally changed. For sure, through these forums I learned a lot and bought some substances that helped a lot in this phase of my life, but nevertheless being active in discussions and reading some amazing post and threads had a massive effect on my general view of the world and myself.<br /><br />We learn a lot through SR forums, it has lots of amazing information about almost everything and most of all the users here are really open minded. That&#039;s one of the reasons I am in love with the forum and feel like belonging to a family.<br /><br />Everybody has few turning points in his life like traveling to a new place, college etc. One of mine is when I joined here. The is significant difference in life before and after SR!<br /><br />I will be here around as long as the forum is up and running!<br /><br />Always yours,<br /><br />Adamiz

				Hi @all Roader´s!!<br /><br />When I joined the SR-marketplace I thought I´m in heaven...<br />I used to visit it every day.<br />But a month or so later I realized that there´s a forum, too!<br />And since that I always try (when no order in transit) to reach the forums first!<br />There are always some posts that seem to be interesting, and many of them have good info, too.<br />But the most fascinating for me are the many individuals that have a way of thinking that is known to me.<br />I always feel that there is someone who thinks the same way I do, and that makes the familiar atmosphere that is!!<br /><br />Simply great!! I love this place!! If it would shut down I would miss sth in my life!!<br />...and facebook &amp; co is really no alternative!!<br />Keep on being such a people-friendly community!!<br />In contrast to the governments of the world, that has become very unfriendly to people!!<br /><br />Peace and love to all!! <br /><br />@ACE, I like your &quot;style&quot; of posting, repeatedly sth to smile!<br />@Chemcat, I like your hair, always sth to smile, too!

				Might I just say- Yes.<br /><br />That is all<br /><br />~Ali &lt;3<br /><br />(P.S.&nbsp; Love what I have gained, because it will be for life [the positives, no doubt]-- the community, the resources, the love and the purpose I&#039;ve been handed just for being one of many who think the same way about these ideals- or at least just enough to bring us all together!&nbsp; You guys are my Ohana.&nbsp; Ohana means family.&nbsp; Family means people doing drugs and sharing love [google translator])<br /><br />&lt;33333

				Not going to lie, this is my life. No, not the drugs; this, the very essence that makes Silk Road what it is, the community. I check the forums almost every day, there are so many intelligent and educated, funny, generous and just awsome people on here it makes me feel amazing, and the fact that the person you could be speaking to anyone just makes it ever better. I came here for the drugs, I stayed here and made an effort to become as much of a part of the force behind such a service and I&#039;ve loved every minute of it. I don&#039;t even go on the clearnet anymore, all I need is you guys! <br /><br />Even if I become a little bit as awesome as some of you guys, I would be happy, the road will live on forever, well past the drugs,<br />Locker.

				Very nice posts in this thread, really heart warming things to read in the past four pages.<br /><br />Someone posted &quot;I came here for one thing and I found so much more.&quot;<br />That is also what happened to me and I&#039;m very glad it did. I came here for cannabis, saw the opportunity to try MDMA after 8+ years of wanting to try it, then thought about LSD and did that also. Best thing that happened in my life for a very long time.<br /><br />Also you have to love the forums (the community) it&#039;s a great place with the right people taking about the right things. So much worth reading here, very intelligent posts from time to time. Sure there is spam and trolling and idiots but it seems to be less than in the clearnet, which is a surprise. Also I feel that the drug safety information you get here is much better than those you get in clearnet from random people because people here actually have the knowledge.

				When I first found the SR, I felt like I had encountered a parallel universe!&nbsp; For three days I combed the site, checking out all the offerings, and as I read into the richness of the forums, I was warmed to learn more about the caring people that drive this community.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I read more of DPR&#039;s posts, it was abundantly clear that he is a man who truly cares about freedom and justice.&nbsp; Unlike other dark web sites, the SR to me is a true revolutionary movement.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that it puts food on my family&#039;s table is just a fringe benefit.&nbsp; Thanks for creating and keeping such a sacred space!&nbsp; We must fight to protect this place!&nbsp;

It has become an amazing community, to share experiences, ideas, and everything in between. To having vendors wanting you to try their products, establishing contacts with O/S suppliers, and the networks that can be established, is something we all should be thankful for.<br /><br />All we have to do is open our laptops and order away. We must be very grateful to all of the SR vendors, and especially DPR who started this.<br />I&#039;m happy after living in such a dumbed down society, i can buy what I want, not what the government would prefer me to have. I don&#039;t smoke tobacco, i don&#039;t drink, but i love my mdma/mda and cocaine. <br />Alcohol related violence is getting worse, but yet the government dont do, or rather dont care about it. Yes they want us to drink and smoke, it helps curb the population, brings them money, and keeps that vicious circle forever turning.<br /><br />I am healthy and strong. I&#039;ve seen people my age who have smoked and drunk a lot of alcohol and they are starting to seize up. Its funny how being drunk is so accepted. But if your eyes are showing dinner plates, well....<br /><br />So i love the road, and it&#039;s been almost a year now since i joined. Have had conversations with some amazing vendors and forum members. We have looked out for each other, and given advice when needed. It has been an eye opening experience i must say, and i&#039;m very happy to have found this amazing silky road whilst i was traveling.
