				Lol, yea, shit got hectic. (Funny enough, thanks to some 25i).. Well, 25i, xanax, molly and adderall..POSSIBLY a bit of coke...maybe. <br /><br />Yea..Made some new friends though. :D Not that kind. No. <br /><br />So, anyways, job market blows dick. But, I do have access to a steady supply of Adderall 30mg for as cheap as it gets. Seeing as the Adderall prices on this site are fucking stupid high, I might invest in a sellers account. Maybe. Simply because 100$ for 5 pills is fucking retarded and I could sell at half that and make a killing. <br /><br />If I had a job, I&#039;d definitely do it, but as of now I&#039;m living off some cash I had stashed in case of something like this, so. :P
