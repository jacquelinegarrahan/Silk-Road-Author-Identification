				as above taxi drivers are your best bet..don&#039;t expect a amazing deal but they will sort you out most of the time..make sure you don&#039;t ask some right-wing cockney style cabbie either, make sure their from a younger generation and i hate to use the word but..&quot;hip&quot;.

				Just be careful if the cabbie has a mohawk. If he does, he&#039;s completely insane. But he&#039;s totally awesome.

				I work at a hotel in a resort village and we get asked by the guests every once in a while. We just laugh it off and tell them &quot;we don&#039;t know&quot; even though we all get high. We just can&#039;t be bothered to go buy weed for a guest and bring it to the hotel.<br />It is quite common to have the whole floor smell like weed in that hotel though.

				as a general rule I only buy hash from dealers that share the same nationality as the hash type...<br /><br />indian hash from indians,<br />pak hash from pakistanis, <br />moroccan hash from moroccans,<br />afghan hash from afghanis,<br /><br />that way I know they haven&#039;t stomped or cut their hash to shit (or if it has been, it&#039;s minimal) as they have pride in their goods unlike your average chavvy dealer in the UK...<br /><br />everyone else that sells hash up and down the country normally has the lower grade stuff OR<br />hash that&#039;s been repressed by spanish gangs multiple times over OR<br />doesn&#039;t have quantities I need<br /><br />not being racist...it&#039;s just the way it is in my decade experience of buying/selling/smoking hash...<br /><br />opposite rule for weed...hardly ever buy weed from asians or blacks though..always Caucasian..<br /><br />it&#039;s a funny &#039;ol game..

Yes. Yes, it was. Do not approach a concierge about anything on the &quot;down low&quot;. Most concierges are&nbsp; just graduated college kids with Hospitality Management who are taking this entry level job to work their way up the corporate ladder.<br /><br />Bellboys and a $5 tip the first day you check in will deliver you to the Promised Land.

				Haha, this reminds me of the movie &#039;Get Him To The Greek&#039; when Jonah Hill goes to the consierge or front desk whatever it was and says &quot; can you find this guest for me?&quot; and then he goes on and spells the guests name &quot;H-E-R-O-I-N&quot;.&nbsp; Hahah did you get the idea from the movie? :D
