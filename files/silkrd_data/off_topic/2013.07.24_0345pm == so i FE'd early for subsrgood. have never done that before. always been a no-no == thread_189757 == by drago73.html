				I just felt compelled to do so because he didn&#039;t ask for it at all. It&#039;s just that he was very communicative with me before and even after the order. My order was small, so i doubt i really did him a favor or anything. Was just showing appreciation by brealing one of my ten commandments for such a seemingly nice guy all around. I hope it gets here today. Has anybody else. Broke their no FE rule before?

Product was good, and after i finalized early while it was in transit he sent me the tracking number. I was anxiously waiting on the mailman then, cuz i had just seen him running his route on the other side of the street. Sure enough, i checked tracking and it was marked as being delivered that day. It was suppose to be a 100 mg sampler, but without a scale, i eyeballed it as being a little overweight. Great guy, will recommend.

				I would say if you are comfortable with the additional risk go for it. I would think most vendors appreciate getting a little earlier finalization since it gets them their funds sooner. Especially for vendors you&#039;ve done business with successfully previously the risk is slight. True a few vendors here and there suddenly start scamming or selectively scamming and if you FE it might mean you lose your $.

				Yeah, generally I never FE early EXCEPT for small small $ orders like &gt; 30.00 and for repeat business. never on a first buy.

				Finalizing before receiving product is the same as pre-paying. It gains you nothing, and it takes away the protection that escrow gives you. Why do it? To feel good? Safer to follow the advice printed all over these forums: NEVER FE.

				I only do it for my genuine &quot;go to guys&quot; (I fucking hate that term and how much it gets thrown around here) if bitcoins are erratic at the time. Bottom line is I won&#039;t FE for anyone I haven&#039;t done ALOT of repeated business with and that I know they&#039;re 100% solid. Other than that if a vendor is just asking for you to FE and there&#039;s no circumstances that require them to do that such as bitcoin volatility and so on then that motivates me to look up how long they&#039;ve been vending for and how many successful transactions they have. It also sends me straight to the forum to do my homework on that particular vendor. I&#039;m pretty good at smelling a scam nowadays. It only took me being scammed once for $150 to make sure it wouldn&#039;t happen again. The motherfuckers!!&nbsp; &gt;:( <br /><br />Subs is a good dude and I know that you&#039;re in good hands ordering with him. So even though you did FE you still got your shit, right?&nbsp; ??? ;) ???<br /><br />Still you never can tell if a vendor will decide to cash in on his good reputation to pull the biggest FE scam since Enter The Matrix and just fuck right off with everyone&#039;s money and start it all again under a new account.&nbsp; ::)
