				Congress is trying to sneak past a bill similar to SOPA called CISPA. I think theyre gonna keep doing this until they succeed. Is internet freedom coming to an end?

				The internet should be free, but some people do not agree. In my opinion there are much much much worse things going on in our own backyard, such as human trafficking. Again.. in our own backyard we&#039;ve fucked mother nature and shes got a virus that wont go away. We put BPA in plastics, additives to our drinking supply.. processed foods, pharma using their wealth to muscle thru congress. we are a truly fucked up country. I am ashamed to be an &#039;American&#039; (if thats what we even are anymore).

				Is the UK any better? Maybe I&#039;ll move. America seems to be a great place for 1-2% richest, and for mostly everyone else, a shithole full of lies and deciet. At one point I was so poor I had to live off value brand food.Whoever makes that shit shoulds be ashamed. They cover a shitlog in sprinkles and are like &quot;here ya go!&quot; Then you discover under the sprinkles is a smelly turd. People are not meant to live off this fake food! I personally want to start a rebellion

				&quot;Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives.<br />I think we&#039;re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends<br />and I think I&#039;m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that.<br />That&#039;s what&#039;s insane about it.&quot;<br />&nbsp;-John Lennon<br /><br />I think that about sums it up.
