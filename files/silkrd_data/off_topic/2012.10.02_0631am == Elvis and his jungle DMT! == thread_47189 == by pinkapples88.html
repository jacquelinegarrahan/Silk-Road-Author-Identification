				lol I love this shit! Its such a beautiful substance its so beautiful and kind and sweet! Its such a tease though.Its like a wannabe whore I was so close I have never tried jungle spice/jungle dmt but I was sooooo fucking close I was right at the border of the milky way and I was so close to just going right inside but I couldn&#039;t go inside! It pissed me off but it was such a beautiful trip I couldn&#039;t be mad.I traveled through some sort of tunnel made of weird shapes and colors and then to a rainbow place with square swastica-ish looking rainbows lighting up the path for me to keep going.I kept going and then right at the galaxy I just stopped and could not go any further I actually came really close to having a bad trip because I started to get pissed that I wasn&#039;t aloud to go through the giant black hole/galaxy and I was so fucking close.Why must she tease me like this&nbsp; :-[ I was so fucking close! She teased me and let me see her insides and all of the beauty and all of the delicious colors and then bam rejected! Its like the one girl that we ALL tried to fuck in middle school she will get naked and show you everything and talk dirty and show you everything you want and then when you&#039;re so close to getting it in just REJECTED like she lured me in with her charm and her beautiful shapes and color and it took soooo long to get to the milky way and then right when I was so close I know that all I need was to get inside the galaxy and then I could not go I just stopped and couldn&#039;t move I could only look at the galaxy but couldnt touch or enter! Elvis I love your &quot;jungle dmt&quot; I dont know exactly what it is but its a very curious interesting beautiful substance but she teases :( I will be back I need to pass the galaxy I want to see what is on the other side Im so excited and curious!! I feel like Im about to bust a nut! I want to go back now and see what was there! I will be back everyone! Does people know what is on the other side of this galaxy?? Can I pass the galaxy or can I not go through??? Like erectile dysfunction or something in my mind my mind was like a cock that could not cum its ready and stimulated but it cant shoot through the barrier to whatever is beyond the black hole.I will try now and I will tell you what happens when I go through.I hope she lets me through this time! Elvis I will mix your n, n dmt with your jungle dmt and I will see what happens what they combine in to.mmmmm.I will be back I need to prepare now and go on adventures&nbsp; ;D ;D

				You&#039;re supposed to talk to the Sentient Aliens who took you there, I think you&#039;re too corrupted to engage in that conversation. I&#039;m sorry for your soul :(

				Enjoyed your post. Think i want to try the jungle dmt soon.&nbsp; I got the elvis nn dmt, i&#039;m a dmt newbie.. Powerful stuff.&nbsp; I blasted off on about 30 mg and seen what i think was my life flashing super fast in front of my eyes, then the geometric pattern dmt god started showing me shapes and reality.&nbsp; Either way, i def went all the way... scared the shit out of me when i heard a sound start to get louder and Louder and LOUDER.. then BOOM... <br /><br />I need a crack pipe for my nn dmt though, foil and bowls suck, get mixed results.

				Couldn&#039;t find an official vendor thread for elvis, so i&#039;m posting here....I bought a 200mg pack of jungle DMT from him for my first DMT purchase - wicked stuff! Back then it was only $22. Lately, I&#039;ve seen $60 and $50. WTF
