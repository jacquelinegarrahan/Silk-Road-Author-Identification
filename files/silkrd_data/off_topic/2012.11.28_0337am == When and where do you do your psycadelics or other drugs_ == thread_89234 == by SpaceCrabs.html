				I can&#039;t seem to think of activities to do while high and whatever i&#039;m high on. I don&#039;t want to go outside by myself and look like a weirdo, I don&#039;t like going out with friends because i feel like a burden, and staying home is just too boring. The only thing i can think off is go along with my everyday life, but that shit don&#039;t work either with people like my parents and gf calling me all the time. I live in the city by the way, plus it&#039;s cold out. So hiking and swimming is pretty much out of the question.<br /><br />what do you guys do when tripping or w/e?

				Just being outside is great when tripping, even if it&#039;s cold! Grab a bunch of jackets and go for a walk, or even better a bike ride!

				I do my shrooms, LSD and DMT, [my favorite halutionigans], is a friends house where they are tripping to so ther are good vibes and at festivals like, Hempstock,Harvest Fest 1 and 2 and a bunch other fests. because it is a good atmosphere where everyone smokes weed, tripps on rolls on E so you don&#039;t get the bad vibe about if someone you don&#039;t want to know knows your&#039;re tripping. That can send a trip bad QUICK. Well, those are wher I love to trip on my favorite psyadelics. Peace

				I do a lot of things when I&#039;m under the influence of &quot;drugs&quot;<br /><br />Try finding something productive to do like working out or making some money.<br /><br />I like to sometimes just browse the web or try to make new friends at malls, etc.

				Tripping at home can be tons of fun, psychedelics can turn just about anything into an adventure. That said one of my more interesting trips was in a vacation club one summer. Ate 7g and spent the day lounging around the pool and hot tub area, unforgettable day.

				That is certainly a problem I do not have. :)&nbsp; Though I totally get the &quot;don&#039;t want to look like a freak&quot; when out in the public eye. The fact that it would be considered strange to sit on a park bench and stare at the sky, or the trees, or the ocean (if you&#039;re near one) makes me a little sad for humanity.<br /><br />Looking forward to boarding high this winter so long as I don&#039;t break my fool neck.

				I love being around animals when I&#039;m tripping. Especially when I&#039;m on LSD. I like to take my dog out in the woods. I don&#039;t know how my dog knows that I&#039;m tripping, but he always acts different. It&#039;s like i am on the same level as my dog mentally if that makes sense.

I think to be more precise I&#039;d say it&#039;s seen as odd to be impressed by nature. To be impressed by anything, really. It&#039;s like being in a foreign country; if you don&#039;t want to be bothered by touts or scam artists, you need to act like you&#039;ve seen it all before. Gaping in wonder outs you as a tourist. Except in this case, psychedelics outs you as a tourist to reality. And it&#039;s all pretty fricking impressive.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I almost always stay at home, I don&#039;t like to go out under the influence of anything besides meth. I like to take mushrooms and play League of Legends or Rockband 3, then when I&#039;m deep into the trip I go upstairs, curl up in my bed and just listen to what my brain has to say. Once I&#039;m pretty much done tripping I like to go drive around and listen to music or whatever and enjoy the residual happy feeling that follows a mushroom trip.
