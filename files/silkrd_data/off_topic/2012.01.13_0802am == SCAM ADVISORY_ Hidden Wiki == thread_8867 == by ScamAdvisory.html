				SCAM ADVISORY: The Hidden Wiki has a new &quot;Admin&quot; scamtroll. He is pretending to be the Admin, out on holiday, soliciting for donations. His excuse for posting as 127.0.0.1 instead of User:Admin is that he is out on holiday and blah blah blah his laptop is not with him.<br /><br />He also has a page entitled &quot;Updates&quot; that is also not locked, and to which he &quot;contributes&quot; as 127.0.0.1. Any criticism posted there or on Main_Page is undone and/or modified to his liking to hide it from public view, but you can click the History tab and start looking at the history.<br /><br />He continuously posts a banner at the top with a bitcoin address. DO NOT DONATE! It&#039;s a trap!<br />

While I can&#039;t claim to find every scam out there, I can promise that when I see something that looks certainly like a scam, I will make sure that those in Onion-land know about it.&nbsp; I&#039;m also working on gathering as exhaustive a list as possible of Silk Road phishing URLs, which I plan to post and update on the forums.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8867.msg81452#msg81452">Quote from: Horizons on January 15, 2012, 12:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Who the hell uses the Hidden Wiki for anything anyways?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Hidden Wiki is a common introduction point for newbies, so those who are new to Tor Hidden Services may not be as skeptical as seasoned users, and may fall for easy scams like this one. I aim to at least alert whoever I can anywhere I can.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this troll seems to either not sleep or uses a bot, so I can&#039;t post any notices or remove the bitcoin address without it being reverted back.&nbsp; In addition, with the true admin being hands-off or nonexistent, no official notice banner can be posted in the template to alert users of such scams.&nbsp; :(

				Thanks for the heads-up, man. I don&#039;t trust the hidden wiki anymore, myself, though. There have just been too many scams perpetrated through it. I feel like anything that can be edited by anyone on the deep web should be taken at a grain of salt. I honestly haven&#039;t been back in a long time after bookmarking the legitimate Silk Road.
