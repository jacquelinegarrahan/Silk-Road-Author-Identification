				High as fuck off the scales alone, and I still have a baggie and straw to go!<br /><br />Thank you Jeannie for a bloody good NYE ;-) Hands down the finest cola I&#039;ve had the pleasure of working with. <br /><br />Arrived at a very small house party 11.50pm with .5 of said finest, a bit of K, ghb, oc, xan to mix accordingly.<br /><br />It was one of those unexpected best-nights-ever, and what a way to ring in the new year :)<br /><br />Thank you SR!
