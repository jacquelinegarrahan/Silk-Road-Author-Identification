				Thought I&#039;d start a thread to see what everyone&#039;s plans are for tonight!<br /><br />All my friends are out drinking and I&#039;m pennyless at the moment so won&#039;t be able to join them :( so I&#039;ll probably just go for a drive and enjoy the sounds of Netsky&#039;s newly released album :)<br /><br />Would of been funner to stay in to listen to it with some ketamine but hey ho.. pay day soon!&nbsp; ;D

				Same as you Jforce.. Just reupped my bitcoin supply and waiting on the next pay slip til I can restock my liquor cabinet. Having to resort to ouzo man, and it&#039;s not even a fucking wedding or a funeral. Something is definitely wrong, ouzo should never be used at any other time than pure elation or pure despair. Anything other than that and you&#039;re playing russian roulette with the Universe. <br /><br />But tonight I&#039;ll probs just be chilling, getting hammered, and banging out a few lines of the good old C-town

				Yo Jforce mate, i know what you mean.&nbsp; Me and a friend started golf together.&nbsp; The only deal was this lucky bastard was good at everything he tried.<br />I found that just spending hours on the driving range really helps your game.<br /><br />As for the guy who said &quot;say goodbye to your life&quot; ,your right mate.&nbsp; I lost 4 years of my life to fucking EVE online.&nbsp; Then one day i went on and something happened.&nbsp; I lost all my stuff and thought &quot;all that work, for nothing&quot;.<br /><br />The great thing about Skyrim is that its not online.&nbsp; But you can still carry on playing even if you &quot;complete&quot; the game.<br />The action is just pure awesome.<br /><br />But yeah, im not going back to MMOS.&nbsp; IMO rpgs are a good way to waste time if you got nothing to do.

				But where do the drugs come into play? No man wants to fuck a Jigglypuff. He has no agenda but to disturb. This place sells many enlightening drugs and he&#039;s here for a reason. I think one good acid or mushroom trip would cause an intro-sepective awakening where he realizes he is a sick and depraved individual. Maybe even weed. No, this is the work of a lunatic. A drug-depraved lunatic. Maybe he&#039;s law enforcement or was looking for good hentai links. It&#039;s just a big question I don&#039;t have an answer to. The grammar is intentional, as he is intending to disguise his identity, yet his last post was almost normal, but with neutral undertones. I believe it is a guise, a deception. It&#039;s psychological warfare is what it is. Fascinating. <br /><br />Or I&#039;m just fucked up on benzos and Ambien again. <br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m going to bed. Arguing with Australians and talking about dead kittens and cartoon porn is my sign to go to bed.

				Hi mate.&nbsp; I bet he looked cool in the spock outfit though<br /><br />As for fringe i can kinda guess whats going to happen.&nbsp; Peter will activate the machine and gets trapped in the parallel universe?.<br />I have a feeling both machines will close the gap so no one can cross over again.<br />Probably if fringe goes south they can make a new series about peter on the other side.<br /><br />Just a guess of course!!

				According to wikipedia:<br /><br />D-IX was a cocaine-based experimental drug cocktail developed by the Nazis in 1944 for military application.[1] Nazi doctors found that equipment-laden test subjects who had taken the drug could march 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) without resting before they collapsed. Each tablet contained 5 mg of Oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of Cocaine and 3 mg of Methamphetamine (then called Pervitin).[2] The researcher who uncovered the project, Wolf Kemper, said: &quot;The aim was to use D-IX to redefine the limits of human endurance.&quot;[3] Nazi doctors were enthusiastic about the results, and planned to supply all German troops with the pills, but the war ended before D-IX could be put into mass production, though it did see limited use among a handful of Neger and Biber pilots.[2]

				Tonight is chicken tender night and I&#039;d like to start watching either Burn Notice or Breaking Bad again. Just watched the first three episodes of the new season of Weeds, man this show went downhill. Bitches don&#039;t just get shot in the head and live like that. Shenanigans.
