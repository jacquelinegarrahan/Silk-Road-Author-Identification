				as educated about drugs as many members are on here. For example, even if I started up a conversation about nootropics with most of my friends I&#039;m confident 90% would have no idea what I was talking about. Not saying I&#039;m a drug expert or anything, but I&#039;d say I know more about drugs than the average person due to my own personal research/experiences. I like reading the discussions and debates over drug use and the general public is just too accepting of so many misconceptions. Gaah.

				They are out there.. Few and far between. <br /><br />But yes, even relatively well educated folk believe some of the dumbest drug stuff. I guess they just aren&#039;t that interested.<br /><br />A classic I recall hearing: Heroin stays in your fat cells and is sometimes randomly &quot;used up&quot; when you exercise, getting you high. That was suppose to be a bad thing, holy shit sounds awesome&nbsp; 8)

I guess having grown up smoking grass and eating shrooms ...and the list goes on. I find myself not a drug user but a drug enthusiast. I&#039;m sad when i hear i lost some cool cats to their drug of choice. Once you have educated yourself you can begin to use them properly. I&#039;m not saying you cant make a mistake and the party is over. Just have to know your sources and know your body.. <br />those who don&#039;t understand the deal, will make things up....I once heard the same about LSD, that it stays in your fat and can be released at anytime even 10 years later....man i wish i can burn enough fats back to 78...that was a wild&nbsp; time. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yer, I also have heard this talk of the LSD &#039;flashbacks&#039;. We were told at school by the visiting policeman that macro grams of it remain in the base of your spine and can induce a &#039;flashback&#039; (a trip lasting minutes or seconds) at any random point years after the original trip. He went on to tell us about a policewoman who was involved in a raid of an LSD lab. She&#039;d forgot to put on her gloves and touched some of the raw LSD. She then began to trip balls. :o He said that she was later sacked by the police and had her driving license permanently revoked on health and safety grounds, because there was this risk of her having a &#039;flashback&#039; at any time!!!<br /><br />I&#039;m still waiting for my &#039;flashbacks&#039; :(

				I&#039;m right there with you guys. I at least know a couple people who have used a lot of drugs with a little education but it&#039;s a rare treat to have a decent discussion where I can get an exchange of information going involving drugs, experiences, short and long term effects and so forth.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad there&#039;s people on here with solid drug information though! I&#039;d like to see more open discussion about different drugs and how they work and people&#039;s ideas/theories on the ramifications of them--I don&#039;t see enough of that!<br />

				I remember &quot;drug education&quot; class in elementary school. This was in the late sixties, and we were bombarded by all the &quot;current wisdom&quot; of the day--the classic urban legend about the baby in the oven, the daughter of a the local celebrity who had some punch spiked with LSD and tried to fly; they told us that IV users would sometimes be so desperate to get high that they&#039;d shoot anything (peanut butter, mayo) anywhere (eyelids, feet, dick).&nbsp; But my favorite was when a visiting pig told us that the Beatles were personally responsible for the &quot;grass&quot; problem in the US--that there literally was no marijuana in the United States until the Beatles brought it over&nbsp; the pond with them...We were like 8 or 10 years old, and we knew even then how full of shit they all were...

				The war on drugs has to be funded somehow guys. What better way than misinformation? William S. Burroughs was a heroin addict most of his life and lived until late 80&#039;s (if memory serves). Heroin itself is harmless, it&#039;s the lifestyle (caused by prohibition that harms people). Not that I&#039;m suggesting we should all go out be junkies, just saying look at the fact and look at the propoganda.
