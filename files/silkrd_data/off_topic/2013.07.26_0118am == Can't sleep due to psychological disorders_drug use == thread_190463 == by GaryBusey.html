				I have bipolar 1 disorder and a host of other issues and have spent the past few days not sleeping. I&#039;m pushing almost a week of insomnia and if I&#039;m lucky have been getting an hour or two a night. What&#039;s somewhat disturbing is that the past two nights I&#039;ve taken 1 mg of clonazepam, 10mg of Ambien and 100 mg of Seroquel. I have plenty of meds I can take for it but I just end up lying in bed all night fucked up on drugs, then have to deal with the seroquel hangover once I wake up. I spent 16 hours today in bed not counting getting up to piss. If my drug cocktail doesn&#039;t knock me out tonight I&#039;m fucked and am ending up in the psych ward and they&#039;re going to keep me there for quite some time and put me on medication, drug test me, take my blood and my shoelaces and give me the exact same drugs I have here. <br /><br />I suspect they&#039;ll offer me a mg of lorazepam, a 10 mg Ambien and all the Seroquel I can eat (probably 400+mg). <br /><br />I can do that shit at home. But I think I need to see a doctor. I will wake up in the middle of the night and panic and take more of anything I can get my hands on. When I wake up I&#039;m drenched in sweat from nightmares involving prison mostly. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think anyone has ever died from insomnia, but I&#039;m not doing too good. I&#039;m a fucking vegetable. <br /><br />Anyone experiencing anything similar?

				Fuck, that sucks. Can&#039;t relate to the specific diagnosis, but severe insomnia is a bitch.<br />Ativan plus Ambien plus Seroquel didn&#039;t cut it. I feel for you man, the psych ward sucks.<br /><br />If I recall, no one can die from insomnia, because when things get most severe, your body does end up microsleeping to help keep you alive.

				Thanks for the input QSH. At least I haven&#039;t dipped into the triazolam or anything yet. I think I&#039;m a throw some temazepam in there and see what happens. If I go to the hospital and tell them the amounts of fucked up silk road drugs I take to sleep and my drug collection I&#039;m a get 51/50&#039;d and be in there for awhile. God damn I hate the psych ward. If I go I&#039;m smuggling drugs in my butt.

				I know, and what&#039;s crazy is that the cocktail I mentioned earlier (triple whammy) I WAS given in the hospital. Good luck with the Temazepam.

				I know exactly how you feel bro. Insomnia is the fucking worst. Its a never ending cycle. You are beat to death from sleep deprivation, yet there is nothing you can do to fix the problem. I wish I had some advice but the only way I get to bed is by getting drunk, which i would not recommend

				Stop the prescription drugs, increase exercise and workload, eg go out and prepare some patches in the bush, fresh air and hard yaka digging holes fencing etc. You will sleep like a baby.
