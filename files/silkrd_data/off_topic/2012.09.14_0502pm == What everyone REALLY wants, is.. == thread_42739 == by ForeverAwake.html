				<br />..to stop wanting.&nbsp; &nbsp;:) Seriously.&nbsp; Everyone, in actuality, wants to be perpetually content &amp; complete.&nbsp; Think of what that must feel like.. no worries about the past or the future. Just completely engrossed in &#039;now&#039;.. forever &#039;losing yourself&#039; in the moment.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a time when my biggest dream was just having a decent paying job.&nbsp; And, when I got it, I was extremely elated, that this &#039;want&#039; that I&#039;ve been laboring over for years, has finally been extinguished.&nbsp; For many months, my mind was at peace. My boss might treat me like shit, but I didn&#039;t care.. because I was complete. I was happy.<br /><br />Then something happened.&nbsp; As time went on, the &#039;wants&#039; slowly started creeping into my mind.. taking over my mind like weeds slowly wrapping itself around a tree,<br />&quot;I want to earn more.&quot; <br />&quot;I want to be more respected by my coworkers.&quot; <br />&quot;I want the painful memories from my past to stop&quot;<br />I want.. I want.. I want..<br /><br />I see the pattern. But sometimes I wonder if I&#039;m the only one that sees it.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />In Zen, it is said that an Enlightened one&#039;s only want, is to be &#039;awake&#039;.. forever here.<br /><br />Your thoughts?

				It doesn&#039;t matter what you have in life, you want more. I&#039;ve always thought this...<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t bother me though, not wanting anything would be boring. You&#039;d have nothing to aim for... You need some ambition to keep busy. <br /><br />One of the questions I personally cannot answer is &#039;What is the purpose of life&#039;. Being an Atheist, I believe when you die, there&#039;s nothing... If you&#039;ve been a cunt all your life, you still share the same fate as someone who has been a saint. If you were rich, you&#039;d still end up in the same place as someone who was poor. If you were fat, you&#039;d end up in the same place as someone who was skinny. When I say &#039;place&#039; I mean in complete nothingness. <br /><br />Quite a mind fuck I know... But to be honest, as humans, our natural instinct is to survive... Even Atheist&#039;s like myself can get themselves up and motivated despite believing that it could all be for nothing&nbsp; ::)

				Looks like someone needs to watch fight club or read the book just as good. With a addition to the ending that the movie doesn&#039;t have.

I&#039;ve always thought this... </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah.. it&#039;s really puzzling.&nbsp; It&#039;s sad to think that even some millionaires still continue to want.&nbsp; But it doesn&#039;t have to be this way.&nbsp; The problem is with the concept of &#039;self&#039; and the true nature of reality.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reality (the entire universe) is in constant state of motion. Even the desk that I&#039;m typing at is in motion, molecularly.&nbsp; And since everything in reality is in a constant state of motion, &#039;self&#039; cannot easily be defined.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> This doesn&#039;t bother me though, not wanting anything would be boring. You&#039;d have nothing to aim for... You need some ambition to keep busy. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand your viewpoint.&nbsp; But for me, I strive to &#039;let myself go&#039;.&nbsp; I strive to remember that I am already complete with the universe (sounds cheesy, but I can explain), and that &#039;I&#039; am really nothing in particular. I strive to let go of my ambitions.&nbsp; To &#039;lose myself&#039; in the moment.&nbsp; An example of being content &amp; &#039;losing yourself&#039; is when you&#039;re having really great sex.&nbsp; Or when you&#039;re playing an extremely addictive video game (where you completely lose track of time.)&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely not boring.&nbsp; Actually, it&#039;s the exact opposite.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">One of the questions I personally cannot answer is &#039;What is the purpose of life&#039;.

When I say &#039;place&#039; I mean in complete nothingness. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In reality, &#039;life&#039; is not definable. For example, when did you first come into existence?&nbsp; At conception? At 3 months in the womb? 6 months?&nbsp; When you first exit the womb?&nbsp; When your last limb completely exits the womb?&nbsp; Or when the sperm first touches the egg?&nbsp; Since we can&#039;t really discern when we first existed, were we really ever &#039;born&#039; in the first place?<br /><br />This isn&#039;t meant to be pessimistic.&nbsp; But instead there is clarity &amp; peacefulness from understanding &amp; seeing &#039;the big picture: the true nature of &#039;self&#039; &amp; &#039;reality&#039;.&nbsp; And from seeing the big picture, comes intense compassion for others.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Quite a mind fuck I know...

Even Atheist&#039;s like myself can get themselves up and motivated despite believing that it could all be for nothing&nbsp; ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The idea that we exist &#039;apart&#039; from the universe is the biggest source of confusion &amp; suffering for humans. Yet it is a VERY compelling illusion.&nbsp; But the truth is.. we never left the universe.&nbsp; We are the universe.&nbsp; &nbsp;So.. sollemnis, you are already complete. <br /><br />Happiness isn&#039;t something that is obtained.&nbsp; it is &#039;realized&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />(BTW: all of my statements are 100% provable.&nbsp; Test them for yourself&nbsp; &nbsp;:D )<br />
