				As most of you probably know, The prices of certain drugs don&#039;t typically fluctuate all that much. Supply &amp; demand stays constant. However, Bitcoins frequently fluctuate. This is a problem, As majority of Sellers don&#039;t adjust the price of their products, In conjunction with the static changes Bitcoins frequently undertake. Un-modified prices means the buyers are paying more than they should be for the exact same product.<br />It seems to me that multiple sellers &#039;Exploit&#039; this opportunity, Simply because they can. Try to understand it was the same abuse of control that deemed drugs illegal in the first place. I consider this site to be a revolution in moving towards the new world order, Don&#039;t succumb to this corruption, Or you&#039;ll ruin this market along with it.<br /><br />This could be resolved via dynamic prices, Updating by the minute based on the market values. This is how it works.<br />Let&#039;s say someone is selling 7g of Marijuana for a price of 10 Bitcoins, Bitcoins valued at $8 dollars a piece (All up that&#039;s $80). Then overnight, The market drastically changes rendering Bitcoins $10 a piece.<br />The sellers price remains at 10 bitcoins, When infact the price of their product did not have any logical basis for becoming more expensive. (Based on the change, You&#039;re now paying $100 for the same product)<br /><br />Yet if the pricing were to be Dyamic, The sellers price would be brought down to 8 Bitcoins for 7g of Marijuana. Bringing the price back down to $80.<br />What some people probably won&#039;t get, Is that even though the seller made less Bitcoins, The value of those Bitcoins equals the same amount of cash return. Nobody would be ripped of using this method.<br /><br />I know i don&#039;t have a high post count, I don&#039;t typically visit the forums, But i buy product regularly and have been here for quite some time.
