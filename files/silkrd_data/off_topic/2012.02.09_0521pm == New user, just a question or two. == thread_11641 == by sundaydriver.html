				Sounds like you have it down. I buy bitcoins at the bank with cash as it seems like the most anonymous way to do it, only evidence that I bought the coins is the footage from the security cameras. You can acquire an invoice and find out which bank to go to at the bitinstant website. They will also explain how you will receive the bitcoins and what kind of acccount you will have to make. Also, I have a program called ccleaner that I run before and after I use TOR. Might not do much but it makes me feel a bit better after being on this website.

				yeah that was a really unhelpful reply by me in retrospect. From what I gathered from your post you are just running Tor on your rig by itself, possibly as part of the Tor browser bundle. I can&#039;t even begin to wrap my head around the number of ways this is bad, so I&#039;ll spare you the boring details and suggest that you use a live usb solution like liberte or a fully encrypted usb drive with the browser bundle on it at a minimum (both have their own problems, but perfect is the enemy of good and all that). There are threads on how to to do this kind of stuff in the security section, this one by a member named &quot;v01d&quot; -- http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/paste/show.php?id=fcc21f55e8225274&amp;plaintext=1 -- is geared towards newbies.

Now I feel stupid.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty much doing the same thing, and I have no way to use a Linux system. I guess I just assumed I was secure if I closed down all network traffic with Tor open and used the bundle on the highest security settings, which I customized after reading some documentation. You read all sorts of opinions on the forums about what&#039;s okay and what isn&#039;t, and I thought I had done my homework. Well, time to look into this, I assume.
