				Hey guys,<br /><br />I know a girl and she´s so fucking hot. But she´s a lesbian and does not fuck men.<br />I tried everything, she´s REALLY NOT attracted to any guy (what a pity)...<br /><br />Now I want to take a drug with her, that makes her so horny, that she takes anything that comes along (in that case me)...<br />I´m a good guy, I don´t wanna rape her when she´s lying drunk on the floor... I want her to want it as well and to enjoy...<br /><br />So do you guys know a drug with that effect?... I´m thankful for any reply...<br /><br />Miguelito<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; If you knew how hot she is, you would probably go mad as well...

				I think GHB or chloroform are your best bet, if she&#039;s bent over you won&#039;t notice your fucking a corpse. If your TRULY against that, then your only shot would be MDMA, put on some Gaga (lesbos are crazy for Gaga&#039;s cooch) or Melissa Ferrick if she&#039;s more of a classy dike.<br /><br />/assholemodeoff

				Your only true option is my cock.&nbsp; It&#039;s super nice, not too long but definitely not short.&nbsp; It&#039;s very thick, think beer can., as well as clean cut.&nbsp; &nbsp;No STD&#039;s or any other disease to worry about.&nbsp; Any woman would love a ride on this meat stick!<br /><br />If you have any chance at all it will only be with my cock, no drugs needed, that&#039;s playing dirty.&nbsp; Well I guess this would be to if you just whipped it out in front of her, there&#039;s just no saying no.&nbsp; I promise!&nbsp; Now if you want to use it please send 10BTC to me and have a condom ready.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				obvious asshole is obvious. <br /><br />if the girl isn&#039;t consenting to have sex. it&#039;s then called &quot;rape&quot;. No matter how much you drug her with GHB/MDMA or some shit. it&#039;s still called rape. your penis should be cut off for even thinking about this shit. <br /><br />This is directed to the OP...

				It&#039;s rape if he spikes her drink with it or whatever. It&#039;s not rape if she consumes the substance on her own. This whole &quot;It doesn&#039;t matter if she consents if shes on drugs&quot; thing is a really dangerous way of thinking that needs to be done away with. A lot of good men go to prison because of dumb girls who get drunk and have sex with them and cry &quot;rape&quot; the next morning. And you know that shit would never fly if a man tried to pull that.<br /><br />That said, you should probably just let it go and find a straight girl

She loves to ride every cock except yours. I&#039;m not even kidding, she rode mine so hard last night it&#039;s still sore. And then she jumped off of me and straight onto Ron Paul&#039;s lap without even taking a breather. She told Ron Paul and me that you&#039;re too disgusting to fuck.

				It&#039;s highly unlikely that any drug could make a lesbian want to have sex with you.

				Lesbians ALWAYS feel disgusted with themselves for having sex with men the next morning after doing it.<br /><br />Imagine how you would feel with yourself the next morning, waking up after a drink/drug hangover and finding a large sweaty truck driver next to you in bed, knowing his spunk was all over your lips, several times. Well that&#039;s how a lesbian will wake up feeling next to you. <br /><br />My advice... find a straight girl who will like you for what you are.... yes they are hard to find, but not impossible....and trust me, worth it&nbsp; :)
