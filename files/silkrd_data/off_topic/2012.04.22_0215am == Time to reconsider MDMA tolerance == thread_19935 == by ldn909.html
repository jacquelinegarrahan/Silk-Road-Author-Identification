				Browsing through this forum I&#039;ve read several times, comments along the lines of &quot;it&#039;s not the MDMA which is crap; it&#039;s the fact you&#039;ve been caining it for fifteen years, of course it doesn&#039;t work!&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken far more MDMA than most, starting in 1997 and through the best years of the late nineties and early noughties. When the real MDMA pills started to disappear around 2004-5, I called it a day. I certainly fall in the category of heavy former MDMA user.<br />&nbsp;<br />I still occasionally take MDMA crystals and pills and have good, sometimes very good effects but for a very long time believed the myth that I would never again regain the same high that I used to love so much in the early years.<br /><br />That was until a few months ago when I happened upon a particular batch up MDMA pills. Me and my friends bought a batch and went on a bender. From the very first drop it was clear that these were something special. Everything about them was exactly the same as the Es we used to take years ago. Every single person in our extended group was just completely off it - hugging, loved up, special vision, dancing. There was no difference to the experience of years before. Just the drugs were good. Everybody felt it. It was real ecstacy, and in my opinion it was down to the quality and manufacture of the product.<br /><br />I&#039;m not suggesting that repeated use of MDMA has no effect on the body or brain, far from it. And I can only speak of my own experience. But I am cautioning against the assumption that all MDMA you take will have only a moderate effect. Don&#039;t do scammers&#039; and shoddy vendors&#039; jobs for them: realise that there truly good sources of MDMA and pills exist, and demand the same from your supplier.<br /><br />Peace.<br />

				Building tolerance of course makes a difference, but you should still get high, and the stuff should still reagent test black.<br />Also there is no such thing as 100% pure MDMA powder. There&#039;s always going to be top level suppliers putting a bit of edible filler in the ounce bags they sell to vendors here to make more money because that&#039;s just the way it is. Unless you make it yourself there&#039;s no guarantee some asshole didn&#039;t grab a handful and replace with something... so it is totally reasonable that out of every dozens of shipments some are going to be bunk.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also never seen a lab make the same batch twice. They often have shitty batches once in awhile. Some are amazing, some are shit, some are middle of the road. MDMA is always up in the air it all depends on your labs expertise and quality control, and how far down the ladder you are from the guy&#039;s manufacturing and you actually buying the stuff. Could pass through a dozen different hands before you end up with a bag 1/4 filled with sugar or salt.<br /><br />
