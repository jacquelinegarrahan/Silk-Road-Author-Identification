				I&#039;ve got to say, you kind of failed to give me a taste of my own medicine. All you really said was &quot;I don&#039;t like Blargh and I expect that if I spent an extended amount of time around him/her I feel that I would want to smack him/her.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t... try to talk down to people, though. I mean, fuck... I&#039;ll call people out on things I think are bullshit, sure. And if they fight back I might start to get a little arrogant, but hell, that just makes me human.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, I deleted my reply that you quoted because I spotted your mix-up before you corrected it and was in the middle of editing my own post with a fix, but then you quoted me and I figured it didn&#039;t matter to edit that post anymore.<br /><br />Consider who really gets hurt by counterfeit currency... mind you, I don&#039;t have a background in the financial or legal sectors, but I&#039;m pretty sure the people who get fucked over by counterfeit currency are the stores and people that accept it. Largely, this will be large-chain stores and clearly that&#039;s okay with us, since purplelotus&#039; fake-coupon collection is considered an allowed product. But it isn&#039;t just large stores. It could be small stores. Mom-and-pop type stores. Or even people, directly. And why? Because they accept the counterfeit money, unknowingly. Then they try to put it in the bank and it gets rejected.<br /><br />At least, that&#039;s my uneducated guess on roughly what happens.<br /><br />But, man, I don&#039;t give a fuck about the large stores getting fucked over. That&#039;s not why I called OP a moron. It&#039;s the little guy I don&#039;t want to see get hurt, that&#039;s all.
