				Title: <strong>Retirement Advice</strong><br />

				Okay, so I&#039;m doing some research on just how much stocks, bonds, etc I need to buy in order to retire comfortably.<br /><br />There are two steps to this, first is determining how much money I need every year to live comfortably.<br /><br />It includes all of the day-to-day expenses, including care for pets and children and a few projects of mine that I&#039;d want to continue into retirement.<br /><br />My living expenses every month is approximately 800 not including rent and bills.<br /><br />This includes food and gasoline, the two largest expenses within that 800.<br /><br />If I included bills, the electricity bill for the household is about 300 every month, and the telecom bill is about 300 as well.<br /><br />We pay approximately 50 for water, sanitation, and recycling, and let&#039;s say 50 for for the natural gas range.<br /><br />That&#039;s 700 in bills, and rent for the average studio apartment is about 800 where I live.<br /><br />So, 800 + 300 + 300 + 50 + 50 + 800 = 2300 USD.<br /><br />That&#039;s about baseline, but to give myself a bit of breathing room, let&#039;s round that up to 2500.<br /><br />So, baseline expenses every month would be about 2500 for me living on my own.<br /><br />That&#039;s 30,000 every year. I&#039;m expensive! There are many people who work full time jobs, and do not make even that much.<br /><br />However, I want to retire with enough to look after pets and roommates, so we have to multiply that by however many people I want to look after.<br /><br />I would feel comfortable with 12 people total, not including the pets, which would cost about 2 humans together. That&#039;s 14 people.<br /><br />30,000 * 14 = 420,000 USD every year.<br /><br />I need to make at least that every year to retire successfully.<br /><br />The second step is to determine how much my retirement portfolio has to be in order to provide the income I need.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to use Coca Cola Company as the standard income stock for a reference point.<br /><br />1 share of NYSE:KO is worth approximately 40 USD Each share of KO pays out a 26 cent dividend every quarter. That&#039;s 1.04 USD every year, and 8 cents every month.<br /><br />That&#039;s actually a lot. I wonder how Coca Cola manages to pay that much in dividends? Anyway, the ratio between dividend payout every month and the value of each share will indicate approximately how much I need to have invested in shares to achieve the income I require.<br /><br />Since each share is worth approximately 40 USD, and pays out 1.04 USD every year, following that ratio, to gain an income of 420k every year, I&#039;d need approximately 16.8m worth of KO shares.<br /><br />40 : 1 :: x : 420k; x = 16.8m<br /><br />That&#039;s a lot of money. But at least I know what to shoot for, then.<br /><br />So, 1.2mil for just me living individually in an apartment, and 16.8mil for living with 11 roommates and a small menagerie of pets.<br /><br />Is there any advice you guys would give me regarding retirement calculations?

				Retire?<br />We don&#039;t think so.<br />Anyone too poor to retire can&#039;t.<br />Anyone rich enough to retire is normally a workaholic and therefore also &#039;can&#039;t&#039;<br />Anyone who DOES retire statistically dies within, on average, five years of pruning roses, picking up dog poop, etc.<br />But hey, if that floats your senior boat, set sail foxy!
