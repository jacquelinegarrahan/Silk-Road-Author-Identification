				I&#039;d like to thank everyone for being a part of this great community and I&#039;ll miss some of you very much. Sorry to Limetless and ThePotDoctor, but it&#039;ll be impossible to try those beautiful samples you both were generous enough to send me. This place means a lot to me. :-[ Without giving away personal details, I can only really say suicide is the only option I have left. Rehab or prison is not something I&#039;m capable of handling, so I guess this might be goodbye. See you all on the other side.<br /><br />Gary Oak signing off.

				remember man the good things in life are free. you probably don&#039;t realise it but whatever it is you can turn it around! I guess youre going through hell right now, well keep going, dont give up. there&#039;s always light at the end of the tunnel. Speak to people IRL about your problems, that helps a lot, especially family. good luck man, peace &lt;3

				Gary I do not know what is troubling you or what has you hurting in such a bad way but coming from someone who too has had a lot of personal grief as well&nbsp; being born a manic depressant and seldom happy unless I use a substance of some kind. That is what many do not understand. As human beings we are all born wirred different and it is all chemicals in the brain. Some people are happy go lucky some sad and depressed for no reason at all. Some have energy some&nbsp; feel sluggish. <br /><br />The drugs many of us get off here to feel good or happy or have energy is just the chemicals that we were born not having that most other people do. Same as some people are born with CP or a mental illness. It is not our fault we need these chemicals in our brains to make us function and be happy and enjoy day to day life.<br /><br />As far as suicide please remember&nbsp; there is no coming back and if you do this&nbsp; if you have ones in your life you love you will just burden them with this pain for the rest of their lives. &quot;AND THIS TOO SHALL PASS&quot;<br /><br />IT IS ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN.&nbsp; I do not know your situation or finances&nbsp; but if you can find something that brings you happiness for a day and if you have done it all try new things you think you might not like. Who knows you might discover another door has been opened to your inner happiness.<br /><br />I have no idea who you are but as one human being to another I want you to be happy and I want you to stay alive and enjoy gods gifts. The evil ones who look down on us and want us in a cage will answer to god for it. Whatever god it is this or that person worships because any god must be a good god or he would not have put us all here together. My opinion anyways.<br /><br />It may mean nothing to you&nbsp; &nbsp;but I do care about you. Stay safe in all you do. Be good to everyone&nbsp; and in the end you will be the one with a smile and a happy heart.&nbsp; Karma comes to those who are bad and immoral.

				Of this person really goes through with this I hope any LEO&#039;s reading it are fucking happy and&nbsp; pat them selves on the back. Assuming this person is a good moral human being&nbsp; he has been forced to this&nbsp; for what LEO?<br /><br />Trying to pursue his own happiness and in doing so hurting no one? Breaking only laws written by corrupt politicians.<br /><br />Is one good human beings life worth it? Is one of your fellow officers lives worth it uphoading these UN-american and against the constitution laws put in place to line the pockets of the powers to be?&nbsp; IS IT?? <br /><br />I swear GOD has a place waiting in hell for some of these people who uphold and support these unjust evil laws.<br /><br />We are hurting no one and if you can not understand that or better yet&nbsp; fail to have the strength to stand up against&nbsp; what is IMMORAL and hurting good innocent people while&nbsp; you support evil cruel criminals in their endeavor to make money and not caring who they kill or hurt in doing so then you are just as evil as they are.<br /><br />If any of you LEO&#039;s go to church&nbsp; on sunday stop going cause god might forgive you if you repent in your heart but so long as you hound&nbsp; hunt and cause this type of thing and put children&#039;s mothers and fathers&nbsp; in prison and away from them then I can assure you most certainty he is looking down on you with a frown and&nbsp; are nothing more that a tool used by the evil that has brainwashed you.&nbsp; GO to LEAP and hear and see the truth.&nbsp; &quot;Law Enforcement against Prohibition&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;let your fellow dea gents and officers and judges and prosecutors tell you&nbsp; what I am telling you. <br /><br />This truly turns my stomach.&nbsp; So much I have to block it out. I have never stolen a dime from anyone or hurt anyone or had any ill will or malice towards anyone. All I like to do is get high at home play a video game play guitar&nbsp; other peaceful activities that bother or hurt no one. Yet you think I belong in a CAGE away from my family and friends.&nbsp; I pray their is a god cause justice will come one day to some of these people.&nbsp;

				Gary, please don&#039;t do anything crazy. There&#039;s help out there... Get in touch with a good lawyer and see what options you have. Suicide is NEVER the only option... fuck, i&#039;d flee to mexico or somewhere in SA before offing myself.<br /><br />Good luck, brother.

				Damn man. That sucks, but dont kill yourself. Please, its not the only option. Rehab isnt the end of the world, jail sucks, but you will be out again and life goes on. Dont end it prematurely. Theres no coming back and life is good. There are always other options before suicide. You can make it through this. You have the strength inside of you. Dont give up. <br /><br />You can make it through this. Gotta fight. Dont give up. You are here for a reason, dont sign off before you figure out what it is.

He said rehab or jail. Whats so bad about rehab? Maybe rehab is what you need Gary. Talking to other people in your situation and addressing the issues that you obviously are struggling with. How the hell is that worse than death? What happens when you pull the trigger and cross over into the next dimension, and instantly you realize that you made a horrible mistake? Theres no going back. You can get through this shit. Its not the end of the world. Theres a lot of good times to come, you just have to make it through this shitty time in your life. Fuck giving any cop or anyone for the mater the satisfaction of ending your life, because all they will say is good riddance. Fuck them. They might lock up your body, but your mind is yours and can never be contained. God speed.

				I&#039;ve been to both rehab and jail, definitely things that you can get past.&nbsp; Honestly, rehab wasn&#039;t too bad.&nbsp; I learned a LOT about myself, my fellow druggies, and walked away from the situation a better person.&nbsp; It may SOUND horrible, but it&#039;s not.&nbsp; Although I&#039;ve obviously relapsed and continue my love for mind-altering substances, but it was an experience I grew from as a human being.&nbsp;

				yes ok that makes more sense maybe, maybe driving or impressing friends just had bad luck with cops IRL not maybe raided.<br /><br />Which means possibly he had some small amounts of drugs but they were of the type which are hard, which the law purposfully makes the penalties high first to milk the lower rung of the organization who can&#039;t maybe afford the &quot;security&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second it gives them a fresh dead corpse to eat off of in cold hard Bail Money Cash which in their minds anyway makes them feel job secure.<br /><br />Third they like and most important maybe is make it so high and disproportional despite being against the U.S. constitution with &quot;CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT&quot; also making penalties in years for drugs to turn snitches as is their duty.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fourth this is also considered &quot;Torture Psychological&quot; under the Geneva War Conventions Act.&nbsp; In the USA governments own words &quot;WAR on DRUGS&quot; implies we should if not be affored our constitutional rights, but also our enemy combatant rights than forced into torture psychological to play a snitch role possibly for years or the rest of the persons life under protective custody.&nbsp; IT EXISTS NOW.&nbsp;

				I am with you delta11 we are energy and those books have been re-written time and time again by man. Those books are just a way to try to control us. Nobody but you can control what you think. You are being controlled by others if you live and think according to a book. I have read them all. I was raised in the bible belt and trust me, there are holes in them books. The bible, the Qur&quot;an, the Tora. The only one That feels right to me is The Kybalion which ask for no followers. The only part I like about the Bible is genesis 1:29. I like to throw that up to bible thumpers who want to call marijuana the demon plant.&nbsp; They are so closed minded. I refuse to embrace that because I want to be opened minded plus I don&#039;t believe in Santa clause anymore. It&#039;s great for kids though. I still enjoy reading some of the old testament and new testament but it&#039;s a fairy tale to me because in my heart I know the truth. There&#039;s been more bloodshed in the name of religion than anything else. Can&#039;t we evolve people? My mother still goes to church twice and three times a week and she teaches sunday school to the women in her age group for an hour on Sundays before the general service begins. I tell you what man, there&#039;s no trying to argue with her over it. To each their own. Whatever makes you feel right.<br /><br />http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/kybalion.htm&nbsp; this is it and there are movies also. I am no atheist because I can feel the creator among us.<br /><br />As for Gary Oak, I hope and sincerely wish that everything turns out OK for him and his even tho he hated me and caused me a lot of grief but I like to rise above shit like that when someone is hurting for real.

				Well, this has been some fucking month so far...<br /><br />I&#039;m not dead, obviously, but for a moment I really wanted to be. I don&#039;t even know where to begin, but I&#039;ll try to give a report over what&#039;s gone down in my life these last few days without blatantly revealing my identity. To start with, I went down to that forest party I mentioned about a week ago and things we&#039;re alright at first. Everyone stated drinking and having a good time, a few of us broke out our stashes we brought up with us. You know the usual stuff, weed, shrooms, a bit of RC&#039;s. Suffice to say, it was a great night. The next morning my mates and I hopped in a car on our way to the river for some fishing, already intoxicated even that early, but things changed in a heartbeat. An elk or deer or some fucking mammal raced across the road, the driver swerved to miss it, we completely flipped over and rolled to a stop. The car was literally totaled, windows smashed out, debris all over the road, it was fubar. Dazed from both the accident and the airbags, I crawled out and tried to get my bearings. Overall I was fine, scratched up and bleeding, but fine. My best mate was unconscious and pinned though and someone called 911. Police arrived, drugs were found on the scene, my mate was air evaced to the hospital while we were taken into custody. I have my medical marijuana card fortunately, and all RC&#039;s confiscated are currently legal so no trouble there. No other substances were detected in my urine so off I went. My friend&#039;s been in a coma these past few days and I&#039;ve felt fucking bloody terrible because of it. He&#039;s woken up though and is able to walk thank god.<br /><br />This horrible fucking month is still going though, as my grandfather passed away this morning in the hospice from lung cancer so I&#039;ll be offline again after this Sunday while I travel out of the country for the funeral. I&#039;ll bring my phone and laptop with me so I&#039;ll still log in, but only briefly considering I&#039;ll be busy with family matters.<br /><br /><br />I want to thank all of those who wished me well, and it really goes to show what a great community it is here. All except for you ralph, I still don&#039;t like you.<br /><br />-Gary Motherfucking Oak O0

I don&#039;t even know where to begin, but I&#039;ll try to give a report over what&#039;s gone down in my life these last few days without blatantly revealing my identity. To start with, I went down to that forest party I mentioned about a week ago and things we&#039;re alright at first. Everyone stated drinking and having a good time, a few of us broke out our stashes we brought up with us. You know the usual stuff, weed, shrooms, a bit of RC&#039;s. Suffice to say, it was a great night. The next morning my mates and I hopped in a car on our way to the river for some fishing, already intoxicated even that early, but things changed in a heartbeat. An elk or deer or some fucking mammal raced across the road, the driver swerved to miss it, we completely flipped over and rolled to a stop. The car was literally totaled, windows smashed out, debris all over the road, it was fubar. Dazed from both the accident and the airbags, I crawled out and tried to get my bearings. Overall I was fine, scratched up and bleeding, but fine. My best mate was unconscious and pinned though and someone called 911. Police arrived, drugs were found on the scene, my mate was air evaced to the hospital while we were taken into custody. I have my medical marijuana card fortunately, and all RC&#039;s confiscated are currently legal so no trouble there. No other substances were detected in my urine so off I went. My friend&#039;s been in a coma these past few days and I&#039;ve felt fucking bloody terrible because of it. He&#039;s woken up though and is able to walk thank god.<br /><br />This horrible fucking month is still going though, as my grandfather passed away this morning in the hospice from lung cancer so I&#039;ll be offline again after this Sunday while I travel out of the country for the funeral. I&#039;ll bring my phone and laptop with me so I&#039;ll still log in, but only briefly considering I&#039;ll be busy with family matters.<br /><br /><br />I want to thank all of those who wished me well, and it really goes to show what a great community it is here. All except for you ralph, I still don&#039;t like you.<br /><br />-Gary Motherfucking Oak O0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Brother, I am in tears. <br /><br />Last night, I found out that within the last 30 days I have gotten majorly fucked up around a &quot;friend&quot; (and a person who turns out to be a big blabbermouth, not necessarily a snitch but just the same problem I reckon) whom I thought I could trust, and said things that I shouldn&#039;t have about one of my friend&#039;s (VERY ILLEGAL) business. First time I ever did anything like this. Nothing has happened yet, there might be nothing end up happening, but the thought of something happening to my friend has torn me asunder, quite frankly. I feel physically ill just thinking about how big of a fuckup this is, and it&#039;s probably the biggest mistake I ever made to date. I dunno how to make it right, I dunno what to do, but I have psychologically beat myself up bad. <br /><br />The past twelve hours have felt like a bad acid trip that I cannot shake and will not wear off.<br /><br />Now I dunno what to do about my situation at all, but at the very least your post put my situation in perspective. The one thing I know I must do is learn from this mistake.<br /><br /><br /><br />BETTER PARANOIA THAN REGRET INDEED

I&#039;ve known my friend since elementary and losing him will be like losing my brother. It was one of those times where I thought if only we&#039;d done something slightly different, he wouldn&#039;t have wound up in the hospital nearly dead. He suffered an apparently rare head injury with a history of fatalities, and we feared the worst. I&#039;m just thankful he has a guardian angel watching over him.<br /><br />Going to jail or rehab wasn&#039;t even what frightened me, but rather the disappointment from my straight-edge friends and much worse from my parents. I couldn&#039;t bear to see my folks again if my mate died as a result of our intoxication. I&#039;d rather die than live to see them ashamed of me.<br /><br />To most of you, suicide is an unspeakable crime or a sign of cowardice. Well live a fucking day in my shoes. I&#039;ve lived with major depression more than half of my life. Suicide is never far from my mind, I&#039;ve attempted but somehow I&#039;m still stuck on this godforsaken cesspool called Earth. I&#039;ve had good reason to end my life. Two of my sisters have been assaulted, one of my brothers has nearly died more times than I have and even survived having his back broken, not to mention I inherited my depression so I&#039;ve had to watch my own mother deal with it since birth. How do you think it feels going through so many birthdays and even my own graduation while my mum stays in bed sobbing. I&#039;ve felt as though I&#039;ve been a burden my entire life. I barely even graduated thanks to my fucking ADHD because my attention span is fucked from genetics. My shitty genetics doesn&#039;t stop there though, oh not at all. I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve been bullied because I was the only kid with Marfan syndrome in school, or because I&#039;m a male with an eating disorder. Not being specific, but I&#039;m well over 6 foot yet I only weigh 116lbs. Yeah, try fucking living with that. My own metabolism hates me, go figure. They wanted to feed me through a tube when I was younger, what god damn kid wants to be told he&#039;s going to be fed through a tube?! Even worse is having all of these problems, and having a grandma telling you to just &#039;snap out of it&#039;. &quot;Oh, he&#039;s depressed? Tell him to snap out of it!&quot; &quot;Oh, he won&#039;t eat? Tell him to snap out of it!&quot; Well you can&#039;t just fucking snap out of it! God damn it! &gt;:(<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t give a shit if you&#039;re suspicious or not, because you should be. You&#039;re better off that way, you can&#039;t trust anyone in the world and that&#039;s the way it&#039;s always been. <br /><br />As for you poonjabber, you&#039;re just an anonymous piece of shit that doesn&#039;t even matter. You could disappear off the face of the earth and not a single fuck would be given that day. No one would even show up to your funeral other than me just to piss on your grave. Not even Jeffrey Dahmer would want you, you worthless piece of shit.

				Good to hear your still with us. Keep your head up high man. All of the problems you face in life make you who you are. You are a person with a soul and a reason to be. Keep on keepin on. From your last couple of posts here its sounds to me that you are still pretty young. I would guess between 19 and 22 years old. Life is long dude. You got a lot of road to travel still. All these struggles and hard times will make you a stronger and wiser person if you stick it out.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about your struggles, but know that you always have other options besides ending your life, and there are a lot of people out there who know what you are going through and want to help you. Shit, even on Silkroad which is a fraction of a percent of the population, people are looking out for you. And for the haterz wishing bad on you or anyone else, they are just ignorant morons who will get what they deserve in the end.<br /><br />Safe journeys.<br /><br />

Its a real problem in our society and probably a leading cause of a lot of the suicides that take place daily that when you show emotion, or ask for help you&#039;re considered a bitch by the majority of your peers. I think it takes balls to ask for help and to do what you have to do to pick yourself back up and keep moving forward. When you hit rock bottom and are actually considering ending your life, you dont give a fuck what anyone else thinks about you or your decisions anyway, so anyones disrespect or negativity will be falling on deaf ears. But also know that there are people out there that actually know where your coming from because they&#039;ve been there too, and dont want you to do anything that you cant take back. For all the people whos lives have been peachy keen and sunshine and lollipops, good for you, but try to keep your negative comments to yourself, because if you&#039;ve never felt like ending your life, you have no idea how dark this world can be. And try to be a decent person and remember that a person who has all that weight on his shoulders doesnt need anymore bullshit to deal with. Welcome back Gary.<br /><br />
