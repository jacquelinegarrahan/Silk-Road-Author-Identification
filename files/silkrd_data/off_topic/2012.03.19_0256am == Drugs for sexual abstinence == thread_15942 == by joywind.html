				What drugs can I use to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the desire to have sex?&nbsp; I am thinking about women too often. It is depressing me and distracting me from more important matters.

				In all seriousness, anti-depressants always kill my sex-drive. Literally, I could have sex for hours and would end up with horrible blue balls and no orgasm.

				I also lost my sex drive on certain anti-depressants. The most notable one was Sertraline/Zoloft - completely took out my sex drive and ability to orgasm. I ended up stopping it for that reason (what can I say, I like sex!).<br /><br />You could also try therapy? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It just seems like so much work to meet someone, date a half dozen times then maybe have sex.

				too much of anything. a little bit of MDMA, E, Coke, H, pot, booze all make me want to fuck anything that moves, but do a bit more and that appetite disappears. or maybe it&#039;s just me

It worsened my anxiety, depression, OCD and basically fucked me up. I&#039;m not even sure if it did anything positive for me at all.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Eventually I just felt like seeing if overdosing on it would kill me as it made me horribly depressed. Well, I took around 4,000mg all at once and it obviously didn&#039;t kill me (duh!) but did give me the worst month of my life. I never went to the hospital like I should have, so I spent a week straight puking/shitting my guts out to the point where I just gave up eating. I literally slept in the bathroom that week.<br /><br />Moral of the story is. . .sex isn&#039;t as depressing as sitting on a toilet for a week straight. :o

				I agree with Prozac, it kills your need for sex.&nbsp; I used to constantly think/want/need sex (or at least masturbation) to live but taking one of them every other day has helped significantly.
