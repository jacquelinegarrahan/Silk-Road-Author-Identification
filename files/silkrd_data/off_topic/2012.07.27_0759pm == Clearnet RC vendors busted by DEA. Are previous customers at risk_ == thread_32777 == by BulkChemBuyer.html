				I got an email from SimFluxResources today saying that he was busted by 30 federal agents who seized everything. I&#039;m sure that some other clearnet vendors were busted as well.<br /><br />Are they going to come after their customers?

But recently they have gained fame as a go-to recreational drug of choice for adventurous substance abusers lacking access to traditional hard drugs. When uppers such as meth and cocaine are unavailable or too expensive, bath salts make for a more accessible and cheaper alternative. Of course, ingesting bath salts can make you batshit insane, but hey, just look at this crazy world and tell me the benefit of sanity!<br /><br />Speaking of inhaling the stuff you find under you sink, you should never do it. Otherwise, you could end up like this girl:<br /><br />You may recall that bath salts were originally implicated in the infamous Miami homeless zombie apocalypse face-eating incident in May. Subsequently, however, it was determined that bath salts were not to blame. Instead, it was just another day in Florida—the weirdest state in union.<br /><br />But don’t be fooled: bath salts are potent—so potent that you don’t even have to take them to be driven mad by them. Witness the case of Daniel Avery, who, after his son overdosed on bath salts, destroyed the store that sold his son the stuff.<br /><br />I’m sure that after today’s raids and recent legislation passed cracking down on bath salts, they will disappear forever and be inaccessible to everyone, just like all the other drugs that are currently banned. The great thing about the war on drugs is that it’s been so wildly successful, no one anywhere can buy illegal drugs! And that’s a good thing, because remember, folks, drugs are bad:<br /><br />Unless of course, the drugs are being pushed on you by the pharmaceutical industry, whose products kill 300% more Americans than illegal drugs. But there’s a clear difference between the bath salt and the pharmaceutical industry: campaign donations.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In a massive nationwide crackdown on synthetic pot, the feds arrested 90 people and confiscated a mountain of dangerous designer drugs.<br /><br />They also seized $36 million in cash from dozens of manufacturers and sellers who flouted a ban enacted several weeks ago, authorities said Thursday.<br /><br />“Operation Logjam” came four months after a Daily News investigation highlighted the danger and availability of fake weed.<br /><br />Agents fanning out from Texas to Brooklyn seized almost 5 million packets of synthetic pot and 167,000 envelopes of bath salts.<br /><br />The Drug Enforcement Administration’s &#039;Operation Logjam&#039; comes weeks after Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., pushed through a nationwide ban of the dangerous drugs.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;“We will come after you,” said James Chaparro of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.<br /><br />Those arrested include four men who allegedly ran an Internet operation out of Tampa and Bayshore, L.I., selling packets labeled Black Mamba and Mr. Spicy Green.<br /><br />Three men who manufactured and sold huge quantities of mind-bending bath salts in Newark were also busted, federal prosecutors said.<br /><br />Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who pushed through a federal ban of the substances, said the raids were a wakeup call for those selling the mind-benders.<br /><br />“If local retailers and manufacturers think that they can still get away with business as usual and continue to sell and produce these synthetic poisons, then yesterday’s DEA raids should be a lesson to them,” he said.<br /><br />As The News reported, synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the main ingredient in real pot have been linked to several deaths and thousands of health scares.<br /><br />The chemically treated herbs — known as K2, Spice, potpourri or incense — can cause hallucinations, seizures and violent behavior. Bath salts have been tied to gruesome crimes.<br /><br />Karen Dobner, whose 19-year-old son, Max, was killed in a car crash after smoking fake weed, said the raids were welcome news.<br /><br />“I know Max is smiling down on us,” said the Illinois mom, who started a foundation to educate the public about the dangers of the drugs.<br /><br />“This is a very happy day for us.”<br /><br />Not so for Richard Broider, president of the North American Herbal Incense Trade Association, which claims to have 1,200 members and says the product should stay legal.<br /><br />“It was a sad day for freedom,” he told The News.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Yeah I heard about Operation Log Jam. Why were RC suppliers involved in this though? The stuff they sell is completely legal. It&#039;s my understanding that they busted the people who didn&#039;t hear about or didn&#039;t care about the ban two weeks ago, and were selling things that were illegal. Everything SFR sold was 100%. What could they bust him for?<br /><br />Does anyone think they&#039;ll be coming after his previous customers or no?

				The UK has harsher laws now with RCs. The laws are a kind of catch-all and any new RC identified can be banned.<br /><br />As for synth cannabanoids th following applies. UK (law)<br /><br />From 23 December 2009, synthetic cannabinoids were classified alongside cannabis as a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. <br /><br />A buddy who part owned a head shop keeps up with all the laws. Cops and local council official even got them to stop selling female seeds as they were specifically being used to germinate.<br /><br />And the normal seeds at up to £10 a seed are &#039;ok&#039;&#039;. He complied, simply sent the female seeds back for swaps as head shops obviously have a business relationship with their suppliers, usually the seedbank itself.<br /><br />The truth is, some of these RCs are maybe not the best idea in the world to sell to people. The &#039;bath salt&#039; situation we had in the UK for years till the ban. The loophole was that you could put perhaps 250mg of mephedrone mixed in with some benign filler. Import a kilo of mephedrone for £2000 (in the day, for a kilo from China) and mix with 4 KG of whatever. Printers are struggling and its easy to get some glossy bags made up. Say, 5p a packet but that would be top quality and inner wrapping also - silver foil and plastic. snazzy design. For £2000 you now got packets of bath salts selling for £10 in the more honest head shops. that is a massive profit!!!!<br /><br />With the cannabanoids, guys got a kilo - then bought up any old herb, cheap as shit. The mix was often very sloppy which meant some bags were very potent and others less so. This aint glaxo smith its guys with a profit motive.<br /><br />I fear RCs are now just in the hands of the majority of dealers who are not very nice people. OK, your local coke dealer might be all smiles when you buy, smiling when you maybe run up a tab but in the UK, owing money or even arguing over quality is dangerous!<br /><br />That is why I choose SR because the RC vendors, the established ones and new honest ones, take great care measuring doses and they use it so obviously make sure that they make a safe product and at a good price. They make a good profit but if caught face jail so moaning at high prices is a no brainer. We buy because its easier for many and safer!!<br /><br />Buying off the clearnet is silly. I done it ten years or more ago when many Dutch sites operated pretty much like SR, with images of the produce and deals aplenty as competition made things good for the customers. Many of those sites were quietly busted, it was not news back then and few journalists seemed to bother doing the &#039;horror of drugs exposed&#039; story.<br /><br />You got to stay on top of the lists of RCs banned in your nation. <br /><br />USA is worse than the UK re drugs. In the UK you need to have a LOT of shit to serve any kind of worrying amount of time. In the USA its worse. <br /><br />Be safe out there.<br /><br />Remember anyone caught selling drugs WILL be offered deals such as fingering resellers which many buyers of RC&#039;s om the clearnet do!<br /><br />Prior to the UK ban I think some went for the mother-load off the Chinese suppliers.
