				I think there are 2 main types of people that order from SR.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; The person that orders for themselves, not large amounts and nothing more.&nbsp; <br /><br />2.&nbsp; The person that orders in bulk trying to turn a profit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, with that let me expand.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on bulk orders and resells.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As tempting as it is, and yeah I even have considered it, I do not think it is worth it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What sticks out in my mind is *nobody retires and moves to an island from selling any type of drug*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly think that of everyone that tries to full time move any thing illegal, be it guns or drugs, or what have u,&nbsp; I think ends up screwing up and getting busted in the end.&nbsp; &nbsp; (if u do it for to long)&nbsp; &nbsp;(sure u can do it a few times and get out of the game, but who does that?)<br /><br />Am I completely wrong here?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think just personal amounts are much safer, and there is no pot of gold at the end of the seller life rainbow.<br /><br />Of course there is a 3rd type, but that is the good old Big Brother, LE people, that wake up every day trying to find meaning in their lives by fighting a war that will never end.&nbsp; &nbsp;( not much else needs to be said about that)<br /><br />Thoughts?<br />

				There isn&#039;t any profit to be had with bulk sales on SR.&nbsp; The shipping becomes too risky the bigger the order and you are better off buying locally. <br /><br />SR is designed for 1 gram purchases for the weekend for a average user.<br /><br />Bulk just doesn&#039;t work through the mail.&nbsp; Just like shipping booze.&nbsp; It becomes not worth it at some point.<br />The key to profit is many many many little orders.&nbsp; This requires a system and a assmebly line operation of workers.<br /><br />AVerage sellers earn about $350,000. per yr .&nbsp; &nbsp;Its not bad.<br /><br />

That is obviously not the case. Christin found 560 unique sellers and 112 &quot;core&quot; sellers who were on the site for the whole 6 months that he scraped it. There are a lot of small time and short lasting sellers on SR. Over half don&#039;t last longer than 3 months. (See the paper below)<br /><br />If we assume that there are always about 200 sellers on the site, and the ones who leave get replaced by an equal number of newcomers, then the average yearly revenue per seller is $75,000. Note: that&#039;s revenue, not profit.<br /><br /><br />https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~nicolasc/publications/TR-CMU-CyLab-12-018.pdf

				Bulk is totally worth it. I order qps of bud and used to order hundreds of x pills. And I make a hefty profit. I would pay almost double for same quality bud IRL and&nbsp; more than double for worse quality x pills where I&#039;m from. When I order the rolls I have the best pills around. And I make huge profits.

				There is plenty of money to be made even when not ordering bulk.&nbsp; To me bulk is a couple grand on one order.<br /><br />QP of shrooms = $450&nbsp; &nbsp;Sell 8ths for 30= $510 profit<br /><br />QP of dank = $850&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sell OZ&#039;s. for 350=&nbsp; $550 profit<br /><br />10g of MDMA = $528&nbsp; &nbsp;Sell caps of 125mg @ 15 = $672 profit<br /><br />If you can just make one flip of each every month that yields $1732 working with small orders and all domestic (3 days delivery).&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to cop kilo&#039;s of molly and lbs of dank to make some money.

				OP you only listed two.. and you are way off, like others have said there is plenty of money to be made if you take the right precautions.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any of them have aspirations of retiring to their own private island, well maybe it crosses a few of their minds.&nbsp; <br /><br />This new wave of newbies post too much BS that pertains to absolutely nothing aka this thread and the OP... why am i here, oh thats right just leaving&nbsp;

				Well, thank u Dr,&nbsp; &nbsp;for taking the time to come in, read my thread,&nbsp; click reply, and give your opinion on why I * newbie * should not make such thread.<br /><br />I will most certainly keep that in mind next time I post random things that relate to SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				do i plan on retiring hell no but i can make a decent living while working a low paying job cuz thats all i can get verses being damn near broke 24/7. what would you choose. its not about who makes the most money but who lasts the longest. just because someone else thinks its not worth it doesnt mean it isnt for everyone else. for people who arent overly paranoid like me and who can make good money and keep it low key it is very much worth it. its not anymore risky in my book whether i decide to order an ounce or a qp. as long as stealth is good which it always is, it always arrives everytime .

				So far i have found no drug other than a few performance enhancing ones that i can get cheaper on SR than i can in real life, the other fact of the matter is even if i did find a nice cheap drug that i could sell for a decent profit, would i really want that product coming to my address in bulk and regularly? The answer to that is no so i find it much more in my interest to use my contacts irl in order to make profits as a vender instead of consumer.
