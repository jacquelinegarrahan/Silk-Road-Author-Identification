				I have trouble searching the forums. I usually have to retype what I&#039;m searching 3-4 times and it&#039;s the same exact wording every time. I&#039;ve never encountered problems trying to logon though.

				Adasel - I get that sporadically.&nbsp; Macs seem to connect better and faster to both Tor and SR/forums, though.<br />

				Okay thanks for that.<br />Being in the uk though macs are a rarity, so ive always been accustomed to using windows based pcs.<br />Although im thinking of changing my OS to ubuntu as i have been informed its the most secure one out there&nbsp; for privacy and such.<br />Any ideas?

				yeah tails or liberte are the most secure mate. both are linux based and they both run off a usb key in RAM, so the moment you pull the USB key or switch off everything you&#039;ve done is completely irreversibly wiped. they are a pain in the arse to set up, but i&#039;m here now running from tails on a USB stick and it runs like a dream - wouldn&#039;t consider coming here thru windoze or os X since i worked this out

				Yep, hard to reach.<br /><br />However if your torbrowser doesn&#039;t connect you, you can try the anonymox addon of firefox.<br />It is NOT SAFE but it is a tor-node, so you will be able to access SR.<br />Sometimes both site&#039;s the main and forum and sometimes just one of those two.

				Thanks for the info guys.<br />Is it worth just wiping my hard drive and putting something like ubuntu on it?<br />I dont really do fuck all with machine besides tor and the occasional round of Combat Arms.<br />Was also thinking about putting truecrypt on it.<br />Any ideas?<br />

				what are you running ATM? Windoze? you may as well install tails on a USB and keep the windoze install - it&#039;s easier for gamers than ubuntu. just make sure after you&#039;ve deleted all your tor stuff that you use ccleaner or something similar to wipe the free space

				Thanks for that mate.<br />I have been using ccleaner along with malwarebytes for a long time now, been working a treat.<br />I shouldnt have to, but my partner downloads all these &quot;free&quot; games.&nbsp; Oh guess what, getting free stuff pays a price.

				Nah i think its just certain people connecting to certain tor nodes, or whatever&nbsp; (i tried to sound technical but, i didnt work)<br /><br />I still have problems but ONCE i get connected it works okay.
