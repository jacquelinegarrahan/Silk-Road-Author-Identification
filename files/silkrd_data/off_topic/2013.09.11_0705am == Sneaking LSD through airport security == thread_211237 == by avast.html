				I am trying to figure out the best way to get blotter paper through airport security but I can&#039;t think of a good way to do so without getting caught.&nbsp; I imagine it would be worst in carry on luggage so I probably won&#039;t do that but how exactly should it be packaged?&nbsp; Would it be best to just stick it in some pieces of paper or something?

				Lol. One time I was flying with NBOMe. I had it wrapped in aluminum foil inside a pack of gum. That&#039;s it. It was in my carry on. Then I got chosen for a random search (which only consisted of a frisk and some kind of scan thing on my phone). I also had some MDMA with my NBOMe but they didn&#039;t find anything. I&#039;m not going to lie, I was pretty scared though. I&#039;m not suggesting anything here, I&#039;m just sharing a relevant story.

				all those answers above sound crazy. in your foreskin or vagina, dose your passport... right...<br /><br /><br />for moving a small amount of blotter, wrap it in plastic wrap, tape it inside of the middle of a newspaper, roll up newspaper, put it in your bag with all your other clothes and travel stuff. simple. its odorless and wont show on any scanner so don&#039;t worry. large amounts is a different story though.<br />

				Easy peasy. Wrap the blotters in a recipt and stick in your wallet with your business cards or other receipts. There&#039;s no way the X-rays can tell what that is
