				What would you prefer to have? And speaking in general terms here:<br /><br />MDMA gives a more &#039;lush&#039; feeling with less of a &#039;I need to dance&#039; feel. <br />Ecstasy has a nice combination of feeling great and higher energy than MDMA and often lasts longer but blue Monday kicks your ass. <br />Mcat or Meow is often cheaper, but not as euphoric as a pill, need to redoes more but the come down is all good. <br /><br />What say you guys?

				Mcat all the way man.<br />Thing is when I drop any of these drugs I&#039;m usually raving so it&#039;s all about what will get me dancing. With MDMA it gets too intense so I have to go sit down and end up missing most of the rave. Mcat&#039;s the perfect rave drug. Go at it like a madman an it feels good but the euphoria isnt overpowering.

				You realise Ecstacy is just the name for MDMA in pill form? If the pills you are taking are making you dance more then MDMA hey have probably been cut with a stimulant like amphetamine or caffeine

				Hmmm, I&#039;ve never tried Mcat, but I guess maybe I should? :) <br /><br />I really enjoy a good pill but am skeptical to get them simply b/c i&#039;ve been burned a lot where i&#039;m from and at festies.<br /><br />I like molly b/c i can take a quick taste, know if it is worth it to me, and be on my way. I also enjoy the feeling i recieve from it. The thing i dont like about it, is i ended up eating more of it compared to pills, which in the end costs me more.<br /><br />All in all I&#039;m an equal-opportunity MDMA eater. :)

				oh i thought we were talking about methcathinone, not mephedrone... i&#039;ve never even seen methcath, i&#039;ve always been very curious to try it<br /><br />supposedly it isn&#039;t too difficult to synth? sorry this is OT<br /><br />i like good pure MDMA a bit more honestly, but they are both pretty yummy

				I&#039;d say MDMA is prefect if your with a small group of close friends who are also taking it, with your favorite music and setting. <br />Mephedrone is more of a &#039;go fucking mental and rave&#039; drug. <br />

Although MDMA combined with MDA is meant to give the same effect as MDMA but you&#039;re also boosted along with the &#039;go fucking metal&#039; effect.. I haven&#039;t tried it personally though.

Pre-bag up means that for the rave you have a nice bag of Mandy, a nice bag of Meph and a nice bag of pre-mixed Mandy, MDA and Meph so you can go hard if you please. You do that, pop some more pills to accompany it and then hopefully you have remembered to pick up your Ket on the way out so you can sweat your Jones off and then do some bumps off a card to chill you out and make things a little bit wobblesome and interesting. You rinse and repeat until you have skanked your tits off and then you go back to the afterparty at your place and do the Blow you have to come down and chat balls to your pals with. If you are going to someone else&#039;s for an afterparty then grab the Blow on the way and fuck it maybe score some tabs if you are feeling adventurous, it&#039;s someone elses house so who gives a fuck? <br /><br />The End.

				Exactly, we must not limit ourselves to have favourite drugs, but rather favour alll the drugs apart from maybe except the Junky drugs because having to steal for a fix just isn&#039;t a &quot;Gooood tiiiiime&quot;. The more the better, the better the more.
