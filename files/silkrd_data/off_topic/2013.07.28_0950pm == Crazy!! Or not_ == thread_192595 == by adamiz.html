				Hello good people. <br />So this is a story about a person I know where I can&#039;t decide if he is right or wrong..<br /><br />I met this guy some years ago in an small town in an nice EU country. He was the one who gave me first time LSD. He adores it I could say. So after years of knowing each other and taken couple of times LSD, I decided last year to to visit him in his country and stay with him 2 weeks. He is running a small bar and he is doing pretty well with it. <br /><br />Now comes the funny part.. <br />His passion is to &quot;waking up&quot; people and talks a lot about LSD with his surroundings. He never deals I could say. But!!<br />The last two years he has done some good connections and has the ability to receive some liquid LSD where each drop is really low on dosage. Maybe 5-10ug. <br /><br />Almost none of his customers knows it, but he is actually putting one drop to almost all his drinks he gives (Maximum 1 drop per customer per day). When he told me and showed me this I was actually stunned, we talk about this a lot but until now I can&#039;t make a decision if this is ok or not.<br /><br />I mean LSD isnt&#039;t bad for your body, especially in such doses. He believes in his theory and purpose that everyone need some push in order to &quot;wake up&quot; as he calls it. I am with him 100% but do you guys think about it. I read the thread about microdosing lsd and just thought about my dear friend.<br /><br />None should make anybody take substances without knowing, but on the other hand... A small dose of lsd can&#039;t harm his people.. I guess the opposite.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Looking forward to hear your thoughts about this...<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

Consider it though more like a cocktail bar where customers go there to relax and not to get wasted. <br />Still your answer is more than appreciated :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=192595.msg1388041#msg1388041">Quote from: Mcrad on July 28, 2013, 10:10 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">1 drop is not microdosing my friend.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read microdosing is about 1/4 - 1/2 of a tab. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s why I already mention that each drop is 5-20ug, not 100-150ug as you usually can find.<br />If it was like this, I am pretty sure he would be in jail by now...<br /><br />Read carefully as I write carefully my friend. <br />Have a nice day/night<br /><br />Adamiz
