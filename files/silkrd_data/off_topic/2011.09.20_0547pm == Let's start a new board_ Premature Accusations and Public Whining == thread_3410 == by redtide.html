				&quot;It&#039;s been 45min since I made my order and it&#039;s not marked in transit, I call scam&quot;<br />(dramatization)<br /><br />Seriously folks. If you can&#039;t get through a little waiting time before you start yelling scam<br />and asking people to hold your hand, buy F2F.<br /><br />It&#039;s getting really old.

				Ok <br />I&#039;ll match you with the IP H vendor thing. It&#039;s been going on for weeks. Missit, Keasy, CaptJohnny, blah, blah, you get the idea.<br />Just as many scams as false scams. Phoney reviews, out of escrow sales, etc.<br />Sure, nothing is perfect.<br />Beats having a gun or knife pulled on you any day.<br />Would be nice that when it says in transit, it means it&#039;s been shipped but a bunch of vendors don&#039;t see it that way.<br />To them it means, &quot;I am thinking about shipping the product when I get to it&quot;<br />Nothing shipped in the same country should take more than 5 days.<br />Misunderstandings will then happen.<br /><br />Strangely enough other vendors ship product to your door in 2 days.<br />Big difference, and they should be richly rewarded for that service.<br />

				It&#039;s easy (for me) to tell the serious sellers from the not-so-serious.<br /><br />Serious sellers almost always:<br /><br />&nbsp;- are timely and professional in their listings and communications, even when there is a disagreement or negativity.<br />&nbsp;- check and respond messages at least once per day (the better sellers do this every few hours).<br />&nbsp;- check and process orders at least once per day (for shipment in-transit).<br />&nbsp;- never lists a transaction as shipped/in-transit until it is actually shipped.<br />&nbsp;- have professional and discrete exterior packaging.<br />&nbsp;- has their product heat-sealed in 3 bags, with a visibility mask inside the layers in case there is damage during shipping. Then you still can not see whats being shipped.<br />&nbsp;- are generally very visible, professional, and responsive<br />&nbsp;- have vacation mode on if they will be away for more than 24-48 hours plus show this status on their profile page.<br />&nbsp;- complete all orders prior to going in vacation mode.<br /><br />I will not buy from sellers with a poor to non-existent verifiable history of the above attributes. Sure, you might say new sellers need to be given a chance. I suggest letting the addicts do that for us. They will buy a lot because of their addiction and share their results with us. Additionally, it will be more about price and availability than seller quality to them.<br /><br />Use forum and feedback heavily and do not be afraid to ask questions before the sale.<br /><br />My thing is that I want to use only serious sellers, and even though the not-so-serious sellers may be legitimate, their service suffers, the transactions usually take much longer, and the buyer may be in more danger. More danger because the seller does not take it as seriously as other sellers and might cut corners, rush, or skimp on something, or worst of all, they might not be knowledgeable enough to take certain precautions that may cause the package to be red flagged.<br /><br />We are all criminals in the eyes of those with power of force over us.<br /><br />We are taking a stand against their system and risking our freedom and wealth.<br /><br />I think more people should take that seriously and buyers should vote with their sales to very serious vendors who go to great lengths to protect their buyers.<br /><br />
