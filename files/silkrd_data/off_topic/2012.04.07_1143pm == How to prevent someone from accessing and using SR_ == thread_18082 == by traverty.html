				just what the title says. he&#039;s a fool and just found out about sr. due to a combo of stupidity and laziness he has yet to make any purchases but he&#039;s determined and im sure he eventually will try. If he manages to successfully use sr it will be bad for both the online community and his own. I have access to his computer. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

				Replace the SR URL with a fake URL that brings him to a site identical to SR much in the way phishers do. If he&#039;s as stupid as you make him seem he wont notice it and wont be able to buy anything.

				Block the default Tor port in windows firewall. Problem is windows is designed for fools so he will probably figure out how to allow it through. Why don&#039;t you just order stuff for said fool

In any case who set you up as the moral guardian of the Silk Road? I&#039;d been indulging in racketeering and money laundering&nbsp; for six years before I&#039;d even heard of it! Stop behaving like a spoilt child who won&#039;t share his toys -what&#039;s the worst he could do after all?
