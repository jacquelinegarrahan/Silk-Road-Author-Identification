				In order to legally possess a card you need to have cancer, hiv/aids, or some disease that causes pain and/or nausea. Since i have none of these is it still possible for me to get a card? I know that a doctor has to write you a prescription so that you can be put down in the registry or whatever.<br /><br />So basically what i am asking is can i fake a prescription or are there doctors who will give you a prescription like that?<br /><br />On a side note, what will such a prescription say? Will it have like a dosage on it, &quot;Patient X can get 3.5g of Sour diesel&quot; or will it just say, &quot;Patient X is eligible to get high&quot;..LOL.

				I believe it will depend what state you are in, but marijuana can be used for a variety of conditions. These include migraines, ADD, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, anorexia, and much more.<br /><br />Marijuana dispensaries verify ID and call/check online to verify your doctors recommendation on your first visit, so a fake likely wouldn&#039;t work past this point. Look up local places that provide recommendations or evaluations. Some places take 5 minutes of paperwork, 45 minutes of sitting in a waiting room receiving coupons for nearby dispensaries, and about 15 seconds with the doctor signing your recommendation.<br /><br />Check your state laws for details. It should state what medical conditions qualify for medical marijuana use.<br /><br />Ah, and once you have your rec it&#039;s pretty much &quot;Patient X is eligible to get high.&quot; You get to choose your own meds.

				If you live in California or Colorado it is really easy to get a recommendation. They have MMJ &#039;clinics&#039; there that will give you a rec without too much trouble. Other states like Arizona make it much more difficult to get recommended and have a lot fewer qualifying conditions. Still if you go to your real doctor a couple of times complaining of severe migraines and nausea your doctor records should be enough to get you a card from a MMJ clinic doc.

				Dammmnnnnn that sounds good. The prices in my local state dispensaries are $20-30 less than what SR charges and some of them not only carry some nice strains but a whole slew of edibles, gear and what not. Too bad i am in good shape from all the running i do so i cant really get a prescription for anything!!! :(<br /><br />&quot;Look up local places that provide recommendations or evaluations&quot; - What would an example of such a place be? Are you talking about like a Doctor&#039;s clinic or what?

				Check out Weed Maps (google).&nbsp; Go up and select Find &gt; Doctors. You should be able to list by state/area as well.

				It all depends on the state you are in and how tightly they regulate it. In Nevada you can get one for &quot;chronic headaches&quot;, and all along the freeways are billboards advertising &quot;service providers&quot; that claim to have doctors on staff and you can basically buy one.<br /><br />Might want to google into that...

				Yea i am not scared about going there but there is absolutely nothing wrong with me (thank god for that) so what do i tell them? Why do i need a card? Cos i love weed? LOLOLOL!<br /><br />The only excuse i could think of was that i could say that i keep getting headaches or some shit. OR that i fell on the stairs or something and my back hurts..both sound dumb to me :)

Mainly because the DMV is involved in licensing one way or another so they need your ID/DL number to attach the license to.

				Some states allow you to posses mmj with a card from another state but not buy from their local dispensaries. I know in California you can get a card using a hotel address if you are from out of town. They are really easy on mmj card applicants there.

				Ok so i have decided to suck it up and go to one of these clinics to get an evaluation. Was wondering if you guys have any recommendations on what kind of excuse i could make up that would sound legit enough. I am relatively young (but over 25) so do you think they will even recommend it for me?
