				Hello. I&#039;m going to Amsterdam in these days and I&#039;d like to send to an address of mine a letter with 1-2 grams of nice weed or hash. <br />Obviously I don&#039;t have a vacuum sealer so I was thinking to purchase some zip lock bags,press the stuff like hell then ship through a standard envelope,is it possible to buy some post stamps from a tobacco seller then ship the letter from a post box ? I prefer to avoid post offices you know..<br /><br />Have some questions btw<br /><br /><br />- How much those post stamps costs and what kind of stamp I&#039;ve to buy (airmail,standard etc..) ? I have to ship the letter to Italy<br /><br />- There&#039;s a limit of weight by sending letter from a post box ?<br /><br /><br />Thank you and peace&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Probably not a good idea, I&#039;m sure people try to do that all the time when in Amsterdam.

				Thank you for the answer, Of course a letter from Amsterdam is always suspicious,that&#039;s why I want to ship only few grams

				I would get some heat seal bags And use the hotel iron to seal them up. Then I would buy some peanut butter open the jar, hollow the center put the bag in that, then with left over peanut butter smooth the top, and readsive the seal on the peanut butter jar its self. Box it up mail to yourself.

				I was speaking to a friend of mine about a month ago whom had just got back from Amsterdam and he said he put about 6g in a CD case and just mailed it back to himself (lives in UK). The 6g was just in the bags that they come from the coffee shops in and the address hand written and everything, maybe he just got lucky.

				Came back from Amsterdam a few weeks back, successfully posted back 13g in one package. Combination of the above posts really.<br /><br />Best to use a DVD case for maximum space rather than a CD case. Then if you want to go the low tech route just get yourself some smelly proof baggies, which I have used in the past but tend to be best for hash. If you load up one of those with 10g of Super Lemon Haze from Greenhouse you are in trouble :P<br /><br />My advice would be to get some anti static ESD bags from ebay or the like. If you can source 3M manufactured bags these tend to be the best, make sure they are heat seal able. Then buy yourself the cheapest pair of hair straighteners your can, mine cost Â£4, and take that lot in your bag. They work an absolute dream. Very easy to seal up and no smell leakage. My parcel of 13g of bud was waiting on my doormat for a week and still no smell when I opened it and that was with a single layer. Once sealed place inside the DVD case, might require a bit of crushing. Simply pop that in a jiffy bag and you are golden.<br /><br />As for the actual postage, for me it cost me 4eu to send it priority to the UK. Easiest post office to post from in the center for my money is the one behind the royal palace in Dam Square. Forgotten the name but a quick Google search you should be able to find it. They asked no questions simply weighed it up for me and then placed it into the post box.<br /><br />Hope that helps.<br /><br />Best of luck to you. Nothing better to ease post Dam depression then arriving home to a fat parcel waiting for you :)
