				They keep changing their tactics. The only way to stop them is to make more spam mods probably. I think they just did 12 solid pages of spam. Nominate me a spam buster and allow me to deputize people and set up a donation fund for the spam squad. It&#039;s not even spam at this point. This is a DDOS attack. The scam probably worked a few times a couple months ago but this is a coordinated attack against the forum.

				I&#039;ve seen at least one person who runs a simplemachines forum themselves say it&#039;s very easy to stop spam like this, and that the only reason that it wouldn&#039;t be done is if someone just didn&#039;t care.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really speak to that, personally (never had anything to do with the SMF software), but I hope it isn&#039;t true.&nbsp; I hate to think that&#039;s how DPR and the admins here feel.

				Personally I think the point is that the mods work really hard to delete this spam, and they shouldn&#039;t have to.&nbsp; An admin can change the forum configuration or enable add-ons or plugins or whatever the Hell simplemachines calls the things.<br /><br />More mods would help, but they shouldn&#039;t have to waste their time cleaning up spam when it apparently could be blocked in the first place.
