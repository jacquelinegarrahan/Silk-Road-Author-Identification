				Hi everyone,<br /><br />At last we have had the opportunuty (and time) to revamp our site. We tore away all but the essentials in hope that it is compatable with all browsers (there were issues) and faster with TOR.&nbsp; Meat and bones. All is very well. If you want you can check it out here - http://426bznbgjzwd2nhp.onion/.&nbsp; We&#039;re happy for any suggestions.<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />DiMiTri<br />&nbsp;

				For all those wanting to order from DiMiTriSpice - a warning. Yes, his product is good and when it arrives, you will find happiness. However, shipping and communication SUCK. I&#039;ve lost about $150 after two months of back-and-forth about my order made in May 2012. I could have had my DMT and Changa MUCH sooner if I ordered from anyone else. Previously, I did receive the product from DiMiTriSpice but it took about a month to arrive. <br /><br />He claims to be busy / overloaded with messages, so any messages are usually ignored. Why not get an assistant or stop selling so much without being able to deliver?<br /><br />It sucks to be sitting with no bitcoins and no product and wonder where is the order and who has it!<br /><br />When the product is marked as &quot;shipped&quot; it is not really shipped. When my last order arrived, the shipping date did not match the &quot;marked as shipped&quot; date - it was off by a few weeks (!).<br /><br />I don&#039;t care how good his product is. With that kind of shipping and communication, I won&#039;t be ordering again. Every other vendor on SR, even those from the most remote locations, manage to get my order to me in less than two weeks and keep in touch with any updates. What&#039;s so special about this guy?<br /><br />My advice, if you end up ordering anyway, for the love of elves, do not finalize until you have the product in your hand. There is no tracking of any kind so once you finalize and don&#039;t receive the product, say goodbye to your coins.

This is the fourth thread I&#039;ve come across with you spouting your shit about this vendor. Yes, shipping can and will most likely take a while and messages might not always be answered, get the fuck over it. Nobody is forcing you to use DiMiTriSpice as a vendor. I see you still received your product, correct? Then why the hell are you still going on about it? <br /><br />Quit copy/pasting your bullshit rant just so everyone knows how &quot;terrible&quot; your experience was.<br /><br />sdesu<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha, is he paying you to protect him or something?<br /><br />No, I didn&#039;t receive my product. Maybe my writing isn&#039;t perfectly clear, but what I said is that I received my first order and it took one month to arrive, but the second order has never arrived after I spent literally two+ months of back-and-forth with him promising me to ship multiple times. I lost money, but most importantly it was a lot of nerves while waiting and lost opportunity to try it at the right place and time.<br /><br />Not a single well-reviewed vendor gave me such bad shipping/comm. experience like this guy. I&#039;ve ordered DMT and other stuff from many reputable vendors and NOT ONCE the order got lost.<br /><br />No, I did not act like an asshole. No, I did not keep messaging him every day about the order. I was respectful, patient, and firm. I don&#039;t even care about the lost money. Shit, I&#039;m glad I lost only so little. It just pisses me off that vendors can pull that sort of bullshit and continue being treated like heroes. Selective scamming, anyone?<br /><br />Now that he refuses to refund my money and has no proof of actually shipping anything, what can I do? Post negative feedback? Haha, my feedback will be buried behind 100&#039;s of other orders made since.<br /><br />I had a shitty experience and I want to warn others from having it. So I&#039;ll post my feedback where it will be seen. Not every SR user comes here anyway, so maybe 10% of potential buyers will see it.<br /><br />Stop treating this vendor like some sort of god. He&#039;s here for the money and you&#039;re here for the product. If he doesn&#039;t deliver what he promises, he shouldn&#039;t get our trust and our money.

				honest oppinion counts for alot. theres many different vendors about &amp; just because someone speaks up about the negatives of a specific transaction doesnt mean you guys should attack it. <br /><br /><br />never ordered from Dimitri; had plenty of other orders from other dmt vendors.<br /><br />your torpage doesnt look like its been updates though dimitri.<br /><br />ALSO what happened with the L, the MDMA and the other treats you were promising a few weeks back?<br />AND what happened to specific country / continent vendors?

				blasting someone to no end doesnt do either party, nor anyone reading it; any good. <br /><br />if i&#039;d had a very negative experiance though, i think i had reserved the right to be verbal about it, but not only once to get lost in a thread. its all about the trajectory and projection of your argument. pushing anything to the extreme doesnt do good.<br /><br />im in the same place, never ordered from this vendor and tbh i dont think i will. <br /><br />never heard 1 single bad word about trojan ;)<br /><br />altho things just seem to melt and warp on his DMT. not necessarily a bad thing but the first time i smoked it came from some crazy hippie squatter i met at an illegal rave, the walls melted n i was thrown hurtling through space, watching the geometric shapes pass me by until i came to a mighty presence, the outline of a being silhouetted in space. i opened my eyes and knew i had experienced something profound, the only words to pass my lips were &#039;shaman.&#039; he smiled and passed the pipe =]

If you&#039;re not happy, then find someone else. Honestly, DiMiTriSpice could come out and say &quot;hey fuck you guys, I&#039;m done.&quot; and I would not be hurt one bit. There are several other vendors on Silk Road that offer the same product as DiMiTri does. It&#039;s really not a big deal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey, I didn&#039;t come to SR expecting stellar customer service and money back guarantee. I understand not to treat this place like any regular shopping site. <br /><br />But think of it that way. I&#039;m giving my money and my personal info, information that potentially can put me in jail, to a vendor. He then proceeds to promise me a delivery for a really long time. He doesn&#039;t say &quot;yes&quot;, doesn&#039;t say &quot;no&quot;, he is really hard to reach, I&#039;m stressed out for months not knowing whether I can order more or someone has intercepted the package or what. This type of behavior gradually turned me from a very patient customer to someone else. He acts irresponsibly and holds on to my money and info when I get nothing in return.<br /><br />And you know what? I have a VERY good reason to suspect that he never sent me shit, because every other vendor has had NO issues delivering me the package, be it domestic or international.<br /><br />But forget all this. I moved on. If DiMiTriSpice improves, hey, I&#039;m sure this thread and SR will be full of positive reviews. So far on his feedback page I see very few happy customers.

				I&#039;ve heard great things about DiMiTri&#039;s product, but not so much about shipping/waiting time, which makes me wary of ordering from him. I&#039;d like to purchase a large amount of DMT, but there is another vendor who has seemingly equal product with better shipping and communication. Hopefully DiMiTri will post back and offer an explanation, whatever that may be, and tell us what he&#039;s going to do to fix it. Many of his reviews show that there&#039;s some kind of communication issue, but I doubt he&#039;s a scammer or he wouldn&#039;t have a fair share of excellent reviews free of complaints.<br /><br />I probably won&#039;t be ordering from him, but if he comes back and gives an explanation and his reviews improve (and they&#039;re not bad, other vendors just have better ones on a more consistent basis) I&#039;d definitely get into contact with him.
