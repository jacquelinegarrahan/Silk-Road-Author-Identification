				So I&#039;ve had a very interesting experience when I finally decided to go to a pain clinic in S.FL. Read on...<br /><br />...waited 4 hours in line, passed a piss test, and had blood work done. Finally got to see a doctor (which means I must have passed the piss test, so 19 days off weed is enough apparently :) ) and got 4 scripts, 3 for non narco, 1 for narco pain meds. Also got a BS script to go do physical therapy.<br /><br />Great! I think to my self &quot;let&#039;s go to Walgreens&quot;! Well six or seven pharmacies later, nobody carries this shit (Dilaudid 8mg), one pharmacy even told me the doctor was black listed with them, and most other places kinna gave me the stink eye.<br /><br />Anyways, I called up few less know places given to me by the pain clinic, and turns out they have this shit in stock. So Tuesday I have to visit a pharmacy and bring 4 scripts (!??!?!?!) apparently they need 3 non narco to go with 1 narco, WTH???<br /><br />SO is this the name of the game? I have to go to less than reputable pharmacies, and the doctor already knows I need 4 scripts, 3 bullshit ones, before I can take the good meds?<br /><br />Please fill me in...

				yea man that&#039;s how it goes. I think some pharmacies will let you buy some scripts when you get the money. Maybe you can tell them you will be back for the rest of the scripts. Just talk to them and see but you may want to get all them filled so it don&#039;t look suspicious.<br /><br />I passed a drug tes the next day after smoking a fatty but I hadn&#039;t been smoking every day. I just use straight water. I went to work and when I clocked in my boss gave me the papers and told me to go. I stopped at a gas station on the way and drank water there until my piss looked like pure water. It took a couple hours but was worth it. I had also took 2 hydros that very morning. My boss never said a word about it

				Hydromorphone tends to make pharmacists jumpy. I reckon lots of robberies would never have occurred if there was no such thing as hydromorphone.
