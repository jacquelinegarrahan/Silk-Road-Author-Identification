				Well I have limited experience with both substances, done LSD twice and 2c-b once. But from my experience 2c-b had more intense &#039;visuals&#039; and had a much shorter duration. I tripped for a good 10 hours on 200ug&#039;s of LSD... 2c-b had a more intense &#039;come up&#039; but that might have been because I snorted it (which burnt like fuck) Overall I prefer LSD... both were great but with LSD even though it didn&#039;t &#039;uplift&#039; my mood instantly, when the euphoria did come it was the most beautiful feeling I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of having.

				Depends what you&#039;re doing, 2-cb if you just want to party, but LSD if you&#039;re doing more introspective things like just hanging in the woods or sitting at home.

				No, I understand completely. LSD and shrooms both leave me feeling &#039;hungover&#039; the next day, at least my hungover which is no puking or anything just sort of lazy and brain fried, and I normally do day time trips so staying up late has nothing to do with it. <br /><br />On 25i nbome I didn&#039;t have that feeling the next day, but I also didn&#039;t have the nice relaxing come down either. With LSD and shrooms, when my trip starts coming down it feels like a really excellent weed high, slightly energetic, want to express myself and talk a lot but words stumble out of my mouth still. 25i nbome come down was more like the feeling itself just went away but left me with some residual visuals, like watching tv afterwards and seeing subtle visuals every 5-10 mins or so.

				It&#039;s funny how different these drugs are for different people. A lot of people get side effects from 2c-x&#039;s, like splitting headaches or muscle spasms. I don&#039;t get any side effects at all from 2c-b (at 30mg anyway). I get nausea and occasionally pukeyness from LSD, most people don&#039;t. <br /><br />My attempt at a comparison based on my own experiences: <br /><br />The visuals on 2c-b tend to be more prevalent at comparable dosage. I get a lot of laser-light show type visuals on 2c-b, and the closed-eye visuals are crazy intense. That said, I think the visuals on LSD are more subtle but more intense in some ways.&nbsp; It&#039;s a little hard to explain if you haven&#039;t done them both, but there&#039;s a hyper-intensity to the visual experience of LSD that I haven&#039;t yet found in anything else. It&#039;s like you were living your life at 480p and BAM, shits is 1080p all of the sudden. Also, I think the visual fingerprint of LSD and 2c-b are different. With 2c-b, the form constants I got tended to be repeating geometric patterns, colorful but not real complex. LSD form constants have a bit more variety for me, but tend to be complex fractal patterns with more texture and depth, but not so sparkly. Some people report melting on 2c-b, but I didn&#039;t get that so much. <br /><br />The body high on 2c-b was really nice. At times the body buzz is almost overwhelming, like 2-tons of pillows smashing you into the couch. LSD has a similar body euphoria for me, but it takes longer to kick in and usually starts as an intense restlessness, rather than the relaxation I get from 2c-b. Sex is great on both (for me anyway, some people lose all drive on LSD). They both make me crazy horny, but it seemed like 2c-b was more erotic. You are definitely more in tune with your body on 2c-b, and less likely to get distracted or weirded out during sex. Food is nice on 2c-b. I eat just find on acid but some (most?) people find their hunger-drive totally shut down. <br /><br />It seems like the headspace is the biggest difference between the two. 2c-b was very clear-headed for me. I&#039;m pretty much useless for the first two or three hours of an acid trip, I can get &quot;stuck&quot; for a good 15 minutes on something as simple as putting my fucking clothes back on at higher doses of LSD, but 2c-b wasn&#039;t debilitating at all, just a little demotivating. 2c-b was emotionally neutral to mildly euphoric. I was giggly and easily amused. LSD has a harder edge, can push you to places you don&#039;t necessarily want to go, feel more overwhelming, etc. I can&#039;t even begin to describe the weird shit that gets into your head on acid, the language of a sane person really can&#039;t do it justice. <br /><br />TL;DR: You&#039;ll see shit on both of them, but LSD tends to be a more intense ride and 2c-b is more body-buzz dominant, very little mindfuck.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				i think strangeman hit it in the head.. good post bro..&nbsp; my first experience with 2cb i thought it was coke at first.. ( package mixup)&nbsp; about 100 mg came in i was lie damn i got ripped off on a .5 g of coke so i did about 1/2 of the 100 mg bag straight up the nose.. IT BURNED SO FUCKING BAD!&nbsp; i was like what the fuck is in this coke???.. and 15 mins later im tripping my balls off at work seeing laser light shows and the room was filling up with water bottles ...&nbsp; sheesh what a crazy night that was.. i did hear some audio distortion like echoes when people talked..... it fucked with me bad :P i never got audio hallucination on lsd..&nbsp; the good thing about 2cb is if your not enjoying it 3 hours later and your getting close to baseline again with some enjoyable residuals.. but lsd&nbsp; you are in it for the duration.. 8- 12 hours... wehn im inside a house or building on LSD everything seems dirty or dingy and it bothers me (weird huh) but being outside sets me free seing the trees blowing when theres no wind :P&nbsp; nature and animals (and music) are the only thing that keeps me somewhat sane on lsd :)
