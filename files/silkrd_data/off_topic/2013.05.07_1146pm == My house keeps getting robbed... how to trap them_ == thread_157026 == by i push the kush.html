				Okay, so my house has been robbed about 3 times in the past month, the first and second time money and some MDMA was taken. Well last week I got a security camera and I put like a QP of epsom salt in a bag and put it in my room. I came home from work today and the bag of salt was gone and there were no pics or video on my camera cuz I have it times to shut off at 4PM and I didnt get home til 430pm so I think it happened in that time frame. Anyways what is a good way to trap someone or something? I thought about putting 500mg of some china white in a capsule and when it turns up missing ill see who turns up dead, its their fault for mistaking it for MDMA lol but idk, gimmie some ideas for trapping someone for real. And yes I have an idea of who it is, but I just havent caught them on camera yet and I really dont care if they die cuz they are stealing my shit lol

				this is what you should do, first clean your home of all narcotics, or anyhting associated, then drive to the junk yard or somewhere you can find boxes of high end televisions and things of that sort, then remove your computer and anything else associated to tor or sr, (best safe than sorry) and if you dont already have a gun get one, after go and put all your boxes out to the curb on the day after your trrash has been taken so that it can be out there for the longest possible time, take your car and go park it somewhere down the road, walk home, and now comes the hard part, wait till they try to break in once that happen you know what to do to, next go out your backdoor call the cops tell them what happens and in the meantime go get your car, make sure you get no blood i the car

Epsom salts act as a laxative in high doses.<br /><br />Realistically though, exploding dye packs are your only man for the job. There are DIY guides online but be prepared for EVERYTHING that the dye touches to be permanently stained. If you use the right kind of dye it will stick to the person&#039;s skin for a number of days - how long can the person you think it is avoid you for? 8)<br /><br />Libertas

				Step 1: Don&#039;t be a a bitch. I mean common.. <br /><br />Step 2: Take a day of work, make sure all your friends think your going away and know your drugs are at home.<br /><br />Step 3: Wait for him/them (likely more than 1 person) to break in.<br /><br />Step 4: Use an unidentifiable blunt object to knock the fuck out of that piece of shit excuse for a human. The rest will likely run away, But you will know who they are at least. <br /><br />Step 5: DO NOT CALL THE COPS!!! Fuck I mean all the guy has to do is rat you and he is a free man.<br /><br />Step 6: Repeat step 4 until satisfied..<br /><br />Step 7: Repeat step 6 again for good measure.<br /><br />Step 8: Drug the unconscious pleb and dump him in the worst area you know..<br /><br />-Problem solved and no legal issues-<br />-Gained respect, don&#039;t expect a break in again unless they have a gun-<br /><br />Don&#039;t use a gun as a weapon. You get bigger weapons, so will they. <br /><br />Wear gloves HUUR DUUR!<br /><br />Your welcome&nbsp; 8)<br />&nbsp;

				Obviously someone close to you, they can most likely see you entering/leaving, etc.<br /><br />Find out where they live by leaving something there they can take. <br /><br />Put a GPS on it.<br /><br />Stake your place out and wait.<br /><br />You will have the scum bags address.<br /><br />My imagination is running wild right now, so i&#039;ll leave it up to you,&nbsp; for i&#039;m sure yours is also.<br /><br />If it was me.....i better not say, theres some very touchy people on this forum, so i wont say it.<br /><br />Do they only take drugs, or other shit as well?<br /><br />Do they break in, or is your security basically non-existent?<br /><br />Get a dog.<br /><br />NO GUNS. Once you pull the trigger, its all over, forget about it. Besides, thats too easy, any pussy can shoot a gun.<br /><br />Personally i like knives, but that can still be used against you.<br /><br />Its not going to end well. Change your locks, etc.<br /><br />Or you just break in there, drop some evidence, and call the police, fuck i&#039;d put half a glassware kit and precursors in there so they put him away for intent to manufacture, etc. <br /><br />You can be smart about this. Dont let one ignoramus fuck up your future.<br /><br />Good luck, and i hope you dont lose shit again.

				maybe it&#039;s because I grew up in the southwest and have always lived in Castle Doctrine states, but if someone I don&#039;t know comes into my house uninvited, I have a family that comes first and foremost. Call me a pussy if you want, but if someone invades my home, where my wife and children sleep, the last thing through their mind will be &quot;oh shit&quot;.<br /><br />As far as trapping someone- no. This isn&#039;t Home Alone, if you try to trap someone in your house, you now have an angry person to deal with who may or may not be physically superior to you. The security cam is a good idea if it&#039;s someone you know, but if you get footage of a stranger robbing your house, it doesn&#039;t do you much good. <br /><br />If you live in a Castle Doctrine state, and you have a gun, you are fully within your rights to defend your home. The key there is to kill them, not wound or maim them. A dead person that invaded your home is 100% in the wrong and you are liable for nothing. A wounded person has a chance to drag shit through courts or try to do some of that crap you hear about in the news at times where the burglar is now a &quot;victim&quot;. Don&#039;t give them that chance.<br /><br />States where the Castle Doctrine protects you in your home (e.g. you can kill an invader without legal repercussion as long as you feel your life is in danger): AL, AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MS, MT, MN, MO, NV, NH, NC, ND, NJ, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, TN, TX, UT, WA, WV, WI, WY.<br /><br />

				Take some Ketamine, mix with a little novacane (or similar numbing cutting agent often found in coke). Label bag as coke and leave a nice big fan line next to it with a rolled up bank note. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />

				What shuvool said.<br /><br />Remember that African arsehole who shot his hot girlfriend in the bathroom?<br /><br />Well he got away with it didnt he, the slimy fuck.<br /><br />So yeah, catch him in there and blow his fucking head off.<br /><br />But again thats too easy, i&#039;d put 2 knives through the tops of his hands through and into a table.<br /><br />If he gets smart, twist them one by one. And just calmly say, if you ever want to touch your own dick again, let alone use your hands to eat, then i suggest you leave town.<br /><br />Ah fuck it, just shoot him. Your in the USA. Ira will cheer you.

				I say fill some caps with cyanide. You can&#039;t get in trouble for it because it is suicide. He took them himself. It&#039;s the easiest way because then you don&#039;t have to think about it or waste your time and effort.<br /><br />Leave out the pills and when they are gone resume life. The guy will not be coming back :D<br /><br />Chaos
