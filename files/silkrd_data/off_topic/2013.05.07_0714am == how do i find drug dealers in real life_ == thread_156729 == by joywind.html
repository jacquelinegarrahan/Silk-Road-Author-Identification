				Go to columbia ask the nearest local if you can get hold of a 10 kilos of cocaine and would like to speak to the man in charge straight away<br /><br />make sure you tell him you have the cash on you right now so the transaction will be quick<br /><br />- meet the guy<br />- do the transaction<br />- get first plane back to your country with the product&nbsp; in multiple manbags (make sure you carry them all yourself &amp; they have to be either gucci or louis vitton branded or this wont work )<br />- get home safely and start<br /><br />goodluck with everything

				Since you&#039;re about the money and not the fun im guessing you don&#039;t care what you&#039;re selling as long as people are buying.<br /><br />It seems as though you live in a city if not im sure you&#039;re within driving distance of one. Buy some MDMA in bulk on here and head over to raves.<br /><br />Ravers don&#039;t rob and they pay the prices youll ask especially for the quality you&#039;ll be selling.<br />You could even get some speed and put ecstasy in capsules (very cheap at your local drug store or on clearweb)<br /><br />Also look at upcoming modern day Woodstock&#039;s such as Camp Bisco, Tommorrowland Burning man etc. I am not a hippie or raver but its like taking candy from a baby except they&#039;re paying you. A lot of these festivals LEO will even stay away from you.<br /><br />-JOS<br /><br /><br />

I have seen big guys, streetwise and been around for a long time getting chopped up by a little guy you wouldn&#039;t look twice at. You think your big and tough because your tall with muscle? The most that will help you with is people who are scared by what you look like. <br />And your whole game plan is to sell to teenagers? Bravo. <br />FYI most of the people on here dont waste their money away on drugs they cant afford. It&#039;s like the same as when somebody goes to the liquor store and buys themselves a bottle of Jack daniels. they decide they want some say LSD and buy it with their hard earned money, Hardly wasting their life saving on a smack addiction. <br /><br />I thought in your Op you wanted to sell drugs on SR as a vendor, Now you want to sell to teenagers, You gunna stand outside a school with your 2 hits of LSD and dime bags? <br /><br />The best advice you have gotten so far is from jack of spades, That actually is good advice, i would take it if i were you because nobody else will waste their time helping you. How can you say you hate drug users/dealers but want to be one and sell to the other. it&#039;s bloody stupid. <br /><br />How do you cut LSD? Easy you dumb fuck, you &quot;water it down&quot; in some way to put it simply, Or you dont dose it properly. Why do people cut a drug that is cheap anyway? because they are fucking greedy cunts and they want more money. when they have an ounce they say ohh fuck making $500 it&#039;s only dumb teenagers im selling to i want to make $700 for example. <br /><br />Grow up. Get a life. And realize what the world is all about before you start trying to be a gangster you fucking wannabe .
