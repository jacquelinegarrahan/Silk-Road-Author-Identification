				So recently I travelled to a country where they don&#039;t put your head on a spike for possession of a gram of weed for an SR-fueled drug binge in a hotel, and most of the vendors came through so I was set to try all sorts of new substances.<br /><br />One of these was some shrooms (well, sclerotia stones, and my first real psilocin experience), of which I intentionally took a massive dose (I think like 1.5 oz dried) to ensure a strong trip, and I ended up on the floor chewing on things like an infant and repeating a nonsensical mantra I was receiving from alien spider beings over and over again for 3 hours.<br /><br />That&#039;s another story, but it&#039;s worth noting because 2 days later I was planning to try MDMA for the first time, and I had brought along about 180 mics of 3jane&#039;s acid to perhaps candyflip with, and the ungodly dose of shrooms pretty much made the LSD worthless due to tolerance.<br /><br />But anyway, I did the acid, and having tons of experience with this acid I knew very well that basically nothing except vasoconstriction was on the menu as of 90 minutes in, so I said oh well and took the MDMA (had 200mgs in 2 pills, but chickened out and broke one of them making for a 150mg or so dose, which is apparently medium-high for my body size).<br /><br />Anyway, the MDMA was okay. I mean honestly, feeling kinda happy and compelled to nod my head and walk around eating hotel ice for a few hours didn&#039;t really justify the name or hype of ecstasy for me, especially when considering how shallow the experience was and how badly I would soon realize I had chewed up the inside of my cheeks among other after-effects, but before digressing too much...<br /><br />I had taken the LSD at noon and the MDMA at 1:30 and I was supposed to meet someone at 8 or so, so I started to the bus around 6:30. My flight back home being soon and intending to take some shroom chocolates home with me, I was uber-paranoid and didn&#039;t want to risk having the smell of my last pot edible in my pocket or being high when my plane left the next morning, so I broke the vacuum seal right there and stuffed the whole thing in my mouth. This was a &quot;double strength mulatto bar&quot; advertised as being extremely potent, and it indeed ended up leading to the most intense experience of my life--even more than 8 tabs of good 3jane&#039;s lsd or my crazy mushroom paralysis 2 days prior, as well as a Cheeba Chew quad dose I ate all at once a week before that.<br /><br />Anyway, I had totally come down from both the LSD and MDMA when I got on the bus at 7:00, but a good 15 minutes in I was definitely becoming extremely fucked up. I have almost no experience with smoking and only a little with edibles, but I could tell this wasn&#039;t the kind of pot high I was used to.<br /><br />The thing that stands out was this idea I started to have that &quot;concepts&quot; have &quot;icons&quot; or &quot;shapes&quot; in our mind that we use as shorthand to remember things without having to bother with language. I would think of &quot;getting into a car&quot; or &quot;a backpack&quot; or &quot;sleeping&quot;, and these weird gray symbols would appear in front of me and zoom toward me. I felt like I had somehow unlocked this psychological concept and I had opened access to this bank of gray symbols and I could call them forth at will. I remember that &quot;getting into a car&quot; was like a equilateral triangle with two dots on the left side (although I know this is all nonsense, it made sense at the time). Around this time I also got really blurred vision, coupled with this crazy effect where textures were peeling away from surfaces to reveal something else underneath, somewhat like in Silent Hill 5 or Downpour or the movies if you&#039;ve seen them.<br /><br />And then I began to very carefully watch the time, because although I knew what time the bus was scheduled to arrive at my stop, I was way too gone to figure out the street signs. I got off the bus at the correct time and the guy asked me if this was where I wanted to get off so I showed him my map. He told me it was wrong and explained that I needed to take some other bus (one of the few great things about my old home country is the almost anal predictability of the mass transit system), but it was way too confusing and I decided to just find a pay phone and get the people to come find me since I was in the general right neighborhood.<br /><br />But first I sat on a bench to give myself a chance to calm down, and that&#039;s when shit got real.<br /><br />I remember everything got really bright like broad daylight, and blurry and kind-of zoomed in too. It was almost like my visual input was broken up into a grid and each square zoomed in individually or something. And aurally, all the background noise suddenly got amped up by a factor of 10, becoming an overwhelming and insane cacophony.<br /><br />Next, my heart-rate and breathing got really fast and intense, and I thought I was having a heart attack and basically braced myself for my own mortal demise right then and there.<br /><br />And then, when things leveled off, I was in this kind of quasi-OBE state I have never experienced before. I didn&#039;t quite see my own body, but I felt like my field of view was wider, and I was looking down at someone else&#039;s arms. My breathing was still really heavy, and it occurred to me that I didn&#039;t really know who I was. I kept tracing steps back to re-identify myself, but it just as quickly as I grasped my identity it would slip away again.<br /><br />The stream of thoughts was something like, &quot;I&#039;m not from this town. I&#039;m not from this country even. I&#039;m from this other country. But how do I get back? How do I prove I&#039;m from my actual country and force them to let me back in? How can I get to the airport like this? I can&#039;t even remember my name.&quot;<br /><br />Next, my visuals changed from &quot;intense and focused&quot; to this kind of &quot;time bubble&quot; where the world was updating at like 1 frame per second, but rather than updating all at once, I would hear a &quot;whoosh&quot; and various parts of the scene would refresh independently across this horizontal plane centered around my position.<br /><br />And now I thought if I hadn&#039;t done myself in, I had unlocked some kind of latent schizophrenia and I&#039;d be lost forever. I was gone for good. Having worked extensively with mental patients, I knew what was coming. I pictured a life-time locked in this frozen state, occasionally pulled aside to be beaten by hillbilly orderlies.<br /><br />All in all this time on the bus bench was bar none the most intense, frightening, confusing, helpless, and all-around fucked-up experience in my entire life, on drugs or not.<br /><br />Now, I didn&#039;t know at the time how long this temporary psychosis had lasted--I would have guessed 10 minutes--but at some point the cyclically updating world gave way to the gray icons from before, which eventually led to just being &quot;regular high&quot; again, which was the most relieving feeling in the world even though I was keeping innocent people waiting for me for what I later confirmed to be almost 2 hours. I stumbled to the nearest store, hardly able to figure out the cross-walk lights, and after going to several places with no luck a lady asked me if I was okay, and when I asked if she knew where there were pay phones she offered to let me use the store&#039;s phone.<br /><br />The rest is inconsequential--even for a massive tl;dr like this--but suffice it to say some drug-intolerant people came to pick me up and then drove me back home after a truncated dinner, and I successfully got home with my shrooms.<br /><br />A week later, my cheeks have healed but I still don&#039;t feel quite right. My vision was blurred for a few days, and now I swear I have permanent &quot;LSD color vision&quot;--a distinct colorful and high-contrast perception of colors I always get when tripping, and as of today it&#039;s still there, although otherwise I don&#039;t feel too bad...<br /><br />So in conclusion, I&#039;m pretty new to drugs, but could thc really do that to me? Surely a barely noticeable dose of LSD 8 hours in couldn&#039;t have done it unless somehow unlocked by the pot... Or maybe something the MDMA was cut with?<br /><br />In any case I don&#039;t regret the experience as long as I&#039;m not permanently damaged, but it definitely did something to me. I haven&#039;t quite processed it yet but I don&#039;t think I&#039;m exactly the same person I was before I sat down on that bus bench.<br />

				Yeah, I love days like that...<br /><br />I think the biggest issue you had was around planning things out. My wife and I did a two day drug fest but it takes some planning to get all the drugs in at the right time. It really is surprisingly difficult to have a non Amph induced multi-day high. I suspect taking what amounts to an insane amount of shrooms to start things off is likely what left your brain a little off kilter for the rest of the adventure. Had you done an 8th or even a 1/2 you likely could have enjoyed the cid a few days later and pulled off a nice little candy flip. But you&#039;re brain was done used up.<br /><br />Honestly if you go the MDMA route again (personally my FAVORITE drug), I&#039;d take it on it&#039;s own with a friend. MDMA will make you feel great but the real beauty of the drug is with friends. It&#039;s like a telepathic link of emotional well being is created. When you take some cid before hand magical things can happen but I think it&#039;s best to go pure MDMA first with a friend to get a feel for what the drug is all about. Oh, and taking a little bit of magnesium before you drop the MDMA can help with chewing your face off.<br /><br />As far as the pot putting you into insane life for a bit that&#039;s pretty typical. You were still high on a lot of drugs when you ate the pot, you just weren&#039;t as high as you were on the shrooms from days earlier so your brain just decided to declare this new reality as normal. Pot potentates a lot of drugs effects so when you took it you didn&#039;t just get high off the pot but the cid and the MDMA and whatever bit of shroom madness was still lingering in you. It&#039;s pretty common for people to take some Cid and get high a few days later and still get some flashbacks.<br /><br />Fortunately a new reality will be established in short order and normally the lingering effects die down. Eat healthy, get outside and in the sun a bit. It really helps. <br /><br />Glad you had an adventure, sounds like there were some good times in there. Stay safe!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Thanks for the insight.<br /><br />Yeah, I read a lot more and realized that maybe pot can rev up the effects of other drugs.<br /><br />Makes me want to learn how to get pot locally to salvage weak LSD trips even if it is 40-60 bucks a gram and I&#039;m a novice in terms of how to smoke it.

				Yes the mushy dose was far too much to have planned on enjoying anything else in the following days. Most likely what happend on the bus after some weed, was the marijuana bringing you into an all out roll again. Its not unusual for some one to ingest a dose of MDMA, then 5+ hours later, when the individual is convinced they are back to reality and dead sober, smoking a joint or even taking a small hit from a bowl, will throw that MDMA right back in your face in short spurts. From sober, into a roll, back to sober.. and so on and so forth.

				Poor thing, you must live in hell!<br /><br />The deal with pot amping up a LSD trip, for me anyway, is that it amps up the visuals but doesn&#039;t really get you into that philosophers mindset that LSD can put one in where everything is meaningful, profound and beautiful.<br /><br />Personally I think just getting to converse with the alien spider beings was worth it since on a day to day basis most people really don&#039;t get to do that.<br /><br />Happy tripping though and get out of hell...

				Awesome, that confirms my experience then! I&#039;ll be extra careful with setting in the future if I have access to pot with psychedelics. I&#039;m so confident on L in public these days and I assumed I&#039;d be okay on an edible but I should have put more thought into the possibilities of the combination.<br /><br />Honestly having discovered SR and how interesting these experiences can be I might just have to flip my who life upside down and move to a foreign country where the laws aren&#039;t so strict.<br /><br />As for the spiders, I&#039;ll go ahead and copy and paste from my diary the full version to explain what I meant. It was more of an internal mantra than a conversation really.<br /><br />The Grandspider Babies and Me:<br /><br />So I had a chocolate bar that apparently contained something similar in actives to 1 oz of shrooms, but it was made from stones and not actual shrooms.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had bad experiences following dosage advice on other psychedelics and always having a weak first trip and then losing the magic chasing a stronger trip after that, so I went with 6/9ths of the bar, twice what the guy recommended. I melted it in warm water and squeezed 3 lemons in and let it sit for 15 minutes and then managed to down the<br />disgusting concoction.<br /><br />20 minutes: Weird thoughts started to creep in. The person in the mirror<br />seemed suspect to me and the hotel hall looked really, really long.<br /><br />30 minutes: The wood grain on the desk looked grotesque and alien. The<br />red carpet with a green grid of dots looked kinda expansive like an<br />endless pasture, and I started to feel a really heavy body load<br />(something I&#039;ve never experienced on my other drugs of choice).<br /><br />45 minutes: At this point my mouth is hanging open and my body feels<br />like dead weight. I can barely move, but I force myself to stand up.<br />On LSD I like unfocusing my eyes in the mirror and watching myself<br />melt. I try it here and notice the difference with the still subtle<br />visuals. Whereas acid always makes things melt I&#039;m now seeing<br />textures. Like a floral pattern on my face, or if I get too close it<br />looks like raw meat.<br /><br />Where it all went wrong: I decided to put on some headphones, and I<br />wanted to turn on this disco ball thing I had gotten, but it was so<br />hard to move. I shuffled slowly across the room like a zombie,<br />constantly reminding myself what I was trying to do. I finally got the<br />lights off and the disco ball plugged in, but before I could turn it<br />on I was distracted by how the white things in the room seemed to glow<br />like there was a black light and the world was in grayscale, which distracted me.<br /><br />Next I fell to my knees and crawled around in the dark for a while,<br />unable to stand. I remember biting a lot of stuff. Like chewing on<br />various cords and furniture. I couldn&#039;t really talk but I made noises<br />or slurred words like a drunken baby or something and it amused me.<br /><br />Now, in the dark, I saw a book I had purchased with a drawing of a<br />spider on it. Just about now &quot;She&#039;s Leaving Home&quot; was playing, and I<br />started talking to myself, something that would last the next 2 hours.<br />It went something like this:<br /><br />My spider is leaving home.<br /><br />Why is my spider leaving me?<br /><br />She has her babies.<br /><br />I want my spider and her grand baby spiders.<br /><br />I need the grandspider babies.<br /><br />I can now speak the English of the grandpider babies.<br /><br />I can now transcribe the gramblish of the gramscriber scrabies.<br /><br />Anyway, once I hit on &quot;grandspider babies&quot;, it was like this switch<br />went off and I just started repeating this mantra again and again<br />about how I could now speak and transcribe and ascribe and describe<br />and this and that about the message and English from the grandspider<br />babies, and I just lay on the floor for the next 2 hours chewing on<br />things and repeating this fucking mantra mixed in with gibberish and<br />slowing down and speeding up my voice (at least I think it was me<br />changing the speed of my voice--have to check the audio and video I<br />took later). And so eventually when I was able to move a little I<br />turned on the disco ball but I still kept saying it for another hour,<br />as well as e-mailing lots of friends to tell them about how I could<br />now scramble the scringlish of the granspider babies.<br /><br />And then I coughed up a piece of fuzz from the shit I had been chewing<br />on and pulled it out of my throat, and just like that, like a light<br />switch, I was me again and basically sober.<br /><br />So anyway, no visuals really, which was what I wanted but I think I<br />was just beyond visuals. I don&#039;t regret it but I think I took way too<br />much.
