				Hello all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a regular buyer on the Silk Road for a while now. But I&#039;ll skip the small talk and get to the point. Without getting into details, I just lost someone in my life that I really can&#039;t live without. Point being, I am ready to die and join them in whatever comes next. I&#039;d appreciate it if we could skip the usual &quot;don&#039;t commit suicide, things get better!&quot; posts. I am a libertarian as many of you are, so I hope you appreciate my right to end my life when I so choose. I really have nothing to live for at this point, and I truly feel prepared to die. <br /><br />The one problem is that I am scared of dying in fear or pain. I am hoping that you valuable members of the Silk Road community may have some good suggestions. Maybe there is a certain drug that is best to overdose on that will not hurt? Or some other painless way of death? If there is something I need to purchase, that is fine, money will not be an issue since I obviously won&#039;t be needing it anymore.<br /><br />Like I said, I&#039;d rather this not turn into a lecture about how I should keep on living. No one is dependent on me, and I have lost all hope since this person died, so I am content and have accepted my death. Thanks for any suggestions that come my way.

				... Yea, and if you are even remotely Christian suicide = automatic trip to hell, no chance for heaven no matter how good you have been. Christian or not, do you really think that person that would want you to kill yourself because of them, and then have your death affect those around you as well?<br />Just stick it out. I&#039;ve been through hell and back bud, I know what position you are in even if you don&#039;t think I know. Don&#039;t do it. <br /><br />Edit: PM me if you want help. Don&#039;t kill yourself just because of this.

				Shit man, there&#039;s so much to live for. For your sake, I hope you&#039;re at least attempting to remedy the situation and are removing yourself from the environment causing you this pain. Losing someone close to you shouldn&#039;t be a death sentence for yourself. <br /><br />I&#039;m very open to the idea of suicide, especially in cases of terminal illness. But this... seems like terrible justification for wanting to kill yourself. At the very least, it will have effects on family and acquaintances around you, whether you want to believe it or not. <br /><br />Enough &quot;small talk&quot; though, here&#039;s how you&#039;d want to do it: <br /><br />I disagree with the phenobarbital recommendation, as I&#039;m pretty sure its slow onset would make dying on it quite uncomfortable. Actual barbiturates are probably the &quot;A&quot; standard and basically what they use for lethal injections, but they&#039;re almost impossible to find nowadays.<br /><br />The Darvon Cocktail ingredients (Dextropropoxyphene combined with slow and fast-acting benzos)&nbsp; are all sold on the SR, and although a somewhat drawn-out process as well, it seems like a viable option: <br /><br />Antiemetic drugs must be taken beforehand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Dextropropoxyphene HCl (Darvon, Deprancol, Depronal): 3.5 grams<br />Midazolam (Dormicum): 300 mg<br />Diazepam (Valium):&nbsp; 300 mg<br />

				How can you guys be opposed to him killing himself, yet you guys tell him exactly how to do it? You guys shouldn&#039;t be telling him what kills him, even if it is his right to die. Yeah, even if you don&#039;t tell him, he&#039;ll find the information somewhere else or just settling down for the ol&#039; noose, but maybe not telling him could buy him some time to rethink it. You never know...<br /><br />It hurts me for someone to give up their life. Animals and people aren&#039;t wired to commit suicide, it&#039;s a disease, which means he can get better.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t do it, bro...<br /><br />I know it&#039;s your right to die, nobody is stopping, just trying to help. please try talking it over with somebody, first. Go see a docter or something dude.<br /><br />

				I am sorry for your loss and sorry that you are in so much pain, hope you can find a way out of the bad place where you are now ...<br /><br />But Festivalia is right, there is no guarantee you will see your friend again - no guarantee.<br /><br />You don&#039;t say how old you are or how much living you&#039;ve done.&nbsp; Are your parents still alive?&nbsp; What about siblings?&nbsp; If you check out, they will have to clean up the mess. And they will carry this burden forever.&nbsp; If your mother is still alive she will probably blame herself for your suicide.&nbsp; Have you thought about that at all?&nbsp; Do you want your family to pick up your pain and carry it around forever??&nbsp; <br /><br />I wish you well, friend and hope you can find another way back - the people here will help you if there is nobody you trust IRL ~&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />

				You know what pisses me off? All the retardery about &quot;Lol, hell... etc... life is worth living!&quot;<br /><br /><br />Look, if someone is wanting to off themselves, they will do it , period. Trying to reason with someone who feels this way is pointless.... sort of. I have no fucking idea what I am saying. And I cannot give any life-saving (Or death-giving) advice. All i can say is, like every other human animal on this shit-world, I feel ya. <br /><br /><br />OP, you mention a loved one. I will say this without preaching... live for them. Honor their life by living yours, no matter how much it hurts. You will have all eternity with them (All religious BULLSHIT aside here). Dude, you&#039;re part of the fucking universe. As was/is the person you lost. So, really, you didnt lose them. They just melted into the background. You&#039;ll see them. I mean, again without trying to sound all faggy here, they are not really &quot;gone&quot;. You just cant see them. Remember, universe. Energy cannot be destroyed, etc. Your love for this person, and theirs for you, will echo for all time. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />... I should really edit this. It probably sounds really stupid. But you know what? It&#039;s from the heart. <br /><br />There is no sense is trying to bring logic into the emotional state. <br /><br /><br />... or something.&nbsp; Man I really need to bowl pack. :/ <br /><br /><br />Edit: Solution - Loads of drugs, leap off a building. Splat.Quick. End. <br /><br />ALSO , what really confuses me is this, people want to die due to hurt. They want relief, but relief cannot be had if you&#039;re dead.&nbsp; Also, yeah... suicide... thought about it many of time. G.L.

				I would support a death that is completely and directly fueled by curiosity rather than sadness. <br /><br />Anyone anywhere can die at any moment. Life is so fragile yet we walk around with misguided notions that nothing randomly fatal will happen to us. We walk around constantly on a cusp-edge of the greatest mystery in Nature; death. I think the meaning of life is having a sense of Purpose, those who do not feel this have a void they will fill with activities, substances, relationships, careers, religions or anything that will give them a sense of being needed or reason they are living. The easiest of this is becoming a parent. I don&#039;t think there is a fear of death, but there is a fear of having to accept Purpose as an illusion. It might be through death that we really find the true Purpose of our lives. <br /><br />Or we may not. Could just be a dark dirt nap. <br /><br />TL;DR - Don&#039;t do it OP unless it is for science!<br /><br />

				Surprised no one has mentioned this yet but there is something called a helium hood that I looked into when I was thinking about ending it...Its quick and painless and there is no room for mistakes, ie; ending up braindead instead of dead. They are now illegal in US though. <br /><br />I would like to create an echo here and just say think more about it, the people who love you and care about you, think of them, suicide is an incredibly selfish act. <br /><br />&nbsp;Take care friend and here&#039;s to brighter days ahead if you can just hang in there.

I have lost a couple of people to suicide, though, with (in retrospect) a fairly clear view of what drove them to it, and also (knowing their siblings, their friends, today) having a pretty good idea of the life they had a shot at if they stuck around, and I will re-state what some others have said about this being a permanent solution to a - very, very likely - temporary problem. It&#039;s your pain. You decide when a better future, even if it were guaranteed, is no longer worth enduring the present. What I do want to emphasize, though, is that it is overwhelmingly likely that a happier future awaits you if you do decide to stick it out. It&#039;s up to you, but my hope is that you find it.

				Speaking as someone who doesn&#039;t value my own life much. You will die anyway. Nature will kill you so no need to do it yourself. Just wait and it will happen on it&#039;s own. In the mean time just do some drugs, party, do whatever the hell you want and just remember you will die anyway!!!

				YAY :D! He was drunk! Seriously though bro, I&#039;m really glad you&#039;re rethinking your decision. I&#039;ve had suicidal thoughts, life sucks i know, and I&#039;m very very sorry for your loss man. But hold on, go ahead do your drugs, live your life to the fullest. Just don&#039;t do anything rash.<br /><br />And doesn&#039;t MDMA cause depression afterwards for a couple of days? If so I&#039;d avoid it.

				Your fiancee would not have wanted you to die. I&#039;ve been very close to suicide, once after a breakup I took a shit ton of Xanax and tried to hang myself, but it REALLY FUCKING HURT, so I gave up and went to bed. I thank fucking God every day I didn&#039;t do that. To think of what it would have done to my family. And now 3 years later I&#039;ve met a much better woman. It&#039;s not possible to believe sometimes but shit WILL get better. You just have to get through it. Remember your first relationship in middle school or high school or whatever, where 2 weeks in you talk about getting married and having babies and shit? Then it turns out you totally jumped the gun and find out there are other, better women out there for you? Killing yourself over a fiancee is that short-sightedness to the ultimate extreme.<br /><br />Suicide is not only a selfish act, it&#039;s a bizarre one. You are in a twisted state of mind any time you contemplate suicide. You CAN live without her, it will take time but it will happen.<br /><br />I know you said not to lecture you in your OP, but tough shit. What do you think it means that damn near every poster on here did just that? It means you&#039;re not in your right state of mind. Don&#039;t do it, and you probably shouldn&#039;t be getting drunk right now. It&#039;ll make you do dumb shit (like send humiliating emails).

				I seriously know the feeling. But I think you should rethink about this in 1, maybe 2 years from now.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it is really possible to die from smoking dmt. You&#039;d trip and let the bong fall way before that, or get sick or something.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried it with a combination of heroin, coke, ghb, alcohol, xtc, speed, ketamine, valium. To get totally wasted and not feel any pain.<br />Ended up lying in bed, puking and shitting all over myself and not being able to stand up anymore. <br /><br />Result: well I don;t want to think about it, but probably some internal organs don&#039;t like me so much anymore after that. And it scarred many people for life.<br /><br />Not sure I agree with that our lives are not ours to take. I mean, who else does? And why would you live in ultra pain with no glow in the future anymore because of sickness?<br />And who sais that if you kill yourself, you&#039;d join them in any way? Maybe you&#039;ll just be reincarnated in a different setting, with the same problems. Because you didn&#039;t overcome it this time...?<br /><br />Get through this, be strong. Think about it again in a few years. I hope you can do that, and that you&#039;ll think differently by then.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />

				please read what I&#039;m about to say...<br />I think you should reconsider you options because there is a very big chance of not being able to see that person again after death.<br /><br />Your screen might just turn black and you will stop existing. You would feel better helping your fiance to live through the memories you have and recall.<br /><br />

				I know you said not to lecture but to talk and think about suicide in my opinion is just the flat out wrong decision.. In my life I have been close to two different people that have committed suicide, one was family and the other a friend. Suicide is just a short term fix for you that turns into a life long pain for your family and friends. Just think it over, but I 100% agree it is your choice. I hope you the best, this bowl pack is for OP. <br /><br />Hope you go to better places, and see familiar faces<br /><br />AyKay

				I&#039;ve felt like killing myself too op. Back in February I started feeling shitty, so from Feb-May I spent a lot of time researching suicide. As far as drugs go, Barbiturates are your best bet, followed by a darvon cocktail or lethal amount of some opiate. I&#039;ve also heard good things about the helium hood/tank. Look up Jerry Hunt if you go this route, he posted a very well put together documentary/how to before using it to take his own life. If you find yourself unable to procure any of the drugs/gas tank, there&#039;s the hibachi/barbecue method. Light a few small portable charcoal grills in a small room and seal it airtight. You&#039;ll drift off slowly to the ferryman as the oxygen slowly gets sucked out of the room and your brain/lungs fill with deadly but o

				&nbsp;I&#039;m only guessing (obviously) but I&#039;d imagine after your heart officially stops beating and you die, your mind will continue to function for about a minute... due to the remaining oxygen in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;Then you will start to get tunnel-vision as it slowly goes black.

Hibachi you have to take into account the size of the room, getting the air mix just right, etc. The only failsafe suicide method is to just kill (figuratively) the part of yourself that&#039;s depressed. If you&#039;re willing to put all the effort into planning your demise, take even 1/4 of that effort to just improve your life. I&#039;m not religious at all, but you only have one chance at life, and odds are killing yourself won&#039;t reunite you with your fiancee. If a single religion with an afterlife is right, you two will be in opposite places forever. Is that a risk you want to take, considering you&#039;re trying to see them again? Take a few weeks and then some to give yourself time to fully think this through. Go see The Hobbit when it comes out, there are hordes of deceased Tolkien fans that would gladly trade your life for theirs. Pick a release date for some book, movie, game, tv show, music album that&#039;s coming out in the near future and at least let yourself experience one more thing that might turn it around for you before you end it. There&#039;s a wealth of information out there if you can&#039;t be swayed to not bring about your demise, but everyone here is more than happy to help you talk it out and work through your issues if you decide you really just need some support and a non-judgemental place to vent.

				Not the recent films, those were excellent and overall Peter Jackson did as good a job he could, and most of his deviations from the book are at least coherent enough for those who don&#039;t know better especially. Have you ever seen the animated version of Fellowship/Two Towers? That scene between Gandalf and Sauron at Isengard made me question if someone had secretly slipped me lsd.

				The unfinished animated version (they ran out of budget) that was released very poorly onto VHS, I thought was excellent.&nbsp; It was a far cry from the boring hash that peter jackson made.<br />I give you that he could only do the best he had to work with, and the effects WERE amazing, he just decided to copy most of the books TO THE LETTER.&nbsp; And, let us be honest, reading the books are a fucking chore.<br />I tried twice over the past few years to read the trilogy and i always get stopped at the same place.<br />Where Gollum is slowly following the hobbits behind.<br />And if i recall i stopped at exactly the same page.<br />The animated version was superior in every way, action, voice acting especially casting John Hurt as Aragorn, that idea was just pure genius.

It&#039;s been a few days now so if you&#039;re out there Suicide give us some closure on this topic and tell us you thought about what the others said and decided not to do it. Otherwise we might think otherwise, and that would not be good. <br /><br />Lot of frankness on this thread RE peopl&#039;s experiences with suicide. Not going into MY life, but I&#039;m glad others did. Thumbs up. When I get to 100 I&#039;m going to come back to this thread and give every fucking one (nearly) +3 Karma.

Glad to hear some nice MDMA hit the spot, just remember that you may feel pretty shit after you come down. Don&#039;t get caught in a nasty spiral of drug use to feel good.

				I lost my partner and there were many days I came close to end my life. I want to reach out to you and tell you that I know it is really heartbreaking what you are going through. It is very important to take good care of yourself: cry when you need to cry, go back to bed and shut the world out when it is too much and if you would enjoy something; give it to yourself.&nbsp; Honour and remember your loved one in any way you like. Share and be honest with your friends. <br />For me, it did get better. I miss him every day, I was very blessed to have this wonderful love in my life and I know I am making him proud.

				You can keep j/o till you die. lol, j/k But i&#039;ve actually heard of someone dying that way.<br />But seriously, Dude. I&#039;ve been in your shoes before. I lost my best friend about 7 years ago. We did everything together. she was my best friend since i was 13 so it took a heavy toll on me. I imagined my life alone and wanted out. I tried twice and the second time i was rushed to the ER. I can honestly say, altough this is really not the best advice, but the only thing that got me through that was discovering heroin. It had a sort of anti-depressant effect on me. It helped numb the pain and i was able to tolerate the loneliness. at this point i was drinking every day and swallowing any drug i could. I Was smoking a lot of crack and drinking. Someone offered me heroin, i said, &quot;sure, why not&quot;. And little by little, I kept going back to it because i thought, &quot;hey, i&#039;m gonna die anyways, so i might as well get addicted to heroin.:&quot;<br />But it became something that made me want to walk around while high, talk to people. I started hanging out with my other friends. and the pain lifted. little by little, but it went away. also i was going down this downward spiral because 3 years before that, i was drugged and raped for 2 days in a hotel room. i felt shame, i felt like people thought i wanted it. i felt no one believed me and no one would believe me because i was such a drug addict. it took such strength to pull myself out of that. and now, almost 10 years later. I&#039;m still recovering. I&#039;m now on methadone and i can honestly say, recreational drug use was what helped me through some of the darkest times in my life i think. I wouldn&#039;t really just tell people to start doing drugs if you&#039;re suicidal. but i&#039;m just sharing that i was once in a place where you are and i was able to pull out of that. I also thought about the people who loved me. how hurt they would be if i did it. though i must tell you, at the time i was such a mess that i thought no one really loved me. i was such a drunken asshole. always stealing for drugs and alcohol. but later i found out that i had a few people that loved me. so really, just try to forget about it for a while. maybe do some K or smoke some weed everyday. take some pain killers. do something that will give you euphoria. or do yoga or have a lot of sex. do something that little by little, you&#039;ll start to think, &quot;i can get through this. I Want to live.&quot;<br />I hope this helped. If you&#039;re religious, pray. read books on depression, loneliness, pain.&nbsp; or funny books, watch a lot of comedy movies. <br />I&#039;m sorry you&#039;re going through such a hard time. If you want to talk to someone, you can email me, Beefy@tormail.org

				It&#039;s probably too late after 10 years but I hope this sob or sobs get/s caught, hauled to jail and systematically sodomised on a daily basis. And if you have to drug somebody first in order to do this, because you don&#039;t want to risk a fight, you must be weak as sh*t. It really annoys me when I hear of these things happening. I hope you doing okay. <br /><br />Like typtap said though, the OP has chilled out thanks to some MDMA (from memory), and the urge for suicide is hopefully gone forever. Haven&#039;t heard from him lately, but assume (hope) he&#039;s doing okay out here. btw, took me a week to realise Festivalia wasn&#039;t bin Laden.(His pic.)<br />

				Trust me...it&#039;ll all be better eventually. As for suicide...I always figured I&#039;d just OD on heroin... or drown myself... But those days are usually long gone. It&#039;s been a 20 year struggle.

				What a crock of shit<br />You obviously want to talk it out and get support otherwise you would not have posted anything. <br />The ones that do , do it and are found the next day. They don&#039;t post stuff like you<br />I think suicide&nbsp; is fucking selfish and for the weak minded who cannot see another way out of their situation or feelings (the terminally ill don&#039;t fall into this section). People need to find a way of coping that suits that individual<br />No life taken was a life worth keeping. <br />It&#039;s the loved ones that are left behind i feel for. not the turds who flush the gift of life away<br />Peace and happiness to all

				The best and worse job I had was counselling children who has attempted to commit suicide.<br /><br />It was a job that changed my perception of life and one which eventually I had to take a break from as you cannoy help but get emotionally involved.<br /><br />Sadly, the internet now means the kids I might have conselled (all of which recovered, some famously so) will be too wise as the mechanics of suicide and although I have done breavement counselling, that was nothing really, its easy as its something everyone usually goes through unless they die young.<br /><br />The people who sell suicide kits online, are scum.<br /><br />People who woul;d give advise on the besy ways, I&#039;d ban from this site. Drugs are a celebration of life! For some of us - its the special weekend, and soon its Christmas when suicidal people feel bad because they see the happiness and wish they had some.<br /><br />I have been there myself. But the thing is to never give in. Suicide has nothing to do with what you have. A person may have someone who they love and who loves them - they may have money, a nice car, decent savings and a job that will always be there. <br /><br />Mostly its lonliness. Children find it easy to convey this, adults usually always hide or feel shame over it.<br /><br />Anyway, the internet allows those with depression to converse with each other. I advise joining a &#039;pro-life&#039; site - not a religious happy clappy one - just a site that makes clear its for support and not for people to get advice on carbom monoxide poisoning, which, I might add, can leave you a very much alive but slurred speech, wheel-chair bound, nurse changing the nappy type of person.<br /><br />Best way to die is to live long enough. It will happen, 100% guarentee. So, right now, you can live and I know one thing, people find their feet in their own time. Suicide is not a cowards way but unless your facing horades of Afghani insurgents and have one bullet lieft, it is not a good way to go, leave little inspiration for the mourners and a suiicide, is usuallly a shit after party. Who would take mdma at a after funeral party from a guy who hung himself? <br /><br />So please, if your down, forget the assholes here, join a forum that is dedicated to help but bear in mind that you got to help others to get help. Its give and take.<br /><br />I&#039;m not supposed to keep in touch with the children I have helped, but the parents keep in touch till the children are 18. <br /><br />Adults are a lot harder. Many paid me basically to just talk. I advised all to go to a pub twice a week. Quiz night (drink little) and Friday or Saturday might when you can drink a few. I would NEVER advise anyone took any anti Ds but concede that for some, they worked, and made that mood swing to the positive.<br /><br />Cognitive Behavioral Therapy was maybe the best new school of thought in counselling.<br /><br />Almost everyone feels like suicide at some point in life. Talking about it helps. In fact, its keeping it in which pushed people to come to a conclusion that the world would be better off without them. Well, some guy, some girl, kills themselves, someone they would have met, now meets nobody or the wrong person and the world changes, just because of one person who thought they did not matter.<br /><br />We all matter.<br /><br />And if your feeling depressed right now, be careful with the drugs - don&#039;t use them to combat depression, and beware the stimulants which do take away depression vut have a payback price healthwise and youre mind also.<br /><br />I would offer free counsellling but I do not do that as so many year in the field, the emotuional commitment exhausted me. Its a career that I will return to but right now I&#039;m writing this and getting paid plus meeting somne guy later on who I buy a meal for and maybe get him some drugs! If he wants, I been told, the guys rock and rolls and is a great client. So got a stash of C, E, vals, Dex, lsd, 2 crates (24) of lager and one of bitter and 24 bottles of bud plus vodjka, whiskey, rum, brandy and gin. And smokewise? We got bud of the finest heritage, oil of a delectable disposition and hash which is just a delight and pure 100% UK, No1, 2 and 3 plus some N0 3 with oil in it so it looks like charas.<br /><br />Also, the surprise one, we got some shrroms off a good friend who has one of those kits and who uses spore collectedt to create a mini mushroom factory! Many edible but many exotic ones that get you high as a kite. <br /><br />So, knowing my luck he likes heroin!&nbsp; That is one drug I really have nothing to do with. Cannot justify selling it or getting it as a favour. My boss agree and thinks a client on heroin is a risk. We so work on a buy now pay later scheme. so you can see the concern!<br /><br />Anyway, suicide,its an option, but&nbsp; so is life, plus life is far more interesting.<br /><br />At one time my life was fuck all. Homless. Not a penny. <br /><br />Depression, its just something you have to find the right strategy to deal with!!!!<br /><br />Like if you have a bad leg, you compensate to make walking better.<br /><br />With depression, you have life to compensate with. Its what you do that puts you in a mood, be it good or bad.<br /><br />Also the people youj are with.<br /><br />If you want to know who is really a friend, tell them you have depression. If they listen, and call nest day, youknow they ARE a real friend!<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />We will find a cure soon anyways.<br /><br />Its DNA they say so do not worry because your worry is just DNA kicking in! <br /><br />If your really fucked up ask the doc for Valium. At least that worked in cases of real depression. Now its all P:rozac and other shit. Thing is no anti deppression drug is sold by dealers apart from dizaepam, Valium by Roche!<br /><br />Besy way to defeat depression is accept it, research it, but do more because anyone with a tendency to get depression will be no good with boredom!!<br /><br />Have hobbies, read a lot, or find someone to love.<br /><br />NEVER just think your nothing. That is self pity bullshit. Someone, out there, would be so grateful to have you as a friend! <br /><br />And if you have been bullied - fuck those bullies - life will eat them up - let it - you were hurt but your stronger for it and might be able to help kids whose suicide fixation is often low self esteeem nurtured by bullying.<br /><br />Good luck out there.<br /><br />Any bullies want to bully someone bully me!<br /><br />I&#039;ll have you on the flloor in 10 seconds.<br /><br />Crying in 30 seconds.<br /><br />I&#039;d be a cat, you the mouse!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Miiooowwww!<br /><br />puuurrrrr.<br /><br />Be strong!<br /><br />NEVER keep depression to yourself.<br /><br />And if your here to think this is funny - fuck you asshole - I&#039;d kick your ass but sadly we are unable to meet for a fight which I know I&#039;d win because Red is pretty much trained in lot of shit that means even the 6 foot 7 monster is easy really. No, I never use weapons. But have used them when people produce them and I confiscate the weapon and use it on the perp! Been doing boxing since 8 and martial arts when 4. I always advised bullied kids to do martial arts and my advise came from way way back. <br /><br />And, if you think your not looking so great, check out the models who all look like they do at least 2 grams of No 1 heroin plus take 3 grams of crack for a nightcap. They look like death warmed up!<br /><br />Depression, suicide, all of that, its a touchy subject but best be honest and inform people we all have tendancy to want to die sometimes life is mostly 99% graft and 1% joy.<br /><br />Its the 1% that matters. The shit we take to get there, is just life happening.<br /><br />Anyhow, my own counselling is a ramdom stranger at a bar when I drink seven pints of beer and a few chasers.<br /><br />With coke, it would hotel room, hooker and even watch TV, now its the missus and she hogs the coke and worse, does not want wierd sex on coke! Damn! Maybe I should avoid getting her my usual present! Or just accept she won&#039;t dress up like a vampire and let Red corner the vampire and do the undead from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />The meaningf of life? Easy.<br /><br />Its in the living of it you find meaning.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />You&#039;ll be ok - just don&#039;r keep this shit to yourself or Red will get you!<br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Well not right now, got this oil see, and am sprawled on the sofa, am becoming &#039;as one&#039; with the sofa.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				Please don&#039;t&#039; top your self. Might as well just stay comfortable and enjoy bits of life as you can every now and then.<br /><br />Carbon monoxide bottled gas is meant to be good as it knocks you out then asphyxiates you.<br />The danger is though that you will be too dead to turn off the canister of CO and it will seep into the flat below killing the occupants of that flat.<br />Or someone who finds your body will not realize that they are standing in a deadly atmosphere and pass out and die.<br /><br />So it would not just be yourself that you are hurting. You would be potentially murdering others too.<br /><br />And CO is a greenhouse gas I think. Think of the environment and think of all the children&#039;s futures too.
