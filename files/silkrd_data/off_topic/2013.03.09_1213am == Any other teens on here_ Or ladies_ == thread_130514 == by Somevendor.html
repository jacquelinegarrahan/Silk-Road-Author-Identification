				Being a sixteen year old girl I feel that I am representative of a minority... Anybody else like me on here? SR seems like it would be a dream come true for all the minors who have figured out how to access it. Reduced legal penalties and flexible hours combined with easy access to drugs/customers from peers makes for a promising source of pocket money. Especially considering the alternative is working long hours performing menial tasks under a dictatorial boss for minimum wage. Vending on here has been an incredible experience for me.

				Not really sure there would be any reduced legal penalties for a vendor regardless of their age, as it would still be large scale drug trafficking. For a buyer, there is the risk of parents (if they care) and the vagaries of school politics (an ex friend who rats you out). <br /><br />But you pose a good question, exactly how many people on here are under 18? How do they handle the increased oversight of their lives compared to someone who is living on their own? Most of the teens I know of would not last a day after discovering SR, and I hope they never do. Or at least that they mature quite a bit first. But I can definitely agree that if it were not for the risk of legal action, making money off of here would easily beat a part time job.

				I am usually against any information that could even give any clue about who I am period even as far as age but that being said, I&#039;m not a minor but I have been wondering this too, especially reading the posts in some threads I know that there must be children among us. I know adults aren&#039;t the only ones that know about SR. Don&#039;t mean to change the subject but it just kind of worries me, I know there are responsible minors as I feel as if I was one but I don&#039;t know I just hope SR just doesn&#039;t attract the wrong attention especially from minors that end up getting caught or just any more media attention in general, I just hope the place can remain as low profile for as long as possible.

				I don&#039;t think people under 18 should be browsing SR or any other black market website for that matter, let alone being a vendor. Soon enough your parents will probably see the large quantities of their painkillers are going missing.

				Unless I were tried as an adult the penalties would be less severe. I haven&#039;t really looked into it as much as I ought to though, and I&#039;m certainly not counting on reduced penalties as a justification for carelessness. Also, I agree that buying would be challenging to anyone still living with parents or even with room mates. I heard a story in the news a while back about two Australian brothers having LSD imported with SR and then distributing it to kids at their school. They were caught because their mother reported odd packages and then police did a controlled delivery. I would think the most frequent reason for anyone to be caught is telling people they knew in real life about their activities, but even then the risks would not be any greater than those involved in regular drug dealing.

				I remember when I was 16 my dad found a 1/4lb of my pot. He very quickly called the cops on me. (I know, asshole right?)<br />It may seem unlikely, but consider this: Your parent finds out what you are doing, then later you are busted EVEN IF the parent doesn&#039;t turn you in, but the parent knows about SR. what happens if they take over your account? You won&#039;t give up your password, you say? OK, then you&#039;re going to serve the next 2 years in a juvenile facility and the next 8 after that in a prison. You&#039;d give up your account in a heartbeat, you&#039;d have an order inbox full of people&#039;s addresses, people who count on you to maintain their privacy!<br />. The moral of this story is, if you&#039;re not in control of your surroundings, and you&#039;re vending, you&#039;re putting everyone you sell to at risk, not to mention yourself, which is least of all if you&#039;re any sort of responsible person.

				A lot of people here are talking about the risks to your personal freedom here, and don&#039;t get me wrong, it is ultimately your choice if you decide to vend on Silkroad, and put yourself at risk by doing so. I&#039;d like to focus on something else.<br /><br /><br />If you were caught, god forbid, selling any illegal substance via the road your parents/guardians would be in as much, if not a little more shit than you. As a 16 year old, you would likely receive a less harsher prosecution (depending on your location), but your carers house would be searched, and they would be charged for any illegal substances found there. Also, it&#039;s a very real possibility that social services would get involved, and you, as well as any siblings you have would be separated from their care.<br /><br />I think that if you choose to have fun with drugs that is your choice, why shouldn&#039;t you? If you want to sell narcotics, sure why not, as long as you&#039;re careful, but I&#039;m not sure I could personally handle the guild of putting my family at risk just for a little easy money. Just my 2c.

				My 2 cents:<br />16 is not old enough to deal drugs. Children (and you are classified as a child in most countries) should not be dealing drugs. Sure, smoke a joint at a party, drink some liquor and throw up. But know this: the penalties of getting caught dealing affect not only you but your legal guardian(s). I&#039;m sorry if this appears condescending, maybe you&#039;re the exception to the rule, just wait a few years and then do whatever you want. Consider it an exercise in discipline or restraint - you&#039;ll come out of it for the better.

				I&#039;m not anyone to judge but I think 16 is way to young to be in a place like this. Just because you&#039;re behind a screen. The risks are still very real. Regardless enjoy your time here and try not to put anyone else at risk with you!

				Good on you for being this &#039;entrepreneurial&#039; at such a young age.... I don&#039;t see anything wrong with a minor selling drugs on the road, as it happens all the time in real life anyway (from hard core ghetto dealers to kids selling their ritalin). So long as you don&#039;t treat it like a game I have nothing but respect for you. Just out of curiosity tho, what can a 16yr old get cheap enough to resell on the road?

				Ehhhh... This thread worries me. I am not totally against minors being on the road but being a vendor is another thing. These are some big time charges here. Given that you will be tried as a minor it will stick with you for life if caught. I have to agree with the others I think that 16 might be a tad bit young. I think it would take at least the mind span of a 18 yr old or above&nbsp; (a smart one at that) to be able to properly function on the road. <br /><br />The thing is....<br />Everyone can travel the road, everyone can use it, but not everyone can do this with both anonymity and success.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a lot of room for error in this place in so many ways, but in the same sense there are only several scenarios that can go right!

				if you are caught, you will be considered an adult during your trial. drug trafficking is not a small offense.<br /><br />I know some people care if minors are taking drugs... but why the fuck should you?<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to allow myself to feel shit because some 15 year old kid tripped balls off LSD and proceeded to kill himself... nor will I give a shit if I hear of some 12 year old meth addict.<br /><br />If you have the intelligence to buy from silkroad... you should have the intelligence to stay the fuck away from drugs till your brain is well developed.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t even drink alcohol till I was 18.. but I was junking off caffeine like no tomorrow and that allowed me to be depressed as fuck during my teenage years.<br />

				I would suggest never giving out any types of identifying information regardless of being a buyer or a seller. I am not surprised this thread was started by a minor, but don&#039;t admit anything like age, gender, or location to ANYONE. Only stupid people think law enforcement doesn&#039;t keep track of this information. Everything you put online, and ESPECIALLY here is logged by LEO in one manner or another whether it be active or passively taken. Even using misinformation starts to target you as they can start poking holes into your real identity by correlating all the info given and finding out patterns or by knocking out fake info via contradicting lies. It is always best to not give any info if possible.

				As an anonymous marketplace, and the world&#039;s most effective free market, I think arbitrary membership guidelines might be a bit hypocritical.<br /><br />I agree, young users may fine access to dangerous drugs, or their actions may cause unnecessary risk for us or for themselves - but the same can be said of any irresponsible 20-something, especially if they aren&#039;t in control of their drug use.<br /><br />Part of the anonymity is revealing nothing about yourself - I&#039;m sure plenty of &quot;minors&quot; (an arbitrary label prescribed by the government, eh?) use the road responsibly, and I&#039;m sure a plenty get picked on by scammers and the like due to inexperience, but on SR your learn fast or have a short-lived career.<br /><br />So, someone posting on the forums that they&#039;re 16 may worry us, but I think it&#039;s only worrying that they would come forward and say this, because it suggests a certain lack of caution / paranoia about your identity online.<br />Hell, this could be a troll. &quot;Haha I&#039;ll go tell the SR forums I&#039;m a 16y/o girl who vends on the road,&quot; and we&#039;ll all take it completely seriously.<br /><br />So. In all.<br />Discriminating by age isn&#039;t what the road is about, but judging someone by their actions, especially if related to age, is fair because it affects their viability as a good member of SR.

				first i want to say that you are very naive. You don&#039;t have enough life experience to deal properly. Yet. Even if everything seems fine. <br />You will fuck up!<br />You will get busted!<br />Your brain is still developing. I know how this shit feels. I was pretty much retarded back in the teen days. I still am but kinda differently.<br />The confusion goes away. <br /><br />Your post here is a cry for attention. you are not doing things right. You are like i was. <br /><br />When i was your age i remember i had a strange urge to get busted. i wanted people to&nbsp; see me as that cool druggie guy.... <br />experimenting how&nbsp; my parents react to drug use. Experimenting and observing how LEO works. <br />Learning how to use drugs. How to dose. Whats shit does what. How i react. How my friends react. How real life dealers act. How they sell. How paranoid they are. How they react to LEO. .&nbsp; I experimented.. and pushed myself into psychosis and i poisoned myself and&nbsp; i violated myself and i disrespected myself and the drugs and the people. <br /><br />If you really want to keep dealing and there is no way for you to change your mind ( a dealer should always be ready to change and abandon) then i think you should sell low amounts, in real life and&nbsp; weed only . No powders, No Crystals, No blotters, No pills nothing too dangerous you can od with or fuck yourself up for life.<br /><br />Learn how to be paranoid safely. Train yourself for conflict. With LEO and with Criminals. <br /><br />If word gets out that you are holding the chance of getting robbed will increase! You could get beat up or raped on the streets if you mix with the wrong crowd. Be careful who you sell to or buy from.&nbsp; Be careful with narcs. Be careful with everyone. No one is really your friend. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think its wise for you to vend drugs up here.&nbsp; <br />But&nbsp; i bet a lot of dudes would buy used clothing. (you know: underwear) Not me of course I&#039;m not that kinda creep but i bet you could make some nice money with it! and no conflict with LEO!!<br /><br />well that&#039;s about it. <br /><br />Can you post link to your vendor account? I want to take a look at your profile.
