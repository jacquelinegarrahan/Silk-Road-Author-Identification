				Also had this feeling a few times.<br />&quot;99% makes it&#039; but IT SEEMS LIKE I&#039;M ON THAT 1% THAT ALWAYS SUCK.&quot;<br /><br />But you need to understand a few things when you order on SR:<br /><br />1 Need to do a good research regarding the vendors your buying from before you buy.<br />2 This might be hard to believe but when you order drugs on the mail, internationally,&nbsp; shit happens, a alot of it.<br /><br /><br />but mostly number 1,&nbsp; do this point right and you will be happy on your next try,&nbsp; remember not to FE&nbsp; so if nothing comes you can at least claim your loss back.

				I took my time in looking through sellers feedback &amp; forum references before ordering. Not gonna blame them namely here. One is very popular lsd seller, another one had nice 25i-nbome on sale. FE for both.. they are &#039;trusted&#039;, and I have &#039;not enough transactions&#039;.<br />I did not trash any letters with drugs &#039;cause all the spam is fucking coupons from local supermarkets.<br />I used my real name and real address.<br /><br />Either I&#039;m just a complete loser or SR is a biggest fraud project I even believed in...:))))

				There are plenty of other vendors out there that will not require FE -&nbsp; i would recommend using them<br />For some reason 99% of the cases related to being the &quot;1%&quot; that did not arrive is linked to FE....&nbsp; :)

				Hahaha. First two posts... awesome. <br /><br />Yeah, FE can mean hard times. That&#039;s why there are thread after thread telling you not too. But what if your DOC isn&#039;t sold by anyone who takes noobs in escrow? Well then you&#039;re either SOL or you have to roll the dice. Or you could buy some drugs you always wanted to try if they are sold by vendors who accept noobs in escrow.

				These are my stats as of today Januarty 6th<br /><br />Total transactions: 41<br />Total spent: $12322.23<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 4.36%<br />Member for: 2 months<br /><br />When you first start in SR you have to take a Leap of Faith, you dont know if your product will be good or if the vendor will actually ship your drugs. You have to take a leap of faith, its like when you buy street drugs and you dont know the dealer that well, or if his products are as what he advertises, we had to go through those who at a young age started getting drugs from street dealers.<br />Lucky for me on SR i have never been scammed, I only went to resolution center twice so far, but just to extend due dates because of christmas delays.<br />When i first started,&nbsp; lucky for me i found trusted vendors who i had to FE with, none of them scammed me. There was only 1 order that it never got to me 1g of MDMA, but that was when i first started 2 months ago, and i was like a kid with a new toy with SR, so i ordered a lot of shit from different vendors and sometimes the same stuff, so i got some MDMA, but there was only one package missing of MDMA but i will never know whose package was, because they all were from the same country , haha.<br />Nowdays, im not required to FE by most vendors and we remain in ESCROW , and i even FE sometimes with my favourite vendors even though im not required to do so.<br />My tips for SR are:<br /><br />1. Always stay in ESCROW whenever possible.<br />2. If you find quality vendors STICK with them, you dont want to use a new vendors whose stealth packaging methods are not known for you, they can fuck up bigtime and flag your address forever. Which could lead to packages not arriving to you from your quality vendors!<br />3. Dont trust ANY of the bitcoins threads that have been around the forums lately, because they are all scammers.<br /><br /><br />What do you want to buy? Maybe we can recommend you trusted vendors, also always use your real name and address.

				OP I have received 4 out of 4 orders. Only time I got scammed is when I FE&#039;d for a new vender, I received something, but it was not LSD. <br />Find a reputable vender and they should not require you to FE, they have enough capital where they can wait a few days for you to release the coins.<br /><br />Greenturtle

				Couple rules i picked up using SR<br /><br /><br />1. ALWAYS read forums upon forums of feedback before you chose any vendor<br /><br />2. ALWAYS use PGP encryption<br /><br />3. ALWAYS check and recheck and RE CHECK your address before you send<br /><br />4. ALWAYS be courteous and kind to your drug dealers as they are people to<br /><br />5. NEVER FINALIZE EARLY<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever been screwed over once...and it was the big Tony76 scam of last year...that was when i learned that i would never finalize early again.<br /><br />Keep hope brother this community works, just have to weed out the bad ones.&nbsp; 8)

Send them a message before placing an order to make sure you can stay in escrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t blame people for the fact that you did not do your due diligence and research how SR works.&nbsp; It is only confusing to you because you didn&#039;t do any research at all. If you were scammed then yes, you have a right to be angry at the vendor for scamming you, but accept that you should have read through the SR wiki and the forums before diving in and placing an order.&nbsp; There are threads for newbies here, they are pinned at the top of the main sub forum here.<br /><br />The people who put FE early for trusted vendor are Finalizing because they trust the vendor and want to FE as a thank you to a vendor they have done business with in the past.&nbsp; It is pretty straightforward, but I think you are over thinking it,&nbsp;

				I was a new buyer and I don&#039;t remember having to Finalize early for the&nbsp; vendors I purchased from at first. I think I messaged them and kept a conversation going and let them know who I was on the forums and that I wasn&#039;t planning on going anywhere and scamming them.<br /><br />International orders are my least favorite. I ordered GHB from BlueGiraffe and it took so long to get here, over a month....I thought it was picked up by LE for sure. It wasn&#039;t the vendors fault at all....it&#039;s just a long distance.

				my 2c...<br />BMR - you probably getting scammed, stay away<br />in SR find a vendor selling product you want, check on their review thread and forums to see what they and other members are saying, and also check their reviews and customer feedback. Once you are confident enough with a vendor, place an order, making sure your postal details are correct and the vendor sends to your area, and that you choose the correct postage option if there is one.<br />Never finalize early. If a vendor should never ask you to do this if they are a half decent vendor. When they ask you to to this then you know you got problems<br />Dont spend money you cant afford to lose

				@tdk: you may order the smallest size from me of either one of our two products (GHB powder and 5-MeO-MIPT capsules) and you may do the whole transaction in escrow despite your new buyer status. We also have a 100% re-ship guarantee if for some reason you do not get your order. So this will be a guaranteed positive experience for you.<br /><br />Not sure if these drugs are your cup of tea, but there you have it...<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

				50 days now.. nothing arrived so far.<br />Guys n girls, you tell me mostly what I&#039;m already aware of. I told you why I FE despite millions &#039;always stay in escrow&#039; advices around the forum. I also did my homework to check if sellers are legit - as far as it&#039;s possible - in SR feedback &amp; forum reviews. <br />Must admit Avengers marked that lsd one as a BAD vendor but just because its questionable quality and communication. And I&#039;m still not sure if I can trust Avengers.. they could be a paid bastards that never test anything actually.<br /><br />You should understand why I&#039;m whining here. I spend about fucking 500$ totally here and everything I&#039;ve got is one arrest and two frauds. It feels like shit.
