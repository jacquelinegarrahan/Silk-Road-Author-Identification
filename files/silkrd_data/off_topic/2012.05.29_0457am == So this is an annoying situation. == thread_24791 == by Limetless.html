				Yeah sure, I did it the other night and it was awesome. <br /><br />You make canni-butter so the ganj doesnt frazzle whilst cooking. You whack some olive oil in a pan (preferably extra virgin) and add some spring onion and normal onion and let them soften whilst adding a little salt and pepper, basil, oregano and garlic. You let that lot all soften so you have the flavour base. Then you chop some peppers (green and red) and add them in with some sundried tomatoes and let those soften nice and slow. Once they have sweated you take your meat (will go into this later) and add that in and allow that to cook. Finally you take your tinned diced tomatoes and add that on top and allow it all to cook nicely. You should add more seasoning after you add your meat and then again when you add your tinned toms. All this should be slow cooked on a low heat.<br /><br />For the meat for this recipe I recommend you either do meatballs or or either diced chicken or lamb. If you do meatballs you do that shit home-made and you do it properly they gotta be all beef and onion. Anyone who buys them shop bought or puts rusk/bread in them can get the FUCK out. To make meatballs you should get your mince made from steak and add onions to the mix and some chilies with the seeds and roll them into either big or little balls (I prefer medium to big) and baste them a little to make them stick. You should of course season your meat with salt and pepper as well. You should sear the meat in a separate pan and then put it in to the pasta sauce and then slow cook it to finish.<br /><br />Oh and the best pasta to use is either penne, fusilli, ditalini or conchiglie. Don&#039;t bother with the string/rippon pastas because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that kind of dish because the sauce is quite chunky. If you have to have a long pasta then go with tagliatelle.<br /><br />To go with it you should knock up a salad with lambs tongue lettuce, buffalo mozzarella, strawberries, apple, spring onion and black olives drizzled with olive oil and maybe a little bit of dressing. Also bake up some ciabattas but DON&#039;T fucking butter them like a pleb, you need to dip that goodness in olive oil and vinaigrette. <br /><br />Get&#039;s you mashed and it&#039;s lush.

				If you do this I suggest making 2 lots, because after eating the one with the herb you will get the munchies and want more. If you dont have some herb free pasta there you will get stuck in a sort of catch 22 situation.

				I may have to post my chocolate biscuit recipe too... The cannabutter extraction i used, (and this made 10 slices of choco-biscuity goodness) was 7 grams of (found leaves! Yup, just some trim I stumbled across!) 100 grams of butter put it in a pan, stew up for 1 to 2 hours, (smells a lot) add a bit of boiling water to it to stop it burning, and then just before the end, but about 50 to 100ml in... Run it through a kitchen sieve, making sure all the water/butter is out put it in a glass bowl, stick it in the fridge for a couple of hours, then tip the water away, your left with beautiful green butter, that can be cooked with, or added to cakes, pasta, spread on toast!! (You can even freeze it!)<br /><br />:)<br />

I never samples Tet&#039;s stuff, never actually heard of him till you mentioned him. However I have had 95% pure Bing that was done from an extraction and then acetone washed and Dutches is the only product I&#039;ve had that really comes close. I tested his stuff as well the first time I got it and the purity was as stated. Never bothered looking for anyone else since. :)<br /><br />I have got 4 of SuperTrips&#039; speakers, about 2g of K and 2g of Duchaan&#039;s Bing. Just ordered 2g of MD from Ivory too. Gotta keep it stocked. I can&#039;t wait to get my next batch of Meph in though, been out of stock for too long and missed that shit. :P<br /><br />

				Ceramic?? Man I&#039;d be scared of using them in case I dropped them. I&#039;ve got a set of globals. Well expensive but could skin a whole rhino in about 20 seconds! If you wanted to of course...
