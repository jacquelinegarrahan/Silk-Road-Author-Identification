				What website has the most comprehensive list of instrumentals &amp; acapellas (paid or free)?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, is the music industry leaving money on the table by not readily offering instrumentals &amp; acapellas for all songs?&nbsp; I think so because it&#039;s easier for the average joe to make music now than ever before given how far technology has come. (Check out this vid of Jamie Lidell who makes an entire song from his iphone using Maschine:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h2-1zD2pJA&amp;feature=player_embedded)&nbsp; <br /><br />And I think there would be a lot of demand for them.. from big name remix artists to the dude who just wants to drift off while vibing to the instrumental &quot;Cocaina&quot; by Busta Rhymes&nbsp; Imagine a site where you could get any instrumental or acapella for every song that was released in the past 30 years. I would gladly pay $10 dollars per track or even $20+ for certain classics.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your thoughts?

				You could download torrents of acapellas, but they won&#039;t be the most recent releases.. &quot;Isohunt.com&quot;<br /><br />or<br /><br />A good site for all things music production wise, plugins, samples, guides, acapellas, etc. is:<br />&quot;forum.audionews.org&quot;, you will need an invite or wait until the free sign up window though...<br /><br />or<br /><br />There is a trick, you may need a little bit of audio editing knowledge (Search engines WILL provide this..);<br />&nbsp;Two copies of the track in question are required, one of the original (With Lyrics) and one instrumental (Without lyrics).<br />&nbsp;and access to an audio editor (again, torrent sites are your friend here) then you can make your own acapella&#039;s...<br /><br />You load both of your audio files into the audio editor, making sure to line them up so they are PERFECTLY in sync, then highlight/select all of the instrumental track and reverse the phase of it, then when you play this along with the original track it will cancel out all of the frequencies present in that original except for the vocal (as they aren&#039;t present in the instrumental).<br /><br />For this to work properly, the two tracks need to be identical, i.e. the instrumental is exactly the same as the original, just minus the vocal.<br />&nbsp;Lot&#039;s of artists include instrumentals as bonus tracks so matching audio files can be pretty easy to find.<br /><br />Have fun...<br /><br />: )
