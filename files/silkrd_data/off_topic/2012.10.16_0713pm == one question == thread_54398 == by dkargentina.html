				If the package is intercepted in transit, opened and found to contain drugs, most postal services simply destroy the item. In other cases you may receive a warning letter from your postal service. It is very unlikely that you will get a knock at your door, but not entirely inconceivable.<br /><br />I would avoid having the item addressed to you. I get the items sent to my home address but with someone else&#039;s name. If the worse comes to the worse, I can deny ownership of the item and claim it was addressed incorrectly. <br /><br />It sounds like your strategy is a bit high risk. I wouldn&#039;t be running the risk of your mail being opened by anyone else. Most vendors package items very discretely, such that, even if an item was opened, it wouldn&#039;t be immediately obvious that it contained drugs, but not all vendors are as careful. Better safe than sorry.

				Put the company&#039;s name on it care of your name if it just has the company&#039;s name on it who exactly would open that?<br /><br />Example:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Felching Brothers INC.<br />C/O dkargentina<br /><br /><br />
