				Hi all,<br /><br />Doing a (non-SR related) feature for mainstream (Fairfax) media as part of a drug reform series.&nbsp; My article is &quot;The case for ecstasy&quot;.&nbsp; It is examining the Australia21 [google it] recommendation to decriminalise ecstasy and questioning the justification for ecstasy remaining illegal, especially when compared to alcohol.<br /><br />I want to hear from as many ecstasy users as possible.&nbsp; I already have plenty of RL examples, but opening it up to the community here as well :) .<br /><br />If you are interested in being involved:&nbsp; I won&#039;t be quoting any anonymous SR users, but if you have something you feel strongly about that you would like to see reported on and don&#039;t care about it not being attributed to you, feel free to PM me - my PGP key is in my sig if you need it.&nbsp; <br /><br />For any who are happy to speak to me as yourselves, please email me at eileyinmelbourne at gmail dot com.&nbsp; For your own protection, don&#039;t mention your username in that correspondence.&nbsp; If you&#039;re really paranoid, PM me for my tormail address, but I don&#039;t check that unless I&#039;m expecting something.<br /><br />I&#039;m particularly keen on hearing from people who have given up/almost given up alcohol in favour of mdma for a night out, but I am happy to hear from all sorts of mdma users.<br /><br />Under Victorian and Commonwealth law, as a journalist, I am protected from being forced to disclose the identity of confidential sources in court proceedings (i.e. LE cannot force me to reveal your name or any other details).&nbsp; Not that I would anyway, but it&#039;s awesome that now I can&#039;t be sent to jail for it. :) <br />In any event, it would be professional suicide for me to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please feel free to check my website (in my sig) for my blogs and links to previous published articles in The Age/SMH among others.<br /><br />Hope to hear from you.<br /><br />x Eiley<br /><br />

				Totally missed the OP OzFreelancer! would have been happy to share. There is no way AU will ever go down the decriminalization route though, not really a vote winner when you have right wing fucktards like Abbott leading the charge. <br /><br />In a country that still uses massive amounts of police resources and tax payers money to send sniffer dogs into the cross at 3am or have dog teams in train stations on a Wednesday evening as I used to see at Bondi Junction every second week you really have to wonder where the priorities are.<br /><br />Catching a handful of clubbers with a pill or two clearly tops the crime agenda, how do we sleep at night!!
