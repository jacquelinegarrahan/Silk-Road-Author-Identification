				I had an interesting evening. After a long day of work (video games and bong rips), this chick I know texts me saying she got kicked out of this party and can&#039;t drive home. She was loaded on xanax and booze. So, dark knight that I am, I set out on the mean streets of [REDACTED] at 2am to entertain my friend. <br /><br />I&#039;d had my fair share of xannies by that point.<br /><br />I get there like an hour later and shes just chillin in her car, jamming tunes and blowing a blunt, drinkin a coldbeers. Now, I come from a humble background. No Wayne Enterprises unfortunately, though SR has begun to be kind to me. She&#039;s rich, so the car is fantastic. I climb in and she hands me a beer and a xanax and just bullshited for like 2 or 3 hours. She doesn&#039;t like dudes, so no dice there. It was still good times though.<br /><br />I roll out about 4 or 5am, slighty intoxicated but still got a grip. On my way home, at a stop light or something, I see this pretty well dress dude hangin out looking at me. My first instinct? &quot;You holdin&quot;, lol. I still had a decent drive ahead of me, like 30 minutes, so I was thinking about some yummy coke to get right. Alas, I only had $15 on me. <br /><br />I don&#039;t go to the ATM after drinking/xanax at 5 am for anything but ransom money.<br /><br />So he&#039;s says he&#039;s got some crack for cheap. I&#039;ve tried it once, ages ago when it was big, but I was like FUGGIT!<br />So I scored and make it home with no arrests. I must have looked like the monkey from 2012 space odyssey trying to figure out how to smoke this fucking thing. The interwebs is def going to save our species, but it doesn&#039;t know shit about DIY crack pipes. I know the straight/choreboy deal, but they don&#039;t sell straights in my part of town. <br /><br />Who the fuck has choreboy around house? Oh yeah, ppl that clean, that explains its absence at my abode. <br /><br />Anyway, rigged up an appropriate device and gave it a spin. The taste is pretty interesting, and it must not have been too bad a product as I didn&#039;t find myself wanting to prostitute myself at anytime for more and I caught a mean buzz for the small amount I had. There is something to be said about the all to allusive &quot;everything is right in the world&quot; feeling.<br /><br />Two coldbeers and a joint later I was out like the dead.<br /><br />My Friday night.<br />Yours?<br /><br />

				Short version: Babysat 6 people who were rolling balls last night, I was sober myself. Whole night was this hilarious but overwhelming blur of people on molly.I left after 2 hours when they began discussing an MDMA-orgy and started getting too touchy feely with me. Should mention I&#039;m in a committed and great relationship.
