				Marijuana dealer gets 8 years in prison<br /><br />ROCK FALLS â€“ A Rock Falls man whom police said was a significant local marijuana dealer was sentenced to 8 years in prison.<br /><br />He pleaded guilty Wednesday to selling marijuana. He was give credit for 484 days served in Whiteside County Jail, and ordered to pay more than $6,000 in court fines and fees.<br /><br />The Illinois State Police Blackhawk Area Task Force investigated Contreras for 2 years before his arrest in September 2011. A search of his home turned up 1.82 pounds of marijuana, 67 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, and some drug paraphernalia.

				8 years is common practice for charges of that magnitude in my area (1st offense). 2nd offense will get you about 15. Keep in mind, you only have to do a fraction of your time in actual prison.

				Prisons are not the problem, laws are. We DO need to lock someone people away. Or, we could start executing. I mean, to say someone who takes part in the rape or killing of innocent people.. actually, they should be put to death. But ONLY after they get a fair trial. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;d rather not have murderers and rapists let loose. So uh, we do not have much of a choice here. But for shit like weed?&nbsp; Make someone pay a small fine or whatever. But to take their freedom is just unacceptable in my eyes.

If the individual was temporarily insane, he should be released. He will not harm other people again. Repeat offenders will be dealt with.<br /><br />If an individual is deemed scientifically to be an active danger to women and children, etc, then I would say, if nothing else can be done, then he or she should be mercy-slain.<br /><br />I detest prisons, and I do not see any reason that prisons should exist at all.<br /><br />Juvenile Prisons should be outlawed.

				I agree with most of what you said, however, I am looking at people who served time, only to get out and murder/rape again. <br /><br /><br />I have one for you, what about handing these people over to families? Eye-for-an-eye, I do agree with, 110%. Things change when a loved one is a victim. Forget the rights of such people, they lost those rights when they take the life of the innocent. Idk.

				If hardened killers and rapists seriously harm the loved one of a family, it is the responsibility of that family to seek Justice how they deem fit.<br /><br />I&#039;d tentatively suggest a Justice Insurance System, where you can afford the services of Private Defense Agencies in the event of attack.

				Here her, ray. <br /><br />Also, just consider the consequences, what that says, when we tell people they will not risk losing their lives if they take the life of another. Your heart is in the right place, but it is not , well, I am willing to bet we&#039;d have a lot more rapists/murderers if we just said &quot;Hey, we do not accept what you have done. And to express this, we will pamper you in some facility. And who knows? Maybe after we pamper you for a few years, you will re-think what you&#039;ve done!&quot; <br /><br />I believe the point of telling society &quot;If you kill , you will be killed&quot; is to prevent. And while we still have such crimes, surely it would get worse if we went too easy on people. Its not a perfect system because we are not perfect. Simple as.

				We in the west are too spoiled. Too relaxed. We will not see any &quot;revolution&quot;, nothing like people go on about, for quite some time. Like it or not. We&#039;re very lazy, and do not give a shit when you get right down to it. We need absolute hell on earth before we&#039;re motivated to actually do anything. <br /><br /><br />I foresee a few negatives my way, bu whatever. It&#039;s truth. We only learn after we get our teeth kicked in. <br /><br />edit: Also, everyday people are not interested in making a fuss. They simply want to live, and provide for their families. When you make a fuss, it threatens to disrupt the family unit, etc. THIS is why it will not work, ever. And THIS is why we need something very, very bad, to motivate MORE people. That is when change not only comes, but is forced. But yeah, good luck with that.
