				DMT, LSD, Caapi, Mushrooms, MDMA, 2C-B, <br /><br />and yes lots and lots and lots of weeeeeed!<br /><br />So after I have done the ringing the relatives bit, spoken to the other half while she at her parents, I intend on getting fucked.<br /><br />How would you structure the day?<br /><br />Interested to know the Road&#039;s thoughts on this.

				I think you&#039;ve got a great day planned for yourself because my plans are quite similar; ring the relatives then get baked and stay baked. <br /><br />I am really looking forward to a bit of peace and quiet and getting to do whatever I want to do.&nbsp; I might stay in my PJs all day long.&nbsp; <br /><br />Have you ever done Christmas on your own before??&nbsp; I have not, hope I don&#039;t end up regretting the decision to blow off Christmas this year ...

				I did shrooms and MDMA once. Christ that was intense. If you manage to consume more than half of those drugs in one day, that would be impressive. :)
