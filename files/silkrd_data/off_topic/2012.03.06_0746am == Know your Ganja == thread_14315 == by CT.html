				It&#039;s all about the relative ratio of cannabinoids / terpenes. Everything else is just heritage. Remember you can breed an Aghan land race with an indica grow 100 plants, and have 3 hidden recessive sativa phenos. So in the end it&#039;s really about cannabinoid / terpene ratio. Also don&#039;t see why all those list couldn&#039;t be one post.<br /><br />~Digi

				thats kinda my point, I think an indica could posses any of those properties and the same goes for a sativa... all depends on the genetics of that particular phenotype. I would say the strains that actually stand apart are those with particularly unusual cannabinoid ratios, like those high in cannabidiol vs thc <br /><br />&nbsp;interesting about the recessive phenos DA, that explains a lot I stupidly never considered about cannabis genetics. <br /><br />I found a freaking jupiter OG seed in a nug from lexi! this may be my first undertaking and I want to do it right. can you point me toward any helpful resources if I decide to give it a grow?<br /><br />

				Thank you DA for the awesome info and response to my question! I appreciate the help from an obvious expert <br /><br />CT you should take a lesson from DA &gt; your claims dont mean shit unless you back them up with some scientific evidence at least partially supporting what you say... just like you offering weed but not having a seller acct, cant back your shit up and youre just running your mouth, wastin your breath. or you know you could just ignore me some more... I was just curious about reading the resources you knew, but it is clear you have other motives than benefiting the members and status of this community

				CT, this was probably one of the more useless ganja threads. Pretty much you just told us your opinion on what weed is good for what. <br /><br />Can you have some facts to back up these claims?<br /><br />DA thank you for all that very interesting information. I def learned a lot.<br /><br />CT take a lesson from him. :)

				So I am confused, it seems to me the stuff DA is saying actually supports CT statement.&nbsp; That the combinations of the chemicals in the herb produce different effects.&nbsp; So your saying if I have some mexican sativa and I smoke it, that I could actually get a energy filled buzz like when I smoke an indica dominate plant.&nbsp; Or I could get a sativa high of an indica dominant plant????<br /><br />Cause that is how I take it, and although there may be exceptions to this rule, from prit near all my experiences this has been so.&nbsp; Different varieties of weed have different highs, due to like DA says the combinations and ratios of the active chemicals.&nbsp; <br /><br />It doesnt seem crazy to me at all that after years of medical cannabis the pharmacies have found that different strains of genetics have different ratios off chemicals and help to treat different ailments.......makes total sense to me.&nbsp; Is your point that those ratios vary over generations then???? So it is hard to say an indica will always show indica traits????&nbsp; I mean I would think that the differences on average wouldnt be that large.
