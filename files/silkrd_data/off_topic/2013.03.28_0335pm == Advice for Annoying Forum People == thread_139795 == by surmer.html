				There,&nbsp; I just gave you a -1 just to show you it doesn&#039;t matter dude. . . the karma thing is a joke. nothing serious there at all.<br /><br />Look at mine&nbsp; hehe same deal. . lots of negative. <br /><br />its a FACT&nbsp; the more you post, the more negative karma you get.&nbsp; You have to piss off someone sometime as people have different views.&nbsp; You could just post dumb opinionless shit but nobody will remember you. .<br /><br />Some people here use their gender to get people to like them. (some chicks talk all sex and get the little teen boys all wild up on the forums and make lots of friends with many teen little boys) <br /><br />Others give insightful advice at every turn.&nbsp; Some troll and always have negative shit to say.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to see some people post more positive shit. .&nbsp; everyone here is manic depressive yeeeesh!&nbsp; &nbsp;;-)

				Sorry to say surmer, but you asked the question. To be honest, threads like this are rather annoying and actually pointless. As some others have already posted, on an anonymous forum do you really give a shit if you get some negative karma from someone you don&#039;t know and never will? Who cares if someone doesn&#039;t like what your online persona posted! As long as you don&#039;t threaten anyone or cross the line when making your point, post what you think and stop worrying about what others may think. Be true to your beliefs and what you stand for in life. Most people in the world will have those who dislike them for whatever reason, that&#039;s just how life is. Equally, there are others who will like you. The karma system in reality is nothing but a gimmick and shouldn&#039;t be taken seriously. ;)

				I think it&#039;s because some links open up outside of TOR browser in your regula browser.&nbsp; This could expose your IP to the website and if timed right, they could tells you were following a link from the SR forum.&nbsp; Some shit like that. . .&nbsp; &nbsp;As if. <br /><br />If you need to be told about this, then you probably shouldn&#039;t be doing anything over the top illegal.&nbsp; For most people who are not vendors and terrorists, it&#039;s not an issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;For those who it is an issue for, they should take the time to learn the software .&nbsp; This way we all don&#039;t have to write the damn ***clearnet warning. <br /><br /><br />******WARNNING&nbsp; &nbsp;You are doing something illegal .&nbsp; Use caution. <br /><br />I mean really though .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I guess some of the biggest confusion here is that we are using a discussion forum software.&nbsp; It&#039;s implied that we will be engaged in discussions here.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is technical support software out there thet manages requests in a ticket system of open and closed tickets/ resolved issues, but they seem to prefer to use this software for support instead.&nbsp; Then some people complain that the forums are filled with annoying posts and discussions.&nbsp; Strange.<br /><br />I have a lot to learn.<br />

				Wear your neg karma like a badge of honor. It&#039;s only weedy, wishy washy twats that want to be everyone&#039;s friend that end up with no negs.

				Don&#039;t give it a second thought. Speak your mind, it doesn&#039;t help anybody if you pitter patter around afraid of insulting someone. If you say something really ignorant, maybe someone will sternly correct you. That is a good thing, learn something! None of us are all knowing, or have similar view points since we all have our own experiences. That&#039;s not to say be rude, but speak your mind.

				Thanks. Yeah, I&#039;m still getting used to the &quot;anonymous&quot; TOR-net. Initially, I started pouring out my insanity in an attempt to create a LE nightmare... but after a good nights rest and deeper reflection, I realized how counterproductive that is for others, LE, and myself.

				Personally if I see a member with really high Positive Karma but a really low Negative Karma like say 180+/ 3- then it kind of makes me not trust this person as they clearly must talk a lot of shit to keep every one on side.<br /><br />Dont sweat it, just completely change as a person, do everything different, be the total opposite to what you are now, only eat brown bread, stay up all night and sleep all day, grow a beard, play all your records backwards, watch the tv upside down, brush your teeth with your feet and above all remember to never be yourself!<br /><br />P.S I was being sarcastic then, just in case, you never know :)<br /><br />

				OK. The real deal: I both love to annoy people in addition to help them. I am bipolar... <br /><br />..or at least have bipolar tendencies, or maybe schizophrenic tendencies. Too much drug use, you say? No... or maybe, yes... I don&#039;t know. Does anyone know?--other than the recently discovered genetic trait that people with mental illness, of all kinds, share. Bipolar, depression, ADHD, schizophrenia.... Not everyone with the gene gets all fucked up, but all the fucked up people seem to share the same gene.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this thread both annoys you and enlightens you. I am insanity. I am Jesus. I will both save your soul while threatening you with eternal damnation. On the other hand, I just wanna make friends. Or enemies. Fuck, sometimes I wish I never posted anything.

Sorry for the &quot;trolling&quot;, but I&#039;m planning for law school. Racism is a big issue for me. I don&#039;t consider myself a racist, but the subject gets such a negative light that no one talks about it. It&#039;s a taboo that is not poorly understood, yet far from complete.... and when you stir up emotional shit, you sometimes get very honest responses. It is a measure of how sincere members here really are. Those are my hidden motives.<br /><br />I&#039;ve worked for Jewish people. I&#039;ve dated a wonderfully beautiful Jewish girl, an Israeli girl, a Russian girl. Very close friends have been of many races. I will work hard to express this truth. I poke and prod to get reactions. When people are under stress, they often react reflexively, but this is frequently backed by their fundamental beliefs. I don&#039;t have fundamental beliefs, but I am agnostic toward the Good--good people, good friends, good drugs. I started this thread to get just what you gave me, the truth. Sometimes my mind wanders, and I get tired. My heart turns to ice, but that&#039;s the beautiful thing about this forum. I have the opportunity to reflect and share the truth about why I do the stupid things I do on the forum, while saving rational and calculated behavior for life AFK.<br /><br />Sorry to put my intentions in such a murky state of discussion, but that&#039;s how life works, I guess. For me, that&#039;s how it comes out anyway. Thanks for reading. Thanks for replying. Thanks for SR. I am working hard to continue to be a customer and ongoing support by not fucking up AFK.

Trolling is trying to piss people off for fun. Spamming, pointless topics, negativity.&nbsp; A lot of the narrow minded pricks around here feed into the negativity. Paying them no attention is the best thing to do. Because last time i checked peoples meaningless opinions have no effect on you. Unless you of course let them. It&#039;s mostly sad fucks that have nothing better to do than waste their time and spread negativity. Of course the only people that pay any attention to it are usually the less wise folk. Maybe they&#039;ll learn someday, catch up with the rest of humanity.<br /><br />2. I think the clearnet warning is for new users. I didn&#039;t know about that when i was new. I still have a lot to learn though, i&#039;m just grateful for all the helpful/intelligent members around here.<br /><br />3. Its always ok to use a different name.
