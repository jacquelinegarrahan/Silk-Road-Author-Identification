				Good luck man, but the path to enlightenment sometimes takes some weird detours. As has often been said, it&#039;s sometimes a sane response to an insane situation that gets you into those places.<br /><br />Can highly recommend a (short) book by the psychoanalyst RD Laing &quot;The Politics of Experience&quot;, nailed a lot of stuff for me.<br /><br />

Damn man you&#039;re in a Hilton compared to the places I was institutionalized. You get to have a laptop AND an internet connection.<br />&nbsp;That laptop is considered a &quot;sharp&quot; meaning it could be a weapon, in this case a bludgeoning device. When I was inside I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; even have hardback books or&nbsp; art supplies(certainly not any paint, I could swallow that and try to kill myself apparently they didn&#039;t understand what &quot;non-toxic&#039; meant, same exact reason they took soap out of the bathroom, people were swallowing massive amounts of soap trying to kill themselves). And you get internet that&#039;s amazing, granted they have whatever censoring program on it but it is still a great privilege and you bypassed it to get on the SR forums, props for shenanigans. I certainly wasn&#039;t allowed a cellphone, laptop, or any electronic device. I am beyond surprised they let you bring your laptop, I&#039;m going to guess it has a webcam on it. which is another reason they wouldn&#039;t allow it. Confidentiality. They don&#039;t want people taking pictures of other patients and violating the medical privacy, they can get sued for that. Anyway keep us updated but not at the expense of your laptop, getting friends or family to sneak you in a pre-paid 3G usb stick is a great idea. You get cigarette breaks? How&#039;s the food? One of the hospitals I was in I was served day after day what looked like catfood and catshit mixed together and to this day I have no idea what the fuck it was they served us I lost a lot of weight in that one, not to mention the one community bathroom we had was broken for 3 days (on day two a patient jumped up on top of the nurses desk proceeded to shit and piss on a the nurses computer monitor... they got right on it after that episode) and when it wasn&#039;t broken you had to go get a fucking key from the nurses desk (usually they were too busy to be bothered with something like caring for the patients, even something as simple as giving them the key to the bathroom, or getting you a blanket, or even a snack for a diabetic patient with low blood sugar, that patient started to freak out and cried and wept continuously for hours pleading for help and they wouldn&#039;t do anything but sedate her after 3 straight hours of that. So low-blood sugar with no food combined with tranquilizers equals a diabetic coma, no shit all this really happened) That one was the worst I&#039;ve ever been in. We had ONE doctor for 6 floors of patients about 20 patients on each floor which basically meant you get almost 5 minutes with the doctor to try and figure out what medicine you need to take, plus that damn doctor barely spoke English so that was a hellish 2 weeks. It was almost as bad as when I was in an institute that was full they didn&#039;t have any beds so I spent three days in a extremely overcrowded room sleeping in a chair (my back was fucking killing me) and they wouldn&#039;t let us sleep on the fucking floor because too many people had shit and pissed all over it and they hadn&#039;t brought anyone in to clean the damn carpets. Anyway I&#039;ve got a million stories not all of them about malpractice but I should stop here with the stories anyway. Pisses me off about all the gun debates going on right now, nobody gives two fucks about America&#039;s piss-poor state of mental health care. That would require a lot of money that nobody wants to give up (certainly not the insurance companies) however stricter gun laws will cost a whole lot less and get guns away from civilians. Also now that you&#039;ve been institutionalized you can no longer buy a gun, Brady laws prohibit that, assuming you&#039;re American. I actually agree with that one even though it means I can&#039;t have a gun<br /><br />My advice... Don&#039;t make the doctors nervous with your knowledge, that will only make them keep you longer. You are superior to their intelligence, work them don&#039;t let them work you. Use it against those stupid quacks. My trick was to pretend how happy and upbeat I was when in reality I was freaking the fuck out. So I pretended to be happy and having the fucking time of my life and the meds were actually working. When I was asked &quot;You think you&#039;re ready to get out?&quot; I would reply, &quot;I could stay here a few more days, I&#039;m doing good here, do you think I&#039;m ready doctor?&quot; if you show panic they&#039;ll keep you there longer. Plus this is the only time you will be glad you&#039;re insurance company doesn&#039;t want to pay for medical expenses. Right now it is costing them thousands to keep you in there, after a week or a few days&nbsp; they&#039;ll basically send the doctor a message that is basically &quot;Is he ready to get out, can we stop paying for this shit yet?&quot; (depending on your behavior, go to groups, get up when they wake you up, try and eat, participate in group, engage the staff in conversation and make them laugh charm the hell out of them) that is when the doctor will ask you if you think you&#039;re ready to leave remember of course to be calm and &quot;normal&quot;, don&#039;t panic don&#039;t even act slightly eager to leave. Act like it is no big deal even though you want out so bad. The insurance company will put pressure on the doctor to decide whether or not you are ready to leave so take advantage of the insurance companies avarice and the stupidity of the psychiatrists and their inability to read people.<br /><br />Let us know how it went when you get out <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Wow, Copycats, my stay here seems like holidays in the Burj Al Arab compared to the &quot;institutions&quot; you were in. I have my laptop, cell phone and all kinds of stuff I could theoretically use to kill myself, including a blow drier. One could almost have the impression that no one gives a shit here except they actually do. There&#039;s at least two nurses here 24/7 who answer all my questions. There&#039;s space for only 18 people in this ward and each ward has its own doctor so he has plenty of time for everyone.<br />That thing with the medical privacy is the same here but I can still have my laptop and cellphone which has a camera, I&#039;m just not allowed to take photos of anyone without their consent, but that&#039;s the law in Germany anyway.<br />Anyone can smoke whenever the fuck they want, there&#039;s a balcony for that and there&#039;s two recreation rooms, one of which is for smokers and both have flat-screen TVs.<br />The food is awesome compared to the shit I had in other regular hospitals.<br />There&#039;s no such thing as community bathrooms here, each room (with two people living in it) has its own bathroom with a shower.<br />It&#039;s fucking ridiculous. I always thought of psychiatric wards as those horrible places like you described but apparently not where I live. Thank God for that shit :D<br />And about the gun thing, I&#039;m in Germany so I can&#039;t have a gun anyway (legally at least ::) ;) :P 8)) so being institutionalized doesn&#039;t change anything for me in that regard.<br /><br />And yeah, I&#039;m gradually starting to play a little bit dumb to spare the doctor&#039;s self esteem. I think I scared the shit out of him during the first interview. He actually asked me if I had memorized my &quot;symptoms&quot; from Google searches because I was so articulate :D<br />I&#039;m not bent on getting out as quickly as possible although I don&#039;t particularly like being here of course. But it&#039;s free (gotta love the German health care system) and it&#039;s definitely helping me getting my act back together.

				Ballz this is my new account. I can&#039;t tell you my old accounts username because it is in the hands of LE. You had helped me out so much in the past on a certain project. I owe you man.<br />When I was a teenager I got sent away to the looney bin. My mom said that she didnt have the money for food for me so she called the police told them some crazy ass bullshit stories and I got sent away.<br />Clearly in The U.S. it is different. I remeber the crazy people trying to kill me with pencils. They didnt even allow shoes. Prison clothing. Checkups every 15 minutes. Your lucky you don&#039;t live here.<br /><br />All the best to you man, I really feel for you. You are a huge part of the reason my cause existed.<br />Thanks man<br />

				Good luck in there Ballz - Some of your threads on depression really helped me get out of a mindset that I had no idea at the time was affecting me so much. It was a simple realization :)<br /><br />Dr. Gabor Mate says that one of the hardest things to do is follow one&#039;s own advice. I hope that you can find resolution within yourself because, truly, you are gifted with the insight (and curse) of self reflection.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Also, if they prescribe you anything really fucking crazy then send it to us :)<br />

FML. The only real entertainment I get is making the doctors nervous with my knowledge (they seem to prefer dumb sheeple).<br />I&#039;ll try to be here as much as possible but I might not make it because I can&#039;t use Tor Browser because the public computer here is locked down with a shitty software called SiteKiosk. I ripped the LAN cable out of the computer and connected it to my laptop to write this but I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s not allowed. They don&#039;t have WiFi either so I might not be here for some time :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stay SNEAKY, I bet you anything they will take your laptop if the see you have the LAN hooked up to it. <br /><br />Also.... Damn man you&#039;re in a Hilton compared to the places I was institutionalized. You get to have a laptop AND an internet connection.<br />&nbsp;That laptop is considered a &quot;sharp&quot; meaning it could be a weapon, in this case a bludgeoning device. When I was inside I couldn&#039;t&nbsp; even have hardback books or&nbsp; art supplies(certainly not any paint, I could swallow that and try to kill myself apparently they didn&#039;t understand what &quot;non-toxic&#039; meant, same exact reason they took soap out of the bathroom, people were swallowing massive amounts of soap trying to kill themselves). And you get internet that&#039;s amazing, granted they have whatever censoring program on it but it is still a great privilege and you bypassed it to get on the SR forums, props for shenanigans. I certainly wasn&#039;t allowed a cellphone, laptop, or any electronic device. I am beyond surprised they let you bring your laptop, I&#039;m going to guess it has a webcam on it. which is another reason they wouldn&#039;t allow it. Confidentiality. They don&#039;t want people taking pictures of other patients and violating the medical privacy, they can get sued for that. Anyway keep us updated but not at the expense of your laptop, getting friends or family to sneak you in a pre-paid 3G usb stick is a great idea. You get cigarette breaks? How&#039;s the food? One of the hospitals I was in I was served day after day what looked like catfood and catshit mixed together and to this day I have no idea what the fuck it was they served us I lost a lot of weight in that one, not to mention the one community bathroom we had was broken for 3 days (on day two a patient jumped up on top of the nurses desk proceeded to shit and piss on a the nurses computer monitor... they got right on it after that episode) and when it wasn&#039;t broken you had to go get a fucking key from the nurses desk (usually they were too busy to be bothered with something like caring for the patients, even something as simple as giving them the key to the bathroom, or getting you a blanket, or even a snack for a diabetic patient with low blood sugar, that patient started to freak out and cried and wept continuously for hours pleading for help and they wouldn&#039;t do anything but sedate her after 3 straight hours of that. So low-blood sugar with no food combined with tranquilizers equals a diabetic coma, no shit all this really happened) That one was the worst I&#039;ve ever been in. We had ONE doctor for 6 floors of patients about 20 patients on each floor which basically meant you get almost 5 minutes with the doctor to try and figure out what medicine you need to take, plus that damn doctor barely spoke English so that was a hellish 2 weeks. It was almost as bad as when I was in an institute that was full they didn&#039;t have any beds so I spent three days in a extremely overcrowded room sleeping in a chair (my back was fucking killing me) and they wouldn&#039;t let us sleep on the fucking floor because too many people had shit and pissed all over it and they hadn&#039;t brought anyone in to clean the damn carpets. Anyway I&#039;ve got a million stories not all of them about malpractice but I should stop here with the stories anyway. Pisses me off about all the gun debates going on right now, nobody gives two fucks about America&#039;s piss-poor state of mental health care. That would require a lot of money that nobody wants to give up (certainly not the insurance companies) however stricter gun laws will cost a whole lot less and get guns away from civilians. Also now that you&#039;ve been institutionalized you can no longer buy a gun, Brady laws prohibit that, assuming you&#039;re American. I actually agree with that one even though it means I can&#039;t have a gun<br /><br />My advice... Don&#039;t make the doctors nervous with your knowledge, that will only make them keep you longer. You are superior to their intelligence, work them don&#039;t let them work you. Use it against those stupid quacks. My trick was to pretend how happy and upbeat I was when in reality I was freaking the fuck out. So I pretended to be happy and having the fucking time of my life and the meds were actually working. When I was asked &quot;You think you&#039;re ready to get out?&quot; I would reply, &quot;I could stay here a few more days, I&#039;m doing good here, do you think I&#039;m ready doctor?&quot; if you show panic they&#039;ll keep you there longer. Plus this is the only time you will be glad you&#039;re insurance company doesn&#039;t want to pay for medical expenses. Right now it is costing them thousands to keep you in there, after a week or a few days&nbsp; they&#039;ll basically send the doctor a message that is basically &quot;Is he ready to get out, can we stop paying for this shit yet?&quot; (depending on your behavior, go to groups, get up when they wake you up, try and eat, participate in group, engage the staff in conversation and make them laugh charm the hell out of them) that is when the doctor will ask you if you think you&#039;re ready to leave remember of course to be calm and &quot;normal&quot;, don&#039;t panic don&#039;t even act slightly eager to leave. Act like it is no big deal even though you want out so bad. The insurance company will put pressure on the doctor to decide whether or not you are ready to leave so take advantage of the insurance companies avarice and the stupidity of the psychiatrists and their inability to read people.<br /><br />Let us know how it went when you get out <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Wow, Copycats, my stay here seems like holidays in the Burj Al Arab compared to the &quot;institutions&quot; you were in. I have my laptop, cell phone and all kinds of stuff I could theoretically use to kill myself, including a blow drier. One could almost have the impression that no one gives a shit here except they actually do. There&#039;s at least two nurses here 24/7 who answer all my questions. There&#039;s space for only 18 people in this ward and each ward has its own doctor so he has plenty of time for everyone.<br />That thing with the medical privacy is the same here but I can still have my laptop and cellphone which has a camera, I&#039;m just not allowed to take photos of anyone without their consent, but that&#039;s the law in Germany anyway.<br />Anyone can smoke whenever the fuck they want, there&#039;s a balcony for that and there&#039;s two recreation rooms, one of which is for smokers and both have flat-screen TVs.<br />The food is awesome compared to the shit I had in other regular hospitals.<br />There&#039;s no such thing as community bathrooms here, each room (with two people living in it) has its own bathroom with a shower.<br />It&#039;s fucking ridiculous. I always thought of psychiatric wards as those horrible places like you described but apparently not where I live. Thank God for that shit :D<br />And about the gun thing, I&#039;m in Germany so I can&#039;t have a gun anyway (legally at least ::) ;) :P 8)) so being institutionalized doesn&#039;t change anything for me in that regard.<br /><br />And yeah, I&#039;m gradually starting to play a little bit dumb to spare the doctor&#039;s self esteem. I think I scared the shit out of him during the first interview. He actually asked me if I had memorized my &quot;symptoms&quot; from Google searches because I was so articulate :D<br />I&#039;m not bent on getting out as quickly as possible although I don&#039;t particularly like being here of course. But it&#039;s free (gotta love the German health care system) and it&#039;s definitely helping me getting my act back together.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />these shit painting lunatics should be put on trains and sent to the gas chambers
