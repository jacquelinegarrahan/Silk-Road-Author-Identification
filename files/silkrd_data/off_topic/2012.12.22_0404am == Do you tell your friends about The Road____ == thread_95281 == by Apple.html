				Due to nature of my work I tend not to tell anyone about some of my hobbies. That includes ordering funny substances from complete strangers over the internets, the places where I might order such stuff and especially I keep to myself the fact that every saturday I head to planet psychedelia while other people are busy getting drunk.<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to be a smooth project manager during the week and sail with my interstellar starship called This Meatbag I&#039;m Wearing to other dimensions without either disturbing (too much) the other.

				Yes. Key word, friend. Not my customers or sellers or my dealer acquaintances. Just my closest of friends.<br /><br />Hah, I remember a time when I would get nervous about people in my area finding out about SR. I didn&#039;t want people sharing my connects. I wanted to be the only guy getting my shit for cheap. Then I found out that half the &quot;big dawgs&quot; in my area get their stuff through mail too. Not sure if SR or not, but same to me. Sometimes I share it with other dealers, but only if I think it&#039;s going to benefit me. As in a stronger connect, maybe someone who will have my back in the future. As long as it&#039;s not some dumb ass kid opening his mouth to everyone then it&#039;s fine by me.

				I&#039;ve told a couple of my closest friends about it. There are numerous good friends I would never tell about it because they have addictive tendencies and Silk Road would make them absolutely self-destruct.....<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t tell anybody else because I frankly I feel most people would be stupid about it and get drugs-in-the-mail more on the radar of LE and that generally the less people that know about SR, the better.

				Never. If they haven&#039;t found it for themselves then I don&#039;t say a word. As the two sayings go - &quot;Loose lips sink ships&quot; and &quot;Just because you can, doesn&#039;t mean you should.&quot; There are some people on SR who should follow that principle.

				I dont tell or speak to anyone about the road, unless they already know about the road. (in which case they were the ones that told me about the road)<br />But i do tell people i get stuff sent over by a mate.. which i really shouldnt. (But I kind of needed a story as to where i get it from..)<br /><br />At the end of the day, the more people you tell means:<br /><br />More orders - Customs picking up more orders/easily profiling packages.<br />Competition from other people selling stuff they also bought off the road as well.<br />Pricing - if they find out how much you payed, they wont pay as much. Thats if they dont go on the road and order it themselves.<br /><br />If anyone asks me about the road, i just tell them its bad news.. doesnt work... and you will lose your money.<br />

				Some of you seem to have the right idea, others... well, you need to take off the tin foil hat. Silk Road is supposed to be open to everyone first off. I get it though, the wrong people coming on here can start to fuck things up (scammers, lying addicts, that kinda shit).<br /><br />Silk Road is already kind of a jungle. A fun one at that. I really don&#039;t see how much of a difference, say, 1k new users would make. Sure, some new vendors and reliable connects, some trash... nothing CRAZY though.

				I have a (fictional) story of what happened to ME once when I asked a stranger about the silkroad, told from the perspective of my &#039;introducer&#039;:<br /><br />&quot;<br />One time, some crazy curious kid shows up asking &#039;bout the road.<br /><br />So in order to protect every one here I kidnapped him.<br />I whacked him over the head with a lamp, knocking him out. Then bound his feet and arms with the electrical cord.<br /><br />He came too in the boot of my car after I had driven him deep into the wilderness. I gave him a drink he drank from that carbonated water bottle like it was his last drink. The water had like 50 hits of acid in it.<br />I closed the boot and opened it when the acid had kicked in.<br /><br />Then I dragged him out and lay him down in front of the car. <br />By this time it was dark, By dark I am referring to both my state of mind, my intentions as well as the moonlit scenery.<br /><br />I wanted to rape him but instead I only threatened too. He was crying. I lit him up with the car headlights and in a god-like tone explained how dark the deep web can get.<br />I let him know in no uncertain terms what he was letting himself in for if he were to wander onto the dark side of the deep web.<br />That what he was experiencing now was Nothing compared to what he was in for. The result of interfering or inquiring about forces greater than the good of human spirit.<br /><br />I let him know that my soul was gone to the silk road and that he still had a chance.&nbsp; That I was going to spare him just this once.<br />I let him know that he now had a choice, choose life or forever be a slave to your desires.<br />&quot;<br /><br />Long story short, I concluded that life without desires means that you have no desires to fulfill. This leads to emptiness. The road has taken me and I will probably never return.<br />The silk road is not a road at all......It is a One-Way-Street.<br /><br />It is now my turn to plan what action&nbsp; I will take next time someone turns up asking about this sacred hellishly deep path.<br />

				Most people seem to not be as interested in the road as I that I&#039;ve told.. to me this is the greatest place I could have ever stumbled upon or well been taught how to access. there is so much potential for greatness here, so many bright minds (and fried ones too ;))<br /><br />I showed my grandpaps the road the other day.. he thought I was the devil. Then I told him it was fake and he said whew I knew such a place couldn&#039;t exist, the government wouldn&#039;t let that happen! LOL I giggled. <br /><br />

				lol most people really cannot believe it is true. <br />Even with all the news coverage your average joe public internet user probably doesn&#039;t realize how easy it is.<br />Most people will forget about a news story after a few months and never try to research further. Especially if in real life they do not knowingly mix with drug users.<br /><br />Even people who take drugs will often stop after a few internet searches out of fear of getting either ripped off or busted.<br />Even when if they find out how to access the road, they may be turned off by things like bitcoin instead of paypal, intermittent loading times/problems, fear of being scammed , high prices etc.<br /><br />I had heard about it on the news a couple of times and then forgot about it for like 6 months until I thought what the fuck might as well give it a blast.

				I&#039;ve told my best mates... <br /><br />Obviously everybody has heard of it... and everybody already has an opinion thanks to the mass media brainwashing.. <br /><br />Friend: &quot;Ohhh yeeah Silk Road - I&#039;d stay well clear of it.&quot; <br />Me: &quot;Why have u even checked out the site, do u have any idea at all?&quot;<br />Friend: &quot;Umm no actually&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Well then gtfo and stfu&quot;.<br /><br />These are the kinda people that always believe whatever rumour is going around without ever finding out about it for themselves. It&#039;s amazing how people instantly already have an opinion without having any basis for it...&nbsp; Mostly all my mates are well connected and can get great drugs pretty easily for personal use. <br /><br />I honestly think that Tor, Bitcoins and PGP is just a little bit too much for the average person... and that&#039;s where people make money, by seizing the day, taking risks understanding the technology. <br /><br />At the end of the day I hope they continue to be scared of the unknown ... cos that&#039;s where I make money.

				Sort of. Most of my close friends ask where I get such great weed for great prices, and I tell them through the mail. I don&#039;t specifically say SR though unless they ask.<br /><br />I only buy weed for personal consumption, I don&#039;t sell it so I don&#039;t give two shits if my friends wanted to use this place for themselves. Every single one of them is too pussy to try it though, they always ask me if they can give me money for me to buy it LOL.

				I found since coming to the SR, my how would I say &quot;desperation&quot;&nbsp; though that isn&#039;t the right word for it, has changed.<br /><br />me and a close group of friends have been buying coke locally 2-3 times a month for about 3 years&nbsp; now.<br /><br />When we get, we do it all, we want more, we planned all week, and it was a big deal. The coke we were getting in the beginning wasn&#039;t bad.. some decent 6 out off 10.. and even a few 8/10. In the last year.. total garbage waste of time shite. But my friends keep lining it up , looking for the good stuff. And I was still deperate enough to keep hitting it, even though I know its going to be garbage.<br /><br />that what was motivated me to get on the SR after a tip from a friend who had heard about it, but never tried.<br /><br />Now with SR, ordered a few times.. and what a world of difference. It&#039;s like the best secret club in the world. I get my moneys worth and more with less headache.<br /><br />But now I don&#039;t have that &quot; I need some drugs feeling&quot; I know I can get it anytime ( with some planning ).&nbsp; &nbsp;The new feeling is &quot;What should I try next&quot;&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I was just browsing the 2C-B, that is what is next, haha ,<br /><br />My best surprise so far has been low doses of 25c. felt like a joint with shrooms... great time.. I have more sitting here I will try in the next day or 2.. see if its a repeat<br /><br />as for my friends.. I only shared with one.. but never told him how to get on, now he just gives me cash every now n then and I make an order<br /><br />I make the assumption, anywhere at anytime, someone is listening.. so I don&#039;t say anything.<br /><br />LE is paid very very well to catch dealers. Don&#039;t assume they will overlook even the smallest of details. some may. But only takes 1 officer, 1 time to look into a lead.<br /><br />I also heard it&#039;s not just quanity but quality. &gt;90% pure coke or mdma, if they get it analyzed will assume you are closer to the source. A barrage of questions and investigation if u get nailed with even a small amount of something awesome.<br /><br />be cool and be careful out there. And don&#039;t speed or drink n drive if you are carrying your stuff. Sure way to get nailed

				I was turned onto SR by a trusted long-term friend and fellow psychonaut about this time last year, who had in turn been advised of its existence by a similar friend of his - think the Road had been up and running for around 6 months.&nbsp; Outta 5 of us only 2 have the technical savvy to anonymously purchase BTCs, wash/tumble the BTCs acquired and use PGP to encrypt all sensitive data.&nbsp; But we split the deliveries between all our addresses as its generally accepted we spread the risk communally. <br /><br />But other than that - wouldn&#039;t even admit knowledge of it to anyone else, or maybe a vague &quot;isn&#039;t that some kinda black market on a part of the internet you need to be a hacker to even get anywhere near it&quot;, then quickly change the subject.<br /><br />Plausible deniability has to operate around your own discretion - if your neighbours know your a stoner, or bounce around full of it, you&#039;ll have a much harder time denying the delivery that&#039;s addressed to you if it goes shit-shaped.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I have not told a soul about SR. And I never will. Most people are not ready for it. I agree with the previous user: &quot;first rule of fight club, never talk about fight club&quot; Yeah, I believe its exactly like that. It is that important. SR will go down in history and is too important to compromise it with casual talk with potential idiots, LE or big mouths. Loose lips sink ships folks.<br /><br />My $0.02<br /><br />DOC

				nope, unless I was extremely close to a person. and even then only if they mentioned it to me first. too much of a stigma while this place is underground and (unfairly) associated with other aspect of the deep weeb. although it&#039;s unlikely to happen as none of my current mates would go to the police for something as lame as that I don&#039;t want anyone to have the opportunity to use it against me, were we to fall out or something.<br /><br />plus it&#039;s kind of fun making up outlandish stories about how I get these obscure drugs.

				I found this place on my own from lurking the deepweb before the cool kids were doing it. Watched it evolve then got with major players and dived in. I agree no one should be sharing this place unless its for someone like a cancer patient that needs more affordable/available meds or to broker a deal IRL when someone questions your ability to move said product. Even then you should only vaguely show them the marketplace under a second dummy account which all buyers and sellers should own a second dummy account anyway. Showing a heavy industry hitter this place scares most on a technology standpoint, and most are willing to let you front the &quot;risk&quot; if it can even be called that if your business is done correctly. This is how empires and hedge-fund owners are born. Find a key market and dominate it till you are content to cash out. There is so much room for competition on the road still that it is RIDICULOUS. I am by no means greedy (I actually donate most profits as I am fortunate enough to already be taken care of). I am waiting on a vendor to change the game in the Opiate market. That area&#039;s prices are RETARDED simply because addicts NEED that drug compared to others. I&#039;d much rather spread social evolution here and only make 5-10 dollars per sale and move 1000 orders a month knowing that I single-handedly destroyed the federal governments ability to keep a completely safe substance like mushrooms off the streets. Profit for the sake of profit isn&#039;t inherently evil, but most men just can&#039;t help themselves but become evil once they&#039;ve seen that kind of money.<br /><br />-BV 8)

				It&#039;s funny. If it wasn&#039;t for my friend, I probably wouldn&#039;t have even known about this place. Yet they don&#039;t even know I use it as well as ANYONE else.

But thankfully I&#039;ve just slurred my words and there hasn&#039;t been any suspicion. Plus if you don&#039;t know about this place, WHO THE FUCK would ever think that you could go amazon shopping for drugs online?!? Thats a big LULz if I wasn&#039;t a slight computer nerd.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s just way safer to keep things to yourself. I feel like my friends would bother the hell out of me, &quot;could you order me this?&quot; &quot;that?&quot; &quot;show me how to do this?&quot; &quot;Could i just use your address?&quot;. Forget that, I&#039;d rather not even take a chance.&nbsp; Never a good idea to share with RL people that you ship drugs to your house!

				The short answer is no.<br /><br />The long answer is that I would only tell someone about the existence of SR under very strict conditions, namely that the person whom I divulged the information to is exactly like myself in the following respects:<br />a) &#039;omerta&#039; - an Italian word which more or less means &#039;code of silence&#039; - these persons do not cooperate with authorities in any way, wouldn&#039;t rat and would never divulge the existence of SR to anyone else.<br />b) they are responsible with their drug use (or if they sell, they sell responsibly and don&#039;t fuck anyone over)<br /><br />If I feel that anyone has the above qualities, then I would probably let them in on the secret. Otherwise, there is no way I am telling anyone. <br /><br />Unfortunately, most people are not like me and they like to blabber, telling all their friends about a wonderful website you can use to buy drugs. These kind of people are also the kind of people who generally cooperate with authorities and rat on others. If shit comes to shove, these people will become informants. In a just society, these people would be in prison, rather than the other way round.

				learning about SR changed my life.&nbsp; If someone who I considered a close friend knew about SR and kept it a secret and I found out and they were like &quot;yeah I knew for months but don&#039;t talk about fight club, right?&quot;&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t consider them a close friend anymore.&nbsp; I don&#039;t tell everyone I see, but I don&#039;t keep it a secret - I don&#039;t speak of it in a way that necessarily implys that I know anything past the fact that such a wonderful place exists.&nbsp; I heard about SR on npr, its not like its a secret or anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />telling friends about the road and telling them you are an active member of the road are different things.

As long as it&#039;s not some dumb ass kid opening his mouth to everyone then it&#039;s fine by me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>+1

				We have a group dealers around me that all know about SR. We have one person who is an importer and is fronted money for whatever the group of dealers want. It works out because the people that have stashes don&#039;t have to risk a package getting intercepted and we get products that would never normally be around. The customers are none the wiser just happy with the highest of quality of products.<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I think everyone should heed the warning loose lips sink ships. when i first discovered silk road i showed a few of my friends but they were skeptical and thought it was a scam EVEN after i explained the escrow they couldn&#039;t believe it and now they all forgot bout it. Now after receiving some packages my paranoid multiplied ten fold and now i dont tell anyone. At most some of my friends know i received a package in the mail but they dont know i get from silk road or that i still do. I also find friends willing to have packages sent to them i dont tell them bout the road but i do tell them whats being ship and what to do during a worst case scenario. i only think its fair.

So much fail EVERYWHERE on that idea. Lets just make it easier for law enforcement to monitor people that don&#039;t know you are snitching..... Plus just the fact that you admit to knowing about this place radar&#039;s you HARDCORE. Even if I was a dirty cop I would NEVER let off watching you from afar in case I needed a scapegoat or a good informant through extortion. You just need to turn off your computer and stop while you&#039;re not in jail. BTW did you know that 90% of statistics are made up?

				Even relatively tech savvy people get put off by things such as slow/intermittent page loading,&nbsp; acquiring bitcoin, using pgp etc. On top of the perceived risk off law enforcement or conman.<br /><br />If there is an easier route like a real life dealer or organizing a bit of what they want through a friend of a dealer they will take this option. They will just do something else on the computer with the time saved (eg work, games etc)

				ive told my close friends that sell drugs as well. i dont think of them as competition, i just enjoy spreading the love really. besides, simply telling someone about the road doesnt mean they will start using it. the average guy will look into the road and say fuck that im not downloading some web browser and using my real name to have drugs sent to my door.<br /><br />there is no reason to be worried if you told anyone in my opinion. as long as you dont tell someone young and stupid that you know will be impressed and &quot;spread the word&quot;, i think youll be okay.<br /><br />although i definitely think that people should refrain from showing someone about it without giving them all of the details because you dont want their fuck up in your hands...<br /><br />i think the test of simply being able to get on the road and using btc properly (without help from someone who has done it) is enough to prove that you are capable of using this site responsibly.<br /><br />who knows though, maybe im extremely wrong xD

				I think as long as you work within a network of trust, you&#039;re okay. If you have the kind of &quot;friends&quot; who are going to start tearing through your mail, or can&#039;t keep their mouths shut, are too ignorant to figure out how to work a computer, etc., well, sorry, guy but you need better friends.

				I get nervous every time I see an article about the Road. These things are best kept underground IMHO. The feel of the Road has changed and the membership seems younger. The standard of posts in these forums has deteriorated, I used to get involved in political and philosophical discussions and now I find myself responding to posts about feeding one&#039;s cat with LSD for a laugh.

				I told some friends about the Road before I actually started using it and told them of my intention of using it.<br /><br />Now I really regret having told them because now that they know they are a potential target of LE, and if they were questioned they might cave in and give evidence against me.<br /><br />Best policy is tell no one.

				One thing I have been curious about (and there may be a separate thread running on this topic) - how did any of us find out about SR?&nbsp; I found out about it reading an online article out of Wired.com &#039;s website. It gave the onion address (since changed) and stated, but not instructed, on usage of the TOR software.<br /><br />This may be a bit off-topic, but ketamine and small font don&#039;t mix well (comic relief).

I mean, yeah, I was amazed by it, but I was more interested in the deep web as a whole. I was bored as fuck. At the time, I had pretty much no experience with recreational drug use except for weed. Even with the weed, I wasn&#039;t a huge toker or anything at the time.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t actually care about it until months later, when I had first started dabbling in the world of drugs. Soon after that, I no longer wanted to be just a user, but I wanted to climb the ranks... be a dealer. Now I&#039;m part of this, what we call the game. Drugs are a huge part of my life. I love the way I live my life and wouldn&#039;t want it any other way (unless that other way means being rich and part of Taylor Gang :P).<br /><br />I&#039;ve always been fond of games, but this one is even better than GTA... ;D

				<br />Well I came across the road a while back, and was like &quot;cool&quot;, but I didn&#039;t like or understand the coin thing and it seemed like a mess trying to get so I passed. <br /><br />I had been getting Dutch pills to the U.S. on SR&#039;s 3rd ugly cousin Topix. I had a few good contacts in Europe that spent time over two weeks online with me to show me how to use pgp before I could order from them. They required wires or Liberty Reserve and the packaging was stealth most of the time. <br /><br />Fast forward to SR usage. I met a guy at a random EDM show and he had Dutch pills like me. He was like where&#039;d you get those? From the road? I said nah, I don&#039;t like to bother with coin. He was like WOW, so you know about it?&nbsp; Anyways, we got to know each other and partied and all, and he showed me how to get coin easy and I have been here ever since. <br /><br />He and I now go in on bulk buys together now and then. He doesn&#039;t tell his people and I haven&#039;t told mine. <br /><br />I did want to show a long time friend of mine the road due to him buying stuff from me, but he intelligently declined, saying he did not want to know or to have the temptation. I understood, and I have not brought SR up to anyone else, nor will I.

				I&#039;ve only told 2 trusted people who were going through the same bullshit like me with supply/quality/quantity of the street dealers..we had bought off topix &amp; alibaba before &amp; they knew not to tell anyone. I showed my mom(she&#039;s a stoner) telling her I&#039;d finally found the underground railroad for drugs &amp; she was amazed....the person who told me(heroin addict hacker friend of yrs) said tell noone but then i found like 5 youtube videos &amp; a hundreds of articles on how to get to SR?! i figured that this is where the smart people get the goods, if you want to find it you will...The dealers ask me where I get my shit &amp; I tell them i have an invisible drug lab in my house that makes it all happen.

				I had to tell a close friend about it, since we were putting our money together to buy some stuff, but other than that..NO<br /><br />some people I know guessed correctly that I got my stuff from silkroad, because they already knew about it (from their friends who ordered some good L on here).<br /><br />I don&#039;t tell people who I sell too, for obviously reasons, but its great hearing &quot;I&#039;ve done a lot of reagent tests, but I&#039;ve seriously never seen anything test like this before. Whoever or wherever you get your stuff from is just unbelievable. Keep getting it.&quot; <br /><br />This was about DA&#039;s mdma, which crackled, fizzled, and even smoked when it was tested.

				&nbsp; You are an idiot if you tell people you are committing multiple felonies. You give them the power to have you incarcerated . My grandfather told me when I was about 5 or 6 . &quot;Never commit a crime ,but if you have to commit a crime do it youself.
