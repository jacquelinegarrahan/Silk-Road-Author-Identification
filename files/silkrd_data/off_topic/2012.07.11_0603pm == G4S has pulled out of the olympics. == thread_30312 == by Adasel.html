				Yep.&nbsp; The private security firm that was going to help search bags, use sniffer dogs and what not at every single event to help the police, has pulled out at the last minute.<br />With police numbers stretched so thin already, the olympics is going to be a big sitting duck.

				LOL u guys.<br />Your both probably spot on.&nbsp; In comparison to american private security firms, ours must seem like right old mickey mouse outfits.<br />I think in this country its probably a lot easier to get a job in security than in the states.&nbsp; Most firms in the states probably require an ex-military background.&nbsp; I sure wouldnt mind a peek at some of our guys C.Vs !!

				LOL mate, so true.<br />This makes me wonder about how well protected our country is, think about it.&nbsp; Remember back when the police scrapped the height restriction for the force, and that you didnt have to have any particular background as they wanted to make up the numbers?.<br />How about when MI5 stopped recruiting people with high education, they even started posting jobs in the weekly local papers.<br />And, bullys special prize - the MI6 agent found murdered and shoved into a holdall bag.&nbsp; Basically put, all of our services are compromised and at risk.<br />Oh wait i almost forgot, the massive armed forces cut backs.&nbsp; Where will it end i wonder to myself. ::)
