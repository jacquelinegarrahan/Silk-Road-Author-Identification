				OK! <br /><br />The Republican primary is over in my State and all hope is yet again lost. So now it&#039;s time to get back to what is important like stretching the thresholds of my bodies ability to intoxicate itself. <br /><br />A friend and I are headed to the Gulf area beach in Florida for a week and I&#039;ve got a buddy down there with a valid address who is cool to take shipments so I won&#039;t have to take anything on the plane.<br /><br />Here are the restrictions: <br />1. Has to be all gone within a week among 3 grown ass men and 1 petite female<br />2. No dissociatives like Ketamine/MXE/PCP<br />3. No needle work<br />4. We&#039;ll call the budget $300-400<br /><br />Your set and setting is free house to stay in, beach within walking distance, car available, miles away from responsibilities.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is what I would take.<br /><br />1. MDMA<br />2. Shrooms<br />3. Xanax<br />4. Weed<br />5. Some 25i-NBOME because it&#039;s cheap and it&#039;s a pretty good high for what it is.<br />

				1. Weed (priority #1) - spend 1/3 - 1/4 on this<br />2. Coke - expensive, but lots of fun. I&#039;d spend about 1/4 on this.<br />3. MDMA - good for group settings like this, will get conversation flowing and not too expensive.<br />4. Oxycodone - good to take at night, but will knock you out. not much fun to take in groups really.<br />5. Some benzos for the comedown<br /><br />Get a little bit of all 5 and you will have a great vacation.<br />Alcohol is an obvious addition, but that goes without saying I&#039;m sure.

				This is a good thread! Nice thinking out the box Barb!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />1. Coooooooooooooaine!<br />2. Quality high grade Indica, like Northern Lights, Sour Diesal, or some Bluecheese if I&#039;m feeling it!<br />3. Melatonin, best thing for sleeps!<br />4. My KitchenAid blender, for my home made smoothies and soups, with added nutrient boosters, always respect your body, get nourishment, you&#039;ll live a better life for it!<br />5. My brain, because I am going to LOSE IT!<br />6. My keys and my phone LOL!<br /><br />Why? Because I don&#039;t want to end up like this guy!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT--h2GjaAU<br /><br />:D<br /><br />Added: Some rizla and some cones, depending on if I am too lazy to roll or not, damn it! Just like IRL, I always forget them! :P

				I don&#039;t think you can go for a beach holiday without considering mescaline. I&#039;d put it at the top of the list.<br /><br />1. Mescal<br />2. Cola<br />3. Benzos<br />4. MDMA <br />5. Some other RC. 2ce possibly

				Great; thanks for all in the input gents.<br /><br />The cart is looking like this so far:<br /><br />200mg MDMA Pink Question Marks (x4) <br />1000ug 25i-NBOMe (x10)<br />1g Amphetamine/Speed<br />3.5g 100% Indica<br />3.5g 80/20 Sativa Dominant<br />100mg Atenolol (x10) Beta Blocker<br /><br />Total: $235<br /><br />Need some more!!! What is the 2C compound that you top onto MDMA about 1.5hours in to really set it off? 2C-B?<br /><br />Also, would anyone be experienced enough to recommend those MindFood nootropics to preload the rolls to prevent the MDMA hangover?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;d highly suggest Mephedrone mate. As you&#039;re coming down from the MDMA, do a 100mg line of Mephedrone and it will bring you in to a new more stimulating roll. The good thing about Drone is that re-dosing works. With MDMA there&#039;s a point where taking more won&#039;t bring back the desirable effects, but with Drone they come back and back. <br /><br />If you do decide on Drone - take the MDMA first and Drone on the comedown, if you do Drone before the MDMA - the MDMA will have a lessened effect. If you do it on the peak of the MDMA, it will overpower it. So do it on the comedown and you will have a great time.
