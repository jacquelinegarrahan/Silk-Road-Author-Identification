				It all started this morning when I woke up for my second interview for a job that I was hopeful to start. My beloved soul mate sent me an inspiration boost of confidence via a text message, &quot;Good luck on your interview!!&quot;&nbsp; Needless to say, but I will say anyways that day already had a radiance of grandeur about it.<br /><br />I ventured on up to the apple laden decor kitchen to find my grandmother enjoying her warm cup of tea and newspaper although it was already 12:30 she seemed to still be indulging in the typical morning pleasures. She said to me casually, &quot;Here is some mail to you.&quot; Once she got to the word mail my eyes darted down frantically in excited to find what I hadn&#039;t been expecting to arrive later on that week. The label on it read from California, and this package I was receiving from the coast wasn&#039;t just any old package, but it was one containing two 1/4 pieces of paper perforated with an image an ancient dragons fiery left eye. I immediately rushed down the stairs sounding as if someone had been pummeled down them to queen sized bed and ripped it open in a hurry of anticipation to view this parcel. I immediately laid my eyes on the glassine stamp bag with a picture of a deep red English Bulldog on it. In layman&#039;s terms it was a good ole fashion dope bag that contained my two hits of the magical substance Lysergic Acid Diethylamide commonly referred to as lucy or acid. With these two blotters accompanied a note that encased several strips of young good looking nubile asian girls posed in the art of erotica. There was 7 girls on each of these strips and if you put each one these strips together on the reverse side it amassed whole girls that were the same ones mentioned previously. I am still unaware of what these contain, but the note cautioned me to only take one because they were strong and the author exclimated this fact by illustrating a face with a sick squiggly mouth, and wrote follow the spiral in spiraling letters, and I am unsure of what his intention was with these spiraling letters, but maybe it was that I was about to embark on a journey like the once Alice did.<br /><br />I looked at my wonderful parcels in a rush, because I was getting ready for the fabolous job interview, and I didn&#039;t care for my grandmother to see me with two potent hits of acid laden blotter, and strips of nubile asian girl pornography. She would of thought I was some drug and porn freak even though in reality that encompasses a small fraction of me, but not the fraction any grandson wants his elderly grandmother to see.<br /><br />I carefully wrapped up the parcels and neatly put them in my top drawer along with my freshly dried psilocybin mushrooms, because that is the typical hiding spot of any young person I presume. I then washed up and kept in communication with my life partner through text messages, and ate some breakfast and went to conquer the job interview with my cunning mind, handsome looks, and boyish charm. I prevailed of course, but that is a different story.<br /><br />After the interview I spent time with my soul mate, life partner, and wonderful girlfriend, but future to be wife Robin; she is a petite latino/caucasion radiantly gorgeous girl that freshly turned 20. We did our normal routine of hanging out out her house, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it, but had this clawing sensation at the back of my mind that turned out to be curiosity creeping its way around my brain and playing with my mind like a cat with a pinch of catnip, so I ended up leaving early than usual to satisfy my curious nature of me that I sometimes call Whisker&#039;s.<br /><br />When I got back to my grandmothers I swiftly ran to the basement with my feet abusing every step with my anticipation to break my LSD virginity, and blow my mind wind open. I went in my drawer and grabbed the glassine dope bag with my dragon eye hits and through both of them underneath my salivating tongue, because being a person that adequately knowledgeable in the route of administration of drugs I knew that underneath my tongue is a very good place for chemicals to absorb quickly through my membranes into my circulatory system to reach my brain in the quickest and most effcient method besides intravenous or rectal administration, which neither I felt like pursuing at the time.<br /><br />Once it entered my mouth I expected a bitter taste, or maybe metallic, but I tasted absolutely nothing at all and from what my mind has inquired through research is that is exactly what I want to taste with good clean LSD. Sometimes the absence of anything can tell you all about everything.<br /><br />I waited around for it to kick in and piddled with my miniature black opalescent laptop computer and my Xbox 360 that had been arduously trying to download Resident Evil 5 for the past 24 hours, and was getting me very irritated at its futility. At the 20 minute mark I could feel this slight sensation I knew something was going on in my body, but couldn&#039;t quite pin point it yet.<br /><br />I decided to using my 360&#039;s media application NetFlix and find something interesting to watch while I waited for the foreign chemical to kick in. I was scrolling through the broad variety of movies and shows trying to find a documentary on Bhuddha, but it was as if NetFlix had other plans and presented to me Alex Grey, and psychedelic artist that used LSD flagrantly that I have heard of and knew many of his art pieces where printed on perforated blotter known as Blotter Art, and actual pieces of blotter that where still art, but art to be ingested because it was laid with crystalline LSD.<br /><br />As I began watching Alex Grey talk I could sense in him a very divine spirit just by the way he carries himself with his soft, but intellectual speech and wide array of words that he used like an militias arsenal to vocalize what each one of his art pieces where about. I remember specifically being envious of all the sage words of wisdom that where dancing off his lips. I thought to myself, &quot;How could one have all these great qualities, and essentially be so perfect in everything he does?&quot; I started to analyze every little thing he was saying, and process it like I have never processed anything before. I was now for sure I was under the influence of the acid, because there had been a battle in my debating if I was really feeling it or if I was feeling my minds placebo.<br /><br />His words became not words anymore, but they rang through my mind and took shape of vibrant colors and pictures. I no longer heard what this man was saying anymore, but internally visualized it with 1080p mental acuity. He was going on talking about his artwork, that no longer was just art to me It was emotion, and had a story to it that carried depth that I would of never understood if I wasn&#039;t high.<br /><br />I remember specifically one part where there was two embracing couples, and their aura was shown in psychadelic colors and their minds where intertwined the the infinite symbol to show their never ending love and compassion for one and another. They transformed in my mind and symbolized my relationship with my girlfriend Robin, and it was so deep and emotionally moving to me that my eyes swelled up with tears of happiness and started rolling over the bottom eyelid like logs going over a waterfall.<br /><br />Everything I felt was magnified to the thousandth degree and then amplified by 10, but this high wasn&#039;t like the psilocybin mushroom high that is often confusing and very foggy like at points, but was very clear and crisp like a warm spring day right after the rain falls.<br /><br />The colors of the T.V. where no longer bond by the constraints of the television, but instead where free to jump off at me and spiral into my brain, and splatter on the walls with complex fractals of beautiful awe inspiring rainbow colors. I began to see my the shadow people that I thought where just only seen in my mushroom trips and decided they embodied the mushroom spirit, so didn&#039;t think they would show up here in my LSD trip, but they came marching with passion in all shapes and sizes. They would flex their muscles and show off for me, some of the shyer ones would just give me the piece sign and wave, many liked to dance as African Natives do, and some were feminine good looking with an aura of a middle eastern haram, then there are the mischevious ones that make silly ghostly faces trying in an attempt to scare me, but I already have come to know each and every one of these characters through my mushroom adventures, and knew they just like attention and that was their way of showing it. I am not sure what these beings are, but I know they have deep love for me, and watch over every aspect of my life. In Christian ideology they would be coined as guardian angel&#039;s.<br /><br />The fabric of life was no longer an invisible thing, but a pulsating visible aura that I could see and encompassed everything in my room. It was a grid of matrices strewn out through my basement, and would flow at its own will and tune that would show me where to go next.<br /><br />The Alex Grey documentary ended and left me speechless due to the beautiful art work and left my head visualizing all his art ejaculated throughout my room and mind. I craved something else that would invoke passion and new learning to my brain, because it now had a thirst for everything that was knowledgeable that held my interest. I picked up my black Xbox controller that now reminded more of something Batman would have on his utility belt if he was a seasoned psychonaut instead of a diligent crime fighter due it having so much control and power over what I do on a daily basis, it seemed like a very necessary tool for the existence of this trip and where it would lead me to. I moved the joysticks in an upwardly motion until I cam upon the PBS show about Bhuddha who is a new interest of mine due to visualizing him in a profound mushroom trip, and feeling that his energy and my energy are one in the same, so in a form he lives inside of me.<br /><br />I began watching the documentary, and decided that is silly to watch a documentary about Siddhartha and his teachings when really I need to listen to the documentary, because the LSD was now shaping my mind and realizing things that seemed important before are of the least importance now. I closed my eyes and listened more intently than I have ever listened before and realized I didn&#039;t need to ever watch T.V. because my mind was processing everything I was hearing into the best visual sensation I have seen yet, and I thought &quot;This is what imagination use to be like before T.V. or this is how a child imagines everything that he hears.&quot; My brain began to flood with images of Bhudda sitting in one of his famous lotus positions with a golden aura radiating from his head and palm, and I could see the adventures that the lady was telling me about that Siddhartha went through to achieve his state of enlightenment. Not only was I seeing, but more importantly I was feeling his pain and struggle that he we would go through when he was eating only a single grain of rice a day, and starving his life of everything pleasurable to achieve his goal of being enlightened. Instead of being this normal mundane story I was able to immerse myself and live with Siddhartha and become a bodhhisattva with Bhuddha himself as he became one.<br /><br />My mind was filled with so much excitement I had to express it to my fellow shroomerite&#039;s (people of the shroomery forum), and at which point one of the seasoned acid trippers suggestion next time I go on a walk in nature. In my acid flooded mind this seemed absurd! I thought, &quot;Why next time, when time is here and now, so is nature, now is always the optimal time, and in fact it is the only time, so why would I wait?&quot;<br /><br />I immediately paused life with bhudda in a hurried fashion to go on this magical nature walk that I was suggested. I got up in my nakedness and put on my Cartman in a cop outfit pajamas riding a tricycle that foreshadowed an event that was soon to happen. Next, where my favorite expensive designer David Bitton jeans that I accidentally added my own design by ripping an L shaped tear in the left thigh and re-patching it. After that it was time for the top layer of the outfit that included my plain white XL shirt that I got to fit in with my African American friends that was layered with a charcoal black long sleeved tight fitted shirt. I put a normal blue work hoodie on and my favorite wool coat that looks very sophisticated, and reminds me of something in GQ magazine or what a Wall Street broker would dress in. My attire was complete now, besides my shoes, and I just chose a pair of old raggedy white and blue Nike golf cleats that looked like tennis shoes to go embark on my night time adventure.<br /><br />I stepped out the door and noticed the air was very damp from the rain, and could smell the crisp unique scent of fresh rain and decaying leaves on this unusually warm day on December 20th. I felt like it was almost magical that I had gotten this acid on this day, and this was the most perfect day for me to be blessed with this experience, and then stumble outside on such an unusually warm winter night to enjoy my first walk with Lucy.<br /><br />The roads where completely dead with any signs of people. It was almost like I had the whole town to myself on this magical night. I never got to view the beauty of the town like this without all my normal filters in my brain that take so much of the beauty that is really right out the window, because I usually see dumb little town, but not tonight.<br /><br />I headed toward the armory and usually I have so much fear of the cops and people that I don&#039;t ever go outside in public in the area, but now it felt like virgin ground, and I had zero anxiety about the police even though I knew they where bound to stop me.<br /><br />With every walk I heard my foot steps in a manner that is not conceivable by any ordinary mind. The rain fell and it was no longer hearing rain drops, but now I heard every rain drop, and got to enjoy each and everyone individually instead of all at once. The storm drains plain beautiful music with the their raindrops, and the background of the swooshing water. I would stand there and listen to its rhythm and regretted that I miss out on such great music made by nature. I could hear everything all at once and individually simultaneously.<br /><br />The sights where like no other before, the roads down to the elementary school where enchanted and magical as if they popped right out of a ferry tale. They where gleaming with the fresh rain that splattered the ground and made it look like fresh wet candy paint job with all the vibrant cool blue, electric green, and candy apple red colors of the Christmas lights melted into the pavement from the neighboring houses. My eyes where now virgins again and they where being raped by the beauty that is right out my back door that my mind has failed to see before.<br /><br />I would look up and feel every raindrop hit my face, and with the splatter of each one it would send an orgasmic sensation through my body and make me giggle like a child, because it felt so cool that I was able to experience every minute detail of that raindrop shattering on my face with its life lubricating hydrogen and oxygen molecules that made life so possible.<br /><br />On my journey home from this glorious adventure that I had just partaken in I was walking down the hill will my fingers interlaced in front of me on my woolen jacket feeling much like a general in the form Soviet Union and I saw a fabolous tree in front of the home detention officers house and decided to take note of how grand it was with all of its experience that I could see weathered into the tree by knotholes and stubbs. I decided not to stay too long as to not attract unwanted attention, because I had not yet seen anyone tonight and didn&#039;t want to anger anyone by basking in the glory of their gnarly tree.<br /><br />I was about to cross the road caddy corner of my grandmothers house when I noticed a pair of head lights, and I got the tingly sensation down the back up my spine that led all the way to the puckering of my rectum. It was Mr. Johnny Law and I knew it. I also knew this was going to happen tonight somehow, and prepared my mind adequately to handle such a situation.<br /><br />Being the small town police officer of the law, and me being the nemesis peace loving person on acid he had to check me out. He was doing a creeping stop, and rolled down his window and told me in his cop voice it was his duty to check me out, because apparently that is what happens now when you casually walk around late at night.<br /><br />I generously obliged the officer which I have met many of times, most recently while they where serving my friend his arrest warrant, and was glad it was one that seemed like a pretty easy going guy, and didn&#039;t have the staunch Mr. Badass ruin your day like some officers have. He was a short five foot six inch young officer with a butt chin and chestnut hair gelled to be stylish and youthful, because I could tell he was in good shape and still in his late 30&#039;s, but trying to hold onto being young attractive and hip, which besides from being an officer I would say he achieved that.<br /><br />He exited his vehicle and patted me down, because I must have stricken fear in him, or maybe he wanted to touch me, because he admired my good looks and needed a better inspection, and I had not even a wallet on me, because I didn&#039;t need anything for an acid walk but clothes apt for the weather. I explained to the officer that I was going back to my grandmothers, and just enjoying a late night walk, because this would be one of the last good nights of the year, and I wanted to take advantage of that. He let me know that everything was fine and he just had to run a check on me.<br /><br />While he was running his &quot;check&quot; (small town he knows me very well, and there isn&#039;t much to check out) I was trying not to smile too much, because I was so happy at the beauty of life and laughing inside at the irony of me being on my acid walk and him stopping me. It seemed like it fit together all so perfectly on the perfect night. It made sense in my head, so I was not offended at all that he checked me out, and the walk wouldn&#039;t of felt complete if he wouldn&#039;t of. I was the &quot;bad guy&quot; and he was the &quot;good guy&quot; making sure that acid heads like myself aren&#039;t running a muck in his town, and if they are they need to be checked out. I completely understood it all and was so happy to him, and felt love and compassion for this man, because he really thought he was doing good in some way, but I know he is just mistaken. I was the yin to his yang.<br /><br />After what felt like eternity clicking on in the wheels of my mind, he said I could go, so I wish him a happy shift and continued to walk to my grandmothers as he gracefully did a half U turn and stopped to make sure I was back in my cage.<br /><br />That is pretty much the night, I am starting to get tired and want to enjoy the rest of my trip as I have been writing for a few hours continuously now.
