				Hello! I&#039;m fairly new to SR, as you can probably see by my 0 posts. Or one post, because I&#039;m not entirely certain threads count as posts.<br /><br />This post is basically oriented around one central message- What should I try first? Otherwise, it&#039;s basically just some sort of introductory type thread.<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to lie, I&#039;m a fucking kid. Below legal age for a driver&#039;s license, nonetheless. Older than 14 though, if that helps you guess. However, I&#039;m confident in my cognitive abilities (145 IQ, if that means a fucking thing), as I have spent many months utilizing the internet to learn, well, whatever I wanted to learn. <br /><br />I&#039;ve successfully grown marijuana, I&#039;ve been dealing drugs for the past year up until last month (mediocre weed, hydrocodone, xanax, cocaine for a month) and have turned a decent profit from it. However, in my shortsightedness, I bought a fucking computer, along with accessories, you know, general entertainment bullshit. Now I&#039;m broke again, have no way of getting to my customers/suppliers due to recent developments, and generally bored with my current situation. So, back to the question- What should I try first?<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in everything. I&#039;ve tried the basic stuff that&#039;s easily obtainable around here, but there&#039;s such a minute selection hereabouts that it doesn&#039;t amount to much.<br /><br />My frontrunners are- LSD, 2C-B, MDMA, psilocybin, and DMT. I&#039;ve tried none of them. Ibogain is also interesting, but too pricey for me in my current situation. I make money fairly frequently, well, at every opportunity I get, but I doubt I&#039;ll be going much over 20 bitcoins at once, so there&#039;s that. <br /><br />tl;dr- Want to learn of some drugs that are generally enjoyable. Bonus points to drugs for &quot;spiritual&quot;/intellectual enrichment, general perception-changers included. However, it&#039;s pretty much just, tell me about drugs you&#039;d think a sprightly youth would enjoy.<br /><br />Also, don&#039;t tell me how I&#039;m going to stunt my mental development by doing drugs at this age, unless you can provide links related to some sort of study supporting your claim. I appreciate any input.<br /><br />Another also, shit, I want to make some friends. Want a friend? Message my ass, let&#039;s be friends. If you&#039;re a seller and you could give me some general advice, or pleasant conversation in general, I&#039;d love the shit out of you.<br /><br />Adieu, you sly bastards.

				since youre just a kid i am not going to suggest you do anything. however you obviously already are and plan to continue to do so.<br /><br />when youre 18: from your list i would definitely say lysergic acid diethylamide. certainly not just to get messed up on though mind you, you must respect the chemical and use it for the appropriate reasons under the correct setting. there would be better things to just get high and party. i believe mdma is too stressful on the serotonergic system, even neurotoxic, and would not recommend it, especially since you are still so young. basically psychedelics in general sound appropriate to your mentioned desires, mdma anyway. lsd definitely has been the most spiritual and enlightening of the experiences i have had. also some of the most interesting and enjoyable for me personally, along with mescaline which is unfortunately much more expensive. psilocin and dmt are definitely two worth experiencing as well, but first there is a lot to learn from the acid trip.<br /><br />welcome new traveler on the road, always looking for a new friend too. good luck and stay safe,<br />- miR<br />

				Greetings fellow new traveler.&nbsp; The purity and strength of the items on the road are (in general) a lot higher than what you&#039;d find on the street, so it&#039;s best to&nbsp; stick to what you know at first. If you&#039;re looking for spiritual &#039;enlightenment&#039;, and hope to achieve that through drug use, then you&#039;re sure to be disappointed, however,&nbsp; 2C-B generally takes me where I want to be, as far as psychedelics go :)<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />EDIT: Be sure to read up on harm reduction before using any of the &#039;hardcore&#039; psychedelics available on the road. Safety first and all that.

				I would recommend you abandon this account, make a new one, and try not to reveal so much personal information this time. Especially if you plan to vend at all.
