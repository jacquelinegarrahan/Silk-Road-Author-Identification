				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got her start when the war on drugs was near its strongest. It was a pathetic, senseless war. They say that&#039;s what sparked her idea to build the largest MDMA empire in history. She&#039;d sold a bit of weed in college, but once out of the academic bubble, risking freedom for money didn&#039;t sound appetizing. She never had much of a liking for money anyway. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But this empire wasn&#039;t for money. It was to improve lives. Save lives. With the war on drugs came adulterants far more dangerous than the original chemicals themselves. MDMA was notoriously dirty on the street. The vast array of cheap designer chemicals flooding the market successfully tempted countless unprincipled charlatans to misrepresent and harm. She wanted to do something about this.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few short years after her initial bout of planning, the pills began to appear. They sprung up nearly overnight. Someone told me once she spent one hundred thousand dollars sending samples around the globe to suppliers of every orientation. The note detailed that these—uncut and high quality (any and all tests welcomed)—pills, each with a unique ten-digit code printed on one face, could be individually confirmed for legitimacy on her website then marked consumed by the end user. And suppliers could, of course, contact her through secure email. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was dominating the market within six months. No one could prove the quality of a pill so readily and certainly before. Customers demanded her product from suppliers. Why risk your body with unidentifiable white powder?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remained on top. Countless tries to snag her resulted only in the prosecution of tight-mouthed inferiors. In case of her arrest, she no doubt had a hierarchy of potential replacements lined up. She had no need for a surplus of money, so she gave it away; millions upon millions each year to charities, research, any worthy cause. Her life spared no room for extravagance. She lived a pleasant and purposeful life.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics shown by the fifth year of her reign horrified and embarrassed the government. Under private regulation, the world was much safer. Related hospital visits and deaths were drastically reduced. They did not like this.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a couple more years they got her. Headlines erupted proclaiming a significant victory against the bad guys. She’s currently serving a life sentence. Her empire’s running strong with no end in sight. <br />

				I started writing a story, but true to form I gave up after the first paragraph... here it is&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I felt a bubbling pressure in my bowel accompanied by an instinctive urge to push, the sound ripped through the air like a dwarfish thunderstorm, before I was hit by a wave of relief I remember thinking how any insects that may be present in the shower chamber would be forgiven for thinking doomsday was upon them. Before the pitched ripple had time to cease its reverberation from the dark granite tiled walls I was struck by a powerful bouquet. The hot humid air in the cubicle had excited the atoms within the expelled effluvium, it hit the receptors in my nasal cavity with the shocking speed and force of&nbsp; a pyroclastic flow, seemingly retaining its original warmth. My disgust was quickly eclipsed intrigue, I took a slow lung of the fruity mist like it were the perfume of an attractive woman. Realising the nebulousness of this rare spice I lowered my head and crouched at the knees in an attempt to decrease my proximity from the source whilst taking some smaller inhalations on my descent. This fart was bliss.

				&nbsp;I wrote that short story about one of my farts after a drugs (inc. alcohol) binge. I was in a hot morning shower shaking like fuck, my heart palpitating and feeling extremely faint after a big bout of the shits, it was a hard time. I had been reading &#039;Altered Carbon&#039; by Richard K. Morgan and his extremely &#039;wordy&#039; style was stuck in my head, I guess he inspired my fart story (I hope they make a movie of that book).&nbsp; Writing it in my mind was the only way I could deal with such a hell-comedown, I was lmao in the shower half collapsing, I wrote it out on my computer soon as I had dried my crevice.&nbsp; :P
