				Hello folks welcome to my movie reviews. I been here a while and some times get bored with the other bull shit so I wanted to have another thread to just talk about these dam movies. All your opinions are welcome. Please vote and add your reviews.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lincoln<br />I gota say I love Daniel Day Lewis movies. My favorite one was Gangs of New York.<br />This one had Tommy Lee Jones. Who doesn&#039;t like Tommy Lee Jones? Lewis played the part of lincoln and this started out 4 years into the civil war. It wasn&#039;t about the war so much. It really skipped thru to the end of the war and went on to be about him getting the thirteenth amendment signed. It was a well directed movie and the actors did a great job but to me it was kind of boring being mostly about politics and that part of Lincoln&#039;s life all the way up to when he got shot. Lewis&#039;s performance really flattered old Honest Abe&#039;s ability to be cunning and influence the people around him to persuade them to his goals. There has been a lot of controversey as to the facts in this movie being wrong but I say &quot;who cares&quot;. I don&#039;t watch a movie and take it to the point of being a history lesson. Even learning shit in school fom books have been proven to be wrong or a little off. I mean I was not there so I don&#039;t really know except from hear-say right? <br /><br />I watch a movie for about the same reason i do drugs--for it&#039;s entertaining values. Both together are great along with GTA lol Anyway 3/5 for this one from me. I highly recommend it if you like Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. <br /><br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook<br />This movie gets a 4/5 from me. I have not saw a movie yet that I did not like with Brad Cooper. Again he plays a role with humor and drama that most everybody can relate to. In this one he plays a character who is going thru a hard time when his wife leaves him. His father is played by Robert De Niro who along with his mother ambush him by sending a girl into his life with a similair problem. Her husband had died and she had turned to a life of drunkenness and sluttiness. He had just gotten out of a luny hospital. His wife has a restraining order against him but he is still obsessed with her but the new girl does a great job of filling in the gap. <br /><br />This one is a real tear jerker for the chicks, A great date movie and good entertainment for the family. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Next up is Quentin Tarantino&#039;s Django Unchained. This one has a huge cast of top actors including Jamey Fox, Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Johnson, and Samuel Jackson. There are lots of others. This one is set back 2 years before the Civil war. Fox plays a slave who is freed by a bounty hunter. Together they ride thru out the old west collecting bounties for wanted crooks. <br /><br />This one has the familiar touch of Tarantino&#039;s satire like movies with all the special kinds of music he loves to include. It last dam near 3 hours and has lots of action and gore as such is his MO. I really liked Samuel Jackson&#039;s part of playing the House slave to Di Caprio being the master of a plantation in Mississippi. <br /><br />It didn&#039;t say but the way Don Johnson&#039;s part was played it put me in mind of him being Nathan Bedford Forrest. Django and Dr.King Shultz, the bounty hunter who freed him, rode together from Texas to Gatlinburg Tennessee looking for wanted outlaws and finally Djangos wife. They were separated at an auction. Lots of explosions, gunfire, and close up bloody splattering gunshots to the head and body in this one. I really like a lot of Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, the Kill Bills, and others but I would like to see him change up his style a bit. 3/5 for this spaghetti western<br /><br />what do you all think?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FLIGHT<br />When this movie started out I thought it was going to be a great drug movie. Denzel gave a great performance as usual. The beginning was awesome with him waking up with the naked stewardess. Is there anything more sexy then a naked woman drinking whiskey and smoking herb? <br /><br />Then it moves on to show the girl buying some dope and ODing. After that was the incredible plane landing feat done by Captain Denzel. What an incredibly directed segment of this movie. Watching him take control and fly inverted, with all the passengers getting sick and in awe with terror in their hearts was absolutely the best part of this film.<br /><br />After that it kind of went down hill from there with the captain waking up in the hospital with minor injuries. Even tho he saved all but 6 people with his flying procedures he is still faulted for the crash because of his blood test showing coke and alcohol in his system. Now the film goes into a rut being all about addiction.<br /><br />I have to give it a 2/5. It&#039;s starts like a BOSS but ends with a whimper. <br /><br />My next reviews will be Wreck It Ralph and Here Comes The Boom. I really liked Here Comes The Boom. Kevin James gives a great performance along with Joe Rogan, Henry Winkler, Zelma Hayek and others. This is a really entertaining film great for watching with the kids. I know it&#039;s a little unrealistic to see &quot;Doug&quot; defeat&nbsp; Ken Dietrick but it&#039;s still fun to watch.&nbsp; I give this one a 4/5 <br /><br />All comments are more then welcome. Has anyone seen any new movies lately? I will see a few more in the coming days. I just saw twilight part two of Breaking Dawn.

				The Lincoln movie was timed for the Obama re-election. Somehow, those really dumb Americans (and that group seems to dominate now), bought the whole Lincoln/Obama connection. And good old White Liberal Guilt, along with Voting Machine fraud and manipulation, a complicit media, and many double-dipper voters. (they vote in NYC, then again in Boca Raton Florida -you know who you are)<br /><br />Add to that, dead voters. Then the ones countless volunteers drive buses to mental hospitals to &quot;get out the vote&quot;&nbsp; Then go behind the curtain to &quot;help them&quot;. <br /><br />And you get an Obama 2nd term. With 18% Unemployment (real figures),&nbsp; Gas back to $4 a gallon.&nbsp; - Coming back this week. And a misery index worse than the last socialist liberal Jimmy Carter&#039;s unfortunate reign. <br /><br />The United States is FINISHED!<br /><br />See you in my scope, from a distance!<br /><br />Former citizen, now<br /><br />Sovereign Citizen now, <br /><br />Enjoy your Marxist President!

				Argo Movie Review<br /><br />This is based on the true events of when the hostage situation happened when Jimmy Carter was President. It was directed by Ben Afflict who also starred in it. This movie has a pretty good list of big name actors. It is suspenseful and heart warming and very dramatic. I don&#039;t know what I would do if I was in that situation. It was produced by George C looney and Ben Affect. They did a great job casting and directing this movie. It&#039;s not really a movie fit for the kids. It hasn&#039;t got a lot of bad scenes but there are a couple and kids would have a hard time understanding this movie.&nbsp; I&#039;d rate it a 3.5/5 because it&#039;s a little boring. I did not even recognize Ben Afflest until it was 20 minutes into it.<br />John Goodman does great in this but I am biased when it comes to John Goodman. I haven&#039;t seen a bad movie or show with him in it yet. He really helped the Rosanne show don&#039;t you all agree?<br /><br />Below is an exert from the internet movie data base (ClearWeb Link)<br /><br />The Storyline <br />In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However,<br />&nbsp;six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out <br />of the country. With few options, ex filtration expert Tony Mendez devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project<br />&nbsp;looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts,<br />&nbsp;Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security <br />forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves. Written <br />by Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1<br /><br />I got Miley Cyrus&#039;s So Undercover. Has anyone seen it yet? I&#039;ll write a review for it after I watch it. I think Miley is going to be an actress more so then a singer. The camera seems to favor her don&#039;t you all agree?<br /><br /><br />

				This is a cool thread op. I watched SLP without watching the trailer and the beginning was so confusing. I was really high and had no idea how the movie was going to fold. Wreck It Ralph was awesome, like someone already mentioned.

But it&#039;s so different from them that it&#039;s hard to compare. Awesome action, Javier Bardem is a badass, and they&#039;re not afraid to be original, but don&#039;t stray too far to keep the fans of the series happy. Better than Casino Royale, and miles better than Quantum of Solace. I&#039;d give it somewhere between an 8.7-9.1/10.. that ballpark.

				Argo is an awful Hollywood propaganda movie. It manages to turn a great moment of Iranian history, when the people got rid of the shah, a dictator installed by the CIA, who sold out the country, into a farce. Iranians are portrayed as animals on a rampage, while the staff from the US embassy, which was the real government and responsible for the misery of the Iranians, are shown as the good people *puke*. <br /><br />0/5 One of the worst movies I have ever watched..

				I always enjoyed the oo7 movies evr since the days of Sean Connery and Skyfall was great in my opinion. The villian was plaid by <br />&nbsp;Javier Bardem who did a wonderful job as a pychotic lunatic out to kill M. If you ever saw No Country For Old Men then you know <br />that he is one of the best in the business for playing the part of the evil mad man roles.Naomie Harris was added to the cast as <br />Eve, the new edition to the agency. She&#039;s very beautiful and plays the part beautifully. Daniel Craig has another awesome performance<br />as James Bond. I also enjoy just about all of Ralph Fiennes movies.<br /><br />Skyfall was full of action and energy just as all 007 movies are with twist and tricks along the whole time. It would seem that the<br />era of gizmoa and gadgets have stalled with this one as they use the internet as a way of intrigueing the watchers imagination more <br />than gadgetry. The ending is phenominol. I liked the part where Silva takes his teeth out and looks all deformed. It&#039;s also pretty cool<br />how he blowed that hole in the tunnel and then the subway came crashing down while Bond had to scurry quickly to safety.<br /><br />The beginning started off with an action packed chase which ended with 007 fighting a bad guy on the top of a moving train and being <br />followed by eve. She sped up and got in front of the train. Then purched up with her gun and scoped in on the two while they fought.<br />Taking her orders from M on the radio she is forced to take a half assed shot and hits Bond as the train is crossing a bridge. He falls<br />off the train and into the water under the bridge. The water carries him to a water fall where he falls and sinks to the bottom. <br />Thats when the music starts playing and the movie starts&nbsp; officially.<br /><br />I love bond flicks and with me and my memories of Sean Connery as the first James Bond I ever knew, there will be no better Bond. <br />I&#039;m sure it&#039;s the same with each generation as they see their first Bond movie. I would say the best gadget in this one is the car<br />that 007 switched into when he was keeping M safe from Silva. I guess it&#039;s the last time we will see Judi Dench in any 007 flicks<br />because M took a shot in the side and died. Before it went off 007 took another mission from Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) so I look <br />forward to that next 007 movie. 4/5 from me. Please share your opinions.<br /><br />Storyline from imdb.com<br />When Bond&#039;s latest assignment goes gravely wrong and agents around the world are exposed, MI6 is attacked forcing M to relocate <br />the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman <br />of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can<br />&nbsp;trust: Bond. 007 takes to the shadows - aided only by field agent, Eve (Naomie Harris) - following a trail to the mysterious <br />Silva (Javier Bardem), whose lethal and hidden motives have yet to reveal themselves.<br /><br />They gave it a 7.9 out of ten

				I saw &quot;The Master&quot; this weekend by Paul Thomas Anderson, who IMO, is one the greatest living directors.<br /><br />It was probably the most original, interesting, and unpredictable movie I&#039;ve ever seen. It was remarkably well shot -- simply beautiful. It was also a very challenging movie, it required your attention and absolute concentration. It wasn&#039;t pleasurable to watch in the normal sense. It was just very intricate and a extraordinarily well put together examination of a few very complex, multifaceted characters. It sifts through an amazing number of themes in it&#039;s runtime and is helped by an excellent score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead that&nbsp; brings out the vibrancy of the filming and acting. Truly a remarkable film. Not one to see too fucked up -- you&#039;ll need a clear head for this.<br /><br />Maybe takes the cake for best movie I&#039;ve seen this year in terms of skill taken to make it -- although Django Unchained was one of the most entertaining movies I&#039;ve ever seen, along with Seven Psychopathes. The Master is just a genre of it&#039;s own -- a &quot;master&quot;-piece. (I couldn&#039;t help myself)

It&#039;s a screener and has them words flash in it every 30 minutes? but it&#039;s a great copy and very watchable. I don&#039;t burn any more any ways. I just watch them then delete them. I&#039;ll look for &quot;The Master&quot;.&nbsp; So it changes scenes a lot like a Tarantino flick<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Identity Theft<br /><br />Hey guys Identity Theft was pretty good. A dam good family entertainment movie. It starts out with a woman played by&nbsp; Melissa McCarthy who calls Sandy Patterson and acts like she&#039;s a secretary from his insurance service and she claims to be needing more info for his account so like a dumb fuck he gives her everything and then it&#039;s full of action and adventure from there<br /><br />She&#039;s on permanent vacation using his name as her own She parties at clubs every night, buys expensive clothing and jewelry. She winds up getting 4 or 5 credit cards in his name. She makes her drivers license in her name. and she just ends up spending all his money carelessly. Did she think she would get away with it?<br /><br />They do a great job with casting. It has Jon Cho and Jon Favreau, Amanda Peet, and&nbsp; Morris Chestnut just to name a few. It was written pretty good reminds me of the folks that wrote Couples Retreat. I admit it that I love Jon Favreau flicks from the very first time I saw his performance as Rocky Marciano. I can&#039;t think of one where he ended up in a wheel chair at the end and he was married to Cameron Diaz? Well that movie was awesome but , then again, I am biased when it comes to Cameron Diaz. I just Love that lady. But anyway this movie gets a 3.5/5 from me.<br /><br />Sandy ends up having to go run down this woman who has already went to jail using his name and defaulted on enough loans to have the real Sandy wanted by the police. He finds her and has to fight with her for 30 minutes of the movie b4 they finally start clicking and getting along with each other to help each other. It&#039;s one of those feel good happy ending type movies but it&#039;s a great one for the family to watch because it&#039;s really funny. I feel for Jason Batman tho as he goes into a different era of his acting career. Have yo0u noticed that all the parts he get&#039;s lately are the middle classed average suit and tie type of character?&nbsp; Be on the lookout for him to have some type of different roles soon because I think he even knows that he nneds some new type of characters to play. The days of Teen Wolf 2 are fading for him<br /><br />What did you all think about this movie?<br /><br />imdb rated it a 5.9<br /><br />here is their storyline:<br />Mild-mannered businessman Sandy Patterson travels from Denver to Miami to confront the deceptively harmless-looking woman who has been living it up after stealing Sandy&#039;s identity

But honestly imho Django doesnt compare with pulp fiction or death proof or the kill bills but I like it better then the Dusk til Dawn(3/5) series. I&#039;d give pulp fiction a 5/5

				Would anyone be willing to be in a contest for movie reviews on this thread? It would be voted on by the community and not a voting committee like my other contest and that&#039;s because i would not be offering as high a reward for the winner. Maybe $5 bux and that&#039;s just to give a little back ya know? Plus these reviews are not going to be in a featured thread like my others that feature the reviewers name in the title along with the vendors and products. I just want to add a bit of fun here in this thread so tell everyone. Votes can be changed and there will be a 20 day time limit on a particular movie being reviewed. It can&#039;t be for any reviews for any movies obviously.

				Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis, Dylan McDermott, Dan Aykroyd and many more great actors and actresses star in this one. <br />imdb.com storyline<br />When Cam Brady (D-NC), a four-term Congressman, becomes a liability, the Motch brothers (think Koch brothers) recruit Marty Huggins, the son of a Republican heavy hitter, to run against him and be their vehicle to establish factories in the district that will import cheap Chinese labor. Trouble is, Marty is a lightweight, so his makeover falls to consultant Tim Wattley. The race tightens as Cam constantly shoots himself in the foot, while the prospect of winning also changes Marty and his family&#039;s dynamics. Meanwhile, Cam plays dirty, and Marty cottons on to the Moches&#039; grand plan. What options do the rich have to get their way?<br /><br />I give this one a 3/5. It came out just in time for the election. It doesn&#039;t hold a candle to Talledaga Nights and Zach Galifianakis plays the part of the opposing candidate to the incumbant Will Ferrell. He does a lot better in the Hangover imho. What do you guys thank of it? I liked Anchorman Ron Burgundy better than this one

				What an awesome movie 4/5 for this one that is somewhat a bit like &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;ve not seen a movie yet That I wont watch if it has Emma Stone. What a fucking beautiful young lady. I am biased because I adore her in that way that Malcolm X describes the word adore In the Spike Lee version. <br /><br />But this was a 4/5 worthy flick again she plays opposite of Ryan Gosling ( lucky motherfucker) which is an cop turned ex-cop and teams up with Josh Brolin who is charged with the task of taking down the king pin of California (Sean Penn) who plays an excellent role as the ruthless king pin. I would highly recommend this one it is very entertaining and there are a number of Grade A actors and actresses in it with lots of action and suspense. I&#039;ll never be able to get that picture of Emma Stone Laying on Top of Gosling&nbsp; in bed with the blanket covering them out of my memory. She will do very well in Hollywood that&#039;s for sure. I wish they had more pics of her on the Gangster Squad page at imdb.com. I&#039;m gonna watch this one again before I delete it.<br /><br />imdb.com Storyline<br /><br />In 1949, when gangster Mickey Cohen seems to have an iron grip of Los Angeles. And no one is willing or alive to testify against him. So Police Chief Parker decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen. He chooses Sgt. O&#039;Mara, a World War 2, vet to lead the unit. O&#039;Mara chooses 4 cops and asks another cop and WW2 vet, Jerry Wooters to join him but Wooters is not interested. But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen&#039;s people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen&#039;s organization. Cohen wonders a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it&#039;s the cops.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oz the Great and Powerful&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting ready to review this one. It has James Franco and Rachel Wiesz. Sounds like a great combo. I loved her in Constantine with Keanu Reeves and James Franco movies are always great. I&#039;ll never forget Pineapple Express with Seth Rogen

				Storyline from imdb.com<br /><br />Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. At first he thinks he&#039;s hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone&#039;s been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well<br /><br />I loved it. It has to be the best re-make of The Wizard of OZ yet that I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; Every bodies children should love this flick it&#039;a a truly great family movie.&nbsp; It has Tony Cox who does good in every thing he plays in. It has Michelle Williams who plays the Good Witch. Rachel Weisz does a great job playing the wicked witch who turns her sister, Mila Kunis,&nbsp; into the wicked witch with the same characteristics as the wicked witch from the original film. Like that one, this one starts off as a black and white. James Franco does an outstanding job playing the wizard after he ecscapes in a hot air balloon from the clutches of an angry boy friend and then gets wisp away in a tornado and winds up in OZ where he is dubbed as the wizard and takes on the task of saving OZ from the wicked sisters.<br /><br />I voted a 10/10 because this will be loved by all the kids and they did an outstanding job with the technology used to create this flick. Franco is a great actor. I liked him in the Spideman movies as well as The Green Hornet even tho his part in that one was short lived.<br /><br />All though the original OZ movie has lots of sentimental value this one is by far the best yet.<br /><br />

				Storyline from imdb.com<br /><br />A soldier returning from the war in Afghanistan uncovers a conspiracy involving the <br />intelligence services and a gang of drug dealers.<br /><br />The Veteran gets a 4/5 from me as it has lots of intrigue and suspence. Toby Kebbell does a good job playing the part <br />of the soldier who returns home from the Afganistan war to find another war going on amongst the CIA, the ISI, and<br />terrorist running drugs. The ending was very surprising to me as i did not expect it to end that way. If you get a chance <br />check it out it&#039;s pretty good. It&#039;s got Brian Cox who does another excellent role playing the part of the Top Dawg who<br />enlist the help of the soldier with getting in contact with his informant but it comes back to bite him on the ass.<br />

Anybody want to talk about &quot;Clockers&quot;?&nbsp; I guess I&#039;ve seen it ten or more times. It gets a 5/5 from me. Watching it now.

				What&#039;s your favorite part of this movie Blow? Is it the part where the dude is melting the coke to check it&#039;s melting point and he does some and says&quot; I can&#039;t feel my face&quot;?<br /><br />I kind of like the part when he flies to Mexico and and hands over 75,000 dollars to the man and takes all his weed and then has it setting under the Christmas tree. Yea Yea Yea no doubt that the weed in that movie is no where near as potent as today&#039;s weed. Columbian Gold my ass. Yea sure Columbian Gold was good weed back then but it still had no where near the THC content as today&#039;s medical marijuana.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in that movie and this may be my favorite part of all is when it&#039;s first coming on and &quot;Can&#039;t You Hear Me Knocking&quot; is playing and they are showing how the coke is made and when they poured out the paste under neath the heat lamps then scraped it up after it had dried. You can watch the whole movie here at youtube titties and all!&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwcumthbPnQ
