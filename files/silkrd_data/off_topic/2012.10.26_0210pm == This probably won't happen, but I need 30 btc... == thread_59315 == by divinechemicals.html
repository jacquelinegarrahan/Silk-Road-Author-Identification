				Yeah I know. The amount immediately turns people away. I don&#039;t know how to allay your fears, maybe my post count? I&#039;m obviously good for my word, but I understand if no one trusts me. Basically Bitinstant is down and I really really wanted to make an order today to get something on time. Now if Bitinstant comes back up today, you&#039;ll have your money back basically immediately. Otherwise, the longest you would have to wait is until Monday. If you want to make it as a gift code so you know I&#039;m not just taking it and running, I&#039;m totally okay with that. Please post here/PM me if you think you could do this. I will give you like all of the hugs, every one of them.

				Wasn&#039;t bitinstant down yesterday as well?&nbsp; WTF is up with that, are they still in &quot;remodeling&quot; mode, or whatever it was they had on the page yesterday?&nbsp; And is that possibly what&#039;s compelling folks to cash out and dropping the btc exchange rate...hope they&#039;re ok, as from what I gather that&#039;s how a lot of people get their coins
