				I&#039;m searching through a certain venders page because I&#039;m worried my product will not arrive and all I&#039;m reading is fucking pages and pages of finalizing early. All i want to see is 5/5 product received in x days or something of the sort. Just finalize early and WAIT to leave feedback until you actually get what your ordering. This is really annoying and not helping anyone.

				I am guessing a lot of the people who finalise early are repeat customers who know they will be refunded or get a resend. It shows confidence in a dealer but if you want the low down on any vendors then join the forums and do a search. <br /><br />I would not finalize early unless I had enough sales to make me certain that I&#039;d be resent if it never arrived. <br /><br />So although you want your package to come bear in mind sometimes you can wait and each seller has a guideline as to times expected for various continents. <br /><br />Annoying though finalizing early may seem its just buyers who have had a good record in delivery. Once they finalize that sale they have the option to say something and all they can say is finalizing early or FE!<br /><br />I too like to see comments that say &#039;came quick, well packaged, gear was dynamite&#039;. <br /><br />But if you research the forums your going to find a lot more there.<br /><br />Hope your not waiting too long.

				I definitely research the forums heavily, I really like it here. Its just that there is really no point in saying FE since the seller can&#039;t even see who posts it so kissing his ass is pointless. The only people that post on these boards usually is &quot;hey I didn&#039;t get my package its been x days&quot; I don&#039;t often see (unless its a new vender) people saying horray my 3rd buy and it came in x days. Lately this certain dealer has been having alot of issues (seemingly) with his packages and I really hope mine gets here by saturday. I go to his forum and its just a bunch of whiners. This is were his product page should come in handy but its just pages and pages of FE trust this guy. Idc if you trust him and I&#039;m sure he doesn&#039;t either all we need to know is if you package gets there. They should just WAIT IT OUT no one is rushing them to post feedback and rate the vender.

				I disagree, <br /><br />for instance in recent cases of scamming, a dead give away has been pages upon pages of &quot;FE&quot;. If the customers are good about going back and editing, it gives you an idea of what their activity has been like lately. For instance AgentMulder went from normal reviews to literally all &quot;FE&quot; comments, this with a couple other factors definitely raised some red flags and surely saved some people from being scammed.

I don&#039;t want you to put anything until you get your product. Just finalize early and don&#039;t fill out the feedback form until your actually have feedback to put in it.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to guess you are new and think that once you finalize you are required to put 5/5 and then write something, you don&#039;t. Just let it sit in your &quot;orders&quot; tab and when you receive the product you go back to it and then give them 5/5 and write something.

Most venders have pages and pages of FE its standard practice. What stops people from getting scammed is this blog where people discuss the tactics of venders. I don&#039;t recall anyone posting here saying they changed there mind about ordering because they saw so many FE posts because thats what EVERY venders product forum has who requires it.<br /><br />Its definitely much more of a red flag when you see the last order has a freshness of 20 days because all of those other people who FE didn&#039;t actually put FE and waited for their product to come to post feedback. Then you should be concerned because this vender has many transactions but for some reason the last rating was 20 days ago.

				Is this topic seriously getting me negative karma? What is wrong with wanted people to stop posting ridiculous &quot;feedback.&quot; I put it in quotes because its not feedback at all. I&#039;m open to the idea that I&#039;m wrong or missing the point will someone just explain it to me?

				Most vendors have a feedback thread in the rumor mill so you can check out there feedback there or simply use another vendor that doesn&#039;t make you FE.

				No I don&#039;t care about Finalizing early I trust this vender. People do not post very often on the forums when they receive the product. ESPECIALLY with the vender I&#039;m talking about his review page is just a bunch of bitching about not getting there shit and there are hundreds of transactions on his page just saying FE. I&#039;m assuming most people are getting there stuff and just not writing about it but why post feedback when you don&#039;t have feedback it fucks with the system we have here
