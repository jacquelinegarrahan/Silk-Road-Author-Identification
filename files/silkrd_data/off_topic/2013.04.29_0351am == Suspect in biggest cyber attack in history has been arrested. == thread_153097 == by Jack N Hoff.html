				A Dutch citizen arrested in northeast Spain on suspicion of launching what is described as the biggest cyber attack in internet history operated from a bunker and had a van capable of hacking into networks anywhere in the country, officials said on Sunday.<br /><br />The suspect traveled in Spain using his van &quot;as a mobile computing office, equipped with various antennas to scan frequencies,&quot; an Interior Ministry statement said.<br /><br />Agents arrested him on Thursday in the city of Granollers, 35 kilometres north of Barcelona, complying with a European arrest warrant issued by Dutch authorities.<br /><br />He is accused of attacking the Swiss-British anti-spam watchdog group Spamhaus which produces a blacklist of spammers, including those distributing ads for counterfeit Viagra and bogus weight-loss pills reaching the world&#039;s inboxes.<br />Advertisement<br /><br />The statement said officers uncovered the computer hacker&#039;s bunker, &quot;from where he even did interviews with different international media.&quot;<br /><br />The 35-year-old, whose birthplace was given as the western Dutch city of Alkmaar, was identified only by his initials: S.K.<br /><br />The statement said the suspect called himself a diplomat belonging to the &quot;Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Cyberbunker.&quot;<br /><br />Spanish police were alerted in March by Dutch authorities of large denial-of-service attacks being launched from Spain that were affecting internet servers in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the US These attacks culminated with a major onslaught on Spamhaus.<br /><br />The Netherlands National Prosecution Office described them as &quot;unprecedentedly serious attacks on the nonprofit organisation Spamhaus.&quot;<br /><br />The largest assault clocked in at 300 billion bits per second, according to San Francisco-based CloudFlare, which Spamhaus enlisted to help it weather the onslaught.<br /><br />The attack was later described by critics as a PR stunt for CloudFlare, but Spamhaus confirmed it was the biggest attack ever leveled at its operations.<br /><br />Denial-of-service attacks overwhelm a server with traffic, jamming it with incoming messages. Security experts measure the attacks in bits of data per second. Recent cyber attacks - such as the ones that caused persistent outages at US banking sites late last year - have tended to peak at 100 billion bits per second, one third the size of that experienced by Spamhaus.<br /><br />Netherlands, German, British and US police forces took part in the investigation leading to the arrest, Spain said.<br /><br />http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/suspect-in-biggest-cyber-attack-in-history-had-hack-van-bunker-20130429-2indy.html<br /><br />[qupte]The hacker&#039;s largest assault clocked in at 300 billion bits per second.[/quote]<br /><br />Well damn!
