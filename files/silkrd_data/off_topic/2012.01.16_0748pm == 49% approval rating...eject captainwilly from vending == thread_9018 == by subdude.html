				its very simple, captainwillys feedback from beginning to end is the feedback of a non vendor and needs to be ejected to the status of a buyer only. a vendor with a 49% approval rating is a stain on the quality direction SR needs to be heading in and i believe it wants to be heading in. i think after you show yourself of good standing or terrible standing you should have the door opened for you or have the door closed after being shown it.

				I disagree, he apparently is sending out all of the products now. The people are giving him 1/5 even though they received the product because its a month late. There was something wrong with his internet or something. I think he deserves a chance.

				Yea, his rating&#039;s going to mean that people are going to be very careful about ordering him, so the rating system will already give him what he deserves. Eventually he&#039;ll get such a poor reputation he&#039;ll likely give up if he really is that bad. I personally rarely use a vendor with less than 250 transactions or less than 95% positive feedback, so I think he&#039;ll have trouble selling anything more as it is.
