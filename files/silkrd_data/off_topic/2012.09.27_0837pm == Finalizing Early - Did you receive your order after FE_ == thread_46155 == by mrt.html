				I&#039;ve only FE&#039;d twice, both orders from davidd. First one came through (10g for $3xx) second one did not (20g for $5xx). Since I now have over 5 orders I don&#039;t feel obligated to FE, but I won&#039;t ever do it again. It was a shitty feeling not knowing if I practically handed money over to a stranger on the internet.

				It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s&nbsp;a trusted vendor or not, I learned the hard way.<br /><br />I FE&#039;ed to: Trojan and Globaldealer, both highly trusted vendors.<br /><br />I got nothing! Not even a customs letter, weird thing that all other orders<br />that I didn&#039;t FE showed up as expected. Just not the two that I FE&#039;ed.<br /><br />Staff should close all seller&#039;s accounts that want you to FE.<br />Get rid of the scam, get rid of FE. It&#039;s that simple.<br /><br /><br />--<br />Mr.T<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve never FE&#039;d and probably never will. It&#039;s nothing against the vendors, it&#039;s just sound policy that keeps disappointments to a minimum on both sides.

				Five orders in so far, two of them were FE. One of those FE&#039;s is still in transit, though it&#039;s with a very reputable seller on the board so I&#039;m not worried.&nbsp; The other FE came through without any problems.

				I have F.Ed Once as a noob to attain legit status. After my 4 transcation I was in the clear. I have f.ed for some other vendors. But these are people that I have a good Standing relationship with. People I have dealt with on numberous occassion, and have been hooked up handsomely for it. Now if you are new, YES please stay Domestic. Until you build up a rep, or status. Also how long have you waited for your international order, I know its out the country because you sayed customs. They take longer alot longer.
