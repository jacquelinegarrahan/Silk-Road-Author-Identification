				Hey Sr, i was just wondering how the experience of heroin and other opioids compares to actual opium, and if it would be worth looking into.&nbsp; I know it is a lot less potent, but i have been relatively clean off opioids for a while so tolerance should not be an issue. Also where would i be able to find some good opium, the one on sr right now looks kinda iffy.

				I was over, well, near thailand, and had been getting great heroin, but had always had that &#039;thing&#039; about opium, and definitely wanted to try it out...me and my buds got some, they westerners called it grease or licorice opium, I forget, but it was available.<br /><br />Mostly it just put me into this half-dreamy sleep, reminded me a bit of nodding on heroin, or of doing to much methadone...<br /><br />Honestly, I didn&#039;t care for it all that much, but I don&#039;t like nodding either, and I mostly love the rush of good H, so it wasn&#039;t for me.&nbsp; A lot of people grow poppies, and drink the tea, and they like that a lot...<br /><br />A good site for lots of info on opium and opiates in general is opiophile.org.&nbsp; The have mixed feelings about SR, but that&#039;s cool...hell, so do I ;)<br /><br />Best wishes...opium to me was a really exotic thing I just *had* to try, so I understand...I do wish they still had opium dens around....but typical westerner, I like the refined modern opium products better ;)

				I too enjoy my H, and tend to do it IV. However i&#039;ve been considering buying and trying some O, but i don&#039;t know if i&#039;d be wasting my money because of my IV&#039;d H history??<br /><br />Any further input on this would be greatly appreciated :)<br /><br />Can O be IV&#039;d at all? I&#039;ve read conflicting reports about this.......

				They are basically the same thing. Opium is to H as white wine is to Whiskey.
