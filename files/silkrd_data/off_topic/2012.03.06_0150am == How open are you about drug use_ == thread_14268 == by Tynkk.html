				Just out of curiosity, do you tell people around you or is it something you keep private?<br />Pretty much everyone around me knows I smoke weed, and most of my closer friend circles know the other things I&#039;ve done.&nbsp; I&#039;m a fairly blunt/open person though, so I don&#039;t have a problem telling people or discussing things freely for the most part, I figure people tend to have questions and I&#039;m slightly less biased than the anti-drug ads.&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; On the flip side, my boss does not know (the whole needing a paycheck thing kind of hinders the openness there) and neither do my parents (more out of respect for them).&nbsp; <br /><br />So, how much do you tell people?&nbsp; And how do you base that decision?&nbsp; :)

				Almost everyone I know (minus family members) knows that I have some drug history.&nbsp; Probably because most of them do, too.&nbsp; If anyone were to ask me if I had ever tried XYZ, I would almost certainly admit to it if I had, and I&#039;d tell that person honestly what I thought of my experiences with it.&nbsp; If it somehow comes up in conversation and isn&#039;t a direct question, I will probably still admit to having tried it.&nbsp; If people decide that they have a problem with me because of choices I&#039;ve made about experimenting with my brain chemistry, they can fuck right off.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Weed and alcohol idc who knows.<br /><br />But as for heroin and coke i only tell my closest friends (only like 4 people know i mess with the stuff). You&#039;d be surprised how friends would react if you told them you mess with the stuff. Even though you&#039;re the same person they just look at you completely differently.

				I live in a pretty small town. Everyone knows everyone. Were growing alot in size but the gossip is as rampant as a women&#039;s sewing circle. Out of a graduating class of about 340 people I was, as far as I know, the only one to quickly develop an IV addiction to Heroin. It started with coke, E, weed the normal party shit which a large group of us in high school indulged in. However, once I tried Oxycontin in the winter of 2009 I knew I had found my niche. Within a few months I was experimenting with Tar and within a few months of that I was IV&#039;ing and dealing. I was the black sheep of my friends and family. I didn&#039;t have a reason to care though. Who needs reasons when you have Heroin? lol. I brought my addiction to Glacier National Park where I worked for the summer of 10&#039; and got 10 or 20 co-workers, most of them foreigners, hooked on the shit as well. Came back to town in sept 2010 and quickly began peddling H again. Got arrested in February for possession w/ intent to distribute among other things and spent most of 11&#039; in prison and rehab. I can only imagine how quickly all this got around town. Got released at the end of Sept and have been keeping my nose clean 90% of the time. No more needles and no more Heroin. Doing great on probation and attending college.<br /><br />Needless to say, everywhere I go around town people know the extent of my drug use. Im trying to find a fuck to give but haven&#039;t been able to do so.

				I am from a liberal European place and a fairly alternative family.&nbsp; My dad was a low level dealer when he was at uni and my folks still smoke weed, do a bit of cocaine and have experimented with acid and heroin, gone through their respective speed and codeine addictions and got out.&nbsp; My Dad taught me to roll my first joint when I was 14.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why was I going to hide this shit?&nbsp; It&#039;s not wrong or bad, it&#039;s just me having a smoke or eating some thing, I never hurt anyone else and I enjoy it, so what?&nbsp; I never tried to hide anything (drug related), never did too much of anything either though.&nbsp; <br /><br />However I have ended up living in a fairly conservative part of S. America (love) and I recently found out that it&#039;s not such a good idea to let anybody know, there really are crazy people who think drugs are bad and after the police came looking for me I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll carry on so innocently.<br /><br />My wife&#039;s family all (the close relatives at least) know and quite a few people that I work with know, can&#039;t change that even if I wanted too.&nbsp; I have a couple of good friends here that I can get high with and they don&#039;t limit themselves without knowledge,&nbsp; with hindsight that&#039;s all you need.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found my IRL fellow psychonauts to share trips and act as sitters and I&#039;ve found this place.&nbsp; What more do I need, why should I tell anyone else?&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d love to spread the Gospel but I&#039;m not willing get put up on a cross for my beliefs.

				Nice thread. I feel like about the same as the op. I&#039;m pretty open about it. My parents know (heck I shared some of my acid with my dad) and some other members of my family(not all though) . But I generally tend to feel people out before I know if it&#039;s an OK subject to openly talk about. Some people you can just tell it&#039;s taboo. I say live and let live. And for some Ignorance is bliss, but i prefer open intellectual conversation. <br /><br />Oh yeah, if any one curious I&#039;ve done weed, E , LSD, coke. various phar. pills, shrooms( My fav.), meth(only once didn&#039;t like it).

				Im a pretty clean cut cat- most people dont even suspect I smoke bud- its not really until people hear the stories that theyre like ummm.&nbsp; Im pretty open about everything, but I usually try not to bring up drugs just because theres no real point in it being included in conversation.&nbsp; &nbsp;My family knows a smidge of my usage although my mom is convinced that I&#039;m always on pcp or crack or something- but its funny sometimes when somebody learns a little about my past and how confused they get because i apparently dont give that vibe- i kinda like it that way though- a bit of mystery

				At home I&#039;ve always been completely open about drug use, my parents gave me complete freedom from the age of 15/16 so I had nothing to rebel against and drugs have no &#039;shock value&#039; at home, it&#039;s just one small aspect of my life. I still go to festivals with my parents and family (they&#039;re all late middle aged, old heads from the early 70&#039;s) and indulge with them, though they rarely take chemicals these days. I&#039;m from a small town in the South West which probably has the one of the highest concentration of grow ops in the UK- completely respectable, professional people (school teachers, lawyers, doctors etc) grow and smoke, so it&#039;s a complete non-issue. <br /><br />I never talk about drugs to co-workers, it&#039;s only one part of my life and I have other interests which take higher priority. I certainly never boast about drug use or say what I took over the weekend. If I&#039;m asked about drug use, I&#039;m honest about it but to be honest it rarely comes up in conversation.<br /><br />All of my friends without exception buy, sell and take drugs so again it&#039;s a non-issue with them, most are otherwise upstanding, respectable, educated &#039;good citizens&#039; who just happen to enjoy smoking weed and taking drugs on Friday nights.<br /><br />My partner came from an overprotective, conservative family and had some pretty outrageous views on drugs when I met her. I was totally open with her from the start and a few weeks of total immersion in my social group one summer changed her opinions completely as she realised it just wasn&#039;t a big deal.

				Yes, I&#039;m open about it. My drug use is very mild compared to most. Smoke some weed here and there, take some psychedelics once in a blue moon, and that&#039;s pretty much it. Obviously if I&#039;m talking to someone against drug use, I won&#039;t mention it, but otherwise pretty much everyone in my family knows about my habits.

I feel like about the same as the op. I&#039;m pretty open about it. My parents know (heck I shared some of my acid with my dad) and some other members of my family(not all though) . But I generally tend to feel people out before I know if it&#039;s an OK subject to openly talk about. Some people you can just tell it&#039;s taboo. I say live and let live. And for some Ignorance is bliss, but i prefer open intellectual conversation. <br /><br />Oh yeah, if any one curious I&#039;ve done weed, E , LSD, coke. various phar. pills, shrooms( My fav.), meth(only once didn&#039;t like it). Always scared of H. IDK why.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow I wish I could be that open with my parents about my drug usage. I think they would freak out if they knew I have taken lsd there all into anti-drug propaganda(Been doing a lot of lsd lately lol)<br /><br />I have also been thinking about telling one of my closest friends that I have known for 5+ years about my lsd usage but I just don&#039;t know how to go about telling them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually my first time with LSD was right after I read your post about your first trip with the log(good stuff btw), done it once more after. going to candy-flip for the first time soon. Might even put a post about it here. In all reality my mom doesn&#039;t approve, but&nbsp; she doesn&#039;t condemn me for it either. When I mention to my dad I had just done the LSD, he said he hadn&#039;t tripped since he was 16, so I offered him some. He cool with it all, and just say be careful. Which I am I always am. Before putting any new substance into my body i do my homework. ;-)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				im totally open about it, i like to think that anyone who knows me will generally come and ask me first if theyre either just curious or going to take something new themselves, even with my boss at my last job i was totally open about what i did, my mentality was made clear from day one though, i come to work and i bust my arse so that i can afford to do drugs in my spare time, i dont let my personal life mess with my work so i dont expect work to mess with my free time.

I&#039;m a girl who can&#039;t find a guy that accepts it :) Someone should make a dating service for normal, healthy drug users!<br /><br />With regards to being open about my use, I&#039;m pretty open, I think. Most of my friends know except those from childhood that will go running to my parents. My mother knew but thinks I stopped - I had a small stint in a clinic for depression and they blamed my entire life problems on the fact I smoked a bit of weed etc and so I had to convince her I stopped so she&#039;d stop worrying.<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit of a drug information service for my friends. I always get calls, particularly about pills and weed, asking for advice. I like to think of myself as the friendly alternative to Frank (for anyone that knows of the UK &quot;talk to frank&quot; service). :)<br /><br />Also, the t-shirts are cool. I&#039;d definitely rock one if you made it in a girl fit :)

				I tell no one. Not even my partner, which I feel guilty about, but I don&#039;t do drugs regularly and it&#039;s not worth me being honest about because they just wouldn&#039;t understand.<br /><br />I used to be way too open about it, back when I was a teenager and didn&#039;t care about the consequences of my reputation or other people&#039;s judgement. I&#039;d smoke pot in the house, and come home from rave clubs quite obviously still messed up from Ecstasy pills. I don&#039;t behave this way anymore, and have &quot;cleaned up my act,&quot; so to speak. My family is very anti-drugs and still hold my past drug-use against me to this day. No matter how well I excel in other areas of my life, such as study or work, I will never live down my history and will always be perceived as the wayward, &quot;black sheep&quot; of the family.<br /><br />Hypocritically, my parents are bad alcoholics who are quite happy to enable my alcoholism and see nothing wrong with me binge-drinking several nights a week. I even got into a drink-driving accident once and they didn&#039;t seem too phased by it. If I were to smoke pot, however, my parents would look upon me with disgust and try to convince me that I&#039;m going to turn schizophrenic.<br /><br />Several years on, I now have to maintain an image of being a responsible, functioning adult. Otherwise, my family and close friends would complain and lecture me to no end and make my life a miserable Hell.<br /><br />On another note, sometimes friends lead me to believe they may be open to drug use due to their hobbies and interests, but I am then surprised to find out that they aren&#039;t. For example, I have a friend who loves the movie &#039;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#039;, but he has never used psychedelics and has no desire to do so. He just thinks the film is funny and likes the way it is written. I have another friend who is obsessed with researching about &quot;astral travel&quot; and &quot;out of body experiences,&quot; but when I talked to her about DMT and the pineal gland, she said &quot;No, these things should only be achieved naturally.&quot; People are very confusing and send mixed messages sometimes!

				I&#039;m open about the fact that I use substances, but I never disclose anything in specific- what, where, when, etc.<br /><br />The exceptions would be when I roll with friends, and we may even meet up with sober friends. I&#039;ll typically be open about rolling.<br />And when I drink; I wouldn&#039;t think to keep that a secret.

				I am totally open about me drug use and preference.I am a superintendent of an Apartment building and tell my tenants that what you do inside your Apt. is their business. But no smoking pot,hash,oil,Oxy&#039;s or crack in the halls as we have other tenants that condone the regular use of recreational drugs but these people are full time alcoholics (which is legal and worse for your body).Canada done a survet 3 yrs ago and 13 million people admitted to using pot that year/11 million admitted to using on a weekly basis/6 million admitted to using daily those are pretty good numbers of people that have admitted to using soon we will be free and then the world changes for good<br /><br />
