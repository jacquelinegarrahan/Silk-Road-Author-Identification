				To customers and SR vendor support:<br /><br />We&#039;re Purest, an SR vendor, and we&#039;ve been locked out of SR since Monday afternoon.<br /><br />Customers:<br />We are unsure when these problems will stop, just like everyone else. We can&#039;t access anything, including our money, order information, or anything else. If you have to get something NOW, please email us at purest@tormail.org. Orders will be process out of escrow, but we will provide a comprehensive contract guaranteeing delivery and provide you with DCN information. For less than the price of a gram with Priority shipping on SR (due to fees), we can ship you the same gram express mail as well, which includes a delivery guarantee within 2 days. To 3 customers who ordered and had product marked in transit Monday, we re-shipped 3 that were marked returned for additional postage when we checked transit during the week. They were re-shipped Thursday at 8:30, hopefully you have either gotten them by now or will Saturday. Sorry for the mix-up on that one. Customers who placed orders Monday afternoon or later: IF you are among the lucky few who are able to get in, please know that we will first be shipping ALL orders that are still open for us to ship AS SOON AS we can log in. We have no idea when SR will be fixed, if ever, so we just don&#039;t know when that will be. In the meantime if you are sick, please use our email service. No escrow, but a full guarantee.We&#039;re sorry for this bullshit, but keep in mind: it is not our fault. We have product, but we can&#039;t access orders, or even our money, an amount I hate to think about. Please direct your anger at SR.<br /><br />SR Vendor support:<br />Vendors pay for use of this service, the customers don&#039;t have to pay $150 to join, and although they pay fees, our products are where fees are levied, or taxed. We NEED to access the site to withdraw $$ for re-ups, etc. We would really like to be able to access the $$, but some folks might actually get killed if they can&#039;t get to it, especially if they front their stuff. You NEED to provide vendors with an alternate login url. There&#039;s just no way around it. We should be operating on a separate site that links only with product listings, etc. We must be able to access our orders consistently in real time, otherwise the site breaks down completely, and customers don&#039;t get product. You guys need to get this figured out. It&#039;s not like you couldn&#039;t have anticipated this growth as it began months ago with the publicity you got. Not having planned for this was irresponsible, so it&#039;s time to think outside of the box a bit and fix it QUICKLY. The solution is a bit complex, but it&#039;s just not that hard to set up. Just post the new vendor login url on the forums, we will all see the posting. Thanks!<br /><br />Best,<br />Purest

				Some advice on your money issues:<br />If the site comes back, configure the auto-withdrawl function somewhere in the account management. This way, all your coins will be sent automatically off of SR on the wallet you specified and you control. But yeah, doesn&#039;t help you much in the current situation :/

				lol u gotta lotta nerve buddy - u started flaking on ppl several weeks ago and sr admin had to refund everyone&#039;s orders bcuz u listed with no product<br /><br />then you did it again&nbsp; - no forum postings when those both happened, guess it slipped your mind<br /><br />now sr is having problems for everyone and you&#039;re like &#039; just send us&nbsp; money we promise we&#039;ll send you stuff &#039; - oh lol<br /><br />anyone sending you money at this point deserves to lose it - you already burned through your trust in this community - now it&#039;s pretty obvious what you&#039;re doing<br /><br />

				Yeah, Monday seems like a long time to us as well. We have been very patient, we feel, and waited quite a while before posting this, at this point we have to at least send a general message to our customers who have order that have not been marked &quot;in transit&quot;, so that they can cancel those orders if they are able to log in, and make other arrangements if they need to do so. We also know some folks really want to deal only with us, so we had to figure out a way to do that. Tormail isn&#039;t optimal, but it&#039;s an option for loyal customers who like dealing with us.<br /><br />To onepostchump: check our actual ratings once this technical stuff is over. We&#039;ve touched base with the 3 or 4 people IN TOTAL who were upset during our product shortage, and they&#039;ll be changing their feedback. Aside form that, take a look at our most recent feedback, and look at ALL of our feedback over time, which is all positive, and indicates very fast shipping and great quality. You&#039;ll see that we ony had 4 people TOTAL who got upset, and it was all around the ame time, the period we had a product shortage. We had promised a few re-ships, and we couldn&#039;t follow through then, because we didn&#039;t have anything to ship for a couple weeks. As I said,we&#039;ve contacted those folks, and have been re-shipping to those who had delivery issues or whatever else led to our agreement to either re-ship in full (1 case) or in part (1case) or do a partial refund (2 cases). All the situations were a little different, most involved USPS errors, but in no circumstance did we just steal from anyone. We are not assholes, and we really, really don&#039;t appreciate being lumped in with scam artists. We have lots of fans, and a total positive rating (in actual terms) of 96.5%, or 579/600 positive in total. Once we have gotten everything squared away on the re-ships and all that, we do expect to be back to a 100% rating. Doing what we&#039;ve done here has taken hard work, great product, and a strong effort on our part. You have probably never actually done business with us, if you had, you&#039;d be nicer. Most of our customers tell us that we&#039;re great to deal with, and tell us we have the best product in our main product category (heroin) on SR. Think about it, really, our log in information is visible on our profile. You can see if we are lying if you are able to log in. We&#039;re not. Also, any orders that we have not marked as &quot;in transit&quot; can be cancelled after a certain time period, or automatically are anyway. How does that benefit us, exactly? What do we have to gain from having a half pound of heroin right here on the table, orders in our order que, and not shipping product and marking the orders in transit? We get NOTHING out of it. Dude, what are you accusing us of, anyway? We only are making the tormail option available to folks we already do business with who like us and are happy with us. It&#039;s not an invitation open to the general community, really, we just don&#039;t want folks getting sick. We&#039;re heroin dealers, and days of shitty dope is expensive and makes you non-functional. We&#039;re just trying to help offer a solution to a selcet group we have no other way of reaching right now.<br /><br />

				yeah u had great feedback when u started out purest - a lot of ppl liked your product and service - then u listed when u didn&#039;t have product and a bunch of ppl got burned<br /><br />now you act like u care about your customers - how quickly u forgot about all of the ppl you led on when u didn&#039;t have product<br /><br />at best u are not ready for the big time - at best - but if that was the case u should have come on the forums and said exactly that - but u didn&#039;t do that now did you?<br /><br />all i read now is you doing damage control and CYA - and it&#039;s easy to see through<br /><br /><br />

				Onepost,<br /><br />Had to remove an earlier reply as it included too much personal, offline information which could result in security risks.<br /><br />We do care about our customers, that&#039;s no act! We have and are shipping the great product people like so much, and when the site is working correctly, our shipping times are fast and our response to any problem is rapid.<br /><br />We DID make a decision to stop our operation a couple weeks ago when complications delayed our re-up process. No customer got burned, every single person got their money back in full, that&#039;s how order cancellation works, it&#039;s automatic. The technical issues are separate. but as this comes right on the heels of our offline problems, I understand your &quot;misunderstanding&quot; to a certain degree. However, our re-started operation was going fine until this technical stuff, our reviews reflect that with recent, 5/5 finalizations.<br /><br />There really are only a couple choices when presented with the situation we had to deal with offline. One, ship inferior product to keep the ball rolling and the money coming in. Two, suspend operations, cancel orders and refund everyone&#039;s money in full. We are committed to supplying the best quality product, so we made a choice during an unusual, difficult time, to refund all buyers by cancelling orders rather than ship filler product. We stand by that decision as being the choice with the most integrity. It&#039;s what we would do offline, and we felt that it was the best move. Others may disagree. If you think that shipping no matter the quality would&#039;ve been more &quot;big time&quot;, than we&#039;re happy to be small time!<br /><br />The problems mentioned in this post are completely different, and relate mainly to our inability to access SR for technical reasons. Trying to use us as some sort of punching bag, possibly even making attacks for competitive reasons, is uncalled for. We are, and have been working hard to do the right thing for our customers. Now, we&#039;ve had everything possible go wrong that could have, it seems, but we feel that it&#039;s all part of learning and getting better as we transition to doing business online, which is a BIG change. We&#039;ll just keep trying to improve, and continue to prove ourselves. We are not going away.<br /><br />Best,<br />Purest
