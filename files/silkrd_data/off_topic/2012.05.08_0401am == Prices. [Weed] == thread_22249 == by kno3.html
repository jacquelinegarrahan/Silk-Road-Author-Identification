				I&#039;ve notice that weed is more expensive here than on the streets.&nbsp; I&#039;m a casual buyer and when I see 300+ for an oz of medical grade it drives me nuts.&nbsp; Not only are prices of decent vendors rising but theirs absolute crap being thrown on the list for the same price.&nbsp; Let&#039;s be honest, I&#039;m here because I want good weed at a GREAT deal.&nbsp; If SR doesn&#039;t have the price then who in their right mind would bother going through the process of BTC to save 20 bucks.&nbsp; Growers, what is your reason for charging unreasonable prices? Greed?<br /><br />I want honest answers or a damn good lie.

				1. Because the risk/reward is significantly higher than on the streets.<br />2. You pay for convenience.<br />3. People continually buy the overpriced products, causing the price to stay fixed.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re complaining about 300oz, just stick to buying off the streets. Where I&#039;m from, a cheap oz of fire would be in the 350 range. Hell, people around me buy oz&#039;s for 400-500 if it&#039;s some REALLY flame shit.

				Hi, i&#039;m a grower (but not a vendor yet), and whilst I agree with you that people charge way too much for weed in general, I&#039;m not sure why you think it should be cheaper here than &quot;on the street&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Selling on the street just involves throwing the weed in a bag and doing the deal for cash.&nbsp; Selling here involves packaging, shipping and fuel costs (to spread drops), as well as 14% for escrow and hedging to SR( less for larger orders, but still it adds up), and whatever % is needed to launder bitcoins into cash anonymously.

				The weed is far better on here than you would get on the street usually so it is worth it in my opinion, only works out at an extra 4 quid or so per gram so when you take into account the packaging and post and the travel the vendor has to do to post it, then it does not seem so bad.<br /><br />Also they get a % taken off them from SR, if they sold at £10 a gram then they would lose money for sure and render it pointless selling on here.

				im in the uk and an oz would cost me £280 - £340 ($450 - $550) and the lower end price will give me shit bud, and the top end aint half as good as what you get on SR. plus when you buy bud on the street you dont get the wide range of choice you get on SR. and it gets delivered straight to your door, you are paying not only for the bud but for the convenience. <br /><br />and do you know how much it costs to run a high pressure sodium bulb (witch you need to produce quality bud) i got a grow going on now and my electric bill is 10x what it normally is this month, so after i sell the weed i might just brake even :(

				I can get an &quot;oz&quot; of fire for £160 in UK. Not AAAA but defnitely not far off. BBut that &quot;oz&quot; is about 20 grams. Which puts the actual price for a real oz at about £220.<br /><br />Just like a streeth 8th is about 2.2g where I live. So at £20 per 2.2g thats about £9 a gram. Which means an actual 3.5 8th would cost £30+. And as I said that&#039;s not the AAAA, so I can see why people charge more. But even so, the UK weed vendors on here at the moment are taking the piss. Some of them are charging like £50 an 8th. I don&#039;t care how good the weed is, absolute maximum even taking into account if its AAAA and all the packaging costs etc should be about £42 an 8th. Now if you ask them they&#039;ll say &quot;well in UK cities you get people paying £50 an 8th for commercial shit blah blah&quot; but that&#039;s horseshit. The only people that buy off those guys are the people with no contacts or rich fucks that don&#039;t give a shit. Let&#039;s face it, weed isn&#039;t hard to grow, it&#039;s low risk (in the drug world at least) and the markup is absolutely ridiculous. So when I see them charging up to £50 an 8th it&#039;s just frustrating.<br /><br />However I&#039;ve been in talks with a guy on here who is gonna start selling UK - UK weed at more reasonable prices. About £32-35 an 8th I think which is a very good price.

				Here we generally pay $40 a 1/4 or 150 an Oz for half decent indoor.<br />If you want da bomb indoor though, you&#039;re going to pay 60-75 a 1/4 Oz though,&nbsp; 200-250 an Oz.<br />Canada has it&#039;s privileges.<br /><br />;)<br /><br />The only thing about weed here on SR, is you get a much wider variety to choose from.<br />I only wish more US sellers would ship to Canada so we could compare our methods/strains with our southern brothers.

				Im not quite sure what your talking about. There are many vendors on here selling top quality buds for under 300 a zip. What are you used to paying that you think this is such a sin? Send Nugz, Cannamed, Humboldtsfinest,Mrhumboldt, delta11,Sourdieselman, or bayareabudz a message, they all have great buds for ever greater prices. Maybe try buying in bulk too? An ounce to some of these growers is nothing, theyre not going to go out of there way and sell you an ounce at the price they sell would sell it to a dispensary(in bulk) it makes no since. If you want it that cheap maybe grow yourself.

I&#039;ve seen many people around my current area get busted for stealing electricity. It genuinely isn&#039;t worth it. <br /><br />If you have the capital, get some solar panels wired up to your grow mains. And use the grid as a drip feeder for when you need extra electricity. Alternatively you could just buy x amount of car batteries and have them alternating (i.e 25 in use, 25 being charged then swap). Charge them at buddies houses and pay them for their work and electricity. <br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah thanks is defo something worth thinking about :) and im looking falward to seeing your listings up, i will be buying some :)

Just pay your bill. Energy companies are far from stupid. That&#039;s how most people are caught!<br /><br />I will be posting up my UK stuff tomorrow guys! £32-£35 for 3.5g or £60-£65 for 7g!

				You also have to remember that SR takes 10% and packaging/shipping(vaccum seal bags/flat rate priority $6.15) So for an Ounce @ 300 Sr takes $30 + 7.50 in packaging/shipping. So the buyer is only getting 263. Not to mention fuel/time. When I started I thought it was much easier, but the hours of driving and shipping really do add up. Not to mention the federal crime you are committing.
