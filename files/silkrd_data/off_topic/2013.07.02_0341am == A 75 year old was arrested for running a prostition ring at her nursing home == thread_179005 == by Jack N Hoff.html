				Wish I had the lube contract for that place<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />And, I bet they sold Viagra.<br /><br />Still, I am big on helping the aged.<br /><br />Generally that means mowing lawn, not bringing them to orgasm.<br /><br />Maybe it might pay more than I earn now. But I&#039;d have to pretend to reach orgasm or have some little squirty bottle with salt laden wallpaper paste. Taste like the real thing, so they say, whoever says it! I never said it. I&#039;ve tasted my own in an accident of youth. Back when you would blind yourself with a bit of jism.<br /><br />Bit of funny thread I got to say.<br /><br />But ask yourself this, if you reach 70+, you will likely have needs still. Seems a bit wierd as nobody likes to think about their own grandmother actually even getting laid. But, sex is not just for young people! I want my dick to be working when I&#039;m 75. Noit sure if I&#039;d use it or if the missus would want it but I guess I&#039;d like to have the option. <br /><br />Wonder how much it was for an half and half?<br /><br />And imagine you were on the job and she has an heart attack or the wheels came off the wheelchair?<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Like I said.<br /><br />Funny thread!
