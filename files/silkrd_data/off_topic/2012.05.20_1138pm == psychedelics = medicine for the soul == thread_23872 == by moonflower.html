				anyone who is familiar with shamanism knows that psychedelics have incredible healing potential, but do any of you have personal experience with this? i ask because this is the path that&#039;s been chosen for me. to clarify, i have been sick for a decade. doctors are no help, as no one really understands it... and besides, western medicine isn&#039;t concerned with healing anyway. through psychedelics, i have overcome all my emotional issues (severe depression, ptsd, social anxiety, etc.) and now i&#039;m working on the physical aspect. i&#039;m learning more about my mind and body than i ever have before, and becoming aware of the root causes of my illness. i just wanted to express my gratitude. for without silk road, i would not be healing... what more could i ask for? peace and love to all my fellow travelers. :)

				There&#039;s a documentary on Ayahuasca on Vimeo where the guy talks about taking Ayahuasca and becoming a spirit and going inside and getting rid of his cancer (i think it was cancer).&nbsp; Before he did this ritual doctors told him he would die in 2 weeks.&nbsp; Really, really interesting documentary.&nbsp;

				Personally, I&#039;d say I&#039;ve really gotten to know my body better through using LSD and DMT. I wouldn&#039;t exactly say the drugs themselves have helped me medically, but they&#039;ve given me appreciation for life and the motivation to improve myself. I eat healthier, I exercise more, and I&#039;ve made some solid connections to those I love. If used with the right mindset, I honestly believe psychedelics have the power to heal both body and soul. :)

They are, at best, rough estimates of the effects that are being studied, but more often are merely multi-million dollar advertisements for pharmaceutical products intended to discourage legitimate criticism. In the US, pharmaceutical companies are allowed by the FDA to select the studies they would like to submit when a drug is being approved; out of 10 studies, the 2 that showed a positive effect may be published, and nobody would ever see the 8 studies that showed no effect or adverse effects. <br />As for mechanism of action, this usually amounts to testing whether or not the substance in question binds to the proteins being studied, and quantifying the changes in amounts of metabolites being studied. The mechanism of action is an idealized abstraction, which justifies names like &quot;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor&quot; or &quot;COX2 inhibitor&quot; or &quot;HMG-CoA reducatase inhibitor&quot; as if these were precisely targeted, surgical interventions rather than arbitrary compounds that were empirically determined to have certain effects.&nbsp; Every substance has innumerable effects on living systems, by binding to many sites on many proteins with varying affinities, and by reacting with other metabolites. They do not bind to a single &#039;receptor&#039; like a lock and key and then disappear having finished their job, as is implied or explicitly stated by pharmaceutical researchers. The reality almost never matches the theory; but that&#039;s not a problem for them, since anything that isn&#039;t explained by the mechanism of action becomes a &#039;side effect&#039;, even if it occurs more frequently than the desired effects. &#039;Skeptics&#039; who blindly praise modern medicine and denigrate anything they perceive as &#039;alternative&#039; vastly underestimate the role of drug advertising and biological dogma in constructing their mental realities, and it is they who spread (and have always spread) disinformation. <br /><br />That said, I haven&#039;t seen the documentary, and I&#039;m not exactly sure what&#039;s being proposed, but MHRB is inconceivably powerful, and saying its impossible because you don&#039;t know how it would work, or because it&#039;s not amenable to double-blind-placebo-controlled studies, is nothing more than an embellished appeal to ignorance.

That does not discount the possibility that in another set and setting, or with years of experience, the results may not be different.

				Good vibes, moonflower.<br /><br />I have psychedelics to thank for showing me how ridiculous the rat race is, a realization that counter-intuitively made me better at it than I was before. At the same time, it made me a lot less stressful about it.<br /><br />The net result, after a few years of turbulence, is that I work fewer hours, make more money and donate a good chunk of it to charitable institutions.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />MDMA was also very helpful in my life, as it helped me to understand emotions, mine and others&#039;, a lot better, and thus get along better with myself and my fellow mammals. I say &quot;mammals&quot; instead of just &quot;humans&quot; because after rolling with three cats and two dogs, you will gain a certain mastery of non-verbal communication that really helps getting along with all sorts of furry critters.
