				I personally find it amazing to be a part of such a secretive community but tight knit. True, drugs was the main reason I found out about SR, but actually seeing this place for real is fascinating. At first I thought it wasn&#039;t real. I didn&#039;t think it was possible for such a well organized Amazon for drugs to exist. Now that I found it, I feel somewhat proud to be a part of something that before seemed to be only fanciful to me. I&#039;m also here to buy some nice food. Food is good. I love food. <br /><br />G&#039;day all!<br /><br />OAS
