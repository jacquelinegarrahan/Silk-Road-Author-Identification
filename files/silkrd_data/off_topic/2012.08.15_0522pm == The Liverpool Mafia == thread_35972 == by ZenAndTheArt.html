				Just finished reading Powder Wars and Druglord: Guns, Powder and Pay-Offs. Man those guys are fucking legends! 8)<br />How Haase and Bennett managed to get an 18 year sentence reduced to around a year, and walk out with a royal pardon, all without turning supergrass! Yer, I know that they eventually got it revoked. I mean the balls to try such a thing.<br /><br />Druglord mentioned a time when Haase first got out of nick for the Transit gang blags (armed robberies) and Cocky Warren, as a favor, gave him a few Kg of coke to sell so Haase could have some money in his pocket and get back on his feet again. I wish I had mates like that! Has anyone read Cocky, wanted to know if it was a good read? Curtis Warren is another legend of the Liverpool Mafia. 8)<br /><br />

He was only caught in the end after the Police engaged in some very illegal bugging of his car as he popped across to France - well worth a read!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />
