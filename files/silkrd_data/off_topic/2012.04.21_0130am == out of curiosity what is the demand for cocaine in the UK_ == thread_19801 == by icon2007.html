				I don&#039;t do coke myself, but it&#039;s popular in my area.&nbsp; It seems to go down well with dealers and others who need to keep motivated.&nbsp; Most of the weed dealers I&#039;ve known prefer coke themselves.&nbsp; Taxi drivers are another potential market, from what I have seen in the past.<br /><br />Not sure about solicitors.&nbsp; We don&#039;t get many posh types round here.&nbsp; :D

				Thanks for getting back to me<br /><br />im guessing you will have to be in a particular society to sell cocaine then like it would be hard for a newbie to sell?

				- there&#039;s always a demand in uk, but doubt everyone have cash...<br />- as you know reputation is everything and you gen get from reliable sources<br />- as a nobody selling for the 1st time not sure who would take a chance when there are established vendors on the streets or SR...<br /><br />ok?!<br />

				Yeh most people love that kind of stuff...<br />Purity can be a bit of a problem though. If the stuff&#039;s good and you&#039;re willing to sell it within the uk, I wouldn&#039;t mind maybe getting quite a bit of you ( if you have quite a bit of stock.<br /><br />peace,<br />Big Monster x

				I&#039;d recommend checking out the sort of folks around financial institutions in the city, like bishopsgate area, looking into pubs/clubs on a Friday nights for groups of 20-30 year old guys with expensive watches, still wearing a suit, laughing really loudly.

				Demand for coke in the UK is quite high, all my friends do it, tends to be an older crowd (30+) as we&#039;re the ones who can afford to spend £70 - £80 on a gram of good stuff... Ive younger friends who brought some stuff for £40 and it was utter shit.. Not even coke (Probably Lidocaine or Benzocaine) <br /><br />Before SR I&#039;d regularly spend £150 for a couple of G&#039;s of good coke, that&#039;s last me and the misses all weekend, this shit &#039;party powder&#039; thats about, you could sniff an 8th in a night!

				Amongst my network demand for quality coke is high, but most people have given up ever getting hold of anything but crap. Most people I know who use it are younger people who perhaps don&#039;t know any better, much like me when I was young.<br />I last used coke over a year ago, and only a few times over the last 5-6 years. Looking to try some of the stuff here but like many other people I know I&#039;d never buy it off a street dealer. If i had a good supply I&#039;d probably use it about 7-8 times a year, good swag is too damn tasty.
