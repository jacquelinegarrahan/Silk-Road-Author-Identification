Technical things still remain male dominated - not that women cannot be good at it, its just a matter of interest. As for committing drug related offenses, the conviction statistics speak for themselves, although you could probably theorize that women are just much better at them and never get caught :D

Now, I don&#039;t explicitly follow that kind of news on the Road, so I could be wrong. But there is a disturbing trend of dishonesty, as far as those fellows go, from what I&#039;ve seen.. And speaking from the stance that they are selling something that can be life-ruiningly addicting, I get the feeling that it is a trend that will continue. Junkies need their fix and scamming is a great way to earn some extra cash.<br /><br />That&#039;s what is up my ass. Good on you to keep to that gangsta-attitude, though. Real top-class folks, them gangstas.

				I&#039;m female, and I can proudly say I was the first of my group of friends to work out SR, Bitcoin, PGP - as well as being the only girl in the immediate group. Then again I&#039;ve always been very good with technology. I explained everything to my mates, but only one of them actually made anything of it, the rest just prefer to give me a bit of extra cash to do the hard work for them. It&#039;s probably better that way, at least I&#039;m conscious of my own security.

				Nice to hear so many gals are giving it a go. <br /><br />I suppose this is to be expected though. The number of female students enrolling in &#039;typically male&#039; studies like informatics, math, physics and chemistry has been increasing over the last decade or two, and in fields like biology and chemistry reached a 1:1 ratio by now. I&#039;m not entirely sure what fueled this influx of females into sciences, but i believe it&#039;s a good thing. I don&#039;t believe there is some inherit reason women would not be good at sciences - perhaps its just a matter of being more acceptable in society in general.
