				i&#039;d try and find somewhere where the demand for it is high but the supply.. well that would be more towards the low end. when these conditions are both met it will all start to fall into place. or try fabric, officer. ministry? the womens institute? the british legion? no, creamfields. virtual dunce cap awarded.<br /><br />now if you could just help me out, i&#039;m planning to set fire to the houses of parliament. i got the gunpowder so like, if you could just tell me what to do next, i really need this shit down so i can gain the necessary confidence before executing the plan in 77 hours.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Damn, too easy dog, either your too young to start in the drug business or too old and missed your time, haha I&#039;m busting balls, at this time of year you would want to get your gear and hit up the festivals all over the country, but risk it hard, you feel me? The club scene is also good, you can walk away with good money each night, whilst dancing around and next to people and continuously say shit like many, molly, pills, X, but what if.....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Now you ready for the big one? Student accommodation, student halls, student town, basically anything that has the word student, you can peddle your shite. Students wanna get fucked up for as little as possible for as long as possible, mandy does just that and its becoming really popular these past couple of years....hmmmm.<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				If you&#039;re going to go with the student idea, locate some high quality amphetamine as well. It&#039;s cheap, long lasting and they love to study on that shit!&nbsp; :)

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Costello, additional input is always appreciated, but trust me, if a student could get high on fumes of urine, they would, I swear to god, what is happening to this generation of students, they will and do most drugs that didnt really exist or were as popular in my time, God damn, starting to think should have graduated in Chemistry. <br /><br /><br />Meerkovo
