I knew I would come back here though, but it was really hard. They made me get a sponsor and everyone was really really proud of me and had alot of confidence in me and I&#039;ve been home 2 days and have already relapsed thanks to a certain vendor with whom I&#039;m in LOVE who never ever lets me down and who I hope is alright. Rehab was really hard work, it was basically Alcoholics Anonymous bootcamp. 9 meetings a week, get a sponsor and get 60 phone numbers from people at meetings. It was pretty exhausting, I&#039;m so happy to be home.

				Hi lady, I never really interacted with you before but I KNOW who you ARE in relation to this internet based forum. I tried to order a meth pipe from you once but it was processing for five days so I cancelled. Last I remember you had to go to rehab or some shit. I guess that&#039;s over now.

				Yah, I totally stalked your posts to see when you came back. I have been absent from here as well for a few weeks.<br /><br />I made sure nobody forgot you when you were gone and linked your meth tutorial a few times ;) <br /><br />Good you are back. You were my favorite person to read reviews and check their posts.&nbsp; I honestly feel that I just saw a friend that was missing.
