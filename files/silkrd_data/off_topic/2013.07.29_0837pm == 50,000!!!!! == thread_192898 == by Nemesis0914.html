				It aint so!<br /><br />For one, you&#039;d be selling people who want MDMA another RC.<br /><br />That would be misadvertising. You&#039;d not last long here selling MDMA when its really methylone.<br /><br />And on the streets, it would be dangerous to mislead customers.<br /><br />In my area you&#039;d not last long.

				I would never misadventure on silk road, too much respect for it.&nbsp; But doesn&#039;t methylone have some of the same qualities as MDMA or the same high? Trust me there is some really bull shit goin around on the streets where im from. its not really as dangerous as you might think. I just want to know whether I could get away with it?

				sure, you can get away with it and probably make a lot of profit (maybe even the 50k you are talking about).<br />at least until something goes wrong, then your friends, customers and of course LE will grill your ass.<br />if you ask me it&#039;s a stupid idea, just beginning with the .8 part.how do you expect to build a reputation when you don&#039;t even sell real grams? does nobody around you have a scale? and of course you need a bit more than people who buy a g or 2 if you want to make the 50k in a reasonable time.<br />take an advice from an old offline dealer and newer SR to streets reseller: don&#039;t advertise wrong, don&#039;t mess with the amounts and treat your customers with the respect you expect from them and you can make a living of this shit (at least when dealing with weed,lsd,mdma,speed and coke)<br /><br />cheers

				that&#039;s even better. you&#039;ll be the only guy around who sells full grams of that new, PINK,(and cheaper?) xtc.;)<br />cut down your expectations to 30-35k (still not bad) and you&#039;ve got steady customers and a regular income without fucking somone over and everybody is happy (exept the fucktards who deal in your area)<br /><br />of course i know nothing about you and your surroundings,i have the luck to sell to a closed circle which makes a lot easier but also has its disadvantages, if you plan on selling in your local park or ghettostyle things are probably a bit different.<br /><br />cheers

				You&#039;re kind of a scumbag if you sell m1 as mdma. Combine that with selling .8 grams and you&#039;ve reached new heights of douchebaggery. <br /><br />If you&#039;re cool with then go for it I guess. That&#039;s a lot of grams...

OKay im quickly reconsidering my idea of selling m1 as MDMA, okay. I did hear the high is similar though.
