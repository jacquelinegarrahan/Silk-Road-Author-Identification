				I&#039;ve been looking through this forum and just cannot believe how much people bitch about pricing. I mean honestly you guys are lucky product is available to begin with. Obviously if you are sourcing here you either:<br /><br />A.) Prefer the convenience<br />B.) Don&#039;t have real life connections<br />C.) Don&#039;t want to deal with El Kilo<br /><br />I got an idea.... If you can get such good pricing, THEN GO OUT AND DO IT AND QUIT WHINING ON THE SR FORUMS. Just cause a hit of acid costed $3 once at a festival in 1978 doesn&#039;t mean that is the regular going rate. There is a lot of variables to this equation. Seriously there is nothing more annoying to a seller than people bitching about prices. You are dealing with an online drug store, that means paying a premium. I don&#039;t know if anyone has noticed but all these price bitching threads surely haven&#039;t lowered any prices on SR. If anything they have gone up. I find it even more ironic when they bitch about a product that only one vendor is offering. I mean some of you really have no business sense at all. If you want better prices, get to know your vendor. Maybe he will want to hook you up after he gets to know you, but until then you are just some random fuck on the internet. Why do you deserve a price cut?

				I for one am ok with paying slightly higher prices than you find on the street simply because I don&#039;t have to go look for it. I also am tired of people bitching about the prices, all the while saying that they can get it cheaper where they are from.... then why are they here? I know if I could just walk down the block and buy good quality acid any time of the day, any day of the week, with nobody knowing my real name, or any info about me, I would do it in an instant instead of bitching on an online forum about being overcharged with a currency that I can create with nothing but a little rise in my electric bill.... i lost my train of thought....must be this overpriced acid clouding my brain today!<br /><br />â™ <br />wretched

				@chronicpain Dude I hear that. With the products we sell, we get it the WORST. PMing me is not gonna make the mail come any quicker. I really try to never ignore a customer but if you send me 10 PMs in one day asking if your product is shipped, then sorry I&#039;m probably gonna ignore you. And you are totally right about the difficulty. People think &quot;They just have to package, ship and drop.&quot; Well a lot goes into packaging a product correctly, and it takes a long time. Multiply that by 20 or 30 a day and it becomes very, very time consuming and tedious. Packaging also becomes quite more expensive than people think! They also think we have little to no risk of LE involvement. Yes our risk may go down (if done correctly) but the consequences if caught go up. Next to every pack is crossing state lines and it automatically becomes federal, and not only that you know they want to bust the Silk Roaders to make an example. I won&#039;t even go into the defrauding the mail system part.<br /><br />@Calistoner Yeah I agree I don&#039;t think anyone has the right to overcharge, but you must charge what you must to make it worth it for you. Acid is probably the most varied drug as far as price goes, so I would consider it an exception since there really isn&#039;t a set price to over charge on. For instance, with weed you can bank on 50$ an eighth being the average. As far as who i would rather buy from it depends on the product I am wanting. If i wanted a product that I would probably only be buying one time, then I&#039;d go for the dude spreading the love. If I wanted a product that I would want consistently, I would go for the businessman because they are guaranteed to be more reliable, safer and careful. I have had dealers that fade away in a week and dealers that have been around for decades. Honestly the ones who lasted decades were businessmen.<br /><br />@F104 I disagree. Benzo and opiate users DEFINITELY need their drugs to function. But yes the second part I agree with.

				Heres my take on this; SR is to a degree, built for those of us that don&#039;t live near large urban areas where our mindblowing luxuries are easy to come by. Its built for those of us that live in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere. Expect to pay a premium, because there are no other sources. Additionally, many of our sellers ARE the chemists/growers, and so an uncut product is obviously costlier, despite not having to grease several middle men(which might be as to why the premium is SMALL and not double or more).<br /><br />my .02btc

				Clearly the pricing issue will reach it&#039;s own natural level, in some cases probably as good or better than F2F, like in high volume, high traffic items such as weed.&nbsp; LTTM seems to be setting the pace there so far.<br /><br />Other categories, like opiates, where the &quot;average&quot; user is *much* more bound to the daily intake and needs a continuous supply like they need water, will be a different situation.&nbsp; There will probably be other opiate sellers on here, but until there is a responsive, high volume, reasonably priced, opiate seller, the prices will NOT, in my humble opinion, come down.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have had a good deal of communication with envious and he was always respectful and, frankly, friendly and conversant.&nbsp; He was also always willing to offer a good price for an item if some kind of quantity was being purchased.&nbsp; Recognizing the extra effort needed to ship a lot of onesies and twosies is hard for a buyer to fathom unless they have been a seller before.&nbsp; Prior to MrDdro and chronicpain, envious was the *only* quantity supplier of opiates at the marketplace.&nbsp; An &quot;enviable&quot; (sorry, couldn&#039;t help it!) position but not one that would be enjoyed in any free market for too long.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any free market will always adjust pricing according to supply and demand.&nbsp; The forums don&#039;t really need either a lot of price bitching threads or threads against price bitching.&nbsp; Neither seems to accomplish its intended purpose, on that I think we&#039;d all pretty much agree.<br /><br />What the market needs is a couple of more good quantity, responsive, friendly opiate sellers, just like McDdro, chronicpain and even envious, in his un-pissedoffattheforum incarnation.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Besides just absolute price, there are a lot of considerations when you make a purchase.&nbsp; Some tangible and some intangible.&nbsp; A decent amount of competition would be good for everybody.&nbsp; But as opiates have a way, with buyers, of there never being enough, it may take a while for that equilibrium to be achieved here at SR.

Ahh nothing like a good debate... :)

				Because its connective tissue.<br /><br />We&nbsp; can use our intellect in combination with the coincidence factors in posts to determine it. When we have certain posters that only post to certain other users threads to back them up, and they have very low post counts, and this is consistently repeats, there is a very high likelihood its a shill/alt.<br /><br />Absolutely, KB and GC are very respectable when posting on those screen names, because those screen names represent the business and must keep a certain level professionalism, else it would negatively affect &quot;the business&quot;. Consumer perception and all...<br /><br />Absolutely, the extreme possibility exists that I am a shill for redtide, however if one goes back through forum history, I have absolutely no connective tissue on the forums other than this specific thread that even remotely insinuates a relationship.<br /><br />That&#039;s the difference, ergo, no connection at all.<br />

				buyers have every right to bitch about pricing, and the sellers who listen will get more business. maybe the sellers don&#039;t realize how overpriced they are. have you ever tried to negotiate a lower price for yourself? <br /><br />however, you bitching about other people bitching really has no place on the forum, IMO.

				So buyers have the right to bitch but sellers don&#039;t? Quite the double standard you impose there rtshredder.<br /><br />On another note, no matter what your pricing is you will never make everyone happy. I bring it back to my original point of: If you can find it cheaper elsewhere, why not just buy it there instead of complaining on a forum?<br /><br />I&#039;m not concerned about business or I would not have started this thread in the first place. Worst case scenario I piss everyone on SR off and sell them on the street in a day.

				Dude just don&#039;t click the posts.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had anyone bitch about my prices but I think that&#039;s because they are in the lower range on SR (Canadian product).&nbsp; But if they did, big deal.&nbsp; if they don&#039;t want the product they won&#039;t buy it.&nbsp; if they do, they will (they do!)<br /><br />I just think this topic is pointless - it&#039;s not like half the posts in the forums are about prices, I dont&#039; even see one a day.&nbsp;
