				You could put it in the discuss section of your page using the alias they have feedback under so other buyers can easily see why a 3/5 was left or the vendors section of the forums so other vendors can know the guys a noob.<br />&nbsp;Why is the buyer a LIAR ? did they deny ordering it priority?

				&nbsp; &nbsp;NO one here has any control over a package once it is dropped, anyone caught bitching about transit<br />time will be drawn and quartered.&nbsp; I get stuff from other continents in under a week.&nbsp; Express is for bitches anyway, I&#039;d wait dopesick shitting Yoohoo(if I was a junkie) an extra day or two for my shit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve cold-turkey&#039;d 60mg methadone/day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck express, it isn&#039;t worth it, and it attracts attention, plus if you don&#039;t process it that second, it isn&#039;t express.&nbsp; I don&#039;t order express under any circumstances, too many holes in the system.&nbsp; If I had a corporate drop or worked in the returns dept. for some mailorder place, I&#039;d do it, but that is different.&nbsp; Still a bad idea, IMO.

				my real point is, i mentioned in the add that it was an expirement and may be canceled. He CHOSE priority, paid priority. Even after i told him 3or4 times since last week BEFORE it was sent that he chose priority because express isnt even an option anymore. Yet still demanded over and over why wasnt it here overnight. i i would say again because its priority not express. so then he gets it bitches about size even though its &quot;good&quot; and says goota make these guys stick to there word! bro you paid for priority even if i offered express YOU CHOSE PRIORITY! WTF.<br />CRYNGIE- thankya sir good advice i will be taking it! hes the cause of my 1st non 5/5 review the fucker. <br />Now everybody has to adhere to the new rules of 10 transactions min, 1k spent with atleast a month under there belt. unless your a repeat customer of course.<br />can i get support to remove it since its based on an idiot not reading what he chose? not in anyway me. comp[letely about the fact that it didnt come overnight.

Way over 1/8th.<br /><br />Nobody should ever buy stamps expecting it to be cost efficient, it never is.<br /><br />I guess NY stamps could refer to the packaging, it says on his page that they are straight out of the Bronx or something though. Not saying it&#039;s bad shit, it&#039;s probably quite good, but I doubt it&#039;s china white.
