				I&#039;m just wondering at what age some of you started using illegal drugs.<br /><br />I know growing up I was introduced to MJ at a very early age and experimented with other drugs whenever I got the chance.&nbsp; Everyone I knew growing up did drugs, and I had an awesome childhood.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think it is very difficult to stop kids from doing drugs, and isn&#039;t putting an age limit on drugs the same as the legal restrictions imposed by big brother?&nbsp; Should their be an age limit?&nbsp; I think once you have the interest and ability to do something, go ahead and do it, but I&#039;m a crazy asshole, so I&#039;d like other opinions.

				Never drank or even touched drugs until i was 18. I read a manga (confidential confessions) and one of the stories involved drugs. Speed to be exact. So i was on a journey to find me some speed but had other relationships with other substances along the way. first it was mdma, then came along opiates, i hated them at first. then one day found a good dose and it was love. i was for reals in love with opiates, mostly oxy as it was easier to score. then my connect was gone and the love of my life for a year was cut off from me. then i finally got speed, Dexedrine from some random person i worked with, and threw him 20 dollars and gave me a big baggie from his old scrypt. probably about 200mg&#039;s worth. had 15mg and a bunch of 5mg caps in there. I had my fun with it. binges and what not. and very recently had those ICE speed pills, it was ok. i want some dexedrine now because it was cleeeeean and smoooooth.<br />now it&#039;s back to mdma and psychedelics mostly. those are my loves today. but i&#039;ve been eyeballing some H on the road...

				im going to tell you all my story of doing any drug for the first time in my life. <br />i was 12, and I was sleeping over my friends house (who conveniently lived next to me) and we had just got done watch the shining. let me just say this first, in my friends room he has a underground window so the window was at the bottom of a flat ditch and anyone could easily hop down and come through the window. so, we are about to go to bed when we hear a thump. we turned back on the lights and see my brother and his friend there. we both were really confused and let him in. my brother was tripping his nuts off and he explained to me he was nearby and wanted to say hi. we talked for a little and then he pulled out his pipe. he handed it to me, told me to hold the carb, and inhale. holy fuck, I never coughed so much in my life before. 1 minute later I look over to my friends desk and see the enormous bag of utz honey bbq chips. i grabbed them and ate the whole damn bag. then I passed out after a few hours, but holy shit it was so much fun. aparantly my eyes were more red than clifford the big red dog. i will never forget this moment. ive been toking ever since :]

				16 - MDMA<br /><br />I&#039;ve done many, many drugs since then. For some reason, weed is something I&#039;ve only tried once, I personally can&#039;t stand it...

				I was born with a bong in my hand!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously though:<br />Weed: 15, but didn&#039;t use it again until I was nearly 18.<br />Speed, 18. Pills 18.<br />MDMA: 22.<br />Mephedrone, Meth, LSD, NBOMe and all the rest were a fair way down the track.<br /><br />I was happy with Speed, weed &amp; MDMA for a long time. Then I found SIlk Road and decided to try a whole lot more things.

				14 - weed and various research chems<br /><br />The first time I got high was on weed. two kids at school hid a tiny little metal pipe in some bushes by where I lived and asked me to look for it for them. I did and eventually found it. I guess technically the first time I smoked weed is from the resin of that pipe, but later when they came to get it from me we ended up smoking a little weed. After that I smoked about ten dollars worth of weed with them a week, we would each put ten dollars down and get half an 8th a week. I started hanging out with them and their other friends a lot.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t much later that one of my older friends who was a class above me told me about DXM in cough syrup. The drug users in my class never really got into DXM but the class above us was heavily into it. One day a few of us got together and bought a bunch of cough syrup and drank it. I remember the first time I drank cough syrup it hurt really bad when I was coming up, but I got used to it after that. I started to drink cough syrup on a pretty regular basis after that. Problem is the stores started being always out of stock and also some of them stopped selling to young people because it was such a popular high.<br /><br />One day I looked up on the internet to see if I could buy cough syrup and instead I stumbled on a site that sold pure DXM powder and tons of research chemicals. Although at first I only orded DXM powder I later tried out several of the research chemicals as well. Let&#039;s just say that my highschool was soon awash with psychedelics :).

				a bit too early imo&nbsp; ;D<br />~13-17 i tried quiet a lot different subtances. <br />for me, at that time, it was something worth exploring ..and well indeed it was.. <br /><br />but i guess with a grown up mindset it would have been a even more fruitfull journey

				For some reason it was perfectly acceptable for me to drink beer and wine as a child.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have more than 1 for a while, but it definitely made me more responsible with drinking.&nbsp; I started catching buzzes when I was 8 or 9, and then started smoking weed when I was 10.<br /><br />By the time I was 14 I had done or was doing: Weed, Adderall, Cocaine, OC40s, Xanax, Morphine, K, and barbiturates.&nbsp; I did not get into psychedelics until I was 18 though, because I felt I wasn&#039;t ready to &#039;expand my mind&#039; as a youth.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My drug use has always remained recreational and not habitual.&nbsp; Except weed, but I only began smoking heavily in my late 20s, it was never my drug of choice when I was younger, though I&#039;ve grown seasonal indoor and outdoor crops and have sold weed since I was 15. <br /><br />:)

				14/15 - resin. Well thats what it was called, i think the correct term is &#039;pollen&#039; basically that brown stuff that came in blocks that ud burn(smells wonderful)&nbsp; and crumble and smoke to get stoned. When I started smoking that weed was actualy a rarity, it was hard to get hold of, which is crazy since it wasn&#039;t TOO long ago and I live in a major city.<br /><br />funny thing is now you can&#039;t get resin only weed :) <br /><br /><br />thankfully I quit around 4 years ago, it effected me in ways I didn&#039;t like. Never touched since. all my friends still do daily though

				First time I did drugs was when I was 18 and that was weed. The first time I ever did weed, other than coughing my lungs out and having no tolerance to drugs, I remember I kept humming in my sleep and I have no idea what that was about. Like I wasn&#039;t able to help it, every 10 minutes or something I would just make a humming noise lol... Did anyone else ever do that?<br />I also did Shrooms once when I was 18. Those were pretty fun, I look forward to doing those again.

				My friend found his older brother&#039;s bong and stash of weed when we were 13. He had a party at the house when his parents and brother were out one night, and he brought in the bong and weed. We (about 4 of us in total) sat in his bathroom and took hits, coughed like hell. I remember being really really high, going home and eating a load of Wagon Wheels, god dammit they are tasty. Started smoking weed every so often but stopped when I was 16 as I just started taking mcat and speed. 18 tried MDMA, hawaiian shrooms and started smoking weed again when a couple of mates (2 of them being the guys i first ever smoked green with) and i went to Amsterdam (and stopped mcat and speed). In the past year since I&#039;ve discovered SR, I&#039;ve tried 2CB and LSD. Really want to try some Mescaline though. I have had cocaine every so often since I was 17, but never really got into it
