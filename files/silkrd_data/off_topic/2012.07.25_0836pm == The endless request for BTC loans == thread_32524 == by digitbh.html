				Does it annoy anyone else that there are cheap assholes that can&#039;t afford their own habits? Almost every other post is a request for a loan. I kind of want to report each moocher to the moderators. <br /><br />I think there should be a rule put in place against asking for loans.

I think they should just open an area in the forum for people to ask for loans. If they did that it would help with all the clutter all over the place.

				If I need BTC I simply add some money to a bitcoin exchange and purchase coins. I&#039;ve even been 0.03 short of an order before but there&#039;s no way I&#039;d ask a stranger, I just couldn&#039;t.<br /><br />There should be one beggars thread rather than constant new begging threads.

				While I agree that it is annoying I wouldn&#039;t call them cheap assholes. The reason why there are so many is because a lot of buyers only buy the exact amount of BTC needed and don&#039;t think to buy a little extra to compensate for when the value of the BTC falls. I highly doubt someone would go through the effort just to get 0.05 BTC unless they actually needed it.

				if someone has a few hundred posts and is legit about it i don&#039;t mind at all when they ask, because i like to tell myself that someone would do the same for me. (this being said, i have never and probably will never ask, despite there being times when i&#039;ve been a little short) <br /><br />i tend to get pissed off with&nbsp; people who are obviously on different accounts asking for btc to scrape together like lowlives, but at the same time i feel bad for them. if that&#039;s what they have to resort to, who am i to make their day worse by slagging them off, yanno? :/
