				Who picked limetless to be a moderator and why?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read these forums pretty regularly since the beginning and I remember thinking &quot;who the fuck is limetless?&quot; when he was chosen.<br /><br />He had been on SR for just over a month when he was selected.

				I don&#039;t know why he was picked as a Mod. Further, I don&#039;t really care. Mod or not, he is the only member on my ignore list. He posts so fucking much of some of the most worthless garbage and I just couldn&#039;t take it anymore. He may not be here this week or whatever, but until I read the post in this thread, I had no idea he was still around at all. If you don&#039;t like him, just add him to your ignore list, and you don&#039;t have to see his bot-like postings anymore!

				My guess is that Limetless is a mod because of his money laundering expertise. Anyone stop to consider just how much the Road has earned, in the last year? One guy with a lot of (supposed) knowledge on money laundering, and another guy (or group) with a lot of money that needs to be laundered...<br /><br />And you people can&#039;t figure out why he&#039;s a mod?

				All I&#039;ve got to say that my first post on this forum was taken completely out of context by Limitless- about asshole weed dealers selling &quot;eighths&quot; as 1.3 g if you are lucky-[ nice introduction!!!] The other thing is all this talk of striping people (slashing with a knife&quot;)- it&#039;s not clever- there&#039;s enough of it in real life in the UK- it&#039;s very easy to play the&quot;hardman&quot; when when in cyber-space, and this business about a landrover- maybe I&#039;m ignorant about such things, but would that not involve a massive breach of personal privacy- vehicle papers, custom&#039;s forms and all the other paperwork associated with transporting a container with a land rover. Other thing is the business of electronic surveilance equipment he was selling ( not checked for months now, but he said he would have to pre-order it due to the expense- that seems another dodgy thing- how ,any suppliers of such equipment are there, it would seem fairly easy for&nbsp; to follow the paperwork. BUT, basically I just don&#039;t like loudmouths, so I am very glad to hear about the blocking possibility- he could be genuine, FE, scammer, greedy and dress in a pink polka dot dress in his spare time- I COULD NOT GIVE A RAT&quot;S ASS!!!! He&#039;s blocked, thank fuck!

I think you&#039;ll find he still has the authority to do as he did before cause he banned a bloke today making threats to people, but he was probably needed to help curb the spam flooding SR. You could always send a PM and ask him wretched if your curious. :)

				His boxes changed from blue to yellow today which can only mean that something has changed with his account, it now shows SR vendor twice, but no longer reads global moderator. I didn&#039;t read any resignation thread about him giving up the mod powers, so I thought I might have missed something.....he is also on my ignore list, but it doesn&#039;t change the fact that I noticed a change in his &quot;credentials&quot;...just wondering why, but thats me...always looking in to things for deeper meaning ;)

				Ok i&#039;m gonna drop a little knowledge then some opinion or vice versa you decide.<br /><br />1. To my the extent I&#039;m kept into the loop Limetless was DigitalAlch personal choice as his mod replacement when he retired<br />.DPR granted DA&#039;s&nbsp; last request because DA was a great moderator and deserved a last request or I just made that up.<br /><br />2.DPR has a certain type of person in his mind for Silk Road Moderators and I believe if he was de- modded it was because DPR found out from visits to the forum over time Limetless didnt exactly.fit his type to portray Silk Road moderator or Silk Road. This might have came to me during the long tinfoil hat wearing period this week I tried out.<br /><br /><br /><br />Does OP have the right to ask his question sure, do many community members have widely varying opinion and encounters with Limetless, yes. Do they havethe freedom to have those opinions hell yes.<br />Do members have to bicker with each other over the topic no. Cmon guys the forum is not a pissing contest like many play it. It&#039;s a place to share knowledge like adults about the Silk Road Marketplace/revolution, that means sometimes taking the high road and not posting at all and instead waiting for one of maybe only 2 people that actually know what&#039;s going on decides to replies. <br />Please if you do not have anything directly to contribute to the topic let troublesome posts go for another day. <br />Lately it seems we take a step forward one day as a community and the next day we destroy progress with infighting.<br />Maybe the original idea for this place is just to high concept and I mean we have the scam assault that lower moral which i&#039;d like to see organized schedules for spam busters that best fit their natural lifestyle to best benefit the entire community, then we have other scammers that have way better grasp of a proper scam, we have trolls slandering vendors and vendors slandering clients...I mean really does this topic have to go nuclear too? Let&#039;s try to be objective about others no matter what for the overall good.<br /><br />I&#039;mma throw some of my common sense in today again for free, yes two days in a row free common sense by nomad.<br />If Limetless was a personal security risk to silk Road or it&#039;s members, I&#039;m confident DPR or an admin would make a post before anyone noticed his little boxes changed colors.<br /><br /><br />Ok I&#039;m done with this topic til I either get a PM from DPR or Limetless or a post in this thread or a new thread addressing the issue of the color changing boxes.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad

				Hahaha this thread is pretty funny. :) All the drama for no reason! <br /><br />I got de-modded because I can be a cunt to people on here and this is because I have a short fuse which DPR spoke to me a couple of times about previously. I actually fully agree with the decision because this is DPR&#039;s site and he should of course have people he/she sees as the right fit. Also, really, I am too hot headed for the role anyway and that wont change so it&#039;s definitely for the best and on top of that lately I have been to busy to really give being a Mod my full attention so it wasn&#039;t right to continue with it anyway. <br /><br />So yeah all in all I hope I managed to do some good while I was Mod, I would like to think I did and all the best to the rest of you guys because you all do a sterling job. :) I definitely enjoyed my time despite the stresses it brings and I certainly feel privileged to have had a go at it even if it didn&#039;t work out. :)<br /><br />That really should be all there is to it I think so hopefully that should lay it to rest.

Digi noticed this and coz he was busy (possibly setting things straight before he left, who knows) he sorta wanted me as a bit of an attack-dog Mod to mop up the bastards because I didn&#039;t take any shit. <br /><br />That&#039;s all there is to it really, the forum ain&#039;t really like that anymore anyway the purpose ain&#039;t really here so this is a bit overdue anyway thinking about it. <br /><br />

This is NOT directed at the original poster (OP) but I&#039;ve seen this question posted numerous times. Twice today alone. It&#039;s crazy, really&nbsp; :o<br />Why do posters at this forum give a damn why Limitless was chosen? Is it because some posters felt they should have been chosen instead, because they &quot;deserved it more?&quot; I have no clue who Limitless is and as far as I know, I left him 1 reply in the 6 weeks since I really started reading here but he seemed kind &amp; his reply was rather funny considering he&#039;d never conversed with me. A few posters on the forums have been right a$$holes when replying to me over the past 6 weeks over benign crap and those jerks have no business whining about wanting to be a mod, in my humble opinion. Why do posters feel the need to insult some other posters? ESPECIALLY whining about newbs asking for help. Wtf is this? The childishness going on here reminds me of a high school clique fighting table seats. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like the forum mods, then why not create your own forum to chat on? If you don&#039;t like newbs, make your own forum &amp; ban them. But to continue to question the entire forum as to why DPR chose a specific mod, vs whoever else posters thought should have been chosen, is just pointless and a waste of time. We don&#039;t know the answer; only DPR knows why he chose Limitless...so why not ask the ONE person who knows the facts &amp; the truth, rather than continue to bicker like we&#039;re back in high school? Obviously, no one has come up with their own individual satisfactory answer, or the ridiculous posts asking why would stop appearing, almost every damn day. Ask DPR if you want a valid answer, otherwise, why continue the high school petty cat fights like teen girls on a public forum?&nbsp; ::)<br />Go ahead &amp; take my one karma. It&#039;s not like some people don&#039;t give neg karma for no reason, anyway...they&#039;ve almost made karma pointless. Almost.

A few posters on the forums have been right a$$holes when replying to me over the past 6 weeks over benign crap and those jerks have no business whining about wanting to be a mod, in my humble opinion. Why do posters feel the need to insult some other posters? ESPECIALLY whining about newbs asking for help. Wtf is this? The childishness going on here reminds me of a high school clique fighting table seats. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t like the forum mods, then why not create your own forum to chat on? If you don&#039;t like newbs, make your own forum &amp; ban them. But to continue to question the entire forum as to why DPR chose a specific mod, vs whoever else posters thought should have been chosen, is just pointless and a waste of time. We don&#039;t know the answer; only DPR knows why he chose Limitless...so why not ask the ONE person who knows the facts &amp; the truth, rather than continue to bicker like we&#039;re back in high school? Obviously, no one has come up with their own individual satisfactory answer, or the ridiculous posts asking why would stop appearing, almost every damn day. Ask DPR if you want a valid answer, otherwise, why continue the high school petty cat fights like teen girls on a public forum?&nbsp; ::)<br />Go ahead &amp; take my one karma. It&#039;s not like some people don&#039;t give neg karma for no reason, anyway...they&#039;ve almost made karma pointless. Almost.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I like you. You come to me with any issues you have while visiting silk road. +karma<br /><br /><br /><br />Also: Limetless, I just got the last...word.
