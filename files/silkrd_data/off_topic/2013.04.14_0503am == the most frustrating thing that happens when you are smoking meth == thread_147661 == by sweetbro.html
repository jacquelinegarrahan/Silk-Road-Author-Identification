				im stuck and cant drive and am on crutches. i have to relly on other people for a while.<br /><br />i need a hit from my pipe. i get the melt.. it hardens up and im ready to go.<br /><br /><br />then the newish jetlighter runs out of gas. you try fill it with the butane can and it just doesnt fill propelry.. so you get your second jetlighter and you fill it. you get some kind of action out of it but you are on borrowed time with it as you dont have much left in the butane can.<br /><br />you get your trusty bic lighter and you get some use out of it but your worried its going to get so hot it will break.. you light a tealight candle to preserve the flame because already the bic is running out of gas.. then the bic dies.. the tealight drops wax on the good jetlighters noozle for butane refilling and now its screwed and you dont want to think about it but anyway the butane refill can is now empty.<br /><br />you make a hopeless attempt at c;licking away at the jetlighters at least a hundred times and all can be heard is click click ckick. sometimes it gets a burns but not long enough.<br /><br />in the end you have no sources of ignition in the entire house.<br /><br /><br />so you ask the person thats comming up to see you to buy you two lighters.. they say no worries and you wait hours and they forgot to get them for you.<br /><br /><br />fuck that.. its a good melt ready to go.. i want fire!!!!<br /><br /><br />this has been the whole weekend for me.. the flame became precious and sacred.. seeing it was blessing when it came but i knew i was on borrowed time. it sucks not being able to drive or walk at the moment!

				well my opinion is i love the mental sexual effects.. porn or sex is great on it but for guys an erection is diificult.. its very addictive and you really have to know your stuff about looking after yourself when on it. you have to really be careful about the addictive potential and if you have real life ocnnections that can provide it to you it may be very difficult to stop. you havce to be very smart about its use.. and even the smartest people can fuck up quickly.<br /><br /><br />now to the high itself.<br /><br />the first high was via snorting.. it was the most incredible feeling ever.. watching the porno that was plsaying looked so much different and i remeber thinking instantly &quot;porn will never look the same again&quot; and also &quot;this is the drug ive been searching for all my life and no other drug matters aanymore&quot; and that was in the first 30 seconds... a little voice in the back of my head was concerned but those two thoughts are an example of the power of the high.<br /><br /><br />now if i rate that high a 10 then all subsequent highs are 1, 2 or 3 in my opinion.. never done iv and never will but the first high was the &#039;this is it&#039; high and all the others will never compare. ive done it via smoking, snorting and rectally. <br /><br />rectally was the most effective next and smoking is fun but seems short lived and a waste. snorting is very effective but its like having nails shoved up ur nose and it seems like it will fuck ur nose up.<br /><br />still its sexual mental effects are great and thats why i use it..&nbsp; but the more you do it was abuse it the less the high you are looking for will become boring.. after doing it for a week straight its just not worth the damage it produces which is why if you ever use it it must not be abused.<br /><br />in a way your subconscious mind tells you its the best thing ever but your conscious mind see&#039;s its a bit overrated. its like my subconcious mind is just in love with it so its a strange mix understanding its worth<br /><br />im going off it for 6 months when this small amount runs out and hopefully my tolerance will be low. <br /><br /><br />if i was ever going to suggest anybody mess with this stuff id suggest only using it maybe 4 times a year at the most.<br /><br />ive been honest here.. consciously in my head the highs havent been so good as teh first time unlike other drugs and yet ive basically giv en up interest in all the other drugs ive used and cycled myself around like lsd, mdma.. i got 2-cb i used to love doing but i got 3 pills left and no iunterest.. i got 100grams of ghb and i would just throw it away .. everything is worthless compared to meth and yet an mdma high seems to produce more consistant good highs..<br /><br /><br />so for all its worth it has some positive aspects but all the bad things that people say about mketh is pretty spot on. when i was asking people online when i was like you the users would tell me &quot;dont do it&quot; and eventually i did- and from me to you after 4 months of weekly fornightly daily usages i say you that its probobly not worth your time compared to other drugs like mdma or coke.<br /><br />im saying dont do it using my concious section of my brain.. but my subconcious thinks im being a little too harsh on meth and its looking forward to fucken getting &quot;high as fuck&quot; shortly.

				I have always wanted to try meth, simply from watching others on it.&nbsp; They all seemed to be so fuckin high that its impossible not to want to experience that.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be honest I&#039;m still a little freaked out about it, but I want to thank you for explaining it for us.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; The porn thing got me, definitely gonna try it now!

				hehe mate.. the porn.<br /><br />well the first time i used meth the porn was amazing but everytime you use it it becomes less &quot;fucken awesome&quot; and right now im not even seeing the difference. the first time i saw it is was very visual and almost psychedelic in a way.. that was my scale 10 rating<br /><br />ill tell you, a few times after my first i was sniffing poppers (amyl nitrite) smoking meth and watch this GGG john tompson german hardcore porn (i fucklen love that shit) well i was watching a new video and i was rapidly sniffing poppers and blowing clouds - very dangerous mind you.. but id worked myself up so bad i declared the porno video &quot;heaven&quot; and the meth as my &quot;god&quot; and i spoke loud to myself &quot;meth is my god!&quot; and at the same time i rejected all labels of gay str8 and bi created by humans and declared my sexual orientation as &quot;pornography&quot;.. i had a heart strain feeling for a week after. i would have rated this as a 6 in comparison to my first time but it was more intense due to nearly od&#039;ing.<br /><br />a large part of why porn is so good is because your dick might be limp but you a like a 14 year old boy thats viewing his first porno - then times that by 10,000. your brain just oozes &quot;mental sexual arousal&quot;. you wont get that sober<br /><br />but im really bugged out the past few days porn doesnt phase me much as ive been using the whole week and its just not working. with meth you abuse the privlege of its awesomness and meth will lose its magic vastly quicker than mdma could.<br /><br />a similar alternative is having a sniff of amyl nitrite (poppers) and you watch the video and you will get the similar effect.. wit poppers you get an immersion and it feels like your jumping through the screen and in the video. dont listen to society rant on about poppers. if you watch a good scene sniffing poppers you will see it in a different but just as powerful way to meth.. for me poppers create an effect that rivals meths first time just in a different way<br /><br />i get high on meth and sniff poppers while watching my favorite bits and i go off into lala land.<br /><br />i wont use meth if i dont have poppers<br /><br />i would advise trying to sniff poppers and just watch your favorite porn scene. you dont need to wank.. just watch what happens.. its amazing..<br /><br />kinda feel bad like im condoning meth use - just rember that porn and meth gives you double trouble and remeber that in my experience the first time was the best.. when i saw it i was frightened when i thought &quot;porn will never be the same again&quot;.. abuse it you lose it though.<br /><br />i need a break to get it back.&nbsp; dont let your body die inside out from out just to see porn if you think you&#039;ll enjoy it.. this is why i suggest sniffing poppers first as an alternative. cos its just as powerful just in a different way.<br /><br />also, doing it weekly i didnt even mention the entire aspect of not bothering with my friends anymore. ive ignored some friends since early march as i lost interest in replying to their texts or calls. i didnt even return anybodies calls that run me on my birthday! .. id have rather thought about using meth in 3 days and i couldnt be bothered accommodating their time. people end up just getting in the way for me.<br /><br />for me as an example - 4 months ago i was supersensitive/anxious about what people thought of me.. already i just dont give a fuck. i dont even feel anger.. just annoyance when people try to chat.. im just like &quot;what the fuck do you want?&quot; and &quot;yawn&quot; to people in my head. but when im not using i am very depressed and want to die. that is due to the dopamine depletion in your brain. meth will take its toll.<br /><br />fuck.... im going to smoke some more clouds right now... and then watch more porn. its the devils drug! study up hard on preventing neurotoxicity and be prepared to ignore it all. god i hope im not too fucked up over the next week without it

				just wanted to add a few things for any newbies that may be considering trying meth.<br /><br /><br />1.) do your research about looking after yourself before during after. read up on comedowns<br />2.) dont assume your strong enough mentally to only do it once because nobody does it &quot;just once&quot; unless they had a horrible experience<br />3.) if you ever meet somebody that just offers meth so you can &quot;try it&quot; on the spot that person is not good company and its irresponsible. he m. Look down on people that are eager to give you some to try because its very easy to ruin ur life over. you migight meet you at a party and you never see him again but you took his gift and a year ;later your life is in the pits. i would never offer&nbsp; meth to a newbie its against the principles of common decency<br />4.) read up on everything there is to know about staying healthy and prepare water. be prepared that you will not look after yourself.<br />5.) be prepared for anything to happen and read up on bad things that might happen.<br />6.) communicate with meth users before during and after especially at drugs forum on clearnet. they&#039;re good over there with advice.<br />7.) if you want to try it with a mate it would be better to tell him a few months in advance instead of the week before. if he&#039;s clueless about meth he is in greater danger of falling than you if you learned something. be his mentor and teacher.. you might be fine but you mate might ruin himself.<br />8. everytime you use is an opportunity to fuck up and give yourseld an addiction.<br />9.) never bincge for days without sleep. alwayseat and get a good nights sleep<br />10.) sr offers a way to distance yourself with an edequate time frame to get more.. if your next door neighbour sells it i would think youraddiction is enevitable. you have to really love yourself and your health because such easy access to a drug kike this you cant count on willpower and disiplinine<br />11.) if every drug you used you had no problems and people marvel at your ability to be a part time tabbacco smoker - meth is a different fish. it might be instant, weeks or months but if you give into days in a row or a few times a week id get out fast.<br />12.)when i say my current high scale is usually 1-3 compared to the first times 10 note that if you get high as fuck sometimes its not feeling better and your high is a rapid beating heart.. if feeling high is defined by nothing but feeling like you will have a heart attack dont do it.<br />other feelings like rushes and euphoria diminish fast with regular use.. dont throw all the positive away.<br />13 never giuve into a comedown by using more meth.. and know that you face a comedown or you become a &quot;never come down&quot; person thats crazy.. obtain xanax or valium to help you get sleep<br /><br />important - if you did study the drug and safe usage from different sites you have done well. you might even have a frequency of use plan set out.. but once you get that first hit you can either stick to what your obligated to do or if you neglect yourself. you wont know until you actually are in the experience. as i mention i did 3 years of curious study on it and my two initial thoughts scared me. My effect of &quot;devaluing every drug may not be commion result but it really surpised me. be ready for thoughts you didnt expect to come up.. &quot;just once&quot; might become &quot;awesome within a microsecond. <br /><br />ive never had a drug tell my brain to push out other drugs like that before. remember it depletes dopamine in your brain and meth mimics it so you might be toally fucked for years - this is way worse than having a bong cough and mdma comedowns are nothing in comparison - if you take l-tyrosine supplents fter use it will help restore you brain quicker.. expect to feel down for a week. if you be stupid and use it daily for weeks and months you re totally fucked. dont let it happen to you. i let it happen to me just this week with 7 days consecutive usage.<br /><br /><br /><br />as for why you want to try it:<br /><br />1.) i said the porn was great on it but while the first time was a 10 the rest are 1-3 ratings. the more you use the more you loose<br />2.)if you are doing it for porn you may well become a porn addict. if things go bad you&#039;ll associate porn with meth and get cravings forever.<br />3.) if you lose control and its easy to do you might end up having to learn what &quot;sober sex/masturbation is like and that would be horrible<br />4.)you may have periods of abstinence off meth and you will switch off your porn or whatewver. when meth is usedw ith porn both get shut down IMO<br />5.) you get so high on the first time and in my experience subsequent ones dont even match.<br />6.) if you really liked porn the first time id try not use for at least 4 months before &quot;seeing it again&quot; if you have any chance of presving its beauty.<br />7.) most men lose their inability to get erections while on it but still wank flaccid compulsively for 12 hours non stop.. i though i was above that and ive done 14 hour strectes on the same 3 minute sections. it will be hard to stop at first you just gotta put your pants back on and you feel frustrated.<br />8.) many people&nbsp; use viagra or cilas with meth but you may have heart issues with the two and having a hardon wont get you release. regular abusers can end up with permanent erectile disfunction<br /><br /><br />so is porn worth the risk - it was to me so far because i love my ggg porn and i always have looked for the perfect sex drug. if i become addicted, eternally struggle with moderation -definately not. the first time it was great but they arent as great your second and third time. doing it now after seven days consecutive use its not fucken worth the damage it does whatsoever.. and prepare for looking at it and thinking i was telling shit. some people obsessively clean and dont feel sexual the erectile dysfunction is the worst of all meth has to offer though...; the ability to get as horny as a 14 year and actually surpase that level hundreds of times is a good experience.. sobriety wont give you that but metrh will give you a limp dick.. its still not to bad but dont be silly with it.<br /><br />im not sure how my sobriety pans out the next few days - what if my world collapses? at my state im only doing it easy but you shoulkd go to addict forums for meth like drugs forum or the bluelight darkside section. when you read recovery journals of ex-users it might turn you off. i never want to get there where you want to die for up to 30 days the first stage<br /><br />for you i say if you really want to see it check my claims with others - at least 10 people. find out how they like sex or porn. dont jump into it because i say i like it.<br /><br /><br />when i started using the first 5 -10 times i could see it eating away at my desire to communicate with people and it felt like it attacked certain regions of the brain dealing with social interaction.<br /><br /><br />essentially the first time seeing porn was perfect. the rest of the veiwings quickly deteriorated.. you do it too often and that golden &quot;mental sexual high&quot; may be lost.. thats the best part.. so dont do it more than a few times a year.. i suspect it will be hard for most.. uneducated people are at highest risk of developing health problems and addictions.. only buy small amounts to cover you each time you do it and remembrer you just cant have a daily multiple binge <br /><br /><br />so if you want to try it once you better be educated, informed and have plans to avoid reusing.. very rare for people to resist doing again. i feel sorry for and friday and saturday night type ice socialisers that never knew meth before they tried it.. ,my extesinsive education online has delayed the point im at tonight by 4 months.. most niave users are probobly in horrible states.. dont ever abuse this drug..

I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; As though it&#039;s so bland and boring without meth, I don&#039;t even want to bother.&nbsp; Though I&#039;m always on meth... I mean at least a little bit to keep the withdrawal away, if nothing else.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s interesting that you mention the social thing; I can&#039;t remember if that happened to me (I&#039;ve always been pretty introverted anyway frankly), but if I&#039;m strung out or stay awake too long I start mis-reading social interaction.&nbsp; Like I get confused and I&#039;m not sure where the conversation is coming from or what the motivation for somebody saying something was.&nbsp; Like I just start losing the ability to interact with other human beings.&nbsp; The stuff that we all do so easily and naturally starts getting fucked up, and I&#039;m not even sure how to describe what goes wrong.&nbsp; It&#039;s really strange and embarrassing when it happens.&nbsp; I imagine it&#039;s something like what people with Aspergers Syndrome go through, but I really wouldn&#039;t know -- I don&#039;t have it or anything.<br /><br />Something I&#039;ve become increasingly curious about is how there are some people -- like you and me -- that just get that sort of &quot;click&quot; with amphetamines; then there are others who barely even feel it when they take it, and just describe it as overrated and mediocre.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about you, but there was always something self destructive in me.&nbsp; I mean I&#039;ve always found it glamorous or appealing somehow to just burn away.&nbsp; Very odd reaction, really, considering it has no survival benefit whatsoever as far as I&#039;ve seen.&nbsp; Well, I suppose there&#039;s something to be said for being willing to stand in front of a bear and say &quot;come on you fucking pussy, let&#039;s go!&quot;<br /><br />But I mean really, you&#039;re gonna get your limbs torn off and not survive to have kids or pass that trait on... so what the fuck?&nbsp; LOL... whatever.&nbsp; I just wanted to say I feel ya, man.&nbsp; :)

Fossil deposits and stuff, right?) and we can just light it and watch all that potential energy just explode in a flash of light. It&#039;s horrible and beautiful and glorious all at once. Sorry, just felt inspired here for a second.

				Finding myself a quarter mile off the state park trail, jerking off for hours on a towel with a tub of vaseline and baby oil and pornography splayed out all around me, got pretty frustrating after the 4th or 5th time.

What Is the High like? Also does snorting give desired effects?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The high is extremely powerful. Very strong... Like cocaine, but even stronger and lasts waaaaay longer.<br />Snorting works but you won&#039;t get an intense rush like you do when you smoke it. But I wouldn&#039;t recommend a first-timer to smoke meth.<br />In fact, unless you have a lot of self control, I wouldn&#039;t recommend using meth at all. It is extremely addictive. I&#039;ve seen so many people who used meth, and a lot of them have a bad problem.<br />And the comedown... Well that&#039;s another story.
