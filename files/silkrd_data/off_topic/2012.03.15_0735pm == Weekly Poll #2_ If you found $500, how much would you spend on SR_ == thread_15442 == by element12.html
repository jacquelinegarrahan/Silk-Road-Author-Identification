				Imagine you are walking through town and you find an unmarked envelope with $500 inside.&nbsp; <br />There is nobody around, no way to find whose money it is. <br /><br />How much would you spend on SR?&nbsp; This includes buying BTC or putting the money aside to save for future sales on SR or if you know you want to spend it here.&nbsp; It does not include saving in your bank or spending on bills/food/etc.<br /><br />Also, whether you spend here or elsewhere, what would you spend it on?<br /><br /><br />Results from last weeks poll (Which is your favorite class of drugs?)<br />Winner-Psychedelics, 45.3%<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14605.0

				Tricky question, because I&#039;m currently considering a purchase of about that size, but have yet to finish saving the funds.&nbsp; So technically, I would spend all of it.

				That was a pretty great question, I would only spend $400 though. Normally I would spend all $500 on the Silk Road but I have truck payments.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I would separate the funds to get a little bit of everything though.&nbsp; ;D

				Five hundred dollars would last me forever on SR, lsd is cheap. I might by some hash oil and that would be kinda expensive. All of it no matter what.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				yeah i&#039;d spend it all here, but i wouldn&#039;t spend the lot on one purchase - might be too tempting for a vendor to get the shit &#039;lost in the post&#039;

				I don&#039;t want to sound sanctimonious, but there are issues of karma to be considered here. Think about it, if you lost $500, would you want someone to find it and spend it or try to find you to return it? It&#039;s that simple.

				I wouldn&#039;t spend it &quot;on&quot; SR, I would spend it &quot;for&quot; SR - namely trying to increase purchase quantity to get lower prices and pass that on to you guys.<br /><br />Although when you are talking pounds of cannabis and mushrooms, $500 isn&#039;t going to get you very far.&nbsp; $5,000 maybe you&#039;re talking a bit.&nbsp; $50k and we&#039;re getting somewhere really fast ;)

				- well if you found 500 on the street it would belong to the 1st person you asked &quot;is this yours&quot;<br /><br />- if it suddenly appeared in my wallet, or SR a/c how would i go about tracking down its rightful owner?! if DPR/admins realised it had been put into my a/c i&#039;m sure they&#039;d<br />&nbsp; transfer it out before i had a chance of noticing it..dunno<br /><br />&nbsp;???<br />

				I probably wouldn&#039;t buy any more or less than I do now on anything really. I still live off my parents for the most part and any real expense is taken care of right now or I&#039;m paying for it myself. I&#039;m not short on cash, in fact I&#039;ve been saving some. If I had to spend it on something, like it wouldn&#039;t exist in a month, I&#039;d buy a volcano vaporizer and if with whatever was left over, I&#039;d like to try Ketamine once and the rest would go to weed and magic mushrooms (never had any shrooms, but I bought some recently and if I don&#039;t like them I can still give them away to friends).
