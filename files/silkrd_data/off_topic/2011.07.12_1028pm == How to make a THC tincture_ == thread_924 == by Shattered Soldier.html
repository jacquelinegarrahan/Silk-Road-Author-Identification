				I&#039;ve been wanting to get a little creative with my cannabis and have been scouring the web for good &quot;Everclear Tincture&quot; methods.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found everything from <br /><br />-grinding it <br />-leaving as much whole bud as you can -<br />soaking it for months -<br />only soaking it for seven days or less.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.

				I&#039;ve made it twice. Once with 80% Polish spirit, and once with plain old vodka. Both times I ground it in a herb grinder, both times I left it for a couple of weeks, shaking it occasionally when I remembered to. Both worked absolutely fine. Put less herb in if you use vodka, or use twice the amount of vodka, as obviously it&#039;s half as strong in alcohol.<br /><br />The vodka burned less on the tongue, and was altogether more pleasant, though it was hardly what I&#039;d call &#039;delicious&#039;!<br /><br />They say if you heat it up you can do the whole thing in a few minutes, but I&#039;ve always been on gas at home so fuck bringing a pan of alcohol anywhere near that.

				I love a good tincture. Everclear will work. Just grind up the bud, put it in a jar, pour some Everclear in, and let it sit in a dark place. Shake it up a few times a day. <br /><br />The amount of bud you use vs. the amount of Everclear you use and the amount of time you let it sit will all play a factor in the potency of the end result. I&#039;d say let it sit for at least a month, if not two. <br />

				DigitalAlch&#039;s Awesome Sauce - (Alchohol-Based Tincture)<br />30% Everclear / 70% Van Gough Melon Vodka<br /><br />-Get a magic bullet to grind your weed. Don&#039;t use a coffee grinder, it leaves to the weed to fine. <br />-All Liquid and Plant Matter place into a large thermos (Add enough weed to fill 3/5 - 2/ 3 of the thermos - add the liquor first)<br />-Put in freezer for 7 - 10 days (Shake the container 5 times a day - Stir it at least 3 times a day)<br />-Use cheesecloth to filter out the cannabis (Squeeze all the liquid out of this crazy mass)<br />-Funnel into 50mL bottle with droppers (Look in your painting Isle at Hobby Lobby)<br /><br />Start with 3 drops and see how you feel. Guess I&#039;m giving away my recipe now..<br /><br />Shit,<br />DigitalAlch

				Sorry for the necropost but I want to get an answer on this very subject.<br />I used to smoke every day from early am to late evening and loved it but now times have changed and I cant smoke any more. I still like to get stoned though so I have been experimenting with edibles, made some nice truffles with gold seal hash that worked a treat but it took too long to come on and titrating a dose was difficult so I came to the idea of tinctures.<br /><br />Say I have 5g of top grade bud, and some Polish Vodka (75% volume/150 proof), what is the ideal method?<br />From what I have read I need to grind the herb up and decarboxylate it, then add to about 1 fl oz spirit per gram of bud. Then I plan to use DA&#039;s method above and simmer (or almost simmer) the mix for a while to speed the extraction before freezing it for a couple of weeks, in my mind this will rupture any remaining trichomes and get me nearer to 100% extraction. I want to make a tincture that is active in a few drops rather than the 1 to 2ml seen in some recipes, is there anything else I should do?
