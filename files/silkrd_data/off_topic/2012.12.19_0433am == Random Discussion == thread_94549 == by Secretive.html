				This thread is for any discussion on any random topic. Hence the name &quot;Random Discussion.&quot; This is a place for members to just chill and talk about anything and also have fun! I feel this will eliminate a lot of nonsense threads because you could start any discussion in here!<br /><br />I&#039;ll start things off. How the fuck is everyone doing today?<br /><br />Secretive

				I feel you both. I am personally a little annoyed. I ordered a batch of 25i from HardHustle before he took a break. Unfortunately, it was part of the bad batch so he shipped it about 8 days ago when he said he was taking care of all it. It&#039;s been 8 days and it hasn&#039;t arrived yet. He dealing with other stuff and hasn&#039;t even been on in 10 days since that day. Messaging him will probably take awhile to get back to me.

				Agreed, this is getting fucking ridiculous. I just cannot accept &quot;We are busy&quot; as a reason to not post an update, it would take all of 3 minutes to give us some piece of mind. This isn&#039;t just a business, we all stand to go to prison for a very long time for what we do here and it&#039;s just not okay to leave us in the dark like this.

I&#039;ve noticed that many of them (probably because they lack the business of the larger vendors ) take a bit more of an active role, if not in the forums, but at least in answering back promptly and being nice about any questions you have. <br /><br />Although I do enjoy seeing a vendor being active in the forums as well.<br /><br />And I&#039;ve been doing well - just being able to walk again after major reconstructive ankle surgery after I was in a car wreck, so I&#039;m feeling rather nice. Just trying to find a job at the moment which is a hastle.

				I was thinking of starting a thread like this too. Thought it was a bit strange there still wasn&#039;t a general discussion thread, rather than everybody making a whole new thread for 5 posts worth of conversation. You did the electronica one too didn&#039;t you. Are you spying on my brain? haha.<br /><br />Random thought: Do you think many vendors, once we send them our name/address, search for us on facebook for a little inspection? Especially if any of us has uncommon names (like me... I am the only one with my first &amp; surname on there. I would be easy to find).

It is not gonna happen and I need a helmet for the amount of times I&#039;ve banged my head against the wall being frustrated.<br /><br />- I love the people that actively engage on here, especially with shit like this.

I&#039;ve only ordered twice from SR, so I&#039;m still very much new to this, but expect I will be getting many more orders under my belt in the coming years, assuming nothing bad happens to SR (fingers crossed). But yeah, just the way this is literally so much like amazon/ebay - I almost forget what I&#039;m doing is 100% illegal and could get me in serious trouble, and that there of course is huge risk being taken in doing this.<br /><br />- Haven&#039;t done shrooms yet.&nbsp; &nbsp;YET.<br /><br />- Only made 2 orders, but still, my second one wasn&#039;t as brilliantly smooth as the first (which was perfect)... and I noticed I was sighing a bit in disappointment, as though, like you said, the vendor was supposed to be some huge multinational corporation with skyscaper HQ&#039;s all over the world with perfect service; and not some dude sitting in his little flat handling it all by himself.<br /><br />- This forum is awesome. I&#039;ve been on all kinds of forums over the years, usually for artists/bands I like etc. - but this one is by far my favourite community.

				@zenvoboy - Yes, I have only made two transactions myself but have also received three (?) other shipments between sample reviewing and contests. Which has been excellent. For shrooms, I have to say if you&#039;re gonna go with a vendor on here? I would choose Cyclone. I received one of his samples and it was awesome. Great product. Great packaging. Great communication. If I have some more money come my way anytime soon? I&#039;m definitely placing an order with him again. <br /><br />Oh, and this trip guide was EXTREMELY reassuring for me and made my first time phenomenal.<br /><br />*clearnet link* http://www.shroomery.org/6256/The-Psychedelic-Experience-FAQ

				^ Thanks. Although I&#039;m from the UK and, unless I really have to, or until I get a bit more confidence with customs etc., I only really want to order domestically. We do have a couple of Cubensis vendors though, both with good feedback. &quot;amush&quot; does 3g (dried) for ฿2.87, is that roughly the standard price I should expect?<br /><br />What about Amanita Muscaria? Have you ever tried them? What are they like in comparison to Cubensis?

				Talking about AM, from what I&#039;ve found it&#039;s like all the negatives of being drunk, with mild visuals and in high doses it has the tendency to induce delerium. Doesn&#039;t sound to palatable to me. I&#039;d just stick to shrooms, TBH. Although I do enjoy trying new things.

				Aaaargh. Can&#039;t decide what drug(s) to get/try next.<br /><br />I wish I could afford everything all at once, but unfortunately I pretty much have to try them one at a time.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only done Weed and MDMA so far...<br /><br />At the moment I think I wanna try the more stimulating drugs (so no Ketamine etc... yet) - or maybe psychedelics.<br /><br />I think my shortlist is down to:<br />Speed/MDPV (cheap... might be good for getting me in the mood to go out more in the first place)<br />Cocaine (has to be tried, but is so expensive)<br />GHB (because of the MDMA + GHB hype)<br />Psychedelics (would prefer to try the &quot;classics&quot; of LSD or Shrooms before any NBOMe/2C-B/DMT etc. stuff)<br /><br />Hmmmm...

				Where I live there are plenty of cubensis shrooms growing in literally bullshit. Why trying AM? I wish I could send those shrooms to all of you in a secure way...<br />If someone tells me how to proceed with packing/drying, etc... I&#039;ll send you for free a sample next time I go to the countryside&nbsp; ;)

				I wish there was a way of being notified of which post somebody gave +1 karma for.<br /><br />Or is there a way?<br /><br />I notice my karma go up but I have no idea who did it or when/why they did it&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />@sailor - You should find out! Could have yourself a little business right there, with awesome profit margins (seeing as you&#039;d be collecting them free of charge from the countryside, rather than growing yourself).<br /><br />Also might wanna learn some good cleaning methods too. I don&#039;t think many people would fancy ingesting shrooms with specs of cow shit on them&nbsp; :P

				I went to my first rave :) I went by myself, but got tipsy/drunk before I left, then ate a nice amount of MDMA and had a great time. Slightly foggy memory of the whole night, but I know it was a good one :D<br /><br />Got 3 more raves lined up over the coming months too. Can&#039;t wait.

				Lol! I was doing my 90 pages of Karma the other day (new SR record! &gt;:D Previous was 60 or something) and came across both your old name and your new name. I remembered, oh yeah, where did that guy go lol? I clicked on your profile and found your last post and MY old posts here. ::) That was AGES ago!<br /><br />pmsl ::) that sounds like a typical party... ::) Except for the choking bit. I hate it when someone acts like a dick when you are drunk, b/c you can&#039;t remember who to punch the next day, night&#039;s a blur. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and That Was AGES Ago! :o
