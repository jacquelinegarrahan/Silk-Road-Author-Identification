				Rango, just because of Johnny Depp. I could swear I could differentiate the character&#039;s expressions/gestures to every character JD has ever done in his movies.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Tried watching the most recent Alice in Wonderland, not a good idea.

				Any Pixar film is beautiful on acid. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is another touching, yet visually pleasing movie. I watched The Breakfast Club once on the comedown and it made me tear up a bit, but younger people probably would be touched by it. :)

				I think it was my second time on LSD... I was 20 and got together with a group of friends (unaware that 2 of us were about to trip).<br /><br />We had a good time playing rounders - i was surprised i was still even capable of running and catching the ball considering where my head was travelling - and then a few of us back to a mates house - where he decided to put on Naked Lunch. Yeaugh, the bugs! Very fun. I was then introduced to sex with typewriters and never looked back!

I agree that being out in nature is better, but that&#039;s not always a possibility. Not to mention certain films can really enhance the trip. For instance try watching Finding Nemo, you get to see all kinds of life underwater and really immerse yourself into the experience of being in the ocean. It brings out so many emotions and feelings in a relatively small portion of time which can make the rest of the 10+ hours you&#039;ll be tripping quite pleasant. ^-^

				I prefer to be near a computer or in nature, but if I had to choose... <br /><br />Alice by Jan Svangemaker (See it sober first, much better) <br />Uncle Meat/Baby Snakes, both by Frank Zappa<br />Yellow Submarine,<br />As someone else mentioned, anything by Pixar<br />Anything 90&#039;s Nickelodeon... complex analyses of Hey Arnold! dominated my last experience with LSD... for fun, I integrated them into some areas of Finnegan&#039;s Wake... Actually pretty interesting the next day.

				Triplets of Bellville. Astonishing animation, perfect soundtrack, few spoken words. This movie plays like a trip. That is the only way I can describe it.

				I could never concentrate on movies, found the walls much more interesting. I was looking at my girlfriends wardrobe once and the shadows became really dark and menacing, then I watched someone get cremated as their coffin slowly moved into the wardrobe and was lit up by the warm colored flames inside the cremation chamber. I was fascinated by it, not scary at all. <br /><br />Love looking at my jeans too, there is always an endless pattern of graffiti style words forming in the fabric of the denim, some words and sentences so real I could read them out to people as they formed and some in a weird language I didn&#039;t understand .<br /><br />Once when we had sexy time she was on top and the ceiling above became black and I was in outer space, streaks of light shot by like we where on the starship enterprise. Another time I had my eyes closed whilst we did it and this whole story evolved and we where bus conductors screwing in an empty bus that had stopped in the depot, when I opened my eyes i said &quot;fuck, we aren&#039;t bus conductors?&quot; She was like wtf?<br /><br />Good times
