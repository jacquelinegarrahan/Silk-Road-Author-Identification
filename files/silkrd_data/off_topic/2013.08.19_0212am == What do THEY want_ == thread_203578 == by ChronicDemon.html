				Hello SR Members and Vendors.<br />I wanna get a thread going with your ideas on why LE wants SR to be obliterated.<br /><br />Obvious reasons aside<br /><br />I just wanna get your take on the whole dilemma we face here.<br /><br />Are they here for everyone of us? Just the vendors? The Owners?<br /><br />What do they stand to gain by taking down this website and preventing us from purchasing what we all love.<br /><br />In my eyes, the war on drugs is a complete failure, it was since day one.<br />And i think its just a bit unrealistic that LE waste there time with any of us.<br />I mean, what&#039;s the point in putting a few more criminal druggies and dealers behind bars? <br />To fill quota&#039;s and sleep well at night thinking they&#039;re saving the world one arrest at a time?<br />I think not...<br /><br />We&#039;re like the hydra, you take off one head, and 2 more grow back.<br /><br />They&#039;re fighting an un-winnable battle against the internet.<br /><br />So, Thoughts, comments, ramblings?<br /><br />I welcome all and any inputs.

				Maybe a few who have denied drugs and always stuck to the strict rules that were the framework of their upbringing. Maybe some are looking for the glory of getting a &quot;big bust&quot;.&nbsp; Maybe some radicals who have certain ideas drilled into their head and have fully absorbed all of the bs that has been fed to them... Idk, there seems to be alot of different things that drive people.&nbsp; Some people have underlying legitimate reasons why their chemical make-up arranged in such a way and some just can&#039;t stand not having complete power.&nbsp; I think that eventually something big will happen between LE and SR, but not for a long time.

				It&#039;s just to me, its a never ending cycle. They take down SR? Then what...There&#039;s just gonna be another place where everyone goes ( like atlantis ) to go get their drugs anonymously...<br /><br />There will always be places like SR. <br /><br />So in my eyes, it just makes more sense to provide a safer alternative than to constantly keep fighting a never ending battle.<br /><br />Just putting us all behind bars isnt gonna solve anything...<br /><br />Like, i understand. Drugs are a serious source of crime and murder... which is why we need LE, to help put people who would kill and steal away in jail to keep the majority safe.<br /><br />I can understand why they do their jobs, and im sure most have a decent reason to, whether its a personal reason, or just how their moral fiber is set up when they are raised.<br /><br />But i mean, not all of us are bad. Most of us are good people who just like to ease the beatings life gives us with a little substance abuse here and there.<br /><br />To any LE who may be reading &quot; Noone ever makes it out of life alive...so why waste your days and little time you have on this planet chasing a bunch of fellow human beings, just to lock them up like dogs...If you want justice, there are plenty of real crimes going on in the real world, like murders and theft. You call us criminals, but yet all we want is a little freedom..Thats what my country was fought and bled for, to have the right to be free and live your life without persecution of your lifestyle and choices, but you just keep coming at us, making new laws, to imprison us and keep our bodies shackled like animals in cages.<br />Not all of us are these horrible people portrayed in movies and in the media...alot of us are just like you...good people with good hearts, who love our friends and family, who would give a hand to help his fellow man...You shouldn&#039;t be trying to fight us...instead you should be trying to address the problem, and see what good you can bring out of it...Drug dealing is the biggest industry in the world....and its your attitude on the matter, and the laws your politicians make that turn most of us in the murderous thugs you think we are.....If you keep saying &quot; You&#039;re scum, You&#039;re the worst kind of people &quot; It&#039;s only so long before we start to believe your words, and become what you tell us we are...&nbsp; &quot; <br /><br />That&#039;s my rant for the night...and i hope some of you enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed righting it.<br />Life is too short to waste time over petty bullshit...Some of us just want to enjoy it the only way we know how...<br /><br />Have a good day/night everyone.<br /><br />-CD<br /><br />
