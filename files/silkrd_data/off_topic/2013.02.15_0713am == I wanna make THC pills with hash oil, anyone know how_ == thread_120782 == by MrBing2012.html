				I&#039;m going on a family trip and it&#039;s gonna suck if I&#039;m not high so I&#039;m wondering if I could just make some pills with my oil.<br /><br />I have a gram of ethanol oil and a couple grams of ISO oil. <br />I&#039;m not sure if it needs to be decarboxylated first but I was thinking of just simmering the oils in vegetable oil for about 5 minutes and pouring into capsules. Would this would work?<br /><br />I&#039;m leaving tomorrow so any replies would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks :)<br /><br />Also which is better for THC extraction, canola or olive oil?

				There&#039;s a product called cannabrex, that i&#039;m surprised we havn&#039;t seen more of on here.<br /><br />basically, its a chemical kit (gelcaps and all) that&#039;s designed to do exactly what you describe. I won&#039;t even go into detail, just look it up on clearnet. They even have a formulation called cannabrex 3x, which increases oral bio-availability of THC; as far as I can tell, is just some piperine.<br /><br />Good luck! <br /><br />Edits:<br />Sorry, realized my post comes way past usefulness. I&#039;d say just cook it with some oil, and make shots of it or something. Could alcohol dissolve it as a tincture in time?

				You can just put the hash oil into a gelcap.

				You&#039;re right about the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (2-COOH-THC) having to be decarboxylated into THC. 2-COOH-THC decarboxylates rapidly (in a few seconds) at 106°C but if the temperature is too high, the active ingredients will evaporate. So there are two options depending on if you have a good digital food thermometer or not.<br />If you have one, you can simply put any kind of oil into a pot with your extracts and keep that at just over 106°C for like a minute, stir that shit up and you&#039;re done.<br />If you don&#039;t have a thermometer, you need to mix the oil and extracts in a heat conductive container (so preferably metal) and put that container into a boiling water bath in a pot. The problem with that is that the temperature will never exceed 100°C and the decarboxylation process will take much longer. You&#039;ll probably have to let the container in the water bath for about an hour.

				Yeah I don&#039;t think I&#039;m gonna bother with edibles anymore. I&#039;ve bought a few different cookies on SR and none of them have really done anything. <br />It could be that sellers aren&#039;t making them potent enough in order to make more money, so I guess I&#039;ll only find out if I make them myself.
