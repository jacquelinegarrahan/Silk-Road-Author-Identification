				Hey gang,<br /><br />So the other day me and a buddy were bored and looking for websites that would sell Rx or other drugs that weren&#039;t the Silkroad (mostly for fun but I was interested to see if there were any questionable clearnet sites doing this kind of thing).<br /><br />In case what I&#039;m asking for is ambiguous: I know some places something like codeine or tramadol isn&#039;t scheduled but other places it is. So does anybody know of websites where you can get &quot;soft&quot; drugs to play around with or use? Another example would be a website that might sell muscle relaxers. I didn&#039;t have any luck finding any sites that looked very promising but thought I&#039;d ask the road to see if they had any recommendations. <br /><br />Reply here or PM me with any suggestions/experiences!<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				There a tons of clearnet sites that sell xanax, klonopin, somas, tramadol, boner meds and all schedule 5 drugs.&nbsp; They are all over the place.&nbsp; There are clearnet email sources too.&nbsp; Clearnet sites generally cost more than Silk Road.&nbsp; Email sources are a lot cheaper than clearnet sites and the good ones are cheaper than Silk Road.&nbsp; That is where all of the bulk xanax vendors get their xanax...

				@Jack -- That&#039;s the kinds of stuff I&#039;m talking about but like you said: there&#039;s dozens of sites but which ones are reliable?&nbsp; I&#039;m not familiar with IOPs or NROPs (neither the terms or in regards to business). <br /><br />SR is different in that it is not one company selling a bunch of items but rather a host-site for a bunch of vendors to sell their items (which are then rated by buyers). I have not found any comparable means on the clearnet.
