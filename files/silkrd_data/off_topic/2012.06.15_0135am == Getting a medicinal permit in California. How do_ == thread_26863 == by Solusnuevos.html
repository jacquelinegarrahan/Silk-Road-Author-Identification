				Hey, at the moment I am thinking about moving to California, mainly due to the semi legalization of weed if you have a &#039;medical&#039; need. So I am wondering, how easy is it to get a permit? And also, if anybody could give me any tips to getting a permit. <br /><br />Last thing, if a thread like this has already been made, please link me to it :D<br />Cheers<br />

				Pretty sure there are dispensaries with doctors attached, you pay $50 and they give you a card. That&#039;s how it used to be anyway, it might have changed

Weed should be legal for everyone to enjoy, so who cares if he has to lie in order to relax? Wine can help prevent coronary heart disease, but that sure as hell isn&#039;t the reason I drink it. ;) Would you rather have an innocent man thrown in prison then have him smoke some beautiful medical marijuana, because I wouldn&#039;t? Or have him risk injury attempting to buy it from some wannabe gangster? In my defense I live in a much more strict state regarding medical marijuana and acquired my card for completely legitimate reasons, so don&#039;t go lecturing me after this.<br /><br />Back on topic, just check the local papers there or even the internet for shady doctors. Go in prepared with some cliched stoner problem like &#039;night blindness&#039; and it&#039;ll be a cinch. Enjoy the perks of being legal my friend, because they are numerous! ^-^ <br /><br /><br />Edit: On another note, it&#039;s not like he&#039;s abusing the system to score some possible addictive or harmful pharmaceutical pill like Oxycontin. No offense to oxy-abusers. ;)

				To get your 215, just go to a cannabis Dr. for your script.<br /><br />They&#039;re easy to find in CA. Make an appointment if you want but they&#039;ll probably take walk-ins. <br />Mine did. I went in on the way back from the DMV as soon as I got my license. Not even photo ID yet... just the paper card with my sig.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get a physical evaluation. MAKE SURE TO SAY YOU HAVE NO HISTORY OF HEART CONDITIONS when they ask.<br /><br />It&#039;s just for chronic back pain, spasms, anxiety, sleep, appetite... whatever ails you. I suffer from ailments due to a serious accident, so I&#039;m legit.<br /><br />Make sure to get a handy card for your wallet. It saves me a lot of trouble because I can&#039;t keep my paperwork with me.<br />The card ( it&#039;s paper, not laminated ) covers you for possession and especially when you want to become a member of a new club.<br /><br />Edit; Cost me about $100<br /><br />&nbsp;

				The easiest way to get one is to look for a Dr. that &quot;specializes&quot; in MMJ (ie. doc420.com) you walk in and tell them you have really bad insomnia and the only thing that puts you to sleep is marijuana. They try to talk you out of it and try to prescribe you sleeping pills but you tell them straight up that you hate taking pills and the idea of taking a pill every night just to sleep sickens you. Then you&#039;ll be out with a medical card and you can go and shop wherever your heart desires.
