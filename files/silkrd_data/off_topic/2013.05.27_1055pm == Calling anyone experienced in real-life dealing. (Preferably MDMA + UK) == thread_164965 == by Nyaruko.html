				I&#039;m running low on funds at the moment and am going to consider starting to re-sell large MDMA purchases to turn some potentially large profit, but I have never done any form of dealing before so I am calling out for help, any information is highly appreciated.<br /><br />The way I look at it and based on the connections I have, I&#039;ve got two choices. I either sell in larger quantities to small dealers (10g, 25g, 50g) where all trades would be set up by a friend of mine, or I would sell in small quantities (1g at a time) to users, which I think would be riskier in the sense that I would gain a reputation and would have to travel more often. On the flip-side, if I trade larger amounts and am caught I would be in a monumentally larger amount of trouble with the law.<br /><br />Any tips?<br />

				Guess it depends a little bit on how much product you have? If you have 500+ grams probably selling to middle dealers is the go, otherwise if less than a couple hundred grams I&#039;d just go for selling to users for greater profitability.<br /><br />You may want to look at the local laws where you are to see if selling grams compared to 20 grams makes for a different penalty. You may even be better off making your own caps and selling those.

				if you can trust your guy I agree with seafront, if you dont trust him completely 100% start off small - you will make a larger profit and eventually you will probably meet someone who will want to buy in bulk

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />@seafrog92; I think that would probably be the best idea, but I don&#039;t want to get into this too heavily, hopefully it will be a single-summer endeavour.<br /><br />@kneotac; I&#039;d probably be consider selling around a total of 200g of MDMA throughout this entire summer, provided I sell to small scale dealers. Locally, people are willing to buy 25g of high-purity MDMA for around £750-£800. I would be very elaborate in my proceedings, I&#039;d like to think I wouldn&#039;t get easily caught.<br /><br />@titsmcgee123; I definitely do trust him, so that shouldn&#039;t be an issue. Although I probably would make a larger profit selling on an individual basis, I don&#039;t think I can be bothered with the hassle.<br /><br />@StExo; That&#039;s a plausible method of distributing, however I don&#039;t have any people I know/could trust that would carry this out. However if you have any other tips specific to carrying through with large trades I&#039;d really appreciate it.

				i used to sell coke and pot, in bulk and to a few end users (ONLY friends!). pretty much all of it applies here: <br /><br />first port of call whichever you decide, bulk or small: get a throwaway phone. do ALL of your business on this. turn it off when you are done for the night or you will get calls at 3am from gurning wrecks expecting you to be up and still sort them out. soon as someone you don&#039;t want rings you on it, find out who gave them the number, then throw the whole thing away (in a river/furnace/something that completely DESTROYS it) and get another, then give your new number to everyone except the fucker thats giving your number out. when you run into him again either explain if he does it again he&#039;s going to get hurt or you don&#039;t do it any more.<br /><br />don&#039;t keep ANYTHING in the house, no powder/crystals, no cash, no bags/wraps and no scales. i used to pay someone £100 a week to keep my LOCKED box around there house, so they couldn&#039;t pinch a bit if they got tempted. a lockable cash box is what i used. only visit this house once a day, and at least stay for 1 cuppa so you&#039;re not just in and out of there (looks sus) - i used to weigh out all my bits there and chuck her a coupla lines for the trouble. if you sell out do not be tempted to go back on the same day.<br /><br />DON&#039;T serve up in pubs or clubs - you get frisked/pulled by dogs on the door you are FUCKED. Don&#039;t deal from your car - you don&#039;t need customers knowing what you drive - i&#039;ve had a customer drive past me and point me out to his boss before saying &#039;i get my gear off them&#039;. he forgot he had another of my customers in the back seat. needless to say he didn&#039;t after i found that out. don&#039;t deal from your house. do i really need to elaborate on this one?<br /><br />if you meet customers in their house park in the next street and try to not just rush in and out. this looks incredibly sus<br /><br />once you have a customer base you&#039;re happy with explain the rules - you don&#039;t go into busy areas with your gear, you&#039;ll see them before they go out or not at all.<br /><br />once you have a decent customer base don&#039;t take any more on, unless you&#039;ve met them before (with nothing on you) and you have at least 2 existing customers that can vouch for them.<br /><br />try to organise your work nights into one big run - you&#039;ll see customer 1 at 6.45, cust. 2 at 7, cust 3 at 7.30. basically try to make sure you&#039;ve got nothing on you for more than 2 hours a night. drop the cash at your drop the next day when you pick your next lot of deliveries up. will save hours of going backwards and forwards in the long run<br /><br />don&#039;t tic. ANYONE.<br /><br />DON&#039;T cut your product if you want them coming back.<br /><br />Don&#039;t deal with dickheads - any muppet that doesn&#039;t know the meaning of subtle will not be worth the £50/£100/whatever you earn from them<br /><br />if you&#039;re going to be late, text the customer as soon as you know you aren&#039;t going to make it on time.<br /><br />dont tell ANYONE (apart from if they work for you) what you are doing. don&#039;t tell ANYONE AT ALL how much you&#039;re earning.<br /><br />don&#039;t underestimate the authorities - despite most people on here saying they are thick as 2 short planks, they DO know what to look out for. a lot of them are a bit dim, but some are right on the ball.<br /><br />don&#039;t be surprised to shit yourself every time you see/hear a siren or a squad car - i haven&#039;t dealt to end users for a few years now and i can still spot them a mile off.<br /><br />if you only have 200g for the whole summer i would stick to selling to end users; if you&#039;re getting that sort of $ for under an ounce you&#039;re going to get a much higher markup selling g&#039;s, and 200g goes surprisingly quickly.<br /><br />be safe mate<br /><br />/lecture<br />

				Worked for me for years mate, although I was pretty lucky - everyone&#039;s got nicknames ain&#039;t they? Well after I did one particular thing my mates put a spin on my nickname which made it something completely different, and I started using that for business. That way only the close mates could have made the connection and essentially there&#039;s someone new on the scene doing the rounds. And like I said before, I stayed away from my home town when I was selling. It&#039;s not that difficult

				The two lads I buy weed from are bait as fuck. Very rarely change cars or telephone numbers (one has had the same number for like 5 years) and when you call them they drive to wherever you are pull up, get a Tupperware box full of 1.5g bags out and hand you one out the window. Maybe if it&#039;s a particularly busy street they&#039;ll ask you to get in the car first. They do both use nicknames but that&#039;s about it! I know one of them sells mandy too but I&#039;ve never bought that from him.<br /><br />So it seems the police don&#039;t see it as a major priority, the main risk would probably be getting robbed and possibly beaten too. I suppose the thing to do would be not keep any product in your house and not let anyone you don&#039;t trust get in your car if you&#039;re gonna do it that way.

				First of all, if you are low on funds dealing is not the answer. <br /><br />IME, people who depend on it as income tend to be a little riskier, and not have the ability to &quot;flush everything and drop it&quot; if the time comes that that is necessarry. Don&#039;t depend on your dealing profits to live your life, it will bite you in the ass.<br /><br />Other than that, set out rules and stick to them. Always.<br /><br />

Drug dealers writing paragraphs about the ridiculous safety precautions they took, and then profiling themselves to a stupid extent by giving away pretty much every detail about a court case?

				From 20 years experience, here is some knowledge I&#039;ve gained<br /><br />#1 - Positivity<br /><br />My number one rule. Giving thanks for the opportunity to live the way I do, every day<br /><br />#2 - Keeping yourself safe<br /><br />This covers many aspects such as:<br /><br />- Throw away phones<br /><br />At any one time I have at least 3 phones ready to be used and take the place of an old one. They are a dime a dozen these days, and a must. They only contain the numbers of my business associates, and are never used for any other reason (not even to chat with my business partners) other than coordinating a transaction.<br /><br />- Communication<br /><br />I only deal with a few people (mid level people I guess you&#039;d call them) and we arrange ways of communication face to face before anything else takes place. For example, when I have product in stock, the only message Ill send to them is one such as &#039;hey man, would you like to grab a bite to eat some time?&#039;. From that one message, they will know the time and place (which we prearranged) to meet up. That one message is the only communication that will ever pass between us, unless a) they are under duress, in which case they will respond with something like &#039;yes&#039;, or b) they cant make it at that particular time, in which they&#039;ll respond with with something like &#039;no&#039;.<br /><br />Ive also found an invaluable practice is to lay down some ground rules for the people you sell to. Talk to them in confidence, and let them understand how you operate and how you would like them to operate for maximum joy and efficiency. This will be at your discretion, and whatever you consider aids you in staying safe.<br /><br />- Choose your people wisely<br /><br />I found out the hard way when I was very young, how much of a biggie this is. Do not sell to idiots. Do not sell to people that run their mouths (especially at gatherings, parties etc). Do not sell to people that have any kind of addiction or habit. Do not sell to people with gang affiliations. Do not sell to people that cant abide by your rules.<br /><br />- Finger prints<br /><br />For all packages that I pass on, I always bag everything up using gloves or at least make sure they are wiped down.<br /><br />#3 - Get the money<br /><br />Always get paid in cash, NO IOU&#039;S. This of course is all circumstantial, and will be different with each person and situation, but as a general rule of thumb, always get paid - PRODUCT FOR MONEY. Out of my entire existence as a provider of goods for the last 20 years, people owing me money has caused the most frustration.<br /><br />#4 - Don&#039;t get greedy<br /><br />You are not a kingpin, gangsta, right hand man to a manufacturer or government agency, but are a regular person (or so I&#039;m assuming) trying to eek out a little capital to make ends meet, help people along the way, and buy some toys. To lead such a life, you don&#039;t need that next big score, or the final score that will set you up for life. Keep it small, somewhat consistent, and things will go a lot smoother for you. 90% of the people Ive witnessed who have been greedy and try to go big, have ended up in jail or worse. Its just not worth it unless you have many factors on your side. Keep it simple, less is more.<br /><br />All of these things are in no particular order come to think of it, as they are all integral in maintaining a solid enterprise.<br /><br />Good luck out there!<br /><br />PE

				I actually spoke to one of the aforementioned local dealers about this sort of thing yesterday. Apparently one of his friends got caught with over a kilo of weed in his car all bagged up into teenths and got a slap on the wrist, so that further reinforced my incline that the police don&#039;t really give that much of a shit when it comes to weed. More likely they&#039;ll do someone for it if they&#039;re already strongly suspected of other crimes, I reckon.<br /><br />I&#039;m considering doing something similar myself by ordering in bulk from SR and selling it on in smaller amounts (only to make a nice little extra on the side rather than having it as my only income) but for obvious reasons, I want to be as prepared as possible rather than learning as I go along!
