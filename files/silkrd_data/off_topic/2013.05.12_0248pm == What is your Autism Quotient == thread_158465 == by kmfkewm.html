				I fairly frequently see people here (often trolls) making the claim that SR has a lot of autistic people on it. This got me curious, so I decided to make a poll. The following test determines your Autism Quotient. I suggest taking it over Tor and posting your results if you want to.<br /><br />http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html<br /><br />28 is my score

				The majority of Autistic people (80%) have an AQ of 32+&nbsp; , only 2% of control groups (people without Autism in this case) score 32 or higher. The possibility of Aspergers is said to start at 26+.<br /><br />Average females score 15 and average males score 17, with increasing score correlating positively with probability of receiving a diagnosis of Autism. Computer scientists and mathematicians average score is 21.

The reason mathematicians and computer scientists have such a high average score is probably due to the fact that they tend to be Autistic as well. There is a definite correlation between Autism and Engineering. Some people have also argued a link between Autism and Atheism, although this is controversial (I definitely see it). Personally I think that Autism, Engineering, Atheism and Libertarianism are all going to positively correlate, although I have only seen research linking Autism to Atheism (controversial) and Engineering.&nbsp;

High functioning Autistic people are superior in areas that are important to engineering. High functioning Autism often is a trade off between systemizing and empathizing. Most people are roughly equally adept at empathizing and systemizing, high functioning autistic people tend to be above average or even superior at systemizing while showing deficiencies in empathizing. Engineers deal with systems, not people, so having an above average or superior ability to understand systems is beneficial to engineers. It is also likely that people with systemizing minds are more likely to be interested in engineering in the first place. Of course there is a balance to be had, a mildly autistic person may be infatuated with cameras and want to learn everything they can about how they work, while not having much interest in interacting with their peers. A person with more severe Autism might be infatuated with cameras and start to memorize all of the model numbers of cameras without learning anything very valuable about cameras in general. A person with even more severe Autism might not even understand what the word camera associates with. The higher functioning autistic person who has an intent focus on learning how cameras work likely also has natural abilities that are beneficial for engineering tasks while having a lack of ability when it comes to peer interaction, whereas the more Autistic person may have an excellent rote memory for camera model numbers but not be particularly adept at engineering cameras. <br /><br />High functioning autistic people tend to have above average to superior verbal intelligence while having below average visual intelligence, low functioning autistic people are more likely to have the opposite of this or to have below average IQ of both subtypes. Having narrow interests, extreme focus on details and certain intelligence characteristics can result in performing substantially above average at certain tasks. However, if the focus gets too narrow or superficial or the intelligence gap too large and GIQ drops below average, there is no longer a benefit. Certainly no engineers have low functioning autism. <br /><br /><br />http://aut.sagepub.com/content/1/1/101<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Autism is a severe childhood neuropsychiatric condition with a substantial genetic component. At the cognitive level children with autism are impaired in the development of their folk psychology, seict while they are normal or even superior in the development of their folk physics. We predicted that if their parent shared this cognitive phenotype, then they should be over-represented in engineering as an occupation. This prediction was confirmed. Both fathers and grand-fathers of children with autism were found more than twice as often in the field of engineering, compared with fathers and grandfathers of other children. This link between autism and engineering may throw light not only on autism itself, but ultimately on the genetic basis of two essential human abilities: folk psychology and folk physics. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/baron-cohen_pr.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It is another focus of his research, though, that has made Baron-Cohen an occasionally controversial figure. In 1997, he and his colleagues looked for and found some evidence of a link between autism in children and a propensity for engineering in their parents. Further work with students at Cambridge has suggested that engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists have a way of thinking that is quantifiably &quot;more autistic&quot; than that of their peers in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. To some, this sounds like a medicalized stigmatization of nerdiness. Others fear that linking children&#039;s disabilities to their parents&#039; inclinations is a new way of blaming the parent. Baron-Cohen rejects this. He argues that linking the styles of thinking that society has come to value is helpful, not harmful. Minds come in different shapes just as bodies do, and we must learn to accept that. Indeed, we must learn to value it. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Autism is now seen as largely genetic in origin. But that leads to a seeming contradiction: One would expect genes that cause the disability not to be very good at getting transmitted to future generations.<br /><br />Everything seems to be conspiring against the genes to persist, because they&#039;re interfering with social relationships, which are usually a prerequisite for reproduction. But if the genes for autism are persisting in the gene pool, it may be that in milder forms attributes of autism are adaptive. They&#039;re maladaptive in some circumstances - in conditions where social sensitivity is important - but they may be very adaptive in other environments, for example where high systemizing might be needed.<br /><br />This led you to look at the parents of people with autism, and in some early research you found that, like their children, these parents are better than average at &quot;embedded figures&quot; tests, which involve picking specific geometrical shapes out of complex pictures. Did that surprise you?<br /><br />I was impressed by the degree of talent. Among both individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger and their parents, many are superfast at spotting details. You hardly have time to get the experimental materials out on the table before they&#039;ve spotted the target. You&#039;ve hardly managed to get the stopwatch going. The normal brain, as it were, takes much longer. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The studies linking Autism to Atheism are less established and much more controversial.<br /><br />http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/psyched/201205/does-autism-lead-atheism<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Jesse Bering, in a 2002 paper, noted that in autobiographical accounts written by people with high-functioning autism, God is more a principle than a person. He/it provides order but isn’t much concerned with human affairs—the idea of him satisfies the intellect rather than the emotions. Temple Grandin, for example, described God as the entanglement of millions of interacting particles.<br /><br />In line with such a conception of the divine, Simon Baron-Cohen, who proposed the mindblindness theory of autism, told me that “sometimes I meet people with autism who are religious, but their motivation is driven more by the rules (the system) in theology rather than the anthropomorphizing.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When people see an event as divine intervention, or a result of intelligent design, they’re just letting their teleological bias run amok. They’re attributing purpose where there is none. Bethany Heywood, in collaboration with Jesse Bering, found in her Ph.D. research that even atheists tend to say that certain things happened to them “for a reason,” e.g., to teach them a lesson. But subjects with Asperger’s gave significantly fewer teleological responses than a control group did, and several even expressed confusion regarding the questions about purpose. One, misinterpreting a prompt for “a coincidence you saw meaning in,” wrote, “in practical application, I wear nice clothes and make my hair presentable. Coincidentally people are more friendly towards me.”<br /><br />The strongest connection between atheism and autism before now was a paper presented at a conference last year by Catherine Caldwell-Harris and collaborators at Boston University. Survey respondents with high-functioning autism were more likely than control subjects to be atheists and less likely to belong to an organized religion. (They were also more likely to have religious ideas of their own construction, perhaps something similar to Temple Grandin’s.) And atheists were higher on the autistic spectrum than Christians and Jews. But the researchers were not able to demonstrate that mentalizing deficits were responsible for the connection.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

An IQ test showing a large discrepancy between verbal and visual IQ is a big sign of being on the autistic spectrum,&nbsp; if there is no sign of brain damage. The questionnaires tend to look an awful lot like this one although with developmental history also taken into consideration. I think that this test is good for basic screening for Autism. One research paper claimed that scoring below 26 definitely rules out a diagnosis of Aspergers. However the test is not meant to be diagnostic. On the other hand, when this test was being evaluated, only 2% of neurotypical people scored 32 or higher. So I think scoring 32 or higher strongly indicates Autism, and scoring 26 or higher indicates a possibility of Aspergers.

Most high functioning Autistic people do have significant deficits on specific sorts of intelligence tests, but they make up for it by having very superior skill on other specific sorts of intelligence tests, which balances out their general IQ (or even raises it to above average). High functioning autism is sort of like being a genius at specific things and retarded at specific things at the same time. Most people are average at everything, and have an average GIQ. High functioning autistic people are more likely to be really good at some things and really bad at other things, and have an average GIQ. Low functioning autistic people tend to be mentally retarded on all tests, but have a discrepancy between subtests, whereas someone without Autism but with mental retardation would score about equally as low on all tests.

I also have exceptional verbal memory although poor visual memory. It is a bit of a risk though, it is very easy to completely memorize a complex paper but actually understanding it is more of a challenge. It seems that the more Autistic a person is the more the trade off between memorizing and understanding increases (in favor of memorizing). Thankfully I am able to understand complex things, but I can almost always verbally memorize them first.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have read about some Autistic people who are so good at one type of memory that they can mask deficiencies in other types of memory. For example, someone with very poor long term visual memory, but genius level long term verbal memory, could encode a picture with words. So if they are presented with a picture, they could remember it with words, and then if they are asked questions about the picture half an hour later they could describe it without actually remembering it visually. This could be perceived as them having adequate long term visual memory, when in reality they just have exceptional long term verbal memory. Most people would visually recall the image in their minds and answer the questions about it using their mental image as a reference, but someone who can remember words verbatim but who struggles to recall images, could encode the entire picture to words and then answer questions about it based off of their stored verbal information. There are of course more specialized tests that can get around this though. There are actually a lot of examples of people with high functioning Autism using what would normally be horribly inefficient methodologies to&nbsp; successfully complete tests with average+ scores. This is due to them having extremely well developed abilities in areas that do not normally map directly to the test they are presented with, and poorly developed abilities in areas that normally map directly to the test (ie: using exceptional long term verbal memory to appear to have average long term visual memory).

				It is really interesting how the human mind is, between different people the approach they take to solving the same problem can vary enormously. On a reverse digit span test for example, the subject is briefly presented with a series of numbers one at a time and then asked to repeat the numbers backwards. There are two primary ways in which this problem can be solved. Some people will visualize the numbers as they are presented to them, and then read them backwards from short term visual memory. Other people will loop the numbers in their mind, for example with the series: 1, 5, 11, 20, 12<br /><br />they would say in their mind: 1, then 1, 5, then 1, 5, 11 then 1, 5, 11, 20 then 1, 5, 11, 20, 12 <br /><br />then they would repeat the series verbally in their mind until coming to the next number to say:<br /><br />1, 5, 11, 20, say 12<br />1, 5, 11, say 20<br />1, 5, say 11<br />1, say 5<br />say 1<br /><br />I am very good at this test and use the verbal short term memory method (I believe it is called phonological looping, whereas the visual method is called visuospatial sketching). <br /><br />Another example would be if you are asked to say &#039;what letter comes after x in the alphabet?&#039;<br /><br />some people visually recall the letters of the alphabet and simply look at the letter to the right of x. Others would recite the alphabet quickly in their mind: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, say y <br /><br /><br />

Something to look into today...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is really a bit hard to piece together because there are so many different perspectives people look at Autism from (with some of them conflicting), some studies have conflicting results, and Autism itself is somewhat poorly defined and is a broad spectrum with many possible characteristics and ways of presenting itself (and its subtypes are equally poorly defined, with widely varying and conflicting descriptions across academic papers). For example, Aspergers (which I am pretty sure is now rolled into high functioning autism and is not an independent diagnosis anymore) tend to have low visual intelligence and high verbal intelligence, but many studies simply say &quot;Autistic people&quot; tend to have higher visual intelligence than verbal intelligence. I can also find papers saying that Aspergers and High Functioning Autism (HFA) are BOTH types of high functioning autism (not HFA) with HFA people having visual intelligence strengths and verbal weaknesses, and Aspergers people having verbal strengths and visual weaknesses. Certainly low functioning Autistic savants tend to have exceptional long term visual memory while having very poor verbal memory, and people with aspergers (which is a type of high functioning autism, but possibly not HFA depending on who you ask) tend to have exceptional verbal memories with poor visual memories. The only conclusion I can really come to from reading papers on this subject, is that the people studying these things have widely varying opinions, use widely varying language and are generally very disorganized. ( Then again I guess I am expected to have knowledge of physics and a lack of ability to understand psychology, so maybe the issue is with me ;) )&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Here is an article about the visual intelligence of people with Autism. I imagine they studied people with low functioning Autism, although it does not specifically say so. I assume they mean low functioning autistic people simply because people with Aspergers have the opposite cognitive profile (ie: they have poor visual processing abilities and superior verbal processing abilities). <br /><br />http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110404093149.htm<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Autism: Exceptional Visual Abilities Explained<br /><br />Apr. 5, 2011 — Researchers directed by Dr. Laurent Mottron at the University of Montreal&#039;s Centre for Excellence in Pervasive Development Disorders (CETEDUM) have determined that people with autism concentrate more brain resources in the areas associated with visual detection and identification, and conversely, have less activity in the areas used to plan and control thoughts and actions. This might explain their outstanding capacities in visual tasks.<br /><br />Aiming to understand why autistic individuals have strong abilities in terms of processing visual information, the researchers collated 15 years of data that covered the ways autistic brain works when interpreting faces, objects and written words. The data came from 26 independent brain imaging studies that looked at a total of 357 autistic and 370 non-autistic individuals. &quot;Through this meta-analysis, we were able to observe that autistics exhibit more activity in the temporal and occipital regions and less activity in frontal cortex than non-autistics. The identified temporal and occipital regions are typically involved in perceiving and recognizing patterns and objects. The reported frontal areas subserve higher cognitive functions such as decision making, cognitive control, planning and execution,&#039;&#039; explained first author Fabienne Samson, who is also affiliated with the CETEDUM<br /><br />&quot;This stronger engagement of the visual processing brain areas in autism is consistent with the well documented enhanced visuo-spatial abilities in this population,&quot; Samson said. The current findings suggest a general functional reorganization of the brain in favor of perception processes -- the processes by which information is recorded the brain. This allows autistic individuals to successfully perform, albeit in their own way, higher-level cognitive tasks that would usually require a strong involvement of frontal areas in typical individuals. These are tasks that require reasoning -- for example, a research participant would be asked if a statement is true or false, or to categorize a range of objects into groups.<br /><br />&quot;We synthesized the results of neuroimaging studies using visual stimuli from across the world. The results are strong enough to remain true despite the variability between the research designs, samples and tasks, making the perceptual account of autistic cognition currently the most validated model,&quot; Mottron said. &quot;The stronger engagement of the visual system, whatever the task, represents the first physiological confirmation that enhanced perceptual processing is a core feature of neural organization in this population. We now have a very strong statement about autism functioning which may be ground for cognitive accounts of autistic perception, learning, memory and reasoning.&quot; This finding shows that the autistic brain successfully adapt by reallocating brain areas to visual perception, and offers many new lines of enquiry with regards to developmental brain plasticity and visual expertise in autistics.<br /><br />Dr. Isabelle Soulières of the CETEDUM and the Neural Systems Group at the Massachusetts General Hospital (NSGMGH) and Dr.Thomas Zeffiro of the NSGMGH, also contributed to the findings. The CETEDUM is based at the University of Montreal affiliated Rivière-des-Prairies Hospital and is part of the Fernand-Seguin Research Centre. It is officially known as Centre d&#039;Excellence en Troubles Envahissants du Développement de l&#039;Université de Montréal. The research was financed in part by grants from Autism Speaks, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the Fonds de la Recherche en Santé du Québec.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />

In fact, Aaron seemed content to play with his toy dinosaur, a replica of a stegosaurus whose name, his mother laughingly told the staff, was “Amph.” Whenever Ms. Kelly or another teacher attempted to get him to join the group, Aaron pulled away, as if physical contact and closeness burned his skin. But when, by the end of the second week, Aaron was no more engaged with the group than he was initially, Ms. Kelly firmly explained to him that he needed to participate in a game of musical chairs. As she gently removed Amph from Aaron’s hands, he met her eyes with an expression of pain, confusion, even betrayal. Though Ms. Kelly tried to soothe him, Aaron’s tantrum escalated. He appeared not to hear or even to be aware of other people trying to talk to him. Eventually, he was removed from the classroom.<br /><br />Later that day, when Aaron’s mother came to pick him up, Ms. Kelly discussed Aaron’s behavior. “He can be stubborn,” Aaron’s mother agreed. “He won’t learn manners,” she said, describing how Aaron interrupted people in the midst of conversation with a monologue on his favorite topic, dinosaurs. Aaron’s tantrums at home also disturbed and baffled his mother. Many times she couldn’t figure out what they were about, but she had noticed that they occurred most frequently when they were leaving the house.<br /><br />Based on this conversation, it was clear to Ms. Kelly that Aaron’s problems were not confined to the center. When asked what his pediatrician had to say about Aaron’s behavior, Aaron’s mother confessed that he had recommended that her son see a psychiatrist, who could prescribe him medication to alleviate some of his problematic symptoms. “But I didn’t want my son on drugs,” she said. Nevertheless, Aaron’s mother agreed to allow a psychologist to evaluate Aaron.<br /><br />The psychologist administered a sophisticated and exhaustive series of psychological, neuropsychological, and educational tests. Fortunately for Aaron, his family, and his teachers, this psychologist had evaluated children whose behaviors were similar to Aaron’s. With a verbal IQ of 140 and a full scale score of 122, Aaron did not fit the standard profile of a child with autism. Neither could he be categorized as “Oppositional-Defiant,” or ADHD, or obsessive-compulsive, though he exhibited signs of each of these diagnoses. The psychologist concluded that Aaron was one of a growing number of children with Asperger’s Syndrome.<br /><br />Children With Asperger’s Syndrome<br />Every teacher knows children like Aaron. They’re “different,” “strange,” “eccentric.” They don’t fit in. They grow up to become the brainy kids, the computer “geeks,” socially aloof and alone. Though it may not have felt so to his mother at the time, Aaron was lucky to have been diagnosed so swiftly. Many children with Asperger’s Syndrome are initially misdiagnosed and thus treatment, however well-intentioned, is misguided and involves medication targeting one or more symptoms without taking the entire condition into account. Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) is a neurologically based developmental disorder marked primarily by qualitative impairments in social interaction, communication, and behavior (Tanguay, Robertson, &amp; Derrick, 1998). Named after Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician who first identified the disorder in the 1940s, AS affects as many as one in 300 children. It is very rarely recognized before the age of three, and is thought to be far more common in males than females (Porter, 1996).<br /><br />Asperger’s Syndrome is considered by many mental health experts to belong to the spectrum of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), and is often used synonymously with “high functioning autism” (Williams, 1995). Other experts believe that the characteristics of AS are different enough from autism to warrant its own category of diagnosis. With a later onset, less severe social and communication impairments, and a higher verbal IQ than autism, the diagnosis of AS implies a more promising prognosis, and therefore affects both treatment modes and outcome. Whether the diagnosis ultimately exists in its own category or not, the numbers of people being diagnosed with AS—children and adults alike—is steadily ising (Autistic Association of New Zealand, 1998). “Asperger’s Syndrome is such an inconsistently used term,” says Fran Goldfarb, Director of Parent &amp; Family Resources at the Center for Child Development at Children’s Hospital-Los Angeles (personal communication, May 18, 1998). “The terminology, more than anything, tends to confuse people.”<br /><br />According to Stephen Bauer, M.D., from the Developmental Unit of the Genessee Hospital in Rochester, NY, “For each case of more typical autism, [mainstream] schools can expect to encounter several children with a picture of AS” (1997). For this reason, teachers’ awareness of this syndrome is increasingly critical, not only in order to conference effectively with parents around their children’s educational needs, but to be able to work directly with these students on a daily basis. Children with AS can be tremendously challenging to teachers. The more education, empathy, and support the teacher brings to bear on this situation, the better the child and the classroom as a whole will fare.<br /><br />Features of Asperger’s Syndrome<br />Asperger’s Syndrome is a disorder that affects a child’s social, behavioral, speech/language, and physical abilities. The following are some common features of the disorder, divided by areas of strength and weaknesses, as compiled from articles by Ruth M. Ryan, M.D. (1992); Stephen Bauer, M.D., (1997); Amy Klin, Ph.D., (1994); Karen Williams (1995); the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition; the O.A.S.I.S. (On-line Asperger Syndrome Information and Support Home Page, updated 1998); the Asperger’s Syndrome Support Network Homepage (updated in September 1996); and the Autistic Association of New Zealand, Inc. (1998).<br /><br />Areas of Strength<br /><br /><br />Children diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have excellent rote memory;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Absorb information and facts easily;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have an average or above-average intelligence (IQ);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are usually verbally advanced;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are extremely gifted in specific areas such as math, science, music, and art;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are academically proficient in several subjects including reading, vocabulary, and memory skills;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have the ability to focus on an area of interest, albeit to the exclusion of other interests and activities;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are intensely curious about their particular areas of interest, albeit to the exclusion of other areas; and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Can be absorbed into mainstream education with appropriate support services.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Areas of Difficulty<br />Although children with AS have many strengths, they also have areas of difficulty which make interaction with others and learning difficult. These areas are listed below.<br /><br />In social situations, children with Asperger’s Syndrome<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Play in solitaire or with much younger or older children;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Exhibit a lack of empathy or ability to see others’ point of view ;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Demonstrate a lack of awareness of how their behavior affects others;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Show absence of spontaneous interest in sharing experiences with others (they live in “their own world”);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have inappropriate behavioral and emotional responses to social situations (i.e., laughing at something sad);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Suffer impairment in non-verbal expression (limited facial expressions and social cues; limited use of gesture, and inability to judge appropriate social distances);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have limited and/or missing non-verbal communication; and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are often teased and bullied by peers because they cannot perceive that others are fooling or manipulating them.<br /><br />Behaviorally, children with AS<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Exhibit restricted and repetitive, often bizarre patterns of behavior, interests, and activities (these routines or rituals may be imposed on self and/or on others);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Display repetitive movements, mannerisms, and vocalizations;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Develop unusually intense attachment to particular possessions;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Lack the ability to explain motivations, feelings, or reactions;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Show inflexibility and rigidity of routine (when they are met with a change in plan or with a surprise, even a pleasant one, they become extremely anxious and upset); and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Lack the ability to tolerate frustration, often resulting in emotional outbursts.<br /><br />Children with AS display speech and language difficulties by<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking in peculiar voices (monotone, machine-like);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Not understanding metaphor/simile, figurative language, and abstractions (everything needs to be very concrete); and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Expressing difficulty in holding give-and-take conversations.<br /><br />Physically, children with Asperger’s Syndrome<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Are clumsy and ill-coordinated (unusual gait or stance);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Avoid and may become overwhelmed and confused by phsical contact with others” (Cesaroni &amp; Garber, 1991);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Have gross or fine motor impairment which may affect penmanship, keyboard manipulation, and drawing; and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Utilize relatively little eye contact.<br /><br />Students with Asperger’s Syndrome can also have erratic and irregular results from educational and psychological testing. A child with autism or AS “may be a ‘math whiz’ in algebra, but not able to make simple change at a cash register.” Or, he or she may have an astonishing memory for statistics or prose, but forget to bring his or her supplies to class day after day. “Uneven skills development is a hallmark of autism” (Moreno, &amp; O’Neal, 1998).<br /><br />Sensory Overload<br />An additional, fundamental feature of Asperger’s Syndrome is a hypersensitivity to external stimuli. People with AS may hear things more acutely than the average person, feel things more sharply, and smell things with exaggerated intensity. Thus they are often in a state of sensory overload. In her paper, “My Experiences with Visual Thinking, Sensory Problems and Communication Difficulties,” Temple Grandlin (1996) describes her experiences with autism. “Sudden loud noises hurt my ears, like a dentist’s drill hitting a nerve,” she writes. “Being touched sent a...tidal wave of stimulation through my body. I wanted to feel the comforting feeling of being held, but the effect on my nervous system was overwhelming.” She writes, “The fear [or anticipation] of a noise that hurts the ears is often the cause of many bad behaviors and tantrums.” Her revelations make accessible and understandable what would otherwise be incomprehensible to most of us.<br /><br />Suggestions for Early Childhood Professionals<br />For each of the areas of difficulty, Williams (1995) outlines ways for teachers to deal with the AS child in the mainstream classroom. (Another invaluable resource, written from the perspective of an adult person with Asperger’s Syndrome, is the article by Temple Grandlin, Ph.D., “Teaching Tips for Children and Adults With Autism,”http://www.autism.org/asperger.html.) While there is not room here to enumerate them all, the following are some basic guidelines for helping teachers deal with the AS child in their classroom.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Minimize transitions by anticipating and preparing the child for any change in routine or schedule and avoid surprises.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Explain why. AS children do not have the intuitive ability to see that their behavior is insensitive or inappropriate. They need to be told why in very concrete terms.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Help AS children develop self-consciousness around behavior that is socially insensitive or inappropriate by explaining the reaction their behavior elicits, why their behavior offended people, and why it would have been better to behave in a specifically defined alternative way in the future. Help them to “practice” this alternative way.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Learn to differentiate between what the child can help and what he or she cannot help, behaviorally, emotionally, or socially. Speaking at length, regularly, with the parents is invaluable towards this end.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The combination of firm expectations and flexibility is necessary with the AS child. Provide choices, but limit them. In addition, require that they follow the rules of the classroom, and learn to sense where their rigidity can and cannot be loosened.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; To the best of your ability, protect the child from bullying and teasing by peers. Aside from the obvious aim of avoiding hurt feelings, peer insensitivity can be an opportunity to teach and model empathy, even to do some role playing. AS children can also learn to “mimic” empathetic responses.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Limit their tendency to perseverate on circumscribed areas of interest by designating a specific time during which they may discuss or ask questions about the topic. Likewise, use their interest area as a reward for completing assigned tasks.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Be calm, predictable, and matter-of-fact in interactions with the child with AS, indicating compassion and patience. It will be “necessary to teach children [with AS] seemingly obvious things...” (Asperger, 1991).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Be positive. Be creative. Be flexible” (Moreno, &amp; O’Neal, 1998).<br /><br />Therapy, Medication, or Behavioral Modification?<br />No one knows better than professional educators that every child is an individual. Children with Asperger’s Syndrome are no exception. Each one exhibits his or her own cluster of behaviors and traits, some of which may be more attributable to inherent personality characteristics than to a feature of the Asperger’s disorder. Likewise, treatment for AS will be different with each child. Some will benefit from medication for problems having to do with attention, or anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Others do not seem to benefit from medication, but respond well to a supportive behavioral approach to their idiosyncratic ways of experiencing and dealing with the world. A therapist experienced in working with AS children and their families is invaluable. Teachers may find themselves in a position of having to refer the families for consultation to a mental health professional. At times they may have to deal with a degree of family denial. Therefore, your role in recognizing and supporting the family in dealing with their child is crucial.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />With the ever-increasing number of children in mainstream educational settings being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, teachers and parents need to come together around the special academic, social, and emotional needs of the AS child. Parents are rightfully concerned that the bureaucracy of educational planning committees is not equipped to accommodate their children’s unique needs. Cognitively and academically, these students are, if anything, advanced, making them ill-suited for most special education programs. On the other hand, the emotional and social challenges of the mainstream school setting can be extremely taxing for AS children and their teachers. Education and awareness are the first steps towards a sympathetic and effective program for these frequently gifted children with special emotional and social needs. What’s singularly important to remember is that the AS child experiences the world in a high-volume way, uniquely and creatively. The more we can learn from them about patience, compassion, and empathy, the more we will all benefit.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />However these articles are rather cherry picked to support my initial hypothesis that people with low functioning Autism are more likely to have exceptional visual memories&nbsp; (although many are retarded in all areas) and people with high functioning autism are more likely to have exceptional verbal memories. Unfortunately, when it comes to Autism disorders, it is pretty much possible to find plenty of research supporting nearly any hypothesis you want to throw out there. I do believe that this is an accurate point of view though.

You&#039;ll have to normalize the two sets of scores, because they have different ranges, means and standard deviations. You do that by converting each score to a &quot;standard deviation unit&quot;.<br /><br />If they&#039;re not different and/or we score higher on the longer quiz too, find 30 random people on the street and give them the quiz, then do a t-test to see if that difference is real. On a small sample, like 30 people, a 6 point difference could be a fluke, ie not a real difference, especially given that huge range from 6 to 42.<br /><br />This is science! :)<br />

				It is not that autism is more pronounced on here. Not specifically. There is some correlation between autism and geeks, probably. I mean all kinds of neurological issues aren&#039;t uniformly distributed throughout the populace, just look at the genetic problems Jews and only Jews seem to get. But what we&#039;re seeing is that people who actively use (or even lurk) internet forums in general are not part of the general population anyway. <br /><br />If this test produced a different result from the set of Facebook users, I should be more surprised. But I am not surprised at all that an internet forum has different results because it is obvious that less than 10% of the population accounts for 90% of what is written online. Half the population uses the Internet exclusively for porn and videos on YouTube. This is why it seems elsewhere on the internet everybody online loves cats and Ron Paul. It&#039;s like expecting an IQ survey of Usenet users in the old days to follow a normal distribution, when it is was clearly the inverse! <br /><br />Even ignoring the rest of the net, even on SR the majority of people don&#039;t seem to use the forums. Technocracy! Soon we shall evolve into Morlocks and farm Facebook users... oh wait.

First off, it&#039;s very difficult to self-diagnose (arguably impossible) and secondly, it&#039;s very difficult to make an accurate diagnosis while drug use is occurring. Anyways, these are good thoughts. Thanks for putting em out there :)

				I scored 32.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t have a mathematical mind, just the contrary in fact. I have a very strong visual capability, however. I make mental pictures of everything I see and remember them by that. I have a very strong visual imagination (for example when I painted I used to paint above the visual image I visualized in the canvas).<br /><br />So I have 32 in this test with an IQ of 151, I guess I&#039;m totally insane (oh well, not that I didn&#039;t know that already anyway).

				16.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually heavily into the sciences as a hobby and profession, but I don&#039;t seem &quot;nerdy&quot; unless you get me on the topic.<br /><br />The real skinny:<br />These claims are made by people who view getting on the net to buy drugs as asocial. To an extent, they are correct. However, there&#039;s also two other dimensions they fail to neglect:<br /><br />1) Some people are natural introverts.&nbsp; I&#039;m a huge introvert; I love time alone.&nbsp; A lot of these questions had introvert bias. &quot;Do you prefer doing things along&quot; fuck&nbsp; yes, it&#039;s amazing. <br /><br />2) This is actually a safer way to distribute, and I&#039;m glad that people here seem to be of higher intelligence than the average dealer. Would I rather a &quot;semi-autistic&quot; dealer with good knowledge of stealth and security or a socialite dealer who gives me an awkward fucking handshake in broad daylight while looking as sketchy as possible? Option A please.<br /><br />Fuck these tests.
