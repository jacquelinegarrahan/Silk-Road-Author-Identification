				I really hate the fact that I&#039;m slightly allergic/hyper-sensitive to the morphine family. I somehow want to try out a pill or two of every pain killer to see which one would work the best with my body without going through the doctor. But my moral side lectures me about the ethics of it. It&#039;s really annoying. Does anyone here have the same experience? It&#039;s almost like I&#039;m afraid of getting addicted and go through the process of withdrawal but sometime in the near future I&#039;ll need painkillers for my joints (early arthritis in knees/back)&nbsp; and I don&#039;t want to explain myself to every single doctor I come across without them thinking that I&#039;m a drug seeker/addict.

But it&#039;s awesomely painful during the &quot;attacks&quot;. I am stockpiling oxycodone, Norco and maybe one more which I don&#039;t remember the name right now, because I don&#039;t have health insurance and I do not plan on going to the hospital again the next time it strikes; just tough it out at home. I know enough about it to know I run no risk doing this.<br /><br />Now to you and your fear of getting hooked. It&#039;s baseless, you&#039;d have to pop pills in a medium to high dose every day for weeks before you&#039;d start to feel the twinges of one, tolerance, which would make you increase the dosage, and two, withdrawal symptoms if you stop. <br /><br />The important thing is to just try one of the opiates for a couple of days, and see what it does or doesn&#039;t do. Then stop. Get another one and try it for the same length of time, and stop. That&#039;s it. And this thing about morality doesn&#039;t enter into it at all. What&#039;s moral or immoral about taking a medication, for pain yet? That&#039;s silly.<br /><br />Start on it, don&#039;t wait until you have to suffer.<br /><br />MockFrog

				I know where you are coming from. Just be careful because dependance can be just as bad as addiction and if you are going to take opiates on a regular basis then dependance is unavoidable and the addiction is all you. You still go through withdrawals even with simple dependance. I got prescribed 8 mg dilaudid for my joint pains by a crooked ass pain management doctor and I was excited at first because I knew I could easily live off the profits of my script but i was quickly finding that I was wanting to hold on to them rather than sell them and thats when I knew I had an issue so I stopped the script.

				I really don&#039;t think you can get dependent taking opiates on an infrequent basis. But if you took them every single day and found that teh pain returned right away if you stopped, then you&#039;d have a problem.<br /><br />MockFrog
