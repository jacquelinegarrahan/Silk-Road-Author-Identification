				Okay, so I purchased 10 grams of what was labelled as &quot;Amber shatter&quot; and showed a picture of some stable shatter. I made this purchase for a client who is moving away, and wants to take a lot of high quality stable shatter with him. So when I receive the package, the concentrate&#039;s pretty gooey and soupy. A consistency more of sap, than shatter. Knowing how concentrates react with heat, I figured it was gooey from it&#039;s transit through USPS. I pop it in the freezer for a good half hour, then take it out and it&#039;s nice and hard. Within 5 minutes it&#039;s back to being gooey, sticky, and difficult to work with. If you touch it with your fingers it will stick and be really difficult to get off. My client sees this and says he doesn&#039;t want it, because he specifically requested shatter. I purposely made my purchase from this guy because the product described shatter, but I did not receive shatter at all. The vendor has a sap listing and a shatter listing, and I purchased the shatter listing. Should I take this to resolution? Here am I now with 10 grams of gooey sap that I really planned on selling. If I had known what I was going to receive, I wouldn&#039;t of ever placed the order. I need some assistance in what to do next. I&#039;ve already contacted the vendor, and am now awaiting a response.<br /><br />Update: <br />Vendor responded saying that the resolution center was for packages that didn&#039;t arrive not for my scenario. If that&#039;s the case then the escrow system is really flawed and implies vendors only have to send a package, regardless of what&#039;s in it.<br />

				In all honesty, it really doesnt matter what a vendor puts on his profile page regarding refunds and what not. SR Staff decides what happens thats why the escrow system is there. The reason of your dispute though is the hardest to dispute because you did receive a package.

				Give your vendor some time to respond. Perhaps they sent you the wrong item by mistake and will make it right. Maybe they can tell you how to correct the problem yourself. If they have a good reputation here then it is highly likely you will walk away satisfied.

				He&#039;s yet to respond yet, but I&#039;ll update when he does. If I could send the package back and get a full refund I would, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s an option for obvious reasons.<br /><br />

				Definitely sounds like the vendor sent you the wrong item. Any good vendor will find a solution, it happened to me once and I was sent the correct item for free but this was a considerably lower amount of product. I&#039;m sure it will be solved. :)

				Vendor&#039;s reply: <br />&quot;All our stuff has snapped for us at 60-65 degrees. Resolution is if you don&#039;t recieve the product. Im sorry this was your experience but I clearly state that be aware it is summer and it wll be less stable by definition. Resolution is for not recieving the product, not for your client not excepting it... &quot;<br /><br />I replied stating that it wasn&#039;t solely about my client not accepting it, but the fact I received something totally different than advertised. I tested it at his temperatures and the sap never &quot;snapped.&quot; I left it in a fridge at 55 degrees for a half hour, when I took it out it still wasn&#039;t stable.<br /><br />It seems escrow is pretty flawed if it&#039;s only for when a package doesn&#039;t arrive, that implies a vendor can send anything as long as there&#039;s still a package.

After receiving messages from other people who received the same low quality product from the same vendor and are upset, I contacted DPR for clarification on the resolution center. Hopefully we can get this worked out in a decent manner. I&#039;d settle with a 50% refund because I don&#039;t want to do harm to the vendor, but it&#039;s not fair at all he sent such a product instead of what he advertised.

				Good luck on getting it sorted mate...I am waiting on a some mdma and after I already placed the order people started discussng that what this vendor is sending out is testing as bk-mdma so I have to go buy a test kit to make sure this is not the case. I will be really upset and angry if this vendor is sending out something other than what is advertised :/ GL

How ... loyal of you. Remind me NOT to buy anything from you, ever. BTW, your buddy crumbwriggle is a deadbeat who is frequently begging for money on the spare coins thread. You are kissing the wrong ass. He&#039;s looking to get something for free and I don&#039;t think any vendor should want that in a customer.<br /><br />I order shatter all the time. crumbwriggle is a most likely a scammer (and a sock puppet of my namesake) trying to extort something out of this poor vendor. To be honest -if this was in the real world like at a restaurant or something: IT WOULD BE AT THE VENDORS DISCRETION TO OFFER A REFUND. If I go to the Taco Shack and I don&#039;t like the Taco -I don&#039;t get a refund. I may bitch on Yelp -AND THAT&#039;S WHAT THE PRODUCT REVIEWS ARE FOR.<br /><br />BTW, if anyone agrees with me please only give NEGATIVE KARMA for me TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.<br /><br />

				Other then leaving a review and a rating...<br /><br />I&#039;d say put your sap on a peace of parchment paper and heat it on a skillet... Careful not to get to hot (if memory serves in the area of 185-200F).&nbsp; You want it close to the boiling point of water, but not much more so.&nbsp; Then just move it around and lift one corner and let it run, trying to spread it out thin etc...&nbsp; It should get thicker and thicker as the unwanted water content is released.&nbsp; And as it gets thicker it should also become clearer.&nbsp; Once clear, you should be pretty well done.<br /><br />Then just use a nice clean edge and make whatever shape you like.. then put it in the freezer for a few minutes and presto, chango.... You might have shatter. lol<br /><br />OH... I&#039;m not an expert, and This may not work.. But in theory it should.

How ... loyal of you. Remind me NOT to buy anything from you, ever. BTW, your buddy crumbwriggle is a deadbeat who is frequently begging for money on the spare coins thread. You are kissing the wrong ass. He&#039;s looking to get something for free and I don&#039;t think any vendor should want that in a customer.<br /><br />I order shatter all the time. crumbwriggle is a most likely a scammer (and a sock puppet of my namesake) trying to extort something out of this poor vendor. To be honest -if this was in the real world like at a restaurant or something: IT WOULD BE AT THE VENDORS DISCRETION TO OFFER A REFUND. If I go to the Taco Shack and I don&#039;t like the Taco -I don&#039;t get a refund.

Nobody takes you serious as you are obviously a troll trying to start drama. Do us all a favor and find the nearest balcony and jump off of it. Also in regards to your &quot;begging&quot; accusations, you&#039;re known on here for being a pathetic beggar who is blacklisted from the spare coins thread for not repaying debts. You realize every time you talk you look more idiotic.<br /><br />1 more day and I&#039;ll take the case to resolution. I&#039;ll be sure to update. Thanks for the opinions guys, you&#039;ve re-assured me that the Silk Road administrative team will do the right thing.

				Hello Crumbwiggle...<br /><br />As a top vendor here on SR....I offer you my opinion......I could send you shatter and with the hot weather were are having in 3-4 days in transit it will become wax......It has happened to me&nbsp; this year.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the product if that is the case.&nbsp; As far as going to SR resolution, since you received the product....I am not really sure what you expect to happen in SR resolution....but you have the product.....while i understand you do not think it&#039;s correct....that does not change the fact you have it......there is a pretty fine line between wax and shatter.....we make batches 2 times a week....and there are lots of factors that effect how the wax goes into shatter, wax, or sap........My advice.....ask the vendor politely if he will offer you something....and do not go to resolution.....if you go and lose....and then leave the vendor a 1/5.....you will land on the vendors black list .....most likely.......<br /><br />Now I know you do no want to hear that......but believe me.....it&#039;s best to come to a resolution with the vendor and just move on.........Now I will step back and say .....I do not know you.....or the vendor.........those are just my thoughts....<br /><br />Good Luck

It&#039;s black goo. And I know heat can morph the states of concentrates, but I put it into the freezer and it stayed a waxy goo. In the picture and product description he promised a stable, translucent slab. It&#039;s such a pain in the ass this is even a problem. I&#039;ve already spoken with the vendor numerous times all he&#039;ll offer is extra on my next order. I&#039;m obviously not planning on ordering again from him though considering how this one played out. I&#039;m considering just cutting my losses and finalizing, but then the vendor ones. He&#039;s successfully scammed another person, I have other people who&#039;ve contacted me with the same problem from the same vendor.
