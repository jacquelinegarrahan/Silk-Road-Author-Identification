				I run a fairly small scale supply chain, and along with that I&#039;m a very analytical person and I&#039;d like to keep track of various statistics including (but not limited to)<br />1) Current inventory<br />2) What the inventory cost me<br />3) Sales I&#039;ve made (size of sale, how much the total sale was for, potentially a dealer code to keep track of which dealers are doing best??)<br />4) Various statistics about how much each unit has sold for, what type of drug it was, etc<br />5) Projected income ranges if all inventory sells (range from a bunch of small sales to a few large sales and their prices)<br /><br />Also I&#039;d like this software to keep the data encrypted for obvious reasons.&nbsp; I primarily use a mac, but I could use windows software, however web based software for this would be the best, so I could throw it on some random/anonymous server (freedom hosting??) and connect to/manage it via the tor network along with my business partner.<br /><br />Anybody have/use something like this?

				If you had any experience with programming, then you could easily write one yourself?<br />I would, but i really haven&#039;t got the time :P<br /><br />Locker.
