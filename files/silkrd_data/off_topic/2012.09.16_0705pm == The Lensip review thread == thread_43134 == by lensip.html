				Welcome Lensip. Great to see an Irish vendor here on the road :) <br /><br />I&#039;d be delighted to get some domestic valium and trips. <br />Since you are new, the minimum order of 100 valium is a little high for me to test the waters, so will wait until I see a few reviews.<br /><br />When I have enough BTC for a large order and I see some good reviews, i&#039;ll be a customer for sure.<br /><br />All the best with the venture,<br /><br />Psy

Very happy camper indeed, and I got an extra tablet as well :)<br />The order came so fast, I can&#039;t even finalize it yet, due to Lensip being a new vendor.<br /><br />Package was more than sufficient for a domestic order.

Due to the price, I&#039;m not too worried about strength, though wouldn&#039;t mind if it were strong of course :) <br /><br />Anyways, here&#039;s hoping it all goes through and it shows up.

				Hey everyone,&nbsp; sorry for the late review.&nbsp; I finally got a chance to try lensip&#039;s hofmann LSD.&nbsp; I took the one hit that he sent for the sample and went to a DJ show.&nbsp; I decided not to do mdma with everyone else and just to do the acid so I could gauge the potency.&nbsp; It took about an hour for me to feel it and I still could feel it after the show about 5-7 hours later.&nbsp; I did have oev at some point during the light show and it continued until a little after the show, but I don&#039;t know how long into the trip it was since I don&#039;t take a phone or watch out when I trip.&nbsp; The dosing I feel is correct at about 100ug or so.&nbsp; Definitely didn&#039;t feel any RC&#039;s in the mix.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only wish I would have had another one to intensify the visuals and mental focus, but overall it was very pleasant.&nbsp; Thanks Lensip.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				So far liking the cut of lensip&#039;s jib. I placed an order for 100 of the Hofmann blotters yesterday I believe. Already in transit with registered mail, so far the communication has been A+ and I cant wait for my tabs to get here. I will most defiantly post on the tabs strength and purity as i like to do a reagent test on arrival. So far so good, if these tabs turn out well I will defiantly be a repeat customer.

				Package just made its way into the USA. Hopefully it&#039;s not a controlled delivery as it is 100 tabs. If my normal postal lady delivers it, we are in the clear and I will soon be testing it. Doubtful the LSD would be found in the package if it was very stealthy, it&#039;s not like it has an odor to pick up. Here&#039;s to hoping as i still have to sign for it due to registered mail.

Sometimes you get lucky and it only sits there a couple days but seems like here lately all of my packages have been sitting there for a week or 2 before moving. My guess is that with Christmas coming up they&#039;re starting to get backed up more. I placed a order with lensip on the 27th he shipped it the same day and it arrived at the ISC usps sort facility that same day! guess where it is now? The ISC usps sort facility! Lol our postal service blows....<br /><br />Heres a thread on the clearnet of people waiting on packages that hit the New York ISC usps sort facility:<br />http://www.pharmacyreviewer.com/forum/shipping-tracking-discussion/24421-ny-sort-facility-131.html<br /><br />Most people are claiming their packages are sitting there for 2-3 weeks before moving on. Once it leaves the ISC usps sort facility it should be at your house in 2-3days<br />

				Hi guys,<br /><br />Thanks for all the support and praise. Some of you have been absolutely brilliant!! Thanks to your positive words I have been swapped with emails and orders, it&#039;s been brilliant. So good, that I have to break some bad news. I&#039;m almost totally sold out!!<br /><br />I know some people are monitoring this page for feedback before buying so just wanted to let you know that I expect to be sold out within the next 24hrs.<br /><br />Again, thanks for all your kind words and I hope everyone gets their mail.<br /><br />:)

				Firstly I would like to thank u Lensip for great service :) 100% professionalism! Good contact and what about his acid... It&#039;s really good, compare to Shivas which were about 75ug the Hofmanns are about 90-100ug in my opinion...:) The same bitter like Shivas but after swallowing, just one glass of water and u don&#039;t feel any taste of paintwork or paper... Many visuals, fractals, oev, cev and really deep adventure into myself :) Good Job Lensip and waiting for your next batch of Lucy :)&nbsp;

				Thanks lensip for you being a vendor and for your product. Me and my friends we went on a trip to mountains a couple of days ago. Each of us took 2 hofmanns and after an hour we understood that this is the real deal product;D. At the beginning the taste was a little bit bitter, but it washed down after a glass of water. Many visuals (cev and oev), euphoria and deep thoughts. I sincerely recommend Lensip as your Lucy supplier.<br />-true lsd<br />-shipping time 3 days<br />-excellent communication<br />...and Lensip thanks again for 1 extra hof ;)
