				Ok im bored so i was thinking who would win a war between the U.S.A or the U.K?<br /><br />1. YES ALLIES CAN GET INVOLVED BUT WOULD RUSSIA OR CHINA EVEN WASTE THERE TIME ON USELESS BLOODSHED? THATS THE KEY QUESTION.<br /><br />Im very aware that british soldiers are trained far better than the u.s soldiers however, the u.s has a huge army but if the allies were to get involved the yanks might be in trouble.

				The idea of a war between the UK and the US is unrealistic. These two countries have been the closest of allies for a century. You did, however, mention what I think could be a realistic war in the future.<br /><br />If one looks at the population centers of the two other nations (Russia &amp; China) one can see that the Chinese are closer to much of the resource rich eastern side of Russia. <br /><br />Those two countries are much more likely to go at it than the UK and US, which the US would win as handily as it wanted to.

				lol yea i guess your right honestly im sure we would make minced meat out of the u.k one on one but if the allies stepped in to aid the u.k i think it then becomes a toss up. But would russia or china take the chance at us or just sit back and laugh who knows because i know the u.k and u.s would never fight but idk im just stoned and was thinking about it.

				russia supports iran&#039;s nuclear program, and north korea is working on missles.&nbsp; when the shit hits the fan, it will be russia, iran, north korea, and a few rebel fighters from other mideastern countries, against the u.s. and the u.k.&nbsp; germany is the only country from the e.u. that matters, the rest is already crumbling.&nbsp; and to be honest, i don&#039;t know which way they will lean.&nbsp; china is going to stay out of it as long as they can, but will quit backing the u.s. debt, halting weapon production.&nbsp; israel will stand back as long as they can, since the u.s. is standing back on the iran nuclear situation now.&nbsp; but, i think eventually china will side with russia, iran, and north korea.&nbsp; israel will back the u.s. and the u.k. at that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />meanwhile, central america will have legalized the flow of drugs from south america to the u.s.&nbsp; and interstate 69 is almost complete.&nbsp; this is a super highway from&nbsp; mexico to canada.&nbsp; <br /><br />america won&#039;t be able to rally troups, because the youth is sick of the establishment, and with the fresh supply of dope from south america, will most likely sit back and get stoned, and watch it all burn.&nbsp; or look for safe haven in canada or the netherlands.<br /><br />but, that&#039;s just what it looks like to me.&nbsp; i&#039;ve been wrong before.

				If they ever went to war, you&#039;d have far larger problems to worry about than who would come out of it victorious. Wars aren&#039;t fought with nukes people. Wars are ended with them. If nukes were dropped, I doubt half of you would even be around to see who won.

The UK also has the largest military expenditure in the world (second only to US). It&#039;s not the largest or most advanced military, but it&#039;s certainly up there ranking as a top 5 world power, particularly in terms of air and naval power (the latter of which the UK has always excelled at). The country also has a significant nuclear capability with nuclear armed planes (and many carriers) plus nuclear armed subs, giving the UK a truly global nuclear strike reach (like the US, France and Russia).<br /><br />However, the UK&#039;s military capability would be no match for the US which must be 100 times greater and way more sophisticated. If there was a direct war between the US and UK, the US would win hands down. Being an Island nation heavily dependent on imports too, the US would only need to cut-off trade to the island by blockading Britain&#039;s vital daily sea freight trade links.<br /><br />The only way I could see the UK making any impact against the US would be a pre-emptive all-out strike, a surprise attack. But even then, it&#039;s unlikely to be able to deliver the US military a crippling blow due to its sheer size and the geographical size of US. We saw what happened to Japan when they tried that tactic...they only managed to give the US a bloody nose and wake the sleeping giants anger ;-) And the US military today is far more advanced. They have sophisticated satellite early warning systems, and also strategic military bases all across the world.<br /><br />Summary: The UK attacking the US would be like a wasp stinging a giant who would either squat it, or put a jar over it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Also the UK lacks any land-based intercontinental nukes AFIAK..that means any UK nuclear strike against US would have to be by air or sea. The UK only has 4 nuclear armed subs and so would need to build up a considerable naval fleet in the Atlantic with several carriers to launch a full-scale nuclear strike... even if the UK armed all its fighter jets the distance is too great they would need to refuel on carriers.<br /><br />By the time the UK had this deployed the US would be onto them. These days, any such operations involving deploying nuclear armed subs and carriers in the Atlantic (even training exercises) have to be declared, the US is constantly monitoring. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hold the fuck on there sports-fans. <br /><br />The U.K would clearly win because we could just throw crumpets, scones and the cup of tea at the the U.S which would just confuse the fuck out of the Americans. We did this for 100s of years, built the largest empire in history with crumpets, scones and cups of tea. Also the U.S wouldn&#039;t be able to understand and read our messages because of the dodgy accents like Scouse, Geordie and Yorkshire and they wouldn&#039;t even half get Cockney rhyming slang let alone the Welsh, Scots, Irish or people from the South West. The U.S would be listening in for ages and we could just snatch Obama because they didn&#039;t realize we were saying &quot;Let&#039;s go snatch Obama and use him as a bargaining chip.&quot;<br /><br />Also we have the Queen, you can&#039;t nuke an 80 odd year old woman and on top of that the U.S.A&#039;s Grandma and if the U.S nuked us she would give you one of those &quot;We are not amused.&quot; crossed with &quot;I&#039;m not angry, just disappointed.&quot; looks and there is no way the U.S could resist that shit. <br /><br />Finally if the U.S invaded they wouldn&#039;t be able to hack our eccentricities so they would land, maybe shoot a few tramps and be like &quot;Actually....fuck this little island....there must be something in the water because there is someone over there wearing wellington boots and a flat peak cap and genuinely thinking they look good...&quot;

				I&#039;ve resisted this thread for a while now but i&#039;ve finally given up.<br /><br />Ok to the OP.<br />The USA would win, they have a larger, more sophisticated nuclear arsenal, a much larger army and if they ever looked in trouble they would just deploy it thus destroying the UK. On the subject of allies we can&#039;t just say &#039;oh the EU would side with the UK&#039;, it depends on the circumstances surrounding the war ie who declared war on who and why. If the USA out of the blue declared war on the UK then yes it is a fair assumption that the EU may come to the UK&#039;s aid. Russia would probably be the most vital ally as it has a very large nuclear arsenal as well. But the real crux of the matter is a future world war would most likely be settled by a) nuclear weapons or b) both sides agreeing a truce (the Cold War being the obvious example). If a) occurs the world would be destroyed, not literally as is the earth no longer exists, but all nations would be reduced to 3rd world nations, the US has enough nuclear missiles to pretty much destroy all its opposition and the European nuclear powers have enough to pretty much wipe out the US. Food wouldn&#039;t be able to grow due to radiation effects and water would not be safe to drink (imagine Fallout but IRL), although i think it is perceivable that at least some of the human race may survive, it would set us back many many many years especially in terms of infrastructure.<br /><br />One last point that i felt the need to comment on was this (i hope i quoted it properly);<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19493.msg196610#msg196610">Quote from: simplyanon on April 19, 2012, 03:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> China, well, they might do something, but there goes any chance of the US paying back all that money. China can&#039;t really afford to stop taking money from us at the moment.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>China can&#039;t afford to stop taking money from the US? I must say that this is completely the wrong way round. The USA is hugely in debt, more than any other nation in the world and this debt is only going to increase (at least in the short term). <br /><br />a) if the USA stops getting money from China, the US economy collapses, it cannot currently afford to support itself, its budget is not balanced, it operates a huge trade deficit.<br /><br />b) You mite say &#039;well the US can just borrow money from someone else&#039; ? Well there are two reasons why this isn&#039;t simple. <br />Firstly in the current economic climate who has the money to support loans to the US ? The EU can barely keep Greece up and that is only because of Germany, and Germany are not the biggest supporter of the US so getting financial aid from them is pretty much off the table even if they could afford it. <br />Secondly lets pretend that you are a country that does have enough capital to finance the US&#039;s debt, here is what you see. The US is borrowing more and more money, more money than anyone can comprehend off China (a country whose economy has come from way down to be one of the top 5 in the world and still growing (hard to say if that is correct right now but as a general trend it will be)). Suddenly the US decides it is not going to pay China back, they have defaulted on all there loans, the standard bearers of free market capitalism have spat in it&#039;s face, and now they are asking you for money? You just are not going to lend it them. You are going to keep your money as far away from their hands as possible. And the result ? Again the US economy collapses with unservicable debts of $15trillion+, far far worse than the great depression.<br /><br />Im not saying that China would escape unscathed, of course they would take a huge hit economically, but China are not relying on the interest payments from its loans to the US to survive, China operate a budget surplus with an export surplus, yes it will be hit, but it will carry on and still be a major economy, in fact it would probably be the largest economy in the world as a result.<br /><br /><br />On a little aside how about this for a conspiracy theory;<br />China is the largest &#039;communist&#039; (i use the term weakly because they still operate in a free market) country in the world. They are also the largest lender to the largest capitalist country in the world the USA. If China is to call in its debts, or rank up the interest payments to the point where the USA has to default, the capitalist system collapses.<br />Why is China supporting capitalism; the sign of the end of there communist regime, or a move to destroy capitalism ? ;)<br /><br />

Theres really no grudge between america and the u.k. anymore. most americans dont even know their own history: the inhumane acts committed by the redcoats prior and during the revolution, the war of 1812, the burning of the presidential mansion. that&#039;s all long forgotten now, or at least it doesnt matter at this point. if by some insane chance there actually were another war between the two, america would win; thats not to mean the u.k. wouldn&#039;t be a worthy opponent.
