				I been looking online for a vaporizer. I know and always known that the Volcano Vaporizers are the best. But i dont have 600 for one. now the question is what is the next best thing? ive seen silver surfer, da buhdda, hot box, and others. but so torn with reviews and such. any one here own one and care to share? or borrowed one or used one? i need help with a decision. much appreciated.

				I use an Extreme-Q, but I&#039;m soon moving to a Silver Surfer as I don&#039;t really use the bag function on the Extreme. At the 300 dollar price range, it&#039;s all about what kind of functionality you want. The Extreme-Q comes ready to use the whip, bags, and vapor-bong on an 18mm ground glass connection. The SSV comes with only enough to use a whip, but it&#039;s by far the best whip vaporizer (a little more efficient, especially with the hands free option, also very dense clouds of vapor, some people prefer this). If you want just a unit for bags, the herbalaire is the way to go here. If efficiency is your game, take a look at a Purple Days or a Myrtlezap. If it&#039;s portability, the Magic Flight Launch Box is the best portable smoking unit I use :)<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				If anyone is still interested in my opinion, Vapor Genie is the best that I have tried.&nbsp; Uses a normal lighter.&nbsp; <br /><br />or you could just make your own vape... Cost 5 dollars, works beautifully..<br />Best of all when it is disassembled, very few people could tell what it was used for.&nbsp; (unless it reeks of DMT...)<br /><br />CLEARNET ALERT!!!!!!!<br />http://nawmean.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=9<br /><br />Basically what I&#039;m saying is I think it&#039;s retarded to pay out your ass instead of making something that works just as good and is FAR stealthier.

				I had the v-tower for a while and it was nice. Then I graduated to the volcano three months after that. The volcano is really awesome for parties but not great on your own if you have any fear of getting caught by people living nearby (parents, landlords, neighbors, campus security) because it reeks like a motherfucker and it&#039;s loud, so being stealthy is impossible unlike with almost every other vape. I&#039;ve heard great things about the MFLB and honestly that might be what you&#039;re looking for, especially if you want something that isn&#039;t pricey, but I&#039;ve never been a fan of it.<br /><br />All if you if you haven&#039;t heard should check out the &quot;vapexhale cloud&quot; vaporizer, it&#039;s been in production for a long time and I don&#039;t know if it will ever actually come out, but it looks like it could trump the volcano, and it should be less expensive too.

				I agree with awsume the Arizer V Tower EXTREME Vaporizer is very nice for $180 can&#039;t beat it.<br />The fan is nice and quite too.<br />The IOlite is a very nice portable vape, when you get one that works right.<br />You can vape pretty much next to somebody and they wouldn&#039;t know.<br />Stick the iolite in a cup, and go see a movie or concert.<br /><br />I have own a few others but these so far are my favorites.<br /><br />

Since the DBV is upright it&#039;s a little easier to place in a stealthy spot and it&#039;s already hands-free. It also helps that the heat knob faces you.&nbsp; The bowl is larger than the Purple Days and smaller than the SSV, so it&#039;s a nice balance between smoking bowls efficiently by yourself and being able to handle multiple people. I like the idea of the Purple Days, but you have to leave it plugged-in for awhile before it&#039;s ready so not the best portable choice. DBV can do it all!

				The only thing about the DBV that I don&#039;t like IS the hands free option. I don&#039;t like leaving the herb exposed to the hot air longer than I have to, IME with the Extreme-Q, leaving herb in the hot bowl causes it to get &#039;used up&#039; faster.

				Interesting, I haven&#039;t noticed that problem with the DBV. I&#039;ll load a bowl and hit it here and there throughout the night. I don&#039;t notice the bowl getting used up faster, but maybe I&#039;m not paying enough attention. Anyone else notice that with the DBV? I would think unless you&#039;re drawing air the bud should be ok to sit in the bowl.

				I haven&#039;t personally tested out a DBV to see if it cooks the herb either, but I know that my Extreme-Q definitely does. I actually just ordered a SSV, so maybe if there&#039;s enough interest here I&#039;ll post the review/comparison of both models that I was planning on posting on a popular clearweb forum.

				I use the arizer extreme Q and man it&#039;s awesome, it was my first vape so I did a lot of research and in the end the everyone was saying that the volcano just wasn&#039;t worth it unless you have money to spare. I preheat it for 5 minutes at 220*F and load up the elbow with a good strain and bring it down to 200*F and after 2 minutes it hits so clean and hard it looks like you&#039;re shooting smoke through a fog machine

				The IOlite is also a great choice.&nbsp; When I&#039;m vaping alone, I go with that over the volcano.&nbsp; And it&#039;s extremely portable and efficient.&nbsp; One of the only &quot;flameless&quot; portable vapes, and it doesnt burn your weed like a lot of the other portables so you can save it to smoke later or for hash oil/edibles&nbsp; ;)

				Non-portable vapes are all the same to me (except the volcano, which I don&#039;t really like). For vaping anything anywhere (especially DMT), the vaporgenie is probably the best. The Iolite is good for vaping in crowded public places, since you can put it in a cup and vape through the straw without anyone knowing.

				I&#039;ve personally had decent experience with vape&#039;s from proper portable ones too light bulbs and too volcano&#039;s.. i&#039;m interested in the Extreme Q personally but in the end i believe you really get what you pay for.. there are alot of cheap vapes and portable vapes that sound good but in experience they just don&#039;t do the trick. Volcano is legit but i believe its old,overrated and overpriced..

				Might be one of the most expensive vaps out there, but check out the SUPER VAPEZILLA<br /><br />http://www.phedor.com/Super-Vapezilla-Vaporizer.htm<br /><br />It&#039;s got a digital thermostat, heats up fast (faster than the SSV), has all ceramic heating elements, filtered air, you name it.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty much the Cadillac of vaps. Size is like an external CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Just uses a whip to load and smoke from, also like the SSV. So my $0.02, get the SSV if you&#039;re budget is around $300.&nbsp; If you can go all the way, for $550 get the Super Vapezilla.&nbsp; <br /><br />-------<br /><br />Side note, the thermostat actually helps a LOT by taking the guess work out of getting the perfect plume.&nbsp; You&#039;ll even see how the temp drops (down to the degree) depending on how hard to hit the whip, so the thermostat actually helps you control your breath to the point you&#039;ll get perfect, heady vaps every time.<br /><br />For shits and grins, go back to your SSV after spending some time with the Super Vapezilla and it&#039;ll be like a whole new experience on the SSV.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can buy &#039;em here - http://www.wickedroots.com/Vaporizers/Digital-Vaporizer.html

				Hi Yall..I am also looking for a good vaporizer and have narrowed it down to the Arizer Extreme Q (Ebay - $140) and the IOLite Portable Vaporizer ($140 Amazon). Which one should i go with?<br /><br />I am primarily interested in vaporizers that are silent, good for personal use and dont cost more than 150 bucks.

				I would HIGHLY recommend checking out the Arizer SOLO.&nbsp; It&#039;s a portable vape that&#039;s only been out a couple months.&nbsp; &nbsp;I LOVE IT.&nbsp; It&#039;s battery powered with adjustable temperature settings and glass pathway gives you tasty CLOUDS for such a small machine.&nbsp; It&#039;s about the size of a redbull can and while not as stealthy as the iolite it&#039;s far superior in my opinion. I used to have an Iolite and they have their uses but this thing GIVES YOU SERIOUS CLOUDS.&nbsp; The only drawback of the thing is the battery but they do have a power adaptor for it coming out soon.&nbsp; If you are really serious about looking for a vaporizer you really need to check out fuckcombustion.com&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the most complete board for all things vaporizers.&nbsp; Each model has their own thread so you can read all about them.&nbsp; Any other questions feel free to ask.<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; This is my first post after lurking on here for way too long.&nbsp; It&#039;s good to get out.
