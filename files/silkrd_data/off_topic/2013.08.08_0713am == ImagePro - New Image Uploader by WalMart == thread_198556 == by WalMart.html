				UPDATED 8/8/2013 - 2 VERSIONS AVAILABLE<br /><br />Since Freedom Hosting went down, which is one primary services (well, the provider of many primary services) I use for uploading images since Imgur.com no longer allows uploads over TOR, I decided to create my own. After fearing a DNS, IP, or MAC address leak I ditched my old server (which didn&#039;t have much hosted on it anyways, FH seemed like a secure platform). So, with new hardware* I&#039;m slowly trying to provide services that are needed in the Silk Road and TOR community.<br /><br /><br />My first - Anonymous Image Uploader<br /><br />100% Javascript Free<br />You should still disable Javascript when using TOR.<br />ImagePro V1<br /><br />http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imagepro/<br />This version is very fast but is limited to 1 file per upload session, no change in filename, a maximum final size of 1024x800 (images are resized), and a maximum size of 10240mb<br />ImagePro V2<br /><br />http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imageprov2/<br />This version is slower, but can handle up to 10 sequential file uploads, does not require resizing, renames your file for privacy and duplicate filename issues, and does not output a thumbnail.<br /><br />If you reach a &quot;website cannot be found&quot; error, try going to this address first: http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion:80<br /><br /><br /><br />It&#039;s very minimalistic and doesn&#039;t have many bells and whistles (nearly none) which allows it to maintain decent speed in uploading even behind TOR over VPN. It does not alter your image or add any metadata, but in turn it DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE METADATA. The ImagePro page has a link to an EXIF Stripper I use so users can remove the EXIF data (if they have not already) before they upload.<br /><br />Features &amp; Specs:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; One photo per upload<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 10mb Image Size Limit<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, and .tif<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Regular and thumbnail images are produced<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Regular Image size is 1024x800<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thumbnail size is 256x192<br /><br />I should note that files are uploaded to a public directory, meaning that users can explore all the photos that have been uploaded. For this reason, you should not include a filename that may be used to identify you. This issue has been fixed. You must now use the direct link, and will not be able to explore the directory.<br /><br />Image Directories - These are now private, only a direct link will work.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imagepro/normal/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/imagepro/thumbnail/<br /><br />EXIP Data Remover (stripper.exe)<br /><br />http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion/app/stripper/stripper.exe<br /><br />For now it is the first (and only) working application on my new server, which in light of the Freedom Hosting disaster I decided I should invest in new server hardware.<br /><br />Currently I don&#039;t seem to be able to get the application working with onion.to through the clearweb, but due to security concerns I always recommend users to use TOR and never use a clearnet tunnel. On top of that, I also recommend every TOR user invest in a VPN service. You can find plenty that accept bitcoin and are anonymous. You can then edit Vidalia to run the VPN every time you start TOR.<br /><br />I&#039;ll be getting the forums up next, and then since I have no alternative I&#039;ll host my webstore here as well. The advantage is I&#039;ll be able to integrate BTC Merchant API&#039;s directly into the page with the new server, as the old ones had severe limitations. Of course, I&#039;ll always offer SR escrow, although I am looking into alternate Escrow services (over .onion) for sales outside of SR.<br /><br />This service should not be confused with any other service that may be called ImagePro.<br />

				<br />first off i would like to say thank you. people like you are a huge asset for the community.<br />uploaded a test pic and it works all fine beside the fact that it came out all blurry :P (just kiddin)<br />and then (although i&#039;m sure you already thought about it) i am just curious: how are you going to deal with the pedos? from what i take they just have lost a lot of their dirty pics and are probably desperately looking for places to put them up again. if i were you i wouldn&#039;t want to be the owner of that place (i bet the guy from freedomhost would confirm that ;))

				Saw the new Reddit Post titled ImagePro &amp; ImagePro 2 are back up and at a new location (walmart5natwoa3w.onion): http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1lazal/imagepro_imagepro_2_are_back_up_and_at_a_new/<br />Does this mean the Old One will eventually shut down or just that the new one is functionally better and/or will last longer?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: StExo</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Very good WalMart, in a few hours I will be joining you with another image host! We&#039;ve all known for a long time that the hidden services networks being so dependent on FH is a bad thing and the recent events, thanks to LE, have pushed for more and more services being self-hosted and less vunerable to major attacks and exploits like the one that hit FH and nearly half of all deepweb services.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just wondering did anything come of this? :)

				The old URL is no longer valid, BUT all the old images are located in the same place.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />xxxxxxxxx.onion/apps/imagepro/uploads is the format, as the file structure has not changed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I also added dynamic links for your uploads, so you no longer have to copy/paste the links.

				Just checking if there&#039;s currently any issues with http://walmart5natwoa3w.onion ? It simply says unable to connect. :(<br />If there&#039;s any bandwidth issues and/or Server Issues I might be willing to donate a bit as there isn&#039;t a single other alternative available at the moment to my knowledge.<br /><br />Might have gotten swamped due to influx from the thread Can anybody recomment an Image posting site?: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=211421 :P

However the Service from Walmart is simply down too often to be able to use it consistently, so for now at least we&#039;re switching over until either someone figures out a better option. A service which costs 2-5 € per month would be acceptable if there are no free ones available, if anyone knows of such a site send me a message. :)
