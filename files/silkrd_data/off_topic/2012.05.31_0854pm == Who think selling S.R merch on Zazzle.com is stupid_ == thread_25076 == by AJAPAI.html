				Zazzle.com is a pretty known website wont people think wtf is s.r when they see shirts and what not on there? It could be good for s.r business but will it attract the wrong people?

				I hope this isn&#039;t for real, wow! You might as well have a bag of brown in your pocket and have a custom made SR T-shirt with your username and purchasing stats on it. Plus this will bring unwanted attention... Gives LE&nbsp; an excuse to spend more of their precious time trying to shut down a community that is 100x better then they&#039;ll ever be.
