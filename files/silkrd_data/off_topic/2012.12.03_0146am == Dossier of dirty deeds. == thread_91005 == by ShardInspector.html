				Is anyone else interested in putting together a &#039;dossier&#039; of known Government &#039;dirty deeds&#039; ?<br /><br />All that would have to happen is that people would reply to this thread with instances they are aware of of govt malfeasance and then one day, someone can compile them all into a single document for posterity.<br /><br />Such a document would naturally be representative of what this community perceives to be rightful/wrongful.and therefore unique and valuable<br /><br />History proves they are capable of the most diabolical acts... I&#039;m talking about thing like :<br /><br />- The war on drugs<br />- &#039;Operation Northwoods&#039; (Look on Wikipedia)<br />- The illegal and unsupported by the majority &#039;undeclared&#039; wars being fought presently that are even based on false pretenses<br />- The unlawful warrantless wiretapping of all e-mail and phone calls that, which although now very much public knowledge, the Govt blatantly persists with all while blocking (using dirty delay tactics) legitimate, constitutionally protected court actions aimed at trying to bring them to account.<br />- The fact Government bribes are taking place legally in the form of campaign donations.<br />- The use of &#039;drone&#039; aircraft paid for by the US populations taxes yet used for surveillance of the US population themselves<br />- The spending of billions of dollars on other things while millions literally starve to death and their is no universal health care system<br />- mandatory minimum sentencing (despite every case being different)<br />- The effective reversal of the &#039;burden of proof&#039; in many statutes<br />- That there are no formal sanctions against police who do not act in accordance with their governing legislation.<br />-&nbsp; That there are &#039;fictions&#039; written into statutes. (e.g. rape without any penile penetration or any penetration of the vagina)<br />- Charging minors with crimes &#039;as adults&#039;<br />- The use of indefinite imprisonment<br />- The use of torture<br />- Private court hearings and &#039;Gag orders&#039; amounting to a return of the &#039;star chamber&#039; of England in the 1600&#039;s<br />- Vicarious liability gone insane<br />- The militarization of the police including para-military style operations against unarmed civilians who are only &#039;suspected&#039; of committing a crime.<br />- That there is no punitive accountability for proven judicial misconduct<br />- The massively overinflated benefits senators etc receive upon retirement.<br />- That the state can confiscate a citizens property without any guilty verdict being handed down<br />- That there are crimes even where no identifiable actual victim could possibly be identified and therefore no person has been harmed<br />- That the state and police enforce morality through the law<br />- That there are &#039;thought crimes&#039; accompanied by a official refusal to acknowledge them as such<br />- That children can be placed on a lifetime &#039;sexual offenders&#039; list merely for &#039;possessing&#039; &#039;pictures&#039; of themselves without ever having touched or sexually offended anyone.<br /><br />I propose that if any single member objects to something being listed on &quot;RATIONAL&#039;, not purely emotional or religious grounds that it be removed. that way we will have only listed deeds that we perceive are truly wrongful and therefore &#039;dirty&#039;.<br /><br />Anyone want to add something ?
