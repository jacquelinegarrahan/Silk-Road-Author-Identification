				Well guys heres the skinny. I am not gonna get to detailed but I just got back from three dr today for something that I been thinking about doing since I was real little. a few months ago I met someone that is in transition from becoming a man to a woman. I instantly made friends with her and we have become really good friends. I talked to her bout th is and explained that I had a motive of befriending her that I too feel as a woman inside unfortunately I am very manly and have always had a problem feeling comfortable in my body. Well all that changed due to a shroom trip that opened my eyes a few weeks ago today I met with the dr for the first time answered questions and had blood drawn I feel good that my first steps are over its gonna be a long one but I had to tell someone so why not my friends at sr

				We&#039;re friendly and accepting as long as what you&#039;re talking about is in our comfort zone. We&#039;ll hate you if you are a purveyor of child porn, we, with some exception, wont like you if you sell explosives on here, we&#039;ll be iffy about weapons, and I&#039;m sure there are some other off-limits subjects here. But yeah, good luck and I hope the transition is easy for you

				Bravo for your bravery!&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a few friends transition their gender.&nbsp; Two male to female and one female to male.&nbsp; Just be absolutely sure it IS what you are cause there&#039;s no going back.&nbsp; One of the things one of my friends had to learn was the &quot;training&quot; that we all receive from birth based on our gender.&nbsp; You were trained to be a man, you might need to study up on the small things that all women were trained on.&nbsp; You will also have to accept a new physical weakness once you are castrated (I know guys sorry, don&#039;t cringe) ...your testosterone gives you strength.&nbsp; Without this strength you may feel vulnerable and you will need to get used to that as well and maybe learn new rules of where and when you can go alone (like women shouldn&#039;t be in the park in the night by themselves etc). <br /><br />Anyway, :D&nbsp; good luck and get a good counselor.&nbsp; My friends went to Thailand for the whole package at once (they took step by step pics of the operation that she made us look at ugh), was $15K plus air.<br /><br />The late great Jimmi Hendrix said &quot;I&#039;m the one that&#039;s got to die when it comes time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to!&quot;&nbsp;

				Good luck!<br />I may not be happy with myself, but I don&#039;t think I could ever get plastic surgery of any type.<br />I figure we&#039;re all different for a reason though, and if you feel so different you need surgery to complete yourself, then that is up to you.<br />Kudos on your bravery and focus!

				One thing to think about is to store some sperm before you make the final change, if you go that far.&nbsp; You may want a child someday and you can find a surrogate.
