				I think hes great, just looking at him makes me laugh although this distracts me from what hes saying, maybe that&#039;s the point, he dose have some crackers though, his comment about the olimpics was brilliant and he got away with it. One good thing iv noticed is that when hes in interviews he wont take any shit, hes articulate enough to be insulting&nbsp; without the interviewer being able to pick up on it. <br />Boris and Paxman together are great.

He can actually beat the shit into Paxman as well whereas nobody else really can. And yeah the Olympics comment was epic but it was truly Boris, only he could have made that fly. He&#039;s like the Neo of British politics in my opinion - &quot;There can be only one&quot; :P
