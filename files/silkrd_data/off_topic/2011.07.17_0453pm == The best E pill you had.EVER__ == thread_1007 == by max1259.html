				Im asking this because i saw a question somewhere by a guy saying that all the E&#039;s (pills not MDMA powder/crystals) he&#039;s had for the last few years haven&#039;t been able to touch the heights of the one&#039;s we used to get in early to mid 90&#039;s and i feel exactly the same.<br />&nbsp;Dont get me wrong there not all shit these days but there just seems,well..something missing?<br />The one&#039;s we used to get were mainly Doves,off white with brown speckles in (which we always thought was H but im sure it wasn&#039;t lol) that crumbled really easy or harder ones without the speckles,they were good but no better than a lot of the ones today,a bit trippy,closed eye and open visuals,nothing major,a feel good factor but not big loved up and the crazy thing was you could actually sleep on them?? Not only at the end of the roll but during and everbody said this,they were also a really come down.<br />&nbsp;But they weren&#039;t the best,not by a long shot,one weekend we couldn&#039;t find &quot;Our Man&quot; so had to scout someone else out,met some guy behind a KFC (as you do lol) and he said he had &quot;Chunky Doves&quot; or &quot;Double Doves&quot; They looked like the others but twice as thick,rock hard so made in a good press,no speckles and that just off white colour,but because i&#039;d never seen em before or tried them i only bought a few.biggest mistake of life cos they were the strongest,cleanest,most loved up euphoric roll EVERIiv&#039;e been behind that KFC half of every year looking for him but no joy lol.<br />&nbsp;I rerember playing on a football game in the pub when it hit me,i&#039;d never been able to get to the final of this game but this was the night,i hit the final,played &quot;GOD&quot; and won the world cup lol,walking to the bar felt like i was walking in bouncy castle made of sponge but it felt GREAT,zero paranoia as you&#039;d expect tripping on shrooms etc,i was grinning from ear to ear.<br />&nbsp;We got out from the pub and just couldn&#039;t stop saying how good we felt,drove up to the rave with out heads out the window screaming like bloody banshee&#039;s,what a night,what a rush,only thing is no E has even come close to that since,not even pure MDMA crystals,like i said always something missing,nothing has that BIG Eurphoric hit or really happy tripping your balls off feeling,or maybe it&#039;s just me but a lot of people have said it.<br />&nbsp;I keep thinking that either that particular pill maybe was mixed with something like really strong coke or some really good 2c-whatever?? Or maybe it wasn&#039;t even MDMA at all,never tried MDA so maybe that,if anyone can think what it might have been or mixed with let me know cos i want some more ha ha.<br />&nbsp;Post with your best E pill and when so if there&#039;s any great one&#039;s around now we know what to get.<br />Cheers<br />Max

				Best pills I had is a toss up between pink dinosaurs and radioactives (radiation symbol), both in mid-90s. The dinosaurs were tiny and dead trippy and 1 lasted all night (definitely not just MDMA, but bloody good) and the radioactives were just strong as fuck and made your eyeballs wiggle!

				I couldn&#039;t pin-point my best, but I surely can describe my worst:) <br />My wife (then she was just my gf) and I took I think only 1 each, or maybe 1.5 each... It was uber strong, i remember laying in my room listening to music, when suddenly, the door opens, and here come my parents, my grandparents, my sister, my.. woow! nothing, im alone in this room, pff, i lay my head down, my door opens and here come my parents, my grandparents, my sister, my.... Daaamn, I get up, go to check on my gf - she&#039;s at the other room listening to music too, I hardly can walk - she sez, can you pass me the water, I say ok, and, then she asks me, what the hell are you doing in the wall dresser - and I have no Idea.. I try to pick up the bottle of water - and they just seem to appear out of nowhere and stack on the stable... After that trip we stopped doing e for.. hm.. maybe 3 years... Ah, no, we took last pill one evening after maybe one in a half year.. and I asked her to marry me then;), well technically we were engaged for some time, but that evening on E I said - to hell with it, let&#039;s do it, she said ok.. and we got married:). So now, when someone asks &quot;..oo, how did he proposed?&quot; I always answer &#039;ah, you know, took some drugs, mind got deluded..&#039; or &#039;aw, this time I was on drugs, and asked her&quot;.. Then everyone say &quot;ha, ha, not funny, so how was it&quot;... &quot;Well it was on a see shore, near the lighthouse...&lt;...&gt;&quot; ... This part is true too, but the final decision _was_ made on E;) So here you go - one of my worst trips, and one of my best decisions were inspired with the same E;) <br />So answering your question - I think it&#039;s not that the E was better back then - everything was, it&#039;s called nostalgia, and as everyone knows back in the 90&#039; even nostalgia was deeper;). Each and every trip i think is as good as your mindset at that particular moment and as the people that are around at that moment.. Provided that the product is good enough=)

				Personally, no pills or powders ever matched the magic of those first few pills. I&#039;ve taken better quality stuff since but it just never reached the same level from that first (or second) roll. Sigh.

				dont remember the print but i bought them of a lucky lucky man (African guys selling sun glasses by the beach) in Ibiza in around 2005. Back home i was doing 9-10 pills on a friday night, half of one of these had my jaw swinging watching Sven Vath, coming across other people as loved up as me was fun! Never felt such a smooth soft yet excited and loved up high. I expected them to be crap, nice surprise. never found the same guy again.

				not had a decent pill ever i think, only mediocre ones, only had decent results with crystal, but then i stopped buying pills a few years ago after a good run of total crap, although there were a few dark years in the end of the 00s where there were literally no quality drugs on the street, even getting green that wasnt coated with some poisonous crap was a rare thing, the only vestige was RCs, thankfully its all over now and thank to this place im getting hold of stuff that i thought id never get to try<br /><br />incidentally that hasnt helped me in the last 2 weekends, last weekend a friend got some 2-ct-7 however his scales didnt turn up, no way we were risking a guess on a low dose chem like that, so nothing for that weekend, i then decided id take charge and get a mad one going this weekend, the plan was a good old fashioned candyflip with some dizzers for the crash, as it was all the uk sellers were out of acid, the dizzers were out of stock from the seller i purchased from and the molly didnt turn up in time so another boring weekend ahead :( my grand plan failed spectacularly, which isnt uncommon for me really! (im sure someone will say it may turn up tomorrow, but i have zero faith in the saturday post here, i think ive only ever had one letter arrive on a saturday) and on top of that the bud situation locally is drier than the sahara, july officially sucks, can we just skip to august already?

				ah pretty much anything from the late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s was spot on, or maybe i&#039;m just looking back through rose tinted glasses...<br /><br />doves (the double doves OP mentions we used to call superdoves, but they were quite a lot later iirc)<br />crowns<br />elephants<br />playboys<br />rhubarb and custard capsules (back then capsules sometimes even came in blister packs, proper pharma style!)<br /><br />And then mid-late 90&#039;s, just as pretty much everyone had given up on the chance of ever having a good pill ever again, along came mitsubishis and everyone&#039;s faith was restored for a couple of years.
