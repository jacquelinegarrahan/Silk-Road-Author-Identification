				I posted awhile ago on product request forums that I&#039;m looking for fluni&#039;s, my favorite benzo by far. Its been awhile since I took them, so i mentioned in the post that I would pay top dollar for anybody who can get ahold of flunitrazepam or qualuudes. Well I guess this bastard got greedy and saw dollar signs because this is what he PM&#039;d me (like 3 times). Yea maybe if I was a newbie I&#039;d fall for this shit but I think it&#039;s hilarious that he would scroll over my post and see that I have like 300 posts in the forums and maybe figure out that I may have heard of one or two of these kinda scams in my time here. What a fuckin retard. And I&#039;m posting this up as a warning to anybody who might get a similiar message..<br />Well heres the PM I got:<br /><br />hey sofish89,<br /><br />just saw a post about flunis from you. therefore:<br /><br />I HAVE FLUNITRAZEPAM FROM CENTRAFARM! ONE BOX CONTAINS 3O TABLETS WITH 2 MG!<br /><br />because of the 500 € bond for a seller account on sr and the insane 10%<br />fee i&#039;m only a buyer at sr. but my account is reliable (100 % success<br />rate with 17 trades). if you are interested i can give you my sr-nick to<br />check my stats. but i don&#039;t know if you can see my stats on sr if you<br />don&#039;t&nbsp; have a vendor-account.<br />you could buy 3 (minimum) or 4 boxes. 3 boxes cost 3.5 btc, 4 boxes 4.5<br />btc (related to the current course of 95 € or 130 $; if the course sinks<br />you have to pay more btc, when it goes up you pay less btc.. but the<br />amount of 333 € (that&#039;s 455 $) for 3 boxes and 428 € (that&#039;s 585 $) for<br />4 boxes is fix. these prices sound hard, but they aren&#039;t. this benzo is<br />extremely rare and i spent a lot of money for them. especially the 2 mg<br />version i have is extremely rare. and as you may know it&#039;s the best<br />benzo of all. they have exactly the same effects like original rohypnol.<br />the tablets are white, tiny and they melt very fast (less than 30 seconds).<br /><br />for example: a few weeks ago i saw an american vendor at bmr who sold<br />original rohypnol (1 mg) for 30 €/ 39 $ for one single tablet!!! they<br />were sold out rapidly. who is that dumb?!<br /><br />if the bitcoin-trade with a not registered seller is too hot for you we<br />could deal this with paypal. this would be very safe for you because<br />paypal gives your money back if i wouldn&#039;t send your goods. but bitcoins<br />would be much smoother and anonymous. so i&#039;d prefer bitcoins if nothing<br />speaks against it.<br />next term: i give no refunds if the package gets lost after sending it<br />or the customs catch it. if you want i ship it with a tracking number.<br />btw: i ship from germany and i recommend that only buyers from the<br />european union buy this stuff because i&#039;m not able to make the package<br />perfectly stealthy. but if you tell me how to do this i can send it<br />worldwide.<br />when you don&#039;t trust me i would do anything that you can trust me. i<br />could make a foto, give you my phone number and my real address. if you<br />have any further idea to identify me as legit, please tell me. i&#039;m sure<br />we could find a way.<br /><br />NOTE: I HAVE ONLY THESE 4 BOXES TO SELL AND THIS MESSAGE IS SENT TO<br />NEARLY EVERYBODY IN THE FORUM WHO POSTED THAT HE WANTS FLUNIS. THE<br />FASTEST GUY WINS!&nbsp; &nbsp;THE NEXT AND BIGGER AMOUNT WILL TAKE A FEW MONTHS.<br /><br />e-mail: danki@gmx.net<br /><br />if you want to encrypt your message here is my pgp-key:<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v1.4.13 (MingW32)<br />Comment: Gnu Privacy Tools<br />Comment: Download at http://www.gnupt.de<br /><br />mQENBFD8Xt4BCACzYH0E9AvfQmlQ9M2uYZ9ITO7CL1Fx5GAsuWErY8G26XQ9MlQY<br />LE+EdUvJueiSIC52Shyc7dKntgTySmC/3BD4TDBh+86HZeSRucsTQ6P7DQrNrr1G<br />0P/wLIVZscmAhy88HKki6dngw3b67s5d8s9JQN9YusDkkYwdqpX6EdXSicGbM6jy<br />o364rLDwsq3jtQwFOvMu+55y5o+IZVBSmQfPPvnPejPZNyWJTfRiSZx+GvlOrUWB<br />rhwoYgufVUTwocH045thtz1MQ7tatTI2oJV+reR1oJOJ4sVXSmJotbZYcHbMhA2w<br />bQUVQJ/pKfIqYxFaZraIfoOtYp86sdZw7tshABEBAAG0FWRhbmtpIDxkYW5raUBn<br />bXgubmV0PokBOAQTAQIAIgUCUPxe3gIbAwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgEC<br />F4AACgkQZ6ku+ygZAjxdVAgAkQt8uriMdIK5sVQKLUTU/9+ml5crIbbMgIJeBqEa<br />/o51Jf+/J7hKXKmRN1+qMlySBnBRsoGg0nm1Cwmq1Nwy0KnuvYhRKPjTATnFqIJQ<br />XbdpTLEJMne88Si7VwlNJ8JxqOTCJT4hSm/bwLXV4kKziolp+r5bIpxlAiAE55Qa<br />k7qQR3+LLGd4YmE0da393BGfjxo23ONmryrGkuj9JZ5y14x3CojMpjPeN129rPub<br />Otd1IQHiHqQpOJoSnVjLRROxVW9JYAiXptkgiIIZayXk2xEZjKidEglGChd5ICGa<br />cAfJ1RWX8uFLF9TU0sosGvZLr7uzzDeB1wTvakNpe4DyPLkBDQRQ/F7eAQgAu7vi<br />0tceL0rzw80g9RrKSqFjUiDtFAFGpzrCrNYA39e6NmIDV2gi1tef25QCtCA0C7an<br />nTq0lb6Mt9roKRAO4+NmIf+5ituFMsG3bw4n3DXT4YBXyf1AE+fVpX07kJIFZa0q<br />Us+3WhcKN12gFuHbmpc4kbkuqnxEtdQ3sDfRUpEV8WkD0zxz2wnrHBT1d+NobhWc<br />NHAvp3RM54BGvUMaffdaj1371nwXu/jm8iIgUO9Gem+0Z6K5jQLD9ao1cZ7ic1j5<br />g5SF1WoKqWbL7ksIiRmZXHcE5878VLeIwRPksI8oDy7x1UEgs38O1LUlRcRdAIjv<br />0zkXQc8WydWjMeMaVQARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJQ/F7eAhsMAAoJEGepLvsoGQI8<br />CP4H/RnHZnhhL+JXCCIorcGtN9b7wS0BGpiJ22CJcMq73mSkyt3RbhSmRDx30MWP<br />0S7snKU4AZ639Hp76/oxjH9e8KTt4JDxL0JmXiYKqr+X7sRJhIP8xcVrRW9HCy4/<br />hVz/VP9mAxU5SsYSY8bhluFv9+GVCgo0KSr3MDXB1ZWnUFhnKwgoBi3hAKtmxXMV<br />btZT4HZIughpL5rBbKEbKUWn/9vRvfgxSQubKILTvOmPoUwRT+G7w0nsHzdC+X8F<br />5jlJc5KJ3I6x1q1l+xnCnzqRPU0sOUEnrANSBU9DyBLUJm4Psr03++U9hMTRxKTa<br />IUmf+9HVBj6EPXpLu4si6n9xmp0=<br />=4ZcL<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />
