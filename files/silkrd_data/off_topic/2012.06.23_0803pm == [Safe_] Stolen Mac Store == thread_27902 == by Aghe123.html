				No experience with the mac store but&nbsp; I know for a fact that stolen mac merchandise, as of last year, was easily registerable with no repurcusions following

				I saw it on the hidden wiki and thought it was to good to be true. Contacted the own of the site and asked if he would deal on silk road or black market reloaded and he didn&#039;t get back to me right away.<br /><br />Asked again and he said he&#039;d &quot;Look into it&quot;<br /><br />In other words if they don&#039;t deal within escrow it&#039;s likely a scam although I cannot prove it as I&#039;ve never ordered from them.<br /><br />-Zant

That goes double when: <br /><br />1) The goods are serialized; and<br /><br />2) The goods require updates (software) from the manufacturer. <br /><br />Depending on how these were acquired (i.e. from individuals or from say, a truckload shipment theft) the serial numbers of these machines are likely to be listed as stolen. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be in a hurry to purchase one. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good point Guru, thanks!<br /><br />I suppose the demand for stolen prices is driven by the huge prices for Macbooks.
