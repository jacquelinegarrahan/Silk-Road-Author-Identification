				Recently got 10 grams of pretty low purity molly, and I know you can clean it by mixing it with Acetone Anhydrous, but how much would I need of the AA to get the job done?

				It doesn&#039;t matter too much, I don&#039;t think. Washing is fairly inexact. Say, 20 mL per 100 mg on filter paper would be plenty, IMO. So that&#039;s 1 L per 1 gram, and you wouldn&#039;t even need that much.

This is called acetone wash, but you can do and recrystalisation with ispropyl alcohol.

				I posted a little tutorial about this somewhere on the forum, 5ml/ g is plenty. MDMA is almost insoluble in cold acetone so you can&#039;t add too much really. Be careful if you&#039;re recrystallising from IPA- it can take a long time for the crystals to come out of solution.

				wowzers, I found it :) (anyhow, you have posted there 20ml ether and 20ml acetone for 2g MDMA) so I think that what I have said 1g/5ml is fine for mdma wash and that is even less then what you have in your tutorial.<br />Standard for washing is 1:2 (1g/2ml) but with almost not soluble drugs that is not so important.<br />With IPA and recrystalisation you must know what you are doing and doing small tests for best result.<br /><br />wowzers tutorial<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=2362.msg19782#msg19782

				&quot;Chill 20 ml ether and 20 ml acetone.&quot; &quot;Add 10 ml chilled acetone, swirl and remove this liquid....Add 10 ml chilled ether, swirl and remove.&quot;&nbsp; So 5 ml/ g of each ;) just said to chill a bit more in case you need it. But whatever, the process wasn&#039;t based on any hard science, just me fucking around- you&#039;re right to say use the minimum amount possible.<br />Got some MD on the ways so I&#039;m finally going to get around to doing my photo tutorial I&#039;ve been promising for months!!

				Do you know any efficient method of removing sugars(sucrose,lactose) from MDMA or other drugs.<br />Sugars are not soluble (or has a low solubility) in alcohol or aceton. Maybe only AB extraction will work.

				Is IPA recrystallisation necessary? I&#039;m just trying to remove some of the junk

				Weird, I replied last night but the message didn&#039;t show up ???<br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever seen sucrose in some shitty street MDMA I bought once. Sucrose is insoluble in hot IPA so you can dissolve your MDMA in the minimum amount of hot IPA then pipette it off, leaving the sucrose behind.<br /><br />IllSpill- recrystallisation isn&#039;t necessary, a quick acetone wash will suffice but take a look at what you can get by doing one- <br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=66b0fe9f7624452625e903119c83c71b.jpg<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=a1040f6724a4d0ddaf919cd409af60ee.jpg

				Thanks, nice pictures&nbsp; :)<br />I did not meant particular for mdma but for other drugs what are cut with sucrose.<br />You should post tek with pictures.<br />Picture worth 1000 words.<br /><br />p.s.<br />I do have a lot of solvents ACS grade, ether, chloroform, IPA, acetone, DMSO etc, but I am too lazy to compose tutorial.

				Yeah the IPA trick applies to most drugs, IPA is syrupy and polar and dissolves most things but not lactose or sucrose. No experience with heroin or coke though so wouldn&#039;t like to recommend any clean ups for those. Tek will be up when my solvents arrive.
