Also they dont have organisations like the RIAA and MPAA trying to fuck you over. In fact they hosted thepiratebay.se :) I also strongly believe that Iran and Syria are the only countries who have leaders who dont want to fuck over their citizens. Yes, I said that about Syria yeah. Dont believe all the crap youre hearing on Fox, CNN and the BBC. I mean ask yourself, is the US helping rebels who are using bioweapons?

				This thread may have frayed beyond repair, but I too believe SR can be big, but I don&#039;t think big is in and of itself good. The more important thing to me is that SR can be a force for better future. If that&#039;s to be, I think four values need to be in place:<br /><br />1. Safety:&nbsp; If people start dying because of the misuse of SR substances, there will be an almighty effort to bring us down. Stay healthy. Safety also applies to keeping your packages stealthy, your house clean. If people start getting arrested, there will be deals made to give up others to save one&#039;s self. Prevention is key here.<br />2. Anonymity:&nbsp; Just learn how to maintain your anonymity! Encryption, PGP, delivery and pickup hygiene. Your anonymity may affect others. <br />3. Patience:&nbsp; Don&#039;t sacrifice the future for the present. Be patient about your funds, your orders, your space between drug use. Obviously this is connected to Safety &amp; Anonymity. <br />4. Solidarity:&nbsp; I realize that there is a healthy strain of anarchy on The Road, but I think that in the long run, helping others, behaving in an ethical manner, not turning on others will lead to a more resilient Road (and future) that everyone for herself.<br /><br />Huh. Maybe this is the &quot;life is beautiful&quot; thread after all.&nbsp; ;)
