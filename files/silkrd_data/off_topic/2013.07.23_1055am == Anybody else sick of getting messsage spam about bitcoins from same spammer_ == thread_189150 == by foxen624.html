				I just found and deleted for about the 10th time at least this week this same bit of spam from my forum PM inbox and as usual, was also addressed to a bunch of other people too.&nbsp; I saved the username this time, &quot;hj5e4h43g4&quot; but doubt it matters because even though I delete these right away and don&#039;t remember if the username is ever the same or not, I imagine it is always different because this one was not even registered, just sent msg as &quot;Guest&quot; and had 0 posts.&nbsp; But anyway, the message is always exactly (or at least appears to be) the same as the ones before:<br /><br />&quot;10 Bitcoin-$520 {w w w . e m o c o e . c o m} delivery in 2 minutes [1 bitcoin-$69]----&gt; [2 Bitcoin-$136]---&gt;{w w w . e m o c o e . c o m} [5 Bitcoin-$302]---&gt; [12 Bitcoin-$614]---&gt;{w w w . e m o c o e . c o m } [15 Bitcoin-$747] {w w w . e m o c o e . c o m } {w w w . e m o c o e . c o m }&quot;<br /><br />I remember having read somewhere a while back in one of the forums here where someone was complaining about spam in PMs and a reply (or replies) explaining how to block those people who send spam.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t pay much attention at the time though to the process described when I saw it because I guess it just hadn&#039;t been a problem yet for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, now I wish I&#039;d read it more thoroughly, as I&#039;ve spent quite a while looking through the forums, even doing a couple of searches trying to find that solution... but no luck and don&#039;t really want to devote much more time to a spammer who most likely changes their name every time and isn&#039;t even registered. Still, I wouldn&#039;t mind finding that forum thread again...<br /><br />Anyone else either know where I can find the topic I&#039;m referring to?&nbsp; Or know the answer..&nbsp; &nbsp;how to block, a spammer/person in forum PM&#039;s?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so,&nbsp; I&#039;d sure appreciate it...&nbsp; Thanks!

				well, just found another identical piece of spam, different username, &quot;gregh43y4&quot;.....&nbsp; but this one&#039;s registered with 60something posts..&nbsp; so, maybe blocking (at least some of) them might work after all....&nbsp; &nbsp;just figured I&#039;d mention....

				You can avoid this by going to your forum settings and making sure that &quot;show others when i&#039;m online&quot; is NOT selected.&nbsp; That should prevent most of these spam messages.

				Go to Profile, then Account Settings ... and it&#039;s in the section with your email address.&nbsp; It says &quot;Show others my online status&quot; -- make sure that box is NOT checked.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope this helps!
