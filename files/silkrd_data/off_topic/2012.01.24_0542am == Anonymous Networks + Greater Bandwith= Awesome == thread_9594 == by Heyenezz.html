				How much greater would bandwidth need to be for:<br /><br />--Encrypted anonymous VOIP?<br />--Encrypted anonymous file sharing that&#039;s at least fast enough for downloading a movie in an hour?<br />---Encrypted anonymous video hosting (think of YouTube but on Tor)<br />---Encrypted anonymous real-time video conferencing<br />---Encrypted anonymous real-time *HD* video streaming<br />---Etc.<br /><br />According to Nielsen&#039;s Law, a high-end user&#039;s bandwith increases 50% annually (hxxp://www.useit.com/alertbox/980405.html).<br /><br />Think of the possibilities! I think future generations are in for a real treat (imagine the RIAA&#039;s reaction to mass file sharing over the hidden web).

				i don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be any time soon. i&#039;m thinking 10+ years, if we&#039;re lucky.<br /><br />what you have to take into account is that while bandwidth is increasing, the quality of content is as well. torrent sites are carrying 50gb 3d-bluray rips now (well, the private ones i use are). So while bandwidth may be increasing exponentially it is doing so to meet the demand of a greater number of users downloading a substantially greater amount of data.

				I agree with sharetheroad, it might be a long while. But, I like the way you think. That kind of internet would be amazing! What would be more amazing is if we didn&#039;t need it.&nbsp; ::)

I know I would.

				Well, while bandwidth is most certainly limited, it seems like there would be a much bigger ping problem. Your traffic on Tor gets bounced around 3 or so random places in the world before it retrieves any info, then back through those 3 before it gets back to you.
