				Sex trafficking is the practice of moving women from one country to another frequently against their will. Do you mean to say you&#039;re wondering if you can buy sex slaves online?

				I would gladly own slaves if I could. Although, I wouldn&#039;t limit their uses to sophisticated masturbation (forced sex on a slave) I would have them clean my house and stuff too.

Nobody has expressed any interest in owning or attaining the life of another human being. This is purely for gathering information on the issue. Just because it isn&#039;t acknowledged on this forum, that takes nothing away from it&#039;s prevalence on the deep net. This is after all, an &quot;off topic&quot; forum :P

				People make tons of money on sex trafficking but it&#039;s not what you think. The ones making almost all the money are the ones claiming to fight it, not the ones engaging in the activity. They exaggerate the problem and appeal to the pussy emotions of pea-sized brained morons to give them money. You&#039;ve probably seen the bullshit numbers they throw out, like 1 in 5 women are sex trafficked and other bullshit that only a serious crack-addict could believe. In reality the problem is probably very small in scope and occurs mostly in countries no one gives a fuck about where most of the people are dying of starvation anyway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Find it on the internet?&nbsp; Don&#039;t be a dumb ass.

				I don&#039;t know much about sex trafficking, but does anyone know of the conditions people live (if you can call it that) like?<br />Like, are they in cages or basements, living in terrible conditions with STIs and mental disorders from the mistreatment.<br /><br />I remember watching a documentary here or there, with children traffickers on TV or or 2 times, and the people who escape, it doesn&#039;t seem to be overly hard. But maybe that&#039;s just because that particular case their guard wasn&#039;t as strong as others.<br /><br />I like most of the drug community here, seems to be a bunch of people who are knowledgeable on the drug use and drug saftey, who also respect human life and respect people&#039;s opinions/rights (well, not opinions). I understand that no one ( at least i hope) would actually want to deal with trafficking human lives, and that wont ever happen here on the silkroad.<br /><br />But anyone want to post any info? like a general summary of what sex trafficking is.<br />
