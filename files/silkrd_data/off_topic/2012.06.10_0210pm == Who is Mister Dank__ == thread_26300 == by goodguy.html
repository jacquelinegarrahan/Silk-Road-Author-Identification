				Now Children/Adults/Stoned students ........... it is time Mister Dank was judged in the interest of democracy i have given you 4 options, these should allow you to express how you really feel about good old Dank, to make this even more fair everybody gets 2 whole votes this is because it is very possible that Mister Dank is A sexually frustrated 40 year old man while still being An absolute wanker.<br /><br />happy voting don&#039;t you just love democracy in action<br /><br />Yours sincerely, GoodGuy

				Mister Dank is a disabled man-child with various disabilities and a brain similar in size to that of a small goat.<br /><br />I have set up a charity thread in the main sr discussion forum to help raise funds for him to deal with his various deformities and so hopefully one day he can become a real person and function in society.<br /><br />tl;dr: A Faggot

				Timmy always had a hard life, lately though he hasn&#039;t had enough money to buy his diabetes medication, which means instead of hearing his mum getting raped by his step dad he has troll internet forums while eating spoonfull&#039;s of sugar to keep him alive. You all should really go easier on timmy, having down syndrome has really messed up timmy&#039;s life... :/<br /><br />Locker.

				Only thing I would approve of on a bumper stick is &quot;Mister Dank is a Cwouche&quot; and for those that don&#039;t know a Cwouche is an amalgamation of the words Cunt, Wanker and Douche it&#039;s the perfect way to describe someone who surpasses the point where general arsehole doesn&#039;t cut it anymore.
