				That is one speech I didn&#039;t watch, but I will likely download as much of the convention as I can to make sure I see everything they had to say. I will also do the same with the DNC. The one speech I really liked was Paul Ryan&#039;s. He spoke with a comfortable tone, deliberately well paced, and undeniably incorrect facts (lies). I even heard republican analysts on PBS call his speech the most blatantly false moments of television that has been aired this year. The lies don&#039;t bother me, though, as all politicians lie. I was honestly and un-sarcastically&nbsp; moved by his speech. I do NOT agree with his views on many things (I disagree plenty with Obama as well) But I really do think that if Libertarian PAC&#039;s could afford a guy like Ryan to push their agenda, the election would be close between 3 parties (until the BS electoral vote came in) <br /><br />speaking of, I saw a website that was circulating a petition or group of petitions that called for public votes to abolish the electoral system, and move the process back to popular vote. I don&#039;t know too much about it, but if anyone does I would like the link again.<br /><br />enough politics for wretched today. I will be back next week with my views on the DNC though

				I think this is the most horrifically boring election I&#039;ve ever experienced. Its so stupefying it&#039;s fantastic. Last person awake gets to spend all the tax dollars. There&#039;s no real enthusiasm behind either candidate.<br /><br />If either candidate gets into office and actually has some good ideas implemented I&#039;d be seriously surprised. In fact I might go into shock.<br /><br />I bet the voter turnout in this election turns out to be at record lows.

I didn&#039;t vote in the last election, and I&#039;m not voting in this one. I won&#039;t spend my precious little free time worrying about a system that&#039;s long-since broken and is going to collapse in the next few decades anyway. It doesn&#039;t seem to me to matter what &quot;party&quot; you side with, they&#039;re all crooks just wearing different masks.

				Dude, because Clint is THE MAN, I&#039;m pretty sure he just felt like the Republican party lately is not HIS republican party and he just had the chance to sabotage a lil bit and went with it.<br />Just my take on that ridiculousness.<br />The man cried once in front of his children, over a dead parrot, i mean, seriously

				I watched a re-run of Jimmy Carters back in 1976 the other night and It was great. I am working on getting my voter&#039;s rights back but until then I love arguing with people on YouTube and trying to influence people&#039;s votes. It drives me crazy I can&#039;t vote even if it don&#039;t mean shit. I still love watching people get amped up over that non-since and love to put in my 2 cents with people I agree with and against those I disagree with. It&#039;s a great victory for me if I can influence somebody to change their vote
