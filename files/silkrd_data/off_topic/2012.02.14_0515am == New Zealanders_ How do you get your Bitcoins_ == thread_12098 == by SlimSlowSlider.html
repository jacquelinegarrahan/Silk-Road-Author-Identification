				I am having a lot of trouble finding a viable way to exchange my money for bitcoins...&nbsp; I know about bitnz but that site seems impossible to buy a significant amount from, plus the price seems to fluctuate widely, even for what you&#039;d expect from bitcoins. Is everybody (who didn&#039;t mine them) in NZ just using the Mt Gox type sites and sucking it up when faced with the wire fees? I hope somebody can let me in on some insider method for getting a few hundred dollars of bitcoins in one go... Thank you for any advice.

				Bitnz isnt that bad for amounts under 10btc.<br />For larger amount, webmoney.co.nz accepts bank deposits in exchange for LibertyExchange. Liberty &gt; BitInstant &gt; MtGox &gt; SilkRoad.<br /><br />Best methods that I have found.<br />

				I see this thread is a bit old, but...<br /><br />I have been having trouble getting ukash vouchers. Many places that are supposed to sell them, at least according to the ukash nz website, have never heard of them. A few random dairies that have epay terminals couldn&#039;t give me them. WTF is going on? How can it be so hard to get ukash in nz?<br /><br />Any insights welcome...

				New Zealanders, how much would it cost with fees, to exchange say $100NZD for BTC? And how long would it take you?

				Hi Paddy,<br /><br />I operate a service selling Bitcoins to people for cash in the mail for UK/EU users.<br /><br />Although it hadn&#039;t even crossed my mind last week a client got in touch and asked if I would be willing to process an order from NZ. I looked into this and asked on the forums and found that it&#039;s actually quite easy to ship from NZ to the Uk (about 4 working days) and it&#039;s possible to insure your money through an International Express option too.<br /><br />I am not saying that you have to use my service by any means (although you&#039;re most welcome to!) but it seems to me using BitNZ wouldn&#039;t be very safe as I understand you have to show ID to wire them money. Of course if the original purchase of Bitcoins can be traced to your original wallet address this reduces your safety so even if you don&#039;t want to use my service I&#039;d suggest buying your BTC with cash.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br />

				Hey Vlad, <br /><br />Thanks for your offer, but i&#039;m in Australia! <br /><br />I agree too, it&#039;s a pain in the ass to have to show ID to them. I was thinking that I may be able to offer some assistance to our NZ friends re: BTC via Australia.<br /><br />Definitely not trying to steal anyone&#039;s business, i&#039;ll leave that to the masters, such as yourself ;)<br /><br />Cheers Mate

Shipping takes around five days to UK, I imagine it&#039;s faster there between NZ and Oz - what&#039;s the exchange rate like between the NZD and AUD, is it fairly stable?<br /><br />V.

				Usually around AUD-NZD $1.27. Usually pretty stable. Just thought I could help some fellow Roaders get some coins easily and anonymously!

				Recently I&#039;ve had a lot of trouble getting BTC, i used to use Bitnz but now you have to have proof of address and show them ID so there&#039;s no way I&#039;m doing that, i would use ukash but it seems dodgy buying 500+ worth of vouchers when ukash isnt even popular in NZ and there is a lack of ukash to BTC vendors right now. I would try Western union but vendors ask for a security question and answer and there is&nbsp; not option for that on their site. I&#039;m thinking of trying spendbitcoins.com using WU. What methods are you guys using at the moment?
