				For our little &quot;project&quot; I&#039;ve had a look at pages from a lot of vendors on SR (cocaine vendors in Europe) and then I had to find a system to give the vendors a score&nbsp; for their page. For this purpose I made this little note. <br />Read all about the &quot;little project&quot;: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91822.0;topicseen<br /><br />Now I would like to know what&#039;s your opinion on the list... <br /><br /><br />Most of the pages are quite similar and quite good, but some really lack important information or have a lot of totally useless paragraphs. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know if the vendors already have a forum where they&#039;re asking/discussing what should be on a vendors page and what shouldn&#039;t be, but in order to be able to give a score to the vendors page I made a little list of what I think should and should not be on their page. <br />Off course: the page should be polite and friendly with clear and structured text. <br /><br />Really: the best is to keep it short and simple, just make sure all the info is there, but nothing more and write it in a friendly and polite style. <br /><br />What should be on their page: <br />a greeting <br />a link to the vendors forumpage!<br />what the vendor sells, what he doesn&#039;t sell<br />in what quantities he sells his products<br />privnote accepted or not<br />PGP/GPG only or not<br />shipping from which country<br />shipping to which countries <br />not shipping to which countries<br />special conditions for certain countries<br />shipping frequency: every hour/day/week/...<br />shipping cost: per country/region/...<br />tracking possible or not <br />refund &amp; return policies<br />BTC only<br />FE requested/appreciated/unnecessary<br />policies towards new SR visitors/first time buyers<br />tormail address (or other) in case SR is down <br />public key <br /><br /><br />What&#039;s a bonus on a vendors page: <br />an informative link to the forumpage about PGP and how to use it<br />estimated shipping times <br />working during the weekends or not<br />details on package (how many times vacuum sealed, envelope, ...)<br />discount possibilities<br />special deals for regular customers <br />“order a sample first if you&#039;re not shure you&#039;re gone like it”!<br /><br /><br />What should NOT be on a vendors page: <br />feedback from “customers”<br />personal introduction <br />quotes from books, movies, comics, cartoons, ... <br />“I only sell the best” <br />only SR deals<br /><br /><br />I understand some vendors might have a lot of messages to reply to. I also understand that some vendors have had bad experiences in the past (and will probably have some in the future also), but I genuinely believe that in a good and professional business “the customer is king”. But some pages are written in such a style that it seems like the customer is nothing more than a necessary pain... <br /><br /><br />Again, read all about our &quot;little project&quot;: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91822.0;topicseen<br /><br />and lett me know what you think about my little list regarding the do&amp;don&#039;t for vendors pages!<br />Cheers, R5

				I think that vendors need to have the BTC ONLY on their page, we get deluged with requests to pay using alternatives otherwise :)

				I would like to add a request that on the Vendor page, (I suppose we should be saying &quot;Profile&quot; page) when a vendor writes &quot;Update&quot; that they remember to &quot;Put the date!!&quot; Many do, but quite a few don&#039;t , so unless you follow them all the time, you have no idea if that&#039;s old news or not. Also &quot;Clean up&quot; old stuff, unless leaving it on shows where you&#039;ve been, and how you&#039;ve progressed, which is understandable. <br /><br />Also the &quot;FE&quot;&nbsp; request, should be backed up with some sense of reason. - Been burned by buyers before, etc. <br /><br />I&#039;ll never understand, why some vendors want FE, even from someone with over 25 buys, 0 auto-finalizes, and 0 refunds. (that&#039;s me)<br /><br />It&#039;s kind of an insult to a buyer, who has played by the rules, and maybe even eaten a few lost orders,&nbsp; just to keep the 0 refunds rating there. <br /><br />Well that&#039;s my addition to the &quot;Perfect Vendor Profile Page&quot; request list. <br /><br />Great topic! <br />+1 Karma for you RaFaeL5 ! :) <br /><br />PS.&nbsp; I found it surprising too, that people don&#039;t catch on to the &quot;BTC Only&quot; rule. - It could be because the FE rule is ignored constantly too. Both are seemingly &quot;frowned upon&quot;, but FE listings are allowed. -alternatives to BTC aren&#039;t.

				also: when vendors keep a &quot;diary&quot; on their pages, <br />they should keep it updated - so only mark the present situation, don&#039;t make it a list of what you had/did/didn&#039;t have/didn&#039;t do for the last month. Keep it short!
