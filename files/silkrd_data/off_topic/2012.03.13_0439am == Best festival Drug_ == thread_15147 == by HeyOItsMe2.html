				You just need to space out your drugs and drink enough water.<br /><br />Day 1 of EDC: dropping some hits of LSD<br /><br />Day 2 of EDC: dropping some 2c-b<br /><br />Day 3 of EDC: dropping some rolls white speakers.

				I got sold DOx (as acid) at Schwagstock one year, me and my brother ran around the woods all night meeting people, it was great. <br /><br />Usually though, I like to smoke pot and hash pretty much the entire time. <br /><br />At night it really depends how i feel and what bands are playing. I usually end up eating some MDMA/MDA, maybe with a little bit of mushrooms or 2c-b with it. <br />Another night I might drop acid and possibly smoke a joint with DMT if Shpongle is playing...<br /><br />Somewhere in there i might throw in a little booze, maybe a dash of ketamine if they have a river.

				If you pace yourself and know yourself you can do drugs every day.&nbsp; I like day tripping at fests then rolling at night- i havent done 2cb at a fest yet, but its been great at clubs so Im assuming it would be awesome at a fest. so would 25i.&nbsp; Just pace yourself stay hydrated and listen to your body, fests are an awesome display of hedonism, but dont ruin the experience and if you need help- get it, dont hesitate on some stupid shit.&nbsp; and always keep plenty of bud on you- it eases the stomach (a lot of drugs will fuck your shit up and the porta potties at fests as you man know are grimey) and it makes all other drugs better
