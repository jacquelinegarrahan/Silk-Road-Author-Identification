				Yes, but it was only after taking LSD for a while that I started having trips that were better than anything I&#039;d experienced on MDMA.

				For me first time MDMA was better than first time LSD in terms of how I felt. But they&#039;re far different feelings, so whilst I enjoy the feeling of having my ass kicked by a 1000ug+ LSD trip and all the insights (good and bad) I get from that, a lot of people wouldn&#039;t find that &#039;pleasant&#039;.<br /><br />Ultimately though, unless you&#039;re really worried and going to worry yourself into a bad trip there isn&#039;t much risk, so try and and see for yourself? With something like LSD the experience is often very unique to the individual so I think that&#039;s the best way to understand it.

				I just saw this clip last night and it made me feel a lot better about LSD (also had a bad experience with shrooms recently). <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7fOuPTZtWI
