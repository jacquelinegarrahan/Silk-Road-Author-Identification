				I vote for complete legalization with regulation on the sales. But NOT exactly government regulation. More of government licensing based on regulations set by the &quot;public drug retail board&quot; which would be an organization paid for by business men and women engaged in the retail of recreational drugs. The licensing requirements would be based on product testing and labeling requirements, harm reduction and addiction counseling. It would be illegal to sell drugs without this license, and the penalties for doing so should be as harsh or more so than current drug policy. I think there should be an age limit on possession also, but not because I think that people under let&#039;s say 18 shouldn&#039;t be able to use drugs, but because I think the children should be able to argue that &quot;it&#039;s legal&quot; to parents who do not want their children participating in drug use.

				I would like to see another option in between #1 and #2: Require proof of age but not ID (I do not want the retailer selling the info to my health insurance company.)

				it shouldn&#039;t be anyone&#039;s business to tell another person how they <br />have to live. I think any politician introducing any law that limits another<br />citizens right to live free should be put to death by hanging in the public square.<br />who the fuck are they to tell anyone how to live when the fuck up everything<br />they touch!<br /><br />if u do however choose to use drugs u should be held responsible if u hurt any<br />other citizen while enjoying ur drug of choice.<br /><br />tit for tat!
