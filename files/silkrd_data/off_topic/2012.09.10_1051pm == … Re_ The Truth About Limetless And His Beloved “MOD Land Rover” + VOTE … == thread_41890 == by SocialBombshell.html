				The Original - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39482.0 <br /><br />Hi All :)<br /><br />Just returned from a wonderful long weekend away! To find my controversial post regarding Limetless and his X MOD Land Rover, to be locked by, surprise, surprise, SR&#039;s #1 Gangsta Limetless himself.<br /><br />I have read it once, twice, three times. He hasn&#039;t actually answered why he copied it, and what would the purchaser receive for his highly inflated price. <br /><br />It&#039;s certainly not that particular one of a kind X Mod Land Rover, that&#039;s for sure! <br /><br />And that thread has been one of the most popular on SR of all time, nearly 4000 hits, I rightly remember, and went on for 29 pages, people wanted to know! And people still want to know! :)<br /><br />He responded on page 25, hasn&#039;t actually admitted what he&#039;s done, and tried to fob everyone off with free meow meow samples, funny shit, but unfortunately the questions have been unanswered! Looks like a cover up if you ask me!...<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39482.msg452658#msg452658 <br /><br />My question is why advertise something (whatever it is) if your not it&#039;s rightful owner, or know anything about it&#039;s damn, specs that you wish to copy it from a clearweb site, it&#039;s beyond a joke! Especially from a vendor/moderator held with such “high esteem” here. It&#039;s a big let down!<br /><br />Ah, and it was to be expected that “once again” the WHORE card was played, don&#039;t you boys ever get bored of that? Obviously not. In case you didn&#039;t realise, it really shows your maturity! Especially Limetless, he loves talking about it! It makes him feel BIG, powerful, and in control! I&#039;m afraid your not! Especially when it concerns me and whatever concerns me. Deal with it and get over it! And if you can&#039;t right now, I hope it works out for you eventually, I have faith!<br /><br />Oh, and TorChat? Wonderful wasn&#039;t it, those 12 hour all night sessions, couldn&#039;t get enough could you? :)<br /><br />If your going to knock my “personal lifestyle”... <br /><br />What&#039;s worse? <br /><br />Myself. Honest, and never had to copy and paste, in her life, very knowledgeable upon her business decisions, been respected and recommended many times over for that!. Completely in control of her business and life choices in every respect. Who, where, what, and why, I&#039;m in total control. I do something because I want to, it&#039;s my choice, I answer to nobody but myself! Get that straight! Like it or lump it, I don&#039;t care, because I know what I&#039;m all about, and that&#039;s good enough for me! Every negative word uttered about me on here, from those that are either jealous or are too immature to understand, nothing can actually be proved, and I laugh, a lot, it&#039;s hilarious! Think whatever you like, but you know absolutely nothing! :)<br /><br />Or Limetless? A self proclaimed “drug dealer”, pedalling “research chemicals”, that have no research/knowledge of their “long term side effects”? Remember marijuana has been used for thousands of years, cocaine for hundreds, but this is a new and dangerous area to deal in...<br /><br />The Unknown!<br /><br />And fuck knows what the long time side effects could be? It&#039;s a lottery! And if you like to gamble, then go for it! But providing he&#039;s getting where he wants to be in life, that&#039;s good enough for him, he doesn&#039;t give a fuck. And copying and pasting from the fucking clearweb, yeah, that&#039;s awesomely knowledgeable, well done indeed! I certainly don&#039;t need security advice from the clearweb, that&#039;s sticking ones hand in the fire!<br /><br />Seeing the side-effects of meow meow on here, with it&#039;s users that practically worship the ground he walks on as their demi god, it makes you completely retarded, and all your common sense gets thrown out the window in the process! For hells sake, Limetless, could rob from the Dali Lama, and they&#039;d still be in love with him! See what I mean? But would I expect any less from a bunch of 21 year olds, hiding out in the parents basements, messing around with shit they don&#039;t understand, nope, not at all :) And providing there&#039;s plenty of them to go around, there will be plenty of business coming his way! It&#039;s all good! :)<br /><br />I guess, the past four paragraphs, got a bit personal, but it&#039;s just my opinion, feel free to take it with a pinch of salt! :)<br /><br />Oh, and Lim, go and get help before it&#039;s too late, sniffing 5g&#039;s a night of that shit is going to be the ruination of you, if you want to make it to 25, it&#039;s time to STOP getting high of your own supply! That&#039;s what the real “drug dealers” do! Take this advise from someone much more experienced then you in life. Weren’t you ever told to respect your elders? :) <br /><br />And I know you hate me for that, but hell, what can I do about it? Can&#039;t help that life has blessed me in ways, you don&#039;t understand, yet! ;)<br /><br />And say hi to V from me! Hope he&#039;s okay? I know he&#039;s pissed off a lot of people, and I&#039;m very angry about it, but to be fair I did find him a lovely person to communicate with personally, and I&#039;m a little sad that he&#039;s not around any more, but what can you do? Shit happens.<br /><br />Why did all those messages connecting the two of you together get deleted?<br /><br />I remember when you posted here for small transactions go to V and for larger transactions come to me (you). <br /><br />Unfortunately, those messages have been deleted, what&#039;s there to hide? Care to explain? Lots of people are owed money here, and have the right to know! It would be nice of you to grow up, and stop acting dumb, over the whole situation! Because there&#039;s some of us that remember! Just accept that and be honest :)<br /><br />And thank-you for the great amount of entertainment you have provided, like you shared it with your mates, I shared it with mine too, takes one to know one, we&#039;ve been pissing ourselves with laughter!<br /><br />Now it&#039;s time to man up and explain, that&#039;s if your man enough! But somehow I doubt you are, feel free, to prove me wrong! ;)<br /><br />P.S. I appreciate this post is a little bit harsh and rough around the edges in areas, but I&#039;ve had enough of the personal pointless attacks, which were completely irreverent to the questions concerned. Copying and pasting really pisses me off in a BIG WAY, especially when it concerns the sale of goods, I fucking hate it! It&#039;s so damn wrong! :(
