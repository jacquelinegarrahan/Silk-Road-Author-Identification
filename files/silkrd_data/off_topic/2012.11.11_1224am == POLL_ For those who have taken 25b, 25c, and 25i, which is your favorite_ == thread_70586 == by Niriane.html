				B has a lighter body/mind load, faster come-up, colorful visuals, sensory enhancement, and a whole bunch of other stuff you can read here (summary of this and other nbomes): <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36654.msg423921#msg423921

				i have not tried the B&#039;s but noth I and C i have done plenty of. the first timei droped a tab of 25c i didnt find it to impressiver at all, it was tabs from hardhustle 600ug complexed. some 25i from misc vendors some complexed and some not, i find that i onnly felt anything with the complxed blotters. aside from one night droping multiple tabs of 25i not complxed , had to be at least three full tabs..now i always smoke lots of fatty blunts when on any phycadelic drug for it seems to make me trip my face to the floor, launches me into straight ego death, almost evrytime reguardless of dose. the second time i droped the 25c from hustle hard, i had givin one to a buddy the same time i did the ifrst one and he said it was awesome, so this time we droped 1/1/2 each, and boy i tell you i was def triping balls, only it didnt seem to have much of a head fuck as the 25i&#039;s..then again i dont rememer smoking much pot that night. the c&#039;s has me seeing the most incredible colors for hours, very good feeling, got the giggles as always when on a good trip, only thing i have to say on not such a postitive note about and of the RCs is that they all seem to have a body load, i seemt o get lots of vasoconstriction, like pins and needles numbing sensation, usualy just in my hands.. tho my friend claimed it was able to &quot; feel the shit in his bones&quot; lmao .we that meant. i assume its just the reg body load that you get when the waves are rushing in thru your blood lol. hope my exp helped some. good luck! stay safe!

				Having only tried 25i, I accidentally voted for 25b but actually would have voted for 25c based on my partner&#039;s feedback. He said C is the most cozy and general feel-good. He didn&#039;t try 25d though.

				I&#039;ve tried all three. I voted for the 25b. I have only done it one time so I would like to do more research with it. 25c has always been my favorite til I tried the B. I&#039;ve done a shit load of the C. I find myself gravitating toward vendors who offer 25c. If a vendor had all the nbomes then I would usually buy the 25c until i got to try the B finally and now I want more.
