				I am a single dad, I have a 3 year old son, he lives with me and my girlfriend (not his mom). I used to split custody with his mom, until she was arrested for child abuse 2 years ago (she was beating him, leaving welts on his back with a belt, when he was only 1 year old) and lost custody. She got convicted of 3rd degree child abuse. She&#039;s a crazy, abusive, junkie bitch and can&#039;t take care of herself, let alone a child. She can have 2 visits a week with him, supervised by a social worker, but she blows most of them off, only seeing him about once a month, sometimes not for a couple months.<br /><br />Anyway I was talking to a coworker today about my kids junkie mom, and he said something along the line of, &quot;any one who has kids and does drugs is a bad parent&quot;. I disagree with that, while there are plenty of people who are bad parents on drugs and drug addiction can make you a bad parent when you are neglecting or abusing you&#039;re kids because of the drug, or just getting wasted all the time instead of spending some time with you&#039;re kids. (like my dad, he put a roof over my head and food on the table and never abused me but he didn&#039;t put any effort into being a parent, all he would do was drink, never spend time with me or took me anywhere, never showed much interest in me)<br /><br />But I think you can use drugs responsibly and still be a good parent.<br /><br />I uses drugs and I consider myself a good responsible parent, I take care of my son and spend time with him. As long as you are not an addict, don&#039;t use in front of you&#039;re kids, and as long as you&#039;re drug use is not effecting you&#039;re ability to care for you&#039;re child&#039;s needs, spend time with them and be there for them, I think you can be a good parent and use drugs. As long as you don&#039;t let the drugs become the priority over you&#039;re child and you&#039;re passing out\getting wasted and not watching you&#039;re kids.<br /><br />Anyway, what do you guys think? Anyone here have kids and use drugs? Do you think it effect you&#039;re abilities as a parent in a negative way?<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t think using drugs makes you a bad parent. In fact, I think marijuana makes some people BETTER parents. It&#039;s possible to be a responsible parent and a responsible drug user alllll at the same time :)

				Don&#039;t have kids but if I had i would never let them see me using drugs and I do use hard drugs recreationally - injecting heroin, injecting cocaine, injecting meth. But I heard somewhere that if you&#039;re addicted or use lets say opiates your kid might be more prone to opiate addiction.

				I&#039;ve been having a similar debate with myself recently.<br /><br />I agree with the OP that it&#039;s possible to use drugs and be a good parent.<br /><br />However, another thing to think about is the inherently risky situation we are putting kids in by simply choosing to have drugs,<br /><br />unfortunately it is criminal activity in many cases in our current world,<br /><br />morally it may not be our fault that drug use has been criminalized,<br /><br />but is it not ethically our duty to keep our kids safe from the possibility of having their parent incarcerated for drug use?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an easy answer, just trying to add to the discussion -<br /><br />I know I sure as hell will have to continue a certain level of drug use to cope with parenthood, <br />just as with all aspects of life with which drugs help cope<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />just my 2 bitcents

				I do feel that a parent can be a responsible drug user.<br /><br />A main counter to this, which I do feel is very relevant, is the question of whether or not you can be there for your kids in an emergency.<br /><br />Example: Your kid: chokes on something/gets cut/breaks a bone/has an allergic reaction/etc. If you&#039;re high on a certain drug, can you dependably respond to the situation and make prudent decisions? Or, is there a sober trusted person who can respond to the situation in a timely manner? If not, you may want to reconsider your use.

				WWW- you sound like a responsible parent to me :) Parents need an outlet every so often and if you&#039;re only indulging once every few months then you&#039;re using less frequently than many of my friends (who happen to be business professionals) whom I consider to be responsible parents.

				I have my first child due in a little over four weeks.&nbsp; As I have mentioned in some other friends, I have been on somewhat of a personal binge - for me at least.&nbsp; This is due to my trying to experience everything I can one last time before having to become a responsible parent.<br /><br />That being said, I certainly think people can be both responsible drug users and parents.&nbsp; When my child is very little my wife and I have talked about how we could still trip and roll (as long as we have breast milk in reserve) since we are of sound mind enough to deal with situations if they were to happen on those substances.<br /><br />As our child grows older this obviously becomes a bit harder.&nbsp; I would not want a young impressionable kid to witness his or her dad on K.&nbsp; That would be pretty freaky.&nbsp; So as the child starts growing older I would like to hide those situations as much as possible.&nbsp; But I would also like to be able to have honest conversations about drugs and help them understand them in a way different than the schools teach.<br /><br />I do agree that going to jail and not taking care of them would be a travesty.&nbsp; But as long as I am using the drugs responsibly there is almost no chance of that happening after acqusition.&nbsp; And this is he reason I have been buying up everything on SR like a fiend these past few months - to build the most complete, immaculate, perfect collection of drugs ever so I dont have to worry about that part anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, these next few months should be a real fuckin trip!

She shouldn&#039;t be making you feel like shit for being extra loving and playing with toys w/ your child. If you were tripping balls that would different.
