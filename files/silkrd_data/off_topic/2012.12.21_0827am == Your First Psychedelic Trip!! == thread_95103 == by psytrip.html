				Share your first psychedelic experience in this thread. I know the first psychedelic is a good trip or a bad trip..but every one has a bad trip, share it. I was lucky to have a very good trip in my first psychedelic trip and the substance was lsd. It was a 350 micro of a good blotter paper, that was shared by me and one of my good friend (I call him Jim Morrison), and probably he was responsible for making my trip a very good trip. We had good hand rubbed Indian hashish with us to smoke while tripping, so we were prepared. We bought some cigarette pacakets, a juice bottle, some eatables, and were ready to go. <br /><br />We sat in our room closed with a psycho painting hanged in front of&nbsp; the wall, connected the ipod with the speakers, and we both started chewing the blotter and started making a joint. The music was on (The Doors), and Jim Morrison was by my side&nbsp; :) :).. We ingested at about 9 pm and it started in 15 minutes. The vibe, whole body, every tissue was dancing with music. We smoked the joint. There were good closed eye visuals, which we both were enjoying together throughout the trip and out of body experience was there, and believe me the eyes closed, we both were dancing together sometime on the mountains, sometimes on the beach. The walls melted sometimes, and sometimes, everything was infinite. At around 12 pm our ciggerete, our juice were finished. And damn, we were thirsty. Though there was a shop just below our room, but it was like traveling from the Moon to Earth. We both went out of the room, went to the shop and bought all the required stuff. Everyone down there were amazed to see the way we were talking and the way we were behaving. We grabbed our stuff, and immediately went to our room, and all of a sudden (because the music was on), we both were on the top (flying high again). We rolled a joint, and rolled again and enjoyed a lot. The night passed by. At around 5 in the morning, we slept and it was the best sleep of my life. I got up at around 4 pm, and my mind was crystal clear, I was crystal clear in fact (loved the feeling). And couldn&#039;t wait for my next trip.<br /><br />And a lot of trips after that, some good, some bad, some worst&nbsp; :-\. But the first trip is always a first trip.<br /><br />Turn on, Tune in and Drop out!!

				You view and don&#039;t share. That&#039;s not fair. Share your experience and it feels good when others read and remember their first trip.

				I&#039;ve only done one psychedelic and it was 25i, so it wasn&#039;t really that mind-blowing an experience, but I did enjoy it a lot. Basically I was at a friends apartment and I had been doing a lot of methylone and I had 25i tabs that I hadn&#039;t done yet and I was trying to calm down my drug use so I vowed that that night would be the last time I did any of the batch we had got. So I take one of the tabs, go outside and manage to come up right as the sun is coming down, it was beautiful. Notice just a slight bit of mindfuck, but not too bad. After that, I start getting nauseous, so I go to vomit, and I just remember staring at my vomit for the longest time because it was pretty in a morbid sorta way; it looked like little micro-organisms swallowing each other up and then splitting and changing color. Immediately when I stood up, I noticed that the world had gotten a bit more wavy. I stare at myself in the mirror for a while as I wash my hands and brush my teeth, and remark at how beautiful I thought I looked, because everything just had a wonderful oil-painting look which washed all my blemishes away. This made me feel really happy and I immediately start laughing uncontrollably, which continues as I exit the room. For the next couple hours or so I literally *can&#039;t* stop laughing. It was wonderful. My friends leave the apartment to go to the store or something so I&#039;m left alone, and I did a little inward thinking about some issues in my life and some stuff I was coming to terms with, and genuinely felt that the 25i helped me mentally conquer some of the things I had been putting off for a long time.<br /><br />Then I go to check my blood sugar and realize that I don&#039;t have any strips for my meter, so I have to spend ALL my money on them ( testing strips are sold in boxes of 50 and 100, and they&#039;re roughly 1.5 USD per strip ) so me and my friend start talking in line about how we&#039;re going to go down to the hardware section and break open the box ( they had it in the little plastic things that stop you from stealing them ) and laughing about everything. So me and my friend are bullshitting and this lady in front of us looks increasingly more and more fed up, but that just adds to the fun of it. <br /><br />So we buy the shit, I check my sugar, and it&#039;s high as fuck. I didn&#039;t realize that the complexed blotters apparently increase my blood sugar, plus since the bodyload of the 25i was so different, i couldn&#039;t tell that my sugar was high but I didn&#039;t want it to get low throughout the trip so I had been eating and drinking sugary shit all night to stop myself from falling into a coma from low blood sugar. But I take my insulin and everything gets hunky dory again.<br /><br />We get back to the apartment and me and a friend talk drug pharmacology which I enjoy discussing immensely, and I have a good time just shooting the breeze with &#039;im. At about t+8 or so I feel a bit tired, but still sorta odd, so I check my sugar again and it&#039;s fine so I go to bed without the aid of any benzos or anything. Very nice closed eye visuals, nothing too pushy, but I could visualize many nice things in my head as I was falling asleep.

I loved the way you watched your vomit for a long time and it was beautiful ;D ;D And when you went to buy the strips..lol...I hope will try 25i some time, and see how does it feel.. :) :)Wish your blood sugar is always normal and you get a long long life to try more 25i ;)..

				my first trip was with lsa in the form of hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. i took a nap right after eating them and woke up tripping. stayed in bed for hours, going in and out of consciousness. at one point i seemed to zoom in on my own bodily processes. it was as if i was floating down my own bloodstream, if that makes any sense. after hours of just lying in bed basking in the beauty of it all, i spent the remainder of the trip with my mother, discussing the wonders of life and connecting on a deeper level. she was a very spiritual person who did a lot of lsd in her time. i couldn&#039;t have asked for a better sitter. it really was the perfect introduction to the psychedelic experience for me...

				I guess it depends on what exactly you mean by first. My first breakthrough trip was this summer smoking salvia. I entered a completely different reality and something was trying to climb out of my mouth that I kept opening and closing (no idea if I was doing that in reality but in the salvia reality I was). After I came back to reality I was extremely euphoric for the rest of the come down and felt pretty happy for the rest of the day.<br /><br />If you just mean first time using a psychedelic period I guess that would be smoking weed in highschool though I&#039;ve never had any visuals with weed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95103.msg675824#msg675824">Quote from: moonflower on December 22, 2012, 02:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">my first trip was with lsa in the form of hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. i took a nap right after eating them and woke up tripping. stayed in bed for hours, going in and out of consciousness. at one point i seemed to zoom in on my own bodily processes. it was as if i was floating down my own bloodstream, if that makes any sense. after hours of just lying in bed basking in the beauty of it all, i spent the remainder of the trip with my mother, discussing the wonders of life and connecting on a deeper level. she was a very spiritual person who did a lot of lsd in her time. i couldn&#039;t have asked for a better sitter. it really was the perfect introduction to the psychedelic experience for me...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hah, I got some HBWR seeds recently.

I remember the body load the most, the first time I did it I felt very sick during the come up and was kind of regretting taking it and even feeling like maybe something bad would happen to me. It is kind of strange because I never got that feeling so intensely from 2c-t-2 again. The pain and sickness faded away into Euphoria. I felt extremely talkative but also mildly dissociated. Honestly it is kind of hard to remember specifics of that trip it was quite a while ago and I have tripped probably a thousand times since then on various psychedelics. I remember that the walls looked like they were melting and everything felt nice and looked nice and I had a very enjoyable time after the initial pain and sickness passed. I remember my first LSD and 2c-i trips the best. Hell I even remember the first time that I smoked weed better.

				Pretty sure I had my first ever &#039;bad trip&#039; yesterday I&#039;d like to share with you guys.. Snorted way to much 2c-b and Ketamine after a huge dose of mdma and things got very intense. What made it worse is the set and setting were very bad and one of my mates started tripping very hard.. like running into walls and screaming at them. That is the last time I get my mate to measure out the doses for us...<br />But I didnt exactly panic or lose my mind completely but the visuals and body load were extremely intense, I also kept forgetting where I was which wasn&#039;t nice, especially as I was unfamiliar with the setting as well. <br />Feeling a bit faded today but popped some Xanax and gunna have a sleep.

				My first psychedelic experience was on Salvia divinorum. I smoked about .05-.1g of 10x extract (can&#039;t remember), held the smoke for 20 seconds and laid down on my bed. Gravity started getting stronger and I began melting into the bed a little bit. I looked around my room until my backpack caught my eye. It seemed like it was a living being and it was communicating with me telepathically. Then the effects subsided.

				First time I tripped I ate two fresh mushrooms right off the cow shit about half the size of my arm. I had no idea what I was getting myself into as I was just a young lad. <br /><br />I sat under a tree and felt a vibration that seemed to start from one end of my head and yooo000mm around as if it were a circular ring inside my skull.. I was fascinated and began to close my eyes and got to a point where I could no longer tell if my eyes were open or not ( it was dark). I sat down and began to feel my spirit detach from my body and shoot into the stars. I felt as if I had traveled around the earth from afar. It was amazing to say the least. Since then, I have given up alcohol and cigarettes.. crap shit IMO and nw love the road for what it provides me with.. good trips, good vibes and the best tree EVER.

My first breakthrough trip was this summer smoking salvia. I entered a completely different reality and something was trying to climb out of my mouth that I kept opening and closing (no idea if I was doing that in reality but in the salvia reality I was). After I came back to reality I was extremely euphoric for the rest of the come down and felt pretty happy for the rest of the day.<br /><br />If you just mean first time using a psychedelic period I guess that would be smoking weed in highschool though I&#039;ve never had any visuals with weed.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95103.msg675824#msg675824">Quote from: moonflower on December 22, 2012, 02:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">my first trip was with lsa in the form of hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. i took a nap right after eating them and woke up tripping. stayed in bed for hours, going in and out of consciousness. at one point i seemed to zoom in on my own bodily processes. it was as if i was floating down my own bloodstream, if that makes any sense. after hours of just lying in bed basking in the beauty of it all, i spent the remainder of the trip with my mother, discussing the wonders of life and connecting on a deeper level. she was a very spiritual person who did a lot of lsd in her time. i couldn&#039;t have asked for a better sitter. it really was the perfect introduction to the psychedelic experience for me...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hah, I got some HBWR seeds recently. I had done morning glories in highschool and just got a really strong high similar to weed edibles. I wanted to try it again but stronger so I got the HBWR instead. I forget how many I took. I think 6. I didn&#039;t trip, it just fucked me up for awhile. LSA besides being a hallucinogen is also a fairly strong sedative. At the peak it was very hard to move my arms and legs, I could barely get upstairs to use the bathroom. I spent most of the trip in bed and felt very nauseous the first half but didn&#039;t vomit (had zero nausea when I did the MG seeds). After the nausea went away it wasn&#039;t bad but all I really did was lie in bed, not exactly what I consider fun. Once I started to come down enough that I wasn&#039;t tired and could move my arms and legs easier it was pleasant and euphoric.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i experimented with lower doses before finally tripping from 12 seeds. hbwr is very strange, as lower doses seem to be somewhat confusing (i could barely hold a conversation on a low dose) and the body load is insane... but when i reached a psychedelic dose it was the complete opposite, very lucid/clearheaded trip (comparable to clean lsd) and absolutely no body load. i was able to communicate just fine and my body felt light, if anything. a word of advice: never resist the nausea. if you have to throw up, do so. on my second trip (which was also with hbwr) i got very nauseous and spent the whole trip trying to ignore it, as i had a phobia of vomiting. that&#039;s the only &quot;bad trip&quot; i&#039;ve had and it was entirely due to my resistance and going into the experience with expectations--learn from my mistakes. resistance creates tension which leads to anxiety. purging during a trip releases negative energy and feels very cleansing.

				i have only tripped once but it was the most amazing experience of my life.&nbsp; It helped me with a lot of personal things i was going through at the time as well.<br />My partner and I took 2 and a half tabs each (took one and thought it wasn&#039;t doing anything so took the other 1 and a half).&nbsp; First were playing cod started getting tingling body sensations and the giggles.&nbsp; I then went to the toilet, while sitting in there i couldn&#039;t stop staring at the floor, the plain white tiles had turned into beautiful colors of kaleidoscopes my head kept telling me you have been in here for ages but it was so beautiful i couldnt look away&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ... my partner put on music and i looked at the walls and instead of hearing the music i could see it coming a vibrant green waves through the walls, looked at myself in the mirror and was in awe, my face looked like it was painted in the mirror and my eyes glimmering.... after a considerable amount of time (could have been a long time but who really knows&nbsp; :o ) i came out to a different world.&nbsp; It was like i was in a painting colors seemed different walls were bowing or rippling. sat back in the lounge listened to some music while getting used to the feeling, ihad to keep wondering around couldnt sit still it was like i was seeing things for the first time.&nbsp; <br />about an hour into it my partners dad (who had tripped plenty of times in his day) decided he was going to take us on and i quote &quot;A Magical Mystery Tour&quot; ... &quot;We need sunglasses first guys and we are off&quot; (it was the middle of the day and our pupils covered our eyes) but to people we looked strange as it was one of the rainiest/stormy/windy days on record in a long time&nbsp; ;D <br />We drove around a bit both me and my partner in the back listening to the radio and the host was very funny cause nothing they said made sense.&nbsp; At one point they refereed to the weather as raining cats and dogs and that tipped us over in fits of laughter for ages looping at laughing&nbsp; ;D<br />Our magical mystery tour driver decided to take us to the beach ... when we arrived there both my partner and i had realised we were at our beach ( we have this beach we always go to hold both good and bad points in our relationship but very meaningful) the very trippy part was neither of us had told him about this beach so we were in amazement at how he could have picked this one out of hundrends in the area (still amazes me to this day).. got out of the car and walking around in the 100km/hr wind rainy weather that to any straight person would have frozen but we couldnt stop laughing! we have photos from when we were at the beach and the smiles on our faces compared the the surrounding is just hilarious :D<br />watching the waves rolling in onto the beach was incredible it was like i could feel the energy coming from the water and there were small cracks in the clouds where the sun was setting the beams of color and the feeling from them both is something i can never describe. I remember looking at all the colors so vibrant and beautiful.<br />After the beach our trip leader took us to a shop that sells furniture and home wears, my partner and i wondered around while our leader got what he needed, we both were absorbed with the music area. Found a rug there that was a shaggy rug and remember having this urge to roll around on it (luckily i didnt but really wish i did now&nbsp; ;D ) weird funny things kept going on here just making stupid remarks about different furniture and how funny it was, i remember people looking at us as we walked through. <br />getting onto around the 5 hour mark now holding my partner eyes closed being driven around again, it was like we were talking to each other through our minds, not saying anything out loud.<br />we get back home and start having a few beers and listening to more music, we were show a lot of music from Beatles, led Zeppelin, and the woodstock days,absolutely amazing music felt really connected to it.&nbsp; <br />I felt like winding down a bit so i smoked a few cones and had a few more beers was getting around the 9-10 hour mark and was starting to feel really tired .... after this dont remember much until waking up the next morning. <br />The whole experience was very spiritual, connecting, fun, exciting, mysterious but all round i felt like a kid again! <br />I have a massive appreciation now for sunsets and sunrises that i never had before my trip, learning to take in the things we may take for granted. <br />I havent tripped again since i really want to but i feel i may have high expectations as this was so amazing to me.&nbsp; I think also having my partners dad there helped us both a lot as we didnt know what to expect and he really guided us through it. <br />

				My first trip was quite recently with 2c-b, just a small amount about 20mg. Had no idea what to expect and was quite nervous on the day leading up to it, I then nearly set fire to the house, this was before the trip, and was so relieved that we hadn&#039;t burned to death that I calmed right down.<br /><br />At first I didn&#039;t think anything had happened and that we&#039;d been ripped off but soon after I went outside and noticed that I could see the trees breathing, the sky was immense and I felt connected to it all. As the sun was setting I nearly cried at how beautiful the colours were. We went back inside and felt hungry which I didn&#039;t expect, I then ate the best cheese sandwich of my life, as I closed my eyes I saw the cow who made the cheese smiling at me and started laughing uncontrollably.<br /><br />Suddenly as I opened my eyes I saw duck faces everywhere, I love ducks for some reason, and they were all winking at me, laughter resumed. Me and my mate chatted for some hours, deeper than we had for a long time. The whole time I felt incredibly sexual, the body sensitivity was unreal. In the absence of anyone to share this with (I don&#039;t think my mate was up for trying man-sex for the first time) I then went to bed and had the best wank of my life.<br /><br />Trying it again NYE after some MDMA as recommended by many (thanks again for your advice gtgeorgz!). Will report back on the experience! <br /><br />Have a wonderful NYE all!

Sometimes the visuals on 2c-b can get pretty weird and yeah it makes you very sexual indeed! But it&#039;s a lovely chemical, even better and more sexual after the MDMA peak wears off. Thats alright man, hope you have a good 2nd trip and let us know how it goes. :)

				my first psychedelic experience was with dmt. my friend was extracting it at the time and he sold me a tenth so i packed it all in the bowl with some marijuana underneath. my buddy guided me through how to smoke it while i was doing it, and after the first hit i remember gold and purple stars started to &quot;shake&quot; into my vision, creating a bubble like overlay with them over my vision, i told him i was feeling weird and he told me to hit it again so i took the longest toke i possibly could and this sent me. i remember hitting it the second time, leaning back until i was laying down on the bench i was on, rolling off of that onto the ground, and as soon as i made impact with the ground i popped through to this city that was made up entirely of these gel-like pyramid peices. they were pink and arranged in fascinating architectural ways. they were almost like legos in a way. all the same size and the way they peiced together was like velcro in a way. i was made up of this same material and i could feel the actual texture of my environment from the inside of my body, out. i was completely one with everything at this moment and it was amazing .when i initially came back to myself i was face first in the grass (not sure where the friends were there)-__- and i had a mouthfull of grass haha. my body was literally telling me it had to pee so i got up and while my friend was asking me how i was i pull my dick out because i have to pee, but i forget what im doing while hes talking to me. i eventually realized what the fuck i was doing and walked away to piss xD after that i walked back over to the front of his little studio room, i decided to lay in the grass under this enormous tree. when i closed my eyes i was seeing a room that at the time, seemed to be the database of my mind but it was very computer like. it slowly wore off to the point of just feeling good while i was laying there.<br />&nbsp;<br />dat was my first psychedelic experience :P<br />
