				I know you guys bruise easily but for god sake stop crying on reality tv. It&#039;s not ok to show public emotion PARTICULARLY if you are either a MAN. Just stop crying and welling up because it&#039;s just annoying and doesn&#039;t add anything to the program it just makes us think you may have gone to your therapists too many times and have become too in touch with your inner-emotional-self-child. <br /><br />Just chill the fuck out, take a deep breath, have a fag and IT WILL BE OK.

I know, Lim, that this might come to You as a surprise, but (normal) human beings have emotions and also we have tear ducts.

				the only american TV that is almost reality is stuff like ice road truckers, greatest catch, gold rush etc.<br /><br />i like the fact that its &#039;reality&#039; in a documentary sort of way, although the editing and heightened drama really fucking annoys you after a while.

				Let me lay this out. I love UK TV!!! As far as US adaptions, some have failed, some are good, and some should have never fucking been adapted in the first place. Fuck reality TV that is the most brain washing garbage I&#039;ve ever fucking seen...8 people living in a house getting drunk and fighting used to be called rehab now its fucking reality TV. I like both the American version and UK versions of The Office, it probably did so well due to Ricki Gervais&#039;s heavy involvement. I like the US verison of shameless couldn&#039;t get into the UK version. Peep show is fucking brilliant and should never be adapted to the US audience. Misfits was great but has slowly tapered off it is being adapted to the US its going to be fucking horrendous. Garth Marenghi&#039;s Dark Place is some of the funniest shit I&#039;ve ever watched High....Channel 4 is just awesome in general!!!
