				Im curious as to what you guys think. Is there really anything more powerful than money? Personally, I don&#039;t believe so. To elaborate, I&#039;d like to say that it is my personal belief that knowledge is the most powerful thing on this planet; however, I am not naive and realize that most people only care about money, and it&#039;s hard to be knowledgeable without access to cold hard cash. I don&#039;t think there isn&#039;t a thing on this planet that you can&#039;t buy. I think its a shame that so many people will do literally anything to get some cash, but thats just the way the world works I suppose

				the only thing more powerful than money is the bankers controlling it! i vote we should do away with all this bullshit and go back to a bartering system. sure there will be violence as groups form to survive but i think that would be better than this hell we live in today.<br />I ate some shrooms from MM earlier.

				^^^^ Gravity is a very weak force (I&#039;m beating the entire earth just by standing straight up). The strong nuclear force would be a better answer.

				yes, there is something more powerful than money.<br /><br />Why do men chase after money? Because they want to gain the attraction of females. The more money a man has, the hotter the woman he can get.<br /><br />SEX is more powerful than money. SEX is the root cause of our material attachment. Sex and women.<br /><br />If not for women, men wouldn&#039;t care about money.<br /><br />Women are the root cause of all of this insanity of the modern society, because women are biologically programmed to look for the man with the largest amount of resources, aka money.<br /><br />Women truly are the embodiment of maya, the illusion.

				Ive heard stories of famouus people with an entourage and they would play mind games with their followers, getting them to think/do whatever they wanted. There are people very skilled at this. All the money in the world probably wouldnt get a normal person to kill sombody. Charlles Manson got his followers to do what he wanted and he had very little wealth.

				Almost everybody has responded tongue in cheek. But what do you mena by powerful? You mean that it gives you power, as in getting stuff or power over others?
