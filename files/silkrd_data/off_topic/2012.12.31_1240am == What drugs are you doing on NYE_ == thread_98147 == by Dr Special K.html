				I vote quinone and lemon hook up and just fuck nonstop into the dawn of a new age.<br /><br />Sorry. Alcohol kicking in ;D I fully understand any negative karma points that may be coming my way for my distastefulness ::)<br /><br />Nah. I&#039;m no wise guy with touching philosophical sentences, but depression often turns people into some of the nicest, most kind and beautiful people on this planet. Whether you &quot;opt out&quot; or not, at least remember you HAVE added to this world for the better. You have made at least one person smile at least one time with your insight and kindness, and if that&#039;s the only thing your life ever surmounted to, well you fucking rule for just that. There are others out there with &quot;amazing lives&quot; that have only ever caused more harm than good, and you are not one of them.<br /><br />...or something along those lines.

(a year is 365.2422 day&#039;s, that&#039;s why we round up 1 day every 4 years as a &#039;leap year&#039;.&nbsp; We&#039;d lose time too quickly over a century so we add 0.25 days until a year which is actually only 0.2422 day&#039;s shorter then this arbitrary gregorian decision we made back in the 1500&#039;s which makes up for the loss by rounding up an already rounded up number to 365.25 day&#039;s, when its actually 11.323 minutes shorter (0.25 - 0.2422 days).&nbsp; So you all best be banging your shit or whatever ritual it is you do when you think it&#039;s actually exactly midnight 11 minutes earlier cuz when &#039;the ball drops&#039; we&#039;re already well into the new year ... *doh*).<br /><br />Decided to take a bunch of benzos (nothing abnormal there heh), and some oxy&#039;s ... cuz ... why the fuck not.&nbsp; So you aren&#039;t alone, let&#039;s just have our own secluded New Year&#039;s ... secluded ... at least I know when the fucking year actually ends :D<br /><br />Quinone<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFAuDmsBCADNbu3iWQ1wGQFP5SA8X0Bk5DEtmpRw0wZvj5ecRHLWG6sUcHqf<br />GEOymPXgR+4IcFyBp5XV+XlXupPgf+EDNANjpieQ8rfLg0Uepfa39USie4k3N0BS<br />S5F+glv1mU0UH4/xUThEqc2a6c/LYoa4f2o+HKE/9jzc0GYP5FeRXart8rNS9LrA<br />ADS57CZKA0I3lTNHFSKiGr6+INihu54e4PX8Zaf+ZNviT7/O1l4xO/Ulbd1/jcMH<br />r8L0BRgOTLnoj1BHh7sps/AyRNeZ2ahdPu1LxdDLz8v5//jYA+FjHPXmwdFHr4kQ<br />SpkCLwJ+Gf+z5uy+ZDL8loDQATa6051C0RyNABEBAAG0HVF1aW5vbmUgPFF1aW5v<br />bmVAcXVpbm9uZS5jb20+iQE4BBMBAgAiBQJQLg5rAhsPBgsJCAcDAgYVCAIJCgsE<br />FgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRBjHlIvGV998GQlB/4594lahwKWbqoIqG7VfnoD6puHYaEQ<br />KZh76RpphoqPsVQEX/aYmJtgkKlXcXQIiavNid+DVtWdZbl6djg4dDUIra3FYRS3<br />rMfV6cEQ6SdVI1LVDim2sbJWZiDGcTo6QAEFSQo2gPSAMZ2kb7jBUTRiLaE7gjpQ<br />IUr9M9ZvrTDfjxexCAJkW1BdE8sg49oLhDBZhf9RCFfww/qL/VEoFTQX9R5nKLxT<br />63wYAwsUH4soi7A1TU75gPKbbZ0NkBOoKpp2LDtOr2jM62H2+SsMIabZtrw/kU6J<br />OliSsnH90FE7Z+98KC4FKztxjdgh7C/kjYIIleqBXUX4cmTdWdUQjUQK<br />=Ipre<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
