				Alright relax, now that we&#039;re all jumpy and ready to beat me for snitching. We&#039;re not talking about The Road. Not even the offline Substance market: I&#039;ve got a problem with a crazy.<br /><br />That problem has a name, two hands, two feet, and a history of bribing the law so they&#039;ll look the other way while he burns people to death - and apparently now it&#039;s my turn. So FBI is the only answer. Obviously: Get evidence/witness list together before I even talk to them, calm the hell down, try to sleep. Try not to be worried sick every day.<br /><br />Has anyone done this before? If I go in for a meeting (I&#039;m not guilty of anything here) did you just pass metal detectors, or did you get the sniffdown from Special Agent Paws?

				Ok, so it took me like 6 times of reading this to actually understand what OP was asking.<br />The FBI is asking you to come in for an interview/questioning/meeting about a serious crime you&#039;ve witnessed, correct? And you&#039;re wondering if they&#039;re going to search you like mad, question you about everything possible and figure out you&#039;re using SR and blahblahblah, right?<br />Here&#039;s what you don&#039;t do:<br />-get high. leave it for after you&#039;re out of there.<br />-bring anything illegal with you. this also includes any knives, guns, nail clippers, lighters...basically anything you absolutely don&#039;t need. bring your ID, and that&#039;s it.<br />-seem sketchy. if you don&#039;t freak, they won&#039;t freak.<br />-say stupid shit. anything that has to do with anything other than the case at hand...shut up. (yes, i stress the word anything)<br />-be unprepared. write down any questions you have for them. compile your own evidences/witness lists/etc. makes the process smoother.<br /><br />Just be prepared for an entire search. So take a nice shower, put on decent clothes, and prepare to be searched like you&#039;re getting on a plane (at least). It&#039;ll probably be just like entering a court house-your shit gets x-rayed and you go through a metal detector. You might also just walk through the door and not be really searched much....idk. Just expect the full shebang and you&#039;ll be more at ease.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be alright.<br />Bring us tasty info about whatever you can get!!<br />P.S. cameras will be everywhere, i&#039;m sure, so don&#039;t pick your nose. And yes, they will be recording everything you say and everything you do (insert george carlin voice).<br />Good luck.
