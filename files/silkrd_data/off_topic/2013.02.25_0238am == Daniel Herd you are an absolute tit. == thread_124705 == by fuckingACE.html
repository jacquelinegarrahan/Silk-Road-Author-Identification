				I&#039;ll keep it simple as I don;t have much time. <br /><br />1. Next time you fell like insulting one of the people that works for me, do it though me. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121408.75<br /><br />2. Next time you feel like calling someone that I personally know to be an amazing person KITKAT, or TB an attention seeker for seeking help from a loving and strong community in a time of desperate need please shoot yourself, you don&#039;t deserve to be a part of our community. <br /><br />3. Refrain from sending her personal messages... They serve to embarrass you, here is an interesting one cp and pasted: <br />&quot;Lol, wow. You sound like such a faggot. Stop being such a pussy. I have more money than you&#039;ll have in your life kid. You fat piece of shit, neck beard living in your parents basement.<br />I eat pussys like you for breakfast.<br />Acting all hard on the internet.<br />You&#039;re a pathetic virgin. Just die already, fool.&quot;<br /><br />Now just to clear some points, shes not a kid, check the avatars our team uses, also check our hash listing pics,<br />As for being a pussy, I don&#039;t see you selling anything on here, or apporting anything of any value. In fact all I see is you hiding behind an anonymous user name throwing unfounded, childish and cowardly accusations... On the other hand, she alone is responsible for the entire domestic shipping dept and BTC exchange side of a renowned and popular seller account with 99.5% positive feedback mostly thanks to her, that made it to top 19% in under two months and made over 5000$ dollars revenue in the last week. Not to mention that a large majority of customers state repeatedly that we have the best product on the road. <br /><br />Also she is deffo not a virgin&nbsp; ;D aight, know her personally. <br /><br />Also the only pussy you eat for breakfast is your neighbors can when your mum forgets to bring you extra pop tarts<br /><br />I would love to go into an indepth slagging match with you as I am in a bad mood today, but I don&#039;t want an ear bashing from scout. <br /><br />SO lets leave it as this, you don&#039;t buy from us or any of the sellers that chose to listen to our warning about you on the private vendors forum, no sellers like to deal with unpredictable children, mainly to protect their good name. <br /><br />You don&#039;t message her or any other member of my team again that is if she hasn&#039;t blocked you already, <br /><br />You don&#039;t insult valued members on the forums, sellers or not. And you stop being such a selfish prick picking on peoples worries and weaknesses to make yourself feel a little bigger than the unfortunate circumstances life has thrown at you have you believe. . <br /><br />ACE<br />ACE from TSC <br /><br /><br />

				Listen up you fucking joke of a fuckstick. You always had it in for TrashBox right from the start. Are you jealous of the fact she gets attention here on SR forums from guys b/c she is a woman or b/c she has a personality you’ll never have. You don’t send someone a PM like that you cowardly little fuck, you say it on Main like someone who has balls. She is no attention seeker and can say what she likes. Whether or not you are a shill for joywind we will never know. But if you have a problem with her you have a problem with me. <br /><br />Kind of weird how she has only been here a short time but has in that time managed to be one of the most popular females on SR forums, made a bunch of friends here, and snapped up as a vending partner. What about you? Well, take a look at your fucking Karma. <br /><br />And as for that fucking dipshit blueveil or whatever fucking dumb name you call yourself, to tell kitkat she should kill herself or shut up? I hope your dick gets gangrene. Oh wait…….. you don’t have one. You waited an hour for me to log off after I said I was taking a few days off SR forums to post your cowardly little reply. So you mustn’t have a dick to start with. I didn’t know kitkat myself but I wasn’t stupid enough to say it was a publicity stunt or whatever the fuck you were driveling out of that hole in your face you call q mouth. According to your cracked logic, everyone who is female and say they are having suicidal thought are seeking attention? You already admitted you come to the forums to simply “have a bit of a laugh” and “drum up business”, well good luck with that b/c I thik you have lost your female clientele you dumb fuck. Have fun selling to males only and tell me when you are on the street ha ha sheeeeeeeeeit. Lulz!<br /><br />If either of you retards bothered to read either of the member’s posts you both COWARDLY attacked behind their backs (also me, you waited till I logged off, man you are such a dumb motherfucker, Raz doesn’t have to be on SR forums to know what is going on here. Soon as I heard I came back to write this up for TrashBox), you would realise how fucking dumb you guys are. Kitkat already said she “got it” on Flush’s thread and as for TrashBox, if you bothered to read her latest posts you would figure her out, but you didn’t because you both are lazy fucker s who just come her to troll. Well, you can both go fuck yourselves because she had achieved on Silk Road and the forums more than you have twice that long and will make it here, you two won’t, you’re already history. Check The Scurvy Crew’s stats. Now check your pathetic offerings. Who’s the fuck stick now? Yeah dickheads, next time you troll someone research who the fuck you’re trolling.<br /><br />It it was up to you guys there would be no females here as, according to you guys, they are all attention seekers. Man, are you sure your mothers weren’t taking a shit when they delivered you and the doctor made a switch?<br /><br />Some people here are too polite to troll back. But I am Raz and you obviously don&#039;t know how I got my name in the first place and I am more than happy to call you out. And don’t go sobbing to admin or mods b/c [edit.]. No one cares about you runny little eyes.<br /><br />Neither of you have contributed in the slightest on the forums, I know your posts. Blueveil, you’ve done stuff all since you got here last year. DaneilHerd, you don’t do anything but troll. You always had it in for TrashBox even as a newbie and now I know why,.Both you guys suffer from a hatred complex for successful females and try to use her flirting&nbsp; posts as justification to run her down. Why did you feel compelled to write her a PM instead of using Main? Oh that’s right, your dick is too short.<br /><br />I’m not on forums any more as nearly as much but if you fuck with my friends I will fuck with you and I don’t need to be on forums in order to know and I don’t need to hear from TrashBox in order to know, I will know. <br /><br />Got anything to say to her? Say it to her face and not behind her back (same with kitkat and myself, you’re so small-dicked you had to wait till we were both gone) and grow some balls.<br /><br />Got anything you’d like to contribute on my post? Good, I’ll be here for the next 30, if you wait until I’m gone it just makes you look an even bigger dickhead than you are already.<br /><br />Also if ACE hadn’t put this PM up you would have prolly got away with it. You’re a dick-fuck DanielHerd. You and I are always going to have a problem starting from now. Don’t give my friends a hard time or I will give you a hard time. Have gotten to know TrashBox in the short time she’s been here but you guys never will, and that is your loss. (Ha ha….. sheeeeeeeeeeit.) Dude I can sit here and troll you fuckers as many times as posts you can make to put people down b/c you both were born with a dog shit in your corpus collosum instead of a brain. Might be amusing actually. Same way it was amusing to fuck Rocky/Northern Star up the ass. (Lol, taking on nomad, what the FUCK was he thinking? Lol! nomad has the whole of SR, SR forums and even that shitty little Silk Chat for preteens even AFTER he’s gone, who has [edit.] got? Exactly. (No offense [edit.], I know [edit.] what nomad has cannot be taken away by some [edit.] pretends he’s a vendor. Pfff! What the fuck was it all about anyway? Don’t want to pick a fight but… nomad? Why the fuck would anyone have a problem with him for fuck’s sake! God lol!))<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />+K ACE. Can’t TrashBox, 72 hr rule, god knows she needs it for having to put up with this juvenile bullshit.<br /><br />-1 DanielHerd, blueveil. If you’ve come here to troll fuck off. I&#039;ll remove this post and make my own temporary thread if ACE thinks this is too strong, if YOU think it&#039;s too strong, take a pill and go fuck yourself. Or better yet, perhaps you should consider killing yourself b/c you mommy is a tad embarrassed that she went to take a dump and you came out instead. <br /><br />[Edit. Looking back, this post WAS a bit harsh. Oh well. It&#039;s not like I give a shit or anything lulz. Oh, managed to hit TrashBox in back of head with my fluffy +K stick, 72 hr rule must have just expired! Yay! :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-* :-*]

				Wow, just wow. Ace, Raz, I had no idea you thought so highly of me... I was in tears, I&#039;m so touched. Seriously, you two... I LOVE YOU&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s taken me a little while to respond to this thread because I&#039;ve thought a lot about what to say. So here goes&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Because of the nature of what we do here I can&#039;t reveal too much about myself that people irl would know. The fact that this place is anonymous means I can share things that I actually do want to discuss but will never be able to share with my irl friends and family. I can&#039;t go on facebook and post I WANT A HARD FUCK SO BAD RIGHT NOW because, well, because my IRL circumstance doesn&#039;t allow it. If I could, I fucking would, believe you me. <br /><br />It&#039;s also come to my attention that some members might feel too intimidated to PM me... that&#039;s crazy! I&#039;m super nice (as long as you&#039;re nice to me) and I love meeting new people on here. Seriously. In the 3 months I&#039;ve been here I&#039;ve &quot;met&quot; more interesting, incredible, and LOVING people than I have ever met in real life. I mean I had some cool, intelligent friends in college, but not as saturated as this forum is.... I used to think I was a smarty pants... but this forum has me feeling like a fool sometimes. I&#039;ve stared reading more books since I got here, too. Thanks to Ace and DPR&#039;s book club. Which brings me to my next point...<br /><br />I spend a lot of time here because I FUCKING GET PAID TO BE HERE. Thanks to Ace I have this awesome, amazing, incredible, fantastic, FUCKING JOB where I get to sit on my (perfectly heart-shaped) ASS and talk about sex all day long. This isn&#039;t your typical clearnet internet forum for children wanting to discuss &quot;which weed is dankest&quot; or &quot;how do you ask for molly at a rave&quot; bullshit... <br />This is a fucking MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY, child, and looks to me like you aren&#039;t selling anything.

				TRASHBOX :) <br /><br />Just putting out a notice that PM is glitching. I&#039;ve decided to leave forums for today after I write on Main until this site can get its acts together. Not sure what it is, but this site has had a shit load of tech problems that have been increasing in the last month. More later.<br /><br />This is a sub, a bump, and a notice. Some of us do sex chat , --probably you TrashBox!, :) -- so keep that in mind. Seems to send it to yourself for some reason when you click on Reply. Whatever it is, needs to be fixed asap. As if the mods didn&#039;t already have their hands full with dirty little spammers and now this coins problem at SR marketplace. Some of us need PMs -- like me. Not for sex chat, for other stuff, so I hope this is fixed soon.<br /><br />I&#039;ll report when I can give a stuff. <br /><br />THIS THREAD IS AWESOME!!!&nbsp; &gt;:D &gt;:D &gt;:D

On this forum I have to bookmark the genuine people to make sure I don’t lose them with the trash I find here, so TrashBox, consider yourself bookmarked. ;) <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124705.msg859374#msg859374">Quote from: MagicMan on February 25, 2013, 09:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Feeding trolls is a poor way of combating them. We all KNOW that kitkat and TB are good people, it is highly unlikely that some random punk spouting off on the forum can/will change that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />MagicMan, here’s the deal. Life throws things up that you choose to either deal with or take the easy option. Do you think I enjoyed writing that? I don’t troll back usually. But this situation, it would have been callous and cowardly not to, after someone was attacked by a cowardly little man (btw Daniel, how much money do you have?) in a cowardly little PM. Blueveil needed to be called out as well, as, A) he has no spyne, as he waits until people are offline to troll them, and B) telling someone to kill herself when she is already contemplating suicide is one THE dumbest things you can do. <br /><br />So no offense, but I disagree with the above advice on not to troll, least this time. Good advice? Yes, most occasions it is, and I take that advice. But this was one occasion I felt I had to come back to forums and I totally stand by my decision. Not doing so would have been an ethical mistake. Things are not always what they seem at first sight, anyway, my post is newbie-friendly meaning I’ve filled in gaps so people can easily understand what this issue was about.<br /><br />And I think it HAS achieved something MagicMan. Look at the comments on this page and tell me anyone reading this has not come closer to a better appreciation. And I think that these two little dumb fucks have learned their lesson so it&#039;s a win-win situation. Anyway, I don&#039;t do this normally. If it has to be said it&#039;s gonna be said if it doesn&#039;t it doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />I’m not too worried at all to be seen as trolling, just worried about being seen as someone that left someone on heir own b/c I had no spyne to say something. Anyway, as yu can see this thread is starting to turn into an appreciation thread full of support for TrashBox so I really don’t see it as a problem. So no, I did not encourage him, rather discouraged him (both fucks). Now they know they can’t get away with this kind of bullshit especially to a friend of Raz’s. <br /><br />(God lol, you think I was spouting? You really think I got time to spout? I thought you knew me better than that lol. I&#039;ve already phucked up slightly by coming here in first place, should not even be here and am going soon.)<br /><br />PrincessHIGH, I had no idea you had that side lol, I have never before seen it. ::)&nbsp; I hope to God I don’t ever get on your bad side b/c I have seen the way you conduct yourself on the forums and IMAHO if it’s possible to piss you off, then that person is beyond help. These two below average people have cut themselves off from two great people IMAHO. I feel sorry for them, they won’t know you and TrashBox the way others have gotten to know you, their loss. WE have, and are grateful for that.<br /><br />TrashBox, fact that you kept this even though it had been going on for a month makes these two trolls look even dumber. An attention-seeker does not do that. If there is any attention seeker here, it is Daniel Herd and blueveil as they both were stupid enough to post nasty messages to multiple people on kitkats’s thread and then had the hide to PM you with vitriol. <br /><br />So TrashBox muffin? In future? You TELL ACE AND YOUR FRIENDS WHAT IS GOING ON. Don’t keep silent about it. <br /><br />Anyway, this thread has ironically brought out the best and not the worst. If you wondered about your back up this is it. In big fucking letters spelled out nice and clear to anyone wishing to have a go at you in the future. Enjoy the rest of your day. At least some of us actually have a life. Chat later? <br /><br />Raz.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters. <br /><br />[Edit. Those quotes that TrashBox posted from DH was not all he said, there was another nasty comment but that is not up I see, it was around January I think on the sex thread.]

				... if anybody is inclined to think he knows what he&#039;s talking about, regardless of anything else, he&#039;s wrong about what borderline personality disorder is.&nbsp; That&#039;s... so, not what the hallmark symptoms are.&nbsp; I think you need to read the DSM entry again, Daniel, and this time pay attention to the list of major diagnostic symptoms without interpreting them wrong.

We&#039;re living in the twenty first century, woman living in the free world are free to be who they want to be and do what they want to do.

Too many girls have committed suicide over stupid gutless comments like those in your PM and that loser blueveil comes from the same bucket of shit as you.

I kept my mouth shut for a good amount of time while I watched kitkat play the &quot;I&#039;m a female please pay attention to me internet&quot; card like a thousand times, but this is just taking it too far. Honestly I know people with organ failure so if you want to take your life I completely understand. Just please don&#039;t involve this entire community into your drama. Again I am not unsympathetic to people with problems both mental and physical but this type of behavior is the same kind when you see a person put shallow cuts into themselves saying they want to kill themselves. I honestly think you need to put down all substances and seek a good mental health professional before you take this stunt too far to turn back. I know things look bad in the world and your health maybe in the crossfire right now, but its never worth taking your own life.<br /><br />I see the &quot;I&#039;m a female please pay attention to me internet&quot; card as definately one that Trashbox always plays, and the &quot;im female and im talking about sex&quot; attention grab, it is quite annoying, definately easy to see through if you think about it, why would an attractive female need to find attention on a drugs forum ?<br /><br />Peace, Love, and Happiness 2 all.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Quote from: blueveil on February 23, 2013<br />exactly......... +1 sir +1. That was the subtle point I was getting at too. What decent female needs to find solace in a drug forum for the kind of attention that has been spewed on these forums? I post here to drum up business and enjoy a good laugh with the other vendors from time to time on the ridiculousness of this place sometimes. Between the tinfoil and the drama lama&#039;s I don&#039;t know who to verbally slap first.<br /><br />And to the other person complaining about the use of the word stunt. Sorry but that is what it is. If you talk about it and claim you did it, then your having a change of heart. I can&#039;t take someone like that seriously at all with there own emotions if they can flip flop between wanting to live and die. I&#039;ve also seen some fucked up things in my time and my body isn&#039;t what I would like it to be either but I&#039;m not about to bring my personal drama on here(on another account mind you), and boo hoo to the site that I&#039;m killing myself. Again this is the same behavior when I see girls, and I do mean GIRLS put shallow cuts on their arms and claim they were trying to kill themselves its a cry for help and I really don&#039;t take them seriously other than to tell them to go talk to a mental health professional if you need real help. But I will not pander to this behavior and act like it&#039;s to be taken seriously over the internet of all places silk road........<br /><br />tldr: Kill yourself or shut up. (seriously though never kill yourself, it&#039;s not worth it)&quot;<br /><br /><br />This should be the last of it. Don&#039;t come back to twist things up again. Hopefully we can move in different directions but both of you idiots stay off any thread I&#039;m on. Or you will have problems. Luckily for you it&#039;s not that hard. But if I find either DanielHerd or blueveil come up on the +Karma thread you&#039;ll be negged not plussed. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters

				Cooler, you probably wasted more time in hitting the return key to post some dullard comment that nobody gives a fuck about than I did. <br />I posted this thread&nbsp; generally advising people to care for the community, not to harass other members and to treat people in difficulty with respect and humility. <br /><br />So lets analyse this quickly: <br /><br />I spent a few minutes contributing to the SR community by advising against bullying and harassing other members, advising that should a person need emotional support and advice it should be given without flaming and without trying to make yourself feel better by making other people feel small. <br />&nbsp;and you spent a few minutes hitting the return key and posting some utterly retarded statement, that you think is funny, but that everyone else thinks is utter shite.. Keep scrolling, really?! do you not have anything else to do in special school?? like finger painting or single digit multiplication.. Do you really think anyone finds anything you say remotely amusing? Furthermore, who the fuck are you and why are you on this thread. <br />Tits or gtfo?! The only tits you´ve seen are your mothers disheveled knee length droopy fun bags, so I understand your prepubescent lust for some quality tits, I advise you to look at my avatar They belong to TB. <br /><br />Right, as for flame wars, this isn´t one,&nbsp; its advice, if someone is feeling suicidal, you treat them with care and respect.&nbsp; Kindly fuck off to the newb section and post your fucking usless shit there, where people will probably find it amusing. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />

That will just prove my point on how immature, childish and brain dead you truly are. I can safely assume that in this forum, you get this sense of freedom that you &quot;run&quot; the show, that it&#039;s &quot;your&quot; world, and that your opinion is the only one that matters the rest are just &quot;haters&quot; and &quot;trolls&quot; or a person with hundred of different accounts because nobody else can have their own opinion. I honestly don&#039;t know what to say to that other than you&#039;re delusional but I mean that&#039;s understandable, in the real world you&#039;re probably a sad sad little person with a shit ton of issues and a miserable life (I&#039;m sorry I had to do this, I&#039;m just giving you some of your own medicine, I really hate blatantly insulting people like that because I hate stooping to your level of name calling). Other than that, I respect your opinion, even though if I don&#039;t agree with it. I know my &quot;TITS or GTFO&quot; comment might of seemed very &quot;rude&quot;, &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;annoying&quot; but it was meant to point out the uselessness in this thread. And I&#039;m sure MatchBox or whatever she goes by didn&#039;t request for you sticking up for her, if she did, I mean wow. That just makes her look like a total attention whore. (No offense). Please I&#039;m looking forward to your response(s). I&#039;m willing to bet 1/4 of your response will be some random babble, name calling, accusing me of being someone else, and some other bullshit. <br /><br />Stay classy. ;)<br /><br />~ Cooler.<br /><br />

				Sorry to hear about that KitKat and I hope you&#039;re doing better. I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;m a bit puzzled by the behavior of some of the people here and am not a big fan of people airing out their dirty laundry, but I do wish anyone the best of luck if they&#039;re having suicidal thoughts. <br /><br />What I DON&#039;T understand is people disrespecting other users simply because they have a different mindset here (and believe me, that goes both ways). I lent KitKat 0.5 bitcoins a while ago and when she didn&#039;t pay me back, I posted about my frustration to the boards (without actually calling here out). I then received this message from PurpleLotus after he offered to pay the tab for her: <br /><br />&quot;Why did you tell me... &quot;Wow, thanks Lotus, I really appreciate the gesture! Seeing as kitkat appears to be having some serious mental issues right now&quot;<br /><br />Because the story I heard was that you were bitching about what at the time was $9? What kind of man does that to a woman? Especially if he thinks &quot; Wow, thanks Lotus, I really appreciate the gesture! Seeing as kitkat appears to be having some serious mental issues right now&quot;?<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious, are you really a woman?&quot; <br /><br />Go fuck yourself Lotus.

				Yeah, I do think you were unreasonable. It was $9. I&#039;ve given fronts and made loans, yeah some people just run off, but I found if I just was cool with them that 90% of the time I got paid just fine and it was always a number much larger than $9. <br /><br />Most people who I am willing to help out and give them credit come back and tip me even more when they finally do get their coins.<br /><br />What is even more unreasonable is the fact that you are being a drama queen by even mentioning it... again it was just $9. Why are you still making it an issue? It was over a month ago.<br /><br />If you need the money that bad, then don&#039;t loan it out. You loaned out $9 which has caused you a great deal of stress... next time, don&#039;t do it.

				Again this isn&#039;t about the fucking money, it&#039;s about your reaction to it. If my behavior was a 5 on the douche scale, then yours was a 9.5. Hurdling childish taunts (&quot;are you really a woman?&quot;) and telling me how big your e-peen is probably isn&#039;t the way to explain how you feel. And you&#039;re kind of a drama queen yourself, given your original comment to me... <br /><br />But whatever mate, this obviously got blown out of proportion and I apologize if I took things too far.

I could ask you the same thing. You type like a human, though your avatar looks like, well, an avatar. the blue disney pixar kind. I think it is from star wars, though... or star trek... I always get those two mixed up. <br /><br />Anyway, to answer your question. Yes, Ace is a man. Those are MY boobs in his avatar pic. I am a woman and Ace is my boss. He likes my boobs.
