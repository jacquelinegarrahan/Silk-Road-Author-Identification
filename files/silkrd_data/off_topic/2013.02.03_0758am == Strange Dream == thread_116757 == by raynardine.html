				Title: <strong>Strange Dream</strong><br />

				So I was sleeping just a short moment ago, and I was dreaming. Usually my dreams make a lot of sense, if they aren&#039;t lucid (I know I am dreaming, and have fun with it).<br /><br />This once seems oddly significant, but I can&#039;t understand it.<br /><br />Basically, I dreamed that I burned down a friend&#039;s detached garage, then called the fire department, then while I was walking away, the god Coyote spoke to me, and he lent me his strength.<br /><br />Some time passes, and suddenly, my ecovillage is being attacked by giant grubs, and huge grapes are growing like kudzu vine everywhere.<br /><br />The god Coyote asks me curiously why I chose to use his power to create wine, and I answered that I did not intend to, that I felt myself desire wine, and it was there, along with grape seeds and some potted grape vines. My ecovilliage planted them, and they took over everything, and then giant grubs started appearing, attacking the vines.<br /><br />This is the first time I have had a dream about the god Coyote, which is why I find it so unique.<br /><br />Coyote is my god. I dislike admitting to a religion, but the significance of this dream could only make sense if I admitted that the god Coyote is a character I quietly revere.<br /><br />So if any of you who are more familiar with dreams and prophecy think you might have something to assist me in understanding this dream, I&#039;d appreciate it.

				Oddly, although in the dream, I was sure it was Coyote, the face of the person seems blurry to me now. Anyway, I have decoded the dream now that the shock and grogginess has receded.<br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t reveal what it means. I hope you understand.
