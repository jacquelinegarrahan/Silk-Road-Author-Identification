				Last night I dreamed that they made a new rule that tied karma into your buyer stats, sort of. If you had over a certain amount of neg karma you couldn&#039;t make orders and I was freaking out because for some reason I had like -500 karma or something and was trying to beg you guys to still let me stay. Hilarious now, but I woke up very frightened!<br /><br />Anyone else had SR infiltrate their dreams??

				Cicero has had many dreams. Cicero&#039;s dreams are explanations of the future. Cicero&#039;s dreams often foretell of doom and disaster.<br /><br />The world often quakes when the almighty Cicero dreams.

				Occasionally, when I have a package or two on the way, I have really bad nightmares about it being discovered by the wrong hands.&nbsp; Once I had a dream that I got a free sample of something I didn&#039;t order.&nbsp; Too bad I woke up before I got to try it.&nbsp; :P

				Yeah, I&#039;ve had quite a few of these. Most of them good, like extra goodies and shit i didn&#039;t order. But like the guy above me I didn&#039;t get to try them in time. A couple times my house got raided by the feds, searching for that quarter gram of molly i may have stashed somewhere, lol.

				Yeah, I had a really fucking weird one the night before last. I must have fallen asleep whilst replying to a post by Raoul Duke. I dreamt that I was waiting for a package to arrive and watching some TV when there&#039;s a knock at the door. I open it up and its Raoul from fear and loathing hes rolling so hard I kept trying to explain that I needed him to fuck off as I had drugs arriving and he was drawing attention to the house by being so high. he kept asking me for bitcoins and he said he would leave If i gave him some. then I woke up

				yea I had a dream that there was a silk road tour bus visiting every major city in the world. I went to my major city when it was there. The best rock&#039;n&#039;roll bands were appearing at each city they showed up in. It was a fucking mega party. Nobody knew who anybody was except we all knew that we were members of SR. Each time they moved on they would have followers go with them like the dead heads followed the grateful dead.<br /><br />I don&#039;t dream but when I do it becomes a reality with in 2 years

				Ohhh I have had those dreams where you get so close to doing drugs then you wake up too! I&#039;m usually in a massive mansion somewhere and there&#039;s dozens of floors and hundreds of rooms and I know there&#039;s a giant treasure trove of my fav in one of the rooms but I can&#039;t find which room, and when I finally do I am just about to do some then I wake up. <br /><br />It&#039;s weird sometimes my brain can play tricks on me and if I do drugs in my dream I really will feel high in my dream. Like with cocaine I feel my teeth go numb and opiates I get the warmth... if only I could stay.

				I have a dream, that the world will become a truly peaceful place, free of force fraud and coercion. <br /><br />I have a dream, that one day government becomes obsolete and all are free to make their own choices in life as they see fit.<br /><br />I have a dream, that technology will give power to the common man and allow him to break his chains.<br /><br />I have a dream, that Silk Road is the beginning of the end, the first step on the path that will set us free.<br /><br />I have... to stop getting so damn high.&nbsp; :-X
