				Sup guys, I&#039;ll be going out tonight and tomorrow night to a local after hours to sell, and I want any tips. I usually go in early, and pop a couple pills of MDMA then chill. I don&#039;t look like a drug dealer, whatsoever. No chains, no tattoos, not scruffy, well kept guy (actually last week, someone I overheard was looking for molly and when I asked him if he still needed some, he told me to bug off because he didn&#039;t believe I sold. I also go early so I can point out the people who are working security and who are staff in regular clothing, and to look at the other people who might be dealing/looking. I can make a good 400-800 a night, bringing in 50 pills, and I have a guy who buys off me and resells in the place at then same time as me. <br />I&#039;m finding it hard to ask people if they need some and what to do when they say no or if they assume that I&#039;m undercover or some shit . I pull up pill reports when they ask me if my shit is good, because the other stuff there is all methylone usually. People might sit down next to me and I&#039;ll ask if they&#039;re looking and it works out. Tomorrow I&#039;ll be giving freebies to a group of 8 that I&#039;ve seen every weekend for the past 4 weeks. Is there anything else I can do to bump my sales up a bit?

				Instead of increasing sales i would aim for increasing safety. Do you really need more than 500 dollars from one night out? Personally, i give my buddy as many pills as he thinks he can sell and he does it all. Cover the cost of the pills(1.50 per pill-ish) and split the remaining profit 50/50. Not a chance in hell of getting caught and still come out with 100-150 bucks. <br /><br />I would suggest just sticking to what you have now. You make a good amount of money. <br /><br />Bottom line, clubs are a fucking terrible place to sell drugs. WAY to much risk of getting caught, whether it be an undercover, security, bringing it in, a snitch, whatever, not worth it IMO.<br /><br />Also... why are you popping multiple pills? da fuq?

				if he&#039;s like me, when i thizz i get to this certain point i just start giving it away so i can vibe with everyone. but dont be me<br /><br />I would go with a few mates, and then relax with a pint until you see someone you know who partakes in those activities and have them tell their friends. etc. if you did it right, sold only to familiar faces, you&#039;ll be on your way!<br />Don&#039;t drink and drive. Take LSD and fly

If they&#039;re like most folks, there is probably a group out together, and very likely they didnt have enough to go around. <br />If you can pick out a couple people already rollin&#039;, kinda watch to see who they talk to. If you see someone come up to them for a second and then walk off, pretty good bet they are looking. That or they&#039;re security.<br /><br />My main tip to you though--<br />Dont get busted.
