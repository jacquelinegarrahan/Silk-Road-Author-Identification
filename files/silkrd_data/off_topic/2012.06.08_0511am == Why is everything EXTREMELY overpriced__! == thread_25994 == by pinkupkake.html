				Because people are apparently willing to pay at that price. If they can make a killing by raising the prices, then obviously it&#039;s going to happen. Only way to lower prices would be either a boycott (which is unlikely because the majority of customers don&#039;t read the forums), or for a seller to lower their prices dramatically with enough stock to keep up with the orders that way the other vendors would have to lower their prices as a result. Until one of these miracles happen, we&#039;re stuck with inflation or whatever and life&#039;s a bitch. ;D

				The stuff I buy mostly Beans (Which are crazy cheap) and Xanax Bars can be bought for $3.50-$5.00 a piece (is average street price) Even If I had to pay extra it&#039;s OK. I like the anonymity.

				Supply and demand determine price, just like in any free market.&nbsp; I happen to think my prices are cheap.&nbsp; Some will agree, some will not.&nbsp; I sell a fair amount, and you also have to factor in the possibility of going to prison!&nbsp; How much profit is enough when making a mistake means you could spend 30 years behind bars?<br /><br />I consider myself something of a master at beating Australian customs with steroids.&nbsp; I have never had liquid seized, nor any other package for that matter.&nbsp; This costs $30 extra if you want me to ship injectable steroids to Australia.&nbsp; Is that insane?&nbsp; Some people will say yes.&nbsp; But for that $30, the customer gets peace of mind.&nbsp; They will not go to jail.&nbsp; They will not have to sweat every single day from when I mail it to when they receive it.&nbsp; Again this is supply and demand.&nbsp; What is your freedom worth?&nbsp; Some people will go to a different dealer and buy a vial of testosterone that is the same price as mine without the surcharge for extra security and stealth packaging.&nbsp; That is how a market works.&nbsp; I deal with people who want the extra tranquility and will pay for it!<br /><br />What product do you think is most overpriced?&nbsp; How does the quality compare with what you buy irl?&nbsp; Are you sure that you are comparing like qualities?&nbsp; Some people say &quot;that is so expensive!!!&quot; when they see a new Honda Accord, but they drive a 10 year old Chevy Cavalier.&nbsp; Have they really compared them both side to side to see the difference in value?&nbsp; Of course they haven&#039;t.&nbsp; But they pretend that the new Japanese car is &quot;overpriced&quot; and you would be foolish to buy one.&nbsp; Maybe you are smoking weak home grown shake that you buy for $200 and ounce, and when you see top smoke for $75 an eighth you scoff.&nbsp; But which is actually giving you more bang for the buck?&nbsp; How much shit are you polluting your lungs with by smoking nasty low grade weed?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				O.o where the fuck are you seeing dubs for more than 30 bucks? Also, the main goal of alot of vendors is to move Weight. So you get slammin deals on bigger purchases, but in doing so, take more risk aswell.

				Also forgot to add that prices differ in areas. Availability has a major relation to price and as such, just because the price of an item is high for what is the norm in your area doesn&#039;t mean that it is high for someone in another area.

				to be fair its not that bad considering the quality of the stuff you get from here....<br />From where i live, <br />1 g Street MDMA = £40, But this shit is only okay, its mostly cut..<br />I got a gram of MDMA from Ivory for £43 and this stuff blew my fucking head off.. plus i use less and the quality is so much better.<br /><br />1g of street Methedrone = £25, but this shit is also cut<br />1g of SR methedrone from Googleeyed (hoping Lim&#039;s is gunna cheaper ;) ) = £27... again this works out better because i use less and the quality is so much better.<br /><br />Weed is a bit more complicated, because lets say i want a small amount.. i pay £10 for a &#039;ten bag&#039; of high grade, which is usually about 0.7grams. <br />On SR i can get 1 gram of super high quailty weed/hash for about £11-15. Which i&#039;d much rather do because it lasts a lot longer.<br /><br />Plus with SR you dont even have to leave your seat and it&#039;ll turn up in your mail box.... i mean, come on?! haha. To me the prices are worth it, its good value to me.

				It isn&#039;t true that everything is overpriced. A lot of things are.. but look at MDMA for example.<br /><br />You can get a gram of very pure shit for about £25. That&#039;s about 40% less than fucking STREET price, yet its incredible quality.

Personally after a few buys vendors will probably give you a custom discount if you want a specific order that they don&#039;t have listed. Then again some are too busy to entertain things like that and make too much of a killing off their normal listings to care.<br /><br />Btw Glocks I think you should change your signature to &quot;GAPES NOT RAPES&quot;..

				I just scored an ounce from Pot2Peer that is certainly some of the best weed I&#039;ve ever smoked... and the Grand Wizard has smoked a whole lot of weed in his day.&nbsp; The price including shipping was $195.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been able to get 5g bags of Durban Poison, a legendary landrace sativa, for $35 with shipping from RevenantChild. I got a quarter-ounce sack of Titan&#039;s Haze from NorCalKing that was absolutely primo smoke for around $40 (he doubled an order).&nbsp; Hell, from where I stand Silk Road is like Stoner&#039;s Groupon. There are all kinds of good reefer deals on here if you just keep your eyes peeled.&nbsp; I&#039;m paying half or less what I would buying on the street. <br /><br />Can&#039;t speak for other drugs, but the prices are certainly right for reefer on here.

				Right I agree with you but like I also stated. It&#039;s all about location, location, location. A quarter pound of mids here could go anywhere from 120-160. But somewhere like in west Virginia it can go for two to three times that if not more. Now here&#039;s the thing I have with buying coke off here. One of course would be that you don&#039;t know who your exactly dealing with and how said dealer handles their business. Two what the product could be cut with. Allot people really don&#039;t know what good coke is and can&#039;t distinguish the taste of speed. And three the anonymous part and the wait. If you know someone who can get it why on earth would you decide to buy some online and wait for it to come to your house a week later? Especially if you have it imported to you internationally.<br />That goes especially for meth and crack too. I can understand if you can&#039;t get it or are maybe to import stacks or something. But to buy a tiner for myself online when I can call up a few different people doesn&#039;t make sense to me with the risk involved.

I respectfully disagree with you on the part about the risks involved with ordering hard drugs online. IF you look at it people get pinched by LEO everyday in every city in America buying &amp;Selling small quantities of drugs Maybe there in a bad part of town,or there meeting a snitch who knows or the just look suspicious (LEO loves to use that line), But county jails are filled 24x7 with small time drug offenders, When compared to online anonymous ordering It&#039;s usually only the big fish LEO are even concerned with e.g. The woman up north who had 40LBS of weed delivered to her house. For me I have weighed the risks and also the quality it&#039;s much better for me to order online. To each his own, Much respect.

It&#039;s all about location, location, location. A quarter pound of mids here could go anywhere from 120-160. But somewhere like in west Virginia it can go for two to three times that if not more. Now here&#039;s the thing I have with buying coke off here. One of course would be that you don&#039;t know who your exactly dealing with and how said dealer handles their business. Two what the product could be cut with. Allot people really don&#039;t know what good coke is and can&#039;t distinguish the taste of speed. And three the anonymous part and the wait. If you know someone who can get it why on earth would you decide to buy some online and wait for it to come to your house a week later? Especially if you have it imported to you internationally.<br />That goes especially for meth and crack too. I can understand if you can&#039;t get it or are maybe to import stacks or something. But to buy a tiner for myself online when I can call up a few different people doesn&#039;t make sense to me with the risk involved.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yea you&#039;re right, but once I find a good vendor i continue to order from him.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also people on here wash the coke, making it much less dangerous and very much more euphoric.... good luck finding washed coke on the street.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />And again, because people like myself (who lives in a decently populated area)&nbsp; cannot get good coke,&nbsp; I prefer to order it online from a vendor who always delivers top notch stuff.&nbsp; <br />And I actually prefer to wait a week (in my case I order it and it actually comes in 3-4 days)&nbsp; and get good coke than trying to find it on the street.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I had a good connection that wasn&#039;t sketchy around here I would certainly pick up from him.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t and many people are in the same boat as me, so the price of $100 is worth paying.&nbsp; I also am pretty stingy with my money except when it comes to paying up for good drugs.&nbsp;
