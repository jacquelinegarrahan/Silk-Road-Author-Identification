				How does one get phished on SR? Or how can someone protect themselves from this?<br /><br />If it&#039;s something you downloaded, then you really need to be weary of what you&#039;re doing on the internet. If it&#039;s because javascript is enabled, then fucking disable that shit!

				&quot;How does one get phished on SR? Or how can someone protect themselves from this?&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this still happens, but people used to find this sight through the hidden wiki, which anyone can edit. So, they would be brought to a phishing sight that looked exactly like the normal one except the login screen would ask for your pin number to sign in. A lot of people got hacked that way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, make sure that your password is something complex and random. Something like Sdd6%as@dGy. Hackers use special programs that can determine a persons password: basically if your passphrase is a simple word that can be found in the dictionary, you are at a greater risk of getting hacked. <br /><br />Yes it is a pain in the ass to remember and keep track of but if you use different passwords for the various online services you use it decreases your chances of getting hacked.&nbsp;

				Like SSBD said everyone should be using some form of isolation, even if it&#039;s just a VPN configured into your router to provide IP address protection at a hardware level.<br /><br />On top of that I would never access TOR without an additional form of isolation such as Whonix and never access links from this forum outside of your Tor browser. The dreaded FBI CIPAV tool is believed to work by using various exploits hosted in webpages to trick your computer into sending your MAC address and hardware identifiers through an un-torified direct HTTP connection to an NSA controlled server. Using Whonix should completely protect you against this form of attack.<br /><br />As an extra level of security using anonymously obtained mobile internet will also protect you if all of your other security measures fail.

				They don&#039;t need your pin to withdraw funds. Just your username and password and they can transfer funds to another user or bit-coin address. Yes, fuck you too John the Baptist. Even if someone did use the same info to create an Atlantis account it does not mean they deserve to be stolen from by a thieving cunt. You are a little cunt yourself for suggesting that. You should really think about what you are saying before the words fly out of your sperm receptacle. I got phished for my account and did not use the same info on my Atlantis site sign up. Yet i got in the next day and saw they stole 2 dollars. Just goes to show you how ignorant the thieves were too. They could have waited 2 days and got me for 500 dollars. Luckily I learned my lesson on only 2 dollars. I changed all my information the next day to reclaim my account. Fuck Atlantis too. Even their real site can blow me. I&#039;m happy here.

Or how can someone protect themselves from this?&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this still happens, but people used to find this sight through the hidden wiki, which anyone can edit. So, they would be brought to a phishing sight that looked exactly like the normal one except the login screen would ask for your pin number to sign in. A lot of people got hacked that way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, make sure that your password is something complex and random. Something like Sdd6%as@dGy. Hackers use special programs that can determine a persons password: basically if your passphrase is a simple word that can be found in the dictionary, you are at a greater risk of getting hacked. <br /><br />Yes it is a pain in the ass to remember and keep track of but if you use different passwords for the various online services you use it decreases your chances of getting hacked. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Something REALLY helpful I found on these forums about making secure passwords is to do this.<br /><br />Take a small phrase that you&#039;ll never ever forget, something that&#039;s near and dear to you ... like The Sky Is Blue .. Except It&#039;s Not, It Looks Blue Because of Rayleigh Scattering<br /><br />And to make your password, for each letter type the key above it on your keyboard, so that stupidly long password would be 5y3wi68wgo73ll3sd30585wh95l85o99isgo73g3dq7w39r4q6o38tywdq55348hg&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If that made no sense to you lol, here i&#039;ll do it with silkroad&nbsp; &nbsp;it would be w8oi49qe&nbsp; &nbsp;... still don&#039;t get it?&nbsp; Then you&#039;re a retard, no .. lol here, the simple word the would be 5y3
