				So until last night I was oblivious to this side of the internet &amp; I have to admit I am absolutely amazed&nbsp; :P I&#039;ve searched around for other fun sites but haven&#039;t had much luck. I had an idea and I would like the opinion of an experienced user if it possible.. So I would like to set up some type of secret tor adult webcam site that can receive payment as bitcoins and have an account set up that can also be used to use for payment out of bitcoins, just an idea. I know I&#039;m going to have many people who criticize it but then again look where you are reading it..&nbsp; :-*

				It&#039;s not a terrible idea but there&#039;s already a lot of those on clearnet.<br /><br />clearnet - regular internet

				^^ Yea, its not illegal to do webcam stuff so you really could do it clearnet, but, we do need legitimate businesses/services to make bitcoins more legit, so by all means.... :D

				That is also true. A lot of people think bitcoins are really sketchy because most people know them to be only used for illegal things. We could more legal things to do with bitcoins.<br /><br />HighAllDay96

				Try out http://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonebitcoin for starters. There&#039;s no real reason why you wouldn&#039;t just do it on the clearnet.<br /><br />Also, why do I get the feeling you&#039;re just a guy that&#039;s going to run a video feed of some girls webcam video through a chatroom service?<br /><br />&#039;Littlemisslovely&#039; and using all those wacky smiley faces. Something about your post is just a little too close to the stereotype of a girl posting on the internet haha.

				... I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re asking.&nbsp; Do you want to indulge in exhibitionism without any chance whatsoever of being identified incase you run for president someday or something?&nbsp; Yeah, sure.&nbsp; Wear a mask and there you go, Tor&#039;s the way to make sure it can&#039;t ever come back to haunt you.<br /><br />Want to strip for drug money (not sure what else your second part about sending payments means)?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Either way, a hidden Tor service is basically safe.&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; They may figure out a way eventually, but today there&#039;s no evidence that they can find a hidden Tor service.&nbsp; That&#039;s what SR is.

				haha I promise you I am not a guy, and I don&#039;t think I actually have a stereotype, I was a cheerleader, a marine, has piercings, tattoos &amp; a 3.8 GPA and unfortuantely at the moment college student, single mom, unemployed and running out of options. Yes I could do this on clearnet, why is it called that? I like it&nbsp; ;) I will limit the smileys for your pleasure lol but if you think that&#039;s bad you should see my texts. Anyways, I have a lot of friends that have a high demand for a lot of the products sold on here and I need bitcoins to get what I need, and well, I&#039;m fun, cute and loveee the idea of sex for money but would never beable to bring myself to do it haa unless you count my ex but that&#039;s besides the fact. Webcam offers privacy but also gives me an option to do something that interests me, I&#039;ve never even made a sex tape but I like the idea of it being on here and not there, more exciting I guess.

				Omg SelfSov you basically got me dead on lol! I want to run for house next term since my birthday fell short of the deadline this year, I also think that this site could be used for a great underground political system. There is so much that needs to be changed &amp; yes I know I will have to get clean before I can do that, but the use of opiates helps greatly with my &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; I have suffered from all my life, I don&#039;t shot up, I don&#039;t use more than 3 pills a day if that and would prefer to just stop all together but it&#039;s hard to find suboxone and rehab isn&#039;t an option at the moment so I am doing what I need to do. I hate feeling like a fuck up for doing drugs but honestly the don&#039;t affect me in any negative way (except when I don&#039;t have them) if only they would use them to treat depression, it works great if you don&#039;t abuse it.

				Yeah, you sound like half of my girlfriends.&nbsp; That or a really good actor.&nbsp; Which I&#039;ve met before (oh God, don&#039;t ask... lol).<br /><br />Pervert spidey sense for the win?&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Well part of being a girlfriend is being an actor, adapt and overcome lol I&#039;m good at changing who I need to be to be comfortable or best fit to a situation, I&#039;ve moved to many different places and met many people so I&#039;ve gotten pretty good at it. Don&#039;t get me wrong I will always be me (which is prob. better than most of your girlfriends) just trying to figure out a way to get by without completely killing my soul, I don&#039;t want to have to look back at this time in my life and regret anything more than I already do, I&#039;ve never stolen money or anything and never would and unfortunately for me I had a great personality a nice body &amp; guys always want me but there&#039;s lines I wont cross soo I figured a webcam would be a better idea.
