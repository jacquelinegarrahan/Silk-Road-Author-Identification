				ok, background info for my question:&nbsp; &nbsp;Guys I have limited experience with Fleph, well,....technically 3-FMC which is not quite the same as Fleph. and plenty of experience with meth and coke.&nbsp; Prices in my neck of the woods IRL for coke and meth are around $50 a gram for coke, and $120 for meth(shards), most of the time purity obviously being compromised.<br /><br />I REALLY liked 3-FMC.&nbsp; &nbsp;Suffice it to say I have done my homework and purity and authenticity are not an issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to know two things:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who prefers 4-FMC to 3-FMC and <br /><br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp;If all you had were average bullshit coke and meth, would you prefer 3-FMC or Fleph of known purity?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp;would a street IRL price for fleph be worth a price point of $80 a gram given the above conditions if the fleph/3-FMC were pure?<br /><br />My experience with 3-FMC alone make me feel that I would rather pay a higher price for pure 3-FMC over cut meth or coke.&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason why I ask the question is because I know some that done care about the internet or research information and just want a good buzz for the money.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to try and fill that spot if it can be done.&nbsp; &nbsp;I did a gram of 3-FMC over the course of 16 hours and was up for a little over 48 and enjoyed it very much.&nbsp; &nbsp;To me it was a meth like stim, but with the euphoria of decent coke.&nbsp; It was a little harder on the body, but seemed to be a little more gentle on my my nerves.<br /><br />Just would like to know what people think.&nbsp; I have never tried Meph or 4-FMC, FYI.
