				Is the dope on SR better then your local Stamp bags where i live dope is widely available. and was just wondering the difference in potency.<br />I want to order some From MIMM&nbsp; .25mg of his stuff to .25mg street bag where i live. <br /><br /><br />I just have one question a street bag with about .25mg of dope in it cost about 4 dollars where i live.<br />So .25mg of some of MIMM dope is 100 usd shld it be insanely strong compared to a street bag or am i just wasting my time and money

				CrazyBart: there is probably a reason why his street stuff is $4, probably utter shit - But I could stand corrected depending if OP ever gets some from MiMM<br /><br />-MG

				the #3 H i get from dutch vendors on here is miles better than what I get locally, I live in a city in the UK that is well known for heroin use, it&#039;s basically smack central, but the quality is still not that good, it costs more on SR but is worth it. by the time it gets to the UK and to end users like me it&#039;s been stamped on so much you can barely get a decent nod of it. it still sells though because people use it more to stop withdrawals than get high off. I only use H a handful of times a year but I will use for like 2 weeks at a time when I do get some.
