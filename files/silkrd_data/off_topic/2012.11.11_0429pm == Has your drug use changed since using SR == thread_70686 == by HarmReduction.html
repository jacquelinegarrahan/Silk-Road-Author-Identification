				Ehe <br /><br />Since I&#039;ve been in the know about The Road I&#039;ve been using it for almost all my drugs. The only thing I don&#039;t order from SR is weed and hash, since where I live it&#039;s really affordable and the quality is top notch :D <br /><br />But hey, what a drug lover does when he encounters The Road aha! Can&#039;t say I really tried anything new, but I&#039;m happy I can actually do my window shopper and take the best quality available. Sure it&#039;s pricey, but you get what you paid for! I&#039;ve had a very pure batch of MDMA, and did get some real LSD (at last!). <br /><br />SilkRoad...it&#039;s the future!

				I have not tried any new drugs since joining SR, I don&#039;t really do anything apart from smoke weed these days, my days of drug fueled parties are done. I&#039;ve never even bought any weed from SR in my year+ of being here though, i occasionally browse and have made a few inquiries but have yet to take the plunge and make a purchase.

				When I joined SR, I was just looking to find some good LSD...where I live its VERY hard for a guy who is almost 40 to find some.&nbsp; Silk Road introduced me to Molly and damn if my life and many of the people&#039;s lives around me haven&#039;t changed forever!

				Hasn&#039;t changed for me much. <br /><br />I wonder if anyone here was a &#039;drug virgin&#039; until they found Silk Road, and their first experience was from something they bought here?<br />There must be a few people like that, I&#039;d be interested to know. :)

				Yeah it&#039;s let me be more of an arse hole to people at social gatherings by allowing them to have 1 line of coke which is enough to make them think theirs is shit but I don&#039;t let them have any more after that. :) <br /><br />Shit-to-have-shit-blow.co.uk

				Since being on SR. I&#039;ve finally gotten my hands on good, clean, LSD. It&#039;s rather sketchy buying tabs off street because most times you don&#039;t even know what&#039;s on your blotter.&nbsp;

				Great feedback thanks ....Do people have to plan ahead their use as they are having to wait for the package (Drug &gt;set&gt;setting), is buying from here making drug use safer and reducing the impulsiveness as alot of people report that street buying can be impulsive

				Because of SR I have experimented with a couple more drugs (2C-B, MDMA, amphetamine sulphate, 25i-NBOMe). Because I have such easy access to any drug that I want, I really haven&#039;t done much more than research them all! I&#039;ve also found that I&#039;m really not into a lot of drugs, and that I&#039;m slowly starting to lose interest in drugs, their illegality made them sort of &#039;cool&#039;, but now that I can get them so easily I don&#039;t think much of it. <br /><br />And also, because of SR I have begun to sell MDMA to my friends at inflated prices, but they&#039;re not complaining ;)

				Use hasn&#039;t changed too much yet. Saving lots of money on things that are much more expensive locally, using that cash to get novel substances that interest me so I guess you could say I&#039;ve turned into more of a collector!
