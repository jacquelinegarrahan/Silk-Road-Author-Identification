				How will they enforce this? Will the police go into coffee shops and randomly card people to see if they are members? How easy is it to distinguish foreigners of European descent from the native Dutch just by looking at them? How are the gangs making money if the weed is legal? <br /><br />A couple of the provisions I agree with like not selling pot to minors or next to a school. Eventually they&#039;ll be coming to California for the Cannabis Cup.

I doubt the customers will be prosecuted (maybe their purchase will be confiscated), but I think the coffeeshop owner will be fined.<br /><br />The law is not effective yet, it will probably be in 2012 (but has already been postponed once).<br /><br />In (at most) two years there will be new elections. Let&#039;s hope some more sane parties will win them.<br />

				....not everyone sits and smokes in a coffee-shop in nl, the workaround is to simply ask for a &#039;take-away&#039;, or your dutch mate buys it for you....seems like a stupid clamp<br />down that won&#039;t achieve much certainly won&#039;t earn them any tax as you&#039;d probably have to buy the rest from dealers which is the illegal side of things...stupid laws..<br /><br />tut tut tut<br />&nbsp;&gt;:(<br />
