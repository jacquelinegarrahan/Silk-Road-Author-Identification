				I really like the idea of this site, however I just cant get over how sketchball this seems. I am also a bit confused about the bitcoin process,&nbsp; but I get the gist of it. What if I dont have another address to have a shipment go to? Damn, only if my guy sold good shit, I wouldnt have to even think about going down this road. Any tips for a newbie?

				Man all I can tell you is it works fine for most everyone that uses it, so far. If you keep finding yourself coming back to the idea, then you&#039;ll try it eventually.<br />As far as BTC, if you still need to know more, watch a tutorial till you understand it all.<br />I&#039;m still a noob technically, but I&#039;ve got far enough to feel safe with it all.

Look into the laws of first class and priority mail and keep looking around these forums and eventually you&#039;ll become more comfortable with the idea. Beyond that start messaging some sellers about their products and become more familiar with the community.&nbsp; 8)

				Always err on the side of caution. Don&#039;t do anything you normally wouldn&#039;t do, in regards to ordering and such. I wouldn&#039;t suggest ordering kilograms of coke on a regular basis, but who am I to tell you what to do. <br /><br />I was pretty hesitant at first as well, but it&#039;s all good now. Just don&#039;t let your guard down. It may feel like you&#039;re in a candy store (because you are), but don&#039;t let it take over.<br /><br />sdesu

				It did seem a tad odd at first, but after 3 successful transactions I am happy. You can always review the sellers feedback to see what his shipping is like if you are still nervous.

				I&#039;ve had plenty of packages comes through with no trouble whatsoever, a few times 3-5 in one day. As long as you stay security conscious you&#039;ll be good.
