				I love just about all music and it always goes in phases. Last 2 years it&#039;s been mostly dubstep, hardcore, triphop, and lot&#039;s of shit like SCI and STS9. Molly&#039;s been good lately so I think that has something to do with it.

				Have been into dubstep for about 4 - 5 years now. Started with stuff from the UK. But like with any music I like to do my research and find its roots, its spin offs and everything in-between. So I went back to reggae roots. Explored some of the fat dub lines these artists were producing. <br /><br />Should look up King Tubby. Roots Manuva. <br /><br />Then just sort of sat there for a while, and then Skrillex exploded onto the scene and everyone listens to dubstep now. <br /><br />Haven&#039;t been up to date for w while, but I definitely still listen to my roots and experimental stuff. <br /><br />Would love to get some artist names from this thread.

				OP change the thread title so we can have a general Electronica discussion! (which I was actually thinking of starting the other day) - rather than just Dubstep.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I had my main Dubstep phase about 3 years ago. I still like it, but mainly just at raves/festivals where I can get drunk or take other drugs and have a good ol&#039; time skanking. But it&#039;s not something I can sit down and listen to 24/7 anymore; not the proper brostep anyway. The &quot;filthiness&quot; just starts to get old. I can appreciate the production, but music-wise it just starts to get a bit stale. Never listening to it at home though only makes it more enjoyable at festivals, where the filthiness seems fresh again.<br /><br />But in terms of Electronica, Drum &amp; Bass and House is where it&#039;s at for me right now.<br />Neurofunk, Liquid, Jump Up DnB, and Progressive House, Hard House/Hardstyle.<br />I&#039;ve also started getting into Trap music, after seeing Baauer the other week.<br /><br />There are too many good producers to list all of them... but I&#039;ve at least got to mention the mighty Noisia!
