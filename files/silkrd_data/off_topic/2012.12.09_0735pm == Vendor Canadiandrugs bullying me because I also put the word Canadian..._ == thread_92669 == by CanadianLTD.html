Also, just assume that anyone who would send the kind of pm you received is kind of a wacko. I&#039;m sure there are plenty of similar vendor names currently in use, and I can think of a few that are a closer match then yours and this guy&#039;s.<br /><br />So no need to worry about this guy, but my humble suggestion would be to establish a consistent forum presence that will distinguish you from this other vendor and how he behaves on the forums. That way the buyers (the only people who matter to a vendor&#039;s success), will be better able to distinguish you as somebody reliable who they want to do business with. Either way welcome to the road, and pay no mind to the trolls.&nbsp; :)

				I could be wrong but the impression I am getting based on the OP and little info I gathered from it is that you are two silkroad users with the exact same screen name, I did not notice any differences based on what you have up at the moment.<br /><br />I dont think he is saying that he owns the name canadiandrugs but that he/she is concerned that you both have the same screen name bc it can cause confusion in the forums as to who is who and one of the two people could get their reputation hurt bc of this confusion and as a vendor you don&#039;t want issues like this.<br /><br />That is my two cents.

				I think he&#039;s on to something! Im going to message support and let them know I dont agree with other vendors selling the same product as me :)<br /><br />lol on a more serious note. Just looking from the business side of things it probably is going to cause confusion with the many of members who only take a glance at most stuff. Also, wouldnt it be a tad bit better to have an unique name that doesnt resemble anyone else&#039;s anyways? Just my thoughts.

				Canada is a fucking battleground.&nbsp; There aren&#039;t many domestic customers to fight over so it gets fierce.&nbsp; I notice new vendors are bullied by others.&nbsp; Mostly other vendors using fake accounts to give bad karma and shoot down their posts and such. <br /><br />There is a whole world of buyers who never come to the forums never.&nbsp; They have no idea what drama is going on.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, people shouldn&#039;t get too hung up in these forums.&nbsp; They are here for customer support.

Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters, to suppress numbers, files and websites. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored across the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.[1][2]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				At one time there were a couple of OneStops with very minor differences in how they spelled them. I think a lot of buyers just become fans of their vendors and that solves that problem. I don&#039;t think too many buyers go on and search by name to find their vendor that often so I find it unlikely you&#039;ll accidentally steal his business&nbsp; :) Just hope he doesn&#039;t go bad and that can hurt your rep to those who don&#039;t check their facts and see you&#039;re different. That happened to some extent in the onestop situation if I remember right.
