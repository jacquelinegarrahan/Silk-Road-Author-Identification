				Hello all,<br /><br />I&#039;ll get right to it. I&#039;m yearning for this life-changing experience from a drug that I hear that so many have. Sure, I&#039;ve had life-changing effects from the use of drugs such as Adderall and Ecstasy. Yet, I&#039;m searching for more of the &quot;opening&quot; that I expected from Psychedelics. I have tried LSD locally and from the Silk Road (envious, a very reputable vendor). I most I took was 5 tabs (500ug) of envious acid at an amusement park. This was the first time I feel I actually had &#039;experienced&#039; LSD. Other times were disappointing. At this dose I seen fractals and small things such as wood turning to shapes. It was only very light and I still wasn&#039;t impressed. At once point I turned around to a guy while at the end of a roller coaster: He was laughing and I turned around to see his face/mouth+teeth/ears were very.. surreal. Not cartoonish, but almost dreamlike and scaled differently. No CEV, Colors appear the same. The most MDMA I have taken is 250mg on no tolerance. No change in colors/perception. I&#039;m feeling as if my sense of perception cannot be flawed.<br /><br />I honestly want that &quot;in another dimension&quot; trip. I want something that will astonish me. It seems that if DMT isn&#039;t the option, that only leaves dangerous deliriants&nbsp; [DPH for example]. <br /><br />How much DMT should I try to &quot;breakthrough&quot; with and how should I do so? Although a high dose, I&#039;m thinking around 75mg of DMT. (Granted, my first LSD dose was 300ug and I have good self control)<br />Meth pipe work best?<br /><br />I figure my procedure to do this will be with a trip setter. I will have an empty stomach and be completely calm. Breathe in and out slowly a few times. Then let all of the air out of my lungs until I need to get air. When this happens I will take a large hit of DMT (assuring that I have lungs full of the substance) and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat as many times as possible (5 max?).<br /><br />Let me know any suggestions you have for me.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />:)

				delirients are just no good, avoid them. you should try ketamine or dmt but i must first caution you: they may make you question reality but you must remember its all in your head and bullshit created by the drug, not god or the meaning of life

				Sabteria is very uninformed.&nbsp; DMT is not &quot;bullshit&quot;.&nbsp; Also, when you say &quot;its all in your head&quot;, well shit wtf does that really mean?&nbsp; Sure when I take DMT everything I see and learn is happening inside my head but calling that bullshit is extremely cowardice and an easy way to accept the reality around you.<br /><br />Id love to answer as many questions as I can for the OP about DMT but words can really only say so much.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of my experiences with Changa (DMT infused herbs) have been beautiful and eye opening but not life changing in the fact that I talk to a goddess who tells me how to change my life.&nbsp; Changa is more an experience of connecting with what I like to call Mother Earth and just learning to spread happiness and love everywhere.<br /><br />My experiences with Pharmahuasca have been way different and I still havent managed to have a trip where I fully understand ANYTHING.... however I have learned a lot about my relationships with other people and how I go about living my life... one way to describe it would be to say it has completely rewired my brain (in an amazing and beautiful way).<br /><br />Hopefully some of this information can help :)<br /><br />

				I think the point they were making is that you should not ignore this reality because of realizations you made in another reality. You may come to an understanding that the DMT world is what exists after death. It&#039;s still important not to test that out with one last DMT triple-hit and 10 seconds of freefall from a tall bridge.<br /><br />I&#039;m as interested in metaphysics as any other lay philosopher, but I don&#039;t think there is an answer to my questions in substances or logic. I think the questions are beautiful without the answers. Where did all of this reality come from? I don&#039;t believe in a &quot;god&quot; in the way that the Jews, Christians, or Muslims do. I don&#039;t believe in personal enlightenment in the way many eastern religions do. I don&#039;t believe anyone will ever really understand this reality. It&#039;s a question that people have taken short cuts with for thousands of years. No substance, no matter how hyped by Joe Rogan and others, will bring me enlightenment.<br /><br />None of this is to say that it&#039;s not worth trying, provided there are no ramifications to the substances. I&#039;m not interested in ruining what I have &quot;here&quot; (my body or mind) in order to explore questions that I&#039;m certain can not be provably answered.<br />

				Psychedelic fans should really stop going on about how these substances can change your life or solve your problems for you.....<br /><br />For those with a &quot;spiritual inclination&quot; maybe these experiences are easier to get, but I have never had a single one. Have maybe used a couple grams of DMT in the last few years, mescaline twice, shrooms maybe 5 or 6 times. Through my teenage years I really psyched myself up reading about trips and the beautiful realizations that accompany them and when I finally tried them boy was I disappointed! Nothing but confusion with shrooms, mescaline was enjoyable only because it was stimulating and to me felt remarkably like MDMA and DMT is insane. I very much enjoy DMT but what the hell can you learn? It&#039;s an incredible rollercoaster ride but come on.....<br />Shrooms are the worst. Your buddies sit there with stupid grins talking bullshit that they are convinced is deep and spiritual. I feel that it completely turns my brain off....... I have more life realizations while sober for sure<br /><br />The only way to gain real appreciation for reality and life in my opinion is plenty of sobreity and in depth study of sciences and social sciences..... <br /><br />Though I am a physics/mathematics student so I guess I am slightly biased&nbsp; :o

				500ug of LSD and that&#039;s all it got you? Seems like you must have a high natural tolerance (or bunk acid.)<br /><br />Now, what are you asking &quot;Is DMT the answer?&quot; to? Is DMT going to solve your problems? Probably not. Could DMT open you up and allow you to experience a very vivid trip? Yes.

				Just because psychedelics havent changed your life for the better doesn&#039;t mean they havent greatly enhanced other peoples lives.&nbsp; The realizations I have come to while on intense DMT/Ayahuasca/and even Nbome trips have caused me to be way happier as a person... I could go farther in depth but its very naive to say psychedelics don&#039;t &quot;work for people&quot;... just as it would be naive of me to say psychedelics WOULD work for all people... to each their own :)&nbsp;

				Good point. In fact nearly all of my friends swear by using them and they are mostly happy balanced people! <br /><br />What I wanted to get across is that these religious experiences aren&#039;t guaranteed in anyway.... I was kind of lead to believe that and was left feeling sorely disappointed! <br /><br />One day I will try some pharmahuasca and maybe that will change my mind&nbsp; ;D

Later... Load 20-30mg, smoke. Go upwards by 5mg for subsequent doses, if necessary.<br /><br />Dose will vary, but 75mg is far too high for an initial go at DMT. The &#039;standard&#039; breakthrough range is usually from 20mg to 40mg. This is best achieved through a vaporizer, but a meth pipe will work. Look into &quot;The DMT Machine&quot; it is very simple to make and works well. <br /><br />Smoking technique is everything with DMT so it may not work perfectly on round 1. It helps to load the DMT evenly instead of one big pile and to apply heat (not too much) evenly.<br />Also, for my first time I smoked a small (5-10mg) dose to get my bearings with the substance before loading a breakthrough dose.<br /><br />Anything above 50mg is probably wasting some DMT, likely by overheating.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28130.msg308067#msg308067">Quote from: eve on June 25, 2012, 11:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I figure my procedure to do this will be with a trip setter.

I&#039;ve heard some say hold for 10 seconds so you have enough time for 3 hits before you reach 30 seconds, but that&#039;s just too hectic for me. At 15 seconds I have no doubt that the DMT is still being absorbed, it can be felt. The energy continues to rise to my head as I count to 14... 15... 16, I breathe out when I feel the energy settle down into me. <br /><br />By the second or third big hit I can barely understand how to work the pipe/vape (bongs I can do still), but if I&#039;m not being sucked into hyperspace at that point I make sure to hit it once more. <br /><br />Also, lay on the floor or bed with some pillows/blankets. Anywhere you can comfortably lean/lay/fall back comfortably.<br /><br />If you will be partaking outdoors I would recommend a day-time trip. In my experiences with DMT, being with nature definitely brings a deeper level to it. I&#039;m not sure if it affects the hyperspace journey (can&#039;t make enough sense of it), but nature mixes nicely with OEVs and, for me, promotes thoughts about the world. <br /><br /><br />As some others have pointed out, you are not guaranteed a &#039;spiritual&#039; trip. Some trips can be immediately life-changing while others will only change your life if you allow it. You can choose to ignore or simply move on from what you have seen and experienced or you can take time to integrate the experience and apply it to your life. I will say this much, DMT has changed my life and for the better. From my first breakthrough I could tell it was something special and, for me, it has proven that time and time again.

				dmt is always the answer! but seriously, if you want that &quot;in another dimension&quot; trip, dmt will surely take you there. i haven&#039;t tried using a meth pipe yet. my only breakthrough trip (so far) came from smoking it out of a bong on top of weed.

				a good hit of salvia divinorum extract will deliver to you what you seek....<br />beware, though, Sally dishes out huge helpings of tough love to her children.&nbsp; Her domain is Earth and you can learn all the secrets of life through her; it enables one to reconnect with nature and evolution.<br />you will never see life the same after a respectful and honest salvia breakthrough.<br /><br />DMT is much more alien of a realm with much more potential for exploration, but salvia give you le force; it arms you with memories of your past/origin and the power to overcome great fear and discomfort.&nbsp; For example, She might send you to hell just to teach you how to get yourself out of it...or she might show you what its like to be stuck in time so you can appreciate the way you move through it so fluidly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think salvia has the potential to bring negative forces/demons/djinn into your world, but DMT most certainly has that potential.&nbsp; that is why i recommend people gain the blessing of the Goddess before venturing into the unknown world of DMT<br /><br />if you&#039;ve ever had an inclination towards or affinity for witchcraft or the old goddess religions, you should really do salvia.&nbsp; again, its tough love, but magicians become great by embarking on such harrowing and treacherous quests.

				@Space wasp: its odd that you feel that way about DMT and salvia, as I have always found salvia to much more alien feeling with a certain confusion that is reminiscent of Nitrous. and DMT always felt more friendly.<br /><br />If the OP is really looking for a complete balls to the wall interdimensional trip.

				DMT taught me how to somewhat keep my cool while my mind was exploding inside my head. It has also increased my wonder and curiosity in the world around me. I find myself thinking about hyperspace often and coming up with my own theories. I don&#039;t think it would be incorrect to say that DMT opens up a new level of thought.<br /><br />For overall life improvement though, I would have to say that cannabis has taught me the most about myself and unmasked some negative thought patterns that I was able to change and now my life is better for it. Not always fun, but a great teacher.

Lots of people have problems that are generally caused by others. Sure it&#039;s my fault that I haven&#039;t ended relationships with problematic friends. Sure that&#039;s my fault. Is the random crazy bullshit I have to occasionally endure because most people I know aren&#039;t as fucking sane, calm, and thoughtful as I am? I don&#039;t think so. It&#039;s bullshit that I accept in order to have relationships with certain people.<br /><br />Since my last post in this thread, I&#039;ve tried DMT. Holy shit is clearly the right phrase. Salvia is nothing like DMT for me. Salvia gave me some impressive experiences, but I came out of them thinking &quot;wow&quot;, not &quot;wow that&#039;s real!&quot;<br /><br />Salvia didn&#039;t make me question reality. DMT makes me believe there may actually be an afterlife! :)<br /><br />Unlike the uber-pr0z at dmt-nexus.me, I recommend everyone try DMT. Do it right. Do it sober. Treat it with respect. But yes, I think we should all smoke DMT and join joe rogan&#039;s cult. Motherfucker.

				MXE provided one of these experiences for me, and it has indeed been life changing. If you want that experience, you must try MXE. It&#039;s like Ket; but stronger!<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken it at parties where everybody took it and you get some interesting experiences. Me and my best mate morphed into the same person and were able to talk telepathically to each other... whether this actually happened is to be debated. But all in all, definately something worth checking out.

				I&#039;ve done acid, mescaline, mushrooms, and DMT. I never went looking for &#039;answers&#039;, just experience. If you&#039;re looking for something to put you over the edge and &#039;open your mind&#039; maybe you need to start with your own life. I don&#039;t mean this disrespectfully at all. I have a habit of examining my own life and how I interact with others. Most of those people don&#039;t even know that I am a &#039;drug user&#039;. I take in life, I process events, relationships, and information. THEN I &#039;trip&#039;. Without sounding like a therapist or psychologist I have found for myself that the most revelatory &#039;experiences&#039; come from understanding life events. The &#039;trips&#039; are a release and freeing of my mind FROM my body. <br /><br />Anyway just saw the post and threw in my opinion. Take it or leave it.

				My roommate and I have been dashing home from work every day to check the mailbox for our goodies. I personally plan to do a small amount of meditation on why certain aspects of my psyche are like they are, but we both mostly want to go to hyperspace and see the machine elves<br /><br />so hype!

				DMT is definitely in a league of its own - except for maybe high doses of mushrooms. Everytime I have a breakthrough tryp I&#039;m so astonished and so thankful to be able to have such an experience that I&#039;m nearly reduced to tears. It&#039;s extremely difficult to justify the illegality of this substance.&nbsp;
