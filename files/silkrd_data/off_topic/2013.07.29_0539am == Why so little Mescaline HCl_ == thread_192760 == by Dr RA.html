				I am uninformed on this but very curious. I remember quite some time ago I found extraction teks which implied making reasonable pure mescaline hcl would not be that difficult. Perhaps this was wrong, but it seems to me if its true, given the prevalence of mescaline cacti, there should be at least some of this stuff for sale?<br /><br />I realize that it takes an extremely long time to cultivate these cactus, but it seems amazing nobody is filling this niche in the market. I&#039;ve only seen a few listing for it, and they all seem to have been overpriced. <br /><br />Are there efficient alternate routes to mescaline production, i.e. synthesis? It would be nice if some talented chemist could fill this gap in the market.

				Agreed, I&#039;d like to see more on the road.&nbsp; I was under the impression it&#039;s not that straightforward to synthesize, especially when extraction takes so little effort (but of course has downsides like taste and quantity)

				i have a friend that is growing like 10 of them, but they only like year 6 or 7.. I did alil searching but didn&#039;t come up with any 10+ year cacti. Any clue where to get them, if even possible? Me&nbsp; and my buddy just ran a few oz of DMT and been looking into some other synthesis we can do.

				The present mescaline listing seems to me like it is only about two trips worth of material for $80? This seems really expensive to me. I understand how rare it is, but still. The margins on this must be ridiculous, or the process difficult.<br /><br />I have never personally done mescaline hcl. I have heard you need at least 450-500mg to get a full experience. Can anyone comment on this?

				Because it is expensive to buy big amounts of cacti and the final yield is not to big because of the need to take 300mg + doses<br /><br />You&#039;re better off buying powdered san pedro, bridgesii ect. and doing your own extraction. That&#039;s what i&#039;ve always done and just hooked up friends with a beautiful trip.<br /><br />I guess someone outside the US could have an easier way to make it but there isnt much of a demand
