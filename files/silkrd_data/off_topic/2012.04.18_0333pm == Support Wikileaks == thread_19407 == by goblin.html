				Hello, fellow vendors and buyers of a freedom-loving mind. Just a short note to ask that you support Wikileaks in its continuing fight for openness and freedom by donating bitcoins to them. As you know they have been blocked by the banking industry, PayPal and Amazon due to the increasingly heavy-handed tactics of theObama proto-fascist regime.<br /><br />Help keep the light of liberty burning as democracy and freedom are dead otherwise.<br /><br />Go to: http://shop.wikileaks.org/donate#dbitcoin<br /><br />goblin

I speak of when we first issued money not backed by gold. That led to the slow depreciation of our currency and eventually the establishment of the Federal Reserve; we all know what happened after that... Steady inflation, stock market crashes, world wars. God fucking damn it I hate the rich.
