				Today I was in need of some drug paraphernalia so I decided to head to the nearest Head Shop. Its in a not so nice part of town, when I was younger Id go to that area and score drugs in a shady, did I say shady sort of way<br /><br />Anyways, I give the girl behind the counter, did I mention that this girl had a gnarly scab on her forhead, I give her 20 bucks for a 3 dolla item.&nbsp; 2 dollars change she gives me without batting an eye<br /><br />Um excuse me, give me my change, she grudgingly goes back into the register and digs out my change.<br /><br />All the while some scumy dude customer pressing up behind me, in line, asks her something stupid, I leave, he leaves<br /><br />&quot;Hey man, whats you got for sale in the market&quot; he says with a missing tooth greesy rip you off junky smile<br />&quot;Im looking for some crystal&quot;<br /><br />I say, &quot;Im just selling jewelry&quot; and walk off<br /><br />So glad I dont have to go through that world anymore to get to what I want, the people who will rip you off, the beaten up stepped on scum<br /><br />Thanx to the goodness of SilkRoad

				This is extremely well said.&nbsp; The next major transformation of Silk Road will occur when middle aged people discover it.&nbsp; Face it, nobody realizes on day that the stuff that they have enjoyed for years suddenly sucks.&nbsp; No, you wake up one day, suddenly old, and lack the access to young people who have access to what you want.&nbsp; Silk Road is fucking paradise, amd I don&#039;t care what the prices are, it keeps me from having to go to &quot;that part of town&quot;

				Yeah here the headshops are for middle to upper class white college kids with money.&nbsp; I would expect that the shop described here doesn&#039;t sell $400 Roor bongs and Volcanoes.

				Biscuit I like your post and your story!! I had totally different problems before SR though.<br /><br />My problem is that 1) I live in the suburbs, 2) I don&#039;t have any friends&nbsp; :&#039;(.....&nbsp; 3) I have social phobia. 4) I&#039;m a closet junkie with no drugs and I hadn&#039;t had any of the hardcore drugs in 5 years. <br /><br />Then I found SR and thanks to SR, I have properly medicated myself with xanax. Now I am able to approach co-workers with a smile and ask them, &quot;HEY man, YOU DO DRUGS? YOU know anyone that sells METH??? HEROIN dawg? you like HEROIN?&quot;. They think I&#039;m joking - but i study their reactions to my question, hoping to find a closet junkie like me. Someone who has a stable life but secretly wants drugs ALL the TIME (and being responsible about it). But I ended up telling my &quot;joke&quot; to too many people... and no one gave me that suspicious grin I was looking for (that guilty, &quot;IM ON DRUGS RIGHT NOW, but you can&#039;t tell hhaha&quot; grin)<br /><br />I&#039;m alone with my drugs. I&#039;m happy but I still needed a drug buddy. I still had hope. <br /><br />The guy next door is always asking me, &quot;yo when are we gonna hit up the weed?&quot; So last weekend I was like, &quot;ok here&#039;s the plan, we&#039;re giong to listen to music, smoke some weed, drink some vodka, freebase a couple ritalins, pop a xanax, then the main event&#039;s gonna be CRACK COCAINE!!&quot; He looks at me in horror like I had just confessed to some heinous crime??? what?? <br /><br />&quot;nah, I&#039;m good with just the weed&quot;<br /><br />How dare him! If someone had offered me a banquet of illegal DRUGS I would have been like, &quot;Leeeeeeeeeeeet&#039;s get readyyyy to RUuuuuuuumbleeeeeeeeee&quot;. <br /><br />so now my problems are 1) I live in the suburbs, 2) I don&#039;t have any friends that want to do tons of drugs&nbsp; :&#039;( 3) everyone knows that I do drugs now&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />on a positive note, at least Silk Road solved one of my problems. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, that&#039;s the shitty part of getting older.<br />I still have a few core friends that I can hang with, without looking like a bunch of hippies.<br />We&#039;re closet hippies, hidden within your perfect society...<br />MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!<br /><br />Seriously though.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to make new friends when you&#039;re worried about their affiliations.&nbsp; I&#039;m a father, and I know another father who moved here a couple years back.&nbsp; I KNOW he wants to be friends with me, but because of his job, and the fact that he&#039;s 10 years older than me, it makes me leery.<br /><br />Is he going to freak out and tell all the neighbors I&#039;m a pothead?<br />Will he tell my employers?<br />It&#039;s safer for me to walk by his house and wave on occasion, and avoid him whenever possible.<br />That&#039;s the sad fact of prohibition... it&#039;s not drugs that make us antisocial, it&#039;s the fucking FEAR.<br />Damned LE cracking down on weirdos making obscene hand gestures at lamposts and such.<br />Let us trip balls in peace.
