				Well, I used to be able to say that I never had a bad trip on DMT. Looks like I cant say that anymore.<br /><br />I had taken MDMA the night before and the morning after taking it I figured that I would try for a DMT breakthrough. First I tried 50mg, got a nice body buzz and when I went to lay down, I got no visuals at all. Usually I can breakthrough off of 40-45 if I&#039;m ready, so this was strange. After 15 minutes I got up and packed another hit of about 55-60mg. Same thing, body high and this time I got some extremely mild fractals and colorful lines appearing (Not full blown pictures. colors and life-forms appearing).<br /><br />I was annoyed and wanted to breakthrough bad. Before packing my third hit I wondered if this was a good idea at all, I began to think I might have a bad trip or I might be wasting even more DMT, but I did it anyways.<br /><br />Once I finished inhaling the third 60mg hit, I had a very strange body high wash over me. It felt like a normal DMT buzz but a little different, it felt like it wasn&#039;t supposed to be that way. I crashed on my bed and instead of having lots of colors appearing, my vision went entirely black and lots of dark red lines shot around. I was instantly hit with a wave of anxiety which I had never felt before on DMT, all I could think was &quot;Oh fuck, please no, please no&quot;. A red goop (which looked like blood) started flowing down the black nothingness that I was seeing, and I forced myself to open my eyes so I didn&#039;t see anything.<br /><br />I spent about 10 minutes lying on my bed waiting for the effects to go away, every time I closed my eyes I felt anxious and saw red and black everywhere. This happened about two weeks ago and I haven&#039;t done DMT since, it scared the shit out of me. Before that I had done DMT around 30 times and loved every single experience. I know that I shouldn&#039;t have kept taking it, BIG mistake and I definitely wont do that again. I have a feeling I couldn&#039;t breakthrough because of the MDMA the day before, something to do with the receptors or something.<br /><br />I made this to warn people to go easy on the DMT, if you are even remotely worried about having a bad trip then don&#039;t do it. You set yourself up for a disaster.<br /><br />Im going to try again in about an hour and see if everything goes smoothly. I really love DMT so I hope it was just one rouge experience.

				Sorry to hear you had a bad time.<br /><br />In future, listen to your intuition my friend. Also you were very probably exhausted on many levels after the mdma, which imo is entirely the wrong condition to be in for a dmt experience.<br /><br />You can&#039;t fuck around with dmt, as you are now very aware of! Hopefully your tale will help others to avoid the same experience

				Woah! Dont let this experience turn you off DMT. <br /><br />DMT is by far my most favorite drug on the planet, I remember one sunny afternoon I smoked it in my room with a cool breeze flowing through the room. As soon as I broke through I saw the most vivid and extraordinary colors ever, and all I could think of was how much I enjoy life at that very moment in time and how beautiful everything is. I had done DMT over thirty times before having my first bad trip (this one), and it was because of my own ignorance that it even happened in the first place. I smoked over 200mg of DMT in under 20 minutes, where-as you would probably do 50mg and be good to not do it again for over an hour :P<br /><br />@Slirp - No I didn&#039;t really feel like I was going to die. The minute I saw all the red appearing and the anxiety hit I IMMEDIATELY thought (Fuck, so this is what a bad trip is like). I was perfectly aware that I was having a bad trip as a result of the DMT and knew that in a few minutes I would be perfectly normal again. The only crappy part was the body high was NOT enjoyable anymore, I felt sick to my stomach and anxious along with seeing disturbing hallucinations every time I closed my eyes. The anxiety was more towards the fact that it even happened, I was upset that it was my first experience like that as I had hoped to never have a bad DMT trip.<br /><br />Funny enough, after about 10 minutes when the visuals started to subside, I actually laughed at how stupid the situation was and how I could be so naive to think I could get away with that much DMT in such a short time. All that stuff about people saying to not &quot;disappoint the elf spirits&quot;, is absolutely right.<br /><br />If you piss them off, they&#039;ll fuck with your head. Don&#039;t abuse the spice<br /><br />and uhhh... don&#039;t try to breakthrough the day after partying on MDMA.

				It&#039;s the MDMA. it drops your serotonin levels to zero for a while. Aside from that I find the relation between serotonin and DMT substance quite interesting. They seem to work together and have similar properties. Gotta read up more on that! But I guess we shouldn&#039;t take something that depletes serotonin before a DMT trip. :P<br /><br />I just received my DMT, but I&#039;m still scared to take it. (first time) Mainly afraid that I will burn it or cough it up before inhaling everything resulting in a wasted try. :P<br /><br />I&#039;m on crystal meth at the moment, so I don&#039;t think I will do it in a few days. Does anyone know if DMT depletes your serotonin at all? I&#039;ll probably read up on that as well.<br /><br />Glad you are ok. Good luck to you and everyone else. :)

Since nobody else (apart Christ, but he is not an historical character and even if he would be, his story surely could not proven) have died then resurrected to tell us what it really happens when you COMPLETELY die, nobody can know if it exist an &quot;hell&quot; or not, if there&#039;s a life after death or not and similar things.<br /><br />People can make hypothesis on their experiences, and the experience nearer to death is a NDE, but it is anyway NOT the same thing, neither remotely, so basing certainty on what it happens after death based on experiences made during life is nonsense.<br /><br />What you are calling &quot;Hell&quot; is an inappropriate use of the term for the state you want to explain. Hell is a place (or state of being, depending on different theological point of views) that is described in the bible (the most know reference, but also in other mythologies, as the Greek one, i.e. Hades etc.) the state you talk about can either exist but it is not &quot;Hell&quot;, you have called it such (probably to better convey the feelings etc.), but in so doing you have attributed to it a definite context (primarily mythological) that turns what you say (that you have experienced it) in nonsense and it turns every mention of that state in something well defined (so you have to take this in consideration).

I think that if you like both you have to decide or one or the other because it&#039;s very difficult to have the two to go fine together:&nbsp; the inhibition of TPH by MDMA is permanent, so the body must compensate by creating more and this restoration typically takes 1-3 months. So if you like MDMA you are usually waiting that time to roll again, hence renewing again the process and this naturally doesn&#039;t cope well with use of DMT.

				I have also had a bad trip my third time on DMT well i consider it bad compared to my other experiences with it anyway... the first time i broke through was one of the most amazing joyful experiences i have had in my life the only thing that really beats it is falling in love with someone and them loving you back okay so anyway the first time i set up schpongle - dmt to listen to on youtube and i had never heard the song before but had seen it in the youtube list when i was looking up dmt previously so i decided to save it for when i actually had my first dmt experience.<br /><br />I pressed play on the song then used the sandwich method in a bong pulled it slowly and held it in as long as i could then i lay back on my bed and almost instantly i had a wave rush over me and patterns became to form all over my room i then closed my eyes and was in some kind of what i call circus world everything seemed to have a blue tint and i remember jack in the box type things with clown heads popping out of them this might sound a little bit weird or creepy to some but at the time i found it very enjoyable because i knew that it had worked next thing i knew i started hearing a voice and it was saying &quot;welcome you made it we have been waiting for you&quot; &quot;you are special we are so happy you are here you have been chosen for this&quot; pretty much at the same i was hearing this voice say extremely nice and comforting things to me i was being bombarded with images at an incredible speed it literally seemed like millions of images in a matter of seconds all sorts of things like landscapes, pyramids, mathematical equations, animals, flowers, people and many more things that i cant remember it was really quite incredible it was at this point that the compliments the voice was giving me about being special and being chosen made me feel like i was letting my ego get the best of me and then the voice said &quot;everyone is special&quot; &quot;you are everything and everything is you&quot; &quot;you are you mother your father your brother your friends your enemies&quot; this made me feel better and realise that i shouldnt let my ego control me i am special but so is everyone else for we are all connected and though we are many we are really just one.<br /><br />The whole time this was going on the schpongle - dmt song was still playing in the background and at this point the voices stopped and i started listening to the music while still keeping my eyes closed and seeing geometric patterns this is where it got really weird but also really cool all of a sudden my body started moving in sync with the music and i was half laying on my bed but doing strange dance moves with my body and hands and even feet this for me was very stramge as i am not the type of person who dances i normally feel awkward and rather uncoordinated when it comes to dancing so its not something that i do but this was genuinely keeping exactly with the rhythm of the song and it was as if i knew the lyrics and the music by heart as it was playing but i had never even heard the song before so this is impossible.<br /><br />As i was doing this strange dance of mine all of a sudden my entire body was filled with pure joy this is a feeling that i have never felt before in my entire life i literally felt like from head to toe every part of my being was as happy as it could be and i was so overcome by the feeling that tears started coming out of my eyes from the extreme amount of joy i felt and then i started laughing and all i could think was wow this is amazing to be honest i actually forget exactly what happened after that but this was pretty much when i started to come back to the real world and i sat on my bed with a feeling of accomplishment and a massive smile on my face as DMT had been something i had been wanting to use for a long time and not only did it live up to my expectations it far surpassed them i then wrote a comment on youtube but i have just decided i wont post that here as it could expose my identity.<br /><br />My 2nd experience with DMT was also very enjoyable but to be honest i cant really remember any of it now.<br /><br />Okay my 3rd experience was what i consider to be the bad trip and this time i was actually hesitant to take it i wasnt in the best place emotionally and i was basically taking it just to see if it could make me feel a bit happy for atleast a little while but i felt very reluctant to do it and basically talked myself into it even though i had a feeling that i should keep it for another time. Ok so i decided to go with the sandwich method again as it had worked for me so far and i pulled the cone then lay down on my bed again almost instantly i felt a pressure on my face and then i saw what i call the goddess she was much larger than a human and had a sort of aztec/mayan kind of appearance atleast thats how i perceived it to be anyway next thing i know she is sticking her fingers in to my face they were kind of stretching out and getting pointy as they pushed in to my face and i felt extreme pressure to the point where i had to open my eyes because it kind of freaked me out a little bit i then closed my eyes again and instantly she started pushing her finger in to my face and the pressure returned at this point something in my head told me that this was like a test and that if i couldnt pass the test then i wouldnt be able to breakthrough again so i simply lay there and let her stab me in the face the pressure increased and i did actually feel pain but it wasnt serious pain it was just enough to make you want to open your eyes and get it to stop still i persisted and then goddess dissapeared and the pressure stopped. I felt relieved but i was also curious as to where this &quot;being&quot;had gone i was now left with some fractals and geometric patterns the type of things you might see on mushrooms or LSD but this didnt last long and then i returned to the real world feeling quite strange and wondering why this dmt trip was so different from my first 2 i came to the conclusion that it was because i was hesitant and not in the best place and was simply using the DMT almost recreationally just to get a high and feel better whereas the other times especially the first time i was extremely excited and happy about using it and it was much more of a spiritual mission of discovery than simply wanting to get high.<br /><br />I believe the DMT or whatever the place is that we go to on DMT is aware of our intentions when we use and the experience we have is a direct outcome of the intent we go in to it with but this is just how i feel about it i am definitely open to discussion on the subject and i may even change my own opinion after i use it again in the future.<br /><br />Thanks for reading much love to all.<br /><br />iiivision

The anxiety was more towards the fact that it even happened, I was upset that it was my first experience like that as I had hoped to never have a bad DMT trip.<br /><br />Funny enough, after about 10 minutes when the visuals started to subside, I actually laughed at how stupid the situation was and how I could be so naive to think I could get away with that much DMT in such a short time. All that stuff about people saying to not &quot;disappoint the elf spirits&quot;, is absolutely right.<br /><br />If you piss them off, they&#039;ll fuck with your head. Don&#039;t abuse the spice<br /><br />and uhhh... don&#039;t try to breakthrough the day after partying on MDMA.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I actually recommend breaking through when you&#039;re under the influence of MDMA for a much more calm, spiritual, and tolerable break-through.

				Had about 4 truly great and enlightening times on DMT, and a fucking horrific time more recently.<br /><br />Always been nervous before taking it. Was less scared before this time though.<br /><br />Spawned in the other dimension, underground, murky brown dungeon. Intense feeling of infinite dread. Some sort of slithering being hiding from me yet watching.<br /><br />This was the night after consuming some MDMA, so again this seems to agree with the above.<br /><br />DMT on an MDMA comedown looks like a bad move.
