				It really shouldn&#039;t be all that shocking - belief in creationism is directly related to the level of religiosity of a country.<br /><br />Americans are more religious than Europeans, and as such believe in creationism more than Europeans. In America, we also have a unique form of Protestantism that takes the bible extremely literally.&nbsp; While in the eyes of Catholics and European Protestants, evolution and Christianity are perfectly compatible, American Evangelical Protestants would consider evolution to be contradicting their faith.&nbsp; Evangelical children are also taught at a young age not to trust their teachers - they are considered liberal propagandists.&nbsp; Teachers are also oftentimes afraid to share their own views.&nbsp; These evangelical students will often ask their science teacher, &quot;So do you believe in evolution?&quot;&nbsp; Usually, the teacher will not answer the question, but one of my high school science teachers had a great response - she just replied, &quot;Remember the first day of class when we talked about what science is and isn&#039;t? Science isn&#039;t based on belief, so you can&#039;t believe in evolution just like you don&#039;t believe in gravity.&quot; <br /><br />Some of the statistics, though, are deliberately misleading, as they will label someone who accepts evolution, but believes it was guided by god to be a creationist.<br /><br />The schools in the US teach the scientific theory.&nbsp; It&#039;s illegal to teach creationism or intelligent design in a public school classroom, and most states have requirements to teach evolution in high school science.

				None of those countries, except Poland, is particularly religious by American standards.<br /><br />Poland also has a significantly higher rate of creationists than more secular European countries like the UK and France.<br /><br />European countries with a proportion of creationists comparable to the US include Turkey, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Croatia, Poland and Austria - which all happen to be among the more religious European countries.

				Creationism and Darwinism seriously need to be debunked! <br /><br />Did you know that Darwin did not even coin the phrase &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;?<br /><br />The English philosopher Herbert Spencer did, who first used it in his 1864 book, Principles of Biology! <br /><br />I have read this book, and would suggest if this subject, interests you to read it too, it&#039;s a great read!<br /><br />HUMAN EVOLUTION <br /><br />Is the truth, in fact we are still evolving right now, and it&#039;s happening faster than ever! <br /><br />We are generally getting stronger, taller, and living longer! That is, of course, if your in the right place in the world, but that&#039;s another debate altogether!<br /><br />And despite using our cultures and technologies, as ways of adapting to our ever changing environments, we undergo &quot;GENETIC CHANGES&quot; as our way of natural response, or in our human case favourable traits in our genes!<br /><br />No creationism, no darwinism, and no hokus pokus! <br /><br />As I said, we&#039;re evolving, it&#039;s happening, right now, everyone wake up! :)<br /><br />Thank-you Ahoyboy for letting me know about this doc, please make me aware of it&#039;s full name! I&#039;ll save an hour of my life by not watching it!<br /><br />America, what&#039;s up? If you believe in this, your not devolving not evolving!<br /><br />Fingers crossed, the ever evolving human genes, will do their work, and it will all pan out in the end!<br /><br />Hopefully! :)

				The majority of people involved on both sides of the debate have never actually read the damn book. Read the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin if you are serious. What kind of people read articles and books on the book, but not the source material? Groupthink, that&#039;s who. Similarly, most Christians have never read the damn Bible either. Which is absolutely amazing when you think about it and all the fuss over this argument.<br /><br />If you rely on other people&#039;s interpretations of an idea, then you&#039;re not thinking properly. I also hate it when Communists don&#039;t bother to actually read or even glance over Das Kapital or Capitalists haven&#039;t read The Wealth of Nations.<br /><br />Read.<br /><br />Protip: They are both out of copyright...

				For many US christians, acceptance of creationsim is just a culteral convention; it&#039;s something they profess to set their own community apart from outsiders.&nbsp; It&#039;s an example of an intellectual isolationism that christian leaders promote to keep their congregations cohesive, and to protect them from individualist ideas that would be their church&#039;s undoing.&nbsp; It&#039;s the same challenge faced by fundamentalist islam.&nbsp; Fundamentlaists of both groups have to turn their backs on modernity and on science; either turn their backs to those things or be changed by them, and one thing fundamentalists of all types have in common is that they abhor the idea of change.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Do christian fundamentallists truly believe in creationsim?&nbsp; Belief can be superficial.&nbsp; To truly believe, one mus think deeply and unselfishly consider all available evidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the fundamentalist&#039;s belief in creationism rise to this standard?&nbsp; Personally, I suspect it rarely does, and so for me the fact that many profess to believe in creationsim means very little.

				Oh god, the creationism thing here in the U.S. is just ridiculous. The number of religious nuts in this country is probably greater than the actual population of most other countries. Somewhere around 50% don&#039;t believe in evolution (read: don&#039;t understand basic science), and a similar number wouldn&#039;t even consider voting for an atheist for public office, regardless of his political views. Atheists in this country are trusted less than Muslims and homosexuals, which is really saying something given the hatred towards both those groups in this country as well. Why just last week, the owner of a restaurant called Chick-Fil-A came out and said that gay marriage is bad, and a couple days ago there was a nationwide &quot;Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day&quot; where sales records were set, all in support of prejudice. This is the kind of shit I have to deal every day in my country. I&#039;m an atheist, drug-using, gay-supporting, socialist. In this country, about 80% of the population probably wants to lock me up. <br /><br />My current girlfriend actually used to be a fundamentalist Christian. She grew up in that type of religious household that makes it hard not to be. Anyways, I got talking with her, and eventually I convinced her to try mushrooms with me. We each did 3g of the finest shit you can get on the Silk Road. During the trip, she eventually realized that Christianity made no sense and neither did belief in God for that matter. She also realized that sex was fine before marriage. So there&#039;s the secret people! Get your local fundies to try some nice psychedelic magic and let the problems fix themselves. Actually there are a number of people that I would love to sit in a room together and give them each like 200mg of MDMA, and watch the problems sort themselves out. Owner of Chick-Fil-A and a homosexual: &quot;Hey man, you&#039;re actually a pretty cool guy, I&#039;m not sure what I was thinking calling you a pervert and depriving you of rights.&quot; The leaders of Israel and Palestine: &quot;Dude, you&#039;re such a cool fucking guy, like what is this whole war about? Man let&#039;s just settle it, take what land you want. Hey, you want to touch my wife&#039;s tits?&quot; Oh how much better the world would be. Remind me if I ever become king of the world to proclaim a National Feel Amazing day, in which everyone of age and without health problems will take at least a 150mg dose of MDMA, and all will be well.

				By logical induction it is clear, that there is &#039;reason&#039; for all to be and for all to constantly change.<br /><br />By reading bible I can&#039;t get rid of jewish smell.

Well, since Soviet Union no more, and China is yet on the rise, US is only &quot;super&quot;country in the world, and it dumbens US masses considerably.&nbsp; Add to dumb mass historical relation with ancient bible, and there you have it.<br /><br />Belief in itself is not knowledge. Non-knowledge. I don&#039;t believe in any stupid JHW, Allah, Ganesha, or any other hallucination whomever can come up with. I know, that reason exists, and I doubt that there is any connection between my reason to exist, and universes reason to exist.<br /><br />And here is conclusion: us religious people tend more, statistically of course, to consider themselves as center and reason of universe to be. But again - so what? People did it as long, as they were. And it was never right thing... *sigh*<br />

				Right, this might be a bit controversial but fuck it.

As long as it&#039;s not pushed down my throat then I don&#039;t really give a shit what people want to believe in, it&#039;s not my business.

				I completely agree, limetless.&nbsp; Given that the Supreme Court in the US has ruled that it&#039;s illegal to teach creationism or intelligent design in a public school science classroom, it really doesn&#039;t affect my life whether people choose to believe in a myth.&nbsp; When I have kids and their classmates start telling them they&#039;re going to hell for their beliefs, I might feel differently, though.

What I&#039;m trying to say is: Murrica is weird. What does it take for those guys to forget the gay/gun/obamacare shit for a while and get together for the important stuff? Occupy was just ridiculed, but at least they did something. <br /><br />Sorry for offtopic rant :) USA is a cool themepark/shoppingmall, but would have so much more potential. I just refuse to believe that all people are that stupid.

Complex crystaline structures exists which have the ability to mutate. These structures (complex by chemical standards, simple by biological standards) are not &#039;life&#039;, but the ability to mutate and add complexity is key to the concept of life. The theory holds that if a powerful agent such as electricity via a bolt of lightning acted upon them the result has the potential to add further complexity and that one of these reactions jump started life. The first life would have been little more than a complex chemical structure with the power to mutate and add to its own complexity.<br /><br />Essentially, the theory holds that life started when lightning struck a bunch of chemicals. <br />

				I agree with the OP on his points - watching documentaries where devoutly religious americans are challenged about creationism - or any aspect of the bible - is very frustrating!<br /><br />I think that when someone stops arguing logically, backing up their argument with provable evidence, and instead uses the concept of blind faith - is the point when their argument becomes null, void and ridiculous.<br /><br />According to the bible, planet earth - in fact the whole universe - is only 10,000 years old... despite unarguable and globally accepted evidence to the contrary...<br /><br />It boggles my mind that in 2012 devoutly religious people still fall back on the &quot;blind faith&quot; argument despite an uncountable amount of scientific evidenve that requires no faith at all! Proof is proof! why can&#039;t they get that? It&#039;s like tryin to get a mischevious 7 year old to admit they stole a cookie out of the jar when they have crumbs round their mouth...

Darwin said as much when he was talking about the chalk hills of England being originally composed of living animals (he was an amateur geologist too), it takes a certain frame of mind to appreciate the vast scope and implications of such a slow and powerful process. <br /><br />That is partly why some scientists deliberately use psychedelics or amphetamines to further their inspiration. But for Thomas Malthus&#039;s Essay on Population Growth and Charles Lyell&#039;s (I think) book on geology, &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (he discovered the earth was billions of years old vs tens of thousands as commonly thought by even many scientists of the day), we would have never had the formation of the Theory of Evolution by means of Natural Selection that was Darwin&#039;s contribution to Science. At least not from Charles Darwin anyway. I would say biology only became a science from this point onwards, similar to how Adam Smith&#039;s discovery of the Division of Labor turned economics into a science. The modern world owes an exceptionally disproportionate debt to the Scottish race, which is why I&#039;m a big fan of them and their nuttiness :-)<br /><br />Organized religion is today after all, a form of learned imagination, it does all the work for you. Once upon a time the Church (both groups) was the main supporter of Natural Philosophy as it was called then, and many Christians were fantastic scientists or natural philosophers, believing it was very spiritual to investigate the natural world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is now the position of a tiny majority of Christians in today&#039;s world. I can respect any truthseeker, any thinking person, whether Christian or Atheist who believes in an objective truth and strives after the shape of it, even if it is hard to understand. But deliberately cultivated ignorance and unquestioning respect to authority I cannot stand. This is why I hate any groupthink, irrespective of what ideology it is coming from.<br /><br />In my view, you could have a high I.Q, and yet be a mental midget if you aren&#039;t an independent thinker. Richard Feynman was a genius, but wasn&#039;t as quick as his peers (remember the average I.Q of almost any physicist is extremely high vs the average, I think 150+). Yet he was extremely effective and productive in his field, he dominated it. Actually if you read about Feynman, you quickly find that his character is exceptionally familiar, he was very much the classic /b/tard, like one of the smarter anons. Lulz is a concept Feynman would have had no trouble with. This is also why I favor 4chan users over facebook users, they might be composed of spectra from banal to genius, but at least they form their own thoughts. You could trawl Facebook for years worth of communications without crossing a stray original thought.
