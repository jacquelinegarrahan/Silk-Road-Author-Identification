				Feminists trying to ban porn<br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2440595/Online-porn-Culture-Secretary-Maria-Miller-says-schools-MUST-teach-pupils-risks.html#ixzz2gXw7V0Zn<br /><br />Notice the article says:<br /><br />&quot;Charities say children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet porn, giving them ‘unrealistic expectations’ of sex. They also say it is encouraging boys to grow up viewing girls merely as sex objects.&quot;<br /><br />Why shouldn&#039;t women go out of their way to try to sexually please a man? Why are western women so brainwashed by man-hatred and feminism?<br /><br />As for &quot;treating women like sex objects&quot;. Remember, it&#039;s okay for women to treat MEN like sex objects, to treat men as objects, to treat men as walking wallets and sperm donors. But god forbid if a MAN treats a WOMAN as an object.<br /><br />In short, these femninists and western women are just freaked out by the effects of porn on men. After all, after watching porn, real sex with real women doesn&#039;t satisfy men anymore, and thus the men are far less likely TO GET MARRIED. And if men stop getting married, that means women won&#039;t be financially supported by men anymore. And thus, women will have no choice but to become INDEPENDENT and support themselves and pay their own bills.<br /><br />There is nothing that terrifies women more than being independent.<br /><br />The biggest threat to freedom in the West today is its WOMEN. Women are constantly trying to destroy our freedoms by voting big government liberal/socialist parties which are creating a fascist police state. In the end, it will have been women who destroyed modern civilization with their political correctness, their feminism, their socialism, their affirmative action, their false lawsuits against men, etc, etc, etc. The West is collapsing right now, and it is the fault of women.<br />

				man if i could minus you a hundred i would. I guess you missed the news that more than 40% of households in the US are now headed by women. that would be independent strong women. Men are great to have around and all, but hardly NECESSARY anymore. sounds like someone has been rejected too&nbsp; many times or something.&nbsp; And women are responsible for the destruction of it all? Well, sir, who the fuck has been running shit since the beginning of time? Men-and look where we are-great job fellas. Maybe we should let the women take over before we pass the point of no return.&nbsp; Hope you get some or whatever you need to straighten your ignorant ass up.
