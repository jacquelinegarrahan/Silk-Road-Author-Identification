				I think snorting the stuff is just a method of keeping my craving in check. Most of coke users would agree that by only sniffing, coke can be played &quot;safely&quot; and with minimum % of getting &quot;hooked&quot;.<br />I write this simply because my love and respect for Coca is immense and beyond words, but if I would to buy base and light it up : leading my brain to &quot;hard-write&quot; itself in a way that from now on, sniffing would not make the same buzz anymore and I will be destined to smoke the stuff for the rest of my life.<br />This is just my personal paranoia regarding smoking Coca.<br />I&#039;m sure it was quite an experience for you and thank you for sharing with us your first ( and hopfully last ) Bellringer.<br />Happy holidays

				\I&#039;m not a fan of sniffing coke, its a pretty shit buzz, crack on the other hand is the best buzz there is. I prefer to smoke drugs though anyway.

Then come back and tell here how it was. It&#039;s definetely something everyone should experience before dying.
