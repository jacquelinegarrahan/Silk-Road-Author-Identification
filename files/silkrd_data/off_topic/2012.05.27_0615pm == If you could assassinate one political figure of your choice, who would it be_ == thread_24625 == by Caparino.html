				Title: <strong>If you could assassinate one political figure of your choice, who would it be?</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>Caparino</strong> on <strong>May 27, 2012, 06:15 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				The obvious answer would be: All of them. But if you had to pick one because of their behavior, proceedings, and stance on subjects; who would it be? Of course the display of having different politicians to vote for inevitably gives way for us to stay busy in our views of them; in turn allowing the real deciders of the world to carry on their game of chess. But for a moment, let&#039;s pretend it isn&#039;t at all like that and politicians with different views make the real difference in their efforts to &quot;better the world&quot;. <br /><br />At the current, I&#039;d pick president hopeful Mitt Romney. He&#039;s likely to move forward with a presidency that sends the U.S. in the depths of Fascism under the veil of Capitalism. Not that we aren&#039;t there already, but I can foresee the future conditions of America to mirror that of China or Nazi Germany. That is solely my opinion based on philology I&#039;ve studied in my day, but I&#039;d like to see any opposing views on this. Having said that, I&#039;d say President Obama is just like all the other recent presidents; he promises one thing and moves forward with another. Along the way he receives kickbacks and sides with certain corporations and is actually insinuating unfriendly dealings with the Middle-Eastern empire of modern day Persia: Iran. I&#039;d have him shot in a second too, but I believe in the metaphor of picking the less lethal of two poisons, so I&#039;d rather have him continue on with a second term. <br /><br />-Cap

				this is very true.&nbsp; they like playing their roll in control, providing the brainwashing.&nbsp; who cares if russia is threatening to shoot the u.s.&#039;s missle silos located in the e.u., and japan has had to shut down their nuclear power plants, and have plenty of uranium to sell to iran if israel attacks.&nbsp; as long as there&#039;s fat people losing weight, bad singers having contests, and sports on the boob tube.&nbsp; ron paul wants to go back to the constitution, can&#039;t be having that.

Even if he did have the power (which he doesn&#039;t, because the Ayatollah rules Iran, not its president) what makes you think he would when his country doesn&#039;t even have one nuke? Meanwhile, Israel with their not so secret stockpile of a couple hundred nuclear warheads, and the most capable and feared military power in the Middle East, would just love it if they were attacked by Iran since it would give them the excuse to pulverize the country into oblivion. Plus, everyone knows they pwn the most feared country in the world that would just go running like a loyal pit bull to their side in any war, so why would any sane actor choose to take on both Israel AND the US? You must think Ahmadinejad is suicidal to think he&#039;d do such a thing, but he&#039;s never given any indication that he&#039;s irrational or unstable. The &quot;wiping Israel off the map&quot; bit played well with his audience and in much of the Middle East where Israel is despised, they were not the words of a mad man.<br /><br />Nonetheless, your fear of Ahmadinejad is totally unfounded given the developments in Iranian politics over the last few years. Ahmadinejad owed his power and position to the support of the real man in charge, the Ayatollah with whom with he had a very ugly major falling out. He&#039;s since been utterly marginalized and repeatedly humiliated by the super mullah who&#039;s made a very public fool of him probably also to remind the candidates of the upcoming election to never forget their singular responsibility should be kissing his ass. Ahmadinejad is the lamest of lame ducks who, after the coming election to replace him, will probably be a dead duck.&nbsp;

Israel and the U.S. won&#039;t get off of Iran&#039;s dick for researching nuclear weapons. They&#039;re basically saying: &quot;We want to be the only countries with nukes. If you don&#039;t stop enriching uranium, we&#039;re going to start a war.&quot; I think it&#039;s highly unreasonable in both it&#039;s reasoning and it&#039;s hypocrisy. Would a single country, especially such a small one, dare launch any sort of nukes on any member of the U.S. alliance? I&#039;m not even mentioning how a World War is needed in this resource lacking, over-populated world of today. And whether you guys realize it or not, development of Nuclear Energy is a means of advancing as a civilization. Before the high levels of enrichment required to build Nuclear Weapons, the lower levels of enrichment allow creation of renewable energy. <br /><br />If you&#039;re trying to grow pot plants in your backyard, and two douchebags in the neighborhood approach you and tell you to stop because they grew it first. Would you just stop? Fuck that shit, I&#039;d tell them to go eat a bucket full of dicks.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24625.msg261867#msg261867">Quote from: overman on May 28, 2012, 03:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whatever prick is in charge of Hamas/ PaleSLIMEians because I have family in Israel and they are a violent people with no history and their Arab friends launch aggressive wars every now and then...Good thing that we won them all.<br /><br />Also Assad, I don&#039;t want to hear about 100+ children getting killed, Arabs or not it doesn&#039;t matter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Holy Crap, Jewish people are racist lol

				Yeah, that&#039;s the part you&#039;re missing.&nbsp; Iran is NOT the aggressor in the Middle East.&nbsp; The US and Israel are.&nbsp; Iran would be INSANE to start a war with Israel.&nbsp; Like I said, look up a ranking of world military power.&nbsp; Israel would wipe the floor with Iran even without US involvement.&nbsp; Ahmedinejad may be many things, but #1 he isn&#039;t even in charge of the military and #2 he isn&#039;t insane.&nbsp; Ahmedinejad is a near powerless figurehead that is only in power so long as he does what he is told.&nbsp; The Mullahs and the Ayatollah hold all of the power in Iran.<br /><br />Look at a map of the Middle East.&nbsp; Look at where Iraq is.&nbsp; Look at where Afghanistan is.&nbsp; What&#039;s in the Middle?&nbsp; If China invaded Canada AND Mexico don&#039;t you think the US might start a little saber-rattling.<br /><br />Seriously, stop getting your information about foreign policy from the mainstream US media and pick up a book.&nbsp; If you like cartoons, I recommend Persepolis as a good place to start for some insight into the history of Iran and US involvement in the Middle East.

Like everyone&#039;s been telling you, he has no real power so his actions won&#039;t do jack shit.<br /><br />If you were saying that about the messianic prime minister of Israel who for the last year has been trying to figure out the best way to get the US to fight his war of choice against Iran for him, then we&#039;d all be nodding in agreement because you&#039;d actually have a very good point.<br /><br />But pointing to a marginalized, powerless has been who isn&#039;t even taken seriously anymore in Iran much less the rest of the world, demonstrates you really have no idea what you&#039;re talking about and never really did.
