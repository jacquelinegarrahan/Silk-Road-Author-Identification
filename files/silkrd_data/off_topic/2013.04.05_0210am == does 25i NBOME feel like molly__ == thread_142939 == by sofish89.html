				I got some 25i in the other day and i havent got a chance to trip yet.&nbsp; I told my friends i got this RC in and i asked any if they wanted to try them out. So i gave them a bunch of free tabs and they told me that the 25i was like rolling off molly but more intense. They said their eyes were geeking and everything was really bright and they saw like 12 of everything. and also they said they felt really amazing, just like molly feels? Did anybody have an experience similiar to what they are saying?

				25i normally makes me feel happier, some euphoria, and I&#039;ll laugh a lot. It never made me feel like rolling though I get the speedy connection. I don&#039;t like sitting still while on the stuff. I don&#039;t know about the vision thing, things will breathe and wave a bit. Sometimes I&#039;ll close my eyes and get kaleidoscope affect so that could be what they were talking about. <br /><br />25d makes me roll on occasion ... really intense rolls that seem to go on and on. <br /><br />However, we&#039;re talking about RC&#039;s so depending on synthesis I imagine each batch would give off different &quot;flavors&quot; of affects.

				I guess its sort of like that.. but NOT.. <br /><br />25b is a bit more Euphoric if you ask me.. <br /><br />Just watch how much you take of ether the body load can be REALLY NASTY at higher dosages..
