				right on mate I just moved to a new location. True that my life is just getting under way. Here at the new place not been much to do except getting moved in and I have mowed twice so far and planted some tomatoes. That&#039;s about it seriously. I can&#039;t wait to start my new job not only for the extra bread but also for something to do. I&#039;m highly energetic so when there&#039;s something to do, it don&#039;t last long. I been an internet junky for years now. What can I say, I love this site. I been a member of many forums and websites but this one is the closest to my heart with the subjects. Yes I will slow it the fuck down no problem. Have a great day you all and happy memorial day(like I give a fuck hahahah)

				this is funny as a mother fucker! Just a few post and a few different signature changes and I see that I&#039;ve pissed some people off with that stuff I wrote about your bible. hahahahahahahahaha<br /><br />We each have our own world. I&#039;ll make it here on SR even if I am hated by a select few bible thumpers because I am actually honest and you won&#039;t see me fucking people out of their money. You won&#039;t see me posting lies about folks. I&#039;m a vendor in real life and before long I&#039;ll be vending here so it&#039;s ok, I understand your reserves about me. Hopefully, in the future, I will earn the respect I deserve from those who want to hate on me.<br /><br />One thing tho: if you don&#039;t like my opinion about the bible then don&#039;t bring it up to me.

				Punkhippy and Ralph are both completely worthless.<br /><br />Thanks to the faggot spammer Punkhippy, we now have a case of a dumbass kid getting a sample and, out of sheer ignorance, said it was LSD when it was CLEARLY and RC. But since he was a little kid with a distorted title it verified the bullshit product.<br /><br />Fuck these two losers.

				Ok so you are punkhippy. That clears up half of the story then, but whats up with the 300+ posts? Youve been a member since may 20th and you have twice as many posts as me. Ive been here since February dude.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Im pretty sure your punkhippy account had like 300+ posts as well, and I know that punkhippy was fairly new to the forums as well, so of course people are gonna hate. If your gonna post something here at least try to make it something of value that is informative to the community.<br /><br />Does your post count or karma actually make you feel important? Thats pretty sad if its true. This isnt a popularity contest. I dont know about anyone else but i come here for information pertaining to the lifestyle that i choose to live and to pay homage to the great founder of this wonderful place and to all who work so hard to keep it up and running. <br /><br /><br />

				Ill reiterate that im fucked up right now, thats being said i have no idea what youre talking about.....<br /><br />What because i said 600+posts is gay? I got nothing against gay folk. They dOnt bother me one bit. I personally love pussy and worship the shit (unless it smells like sanitation) lmao.<br /><br />I got no beefs with you chief. Or anyone for that matter. Just telling it likes i see it.<br /><br />BTW I totally respect your position on anonymity. If you checked my message to you and arent cool with it no hard feelings whatsoever. <br /><br />May the drug gods smile upon all you, and may they deliver your products without any issues and as fast as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy Memorial Day.... Im gonna go blow some shit up!

Chill the fuck out or we&#039;ll continue badgering you to kindly fuck off. For one thing stop posting over and over again after yourself. It makes you look like an attention hungry faggot craving some black cock.
