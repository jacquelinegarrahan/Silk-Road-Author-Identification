				I&#039;ve found that working with people who&#039;ve been inside can either be a curse or a blessing. LE and most of the world don&#039;t understand what an asset individuals like this one can be. Their thoughts are continually thwarted by association biases and societal norms. Here&#039;s my take on the subject after extensive experience in this area, I am very selective but I believe my results can be replicated by anybody.<br /><br />On one hand, they have a record and all the caveats that generates, but then again they also know how to STFU, which is worth *a lot* in this market. Otherwise intelligent civilians who are newcomers to criminality often leave their brain at the door of the police station. As far as job prospects go, check your convict for signs of (irrational) paranoia, magic thoughts, and either make sure they are clean, or more likely, invest in rehab and gym membership until your man is ready. You also have to pay well, well above the extraordinarily shit pay doled out like it&#039;s a favor to street level dealers, but in the end it&#039;s worth it. Give a man respect, and they will repay you in loyalty a thousand times over. <br /><br />The civil service in India paid its servants of the Empire extremely well. They were rigorously well trained.<br />The result? A triumph of small government. Thousands of the civil service managed to successfully and consistently rule over a population of two hundred million souls. Think of it! That&#039;s real power. The vast majority of those ruled *never* met the agents who made the system work. Haiku like simplicity. Most corporations can be structured along similar lines, look at Berkshire Hathaway, it is one of the most influential organizations in the world and it has a handful of employees, five or ten I think. <br /><br />I have been very rarely let down in the past, despite my competitors apparently using a revolving door policy with people and as a result getting infiltrated by informants and undercover LE like there is no tomorrow. I sleep easy knowing that everybody connected to me could be rounded up in the morning and LE would be staring at a mesh of self-interest completely opposed to cooperation. Credit derives from the ancient credo, meaning trust or confidence. Money itself and trust are inextricably bound up with one another. Money is only pieces of paper, it is something much more than that. Honor is in the dollar.<br /><br />There is somebody here whose sig goes something like: you&#039;ve got to be honest to be in the black market. There&#039;s a lot of truth in that. Too many would throw their employees into the maw of LE without thinking twice. I think of myself as a part-time HR manager cultivating intelligent risk taking, not irrational risk taking, loyalty is a two way street here. Nobody I invested in ever went back inside. It&#039;s the oldest deal in history, you say to your fellows, work in my favor and I will bring you up with me. That is how it should be.<br /><br />tldr; Take your Black Market Education seriously instead of treating it like a hobby or part-time job like the majority of those in the trade do (largely in denial at every level). Like you were getting an MBA in Narcotics and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Black Market Capitalism. Ipsa scientia potestas est.

				its always scary for the first 6-12 mths you don&#039;t know everyone and sometimes people are looking to make a name for themselves so they can hit it off with the bikers or different factions in there.Best thing stay quiet till spoken too and get a shive as soon as possible because you can almost guarantee that everyone else has one

				@speedcrunch- prison can be a VASTLY different experience dpending on many factors,such as what state you&#039;re doing time in,how long you&#039;re in for,WHAT you&#039;re in for,and I would say most importantly-how you carry yourself. Having the right attitude and the smarts to know who not to affiliate with has more to do with survival than pumping iron or carrying a big shank in the long run. That being said,I have witnessed horrible acts of violence and rape,and had to fight for my life and my lil anus n purdy mouf countless times...but I must say I am a better man in a lot of ways due to what I experienced.<br />@phubaiblues- I agree completely about not putting out too much identifying info. I feel like I&#039;m toeing the line but safe,but I&#039;m amazed at some the things people post...I won&#039;t quote any examples or else id just be perpetuating the...poor judgement? Naivete? Apathy?

Unfortunately this was at super young, yep girl brought her moms pills to school and of course I fell into it and decided to monopolize, a few kids getting their stomachs pumped later and I was getting my blood pressure checked while in handcuffs.

Is it in your cell?<br />Is it true theirs a vast amount of drugs? Are they priced average or does it take 300 dollars of commissary money for a half gram of coke from&nbsp; some guys ass. <br />I hear some prisons hand out prescriptions like nothing, is this true?<br />Do people still get raped?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Generally, NEVER ant net access, unless youre like an administrative trustee or something. There are some camps where if you are a trustee you can have your own cell and tv, but I did my jolst in a state where it mostly open dorms and a central tv area. And yes rape is rampant. Some of the pervy disgusting shit I saw and heard made me ashamed to be male. PLENTY of drugs,alot of times more so than the streets. And yes they usually love to pass out psych meds to keep the &quot;disciplinary&quot; cases docile...

				Prison is basically criminal university. You go in and learn better methods to do crime, get zero rehabilitation and get out a more motivated and careful criminal. Almost every violent street gang in my city started in a juvenile hall or prison yard. Before they were amateurs now they&#039;re all ruthless professionals after getting out.<br /><br />Some prisons in the US let you have access to email through Corrlinks, there is TV ect. Prison is a ridiculous hell hole, they even consider National Geographic contraband.
