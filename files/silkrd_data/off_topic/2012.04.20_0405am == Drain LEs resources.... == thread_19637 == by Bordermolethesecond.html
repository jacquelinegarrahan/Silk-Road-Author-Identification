				What would be a cheap but effective way to drain LEs resources in your local area. <br /><br />E.g. kit out a house for growing weed but have herbs or tomatoes under the lights like kopbuster. Tell them about the growhouse, then watch them buy a new door for it after the raid. <br />Even that would be expensive though, house rent and all that. Any other ideas?

				Find unoccupied cop cars, wear a mask, slash tires put shit in the gas tank to ruin it, or just set it on fire with a Molotov cocktail. That will get pretty expensive pretty fast. Make sure to also wear gloves and to wear a pair of disposable shoes and to not carry your phone with you and all of that. <br /><br />Flood their websites with fake tips, do so from open WiFi or Tor. <br /><br />

				how about calling 911 and saying your neighbor is holding his wife hostage? Work it out so that they bring swat teams thats expensive I think.<br /><br />Or call in bomb threats at the airport as that could cost a lot too.

				Well in northern California the camp assholes get so much help finding outdoor grows from the public on there gay little tip line.&nbsp; I just never could understand why a million stoners weren&#039;t calling in tips constantly.&nbsp; It would disassociate them like a motherfucker.&nbsp; In your local town call crime stoppers constantly to report suspicious neighbors WHO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE ARE NOT INTO DRUGS!&nbsp; that would put em on a wild goose chase.&nbsp; However remember doing things like this are a crime probably making false reports to a police officer and fucking with an investigation (not in those words)

				My idea:&nbsp; The ounce a week club<br /><br />Every week, an ounce of weed is divided in 1 gram bags and using extremely poor shipping (possibly from the Netherlands), 28 orders are shipped to the homes of Dea agents, judges, politicians, policeman, etc.&nbsp; Basically, those prosecuting the drug war.&nbsp; If the packaging was poor enough (basically a gram of weed just shoved into an envelope with no vacume sealing of course.&nbsp; With 28 packages being sent out per week, we could expect to get interceptions on a few a week.<br /><br />This would serve several purposes:<br />&nbsp;Those arrested or questioned will all be using the defense that they didn&#039;t order anything and that they were set up.&nbsp; Its one thing to be the one person standing alone saying he was set up but it would be nice to have the media running stories all of the time about people receiving drugs that they didn&#039;t order.&nbsp; On the other hand, if a dea agent or police officer were prosecuted and found guilty for a gram of weed, it would show the hypocricy of the drug war.<br /><br />It would be great to see those that actually had to go to court arguing that the laws were unjust.<br /><br />Obviously you wouldn&#039;t want to set up anyone that wasn&#039;t directly involved in the drug war.&nbsp; &nbsp;Live by the sword, die by the sword.&nbsp; <br /><br />Disclaimer.&nbsp; Now that I read this I have to say this is more of just a fantasy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone should actually do this.&nbsp; Even as much as I hate dea agents and those prosecuting the drug war, I guess I don&#039;t really want an innocent person to be set up, even a jerk.&nbsp; &nbsp; I just can&#039;t understand how people can live with themselves arresting and imprisoning people for weed.<br /><br />

				Plus it is a pretty good deterrent if all of your coworkers start dying <br /><br />the more time that passes the more people I know facing life sentences for this shit and the less a fuck I give about what it will take to defeat these evil fuckers. They deserve absolutely no mercy and should be entirely wiped off the face of the world. THEY ARE WILLING AND EAGER TO TAKE YOUR LIFE, NOTHING ELSE SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU DECIDE HOW THEY SHOULD BE DEALT WITH. <br /><br />Anyone who disagrees is just an apologist and probably would have felt so sorry for the Nazi executioners who were just regular guys doing their job to support their families that they would be apologists for them too. Some people are not just doing a job, some people are not just misguided, and even if these things are true it isn&#039;t your job to enlighten the rabid dogs coming after you it&#039;s your job to put them down. People who use a lot of psychedelics have way too much empathy and respect for life, to the point that they are almost masochistic in their unwillingness to accept that there are enemies in this world who need to be dealt with by whatever means required. <br /><br />Do you really think society is going to suddenly feel so bad for what they do to us that they are going to even try to help? Fucking joke, those brainwashed zombie human-like-creatures would have woken up decades ago if they were ever going to. They do what they are told by people who convince them that they are authorities, and the only thing they understand is fear just like all of the other simple animals (which is why their &#039;leaders&#039; keep them perpetually terrified of all the boogie men). <br /><br />Just as bad is this mentality that we need to just prove to them how responsible we are even though we are drug users, we don&#039;t owe them a fucking thing for one and for two they don&#039;t give a shit! You live in delusions if you think that these monsters really give a fuck if you are a serious criminal or a responsible drug user they are human predators and you are their prey.

				That is hard to do when the government funds them..... Not to mention all the asset seizures they get. Our whole town got all new Dodge Charger&#039;s just to look cool I guess, because there isn&#039;t anybody to chase around here. They like to speed down the street at night in them, and feel like a bad ass.<br /><br />It is like giving someone a bazooka to kill a squirell when they already had a .22.

				Basic LE frustration: If you&#039;re a vendor post metadata cleaned screenshots of your desktop or other pics with subtle misdirection clues, like being logged into a fake skype account or email account. Post your drug pictures with faked GPS coords and other data. Pretend to slip up and release misinformation. Find a character and play it while writing posts here, give subtle clues to who that fake misdirection character is in your posts with unique colloquialisms you would never use outside here and spelling mistakes. Pretend you work as a cab driver, waiter, banker, anything. Write prose using distinct slang you would never use, like pretending to be a UK student living in California. &quot;You look like a bell-end and are as thick as a whale omelette&quot;. If you&#039;re a Canadian in Toronto shipping drugs talk about your high school days back in Halifax that didn&#039;t exist through subtlety. If you go on vacation, claim you went to Poland and find pics of polish tourism, resize, crop, insert fake recent metadata and post them somewhere. <br /><br />Advanced LE frustration: Create a honeypot VPS completely anonymously full of IDS, ssh into it through Tor and go on IRC with that IP address. See if any agents are trying to track you down, set the VPS to email you encrypted updates to a Tormail account or nym mixmaster server posting to alt.anonymous.messages. If anybody in IRC says &quot;U done goofed, I backtraced you!&quot; pretend to panic and log off, desperately claiming you are using anonymous wifi. Watch the honeypot do it&#039;s magic. <br /><br />Total netwar: Fill your honeypot server with malware bots purchased from hacker forums to infect the people coming after you, so you can watch the watchers. A hacker did this once and tracked all the FBI informants after him by logging into their exploited desktops and found they were using screen capture software and had FBI templates lying around with informant updates. The forum he ran also gave him their passwords in the clear, so he could go access their email accounts if they reused passwords and spy on them there too. Anybody he suspected as being an informant he would side channel attack with email links &quot;Hey, check out my awesome stash of cards do you want any free they&#039;re about to expire?&quot;. Just get non patched exploits from bugtraq and other lists, or buy them on hack forums. Load up a virtual machine and change it&#039;s signature so anti virus doesn&#039;t detect. You learn how to do this in the Metasploit 2011 e-book. <br /><br />Surprised nobody offers this service here, lot&#039;s of vendors would pay for it just to create a circle trace that leads to nowhere.

				They already do a good job of wasting their own resources look at TFM bust, 2 year investigation and who knows how many millions spent to arrest some hippies. Apparently they are now bribing Sinaloa cartel to give them info on rivals and to surrender serving minor sentences and witness protection. Moral of that story is be as violent and most terrorist as possible then they negotiate with you instead of jail
