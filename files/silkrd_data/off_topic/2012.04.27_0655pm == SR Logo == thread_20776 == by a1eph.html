				I believe we do have one lying around somewhere, best people to ask would be DPR and or one of the geeks. What would you be using it for just out of interest?<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=126d586b7635292f1163ad9993d00a27.jpg

				I noticed there were items like SR shirts up which I think are cute, I think it would be neat to possibly look into other items people may be interested in like grinders for example, maybe even other types of clothing like hats. Nothing that screams publicity but just some personal vanity for SR users.<br /><br />I myself make hand-made personal electronic vapourizers and was considering listing them on SR, however they are quite plain looking and would look neat with the camel on it.

				A hat, I would buy. And maybe a watch or something.<br /><br />A STASH WATCH WITH THE SR LOGO.<br /><br />Please? Someone? Anyone?

				The logo is actually publicly available clipart; SR just cut out the background and tinted it green. I found this a few months ago and was able to replicate the logo exactly using photoshop (I don&#039;t have the file anymore).<br /><br />http://www.fundraw.com/clipart/clip-art/4877/Man-on-Camel/

				Using the image linked by Tryptamine, I made a quick attempt in Photoshop.&nbsp; I tried to match the colors perfectly, but the tiny version is so pixelated, it may be off a bit.&nbsp; I saved it as an extremely high-res PNG, and everyone is free to use or alter it however they want.&nbsp; I went ahead and left the shadow in, since I think it looks better, but I can take it out.<br /><br />Here: xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=8cc6c2622221574db29fdc42db87513e.png
