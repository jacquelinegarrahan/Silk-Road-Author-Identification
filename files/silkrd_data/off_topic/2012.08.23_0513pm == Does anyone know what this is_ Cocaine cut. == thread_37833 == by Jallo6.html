				Has anyone ever saw the stuf they sell at some head shops that is supposed to be used as cocaine cut and it is like really shiney flakes.&nbsp; It is almost a waxey feeling and some places sell it in chunks and some as shake.<br /><br />When it is in chunk form it breaks down very easily in your hand.&nbsp; ie its not hard like chunk cocaine.<br /><br /><br />I know its hard from my description but if anyone has ever saw it before they will know what I am talking about.<br /><br /><br />Anyone know the chemical name for this?<br /><br /><br />Much thanks

				No, but thats really fucked! Is it psychoactive or inert? Is it marketed as cut or something innocent like &quot;incense&quot;?

				I have saw it marked as incense and room oderizer.&nbsp; it is inert.&nbsp; It has no smell or taste.<br /><br />It is really good to use at cocaine cut because when you use it and press the coke it makes the coke have layers like good fish scale and be really shiney.<br /><br />i have saw a head shop that had big cardboard barrels of it.<br /><br />I will try to post a pic later.

				It&#039;s likely just an unknown mixture of cutting agents. My friend has seen this before in different shops in different cities. The mix probably varies widely.

				I have seen a version of this at an adult movie store in the south east that had some sort of numbing agent added to mimic cokes analgesic property. If I remember correctly, it was some sort of Lidocaine additive or Novocaine. I dunno now.<br /><br />Romi

				How does it smell? <br />The &quot;&quot;stuff&quot;&quot; i know are shine crystals too, but have even the same smell as coke does.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t like to advertise cutting materials.<br /><br />Are you sure about the flakes.<br />&nbsp;Are they not crystals in the shape of small needles?<br />More or less flat but smaller and all in the very same shame shape.<br /><br />wasta<br />
