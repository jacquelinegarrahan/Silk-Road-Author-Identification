				Do business there at you&#039;re own risk, the place is full of scammers thats why only trust people with high transaction count. It doesn&#039;t have anything like escrow hence you can get scammed easily

Get your facts straight.<br />You are right about the scammers though. The place is infested with them. But you can do good business there if you use your brain.<br />I buy my weed there and I sell Moxy and 2C-P and I&#039;ve never been scammed.

				I&#039;ve heard mostly bad things about it. Ballzinator&#039;s post is about the most positive I&#039;ve seen regarding BMR.<br /><br />The place just looks like a place for scammers. I would only go and buy something there if it&#039;s something not offered on SR and the person has a good reputation.

You have to be careful. But then again, you have to be careful even on eBay. All of Onionland is a haven for scammers, SR being the only exception I know :)

I&#039;m pretty sure there&#039;s an easy way to give yourself feedback on BMR from a bunk account.
