				Hey Guys,<br /><br />Just a heads up for if you deal with Juergen.<br /><br />i ordered from him on XXXXX and paid for tracking, i waited for over a week for him to reply to my PM&#039;s about giving me a tracking number.<br />He started saying that he is away from home and his idiot worker(his words not mine) doesn&#039;t know how to use PGP and i had to wait a few more days.<br />a few more days later i tried contacting him again and he still hasn&#039;t responded. <br />i FE&#039;d so SR can not help.<br /><br />I sent him a PM asking for a reship or refund but but he reads my emails and never replies.<br /><br />i am not the only one who has been scammed by him. because of him i am now hesitant to FE for any Vendor no matter what their rating is, i&#039;m probably going to miss out on some good drugs because of this but hey, atleast ill have my own money.<br /><br />Have any other Aussies been in the same boat with this fuck wit?

				I&#039;m yet to decide for sure whether I&#039;ve been fucked.<br /><br />Will update this post within a week depending on what happens with my situation.<br /><br />Update: For the record the 50% reship did arrive.<br /><br />I still believe (even more so now) that the original was never sent.<br /><br />Still, it seems that the squeaky wheel gets the reship.
