				Anybody want to do a trade? I&#039;ll list my pit bull for an OZ of bud, 8ball of yay, whatever. Let&#039;s make a deal!<br /><br />KIDDING. Wouldnt trade this mutt for all the coin in the world.<br /><br />A little drunk and pooch is snoring next to me as I browse forums. Just had a thought wondering what types of pet people SR members are?<br /><br />Dog people? Cat people ? Then again, I could see some far out pet owners around these parts.....tarantulas, horny toads, tapirs, gila monsters?!<br /><br />Or is SR mostly just weirdo loners in dark basements smoking the drugs to get the stoned?<br /><br />My 4 legged son particularly enjoyed Anarcho&#039;s NY Diesel group buy from a hot minute ago.&nbsp; &quot;Dis tastes so goods Dads!&quot; - him, verbatim

				Have two dogs. One maltest, one yorky. They&#039;re pretty boring, just lay around and do nothing all day, but the maltese is really sweet so I don&#039;t mind them. I&#039;d rather have a bigger dog like a shep, dobreman, or a husky, but little dogs are nice sometimes too.

				definitely a dog person <br />Any animal that can make a human wash,clean feed and change it&#039;s litter is a lazy waste of fur at least a dog will bark when someone knocks or breaks in your house the Cat lays there and wants them to pet it before it will help the thief steal your TV and Computer

				I think the best pet in the world would be a fox. This sounds mad but there&#039;s an experiment that the russians have been doing every year for over 50 years by breeding the silver fox. After a few years some became used to humans and friendly. When bred with another friendly one you got a good littler. Within 6 generations (6 years) they were begining to change and soon after they changed color,size.. everything. The thing is with a fox, It&#039;s got more attitude than a cat and can look after itself, but also as loyal as a dog but not as reliant on you as a dog is. It&#039;s win win and how cool would it be have a fox as a side kick :P

				I love dogs, but too lazy to have one.<br /><br />I got a yellow small scorpion in a cemetery at once but it escaped just two days after. I&#039;m thinking to get a new one. Totally sure someone on silkroad would love to buy its poison. Is there some safe way to extract it?<br /><br />This kind is very common in cerrado (a kind of savanna in the middle of Brazil) and fucking dangerous.

				Despite having a very large dog that will hurl himself at the door if someone dares to try to open it, our first line of defense is one of our feral cats. If he hears the slightest noise at a window or the door he will fly into my comp room and hide behind the desk, or under the bed. Great cat. If he is calm, so am I.
