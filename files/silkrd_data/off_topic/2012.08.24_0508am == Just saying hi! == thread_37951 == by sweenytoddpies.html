				I am a new user and just wanted to say hi!<br /><br />The wiki says it is a good idea to post in the forum before attempting to buy, which makes sense. I&#039;d love it if anyone had any recommendations on which vendors are open to new buyers.<br /><br />I also plan to nab a couple cool digital purchases as my first buys. Some of them look kind of cool, and this is another recommended practice. Can anyone speak to whether this actually helps?<br /><br />Anyhow, just wanted to get started in this community! Looks really awesome and I can&#039;t wait to form great market relationships :D

				Welcome. What are you in the market for?<br /><br />Digital purchases are sometimes awesome. warweed or DrawkwarD both have them in abundance. :)

				To begin with I&#039;d like to get some nice, sticky bud. I&#039;m also a big fan of acid, so if this works out I&#039;d love to buy that semi-regularly as well!<br /><br />Thanks for the tip, I will check out those vendors

Feel free to try em out though. :D<br /><br />ALWAYS read reviews my man. Always. If recent feedback seems even a little shady, find someone else to buy from. Check the rumor mill for review threads. Read, read, read. Never go out of escrow. If a seller demands it, tell em to piss off and find a seller who isnt a penis.&nbsp;

				Hey man, welcome aboard.<br /><br />Seeing as you mentioned Lucy I just wanted to say this before you get burnt. Look at all the feedback for the vendor you&#039;re interested in, check the Rumor Mill sub section of the forum for the vendor&#039;s thread, as well as doing a search in the other areas, and start small (don&#039;t go in for a sheet to begin with.) Lucy seems to be so sought after here that scammers tend to use it to their advantage. People go absolutely ape shit when a new vendor with good prices comes up, but the number of times this has turned bad is amazing. Check out Kat and GummyStars for examples of what I mean here (a lot of reading, but hey, at least you know what to look for.)<br /><br />As for general advice, all I can say is this: Lurk on these forums, lurk on these forums and lurk on these forums. When you think you&#039;ve done enough lurking, come back and lurk some more :P The information you can pick up here even without posting is amazing.<br /><br />Finally, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Words to live by here on the road.

				hey mate, welcome. another tip is start low - because you are new you will probably have to FE (finalize early) there&#039;s just no getting round that usually - this means you pay before they send and it leaves you wide open to get scammed. so start low, just buy a gram or 2 here and there, so if you do get robbed there&#039;s not much of a loss. once you have a few of these under your belt you will be able to stay in escrow - once you are able to use escrow ALWAYS use it - once you have enough purchases there is no reason for anyone not to trust you so you can use the safety net like everyone else<br /><br />other than that enjoy! i still feel like a kid in a fucked up sweet shop whenever i log in :D

				Thanks for all the replies everyone!<br /><br />It makes sense that vendors will want me to &quot;FE&quot; at first, so I will definitely get just 1 or 2 grams to begin with. Great tip<br /><br />Spunkaroo definitely scared me off the Lucy idea...for now. There really aren&#039;t any vendors that have been consistently able to deliver?<br /><br />I used to live in a city where I could get great acid for great prices--ALL THE TIME! But now I am in a new city, don&#039;t have connections, and get the sense that the acid market here is just bunk. So honestly, I&#039;m pretty disappointed that it sounds like it can be the same way on the Silk Road. Is this because feds are chasing down acid dealers or something? Just curious

				Hello.<br /><br />Check my sig for some recommendations. For an idea, I didn&#039;t buy any e-items and I made my first five or so purchases without FE. Just bought small quantities of the shit I wanted. <br /><br />So...there ya go. Lots of good vendors left who will sell to newbies(or they did to me). <br /><br /><br />Cheers. Now go get fucked up.

				Don&#039;t let me scare you off it man, I&#039;ve had success in the past. All I&#039;m saying is be extra careful because the risk seems to be higher. If you go with someone who has flawless feedback, has been consistently around for a while and has forum feedback to back them up you shouldn&#039;t have an issue.
