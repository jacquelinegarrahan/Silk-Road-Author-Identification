				I will be trying Changa (1/3 DMT) for the first time in a few days.<br />What is a good dose to start off? Note this is my first time with DMT as well, not just Changa.<br />Also, I can just use a glass pipe for the changa, right? I dont have to order no vapor pipe?<br /><br />

				As I understand the harmala does not decrease the amount of DMT you need, it just extends and adds character to the trip.<br /><br />If you need 50 to 60 mg for a breakthrough on pure DMT (which you should), then you need 150 mg to 180 mg of changa.<br /><br />I am in the exact same boat as you. I bought 1/3 DMT containing changa and I have never tried pure DMT. I have been unable to break through because the vapor genie knock off I bought is a piece of shit.<br /><br />I did try smoking the changa straight and it did work, but it was very harsh. I don&#039;t think that actually burning the leaves is ideal but I haven&#039;t read any reports of it not working.

				Most changa has an MAOI infused into the leaves and the leaves themselves are often a very weak MAOI or not an MAOI at all. People definitely vape it and have full blown effects. They say vaping is ideal.

				Also, I am not sure if I am reading you correctly but no, DMT can definitely be smoked without MAO inhibition.

				I&#039;ll invest in a vaporizer in the future, but for now can I smoke the Changa I&#039;ll be receiving from a regular bong?&nbsp;

				Yeah. I am not an expert but you don&#039;t want to hold flame to bowl the whole time. You start a cherry and slowly spread it on the inhale.

				Did you break through man?<br /><br />I tried for the first time but was stricken after a couple hits with a sense of unbearable dread. I ended up having a near death experience.
