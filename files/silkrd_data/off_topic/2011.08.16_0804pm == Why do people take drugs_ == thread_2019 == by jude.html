				Some people take drugs because they have some sort of chemical imbalance. Opiates are great for depression. Some psychiatrists prescribe opiates for this. Usually for extreme situations. I know i feel a lot better emotionally when I take opiates, not only does it help my pain, it helps my mood. I have heard other theories on other drugs as well. I think most drug users are just self medicating. Im just throwing a theory out there. Everyone is different.

				The first time I took drugs they were prescribed to me and they made me feel fucking good. I was so naive back then I didn&#039;t even realize that that feeling was being high! God, it was so good. They were my &quot;day fixers,&quot; my escape.<br /><br />Been chasing that first high ever since....

				I grew up in the Nancy Reagan &#039;just say no&#039; era and I wanted to judge for myself what the hype was all about. I tried smoking weed and it was nothing like I was led to believe. So I tried other drugs as they became available. I still like to try non opiates that I haven&#039;t tried whenever I can. SR has been great in this capacity. Opiates scare me. I want to take drugs to feel good or experience life through a different lens than my everyday, not because I will have withdrawals if I don&#039;t. No disrespect for any opiate users, but that stuff just isn&#039;t for me. So yea to answer your question it was 1. curiosity then 2. mind expanding exploration.

				for me theres many reasons, i failed at all my dreams and life certainly didnt turn out the way i wanted at all, so an escape from it sure is nice, but mainly its curiosity, for all those years as a kid you were told of the horrors of drugs and the untold damage the would do to you &quot;one line of cocaine and youre hooked FOREVER&quot; and the like, then i tried one and found out id been lied to rather heavily by a lot of the people i was led to believe i should trust and at that point i decided to make up my own mind, i do have a list of substances to try before i die and thanks to sr im ticking them off faster than ever, never really had an addiction though unless you count the ciggies and the coffee<br /><br />now weed is a bit different, i love weed more than almost anything else on this planet, its not just the high, its the smells, its the flavours and all that goes with it, i regularly visit holland, while there many of my friends buy these big deals where you get say 5g for a cheaper price and they all call me a fool for buying single grams but while the choice is there i like to taste as many as i can, i dont go to holland to just get stoned, i can get stoned at home, i go for the variety<br /><br />other than that i guess its all escapism, as i said life has never really been that good to me, and i spend all week busting my ass at work so i guess my drugs are my personal reward for that, some people collect porcelain figurines, some people spend hundreds of pounds on a haircut, i spend my disposable income on my drugs, but i love it when the people who do the previous things i mentioned call me an idiot for taking drugs, ive experienced feelings they will never even be able to comprehend and will likely miss out on all together, not to mention that some drugs have brought me infinitely closer to some of my friends and brought me new ones too, i personally found 4-mmc to be arguably the greatest social setting substance ever, me and my friends talked about things we never would have opened up about to each other before, some of the most amazing moments of my life have been down to drugs, some people call me a fool for it and tell me im wasting my life, well you know what, id rather live 50 interesting years than 100 boring ones and i can be pretty sure that on that day when i lay dying in my hospital bed i shall have no regrets about the way ive lived my life. but thats not to say that all this will shorten your life, shulgin is 86 and still going, hoffman went to 102 and i once remember a quote from a man who was at the time either the oldest in the world or the uk when they asked his secret to long life, he said &quot;a cigarette, a whiskey and a flutter on the horses every day&quot;<br /><br />also these days aside from my trips to holland i dont really go on holidays anymore, my friends all save up and spend a few grand a year on a holiday to some exotic location somewhere, dont get me wrong ive traveled a fair bit in my time but ive often felt like ive had a holiday just from a nice shroom trip and it doesnt cost me several thousand pounds and leave me with some awful illness for the two weeks after i come back, a few years ago some of my friends went to thailand and kept badgering me to go, i didnt as i knew what would happen, id go there, get off the plane and feel hungry, eat something and end up sick for the rest of the time im there (for some reason i pretty much always get sick from eating abroad) not to mention all the other potential pitfalls than can turn what seemed like a great way to spend 2k into one of the biggest nightmares of your life, sure you could have a nightmare acid trip, but at least it only cost you 20 quid or so<br /><br />as a final note, why someone takes drugs is an easy question with a million answers but the other side of the coin i find is things like what someone gets out of spending say £100 on a plate with a specific design to add to their collection of other similar plates, or thousands on fitness equipment to craft that ultra endurance perfect body, which is of course very useful to someone who works behind a desk in a city office, hell i cant count the times ive needed to chase down a deer for my dinner and kill it bare handed after getting off the bus on my housing estate<br /><br />wow that was a monster of a post and im not entirely sure it makes all the sense in the world but it probably at least proves to a point that that ritalin i snorted a bit ago is having some effect, but more on that in the rumourmill later

				I take drugs for a few reasons.&nbsp; Simple pleasure is one.&nbsp; Opiates are my main bag, and on a nice dose, I feel like I&#039;m wrapped in a warm, cozy blanket while getting a deep brain massage by a darkly beautiful seductress.&nbsp; She&#039;s unforgiving and downright vicious when I don&#039;t respect her, though, which forces me to respect the boundaries and use my discretion.<br /><br />In another respect, opiates and some stimulants allow me to accomplish incredible amounts of work and establish/maintain my focus.&nbsp; Complex problems become so much easier to break down, normally tedious tasks become a piece of cake.&nbsp; I have a sense of total control over everything when on them, and that feeling of power acts as a great reinforcement of my skills.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done some amazing things while under the influence, and I can proudly look back and admire my accomplishments and know that I&#039;ve done something truly marvelous.<br /><br />While this is all well and good, there is an element of emotional pain control / escapism there that I absolutely cannot deny.&nbsp; While life has been very good to me over the past few years, I wish I had done a lot of things differently in my younger years, and I&#039;m at a stage in life where there is no going back on those choices (or going back would cause severely negative consequences.)&nbsp; The drugs help, but I&#039;m not naive enough to think that they really offer any REAL assistance in that department - they just help to delay the feelings of regret and want.&nbsp; <br /><br />Overall, my willpower remains strong after several years of use, and I feel as though I&#039;m USUALLY on top of my usage.&nbsp; I think the key for me has been to place huge restrictions and barriers on how I can make the drugs available to myself.&nbsp; Limits to me are everything in this game I so much enjoy playing.

				At first it was to enhance life or out of boredom.&nbsp; Been smoking pot for over 15 years, daily.&nbsp; Experimented with all kinds of drugs in college.&nbsp; Always liked hallucinogens the best.&nbsp; Had a bout of coke addiction.&nbsp; Ended up being diagnosed with anxiety and depression.&nbsp; Was put on a SSNRI and benzos.&nbsp; Started taking shit loads of klonopin and ativan a day, and become totally whacked out.&nbsp; Quit that shit after much struggle.&nbsp; I pretty much daily medicate myself on weed but it has worked for a long time.&nbsp; Will not touch benzos again they are evil.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do coke anymore.&nbsp; Take LSD, Shrooms, and/or MDMA about once a month to release the inner beasts I suppose or enjoy a music festival.&nbsp;

				I take drugs for their medicinal properties, mostly. I have an eating disorder, so I take a lot of diet pills, some illegal and some not. I am going to start going on SSRIs soon because of anxiety.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really take drugs for &quot;fun,&quot; ie recreationally, although I always appreciate the altered states I get from codeine or ephedra or whatever.

				Seriously, though, the answer for me depends on the drug.<br /><br />Cannabis - I enjoy the way my mind works differently when high.&nbsp; It also enhances my mood and calms my anxiety which is relatively mild but can be a problem.&nbsp; I also enjoy the body sensations and how amazing it makes food taste.&nbsp; Like Seth Rogan says in &quot;Pineapple Express,&quot; weed makes EVERYTHING better.&nbsp; It makes movies better, walks in the park better...it makes sex even BETTER!<br /><br />LSD, Mushrooms, and MDMA - The first times were to experiment.&nbsp; Then I realized how much use these substances have for therapeutic/introspective potential.&nbsp; I take these drugs to understand myself, the world, and others better.&nbsp; Like cannabis, these make my mind work differently which allows me to see things from a perspective that is difficult when my consciousness is unaltered.&nbsp; By chemically altering my ego, I feel I see things that I may have been avoiding due to fear, anxiety, ignorance, pride, etc.&nbsp; I also love music, art, and lights which all become spectacular with these drugs.

				As a living human, I (and hopefully you too) engage in actions which alter the behavior of neurotransmitters (or other structures) in the brain. The behavior of these neurotransmitters is hard-linked to my experience of existing - when they change, it changes.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />Eating cakes<br />Running on a stationary motirized rubber belt for 30 minutes at a time<br />Talking to people<br />Falling asleep<br />Doing boring tasks<br />Driving<br />Stubbing my toe<br />Anything and everything else<br /><br />Some of these activities result in neurochemical changes which &quot;feel&quot; positive, some negative. Most are generally neutral. I am hard wired to want more positive / interesting and less negative / boring.<br /><br /><br />In the last several years, I found some new actions which can be classed under &quot;ingesting [drug]&quot;. To my satisfaction, I found that many of these actions &quot;felt&quot; much more positive and interesting than anything I had ever found before - and I thought I already knew about a lot of positive actions to begin with. Bonus!<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />Ingesting MDMA<br />Ingesting LSD<br />Ingesting psilocybin<br />Ingesting 2c-b<br />Etc<br />Etc<br />Etc<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s as simple as that.<br /><br />No escapism, no &quot;fleeing&quot; from &quot;reality&quot; - just more actions which produce good / interesting feelings. Life is a flow of feelings. Skillful drug use gives you a &quot;better&quot; flow of feelings.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to make mistakes and end up with a negative sum total, though, so I am always on guard.<br />

				Well, I am addicted to Meth, but there are times when I don&#039;t have it for weeks, and I&#039;m alright. I still go to work 5 days a week, and while I do crave it alot, I can go without.<br /><br />However, I started using because I groom dogs for a living. As you may or may not know, my job requires a MASSIVE amount of physical labor, energy, and pep. I have to kiss every clients ass every day and make them happy, I have to lift big dogs into the tub, I work my ass off every day and still appear to be happy and energetic. Meth provides everything I need to accomplish that, and makes every day so much easier. Without Meth, I&#039;m able to work, but sometimes I&#039;m a little slower, or I may not be as thorough, but my efforts are passable.<br /><br />I also just like having the energy to take care of my dogs I have at home and clean my house and my yard.

So anyway, THAT&#039;S why I use drugs. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Have you looked into substituting the meth with another less addictive drug?

				I started taking drugs just as an experiment but I dont want the drugs to run my life, just enhance my experience of it :) I am proud to say that my first drug buy was from SR and my first few trips on LSD/Cannabis were awesome (been looking for that high ever since).<br /><br />I too have a regular well paying day job so i dont even want to try any addictive drugs like meth/heroin just because of their addiction potential. I however have tried DMT, mescaline, LSD and weed of course.<br /><br />Long live SR!

				To love others. I have a bipolarity disorder and I always hated shrinks, so I coudn&#039;t love no one until I tried LSD and weed. Now truly love others and I&#039;m working in one day not need to use drugs for that.<br /><br />Drugs help sick people, sad people, all kinds of people. But you need to know what drugs to use and how to use it.<br /><br />Peace and Love.

				many reasons really, i&#039;m a tech square head aka c++ systems engineer / software architect. i need a way to turn brain off once in a while, and put my OCD under control. weed really helps with that.<br /><br />i also am under a ton of stress due to job and being the only provider for the household (my better half takes care of our wonderful kids and the house) so opiates once in a while help to take the edge off. plus i&#039;ve never programed this good like i do after few vicodines or a roxy :)<br /><br />also, my whole life i&#039;ve been a good boy. and lately i realized that i&#039;ve been lied to about drugs, and that i&#039;m totally ignorant of their effects. it started with a joint from my manager at work. then quickly moved onto roxy, but not too much. i&#039;m affraid of addiction so i keep it to few every month or so. i&#039;ve knows the effects of vicodine for years, due to inheriting shit for teeth and needing many root canals...<br /><br />anyways, not i mostly do weed to sleep better and/or relax, and opiates if i want to stay up late and be productive while really enjoying myself.<br /><br />oh and nothing beats a joint few hours after taking a roxy, once the pill starts wearing off. OMG what a pleasant high :D

				I used to do drugs to self medicate/escape, then I used cause I was addicted, but after taking an extended sober break (four months, whoo) I started smoking weed and doing softcore drugs again on a semi-regular basis because I really do think it enhances the quality of my life. <br /><br />Weed is special to me because it&#039;s the only thing that helps with my APD. I feel okay about myself and everyone else while still being functional. I can actually hold a conversation with someone at a party or other public place without being really fearful or obnoxiously nervous (which causes me to stutter/confuse words sometimes and that&#039;s embarrassing). I wouldn&#039;t say weed makes me normal, but it makes me feel really comfortable with other people and myself.
