				I had a Dry Tobacco snuff phase at one point as well.&nbsp; I got this little contraption that looks like a cross between a catapult and a gun for shooting stuff into your nostril (lock it, load it, put it up to your nose and pull the trigger). it work really well for substances that you want to absorb through your mucus membrane without actually snorting it beyond the nasal barrier. And, it is always a conversation piece.

				It is a miniscule ammount (1-10mg). But for most PURE chemicals that people would want to snort, that&#039;s all you really want to take at once and then just redose as needed.
