				Got back into gaming recently after literally 10 years of not being arsed with it. Got Assassin&#039;s Creed 1/Brotherhood/Revelations, and Skyrim. Just bought the other AC that I haven&#039;t played and pre-ordered AC 3 (looks the TITS) and waiting for the Skyrim patch to come out on PS3. <br /><br />Anyway I need some ideas for other games. I generally like games with depth in and decent story. Not massively into things like First-Person Shooters and things like that unless they are flat out amazing. Action/Adventure and RPGs seem to be my thing really. Graphics have to be very decent and I can&#039;t stand cheesy games so none of that shit. I used to play Final Fantasy on the PS1 (7/8/9) so I may buy the ones for the PS3 if they are decent if anyone can comment on that it would be helpful. <br /><br />DISCUSS!

				My favorite has been the Uncharted series.&nbsp; High production value.<br /><br />I am, however, partial to the 1st person shooters.

				You could buy the new DLC for skyrim.I havent bought it yet but I probably will when I get paid.Its called Downguard or something like that its supposed to be like a whole new main story line.Like the first main quest with alduin and all that.Its supposed to be some cray vampire trying to block out the sun or some shit so vampires can rule.And you dont really sound like you like shooter games but battlefield 3s main story line had to be the sickest story line EVER.You got to like fly in jets and it was really interactive like you had to do the system checks and everything before takeoff and use tanks and all types of shit and you actually have to use tools/blowtorch to fix your humvees and shit if its been shot its was my personal fave story line of all times I played the whole story line which is extremely long ( took about 24 hours each time) like 3 times all the way through.But uh some other suggestions would be like call of duty MW3,and of the AC games,portal two is pretty fun when youre high,fable 3,and I cant wait for black ops 2 to come out haha.

				I was going to suggest assasins creed and skyrim, given the breadth and depth of skyrim i dont reckon you will need many other games for a while, however as mentioned the Uncharted series are probably the best PS3 exclusive games.<br /><br />If you like zombie games Dead Island or Left 4 Dead are worth checking out.<br /><br />Batman Arkham Asylum and Batman Arkhan City are both great games.<br /><br />The mass effect series is highly rated but i only played the first one which was good.<br /><br />If you dont like FPS then of all if them Battlefield 3 is probably the best given the online play.<br /><br />

				I reckon I wana give the Uncharted series bash to be fair because I have smashed Skyrim now and done all the Creeds as well apart from Brotherhood. <br /><br />I do like Zombie games so I may crack out the Resident Evil series, used to be all over them back in the day. Any comments on the PS3 Final Fantasies?

				Resident Evil series is OK but if you want co-op survival Dead Island and L4D are unbeatable.<br /><br />Not played FF on PS so can&#039;t comment I&#039;m sorry.<br /><br />Check out metacritic.com and the PS3 highest rated games, i akways find it worth a look, especially to identify older games i may have missed.

				Only games I&#039;ve played recently are Deus Ex Human Revolution and Mass Effect 3. Both are shooty though, but I enjoyed them for their story lines. There was quite a bit of disappointment with ME&#039;s ending though.

				Hey Lim,<br />Bethesada will be releasing Dishonoured soon - looks like its going to be a killere game - very steampunk feel to it.<br />The Max Payne series has to be some of my favourite games ever published,<br />Other than that I would suggest,<br /><br />Bioshock (1) - beautiful graphics and truly brilliant story line.<br />Fallout 3 - class class class class!!!<br />Clive Barkers Jericho - brilliant fuckud up game - crazy weapons and abilities and as fucked up as only Clive Barker can be. ( Zombie roman legionaires, <br />nazi witches and bullets you can control once fired - 6 head shots in a row! )<br />

				Just spoke to a friend with a PS3 (i play on xbox) he suggested:<br /><br />GTA IV - this is a great game and will be cheap to pick up secondhand, plus GTA V is out this year so will serve as a good warmup to the main event.<br /><br />Little Big Planet - PS3 exclusive<br /><br />Red Dead Redemption- like GTA but set in the wild west, ride horses, steal trains, rob stagecoaches, lasso horses and people, great immersive game with a huge map, not quite Skyrim but good nobe the less.<br /><br />God of War III - PS3 exclusive

				I&#039;m not much of a gamer these days and like you have had a long break but recently I discovered the Mass Effect trilogy, I will echo the recommendations of others, it is epic. Amazingly well produced, very engaging, kind of game that gets me out of bed at 6am to have a quick play.<br /><br />Another I enjoyed was Fallout 3; initially I found it a little boring but the story drags you in. It required a few mods to make it to my liking bot once it was setup right it was a joy to play.<br /><br />Those are two of the best games I&#039;ve played in years, some others faves of mine are Crysis 1 &amp; 2, Just Cause 2, Modern Warfare 3, rFactor, Super Meat Boy, Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 (buggy) and Counter Strike Source (oldie).
