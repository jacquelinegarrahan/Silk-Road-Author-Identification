				In less than 24 hours I will have my very own volcano classic, not digital. I finally found someone on Craigslist that has one, and get this for 275$!! Can&#039;t beat that or say no to it. Me as a heavy cannabis user, am VERY excited for this. I have never used one, but the reviews speak for themselves. Not to mention that he is going to let me try it out first. Any comments, first hand experiences with the volcano, or persuasions either way are appreciated. <br /><br />W00T!<br /><br />

				I have read a good bit about vaporizers. From what I have seen, you can&#039;t exactly go wrong with a volcano. Tried and proven. The only thing that is steep is the price but your not paying full price anyways! Honestly, a volcano is a vaporizer that any enthusiast would use so its not a bad addition to the collection. The only downside to a volcano is that your limited to the bag. I&#039;m trying to figure out what vaporizer to get but I want something that I can use in America and Europe and it seems like no vaporizers can without a transformer :(

A lot of people say the digital isn&#039;t necessary either because you get a feel for it and find the right spot on the dial and it&#039;s fine.

				Shit thanks guys, sorry it took me a while to get back. I&#039;ve been busy, I ended up finding a digital one with 4 years left on the warranty for only 300$, and it&#039;s everything in a vaporizer that I feel was lacking in every other one I have found. It&#039;s like I&#039;m actually hitting vapor, not smoking, and it gets me high as fuck! I ordered an oz of shake from KindBud and it was str8 fire and smokes amazingly well out of the volcano. I wouldn&#039;t advise paying 850 for the set like the jackass I bought it from. <br /><br />Now my girl can&#039;t bitch at me, cause she always said that thc isn&#039;t bad for you just the act of smoking. She just never thought I&#039;d fork out the $$ for the Volcano, lol. <br /><br />

				You will not regret that purchase, It has been my most favorite device EVER. So worth it in conservation and saving TONS of weed. also gives you the opportunity to really really really taste the flavor of the bud. Just take a wiff of ur bud and that is what its going to taste like.

				Digital owner here and EXTREMELY happy. Didn&#039;t think digital was necessary but (buying new) thought why not, and now would not choose differently given how perfect it is for spice as well as bud.<br /><br />Excellent purchase, my man. Get a box of spare bags and off you go.

				Very happy for you sir and I highly recommend the volcano to anyone. I&#039;ve had my classic easy valve for about 7 years now and its been a true champ, always delivering awesome vapor. The conservation aspect of it is awesome !! you use so little. I&#039;ve never had a single problem with it and it paid for itself after 1-2 months!<br /><br />I keep it in a nice camera case(double side velcro), so I can easily bring it with me places.<br /><br />I&#039;ve recently considered purchasing Storz &amp; Bickel&#039;s new vaporizer, the PLENTY, for the whip aspect of it and not having to wait for it to warm up. My only complaint with the volcano is it can take maybe 8 minutes to warm up. But can I really complain?? <br /><br />So often I find myself completely stoned sitting there with only my 2nd bag next to me half used- whoa! <br /><br />Even today the Volcano is still the champ, although some of these portable hash pens definitely give it a run for its money..... but they can be a finicky or difficult to get the right oil. the volcano works every time!<br /><br />happy toking...&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

				I&#039;m glad no one here is laying on that whole &quot;old technology&quot; bullshit on the &#039;cano, cause whatever. What works, works, and it works damn well. Love the bags.

				I&#039;ve owned a volcano digit for about 5&nbsp; years.&nbsp; I enjoyed quite a bit for a long time, but like one of the other commenters in this thread, eventually it started giving me problems with my lungs.&nbsp; Chest just felt super tight and I started wheezing.&nbsp; I do kind of have asthma but the only thing that sets it off is smoking weed.&nbsp; For some reason though it seems easier to me to cough out tar than the stick vapor substance.&nbsp; Or maybe it was just that I accumulated so much more because the vapo allowed me to smoke for much longer without a break.<br /><br />I have also used it for DMT and do highly recommend.&nbsp; Just make sure you put some herbs underneath or it can melt all over the heating element and is a bitch to clean.<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy!

				What do you guys do with the brown crumble left over after vaping? I always regret throwing it out, because although it&#039;s devoid of THC, it&#039;s still got other sweet, sweet cannabinoids.

				Hey congrats on the volcano! that&#039;s a great price!!<br /><br />I went to a headshop in CBD and the volcano vaporizer they had was $1000!! fucking rip!!<br /><br />that being said and to the people who are having trouble with &quot;portability&quot; or bags, I ended up buying a vaporizer pipe! its just like a pipe but its got filters on the top half. I chucked some weed in there and smoked it MAN THAT SHIT WAS NICE. hardly any smoke coming out but you can feel the THC in your mouth and hitting you. No need for water, or bags, or changing the filter or anything. it&#039;s absolutely beautiful<br /><br />FUCKING LOVELY STUFF. it was $85 from a headshop. could probably find it cheaper online.

				Sorry dude. A little late to the party, here. I&#039;ve owned a digit for (I forget how many) years. You are making a wise investment. I still smoke the occasional blunt and bowl, but I&#039;ve been a happy vap&#039;r for years now. You will not be disappointed unless he&#039;s mistreated it (dropping it is the only thing I can think of). Fuck the EZ Valve. Take a half hour to learn how to use a solid valve. I (at the recommendation of Storz&amp;Bickel) wash my valve parts in the dishwasher. They didn&#039;t suggest this part, but I like to soak them ISO for a half hour or so before I put them in. The valve comes out shiny and brand new. I would also suggest a second valve if you ever have an extra 50 bucks laying around. It&#039;s nice when you reup with some really good shit and you don&#039;t want to wait to clean the valve or use a super dirty valve. I&#039;m going to stop gushing on this thing, but I love mine. I have taken very good care of it and it has never had to be serviced.<br /><br />Now, for bags: I like the Volcano brand bags, but you can totally use a Turkey size oven bag from the grocery store. I don&#039;t like them because they are fat and you have to hold the valve while filling or it will fall off. They are MUCH quieter, though. If stealth is at all an issue, I&#039;d say go for the oven bags. They are made for cooking a turkey, so you don&#039;t really have to worry that you&#039;re inhaling plastic from the bag. That&#039;s about all I&#039;ve got. Oh, and I hope you like having company over because there will be plenty of it. Congrats, dude. Welcome to the club. Oh, also. For portability, Iolite is the bomb, although the Magic Flite Launch Box looks like it might be even better.<br /><br />To canuckboy: I bought my Volcano because I was dating a chick with asthma. The fact that she doesn&#039;t smoke could be a selling point for getting a vape. There are also plenty of other viable choices that are much cheaper. But the Volcano is DEFINITELY the Mercedes of vapes. It&#039;s even German.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D
