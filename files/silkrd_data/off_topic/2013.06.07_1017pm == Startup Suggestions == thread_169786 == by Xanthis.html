Nevermind this, then. I&#039;ll just edit the topic to center around suggestions on budgeted startups.

				Well the result of the implementation of vendor creation fees/bonds has been interesting.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been here since the road started, and at the beginning (before there were fees to become a vendor), certain products were much cheaper/more available, such as pharmaceutical amphetamines (Adderall, Dexedrine, etc).&nbsp; Before the change, there were plenty of &#039;vendors&#039;, who I assume were really just regular joes just selling their unused scripts, so you could get 30mg IRs for 3 or 4 bucks apiece.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; Expect to pay 3-5 times that, which is pretty obscene.&nbsp; On the flip side though, it seems there are fewer scammer vendors and &#039;pointless&#039; vendors (e.g. people who would just put up listings for nonsense to send out a message).

				As far as I&#039;m aware, this is the most well-known and populated black market anywhere on the internet, so I suppose if there&#039;s enough traffic coming through here and you&#039;re following all the standard common sense guidelines, it should pay for itself fairly quickly.<br /><br />

				If you build it, they will come!&nbsp; Just be prepared for business.&nbsp; If you&#039;re smart and know that the profit is in the volume, not the item then you&#039;re set to win!&nbsp; If you think that you&#039;re just going to tax the crap out of people, you will be in for a long and boring ride!&nbsp; I see people tax for all kinds of things...everything actually, but if you sell a little over cost then you help everyone out.&nbsp; You actually make more $$ if you sell for a smaller profit.&nbsp; This is hard for a lot of people to ponder because they only know how to rape people and have never really been successful at shit in life!&nbsp; Selling over priced drugs does not make you a drug dealer, moving 50 metric tons a month makes you a drug dealer!&nbsp; Who do you think makes more?&nbsp; Even if the latter only makes $1 profit off of each transaction!~!
