				Just about the only place in the Universe I can post this. So here it goes.<br /><br />Had LSD 8 hours ago, so, now, on the coming down.&nbsp; This LSD I had has Silk Road written all over it. A-mazing (this is an understatement and everybody who had LSD knows what I mean so I won&#039;t bother you with pointless descriptions). Thank you for your existence Silk Road. Thank you for allowing me to feel this for the first time in my life. I had no contacts and without Silk Road, this would not have been possible.<br /><br />I hope one day people will be wise enough to not endanger themselves with such substances, and use them wisely, just as I did tonight. I don&#039;t plan to repeat this too soon and I sure as hell won&#039;t become a junkie. <br /><br />Hopefully, one day, such amazing shortcuts will not be illegal any more. Because that&#039;s what these are. Shortcuts. Shortcuts to some areas of our brain which offer an amazing opportunity for self exploration and understanding.<br /><br />God, I just wish some of those people killing themselves for religious reasons would have some of this. God, I just wish some politicians would try this, but try it properly, and understanding something from it. The world would be a better place... or PALACE ;). <br /><br />Enough is enough.<br /><br />Thank you SR! Love you all :).

				Silk road is the most amazing gift the internet has provided me since my first taste of porn. <br /><br />Before I found silk road, my life was in shambles. Now that i&#039;ve found it, it&#039;s still in shambles but I am WAY happier about it. <br /><br />Thank you based silk road

				lesseroftwoweevils: I guess you are referring to the potential megalomania effect from LSD? I had none of that fortunately :).<br /><br />anonman88: I&#039;m quite new around here actually. The LSD was given to me by a a friend who got it from here. Obviously he&#039;s the main benefactor but without SR this would not have been possible. Now I&#039;m here too :). And, just as he gave me the stuff for free, so will I also share my first purchase with some close friends. Somebody who can properly appreciate it.<br /><br />I&#039;m very pro-active so whenever I buy something, I&#039;ll definitely review it for the good of the community. I don&#039;t intend to trip very often, but a few times per year, I think the brain could really use some gear shifting like I did last night :D. Puts things into better... perspective.
