				Yeah, you can&#039;t just &#039;get&#039; ketamine for your horse, you have to be a licensed veterinarian and they keep track of how many vials you receive at a time and how many you use, it&#039;s really strictly regulated.

An anesthetic and a benzodiazepine sounds suspiciously like something that could potentially stop you breathing. I&#039;ll definitely be steering clear of this one. <br /><br />I mean don&#039;t get me wrong if some clever kid could manufacture PURE Tiletamine and then maybe I&#039;d give it a go but that would be hard given the crack down in India/China on the Arylcyclohexylamine precursors as a whole that would be quite hard at the moment.

				I&#039;d be interested in bulk tiletamine crystal/powder, in Telazol preparation form, or even just a sample of any preparation of tiletamine that&#039;s not heavily cut or contaminated with K or MXE. It doesn&#039;t sound amazing on its own but it could be a terrific combo with K, MXE, 3-MeO-PCP, or 3-MeO-PCE. Or, with cocaine &amp; heroin in the same shot. Or with mephedrone in the same shot.
