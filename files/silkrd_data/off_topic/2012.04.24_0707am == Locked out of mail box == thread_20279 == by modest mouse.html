				this is one of those sad stories that doesnt really contribute much except for possibly someone being able to post some words of encouragement and boost my moral.<br /><br />everyone, please be grateful when your orders arrive today and that you are able to enjoy the contents. <br /><br />I have been patiently waiting for an order from fanny hill and its been over a week now, plus starting to expect my sale orders, but i am extremely frustrated because i cannot access my freaking mailbox! i lost my keys after checking my mail on 420 and now i am locked out since it is an apt mailbox... my roommate, who is the one actually on the lease is gone for another week. <br /><br />torn apart the house, been back to the only places i went multiple times to look. i thought about calling a locksmith. thought about leaving the postman a note to bring to my front door or to call the post office and ask them to hold my mail so i can come pick it up... i want to get into the box that bad. i dont know what else to do, cant even freaking get my roomie to mail me the key, lol. <br /><br />the only great thing was at least i was able to check my box on fri and delta11 came through with 2 day shipping of some delicious strains which totally made my holiday.<br /><br />anyone else with any frustrating situations like mine?

				You want to get in that bad, huh?<br /><br />Google &quot;lockpicking tutorial&quot; and find the type of lock it is. You can learn it in a few hours.

				i mean opiate withdrawal is a pretty fucking strong motivator if you know what i mean... i still have some of tonys but will be getting really desperate in a few days<br /><br />the lock picking is actually an interesting idea. i am up super late at night and the box isnt really visible unless you actually come to check your mail, so i may spend some time attempting to get in, though i doubt it is really that easy. plus i thought you needed special pointed tools to push the pins. i am somewhat clever, maybe i can find something to work.&nbsp; <br /><br />or just lock picks and have em mailed to me... oh wait, never thought i would care this much about being able to check my mail. <br /><br />would a locksmith open the mailbox? <br /><br />and unfortunately i am usually not around during the time mail is delivered or i would just sit there and read a book or something until he came to deliver and i would just grab all my mail when he opened the box.

				If you can show that you live there a locksmith should open the mailbox, otherwise buy a set of Bogota Entry Tools, you will have the lock open within 5 minutes.
