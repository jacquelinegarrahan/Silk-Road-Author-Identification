				This is just a general question for people on this forum as I know most of you may know what I&#039;m on about.<br />How many of you use drugs for self medication and what do you use and to treat what?<br />Currently I&#039;m not using anything (I&#039;ve moved 250 miles away from all my friends and trusted dealers and i know absolutely no one down here) But when I was living in the town I grew up in I used to smoke Cannabis and take multiple other things as a way of medicating my social anxiety and depression. Even though I have always been told that it will do the opposite it worked better than any prescribed medication that I was given. I used to take stimulants like speed and MDMA as it made me actually talk to people that I didn&#039;t know which usually sober me would run a marathon before even considering striking up a conversation. I smoked weed and took hallucinogens because it made me more relaxed and even more comfortable talking to people who I class as my best friends (there&#039;s only a few) Drugs helped me through a 4 year period that if I had been sober during that time without a doubt I wouldn&#039;t be here. However we are constantly bombarded with people telling us that illegal drugs shouldn&#039;t be taken when you have existing mental health problems. Since I&#039;ve been sober I have noticed that I&#039;m a lot better at coping with myself when I get into my low points and I am nowhere near as bad at dealing with said low points than before I started taking anything at all. Am I just an anomaly or are there other people out there with similar experiences? I&#039;m not saying that all my problems have completely disappeared since drugs but the way I deal with them has vastly improved and the swings in my moods aren&#039;t as self destructive as they used to be. I know this is probably going to be ignored by people because who likes reading a large block of text? But if you have the time please let me know your experiences with this kind of thing!

				Drugs are a double edged sword, they will help you and hinder you. The trick is to recognize when they are helping and when they are not.

				the above two posts are right. I have IBS, and without weed I&#039;m unable to function. Smoking soothes my stomach cramps and helps stop the diarrhea I get every day. But, if I smoke too much weed I&#039;d just become a useless burnout, so I need to find a happy medium.&nbsp; Sadly, when it comes to chems and hard drugs, I have no willpower. I&#039;m not one of those guys that can keep a tackle box of of their favorite chemicals to break out on Arbor Day or whatever the fuck they&#039;d celebrate. I always re-dose, compulsively, until I either run out, black out, or completely freak out

				Cheers guys. I&#039;ve been smoking weed since I was about 14 but only every couple of weeks or so then when i turned 16 I was smoking pretty much every single day (apart from the weekends when I would get speed or other stimulants) This carried on right up until the other month when my mum got tired of it and sent me to live with my dad at the opposite end of the country and I&#039;ve already been put back on anti-depressants because it&#039;s been getting too hard to handle again. That&#039;s why I joined this site. I lack the people skills to actually go out and find a source around here which is ridiculous because it&#039;s half an hour away from London so i should have no problem finding someone. I just need payday to finally arrive then I will be sorted I guess.
