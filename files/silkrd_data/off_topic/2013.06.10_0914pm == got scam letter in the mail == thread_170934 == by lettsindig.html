				Hi, <br /><br />just wanted to let you know of some kinda scam letter i seem to have gotten after the business with some unknown vendor here..&nbsp; my addressee just told me it arrived today and sent me a photo of it. Cant tell which vendor as ive ordered from many different to that address, but if others have got the same maybe we could narrow it down to find out.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure its some kinda fraud and came as a result of some order here, as thats pretty much the only mail ever received to that address/name.<br /><br /><br />its basically a 1-page letter from a supposed law firm in Spain saying that some business magnate who lived there had died in the earthquake in China some years ago on his holiday there, and they used my country&#039;s records to find me with the similar last name and that i may be eligible for the cash&nbsp; &nbsp;blabla..<br /><br />the (last-)name of the deceased, my name and country and all is correct, and it seems well written with a signature and stamp in the end (iv only seen a photo of the letter yet), so they prolly put a minute or two into each letter unless theyve got some way to automate it, prolly..<br /><br />in the end it says to call or fax this lawyer, or send him an email on 2 email addresses, one gmail address and another email with the domain &quot;jfrebullabogados.es&quot;, i googled this and found no info on either emails so guess not many got this (yet?).&nbsp; <br />The domain jfrebullabogados.es&nbsp; was registered on 25th of may 2013&nbsp; but is not available for browsing atleast.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just thought id put it out there, maybe someone else get similar and find this, or that this becomes googlable then for others searching it.
