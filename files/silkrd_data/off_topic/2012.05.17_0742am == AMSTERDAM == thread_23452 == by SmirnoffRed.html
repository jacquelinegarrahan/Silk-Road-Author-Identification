				Hey guys so in 2 weeks I&#039;ll be going to Amsterdam and around Europe for a few months<br />and I just wanted to ask for your advice on getting hooked up there? I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s pretty easy in the red light district but I&#039;ve also heard a lot of the people there sell fake shit so I don&#039;t really wanna trust that / take the chance. I&#039;m going to a few festivals there that are coming up Sensation White and Electronic Family so some molly or speed would be almost a must for me!<br />But anyways any help or advice would be very much appreciated cheers guys =)

				The red light district in A is the worst place to score, you&#039;ll be ripped off endlessly. Try the Trance Buddha Club or other clubs. Maybe the festivals would be good occasions too.

				Send yourself LOTS of postcards, letters, small packages.<br />&quot;Get to know&quot; LOTS of &quot;friends&quot; who will do the same for years to come. Get some &quot;pen pals&quot; all over the EU while you&#039;re there.<br />Make a big deal about going, how do I forward my mail, how are we going to handle this, all of my mail.....<br /><br />Adopt a deslote family and have them send you lots of stuff.....whatever it takes to establish a well documented &quot;legitamate&quot; stream of mail from that area and beyond.<br />Become a world traveler and pen pal to the world! While you can do it publicly and all.

				First off, i got ripped off so bad when trying to buy LSD in the RL-District. I just got paper instead. Dont do that mistake. <br /><br />The headshops almost always have some generic legal versions of Extacy. And the truffles are powerful as well. <br /><br />If your in Europe the 30 june - 4 july you absolutely MUST try the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. I have been on a lot of festivals and Roskilde tops it. Its one of the biggest festivals in all of Europe and it is non-profit wich means that they spend all their money to make the festival better year for year. I dont come there for the music (wich is pretty good). I come there for the vibe. Punk and pop people live side by side. Its very peacefull and energetic. People spend the whole year preparing for this festival to make their camp the best party place. You basically just walk around in an oasis of small and big parties. And ohh yes - there will be drugs :) <br />PM me if you are going, and I will show you a good time ! If your paranoid, dont PM me, but go anyways. You wont regret it!

				if you don&#039;t get ripped off/served fske shit in the red light you got a solid chance of getting busted... lots of undercovers stinging tourists<br /><br />when i was there tons of guys would walk behind and follow for like 10 paces asking if we wanted like every drug... you want coke, ecstasy, acid, etc. def dont trust those pushers <br /><br />i would order off here and smuggle in your personal doses in your toiletries kit or cop at the festival. good luck

				Order here and bring it with you.&nbsp; You would be amazed at what you can get on a plane by simply putting it in gel capsules and keeping them in an unmarked pill container. (One of the generic plastic ones that come in a strip with a compartment marked for each day.)&nbsp; As long as the rest of your bag is clear, (no liquids, weapons, etc.) they won&#039;t bat an eye.&nbsp; Brought a decent bit of blasting powder with me last time I flew across the country&nbsp; ???&nbsp; TSA lady had that in one hand and my bic in the other and only commented on the awesome design on the lighter.&nbsp; They did take my toothpaste though.&nbsp; &nbsp;::)

				NEVER buy stuff off the shifty guys lurking in alleys who say things like &#039;what you need? and &#039;what you need man&#039; and &#039;good coke, good E&#039;. <br /><br />I am in the Dam a lot and sure,some of the clubs you can get some E - many are so high they want others to get as high and the Dutch get cheap top quality MDMA crystal or pills plus you can test them. There are usually friendly folk at festivals who will sell good MDMA but ask around - look for the happiest ravers and check what they are on!<br /><br />Better still bring your own MDMA and speed (if you can actually find speed here on SR!) Its rare for anyone to be searched fully going to the Dam but you will get the odd check and sniffer dogs might pop up anywhere these days. So seal that MDMA! Or whatever! A good treble vacuum and careful handling will ensure NO smell. Of course it would be nice to send it via SR to an address in the Dam.<br /><br />Buying bud and hash can be a risk - but read up and choose the good well known shops that Dutch people actually use a lot. If you see a gang of Dutch regulars then its likely worth sticking around.<br /><br />Be wary of random guys in the street offering whatever. I only know of one person who actually ever bought a decent coke in the red light area. She was lucky she was with a boyfriend who threatened the dealer that if it was shit he would punch him.<br /><br />Some shops have a microscope - ask them for use of these amazing machines That way you can check too see if the bud is mature or if its been hacked at 8 weeks instead of 10! You can check hash as many Dutch shops have average hash. Even that is way better than UK hash and Americans and others outside the EU often do not see hash.<br /><br />Hash cakes are usually weak tourist rip offs. Best buy a gram of good hash and eat it.<br /><br />Good luck and enjoy.<br /><br />Am off myself for business and pleasure soon!<br /><br />

				Thanks for all the replies! =)<br />My main concern with bringing my own is I&#039;m from Australia so everything here costs 2x if not 3x more then it does over there in Europe..<br />But I suppose better to be safe then sorry right? I still have 4 hits of acid left and I was thinking of bringing them over but I was&nbsp; a bit sketched out about bringing shit over in my luggage.. I&#039;m guessing acid wouldn&#039;t be too hard to take with me would it? <br />

				keep like 2 hits of acid in your pocket if you get caught just eat them. It will look like pocket lint in any scanner and its not like a dog could smell it.
