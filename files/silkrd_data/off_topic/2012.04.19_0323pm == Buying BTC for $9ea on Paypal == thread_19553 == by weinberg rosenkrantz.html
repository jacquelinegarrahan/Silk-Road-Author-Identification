				Yes yes.. Paypal.. Yes yes.. Low post count. What can I say? There&#039;s no reason for you to believe me or trust me really. <br /><br />Basically I&#039;m willing to buy BTC for $9ea using Paypal. Why? Because its the 4/20 sale and it&#039;s the only possible way I&#039;ll get any bitcoins in time. <br /><br />I figure, if anyone wants to do this, we&#039;ll just do a small transaction, say 5-10btc. I&#039;ll send you the money in paypal first and then when you&#039;ve got the money, you can withdraw to your bank and send me the BTC.<br /><br />Sure, there is still the danger of chargebacks. But that&#039;s why I recommend doing small amounts. There are people out there who are sad enough to scam for such small amounts.. but I genuinely just want some fucking btc for this 4/20 sale.<br /><br />If we&#039;re doing small amounts it also means that you can set up another email address and use that one to receive the money, and then send it on to your main account without me finding out your name (I think paypal still lets you send small amounts of money without having to add a card/bank account). <br /><br />You will have my name and bank details so if I scam (and I wont) feel free to post them all over here. My genuine concern is making these sales. Any takers?

				Just use get-bitcoin.com - do a cash deposit to Bank Of America -email a scan of the deposit receipt - you&#039;ll have your BTC today for much less than the $9/BTC you&#039;re willing to pay.

				mate? $9 each? This is too good to be true. That is almost double the BTC/US$ rate. Including SR fees &amp; shit you are paying a fortune for drugs on SR. They could not possibly be that expensive in the UK. You are most likely a scammer or LE.<br /><br />Even if you are genuine, this is a very irresponsible post. The many ways you can purchase bitcoins safely. There is no need to endanger yourself or others in this community like this. Especially since another prominent drug market recently get busted. You getting caught means LE can use your account/evidence and bust others. SR noobs coming to the forums for the first time and seeing a post like this may think it&#039;s normal and safe to deal with paypal here. <br /><br />I think it&#039;s best you close this thread.

				You start wrong, you end wrong.<br /><br />Your title started wrong, because you are starting off with a digital paper trail, but there may be hope.<br /><br />If you are in the U.S. and you can make a cash deposit into an exchanger, it WILL show up in time for the fireworks this weekend.<br /><br />There are plenty of sources in this very forum.
