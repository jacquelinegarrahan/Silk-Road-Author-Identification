				BTH can have better high because it contains diacetylmorphine&nbsp; which brand name WAS &quot;heroin&quot; about 100 years ago, it also contains 3-monoacetylmorphine and 6-monoacetylmorphine&nbsp; so the high indeed might be much better. &quot;white heroin&quot; doesn&#039;t say anything at all but considering it&#039;s&nbsp; diamorphine (diacetylmorphine-diamorphine-heroin) hydrochloride ( hydrochloride- no 4) it should have differen&#039;t high more &quot;cleaner&quot; or &quot;less bodyhigh&quot; maybe. Noww headaches happens to everyone and it&#039;s pretty annoying because they ruin the high. I never find out exactly why they happen but there are theories that &quot;you did too much&quot; , &quot;raspiratory depression - you don&#039;t get enough air into the brain&quot;, &quot;side effect of opiates like Narcotic Analgesic Rebound Headache&quot;, &quot;awful cuts like paracetamol pills or something like that&quot; .. Could be anything.. But my guess it&#039;s side effect i used to have&nbsp; headache sometimes when i started my weekly session then they would go away. usually would be with the first dose ( and still not more than 30%).

				Good old west coast desert black has always been my preferred, and it certainly does have a totally different high from any powdered heroin. The rush is much stronger, the high is more euphoric. <br /><br />I never get a headache from powder heroin, but I do get one from methadone and hydrocodone. There is NOTHING worse than an opiate headache, absolute misery so you can&#039;t even enjoy the high.

				grdr - you beat me to it. :)<br /><br />I would add that I also prefer the #3 high to the #4 high, for similar reasons. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just psychological (what&#039;s the real difference between #3 and #4? Caffeine?), but I find that #3 also has a warmer, less pharmaceutical, less clinical high than #4. As a UK H addict who has been using #3 for most of my time, I was really looking forward to getting my hands on some top-drawer Canadian #4. When the time came I found that although it had some real strength, the #4 just didn&#039;t have the same personality. I&#039;d bang some up and it would creep up on me... then WHAM, I&#039;m KOed for the next few hours. Where as good #3 would go BANG straight away, a warmth spreading throughout my body, followed by hours of nodding in and out (therefore experiencing more of the &#039;buzz&#039; consciously). 8)<br /><br />It my just be some sort of psychosomatic, placebo effect that&#039;s all in my head. And, at the end of the day they&#039;re all good anyway. ;D 8)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Noriega had some good #3 and #4 from Holand, but went wrong in the end. Hope that helps, you know I must promote c63 so much on here I should be getting some kick backs&nbsp; ;D. But as I&#039;ve said before, as soon as his gear is crap I&#039;m off, same as any other vendor. Which would be a shame because you could find a more professional vendor.
