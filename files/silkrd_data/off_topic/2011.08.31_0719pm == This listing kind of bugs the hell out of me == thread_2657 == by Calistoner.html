				Not sure why, but pedo&#039;s seem to think it is ok to fwap to CP if it is in anime form. maybe because it is in the grey area of legality? i dont really know, im not sure of the legal status, and to be honest I don&#039;t really care. It is disgusting all around because you KNOW the people who have that kind of porn on their comps also have real CP, and i bet you anything this is where it starts. Soon there will be like special custom listings for pedo&#039;s to buy, where they get download links to CP, if that hasnt already happened&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br /><br />here&#039;s the listing <br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/7241<br /><br />wiki link for more info<br /><br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lolicon<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I understand this is a free market but shouldn&#039;t we draw the line somewhere?<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know much about lolicon, but it seems that no actual children are being harmed. There may be a high degree of overlap between people who watch that and watch CP, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re the same thing. If SR is about not selling things that cause harm, then I see the line being drawn at real CP, which to my knowledge has never been allowed.

				Pedo&#039;s are people 2. Sexuality is an strange thing, but everyone has his own problems. I dont agree with CP, but I dont agree either with morals and judging people. If someone has an unstoppable urge to see CP, and deny that, it fucks his mind. It is not his fault, he has to accept that, just like homosexuality.<br /><br />Peace and love

CP is sick and anyone who watches it is sick.. whatever the form.. the only reason they&#039;re doing anime is because they know they&#039;ll get f*cked for watching real stuff (or they can&#039;t find it).. sick sick sick motherf*ckers.. kids should be kids not some tool for some sexual deviant pscyho.. <br /><br />Just my opinion.. if I had one around me I&#039;d f*ck &#039;em up.. everyday...<br />

				I would much rather pedophiles be sitting in their basement jerking off to Lolicon than hiding behind the playground waiting for the recess bell. Also, Silkroad sells guns. Guns bought for the purpose of extinguishing a life. Get your priorities straight man, there&#039;s worse on here than the hentai equivalent of midget porn.

				just the other day i went shooting with my buddies, had all sorts of fun guns, i even got to shoot an m16 and a 7mm sniper rifle, and a big variety of shotguns and pistols. <br /><br />guns are not solely bought for murder. that is just plain ignorance. anyone who believes that needs to rethink some things.<br /><br />guns are not solely bought for protection, although it is a big reason people buy them. <br /><br /><br />i was raised in a gun toting family, with most of the males being ex military, guns were just part of life.<br /><br /><br />people like to shoot guns.

				@Californeeya - It seems like the gun prices on SR are really expensive. I imagine California has very strict gun laws (assuming your state from your name), but aren&#039;t you right next to Oregon, where you can just go to a gun show and get it just as anonymously, but cheaper and without having to worry about illegal packages? The debate about whether weapons should be on here aside, they seem so expensive that even if I needed a gun, I would just find the state nearest me with the fewest restrictions and go buy anonymous through some loophole. I only reference the US because every time I&#039;ve looked, all the gun sellers have been US based and mostly shipped exclusively to the US (with a few vending to Canada too).

After all, you knew ahead of time that those blue caps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you&#039;d be cracking the skull of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur---what if it had been driven off or its tires spiked? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin&#039;s thirst; the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn&#039;t love freedom enough. And even more. We had no awareness of the real situation. We spent ourselves in one unrestrained outburst in 1917, and then we hurried to submit. We submitted with pleasure! .We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward ...&quot;<br /><br />personally, I think, instead of the people fearing them, our employees [the government] needs to start fearing the people again, never knowing where we will strike if they decide to go to far. Not knowing who is armed and who isnt armed, not knowing which door they kick in might retaliate with a hail of gunfire coming through the door.<br /><br />I can not speak for anyone but myself, but I certainly would give great pause if ordered to perform questionable acts against my fellow citizens while under their employment ... and most of all I might start questioning the orders themselves becasue of it.<br /><br />thats your ultimate check and balance system.<br /><br />

I thought you had said you bought a pistol off SR, not &quot;if I bought&quot;. My mistake. <br /><br />Most of your response I agree with completely, however I can see people buying guns anonymously just for the hell of it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t have any interest in owning guns, but I was also raised in a gun toting family and am very comfortable around them. None of my family members are murderers, but they all buy their guns unregistered and without background checks through person to person trading or gun shows. If I&#039;m not mistaken, there are quite a few states where you can get guns without background checks. I&#039;ve only been to Cali when I was much younger and I&#039;ve never been to Oregon, but the info was interesting... always nice to learn more about the laws of the land. :)<br /><br />But back to my point: Why do they, law abiding citizens (as opposed to my criminal self ;)), do their best to keep their guns off the grid? Politics, man... for some people, its just the principle and paranoia. So I can totally see why someone might not want their gun registered or information jotted down, without any nefarious motive either. But the person who goes to SR to buy a gun still confuses me because I feel like you can accomplish the anonymous gun purchase in most of America very easily and somewhat legally (interstate transport would obviously be illegal).<br /><br />Ahh, that was a rambling post, but yea... you probably know what I&#039;m getting at.
