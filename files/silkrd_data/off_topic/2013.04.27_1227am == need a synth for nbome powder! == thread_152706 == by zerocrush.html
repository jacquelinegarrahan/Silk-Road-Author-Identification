				You can order LSD type blotted paper many places online and I have seen a few people listing blotter paper here and there.. But it is just number 14 water color paper as a whole.. IF you are going to do your own art / prints you do need to ensure that the ink you use is safe.. Not all inks are safe for human consumption

You want to ensure that your paper is chlorine free as well.. I know lithograph stays well.. not sure if speedball would .. it might bleed but you can check into setting the inks.. there are more then a few ways.. You can also Buy per-printed blotters with art on line btw just search blotter art and you should have more then a few sites come up.
