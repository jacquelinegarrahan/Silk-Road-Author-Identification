				Okay, many of you benzo natives out there have probably dealt with poundsign on SR before and if you have, you know he runs his game like a real professional.&nbsp; He takes care of his customers like no other vendor I have dealt with on SR.&nbsp; So, after a huge mad dash to order up all his xanax bars last week, he is out of supply and had to delist.&nbsp; Out of the compassion he has for people who suffer through benzo withdrawal, he graciously set aside 50 xanax bars for his customers going thru benzo withdrawal until he can resupply.&nbsp; On Thursday, some asshole stole $1500 and his remaining 50 bars he set aside for his customers that need them.&nbsp; I say we help him out anyway we can.&nbsp; If you have dealt with poundsign before, then you know how amazing he/she is and how gracious he/she is.&nbsp; The faster we help him, the quicker we can get him back and running thus helping him out.&nbsp; Any thoughts on how we could do this?&nbsp; JUST SO YOU KNOW, POUNDSIGN HAS NO CLUE I AM POSTING THIS AND HAS NOT ASKED ME TO ASK FOR HELP OR ANYTHING BUT WHEN A HERO OF SR GETS FUCKED, I FEEL WE SHOULD DO WHATEVER IS POSSIBLE TO HELP OUT A PERSON WHO RISK SO MUCH FOR US! let me know if you have any suggestions.
