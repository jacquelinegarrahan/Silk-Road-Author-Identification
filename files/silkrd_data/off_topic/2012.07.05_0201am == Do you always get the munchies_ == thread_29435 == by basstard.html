				Curious. I know I don&#039;t always eat after getting blazed. I only noticed this recently while smoking with a buddy. They were stuffing their face with cheetos and ice cream. And they turned to me while I was intently playing video games. Perhaps I get too focused.

				Random question: Where you hungry before you had smoked? I&#039;ve noticed that when I am starving and I take a few rips my hunger seems to suppress before coming back even strong a bit later. ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;Also there is some strain differences as well, I&#039;ve noticed certain weed giving my the hungry feeling more so than other types. <br />Who knows? Guess a bunch of stoners will have to speculate until labs can start doing more intensive testing.<br /><br />-Cheers

				I feel like I almost &quot;outgrew&quot; that phase many years ago when I first started smoking. This is not to say that I still don&#039;t occasionally get the munchies, but the days of getting high and destroying all the food in my pantry are long gone. It&#039;s more along the lines of &quot;I&#039;m stoned and I have a craving for... [Insert some unhealthy food],&quot; not &quot;I&#039;m stoned, let&#039;s fucking eat everything!&quot;<br /><br />I noticed this when I was hanging out with a friend whose little brother also smoked (by little, I mean he was 18). We hooked them up with a bag like nice, irresponsible older people and then watched them proceed to eat everything in the house while my friend and I sat there and played video games. To each&#039;s own I guess...

				While it may be true that different strains cause different levels of &quot;munchies&quot; I personally think that after you tip over 2-3 blunts/joints a day, you can pretty much ignore the munchies and it&#039;s not a big a bother lol

				I used to get the munchies something awful. Made myself puke on chinese food two separate occasions. Since then I&#039;ve trained myself to (mostly) not get the munchies.<br /><br />Some strains, though, are especially stimulating to appetite and still get me munching a little more than when I&#039;m sober, but not nearly enough to make me sick.

				I don&#039;t usually get the munchies, but I do usually eat after smoking just in case I do get hungry later on. I usually just eat yogurt or some fruit, I don&#039;t understand how some people can shovel food into their mouths, 90% of the time being junk.<br /><br />sdesu

				I&#039;ve found that if I wake n bake while starving, it suppresses that feeling and I don&#039;t have to eat for a while. I used to get the munchies until I decided to become more involved in the sport I play. I&#039;ve convinced myself that the munchies are a conditioned behavior that I can break if I just stop giving in to it. Plus, it can get expensive.

				I actually quit smoking weed because it made me way to hungry.&nbsp; I could eat a nice dinner... 2 hours later smoke a blunt and I could destroy anything in front of me.&nbsp; I ended up going from 175 pounds with a 6 pack to 225 pounds with a keg.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t touched weed in 6 months and I am back down to my old self 175 in shape and I can control my eating.&nbsp; Weed only made me 2 things... hungry and really stupid, I would zone out and not listen to my friends I would be in my own little world thinking in my head about dumb shit.&nbsp; Done with weed for good.&nbsp; MDMA + cocaine = no hunger and I can talk my ass off.&nbsp;

				In my experience unless I&#039;m really full or really hungry (for some odd reason) before smoking indicas (high CBD to THC ratio) I&#039;ll get the super-munchies, I can inhale 5000 kCal worth of food in a day and then just veg out.<br /><br />Sativas OTOH almost never give me the munchies.

				I usually do, I can&#039;t help but binge eat when I smoke. I just got done eating two Hawaiian rolls filled with honey, a bowl of Honeycombs, a slice of chocolate cake, a turkey sandwich, a peanut butter &amp; honey sandwich, a bagel with cream cheese and jelly, 3 eggos, and chugged about 2 liters of an Arnold Palmer. It&#039;s so nice having an over-active metabolism, I&#039;ll probably lose more weight from chewing it all than weight gained. ;D

				In the first few hours after I smoke weed my appetite is suppressed and eating is the last thing that I want to do. But once I start coming down I am like a grizzly bear coming out of hibernation and I will eat anything I can get my hands on.
