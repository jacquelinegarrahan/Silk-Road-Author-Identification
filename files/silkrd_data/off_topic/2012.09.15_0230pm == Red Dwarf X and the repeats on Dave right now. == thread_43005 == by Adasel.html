				IS it me or is the lag on dave a massive fuck up when you watch the red dwarf repeats??<br />Also, anyone going to watch, or looking forward to the new series?<br />Personally they should have ended it before Christine fucking Kochanski got involved.

				US, so no idea about Dave lag, but agree that they should have stopped once Rimmer left/not tried to resurrect the show after the hiatus. The last two seasons/back to earth were just sad. Like watching a stupid kid playing with a dead puppy and wondering why it won&#039;t fetch.&nbsp; =\<br />Still going to watch, just in case. A guy can hope...

				Yeah, the earlier series were the best. Series 3 / 4 especially. Didn&#039;t one of the writers leave&gt; Can&#039;t remember whether is was Grant or Naylor?

				Back to Earth WAS pretty shit i must admit.&nbsp; It&#039;s only because Craig Charles was working on Coronation Street at the time, that the writers came up with the idea.<br />Apparently Charles had to be put back in line after his first few eps in Corrie, turning up drunk etc on set.&nbsp; Thats probably why his acting is a bit &quot;shoddy&quot; in the Back to Earth plot.
