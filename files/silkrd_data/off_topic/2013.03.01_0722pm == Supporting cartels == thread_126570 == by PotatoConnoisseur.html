				I just read a couple articles about cartel violence in Mexico and it really got me thinking about how my drug use is financing them. I like to occasionally do cocaine, I&#039;m not a huge user by any means but I do enjoy it, and as far as I know almost all cocaine available goes through drug cartels. Contributing even in a very small way to such violence just seems fucked up to me, I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m never going to do cocaine again but I&#039;m definitely going to have to think hard about whether it&#039;s worth it before buying any more. Anybody else ever have similar thoughts? Or am I completely off base and not all cocaine is run through cartels and I&#039;ve just seen Blow too many times or something? <br /><br />

				How can you take upon yourself responsibility for things you are not involved with personally?<br /><br />Why not ditch your cellphone (and other electronic gadgets) because it has coltan and that&#039;s the cause of untold misery for people in the DRC? If you don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about, do a search for &quot;coltan cellphones DRC&quot; on the web.

				Yeah that&#039;s true, I actually don&#039;t drive very often but that&#039;s more because it isn&#039;t necessary where I live and I&#039;m a fan of exercise. Also I&#039;m an American so even paying taxes is funding all sorts of bullshit conflicts. Not to mention all the bullshit that goes into the products we buy, electronics and all sorts of shit made in shitty conditions and sweat shops. Shit is just fucked up, I have a lot of respect for people who drop off the grid and live sustainably off the land. Don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever do it myself but still, it&#039;s pretty damn cool.

				Think of it this way. Aspirin is a drug, but it doesn&#039;t empower any cartels. None of the over the counter drugs do, because they are legal and freely available.<br /><br />So drugs per se don&#039;t create organized crime, the drug laws do. Prohibitionists are to blame for organized crime and its associated violence.<br />

				I like to think that by ordering off of the SR, you are avoiding funding cartels. You&#039;re funding the vendor, his/her staff, and supplier(s). Many vendors ARE their suppliers.<br />Sure, they could lie, but when the price is dirt cheap and products are constantly changing... <br /><br />Think of a culinary student that knows how to make utterly delicious food. She&#039;ll cook (relatively) enormous amounts of food, and it only set her back a little more than buying it at a restaurant. She can only eat a plate or two. What is she going to do with all this food thats of <br />the same type?! And the next day she wants to cook something else that&#039;s just as delicious, but is simply different. Not like she can buy the ingredients in the exact proportions to the amount of cooked food she wants to eat.<br /><br /><br />But yeah, it gives me some mindfuck too. <br /><br />How do you know that local hoodie you buy the cheapest pot in town from a town over, isn&#039;t a cartel retailer? He deals from a house, but you&#039;ve never been inside. Maybe you thought, &quot;that&#039;s just silly&quot;, as you start bagging up your oz of stemmy bud for your buddies to buy. There are no cartel retailers around me! You think to yourself... And then you hand over the baggie and take the cash. Now you know for damn sure, mr hoodie isn&#039;t the cartel&#039;s retailer.<br /><br /><br />fuck local, buy from the road.

Perfect, unbiased, historical example. How much crime and violence is produced by alcohol trafficking today? Minimal I&#039;d assume--it&#039;s too easy to get over the counter.<br /><br />So don&#039;t feel as if you are funding cartels (which is already a stretch of guilt assumption). If you have to feel guilty for something, feel guilty that your money is funding a government-backed criminal organization (the government is much more closely tied to supporting the cartel than you are). Or cut out the middle-man and feel guilty that your taxes and such are funding a government that funds criminal organizations. <br /><br />Continue to abuse your drugs guilt-free, brother--boycotting is an ineffective form of protest in most any avenue and useless in this instance.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Thanks for the good responses. You&#039;re all right that boycotting wouldn&#039;t change anything, I just have an overactive conscience sometimes. Especially when it comes to drugs, if I ever get arrested I want to be able to look the judge or cop or whoever in the eye and tell them that I have a clean conscience. <br /><br />That being said, in the future I&#039;ll probably focus more on not getting arrested and less on speculating about pointless boycotts.&nbsp; :)
