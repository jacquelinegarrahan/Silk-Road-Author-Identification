				It&#039;s understandable man, we all got shit going on in our lives. Don&#039;t beat yourself up over it, everyone makes their own choices. Your friends drug problem seems like it stems from insecurities and self-esteem issues, but if he&#039;s truly your friend I think sacrificing a little of your time to help a guy out isn&#039;t out of the question either.

				Shit happens man. Don&#039;t blame yourself at all. It will only be a waste of time thinking about things. I mean blaming yourself won&#039;t bring him out of that coma. <br />When he comes out of the coma be there for him man.

				you can&#039;t change the past, so try not to dwell on it, as that will serve no purpose other than to cause you pain. all you can really do is be there for your friend from now on when he needs you.

				No. Absolutely not. You can’t take responsibility for anyone else’s life. They have to do that them self. I’m not a hash person but people need to love them self’s first before they love anybody else. Failure to do so will eventually harm your self-worth. It is like that situation in the airplane where parents need to take care of themself before there children because if the parents wont survive neither will the children. I feel sorry for your friend and for you. But if you have had the recourses to help him you would have. Simple as that.
