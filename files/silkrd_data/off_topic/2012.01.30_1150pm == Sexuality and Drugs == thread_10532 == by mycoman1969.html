				I thought that this might be a good topic to discuss.<br /><br />1. What drugs make people the most sexually charged? or turn you off of sex altogether?<br />2&nbsp; What drugs enhance the sexual experience most?<br />3. Do different drugs give you different fantasies?<br />4. Are there any drugs you have done that change you sexuality temporarily? Permanently?<br /><br />Coke used to make me exceptionally charged, but quite flacid. Couldn&#039;t stand it getting really horny and nothing could be done about it. I used to have intense fantasies watching lesbian porn. Couldn&#039;t stand seeing a penis on the screen. Or compilation cumshot videos at times too. It really depends.<br /><br />Extacy was great with my girlfriend. 8 hours and we wouldn&#039;t come up for air. The touchy feeling stuff really helped develop empathy for your partner and all you wanted to do was satisfy her.<br /><br />Tina charged me the most. Although it was quite difficult to get hard I could still do it. And I loved watching porn. All kinds. And it seemed like I got turned on by everything.&nbsp; Nothing seemed taboo. but only on ice.<br /><br />I also heard that with the right dose, GHB is supposed to be incredible.<br /><br />Mushrooms and acid was really difficult to get turned on, but if you did it was pure animalistic sex.<br /><br />And pot, I was was too paranoid. lol<br /><br />Anyone else?

				mdma is my first choice, it always gets me sexually charged and there&#039;s nothing better than 3 hour sex when you two are rolling. but it&#039;s not sex in the typical sense, it&#039;s almost tantric. slow and sensual. viagra helps.

				Depending on the strain, weed works pretty well. A nice strong sativa high and it feels amazing and gets me rather horny.<br /><br />LSD... I would love to try that! On a low dose, I have done it, very impressive. On a large dose (~350ug) I&#039;ve made out and it was absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, neither of us could concentrate long enough to go further since the whole world was going mental. If it were possible, it would be extremely intense.<br /><br />DMT feels really great, but really hard to finish.

				Yeah I am talking about only 20-30mg amounts, so not the full on space trips. :) <br /><br />And yeah I have found the best way is to get started, and while halfway through hit the DMT for the rest of it. You don&#039;t do much of the work after you hit the dmt. :P

				I personally like ~200ug LSD and a small amount of weed. <br /><br />The acid makes the mere thought of sex overwhelmingly interesting while the cannabis gets me hot enough to actually want to follow through.<br /><br />Percocet gets me way more horny, but hardness and endurance seem to be a big issue.

				To me, 2C-B is the ultimate substance for sex. It doesn&#039;t make horny, but it enhances and increases the natural erotic energy. I&#039;m not in esoteric at all, but I can&#039;t describe it better than &quot;boosting the sexual chakra&quot;.<br /><br />According to Shulgin, 4-MeO-MiPT is another aphrodisiac, but I&#039;ve never had the chance to try it.<br /><br />There&#039;s a substance called Bremelanotide or &quot;pt-141&quot; (a peptide) which directly addresses to the neural circuits of sexual desire. Sounds very interesting, but I don&#039;t know more about the effects, or if it can be compared to 2C-B.<br /><br />All in all I think that sex is more intimate if doing the same drugs together (depends on the drug, and the person). Being on the same stuff during sex is like if there is a mental/spiritual connection that is added to the physical and emotional one. But I don&#039;t want to say that sex can only get that intimate with drugs, it sure works without.<br />

				tried a lot of combos, but best sex experience on drugs up to now: two small bumps (10mg each, I can guess) of MDPV made the sex act lasting a lot and with satisfaction of both the partners. simple, fast and safe :) <br /><br />never been able to have sex on MDMA (which is my real thing, in fact) maybe cause on MD the entire universe becomes sexual?, nor on coke (which in meaningful doses is totally ugly, as everyone knows: the sexual excitement PLUS the physical impossibility to stay horny = the hell). <br /><br />pretty curious to try on 2C-family, even if all my trips with them (just 2c-e and 2c-i, not 2c-b) have always been a lot more spiritual than physical...<br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />I&#039;d be interested in hearing your description if you feel like posting it. People probably shouldn&#039;t click on a thread explicitly combining the taboo topics of sex n drugs if they can&#039;t handle hearing anything beyond married missionary in the dark. No offense to those who like it purely vanilla, of course.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I do feel like posting it. I love sharing. I feel like the more we hide in the closet with our stories, the more we allow people who don&#039;t have our interests in mind to speak for us and &#039;re-present&#039; us (I think I can present myself pretty well, thanks).. So here goes.<br /><br />Context note: I was born a functional hermaphrodite in the early eighties, when it was still common practice to mutilate children who weren&#039;t born either fully male or fully female. Since my penis was longer than a certain length, I was &#039;assigned&#039; male, and my vagina was sealed up and the records sealed. (Military procedure)... Of course, as is usually the case, It turns out I feel more like a woman than a man (Although honestly, I don&#039;t want to lose anything I currently am packing. I&#039;ve lost enough already). Ooops. Blame the secret treatie with &quot;Red Moon Over Water Rising&quot;.<br /><br />So the first time I freebased DMT seriously.. Well, I was a bit of a pussy at first, I didn&#039;t have a mg scale, so I was eyeballing it using a straw to collect the crystals and deposit them in the pipe. I typically have an insanely high tolerance to drugs (When I was a kid, I was prescribed methamphetamine throughout puberty. You figure out what that does) Though, that runs in the family. I remember my dad never saw anything on acid until he took like five hits of &#039;orange sunshine&#039;... This was back in the day before blotter had art on it, so I&#039;m not entirely sure why they called it that.. but I digress. After several low dose attempts each of which had made me feel rather excited, giddy, and yes.. horny) took a biiiig scoop of DMT and put it in the pipe boiled it, watched fascinated as the vapor spun around in the little globe, then inhaled.<br /><br />It smelled like bones. I dunno how else to describe it, and it tingled my tissues. I didn&#039;t want to exhale, but eventually I did, and I could see the smoke just animatedly coalescing as I blew it out my mouth. I found the experience extremely erotic (Mind you, I find smoking erotic). Then everything changed. fractal geometric patterns exploded in everything. I watched my computer try to tell me that it had exceeded the maximum insanity limit.. Then it said &#039;Oh holy fuck!&#039; I became aware of an interdimensional sentience contacting me. They wanted to study me, I wanted to study them.<br /><br />I looked at the pipe. It was glowing golden, I tilted it curiously, sniffing. It was cool now, but the DMT still seemed to pulse with an energy. I inhaled on it. math flew through my brain. Infinitely complex numbers made sense. I felt overwhelmed and present in the divine Feminine force called Shakti. <br /><br />I was potently aware of the desire of the force called Shiva for me. I put the pipe down, watched the liquid dmt ooze in the base of the pipe.. I had put a whole lot in there, and now it looked curiously golden. Well.. Like blackness at the bottom of a well, with gold vapors arising from it. I smoked some hashish, felt the warmth and protectiveness of the Mothering forces of the herb, I felt my insides twist. The scar where they hurt me, it pulsed, and it hurt, but it felt warm and good too. I found myself taking the warm freebase pipe and placing it at my root chakra, the place where there is still a line where my yomi should be<br /><br />I could hear song in my ears as this happened, and my toes curled. I shivered. Holding this close against the scar where my magnetic sex should be. I felt nurtured, assured. Peaceful. I could recall the moment at birth, when what was taken from me... I could know too, that I wouldn&#039;t have to wait too much longer, that with the force of Love.. being myself (It was always my dream, this is true, to embody the form of Love, as a means of transcendence. Unconditional, unashamed, deeply passionate love.) I could return to how I am supposed to be, to how I was born.<br /><br />I poured a little of the dark goo on my fingers, and I rubbed it in my sensitive areas, in the mucous membranes. I swear I could see the energy change colours as it absorbed into me. I shivered. Oh by all the names of all the many cosmic forces I had never felt so aroused in my life. I wanted to... Well.. I wanted virile electric masculine entities to take me and penetrate me with their lust, and for beautiful magnetic women to suckle at my bosom, to drink in the psychoactive milk.<br /><br />That half a gram of DMT changed my life. Very much for the better. Everything that I am was explored, validated, comprehended. Misunderstandings were easily obliterated, &#039;gotchas&#039; of physics became amusing rather than perplexing and difficult.<br /><br />I got that from Moon Unit, it was yellow.. I didn&#039;t notice a &#039;nasty&#039; flavor. I comprehend that yellow means its only been recrystalized once, and hasn&#039;t been further purified... And it did leave an interesting carbon deposit in the bottom of my freebase pipe that is.. seemingly unremovable. it literally seems to have melded into the glass (perhaps I, in my enthusiasm, heated the glass too far. I know glass will heat up that far, and I have done this before, only not with DMT. I&#039;ve also deliberately done it while trying to learn how to blow pipes (Don&#039;t ask me to blow pipes or bowls for you. I LOVE glass blowing... But unless you want to give me a studio, an assload of glass, and time to practice, I&#039;m going to be turning out uneven sloppy bowls.&nbsp; I do know my physics though<br /><br /><br />

				Alright, you guys haven&#039;t even lived until you&#039;ve had sex on acid, especially if the other is also tripping balls. Me and my girlfriend have the best sex of our lives while tripping, even better than when we&#039;re just baked. When we have sex, we both easily cum at the same time and we both agree that these are the most amazing orgasms of our entire lives. One time on&nbsp; my birthday, we were both tripping and she got up and said, &quot;I want you to have a really cool sexual trip.&quot; She then proceeded to give me hands down the single greatest blowjob of my entire life, and frankly the best sexual experience I have ever had. It lasted forever and it felt fucking fantastic, and I was almost lost in the pleasure of it. And when I finally came, it honestly felt like every bad part of me just escaped through my dick, and I literally shook with ecstasy. <br /><br />I love my girlfriend&nbsp; ;D

				Sex is much better, with no drugs, if you need drugs you are doing it wrong.&nbsp; Just about all drugs affect your judjement in some way and in good sex you need full control of your senses.&nbsp; Dont get me wrong sex on drugs is good, but once you know someone, sex is best enjoyed straight.&nbsp; So for a first time it might soothe the nerves but besides that not much helps.&nbsp; It can be a bit romantic sharing a pipe or something, lots of close contact, light hand touching, leaning in close.&nbsp; But the drug doesnt help

				Well everybody else was posting some fairly personal things, so I figured this is a great place for getting this out! I&#039;ve seen a couple posts on the interwebs where other people do this too, and I don&#039;t really have anybody to talk about it with. Is this common behavior for anyone else-the marathon masturbation sessions like for 12 hours or even more than 24? (I know its surely not normal lol) my favorite thing on meth. Actually ended up with some cheap adderall 30s tonight ($6 each[actually traded 4 perc 10s &amp; 1/2 tab 10 for 5 adderall IR 30s-yay!]), and while the rush and buzz arent quite as intense, I&#039;d say some fap&#039;n is coming up fairly soon. My wife already told me she don&#039;t want me to all night, and not right after we got high... 8-(&nbsp; So I&#039;m hangin out with my new friends on SR lol

				I think one of the most cynical, bitter, mean, cruel, inhumane practical jokes of mother nature is that MDMA gives you límp dick.<br /><br />Seriously, not a more sensual drug out there, yet it totally and utterly destroys any chance for a good erection. Viagra alleviates the problem only partially and not all that satisfying. Because a) the widening/relaxing of the blood vessels it causes seem to fuck with your roll, and you&#039;re still only on half-mast.<br /><br />Seriously, I HATE YOU NATURE....

				But it may turn you into a demon...<br /><br />I tried Yohimbe once years ago. I made a tea from maybe 1 or 2 teaspoons. Yes, I got good wood, but the stomach cramps and nausea didn&#039;t get me feeling too sexy...<br /><br />I was on my own, a dry-run so to speak, which was just as well, because when I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face I saw the devil in the mirror: my eyes were like two big frickin rubies, completely shot with blood, not a trace of white left. I certainly wouldn&#039;t have fucked me looking like that. After a restless night, jerking, dry heaving, jerking, I finally got some sleep and eventually woke up normal again, but fairly shaken up. Never again, for me.

				Kudos to the OP, a great subject, maybe even worthy of it&#039;s own sub-forum?! Or research project, fuck knows it might even put some positive spin on stuff in the media!<br /><br />As I see it, people take drugs to experience new things, so if you choose to limit yourself sexually (on or off drugs) then there could be a bit of a contradiction there. I&#039;ve tried most things, and it&#039;s generally been all good.<br /><br />As a smoker and drinker, I&#039;ve only avoided the more addictive things: crystal, crack, H. They&#039;re about my only limits.<br /><br />Psychedelics and dissociatives are my preferred avocation. Have had great sex on 2CB &amp; acid (not simultaneously...) can be very emotional, but can also look a bit too weird if you get fixated on the wrong body part... K makes me very horny, and gets me thinking about all sorts of dirty weirdness, but functionally nearly useless.<br /><br />Probably the most &quot;efficient&quot; drug I&#039;ve found for sex is mephedrone, of all things. I know as well as anybody it&#039;s many drawbacks (the worst comedown I&#039;ve ever had once, and I hardly ever need to use that term). But as &quot;cheap dirty coke&quot; it made for great filthy sex, with no awkward side effects.<br /><br />Nobody&#039;s mentioned poppers (amyl) yet, but assuming you can get a quick blast at exactly the right moment, (without spilling it into your partner&#039;s face) nothing comes close, and it potentiates virtually everything beautifully. I think it&#039;s really odd that it&#039;s generally assumed to be &quot;just for the guys&quot;. Most women I&#039;ve tried it with have loved it too. Just keep it on standby in the fridge, livens up things any old time.<br /><br />Weed is nice for sexy baths; showers, not so much...<br /><br />One small line of coke is great, but whoever had just one small line?!<br /><br />Molly, I&#039;m with the person who said they love the whole world, and can&#039;t easily narrow their focus down to a single person. Biomechanically I&#039;m not great either, which is a shame, as I kinda envy those who can use it like that.

				This may just be me but, I find i&#039;m more horny when I use weed, I think a lot of people get this it don&#039;t make you want sex more I don&#039;t think, but it makes you enjoy it more.<br /><br />Just my personal opinion it&#039;s probably one of the healthiest drugs too.

				I really like Methylone. It turns me into a sexual beast. 15-18 hour masturbating sessions is not only common but expected, which can be considered good or bad. Oftentimes both. I&#039;ve had orgasms, from the moment I start to cum until I&#039;m done, last for over a minute. It&#039;s crazy.<br /><br />But my favorite orgasms are from marijuana. To me, they&#039;re the most pleasurable. In fact, it&#039;s the reason I became hooked on pot. That and it&#039;s the best sleep aid available.

				Only thing I know is weed is great for sex it feels a lot more intense in my opinion, I always wanted to fuck on ecstasy but am too scared for it never feeling the same normal again. Such a release of chemicals in your brain can&#039;t be good.

Is it possible at all to have sex on dissociatives?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey Moksha, thanks for your comments. I just tried MXE for the first time, and posted a rough and ready report in the &quot;Reich Review&quot; thread in the Rumor Mill.<br /><br />The only dissociative I&#039;ve tried regularly is K, and I think the key word is &quot;dissociative&quot; i.e. your mind and body temporarily part company to some degree or another. As sex depends on your body co-operating with your mind, and at least one other body, well, at best you&#039;re looking at a seriously uphill struggle&nbsp; ???<br /><br />For me, a good K-hole is a completely internalized journey of the mind, completely set free from the body in which it&#039;s usually contained. Psychedelics (at normal doses) usually don&#039;t give rise to that sensation, although things like &quot;DMT Hyperspace&quot; and other realms come pretty close, but in a different way.<br /><br />Having said that, MXE could be promising. It lasts a long time (4-6 hours, compared to say 1 hour with even a strong dose of K) but is far less incapacitating. For a male at least, I can confirm that normal sexual function is achievable, if not completely spontaneous. Need to do more experiments...! Perversely, my thoughts whilst tripping were a lot less sexual than they often would be whilst on K.<br /><br />We need a broad-minded institution and some research grants!

I read somewhere that it can have a mild anaesthetic effect, in the sense that you don&#039;t notice you&#039;re sitting or moving uncomfortably whilst high, but feel an ache once it wears off. We got it really bad when we first tried it, with 80mg each. Since then tended to do about 40mg each and it&#039;s not too bad. It really gives you wings on the dancefloor, but the &quot;Cinderella&quot; effect kicks in about 5 am if you don&#039;t redose, and you feel like someone&#039;s whacked your knees with a baseball bat, reducing you to a useless pumpkin!<br /><br />Heard from a friend that MXE was in the English news today, govt talking about banning it already...<br /><br />As you&#039;re clearly used to lengthy psychedelic trips Moksha, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d be fine with MXE, but obviously you could also try a sub-optimal amount of K, for a shorter dip in the dissociative pool... I normally have to insufflate about 150-250 mg of K these days to get into a proper hole, and that&#039;s quite hard work to get in. The nice thing about MXE is how frickin potent it is. On a par with 2C-B by weight I&#039;d say.<br /><br />There&#039;s a useful page of info at, CLEARNET:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Methoxetamine

				While I love sex while sober/straight with my gf when we both get onto pretty much anything and stay at home (most of our drug use), it ends up being a 5 - 48 hour (depending on the binge and choice of poison) mix of music, cuddling, naked teasing, playing with each other every which way and of course sex marathon. A quick shower, and then restart at position 1.<br />We&#039;ve had sex on mdma, meth, mda and 2-cb. Hard to say which one was better to be honest, all were amazing!<br /><br />We&#039;ve tripped on acid twice but too much was going in our trip even though we were at home both times to get to sex lol... although the 1st acid trip about half way through while my gf was lying down on the floor with her eyes closed I put my fingers inside for literally 3 seconds only and she orgasmed so hard that she almost blacked out... needless to say I was amazed but forgot to try again in our second trip lol<br /><br />The main issue with sex on the above drugs (acid being the exception) is that my gf finds it nearly impossible to come... she gets to the point *JUST* before and stays there no matter how long I keep going.. If I have taken a reasonable dose of any of the above drugs (ie no more than 200mg mdma, or no more than 50mg meth smoked, etc) I have no problem getting hard and while it takes me a lot longer to get there, I always do... and no matter at what stage in the drug effect I am in (coming up, in the peak, or even several hours into the come down), when I do cum, I always get a rush from whatever drug I took last... as if there was some of it left in my brain waiting for this moment..<br /><br />For those times when we binge too much or mix too many drugs, I usually find half a Viagra does the trick! :D<br /><br />Also I find my gf&#039;s inhabitions (although she doesn&#039;t have many to speak of) virtually dissapear when on drugs.<br /><br />1 last thing - I strongly believe that the above drugs, especially mdma, don&#039;t just enhance the physical stuff; for us they really enhance the emotions and especially the passion we have for each other. I think this is the key effect for us...<br /><br />&lt;/yakkety-yak&gt;

				I can tell you what certainly does not fucking work: took a morphine sulfate pill, followed by few vodka drinks, followed by few hits of weed... pumped my lady for over an hour, was hard as stone but couldn&#039;t finish and after an hour she was asking me to stop. Lame!<br /><br />It was the vodka+morphine mix that killed it for me.<br /><br />Normally little bit of weed turns all the noise in my skull off and let&#039;s me concentrate all my attention on her. Just don&#039;t mix it with other shit! Opiates kill manhood!<br /><br />My favorite would be one or two whiskey on rocks or vodka+cranberry followed by weed... makes me horny as shit!

				A few lortab or percs, mixed with a couple beers makes me really horny - and that&#039;s when sex lasts for hours and is a lot rougher.<br /><br />As for sexuality, I&#039;m essentially a lesbian (I only have long term relationships with women), who has, on a few occasions, slept with guys while fucked up on opiates and had a really good time.

				2c-b is just soooo much better for sex than MDMA. It honestly isn&#039;t even a competition. 2c-b amplifies pleasure so much and it completely improves the performance of both partners. It also makes people &quot;look&quot; sexier than normal if that makes any sense. <br /><br />The tactile sensations of 2c-b are simply unrivaled. Only Foxy is in the same league as 2c-b.<br /><br />2c-b sex is so satisfying and you still feel amazing even after its done. After you have sex on MDMA you just feel so shitty and the comedown is so fucking rough.

				Just chiming in here to say that MDMA is awesome for sex. My girlfriend is bi, and we were at a party rolling with a few other people. Another girl that was there was also bi, so she and my girl started making out. They eventually ended up in the bedroom, where they invited me and the other girl&#039;s boyfriend. Let&#039;s just say an amazing time was had by all. So I&#039;m going to go ahead and call MDMA the best drug for orgies, because everyone is feeling the love.

				lol i will try to break this down in a simple way<br /><br />marijuana-tends to increase blood-flow and hence, a harder cock which definitely makes sex more enjoyable. it also makes it less serious which is a plus, its nice to just mess around a bit.<br /><br />4-fluoroamphetamine- i experienced a unity with my partner that was un-matched. i literally felt one with her and it was an amazing experience over-all, aside from the vasoconstriction that left me with a half chub.<br /><br />methamphetamine- sex lasted for FOREVER. wasnt the best sex id ever had and its frustrating to have to try to push a soft dick into a vagina... i didnt have much ambition to get the sex going either, and i definitely didnt feel like doing any foreplay or anything like that. it made me lazy and selfish now that i think about it hahaha. although outside of sex, i was very opened up emotionally. we talked for a long time about a lot of very deep subjects that are normally secluded from the conversation<br /><br />25i-nbome-now lately ive really been straying away from the nbomes because lately they&#039;ve just been freaking me out and they dont seem right. doesnt seem like a healthy experience for one to have.<br />but sex on 25i was fucking CRAZY. first off, i did all types of things that i wouldnt ever normally do. tried to fuck at all different angles and see what she liked the best.<br />i felt effects of vasoconstriction(my left hand went numb for about 2 weeks after this experience. and its still not fully recovered a month later) but i still had a rock-hard dick.... weird....<br /><br />miprocin or 4-ho-mipt-i experienced a sort of breakdown of the seperation of femininity and masculinity on this substance. all i was concerned with was compassion/connection and it didnt matter the form. sex was different, tried a few out of the ordinary things like on the nbome, (new sex positions, and i went down on her for way longer than usual)<br />but there was such a heightened sense of emotions during the experience. <br /><br /><br /><br />that was the difference between this and the nbome sexually, was that this had a soul-full connection.<br />&nbsp;the nbome was straight up intense, animalistic gorilla fucking. ;D<br /><br /><br />let me know if you like my little collection of experiences&nbsp; :P<br /><br />

				@mycoman1969: Thanks for resurrecting this awesome thread! It&#039;s a subject very dear to my heart :)<br /><br />And thanks to everyone for their excellent commentary on this subject...<br /><br />The relationship between drugs and sexuality is such a fundamental one. They are probably our two greatest sources of pleasure and so it is a natural human impulse to explore their synergy...<br /><br />For me there are many aspects to this conversation and many dimensions to what makes a drug a sexual enhancer and catalyst.<br /><br />Many drugs stimulate desire but impair function - most stimulants (cocaine, meth, speed) to one degree or another have this curse.<br /><br />Empathogens like MDMA, MDA, MBDB (delicious!) and MDE radically enhance intimacy (both emotional and sexual) but often lead away from direct sexual expression into a kind of loving communion that seems to go beyond sexuality. I&#039;ve had times when, in the rush of love-fullness, I&#039;ve simply forgotten to continue fucking the beautiful woman I&#039;m presently inside off!<br /><br />Depressants (in moderate doses) tend to enhance sexual function to varying degrees - opiates, alcohol, GHB and benzo&#039;s all relax the body and allow a certain disinhibition. Too much though and most become sexually useless. <br /><br />And of course Cannabis for all it&#039;s richness! (personally I like a Sativa dominant with a dash of Indica to balance). And LSD for how it opens and tunes all the centers. Taken in low doses underneath other drugs also allows their qualities to be accentuated.<br /><br />The entactogens are key sexual drugs - mainly 2C-B, 2C-C, AMT, AET, 5-MeO-DIPT and 5-MeO-MIPT - all of which increase tactile response and thus enhance frictional pleasure!<br /><br />Finally there are the sexual tonifying herbs such as Ashwaganda, Mucuna, Tribulus and Yohimbe (or Yohimbine HCL)<br /><br />My personal favorites for sex from all of these would be GHB, 2C-B, 5-MeO-MIPT and Cannabis. If I smoke Ganja then I like to experience it alone generally.<br /><br />GHB + 2C-B is excellent in the bedroom, and GHB + 5-MeO-MIPT is likewise excellent. To me GHB is the closest thing we have to an archetypal aphrodisiac. It causes strong sexual desire, enhances sexual function profoundly (helps men with premature ejaculation and women with difficulty attaining full orgasmic release), and is probably the best clean disinhibitor known. GHB moved through a group of people always get&#039;s very interesting ;)<br /><br />Yohimbe (as a tea) I also find very good as a tactile enhancer and also makes for a very strong erection and insane orgasms! <br /><br />All in all I find the best sex happens when there is deep relaxation and a profound emotional intimacy with my partner, and drugs the support that, I find work the best.<br /><br />BG<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Amps do it for me the most but I hate it. It&#039;s an obsession and it feels very dirty. Alcohol also tends to make me very horny and feels dirty at the end but not nearly as bad as amps. The other drugs I&#039;ve tried: weed, benzos and 2cb don&#039;t really do much or at least I don&#039;t notice any significant changes in my sex drive.

				The Grand Wizard may be biased, but I am a huge fan of sex on 2c-b.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here&#039;s a little secret for those guys who are a bit too quick out of the starting gate: a tiny dose of opiates works like a charm in slowing down premature ejaculation.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m talking 3-5mg of oxycodone if you&#039;re opiate-naive, not even enough to really get you feeling it.&nbsp; Do too much and you&#039;ll find yourself fucking for hours but unable to cum. A little bit, though, and you&#039;ll find that it both putteth on the desire and giveth great stamina to the performance. <br /><br />Stimulants only rarely make me horny: generally they put me in a productive mood, which is nice but means instead of concentrating on sex I&#039;m thinking about dusting the furniture. I know others react differently.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a lot of fun on sex with banana clonitrils, so I can definitely recommend clonazepam in small doses.<br /><br />And I&#039;d say sex on weed, but I rarely do anything when I&#039;m not on weed so that doesn&#039;t really count.

				The most incredible experience was having sex on LSD, then tripping out of my body...and when coming back in my body realizing that we were still activly making love... very intense and strange experience (animal reflexes and so on). My GF had just the same experience.<br /><br />Regarding cocaine: some is good for sex, others are not. You really have to look for the good fuck-coke. It&#039;s a bit rare, but it&#039;s still out there. <br /><br />On weed I was to tired and lazy. <br /><br />On mdma it&#039;s always nice, but never as intense as LSD.<br /><br />On mushrooms I didn&#039;t like to be touched - so that rules it out. <br /><br />On speed, you have a small dick but when you&#039;re able to get it hard it&#039;ll stand up for hours!<br /><br />Ketamine is not the right product for it (maybe in small doses). <br /><br />Mescaline: great in light dosage (very visual - but be shure you actually love the partner, otherwise it might turn out to be a monster during the trip - kinky if you like that kind of stuff... not my cup of tea). <br /><br />Tried some RC also, but don&#039;t remember the name of any of them. <br /><br />Some combinations are very good, <br />almost every stimulant will work fine with cannabis. <br /><br />Combinations with alcohol can be nice also, but are more difficult to find and to balance (personal factors).

My only concern is that coke after MDMA might increase MDMA neurotoxicity - just a sense, but would need to look into more...<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah if I have some coins lefts over from my next order I&#039;m going to be ordering some GHB or maybe even the Moxy caps from you as I&#039;ve not tried them yet and you make them both sound like amazing substances. Really want to try the GHB after some MDMA. Does it bring back the euphoria that MDMA gives after the peak plus a massive sexual drive?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />GHB does indeed bring back the euphoria of the MDMA (quite strongly if timed right) and the sexual drive is immediately there. I would not do MDMA with GHB ever - now that I know how they work together. And it always rounds out the space to be able to fuck deeply post MDMA. GHB is a radical disinhibitor as well, so makes for very raunchy and beautifully messy fucking!<br /><br />If you&#039;re partial to Charlie also, then coke + 2C-B + GHB you will find very delightful also!<br /><br />BG<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />can you give me a brief rundown of how ghb works? i dont get how it induces euphoria (havent tried it)<br />i really would like to but i also read that it can harm memory and my amphetamine use has absolutely annihilated that, so im really worried about making it any worse&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />is that only from abuse or...?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The actual mechanisms are complex (as always) and not fully understood (as always). Is a GABA agonist and also strongly affects dopamine flow - but much more going on for sure. <br /><br />It&#039;s a profound muscle relaxant, and thus relaxes emotional body armoring, and thence comes the euphoria...<br /><br />No issues with GHB and memory I&#039;ve ever heard off, and I&#039;m well-read on the subject. Feels very smooth on the brain to me personally...<br /><br />BG<br /><br />

Never understood the whole &quot;it&#039;s gay thing&quot;. Don&#039;t really see anything gay about a pretty girl making me cum hard - I mean I guess if she had invited her brother out to play with my ass that would probably qualify - but as it was she was all boobs and beautiful and it felt pretty damn good. <br /><br />I think most people just get caught up on the &quot;it&#039;s dirty&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s wrong&quot; thing but take a shower and stop letting other people tell you how to enjoy yourself. Most every girl I know has issues with ass play until I lick their bum while playing with their privates and they end up cumming like a cannon.

Not that you asked but if you want to do the dirty on MDMA I always find taking a little less helps too. Higher doses it gets real easy to get... distracted? I heard great things about post dosing MDMA with some 2CB and that was nice but it didn&#039;t really get the engine revving down there personally. Gonna try some GHB and see how that works though... otherwise Viagra isn&#039;t too hard to get, I would just clearnet it though, prices here are a little silly.

				@raynardine,<br /><br />Speaking as someone who is in two minds about everything, we find that it is most helpful to see sexuality as a kind of linear scale :<br /><br />GAY 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 STR8<br /><br />Thus&nbsp; &#039;0&#039; would be a purely &#039;Bi&#039; person, we&#039;re sure they are rare as unicorns, but out there... and we KNOW there are some fun-loving folks who race hither and yon upon the scale of sexuality, they just won&#039;t stand still long enough for a label to be stuck on their steamy bits. So if you claim sexuality is not extremely pliable then you must necessarily speak from a somewhat limited experience, and I don&#039;t mean limited in a disparaging way... it&#039;s easily remedied if you chose to open up.<br /><br />We lust after women, but we have dipped our, erm, toes in many ponds, the &#039;curious&#039; (what an inadequate word for us)&nbsp; usually do. Some of it we liked, some was ordinary. We don&#039;t feel &#039;gay&#039; or &#039;bi&#039; but may opt for being &#039;try&#039;sexual, and even then, that depends on our mood, our DoC, the set and setting, and whether they flossed.&nbsp; We do feel proud to have overcome our own fear of being gay (which once could be labeled outright homophobia on our part)&nbsp; to give it a fumble and walk away with a shrug, and then have the balls to write about it.&nbsp; He who conquers himself, and all that...<br /><br />Sexuality is as pliable as you decide you want it to be. <br /><br />That said, there&#039;s nothing wrong with being sexually limited.<br /><br />

				Holy fuck!! That makes DMT sound amazing!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10532.msg105822#msg105822">Quote from: qvel on February 07, 2012, 01:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><br />I&#039;d be interested in hearing your description if you feel like posting it.

No offense to those who like it purely vanilla, of course.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I do feel like posting it. I love sharing. I feel like the more we hide in the closet with our stories, the more we allow people who don&#039;t have our interests in mind to speak for us and &#039;re-present&#039; us (I think I can present myself pretty well, thanks).. So here goes.<br /><br />Context note: I was born a functional hermaphrodite in the early eighties, when it was still common practice to mutilate children who weren&#039;t born either fully male or fully female. Since my penis was longer than a certain length, I was &#039;assigned&#039; male, and my vagina was sealed up and the records sealed. (Military procedure)... Of course, as is usually the case, It turns out I feel more like a woman than a man (Although honestly, I don&#039;t want to lose anything I currently am packing. I&#039;ve lost enough already). Ooops. Blame the secret treatie with &quot;Red Moon Over Water Rising&quot;.<br /><br />So the first time I freebased DMT seriously.. Well, I was a bit of a pussy at first, I didn&#039;t have a mg scale, so I was eyeballing it using a straw to collect the crystals and deposit them in the pipe. I typically have an insanely high tolerance to drugs (When I was a kid, I was prescribed methamphetamine throughout puberty. You figure out what that does) Though, that runs in the family. I remember my dad never saw anything on acid until he took like five hits of &#039;orange sunshine&#039;... This was back in the day before blotter had art on it, so I&#039;m not entirely sure why they called it that.. but I digress. After several low dose attempts each of which had made me feel rather excited, giddy, and yes.. horny) took a biiiig scoop of DMT and put it in the pipe boiled it, watched fascinated as the vapor spun around in the little globe, then inhaled.<br /><br />It smelled like bones. I dunno how else to describe it, and it tingled my tissues. I didn&#039;t want to exhale, but eventually I did, and I could see the smoke just animatedly coalescing as I blew it out my mouth. I found the experience extremely erotic (Mind you, I find smoking erotic). Then everything changed. fractal geometric patterns exploded in everything. I watched my computer try to tell me that it had exceeded the maximum insanity limit.. Then it said &#039;Oh holy fuck!&#039; I became aware of an interdimensional sentience contacting me. They wanted to study me, I wanted to study them.<br /><br />I looked at the pipe. It was glowing golden, I tilted it curiously, sniffing. It was cool now, but the DMT still seemed to pulse with an energy. I inhaled on it. math flew through my brain. Infinitely complex numbers made sense. I felt overwhelmed and present in the divine Feminine force called Shakti. <br /><br />I was potently aware of the desire of the force called Shiva for me. I put the pipe down, watched the liquid dmt ooze in the base of the pipe.. I had put a whole lot in there, and now it looked curiously golden. Well.. Like blackness at the bottom of a well, with gold vapors arising from it. I smoked some hashish, felt the warmth and protectiveness of the Mothering forces of the herb, I felt my insides twist. The scar where they hurt me, it pulsed, and it hurt, but it felt warm and good too. I found myself taking the warm freebase pipe and placing it at my root chakra, the place where there is still a line where my yomi should be<br /><br />I could hear song in my ears as this happened, and my toes curled. I shivered. Holding this close against the scar where my magnetic sex should be. I felt nurtured, assured. Peaceful. I could recall the moment at birth, when what was taken from me... I could know too, that I wouldn&#039;t have to wait too much longer, that with the force of Love.. being myself (It was always my dream, this is true, to embody the form of Love, as a means of transcendence. Unconditional, unashamed, deeply passionate love.) I could return to how I am supposed to be, to how I was born.<br /><br />I poured a little of the dark goo on my fingers, and I rubbed it in my sensitive areas, in the mucous membranes. I swear I could see the energy change colours as it absorbed into me. I shivered. Oh by all the names of all the many cosmic forces I had never felt so aroused in my life. I wanted to... Well.. I wanted virile electric masculine entities to take me and penetrate me with their lust, and for beautiful magnetic women to suckle at my bosom, to drink in the psychoactive milk.<br /><br />That half a gram of DMT changed my life. Very much for the better. Everything that I am was explored, validated, comprehended. Misunderstandings were easily obliterated, &#039;gotchas&#039; of physics became amusing rather than perplexing and difficult.<br /><br />I got that from Moon Unit, it was yellow.. I didn&#039;t notice a &#039;nasty&#039; flavor. I comprehend that yellow means its only been recrystalized once, and hasn&#039;t been further purified... And it did leave an interesting carbon deposit in the bottom of my freebase pipe that is.. seemingly unremovable. it literally seems to have melded into the glass (perhaps I, in my enthusiasm, heated the glass too far. I know glass will heat up that far, and I have done this before, only not with DMT. I&#039;ve also deliberately done it while trying to learn how to blow pipes (Don&#039;t ask me to blow pipes or bowls for you. I LOVE glass blowing... But unless you want to give me a studio, an assload of glass, and time to practice, I&#039;m going to be turning out uneven sloppy bowls.&nbsp; I do know my physics though<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				This legendary fucking thread deserves resurrecting...<br /><br />So let&#039;s get some finer detail going: What is your favourite drug for increasing orgasmic intensity specifically?<br /><br />BG

				Oooh thanks for the resurrection. +1. Never seen this beast of a thread before!<br /><br />In reply to OP - I actually find that doing dissociatives, particularly ketamine and MXE, effects my sexuality in quite a strong way. Im female and identify as queer - but drugs, on more than the odd occaision have increased my attraction to the opposite sex. Never really acted on it but yeah - its like i&#039;m a reverse straight girl. You know those straight girls that get totally twatted and go out and start hitting on other girls? I think im the vice versa of that on drugs haha.<br /><br />But then, I don&#039;t really believe in gay/straight/bi anyway. Its all fluid if you want it to be. Its society that gives us those norms and ab-norms from a very early age, at a subconscious level. Maybe drugs just allow you to see things at their most basic, physical level 8)<br /><br />and in reply to your new question, BlueGiraffe, I actually haven&#039;t found a drug that increases orgasmic intensity - in fact, most drugs make me too busy being away with the faeries to even get the horn. And if I do get there, its usually a disappointment. Sober sex has always been the most effective on me, weirdly.

				Hardly any mention of mephedrone. The proper stuff makes you super horny, almost orgasm at the thought of sex and sexy talk with missus. Definitely gives you extra stamina, of course, have to do it on the come down. Did have difficulty finishing most of the time but if I persevered, the orgasm was well worth it. Also, would be rock hard the whole time!<br /><br />Other favourite was fresh hash, would get instant hard-on upon first drag.Weed is good but doesn&#039;t compare with hash. Methylone good but less so than mephedrone. 25i and 2CI ok but depending on the intensity could find it hard concentrating.<br /><br />No-ones mentioned amyl nitrate, didn&#039;t do much for me though. Apparently popular in the gay scene?
