				VPN is actually a great idea especially from countries with great privacy laws.&nbsp; All TOR traffic comes in and out from the VPN and local ISP has no idea you&#039;re using TOR.

				ok let me rephrase it all<br /><br />what i need is a VPN that takes BT (shell..duh?), that has the best track record of being low key/most amount of people (saftey in #&#039;s, dedicated IP my dick), BEST possible speed.<br /><br />XYZ WiFi+VPN+TOR is the goal. <br /><br />just rather touch n pay for one that preaches &quot;hey your safe&quot; n is more less on point. <br />Its not like imabout to DL 100gb+ of CP or w.e<br /><br />id rather NOT alert a ISP is all n hey, smile your on canded IP log right?

That said, using a VPN may hide that you are connecting to IP addresses associated with Tor, but it does not hide the fact that you are using an anonymity service. Furthermore, obfsproxy applies steganography of a sort to disguise the size of packets, Tor packets being very identifiable even if they are not being sent to known Tor node IP addresses. A VPN does not do this.

				I use feralhosting, £20 per month for GB BT connection and OpenVPN that sits on top of TOR,when I can be bothered with it, seems a little overkill. But I do use OpenVPN when wanting to bypass blocks (piratebay, newzbine, e.g.) or anything semi dodgy.<br /><br />Their site is full of step by step set ups, haven&#039;t had a problem with them in 6 months. All your ISP is seeing a lot of encrypted FTP (or none if want change it time to time) between you and hosting company. Makes me feel little safer than just BT but for little I download not great value for money. What is great is seeing Breaking&nbsp; Bad when they don&#039;t show here in UK.

				Hey let me ask one of you big-brain types out there. <br /><br />Why can&#039;t I just get a dedicated server from rackspace or somewhere and sell VPN&#039;s on it?<br /><br />Well because I can&#039;t admin, but besides that,&nbsp; how many VPN&#039;s could I push through a simple BDS or whatever box?<br /><br />Probably a lot...<br /><br />And I sure as fuck wouldn&#039;t keep any logs!<br /><br />Modzi
