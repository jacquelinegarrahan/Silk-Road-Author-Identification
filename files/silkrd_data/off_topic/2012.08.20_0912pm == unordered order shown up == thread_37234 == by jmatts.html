				A half gram of #4 herion, [that is a off white color, def herion] has shown up to me today. The wierd thing is I never ordered this. The only thing I could think of was Noriega because a couple weeks ago he sent a PM saying he was going to send the order from the 420 sale when he ripped everyone. I thought I will belive it when I see it and I did order a half gram of his Asian white herion, but he is from the NL right? Anyone know if Noreiga is paying people back and sending to US customers through a canadian vendor? If not the somehow I got a free half gram of some DAMN GOOD #4 from a Canadian vendor. Either way I&#039;m excited, it was a nice surprise!!!

				Yea I guess if u dont mind living life with your hands out, then it wouldn&#039;t be so bad...I gaurantee a begger doesn&#039;t make shit compared to a real hustle tho...I was a heroin addict for 10 yrs and never had to stoop to begger status....but wjatever I guess if it works... But u won&#039;t catch me doin that shit

				All of my responses have been very tongue-in-cheek. You may have realized that but I have not gotten that vibe from your responses. Anyways...enjoy the H. Sometimes you get lucky. Life can be nice like that sometimes, it seems.

				Yeah I really want some nice black tar. Haven&#039;t had any in a while and the vendor I was gonna buy from vanished off my radar. I may buy from Nod eventually. I have heard good things.
