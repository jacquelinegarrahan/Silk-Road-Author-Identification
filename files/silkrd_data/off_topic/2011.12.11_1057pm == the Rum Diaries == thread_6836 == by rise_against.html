				Of course I loved &quot;Fear and loathing&quot; and I enjoyed myself to see another adaptation of a Hunter S. Thompson novel with Johnny Depp. In my opinion this film sucks, it&#039;s boring, but you can still read the book which is, of course, excellent.<br /><br />WL

				I can&#039;t wait to see it. I think Depp plays Thompson perfectly, and Thompson&#039;s my idol.

				It pays to remember that Depp spent 6 months living with Thompson and was channeling him via osmosis for F&amp;L. That film came out 13 years ago; No matter how talented Depp is, and how close they were (he paid 2.5 million to see Hunter&#039;s desired &#039;funeral&#039; rites carried out) any repeat performance is going to suffer for it. <br /><br />Fear and Loathing is also not an ideal comparison for the fact that it was an apex in a writing style prefaced on manic stream-of-consciousness narrative. His journalism worked as an exaggerated version of himself, selling the story of getting the story under deadlines and bizarre circumstances. The Rum Diaries are instead a re-imagining of a period of his life without the same frantic energy, singular focus or cohesive themes we typically expect from his writing, and in fact he revised it several times since he was unable to get it published. It represents a different side of Hunter S. Thompson.&nbsp;

				Rum Diaries is semi-autobiographical, and unlike F&amp;L it takes place long before he became a drug fiend.<br />Not to mention, F&amp;L is way overstated.&nbsp; He actually wrote it drunk in a hotel room, not on a cocktail of drugs, and a good portion of it is pure fiction.&nbsp; Fun to read though.

				The film is strange, I&#039;ve never seen fear and loathing to be honest, but the rum diaries, to me showed a progressive film never amounting to anything yet still grabbed the attention till the end, the bitter sweetness of the printing works left ransacked and seemingly finished brought a&nbsp; full stop in the viewers mind. setting sail is a great end and beginning.&nbsp; its no good will hunting though.
