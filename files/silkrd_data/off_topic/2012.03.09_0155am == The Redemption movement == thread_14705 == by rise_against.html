				Title: <strong>The Redemption movement</strong><br />

				never heard of this until just today:<br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_movement<br /><br />The redemption movement consists of supporters of an American conspiracy theory.[1] Redemption theory involves claims that when the U.S. government abandoned the gold standard in 1933, the government pledged its citizens as collateral so that the government could borrow money. Other theories claim this happened in 1913 with the establishment of the Federal Reserve System. The movement also asserts that common citizens can gain access to funds in secret accounts using obscure procedures and regulations.<br /><br />According to the theory, the government created a fictitious person (or &quot;straw man&quot;) corresponding to each newborn citizen with bank accounts initially holding $630,000. The theory further holds that through obscure procedures under the Uniform Commercial Code, a citizen can &quot;reclaim&quot; the straw man and write checks against its accounts.[2] Its adherents sometimes call themselves &quot;sovereign citizens&quot;.<br /><br />There have been many well-publicized convictions of citizens attempting to take advantage of this theory. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regards the instructors and promoters of Redemption schemes as fraudsters [3] while the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has included the &quot;straw man&quot; claim in its list of frivolous positions that may result in the imposition of a $5,000 penalty[4] when used as the basis for an inaccurate tax return.[5]<br /><br />The Redemption movement is based on a theory by Roger Elvick. The theory is, in part, that for every citizen&#039;s birth certificate issued in the U.S. since the 1936 Social Security Act, the government deposits $630,000 in a hidden bank account linked to the newborn American and administered by a Jewish cabal. Redemptionists assert that by completing certain legal maneuvers and filing a series of government forms, the actual person may entitle themselves to the $630,000 held in the name of the doppelganger persona created for them at their birth, and may then access these government funds using &quot;sight drafts&quot;. The government views these sight drafts as &quot;rubber checks&quot; and the entire scheme as fraudulent. The federal government has convicted the practitioners of fraud and conspiracy.[1]<br /><br />Other important documents in this theory are the security agreement, power of attorney, copyright notice, hold-harmless agreement, Form UCC-3, notice of security agreement, birth certificate bond, Form 56 (notice concerning fiduciary relationship), Form W-8BEN (serving notice to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury of the correct status of the issuer of the bond and countering any presumption that the issuer might be considered to be a fictional entity), declaration of status, Form 1040-V, Form 1099-OID,[6][7][8] and the Notice of International Commercial Claim in Admiralty Administrative Remedy.[9] It is held, however, that the UCC-1 merely creates a rebuttable presumption, which can be overcome if a man or woman is receiving some sort of benefit from the state as a slave. It is held to be important to not sign documents such as W-4 forms, or if one is to sign them, to also write &quot;under duress&quot;.<br /><br />One element of the theory states that Americans are U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens, and can therefore avoid taxes by changing their filing status from &quot;U.S. citizen&quot; to &quot;non-resident alien&quot;. This argument has been repeatedly rejected by federal courts.[10] Classes are often set up to teach the intricacies of the theory, and books have been published about it in the underground press. Canaanite law is held to be an important source of law and The Wizard of Oz (presumably because of the scarecrow character, i.e. the &quot;straw man&quot;) and The Matrix trilogy are held to have important symbolism in reference to this theory,[11] and there is also said to be some connection to the New World Order. [12] [13]<br /><br />Redemption movement proponent Barton Buhtz has written that when a UCC form is processed by a state&#039;s UCC filing office, it becomes a public legal record/fact and that those who have filed UCC-1 Financing Statements correctly have not broken the law.[14] In October 2007, Buhtz was found guilty of conspiracy to pass approximately $3.8 million in false U.S. Treasury instruments. He was sentenced to three years in prison.[15]

				...1 year later...<br />Some call it the free-man movement, and there are as many ideas about how stuff works as there are groups of people studying the concept.&nbsp; One thing I think is that going through these obscure processes and filling out all these forms is akin to consenting to the whole process.&nbsp; That&#039;s their game, I don&#039;t give a fuck about their forms any more than I give a fuck about their corporate &quot;policies&quot; or their policy enforcement officers.&nbsp; That&#039;s all for their agents not me.&nbsp; They are accountable to us, the public.&nbsp; Truth is the government is an association and last I checked we all have freedom of association and I believe that includes the right to not associate.&nbsp; What could possibly give anyone the right to direct your life and actions?&nbsp; Because you were born in &quot;their&quot; country?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; We have the right to be born, so who can obligate us to do or refrain from doing a goddamn thing as long as we&#039;re not harming others?

				Something as bad--or worse than that--is when they decided to build roads instead of railways... Chomsky talks/writes about it. In the early days of modern America (beginning in the 1900s, I believe), sometime after the assembly line, it was decided to build roads in L.A. and California (following the population boom of the 1840s Gold Rush... hence the 49ers)--not rails, even though rails get most of their energy back on tracks...<br /><br />How much diesel does it take to move a train of supplies versus interstate tractor-trailors? Yeah, that was one of the biggest economic mistakes in American history...

				What we should do is take every car that exists in America, melt it down, and lay tracks. Then build engines instead. It would take fewer engines to move America--and more cheaply--than the cost of traffic safety.<br /><br />Automobile accidents vs. Railroad accidents<br /><br />Cost of personal insurance, versus minimal taxes... which could be incorporated into tickets... Ever been to Japan?<br /><br />Cost of accidents.<br /><br />Traffic Lights... asphalt... construction/maintenance...<br /><br />Fuel economy... global warming... profits... At this point, it&#039;s Oil Barons versus the People. Tyranny at its best.<br /><br />Lawsuits... motorist lawsuits... people vs. people.... How many airliners get sued for crashes? Fender benders? We&#039;re eating each other alive with this stupidity...

				Government is run by people, so of course it is easy to observe the fact that people are selfish--even those with the responsibility of public interest. Once in office, after the arduous public gauntlet of a public election, a person is subject to interest groups, money, material goods... more than any single citizen. There is also the social fabric of society--rich, poor, hardworking, lazy, lucky, unlucky, educated, uneducated, happy, unhappy... It&#039;s a complicated endeavor, and to discredit government and government officials without facts is very dangerous. The American Revolution (AR) put lots of facts together. Thomas Paine, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and many others, were prolific writers. What they started with, however, was frustration. They saw the world as inherently dangerous and threatening, and they recognized problems in the world.<br /><br />Turn your frustration into the helping hand, like our forefathers did. Never stop reading. Never stop thinking. Never give up.
