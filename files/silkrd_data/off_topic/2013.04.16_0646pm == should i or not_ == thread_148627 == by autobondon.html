We as a community are here to help.<br />It&#039;s really a huge gamble at this point. I only recommend investing in bitcoin if you are ready to bulldog it and wait it out. Could be months maybe even a year before it really pays off, but it will, eventually. Most people do agree that they believe the bitcoin will raise above 100$ again so I say it&#039;s a good move.<br /><br />Chaos

Not at the present time anyway. I think it will go down in price still/ I may be wrong, but that&#039;s just my thoughts.

Do you think they will dip a bit further than they have.... If I can quote Flush&#039;s sig., &#039;Know when to held em and when to fold em&#039;. It is possible the rate will go down even further than it has, but my advice is it is sometimes better to sacrifice a scintillating profit at high risk to a lower but guaranteed profit at low risk. I have almost never been greedy with my decision-making in this regard and I have rarely lost even if profit margins have been smaller than what I could have made. I jump ship early and cut out the free-fall because I am content to have 5 dollars profit than to risk 10 and end up with none. I have only ever lost huge twice. And both times I was blind or greedy or both. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s been my experience. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
