				Hello, I&#039;d like to know whether some drugs exist, which are not that potent like coke etc., but also rise up the serotonine/dopamin level? The reason for my question is because it seems too dangerous to me to exaggerate the use of serotonine/dopamin receptors because they could be &quot;hurt&quot; or shutdown.<br />For example meth has the 3.5x serotonin concentration in comparison to coke. I am searching something that has even less than coke.<br /><br />For example ritalin could be a way to go. Any others?<br /><br />Thank you all in advance.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english :( Couldn&#039;t find a better explanation.

				Your question is not that clear, are you looking for a drug that will get you high but not stress your brain out too much?<br /><br />I think your concern is with all the excessive dopamine and serotonin release you will be effecting the levels of the receptors and other down regulation... which has been shown and much of the discussion of neurotoxicity is related to these lasting cellular changes<br /><br />All drugs work by affecting on of these systems, and anything that increases the level of a neurotransmitter can be subject to mechanisms countering the effect... so the key is just to use them in moderation. if you take a potent drug, but then give your body time to process and return to normal before consuming more, then you will not quickly cause these changes in significant amounts. Raising the levels of , norep, or dopamine and receptor changes are not inherently bad (this is what anti-depressants do) but meth can deplete the stores which causes actual damage to the cell... <br /><br />Any and all drugs that make you feel good are going to target these serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, even if only downstream... but they will basically all lead to tolerance, but this does not indicate necessarily &quot;toxicity.&quot; For a recommendation for drug, it really depends on what effects you want... if you want a stimulant, ritalin which is a dopamine re-uptake transporter inhibitor will cause similar effects as cocaine, which is also a DAT inhibitor. Amphetamine could be used sparingly without too much impact. I think meth has more of an effect on the SERT transport, as does MDMA which cause the increase in serotonin, than amphetamine but I am not completely sure. If you want to use a psychedelic, these actually generally work on the receptors directly, instead of dumping vesicular contents into the cleft through reversal of the transporters... and and some of the least toxic drugs you can take. They will dramatically interfere with the normal firing of the neurons, which patterns can become more likely and produce HPPD after heavy use. <br /><br />Even benzos will raise levels of dopamine, by impacting the gabanergic sites on inhibitory neurons, causing disinhibition and the release of dopamine and serotonin downstream producing the pleasurable effects some experience, but these certainly are not directly as stressful or cause as large of a change.

				Thank you very much for that post.<br />I&#039;m basically searching for an effective, not-so-harmful anti-depressant to cure my very bad depressive mood, which wants me to not live any longer.<br />I could easily consume XTC every day, heroine, coke and so on but as everyone know: The side effects are too heavy and overweigh the possible benefits.<br />I tried prescription ADs like citalopram (SSRI), but they didn&#039;t work at all.<br />I really don&#039;t know, what I should or can do to have a normal life &quot;again&quot;.<br />MXE for example didn&#039;t work either.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to ruin my life or make it even worse with the really bad drugs which include neurotoxic ones, because it&#039;s senseless to me and I would consider suicide instead of doing those substances.<br /><br />I collected some drugs over the weeks, which could cure depression:<br />Ayahuasca<br />LSD<br />Mushrooms<br />DMT<br />ritalin<br />Survextor / Amin√©ptine<br /><br />but I don&#039;t know, which one could be the best or if there are any others<br /><br />Kind regards.
