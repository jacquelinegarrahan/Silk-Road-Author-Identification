				a guy placed an order for 1 gram of cocaine.<br /><br />the guy had impressive buyer stats. <br /><br />I told him that I needed him to finalize early and that there were 3 options:<br /><br />&quot;cancel the order and send payment directly (advised)<br />continue and wait 2 or 3 days before it will allow you to finalize (stupid new feature)<br />cancel the order.&quot;<br /><br />He told me:<br /><br />&quot;absolutely not, thats totally against SR policy and you have done nothing on here to warrant any sort of trust from anyone looking to purchase from you. your circumvention of SR guidelines is also as blatant as can be so ill refer you to buyer guidelines.<br /><br />Things to avoid<br />Below is a short list of specific things you should avoid. It is by no means exhaustive, but taking any one of these actions could get your seller priviledges revoked:<br /><br />Directing your customers to pay outside the escrow system or in currencies other than Bitcoin<br /><br />please note that i have been on here for a long time as you will have seen from my buyer info so i will be reporting you to SR support.&quot;<br /><br />Blah blah blah. Whatever. I gave him the opportunity to cancel the order. It seems a bit harsh to report a new seller over ONE GRAM of cocaine! If I get my seller privileges revoked, I have lost a fair bit of money that I spent on a seller account. So who is wrong in this? Me or him?

				If he has good stats and the purchase is over something as small as a gram.. and you don&#039;t want to sell in escrow..

				Use a DCN so you can prove to SR admins that you actually shipped the item. Even with the old #1 seller on the SR, Tony76, he asked buyers to FE, and he split and never sent the last of his shipments on the 4/20 scale. <br /><br />The escrow system isn&#039;t the BEST, but its damn close. Like someone above stated, you need 35 transactions before you can ask. <br /><br />If you aren&#039;t going to be willing to send 1g of coke, then maybe start with smaller product.

				This site is based on escrow.&nbsp; All of it&#039;s reputation and the good will of&nbsp; certain outside goups, is based on the fact that it protects people from scammers.&nbsp; People like the site, but then want to play by their own rules.&nbsp; We&#039;re sick of getting ripped off.&nbsp; The sad fact is that too many people are willing to go outside escrow and then when they get ripped off, want somebody to step in.&nbsp; All new vendors--and buyers--should be forced to read the whole Tony76 thread, before being allowed to sell or buy product.&nbsp; <br /><br />Every rip off that comes here says good things, they&#039;re always humble, kind, helpful...and they *always* find a way to get buyers outside of escrow.&nbsp; We&#039;re tired of it.&nbsp; There are plenty of other sites without our protections.&nbsp; I suggest vendors that don&#039;t like our rules go elsewhere.

				I agree that FE should be banned. This would cut out the un-serious vendors and then we would have honerable vendors. As it is , we have to search for good people to buy from through the deep pools of shrk infested waters. Thanks Dayna for letting us know where you stand.

				i really wanted to play good guy and defend this guy even after his unacceptable behavior but the more i think about i the more angry i get. i asked for her to make another listing so i could attempt to order the legit way. never happened. everything about this vendor screams scammer and i really dislike having to be the one to bring it up. get rid of this FE bullshit unil DPR can implement system where when someone FE&#039;s with a vendor it goes into a bank account until everything is legitimate and then is released to vendors. so many smart people on this website and yet stilll motherfuckers like tony making off with at least $100,000.

				There is no need to completely get rid of FE. sometimes it has its uses, like someone mentioned before they FE for things like lotteries.<br />Its really up to the buyers to choose not to FE. Buyers do have the power of the market and if people are smart enough to simply avoid any seller asking for FE then those sellers wont make any money. If they aren&#039;t making money they will either change or leave. simple.
