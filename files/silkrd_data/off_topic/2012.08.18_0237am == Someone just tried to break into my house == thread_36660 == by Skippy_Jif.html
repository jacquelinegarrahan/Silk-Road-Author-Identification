				#1 reason I moved to the sticks. Break-ins and invasions were commonplace. Left one morning at 4am with the better half still asleep only to catch a crack head prying the back door. He took off but I still wonder if I could have pulled the trigger. It&#039;d been years since I was active duty but I imagine it&#039;s all muscle memory. We moved three days later.<br /><br />

You question whether or not you have lost the skills to fire your weapon effectively? Why haven&#039;t you taken a trip to the range or done some live fire drills to sharpen your skills and boost your confidence? No sense owning a weapon if you doubt your ability to use it.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m wrong. Maybe you could explain to me what the purpose of owning a deadly weapon would be if you weren&#039;t sure you could use it to defend yourself, your loved ones, or your property?

				USA: Burglars get shot.&nbsp; 8)<br />UK: We politely ask burglars to leave without hurting their feelings thus causing emotional trauma and infringing on their human rights, possibly leaving you open to prosecution. Oh, and don&#039;t forget to remind them about the vandal grease on your walls, if it damages their clothing as they flee you may have to pay laundry fees.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Remember vividly that my folks got broke into when I was about 8 yrs old, my dad ran at them with a hammer, cowards shit themselves and ran for it. For the best tho, he would have probably done time inside if he hit one of them hard enough... These days I sleep with a large hunting knife and a hefty maglite by my bed. I&#039;d have no problem defending my property and those who dwell inside, even if I have to do time. Obviously try and scare the cunts away before resorting to violence, but the problem here is that guns are getting really prevalent, even among teenage &#039;gangs&#039; (not even organized criminal gangs, just groups of kids who like to cause shit) whilst the general public seem to have no way of defending themselves as those ill-bread shits run riot shooting at eachother in built up areas because someone stole a rival &#039;gang&#039; member BMX.&nbsp; ::)
