				Not to be a dick but the price has only fallen 5 dollars or so since monday and you claim to need .61 which is 70 dollars give or take.. Sounds like your just asking for a loan and hoping someone will &quot;feel for ya&quot; and make the loan.. Not saying your trying to scam but with what you typed, it looks that way..

				well it was going to an order and so the first person i asked was the vendor since it was a large order and we have some history together so the vendor actually sent me the extra funds to make the order from him haha but if someone from the forums wouldve loaned it i def wouldve paid it back, i believe in real karma not just the plus and minues under our names . plus this is a great community and im a happy to be a part of it and i wouldnt have scammed a fellow roader $100 when im about to make bank on an order

This should not be needed. Thank you for point out this site and those work around solutions though. I am interested but I have to say I am uncertain about the integrity of the site when they require unique IP registrations.
