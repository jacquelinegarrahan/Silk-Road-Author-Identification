				I find that over the last couple of years the Canadian pill scene has died. If you look at pillreports you can see that almost every single pill is either pipes or amphetamine. Does anyone know what has caused all these people to press shit into pills and label them as MDMA? Even 2-3 years ago I never managed to come across pipes. Thank god theres loads of molly flooding the city ... no quality that can be compared to SR though. It&#039;s usually Okay at best.

				I dunno what the deal is, but it&#039;s the same on the east coast.<br />Almost all pills sold here are on pillreports warning list.<br /><br />Chemical Bros has some sweet Triforce M that are highly rated, and the packaging is stealth.<br />I don&#039;t know about the red defcons, they seem popular and many vendors sell &#039;em.

I was thinking of buying some of them. Apparently the only pill that rivals them are the white speakers. I&#039;ve had the red defqons and they&#039;re pretty sick, but I&#039;ve heard they fall closely behind the triforce/speakers in terms of quality.

				Yeah the east coast is a wasteland when looking for decent ecstasy. I&#039;m not too interested in pressed pills anymore after an unfortunate pipe dose that I took like an idiot. I stick to the crystals now and SKYY seems to be my best bet for ordering from the NL. I might give it a go but I&#039;m still skeptical for ordering from NL. I usually stick to domestic.

				It&#039;s like there&#039;s no more rollers out there. I don&#039;t know. I had some good shit when I was in central time but that was a few years ago. And where I reside now, no way I can get anything good. <br /><br />

				Thank god all the Canadian speed presses are white and easy to spot out... I feel bad for the people who don&#039;t know this and might double drop a white pill... I&#039;m not sure they&#039;d be in for a fun ride. Two ICE pills at once would definitely have me worried.

I think mixing the white presses with mdma crystal is the way to go. Not healthy but at least you know more or less what you&#039;re getting. In my opinion a good &quot;sketchy pill&quot; is just real mdma and speed mixed at a nice ratio. Sometimes people complain that white speed has too much meth, but I would say that&#039;s what you want in those.
