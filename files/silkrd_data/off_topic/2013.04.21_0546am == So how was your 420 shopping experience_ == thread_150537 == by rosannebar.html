				Did you find any good deals?&nbsp; Spend a lot of coin today?&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I was a little let down by the lack of vendors having any type of sales,&nbsp; however I did run across a good hash deal, and spent a good part of the day checking back and checking back for anything new.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wbu?

				Ended up not getting anything for 4/20. I don&#039;t really need anything (took care of what I needed a couple days ago) plus there wasn&#039;t many vendor deals anyway.

				Morning everyone, I was able to order something for a dollar so that was cool. All my monies were spent IRL buying marijuana, it was fun.
