				50g ground mimosa hostilis was added to a 3 litre erlenmeyer containing 25g citric acid dissolved in 500ml acetone the solution was stirred every now and then and left in a warm place (not boiling) and filtered off the mimosa (reuse 2-3 times) keeping only the saturated acetone containing the DMT citrate, FASA(10g fumaric acid dissolved into 500ml acetone (20mg/ml) which takes up to 24h to dissolve all) was added (1g fumaric acid = 3.43g DMT fumarate, mimosa will contain about 1% alkaoids) to the erlenmeyer, always add more FASA then needed, will be washed out later anyway.<br />After 3 days the solution was filtered (clean acetone and reuse to lower costs) the DMT fumarate was allowed to dry, an equal portion of sodium carbonate was dissolved into 10ml water and heated to 40C to dissolve all crystals, the solution should be milky coloured, leave it until no more precitipation of the free base, recrystallize product from hot xylene. yield: 500mg<br /><br />References: DMT-Neuxs

				Great write up, however I think the base extraction has a couple of advantages for the home chemist. <br /><br />First of all you would need dry acetone. Acetone by itself is hygroscopic and contains a couple % of water. With 500 ml this is equal to about 5 - 10 ml. This will dissolve the salt of DMT. <br /><br />Also the fumaric acid is not as easy to acquire as lye for example. At least not where I live. <br /><br />However, I like this tech more than the old one, because with lye there is a pretty big change of the formation of stupid emulsions. Maybe this can be overcome by adding NaCl to the mixture, to give the water layer a higher density. <br /><br />So I think there are a few sidenotes on this tech, you need dry acetone and some chems may not be very easily acquired.<br /><br />In time I will give this tech a go. I still have some MHRB laying around.
