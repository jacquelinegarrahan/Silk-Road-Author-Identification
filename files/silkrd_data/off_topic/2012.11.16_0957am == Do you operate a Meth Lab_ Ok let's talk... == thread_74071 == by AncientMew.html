				Basically I&#039;ve been reading up on meth labs recently and find the whole clandestine side to it very, very interesting. I&#039;m a journalist and want to interview someone or some people who currently operate a meth lab.<br /><br />Of course you will think I&#039;m crazy and that I&#039;m a NARC or something. I&#039;m already anticipating the &quot;dude what a fucking idiot&quot; type replies, but that&#039;s the whole reason I&#039;m posting here--to somehow gain trust to do this. <br /><br />I have interviewed very high profile criminals, left-wing terrorists, insurgents etc and have never exposed any of my sources, despite being arrested and held in various countries many times. If anything, I like to make it so I literally don&#039;t know how to contact my sources after the story has been published, that way TPTB can&#039;t even waterboard it out of me.<br /><br />Anyway, I am sure there are meth lab operators browsing this forum who have put together an impressive lab and would be somewhat interested in sharing their story with me for VICE. If you are such a person I can send many pieces of evidence that I can be trusted to you, that will make it obvious I am not a NARC, undercover agent or anything of the sort. <br /><br />If anyone here can help me gain some information on speaking with impressive meth lab operators please let me know by emailing ancientmew@tormail.org.<br /><br />My PGP key is below.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBFCTl4oBCAC7bUKz0UhfumNE5yZ0/3oUcIEJosL4qIsfNmgRvoH/PR+3QOCt<br />flRVGdp0GGZNB+4Sl03377x19SAX2ISVt/v1xgnRrx54Q3tewbhqDlBJFfWG1okv<br />VYzvdJ1+3Fvg9EKuhCAwTkR9HK8NGX2Y9m0AWoxiZpVS4MoXT7VKi8GbpzNZuLc0<br />6FXnQXt/9f/FUuHoqS7KQhin/eDZgnp18dmaLyHKt7yw5saYhW6WKFmn8ippEWxC<br />sAUfiINJ5g58Pt0/CCbZOlIOmyIh5yUFwB1oMZaRU4UlaWT9AX/5mco1kV1QWzeB<br />ckeNF5rwfT/BX8QmkMVYlGu4H92/1d+z93KzABEBAAG0JEFuY2llbnQgTWV3IDxh<br />bmNpZW50bWV3QHRvcm1haWwub3JnPokBOAQTAQIAIgUCUJOXigIbAwYLCQgHAwIG<br />FQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQn/WemkXrFfjuqAf/UuhqRvL8hn8y/KNpZB+t<br />1go4oqm+GKXm/crzz92hXVWOL6kgRv7U8NLAX2pe0+T/prsgGaSzBnee+WFDpuBb<br />450UGoQxkuSexbnt3H0DCjuCGHqoPAHDzLE3hldn4wzlCKR7ZK1Q33CVzvSlenz9<br />db7wsYpZf71DUPZWymjaXpvlUMg1U7UU5dE2cYnD6ufQPi3N0wtp1lWfe+ySxQBI<br />fWYo20m+N1aB2bGpZh8zf3jnZy2RbAMhNLaIn/EedYcwA7OF/vyIsEQbCwicw497<br />hJL7aigggjlQYqC5Jo1Wg/h4JssP9pbolF1tE7oD0zhf/9LCIerO/LIO8yxpbFFt<br />UbkBDQRQk5eKAQgAlZXC6O6gjkDMciuY13MYZ3jlwI6jtWuY+a6tB1lohFF8jhu8<br />r5r6ML70abilZYXTYNzQSAtRYpArLV1t7dc5Q9cfOkkUmPgpL+PjTbnGGn4ctF0d<br />xR6O8lGlr5IEZtV97H2ChJHPMi5PwNXUCenFtsYbw9oVviQ/YqBmitWlf39QzFYp<br />FKYMWgW7v0aFBVgQytvmyOM1wCHVWKKf+e6Atz3Sg6T64oBVxPucc62UhE3g9Cfv<br />98nmeDVLjFO10wAbKHQZAfmOYWJLsY3C5QtTAm40DHw5VspCTWfIwhCDK3zrVzyw<br />YfR/CDHaFGkiaWTFNnjn1ZABMeZ+spizCsdRMwARAQABiQEfBBgBAgAJBQJQk5eK<br />AhsMAAoJEJ/1nppF6xX4VKsH/2zJ1Dmcxh7naIi0d57sgOk/0uhoHrqkg/OeH47l<br />uy2Ltjds0o6p+Wm6SXmXL2LcBIISOCGBYA4BiYjERUffSHXyjRjn+c9e7yp+7UcS<br />e0KrK87C9Npf3CzR164qPsonIFH294lQaL0G1OshEi+cEGuVpld4bCpyVz9rvBjx<br />krEJA5JmvWPIoby496qYfHX9jQK3zzmhQ63oiD0Thgu/HFKYk6J9tZV2uXVJDl7s<br />s/gdcWLZAW6X/OyynzO899mYp14r1jaZsGN2qWt6EdEoOcOuxg5BT92yUqLiFsv9<br />aPMJQAzXiJXNu2ko+e0U9E7e0R5x1qTpnMI2eh4n2PhGI9c=<br />=fnDw<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;d doubt someone would be running a meth lab while being a vendor on SR at the same time.<br /><br />Isolating the suppliers and the distributors is essential for security and longevity... and both are time expensive.<br /><br />There might be a few purchasers exchanging precursors on here. But there&#039;s no way to verify that with a profile. Plus I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty bedroom cooks who would love to bullshit you about running labs. Or with stories of a &quot;guy they know&quot;.<br /><br />Either way, VICE I liked your video interviewing the NYC dealer. Just please don&#039;t mention SR. First rule of fight club.

				I love VICE, but oh god, if they mention Silk Road this place is going to explode.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure you&#039;re going to find the huge meth lab you&#039;re looking for. I read somewhere that around 90% of meth is from Mexico, and good luck ever getting a hold of those guys.<br /><br />Good luck though. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not impossible, I watched some Youtube videos a while ago where they busted a huge meth and ecstacy lab in Canada so I guess it&#039;s possible to find something like what you&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />If anyone here on SR actually runs a place like this and would like to have VICE over but is afraid of LE, I suggest having an acquaintance call Shane Smith personally and ask him if it&#039;s legit. Don&#039;t do it yourself of course.<br /><br />Send a PM to Limetless, I&#039;m pretty sure he knows some mephedrone cooks although it&#039;s a long shot. Hard to get someone to risk everything for a media report and some cash

				I&#039;ve operated labs in the past and am a precursor vendor on SR, If this is really for vice im guessing you would want to meet irl? Most people who have operated labs and browse these forums would not be willing to meet. But getting some type of email interview would be easy.

				I know less than nothing about meth, but I just had to say I love VICE so much it hurts! And if you are the author I think you are, you have written good articles about subjects I have an interest in. I&#039;m no help though, sorry.

				Thanks for the positive replies guys. I must say I am shocked, I half expected to get trolled.<br /><br />Firstly, let me answer some concerns/comments being expressed.<br /><br />1. No we would not have to meet in person, but I would need photos of the lab and some kind of proof it&#039;s yours.<br /><br />2. I will not be mentioning Silk Road in my piece. I actually think this place does a good service to drug users and wouldn&#039;t want to ruin it.<br /><br />3. There is actually little risk involved here. If you send me PGP emails, if I was an FBI guy (which I am not, I will share with you who I am and all my work if your are the man with the meth lab) I wouldn&#039;t be able to trace you. Also I am not asking for real name, or even a strict location, I just want to know how you got into it, why you do it, what money you make, that sort of thing. I think it&#039;s very interesting. I&#039;m not judgmental on drugs so most definitely would be writing this piece for the narrative, not to talk shit about or to anyone.<br /><br />Please, someone get in contact and test me out, I promise you I am no NARC or any other of those undercover drug dealing officials.<br /><br />And to the person saying call Shane Smith, do you really think he knows about all the 10000&#039;s of writers freelancing for VICE? Plus journalists don&#039;t pitch the article until it is concrete. I am reaching out on a limb.

				Nice try DEA.<br /><br />Who in their right mind would want to be interviewed by anyone? Is your cock too small? Need to validate yourself and feel special? Why would you want to put out ANY education on any of this subject to anyone outside of the Silk Road landscape? The more attention you draw (and YES, this guy WILL mention silk road, it wouldn&#039;t be interesting journalism if he left out where he dug this information up) to this scene, the more and more of a shit-hole it will become. <br /><br />Don&#039;t do it. Just exchange your goods, make money, and be done with it. Don&#039;t be an attention-starved child.

You sound very angry.<br /><br />They would do the interview because they have led a clearly interesting life and might want to share the mad shit that happened. Storytelling, it&#039;s been going on since people lived in caves pal.<br /><br />Believe it or not Silk Road is not clandestine in any way shape or form any more. Most people know about it, mentioning it in an article would not make it more interesting, in fact it would be kinda lame to be honest. As a journalist I don&#039;t go into depth about my research, that defeats the whole object of journalism. You do your research and then present the story with the information you&#039;ve gathered, you don&#039;t tell people how you got it all, that&#039;d be pretty pompous and incredibly long winded. <br />Besides most people can&#039;t be bothered to work out the Bitcoin stuff anyway. <br /><br />The person who may have the meth lab would obviously not share their own personal information or name, therefore making it very much selfless and not an attention seeking act at all.

				It&#039;s very unlikely this guy is LE, LE wouldn&#039;t bother with something like this, they aren&#039;t likely to get a real fish from it, much more likely to catch some small timer that knows what they are doing but doesn&#039;t have real experience in production.<br /><br />Its also very unlikely this guy is a journalist.&nbsp; Journalists study language and writing extensively, and most of them unconciously use quite superb grammar and sentence structure, even in a forum post.<br /><br />I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;ve only given this thread a cursory viewing, but I&#039;d say its most likely that this guy is trying to get into the meth game himself, but doesn&#039;t know the secrets that allow for safe, cost effective production.&nbsp; I think its pretty safe to take him up on his offer, but it&#039;ll only result in another competing cook :)

				Everyone posting GTFO and &quot;are you stupid&quot; comments... leave it to the people that actually know about the subject and can make their own informed decision on weather they want to talk or not.. It´s not up to you to tell anyone to get off the forums. We are a community and make community decisions, if it were left to youre small minded judgements SR would not exist. <br />He has clearly stated he is not LE, He has clearly stated that IRL contact is not necessary, he has provided ample information and is willing to give more to rest assurances, IT WAS HIM that offered all comms to be PGP secured, he has been clear from the start... so unless you own a Meth lab or ship precursors to a lab and have a vested interest in having your story heard then don´t comment for the sake of sounding clever..&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a contact on here in europe that was in a partner operation not long ago, he/she has not been selling for almost 4 months now so I am not sure how viable a lead he/she would be or if the lab is still operational. The operation ran something like.. His/Her partner ran a lab out of a house on the west side of the country, order was shipped to the centre where He/She fulfilled orders. As far as I understand it, the lab was not some expensive set up like breaking bad, more like two rooms on the upper floor of a country house near the coast relatively out of the way used for cooking and the rest of the house made too look fairly abandoned, top two rooms were locked when the cook had finished and had steel plated doors and large bars to reinforce. If someone had really wanted to break in they could have, but would have been enough to stop tramps etc.. Cook would only go there to cook the same amount needed in the last fulfillment of orders when it was done the windows were sealed doors closed and left for the next cook. I think the setup was fairly basic, they used an ephedrine / phosphorus recepie and equipment was sources from a school and other bits bought online to the shipping address. <br /><br />I have been unsuccessful at contact with this person for the past month, I´m a bit worried that something has happened, cell is off and no response though tormail.. I will keep trying and if I do make contact I will refer to this post and he/she can make a decision to contact. <br /><br />Hope this helps. <br />ACE

				The following forums may or may not be of interest to you...&nbsp; Just depends on what kind of information you&#039;re seeking.&nbsp; Both sites require registration to access any content.<br /><br />https://wetdreams.ws/forum/index.php.<br />https://www.thevespiary.org/talk/index.php<br /><br />The subject material of both forums is primarily methamphetamine manufacture.&nbsp; Wetdreams is more for the beginning home chemist; the Vespiary is populated with more experienced clandestine chemists, all of whom seem to possess an intellectual arrogance at least equal to their knowledge of chemistry, which is far beyond my own.<br /><br />Anyway...
