				Back in 2006, I remember paying £20 for 1/8th. Now it&#039;s almost double that. What happened?

				Everything on SR is premium price, that is you are paying a higher price for the ease of access, discreet shipping etc. Your risk is reduced as you are not buying off someone who could mug you for your phone, the quality is going to be better etc.<br /><br />Obviously £40 for an eigth is excessive if the weed is just weed but a decent indoor grown smoke is probably going to be wirth it.<br /><br />If that is still too expensive you may be better off buying on the street.<br /><br />I hope to have an active vendor accoubt after the weekend and will be listing some SAGE and Vanilka Kush, as sativa strains they yield less, take longer to mature and take up more space (than an indica dominant strain) the price will reflect that, but for the same reasons i just mentioned these strains are unlikely to be available on the street as they are not as commercially successful.

As well, what with the emergence of synthetic weed, surely the demand would have waned a little.

The thing is, if people are buying, why would anyone lower the prices ? Once people stop buying weed that expensive, prices will lower. <br /><br />Same goes for most of other drugs here, overpriced, but I still buy them. I get the weed elsewhere, because of its large availability and better prices in my hometown. <br /><br />As for the emergence of synthetic weed, I believe it didn&#039;t affect the market much, because of its nasty effects and its difference from smoking real weed. Only a few truly enjoy getting wrecked on synthetic weed I guess.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Another reason is simple economics.<br /><br />In 2006 petrol cost 88.9p per litre. £20 would have bought you 22.5 litres, now petrol is 134.1p per kitte, so £20 in 2012 buys you 14.9 litres.<br /><br />Tl;dr - inflation

				Federal Reserve Bank and other similar Central Banking constructs have interjected interest free, non commodity backed currency into the economy. The denominator has grown and the tax payers have not received a compensation to balance out that inflation. So in turn, we are being silently taxed and robbed.<br /><br />In the case of the United States, the perpetual spending on Endless War(s) in the Middle East have incurred the most damage to the middle class and shows no sign of stopping at any point. Since the Bush Administration in 2000, the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar has lost over 90% of its value. Since the U.S. Dollar is the global business monetary exchange, it consequently affects other countries and their economy. (According to the BRICS 2012 Summit*1 this year, China is wanting to replace the international trade currency to the Yuan.*2 If that happens, the U.S. will spiral into a hyper inflation since we have no commodity backing the Dollar)<br /><br />In turn all of this correlates to the price of Weed going up. Since growers and dealers are subject to the same price increase of goods and services to survive as we, consumers, are too; they adjust their prices accordingly. I don&#039;t see any of this changing unless the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power or we have past Peak Oil*3 and the unsustainable population suffers a drastic decline to where the Earth is once again in harmony and people are forced to focus on survival instead of being dickheads.<br /><br />1*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_BRICS_summit<br />2*http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/04/12/china-yuan-inches-closer-to-global-currency/<br />3*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil<br /><br />
