Even all the NBOMe derivatives don&#039;t come close to how intensely powerful and life-changing LSD can prove to be.<br /><br />Take 700-1000ug of 2C-b, sure, have a blast. Clenchy, cold, rapid OEVs with circular thoughts and a feeling of dizziness and uncertainty.<br /><br />Take 200ug of LSD, have a remarkable experience, absolutely stunning OEVs and CEVs, mind-broadening introspective thoughts, creative links made that would seem otherworldly in any other setting. LSD, right up there with Psilocybin, are the absolute fucking kings of Psychedelics, and none of these pop-trips and psydingers and psypoles and tryptamines are going to come close to it.<br /><br />Just fuck around with your LSD doses people. Learn to know what levels of thought and pleasure you can experience with taking up the dose or taking down the dose. Set and Setting. There are too many variables to an acid trip to say that it can be categorised as one exact experience.<br /><br />I personally say, fuck the 2C/NBOMe&#039;s. My first psych trip was with Felix&#039;s about 2 years ago, and it was just dirty. Rapid, uncertain, not at all subtle or enjoyable, just too much intensity of sensory perception without any clarity or pleasure. <br /><br />Had actual LSD about 5 months later, was blown away. &quot;SO THIS IS WHAT ACID FEELS LIKE&quot;.<br /><br />nothing comes close to it,
