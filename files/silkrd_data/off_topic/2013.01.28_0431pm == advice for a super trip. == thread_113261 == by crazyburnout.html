				okay people for some reason i feel like i can never trip hard enough. dont get me wrong, i trip just fine but i always want it to get stronger. so im coming up with an idea. i need some input from you people on whether or not this is a bad idea or if im just gonna kill myself or whatever. i wanna get my hands on pretty much every basic psychedelic there is and take them in one day. start with like a 5 grams of shrooms. couple hours later like 3 or 4 hits of acid. a bit of mescaline which i have never done before.( i just did acid for the first time saturday) and somewhere amid all that take a hit or 2 of dmt when i am peaking on 1 or more of those.&nbsp; will that be a wild trip or will my brain just fry and not be able to receive full effects of the drugs? or will i just die? i need input thanks

				You sir are ambitious.&nbsp; Well considering it was your first time on LSD on saturday and this will be your first time on mescaline, I would tone it back a bit.&nbsp; I&#039;m all about your mission and can&#039;t say I haven&#039;t always wanted to have that wild out of the box trip, but be careful with all that.&nbsp; I had a day where I ate like 2.5gs of shrooms, about 5 hits of acid, smoked some dmt and had a little 2cb.&nbsp; Awesome day, one of the best in my life.&nbsp; Now mescaline I&#039;m not too versed in, so I don&#039;t know how that interacts so much and thats what I worry about, I&#039;m sure someone on here will be able to give you better advice on the mix.&nbsp; But I would definatly suggest toning it down as your amounts are quite ambitious.&nbsp; Psychedelics are a delicate realm, theres a thin line between what in the fuck yea to o fuck no.&nbsp; I mean only you truly know what you can handle and all that and I&#039;m not sure your experience with psychedelics but just be careful, I would definatly have a trip buddy on this one and xanex on hand.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you&#039;d die from this, but if may fuck with your mental.&nbsp; That&#039;s my 2 cents, be safe, have fun. ::)

It will be intense and insightful and might be too much for anyone.<br /><br />Be aware of cross-tolerance - it is apparently quite strong between LSD and shrooms. Not so sure about mescaline, but I would imagine that it is too.<br /><br />I just realised that the most important thing I would like to write here is a question - why do you feel compelled to do it? what is it in this trip that you hope to achieve?

If you look on SR many a tab would be 70 - 90 micrograms and then your 10 tabs would be 700 micrograms - serious dose for many people, but there are people who would find it to be a &quot;museum level&quot;. I personally struggled to get anywhere at all on my first attempts with less than 600 micrograms ... now I do not need that much! But watch out for your set and setting ... simple chase for a dose is likely to result in you hitting the right level at the perfect time when you should NOT have been doing it. Also, doing it more often than once a week will build your tolerance.<br /><br />But the best thing is that it is hard to overdose on LSD-25, so go for a big dose and get ready for that ego death ... scary and amazing experience!

				in my opinion you are going to be wasting sum good shit. You will have to wait 2 weeks to trip again because the tolerance you have will be killed out plus you will only get so high from some of that stuff before your tolerance is peaked at that time. If you are already not getting enough trips then you may want to wait a while already. I know it sux but it&#039;s reality. Just smoke some weed til your tolerance is ready

Mescaline is not normally considered as an amphetamine because it does not affect the central nervous system in the same way that most other amphetamines do. The exact mechanism of action for mescaline is unknown. Mescaline&#039;s chemical formula is very similar to the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine. It is theorized that mescaline affects the way that these neurotransmitters interact in the brain.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i would have to disagree with you saying it&#039;s harder on the body than other psychedelics. mescaline was extremely gentle to me, even more so than lsd or mushrooms. everyone&#039;s chemistry is different, however. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Certainly. I was speaking relatively. Relative to LSD and mushrooms, mescaline is hard on the body and has a high level of toxicity. Relative to stimulants in general, yes, mescaline is gentle on the body and has a very low toxicity.
