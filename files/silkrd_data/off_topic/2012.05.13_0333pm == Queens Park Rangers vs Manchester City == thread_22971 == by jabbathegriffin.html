				Great end to the season.<br /><br />Man Utd had the title in the bag but lost it due to their own mistakes.<br /><br />And you could have seen this game of any free on vip box sports. Costs nothing. I never run any software just watch ALL the games.<br /><br />Glad Man Utd gave their neighbors an historic win.<br /><br />

That game was bad ass- seriously made me a legit fan. I am going to have to try and find more time to watch the sport

				Not a fan of either Manchester side, but I&#039;m quite anti-Man City considering they pretty much bought the league, despite some players they received for peanuts compared to their ability, like Kompany.

Lerner spent some money on a few players sure, but that&#039;s the way of the game, to me there is a difference between investing in a handful of players to reshape your team, add depth, etc than it is to go the route of Chelsea, or more so Man City, and purchase a completely new side. Aston Villa also, formerly successfully in doing so, had several top quality English talent coming through it&#039;s ranks. Aston Villa is a selling team though, and when they do purchase they purchase poorly (Reo-Coker). This might be the first season in a while that Villa&#039;s top performer won&#039;t be moving to Manchester, after Barry, Milner and Young.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just transfer fees though, Manchester Utd VASTLY overspends on mediocre talent, Man City had to have offered some mind boggling wages to some of these players to get them from under the noses of clubs who were already competing in the CL.

Really surprised Arsenal managed to finish in a CL spot though.<br /><br />Best news though? That McLeish may be sacked today, or at some point this week. Why in the world Aston Villa ever fucking hired that dipshit is beyond me.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You also anti-Chelsea?&nbsp; They bought the league.&nbsp; Anti-Blackburn?&nbsp; They bought the league.&nbsp; You mention Villa, dont know if they are your team, but a few years back when they went close to champs league qualification it was because of Lerner putting in a right few quid.&nbsp; Most teams try and buy success in this day and age unfortunately.<br /><br />My gripe with City would be the way they let Tevez come back, they are probably the only club in the world who could have afforded to let him rot in the reserves and if he played for team and done what he did I would never accept him playing again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am also anti-Chelsea, and I am an Aston Villa fan for the EPL, though my true team is Bayern. Lerner spent some money on a few players sure, but that&#039;s the way of the game, to me there is a difference between investing in a handful of players to reshape your team, add depth, etc than it is to go the route of Chelsea, or more so Man City, and purchase a completely new side. Aston Villa also, formerly successfully in doing so, had several top quality English talent coming through it&#039;s ranks. Aston Villa is a selling team though, and when they do purchase they purchase poorly (Reo-Coker). This might be the first season in a while that Villa&#039;s top performer won&#039;t be moving to Manchester, after Barry, Milner and Young.<br /><br />It&#039;s not just transfer fees though, Manchester Utd VASTLY overspends on mediocre talent, Man City had to have offered some mind boggling wages to some of these players to get them from under the noses of clubs who were already competing in the CL.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If Lerner had kept putting in money Villa wouldnt have became a selling club.<br /><br />Totally agree with your point about Manchester United.&nbsp; When I hear their supporters grumbling about Chelsea or City spending I always laugh and point out players like Veron (26m), ferdinand (30m), berbatov (30m) and Rooney (30m).<br /><br />With bayern being your team is there any truth in the whole Ribery/ Robben rumour - fighting at training ground?

				Yea, apparently Ribery punched Robben in the dressing room at the half vs Real Madrid, arguing over taking free kicks. Ribery was fined $66k, but Robben signed a contract extension so apparently he&#039;s an adult. I could only imagine if Aguero and Tevez got into a fight in the dressing room, it&#039;d be months of back and back interviews until Tevez runs home to Argentina to pout and cry.

				Cheers mate, couldn&#039;t believe it at first, but I&#039;m not surprised seeing they both have the biggest egos imaginable. <br /><br />

				Well even as a fan of Bayern, I was joking with my friend saying the fight probably went down with Ribery hitting his fist against a locker, Robben dropping to the ground holding his face pretending he&#039;s been punched, then Ribery sprawling out grabbing his knee acting like Robben kicked him.
