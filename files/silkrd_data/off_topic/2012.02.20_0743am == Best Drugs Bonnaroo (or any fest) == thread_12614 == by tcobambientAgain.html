				So I&#039;m thinking about going to Bonnaroo this year and wondering what the best drugs to bring along that will give me a nice high but won&#039;t make me out of it.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking probably some RC&#039;s that will last a few hours that will get me somewhat fucked up but functional.&nbsp; Thoughts anyone?&nbsp; Oh, and with the ticket price, food, water, gas/driving and all that keep in mind, drugs that aren&#039;t going to cost a whole lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Think &quot;stay high at Bonnaroo on a budget&quot;.&nbsp;

				Just checked Erowid and that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m looking for I think.&nbsp; The only RC I&#039;ve done so far is MXE, which I love but I don&#039;t think would work out well walking around a music fest.&nbsp; I have some 2C-E that I ordered and should be here in a couple days.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion!

				Ill be at &#039;Roo again this year. I plan on bringing my usual Mollie, LSD and funky nuggets. I don&#039;t have any experiences with RC&#039;s tho. So j can&#039;t offer any advice in that&#039;s department. I know Mollie makes me LURVE the music, and everyone around me. Plus if I need to have sex, no problem ::D<br /><br />Its really what you&#039;re into tho, I guess. <br /><br />Best of luck, see you there :P

				Consensus seems to be weed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I go to Bonnaroo every year, on account of it being a short road trip from where I live.&nbsp; I&#039;ve gone for 5 years running now and love it.&nbsp; It has grown a TON over the 5 years that I have been going.&nbsp; Every year since my second year, I take Mollie and Weed.&nbsp; Now that I have access to SR, I might have to take more acid than I usually do.&nbsp; I find that the mollie with the acid is a fantastic combination.&nbsp; <br /><br />Weed needs no explanation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Best drug ever.&nbsp; Plus, if you have enough of it, it&#039;s a great conversation starter ;)<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never gone, then go, it&#039;s a really good time.&nbsp; Warning:&nbsp; you will most likely be dirty as hell by the end of the weekend...a lot of other people will be as well!&nbsp; haha

				Bonnaroo is to commercial.&nbsp; You should go to Wakarusa in Arkansas, Electric Forest in michicgan, Wanee, Purple hatters ball, blackwater and bear creek are all in florida at the same venue and they are a million times better than bonnaroo.

				Go to Electric Forest Fest.

				Mushrooms( or LSD either way cant go wrong), weed, maybe some DMT as it&#039;s very short acting. Had a lot of fun with DMT at psychedelic music campouts. I usually get pretty drunk, but I understand if you&#039;re looking for things that won&#039;t knock you out in the end.

				Yeah, money starts flying out as soon as people see the first balloon... I keep my shit in the trunk until nightfall and just let people spread the word, hasn&#039;t failed me yet.&nbsp; I hate to see security taking all those tanks every year, but in retrospect the fuckers usually deserve it when they&#039;re being hot with the shit filling balloons in the open and shit.<br /><br />Although there is this one festi, the first I ever went to actually, where they literally don&#039;t give a fuck what happens down there.&nbsp; There is some security there, no cops, and we were smoking blunts with them by the end of the weekend.&nbsp; Cool as fuck down there, that&#039;s the only festi&#039;s I like are the super chilled ones without the cops.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t been to a super festi yet like burning man though.

I mean you can walk around with a bong and the cop isn&#039;t gonna do a damn thing but look at you. <br />and yes burning man. on the list before I die. <br /><br />and which festival are you talking about? im always down for roadtrips to new festivals
