				Today I was fortunate enough to encounter half of a blue OC 30 mg pill free of charge. Previously my only experience with opiates consists of vicodin 7.5 mg pills. These I enjoyed very much. Hoping to get the most out of my OC, I chopped it up and snorted. Within 15 minutes I believe I was experiencing the peak of the trip. It was pure bliss, absolute enjoyment, and I had not a care in the world. As I am only 30 minutes into my experience now, I must say this feeling is so good that I couldn&#039;t help but post my happy feelings with you all. It is clear to me that opiates are a dangerous addiction but only because they kick ass (except for the inescapable opiate itch). If someone asked me what opiates are like, I would probably say, &quot;they feel like all your troubles become dust in the wind and euphoria overtakes your body.&quot; <br /><br />Sorry for this pointless rant but I just wanted to share my new experience with my friends on the road! Too bad I just discovered a new love for an addiction that I cant afford ;)

				Oxycodone is the shiznit. I miss the days where a half would get me feeling that good......<br /><br />Now i put 2 30s up each nostril with 50mg of hydroxyzine to get where i wanna be. Tolerance is a beeatch! <br /><br />Hydroxyzine is a great potentiator for any opiate, and also really helps to get rid of that itch you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Nice dust in the wind reference btw&nbsp; ;)
