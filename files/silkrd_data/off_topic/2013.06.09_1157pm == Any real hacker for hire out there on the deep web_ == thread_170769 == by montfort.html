				I&#039;ve just had my first bad experience ordering from Hackingtosh (supposely brand new iphones 5 at half the retail price) and i was scammed after sending 425 USD worth of bitcoins.<br /><br />Now my trust in websites on the deepweb is shaken. <br />the only link for a hacker on the hidden wiki (hacker4rent) doesn&#039;t offer escrow and i suspect another scam.<br /><br />anyone had success hiring a legit hacker?

				I think there may be 1 or 2 good programmer&#039;s with accounts on BlackMarketReloaded, you could message them with what kind of hacking your looking to do and see if they will give you a quote, sorry I cannot remember usernames but they can easily be found<br />

				Well I just know from general experience that the good hackers have extensive knowledge, like 10&#039;s of years in programming and knows how to write/compile their own code, also the same amount of experience in network security and security programs. Sounds like the kind of hackers and &quot;programmers&quot; you are describing are script kiddies lol. Dont get me wrong I know a little bit about a few programming languages, but am not really much of hacker. I just know one dude on BMR who sells alot of hacking stuff, and hacked stuff and his own programs for various purposes who just so happens to have 30+ years experience in the programming field and I would assume he is a damn good hacker, depending on what he would be motivated to &quot;hack&quot;.

				Yes I can code HTML5, I am not a hacker though... And there are WAYYY more applications of hacking then that. You dont even have to be connected to an internet to be performing a hack, lol lookup the word in a dictionary somewhere, the damn dudes who invented the internet were &quot;true hackers&quot;

				Yep all good hackers learn the ins and outs of everything they like to fuck around with. Thats how people develop their own unique patterns and such, You can actually take a classroom full of 30 kids learning programming and tell them to make a certain programm with certain guidlines and you can pick out their code like unique fingerprints, everybody learns shit differently, Thats one reason I really am interested in computer/networking technology, I wouldnt mind learning a few more cool hacking techniques. Lol I remember trying to learn SQL Injection before and that shit was pretty crazy haha
