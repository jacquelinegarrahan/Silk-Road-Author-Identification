				In short - no. Any hand-presser will make incredibly crappy pills that aren&#039;t very durable at all.

				You can, but it kinda involves welding a steel frame and investing in a heavy car lifter, designed for trucks.<br />It is much easier to make capsules.

				I do exactly as rake suggests.<br />I measure out dosages and but inside of gelatin or vegetable capsules.

				all the pill presses i saw did cost 20.000++ EUR, i guess its better to buy some capsules with vitamines, or buy empty capsules.<br /><br />anyway it would be AWESOME if you could make pills with your own custom logos :D i would love that!<br />anyone knows how these logos are made? i mean you need some kind of steel plate that can stand multible tons of pressure from these pill presses.

				Yeah the pills do look sturdy! A few friends have tried some pills made from that press, they didnt say anything about the pills being bad quality..<br />I think they do a custom dies, but for the machines, they have metal dies and i think the handpress has a plastic die, so you can always custom engrave ;)

				Do you guys prefer pressies or gel caps? In both the context of buying them, and making them?<br /><br />Wondering,<br />DigitalAlch

				Pills are a lot easier to keep safe, they don&#039;t break nearly as easy as caps do, and if you have an actual presser like a TDP-5 making them is also much easier than capping out doses individually.

				i don&#039;t care at all for personal use, but pills are definitely better for selling since people seem to attach more legitimacy to them (maybe just used to seeing them in that form?)
