				As the Subject reads, how old are you? I can&#039;t help but get the impression that the young far outnumber the elderly on this forum. ;) If I had to guess though, I&#039;d say the average age of our members is between either 19-24 or 35-44. Who knows though, I may be in for a surprise.

				i&#039;m not gonna get old. well, that much older anyway. my body has been properly abused (physically, mentally and chemically) for the last 12 - 14 years so i can&#039;t see myself getting much past 50 cos i&#039;m not slowing down. in fact, since SR i&#039;m probably speeding up. not doing more drugs, just a wider variety

I actually care more about the poll answers to be honest though, which I hope is vague enough to stay anonymous. ;) I completely understand the worry though.<br /><br /><br />If people feel like sharing, that&#039;s up to them. But if you do decide to share, it would be better to answer what age &#039;range&#039; you&#039;re in. Such as saying, &quot;I may be in my fifties, but at least I still have Viagra!&quot;

				From 1987 :). 1983-1996 the years my cousin claimes that in that time there was really good quality heroine, on the streets!!!! Then time when the heroine dealer hand cocaine like also this time...but you could then even order by some real raw opium and get much easier on China white h!!!<br />I was born to late&nbsp; :(. He is complaining many times that know its more and more cut once you can buy it. 4 years ago he went to Asia and had the occasion to smoke raw opium in a village in the middle off the jungle and at the places were the discotheques and bars were he could easely score the good old China white for a very very soft price. Ow yeah about that in the jungle were he smoked raw opium with the tribe/village there, there where at least every 3 hours 30 tourists there taking pictures but only 12% or so would try and smoke, all different people off all different country&#039;s sitting there and some off them even never did drugs or meds like Oxy&#039;s and stuff but they just wanna take the 1 in a lifetime chance and they hit the opium pipe&nbsp; ;D ;D while others taking pictures and filming it. Tip from my cousin iff you wanna visit the jungle in the golden triangle or other places India....Cash with low value for us Europeans and from the USA open many doors but it is a lot off cash for them. He told me an American was sitting next to him and he had calculated 4 or 5 big hits from the opium pipe for 1 dollar&nbsp; :). But you can not bring opium or china white back to home by plane, the airport were he departed was full off a sort off police/customs and more then 3 drug dogs per 2 rows off passengers. He took 5 polaroid photo&#039;s off the village were they went to smoke :D. Anyway going off topic, so have a nice day!!!<br />Greetttzz
