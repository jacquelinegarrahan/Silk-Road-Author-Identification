				Meetups with strangers usually ends bad.. .&nbsp; Unless you know their home address.&nbsp; . .or something. . <br /><br />any meetup from here would likely end in robbery, extortion or worse.&nbsp; I mean, people are great here, but .. <br /><br />I read a post about a vendor who met up with another vendor in the same city to trade cash and product.&nbsp; He got robbed for both.&nbsp; One vendor knocked out another vendor for competition sake....&nbsp; (It was two Canadian vendors.. I won&#039;t say here. .) They had done many previous transactions this way.&nbsp; Just this last deal was the one he chose to rob and end the relationship .&nbsp; Sad.&nbsp; &nbsp;They were still anonymous and thats where it went wrong.&nbsp; &nbsp;They shouldve went to each others house or something. .a little more cozy.&nbsp; All the guy has to work with is a cel phone number for a burner phone. . useless.&nbsp; &nbsp;The temptation to rob is too great sometimes. . . greedy bastards.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Its sad, also that guns are involved in a lot of face to face deals.&nbsp; Sometimes, people snap or are high and really paranoid.&nbsp; I had a few deals end sour because the dealer was waaaay too sketched out. .&nbsp; peeking out the windows and shit . . <br /><br />I guess that&#039;s why this site exists.&nbsp; To make is safe to do this kind of business.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-)<br /><br />I know I can&#039;t risk being shot, robbed or get in a fight.. . or arrested ..<br /><br />B careful,&nbsp; use escrow and play safe.<br />

				Jeez, that&#039;s a bummer. Sounds like nobody should ever meet. <br /><br /><br />Yeah, well, that&#039;s why I&#039;m here. I know where I can go to score (to an extent) but I&#039;d rather be safe and not asking sketchy randos if they know where I can get a bun or whatever. The future is now. Maybe the next step is downloading and printing drugs? hahah

				I&#039;m friends with many one-time SR users.<br /><br />They were all selectively scammed and will never touch BTC or the road again. In fact, I&#039;m certain that I was selectively scammed during my first purchase on the road too. Only because I was much, much older than my friends&#039; accounts and slightly well known on our forums, did the vendor completely refund me.<br /><br />PM me for his username.<br /><br />Its been more than a month since it should have arrived, and I never received a love letter or any indication that it was seized. It was simply never shipped, because its more profitable to steal newbies&#039; money and do their drugs, than actually provide a service.
