				Yeah, I&#039;ve had a fuckin rough weekend and I&#039;ve got a million and one other things to do than deal with this whore. If anyone can DOx this person as well that&#039;d be even better. I wouldn&#039;t even suggest this shit normally but he isn&#039;t one of us, he&#039;s just some two-bit whore who needs his life destroying, specifically because he&#039;s pissin me the fuck off.

				No Lim, no DDOS for u. I have better things to make bots do, like make me money xD.<br /><br />Anyway DDOS is a waste of time, could easily switch IPs and its back up, and blacklist all of the bots as well, I doubt a big site like them doesn&#039;t have DDOS protection lol. Also no one download supposed DDOS&#039;ers, no such thing (they&#039;re DOS, which is only your computer, and most are binded/backdoored just like LOIC which people STILL download for some retarded reason). The only clean DDOS you can preform really is with a botnet, which is a bitch to get in the first place if you don&#039;t wana pay out the ass for it. Plus, stealing bots is pretty easy (use the update command to download YOUR bot and it&#039;ll overwrite itself, poof, they loose their bots lol).
