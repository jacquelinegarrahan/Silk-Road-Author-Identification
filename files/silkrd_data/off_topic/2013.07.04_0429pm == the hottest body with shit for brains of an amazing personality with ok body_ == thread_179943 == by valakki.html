				If you just want to have sex and not a real commitment then can&#039;t you be having sex with both of them? ???<br /><br />Or do you plan to lead one of them on with a relationship that you are not really interested in having prosper into something more serious?

				Yeah, If its just to fuck, Choose the second one, Submissive one shel let you do whatever you want. But if you want a relationship go with the one who doesnt have shit for brains.Actually the second one is better in every aspect, smarter, submissive and good personality.

				and to stay on topic - are they both your bosses in the same place of work, or do they know each other in any way?<br /><br />if no - fuck them both. if yes, but you&#039;re only out for a shag, go for the fittest one. if you actually see something more than a shag, go with the one you can talk to - there&#039;s nothing more irritating than a thick as fuck bird after a shag
