				Dear QotSA-fans! <br /><br />My fiancée got us two tickets as a Valentine&#039;s day present,<br />even when we will have to wait a little bit longer to enjoy it,<br />there will be a new album from QotSA with Nick back in the<br />team, with Dave Grohl on drums and Mark Lanegan backing<br />up/interchanging with Josh Homme, so the Songs for the Deaf<br />line-up, plus a feature with NIN&#039;s TRENT REZNOR!<br /><br />This not only made my day, it made my year and<br />I hope I&#039;ll get a grip of Nick&#039;s ankle again when he&#039;s <br />playing on that fence open-air at the same location I <br />saw them back in 2003. <br /><br />My 10 year long QotSA-gig abstinence has paid in full.<br /><br />I&#039;m so happy at the moment, I could shed some tears!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />But I won&#039;t be able to do that probably, as my Volcano&#039;s <br />bag is filled to the brink with Kerala Kush to celebrate it!&nbsp; ;D

				ah man i&#039;m so relieved to see someone who appreciates real music with strings and drums not just overproduced electronic shite. not a big fan of qotsa but i saw them live waaay back in ldn hyde park supporting foo fighters and they were pretty sick. i fell asleep during motorhead. all that irrelevant crap aside, have a sick time! tell that ginger ninja to keep his hands off brody dalle&nbsp; :P

				Thanks, I&#039;m also glad some people around here still enjoy real live music!&nbsp; ;D<br />I don&#039;t have anything against Electronic music or Hip-Hop, I love both,<br />but I also love Rock n‘ Roll and that&#039;s where I came from, so I&#039;ll stay true <br />to my roots till I finally return into the information potential and love the<br />human element that still remains at the heart of every musical production.

				yeah it&#039;s good to have a pretty broad taste, i just don&#039;t get how people can listen to crap like dubstep all day sober! i grew up on a diet of punk rock, ska and pop punk and still love the same stuff 10 years later. a lot of my friends who were metalheads put their guitars down, bought decks and vinyl and decided to be unsuccessful djs or crappy middle class white boy rappers. kinda sad to watch. don&#039;t get me wrong, i love a bit of basement jaxx or pendulum with the right drugs. good music is good music!

				Aw that&#039;s the shit.. Saw QotSA when they did their self album re-release tour last year and it was the shit. <br /><br />You Can&#039;t Quit Me Baby - Live is so epic, Josh did a great job. <br /><br />Been listening to that new Lanegan Band album &quot;Blues Funeral&quot; of late - every single song on it is gold. Definitely recommend a couple spins of the album.
