				I have only taken (what I believed to have been) LSD once.&nbsp; This &quot;friend&quot; of ours asked if we wanted to take LSD that night, and he bought four hits and gave us each one for free.&nbsp; I put it on my tongue and let it sit for about two minutes, and then swallowed it.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t feel like I really tripped on acid, though.&nbsp; I just felt pretty euphoric and giggly and had an appreciation of everything around me in the city.&nbsp; After I smoked weed, however, I got super weird and made this fucked up video of myself rambling for half an hour.&nbsp; Do you normally trip off of one hit, and if so, was it possibly just bunk or a piece of paper, or was my ROA ineffective?&nbsp; Should I have taken it sublingually?&nbsp; I&#039;d like to actually trip on acid someday, so I&#039;m just curious.

				I&#039;m not an expert, but I think you need at least 2 hits to be really in the &quot;tripping balls&quot; zone.<br /><br />There have been times when I only took 1 hit and just felt a bit wired, strange and uncomfortable for the whole night. I didn&#039;t really enjoy it.<br /><br />I need at least 2 hits to experience the serious euphoria, open-eye visuals, and deeply philosophical head space.<br /><br />Obviously it can depend on how much each hit is dosed at, whether the acid has degraded, the user&#039;s frame/build, whether you&#039;ve eaten much prior to dropping, set and setting, etc.<br /><br />It sounds like what you had probably was acid, perhaps just a mild/weak dose. The giveaway is usually the onset and duration. LSD generally take 15 mins to an hour to kick in, and lasts for a solid 8-10 hours.

				Take two or three hits, and let them sit on your tongue for at least five minutes before chewing and swallowing. That&#039;ll get you where you&#039;re going. :)
