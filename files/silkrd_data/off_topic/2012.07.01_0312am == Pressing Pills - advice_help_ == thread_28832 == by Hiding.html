				Hey guys and ladies,<br /><br />I am currently trying to press tablets on a small scale. Nothing fancy and not using fancy equipment but I&#039;m also not having much luck so I&#039;m looking for advice from anyone who has done it, low end or not. Any advice will be considered and all will be appreciated. This is not an mdma/mda/Ecstasy press. It&#039;s just another RC I want to press into tablets for my friend&#039;s bday. We talked about how one day the 2c fun would come to an end and after reading the DEA&#039;s pending schedule for 2c&#039;s, I wanted to have this done for him before his bday but around there would be ok too.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve tried:<br />Purchased a cheap but surprisingly decent &quot;pollen press&quot;. The diameter is too large for my liking but I can maybe figure out a taper method on my own. Any suggestions are welcome here also.<br />I&#039;m using MicroCrystalline Cellulose as a binding agent. I&#039;m using magnesium stearate as the releasing agent. I have tried some fd&amp;c powder food dye and also without it.<br /><br />Ratios = MCC:MS:Color<br />2:0.4:2<br />2:0.4:1<br />2:0.4:0<br />2:0.5:0.5<br />4:0.7:0.5<br /><br />It does press together but it breaks pretty easy. Even touching it will rub off some of the powder onto my hands and a simple poke would crack it into 4-7 pieces. I know part of this is because the thickness is not too large. I have tried 1/8th thickness and maybe 1/4 or 1/3 as the thickest but they all (pretty much) break in the same way with a poke.<br /><br />Am I missing something, is it just the press, combination of things?<br /><br />Sorry if this is the wrong section for this question, I didn&#039;t really know where to put it.<br /><br />Thanks for any help

				I&#039;m mostly just following this thread because I&#039;m planning to do the same with some 4-aco-dmt soon as I get it.<br /><br />But from googling MicroCrystalline Cellulose for a quick/lazy research, my only suggestion is that... maybe you&#039;re not using enough pressure?<br /><br />If tapping a hammer on your press to try and make it bind harder is an option, go ahead. But again, I only did lazy research and I have no practical experience in this subject.

I will also be making some 4-aco tabs. I have some dpt and 2c-i around as well.<br /><br />It&#039;s possible I&#039;m not using enough pressure, I am using a hand held press so a hammer is not really an option or I&#039;ll destroy the threads.

				You should probably just use cellulose/gelatine capsules or get a proper press.

				I have been using capsules and it has always worked fine.<br /><br />This is just something I wanted to do for a good friend after we talked about it a while back. As much as I like doing cool things, I&#039;m not likely to invest 100s into pressing a few pills. Do you have any personal suggestion on a real press? <br /><br />I have about $60 invested into all the supplies as it sits, which I can throw away if no solutions come up and not feel bad about. But, I&#039;d rather figure it out while I have the binder and chemicals.
