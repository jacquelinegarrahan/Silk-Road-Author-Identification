			<dd class="postbody">
				Hello esteemed people of SR. I&#039;m curious to get some feedback on the following:<br />For some 35-years now, I&#039;ve been experimenting with substances to increase my level of &#039;happiness&#039; and ability to enjoy life in the moment. I&#039;m a fucking worry-wart by nature and especially in winter tend to get depressed.<br /><br />While I&#039;ve only began sampling some of the designer &#039;drugs&#039; since becoming a member of SR, I have over the years done all of the traditional, legal and illegal self-meds: alcohol, marijuana, hash, LSD, mushrooms, prescription opiates, heroin, cocaine.<br /><br />Recently I&#039;ve been dabbling in MDMA and finding that I LOVE the loving but have a hard time recovering afterwards: I tend to go really down-in-the-dumps after the comedown. The above-mentioned drugs, each for their own reasons, aren&#039;t much of a long-term help with keeping away the blues. <br />I&#039;ve also been on a number of different anti-depressants and sertraline currently keeps me &#039;o.k.&#039; but not much more. In terms of healthy living, although I&#039;m not consistent, I do exercise regularly and watch what I eat but unless I take &#039;something&#039; I&#039;m usually pretty fuckin&#039; melancholic.<br /><br />***Looking for any experiences out here in the SR world: how do you keep your &#039;mood&#039; up consistently?

				Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever suffered from depression in much of the traditional sense, but I have some people close to me in my life that have struggled with it a bit throughout their lives.<br /><br />I&#039;d be pretty hesitant to look at MDMA as a sustainable solution, fantastic though it may be in an &#039;every now and then&#039; sense. Strictly in terms of the &#039;suicide Tuesdays&#039;, I find that a few 5-HTPS after a night out help a lot with the come-down, but then again they&#039;ve never really been too severe for me. I try and exercise at least 3-4 times a week, which combined with some weed always does the job for me, but like I said I&#039;ve never really had a chronic issue.<br /><br />I&#039;m interested, though, what have experiences with LSD been like?

				Surrounding yourself with happy, good people. For real. I wish I knew this when I was younger, but when you surround yourself with angry cynical people you get angry and cynical too.<br /><br />Sunlight seems to help. Bask in it. Soak it in. Stock up on it all summer.<br /><br />Exercise seems to work too, when vigorous and consistent. I find it&#039;s especially good for anxiety.<br /><br />But none of the drugs I ever tried, pharmaceutical or otherwise ever produced a lasting elevation in mood. YMMV.

				^Word. Don&#039;t know how much of an extrovert you are, but simply the experience of being with positive friends is arguably the best solution.

				MDA is your answer. There is no recovery, you feel great the next day, and next week, and you feel a lingering change in your soul (for the better) for weeks and sometimes months. Check it out.

However you can speed up the replenishment of Serotin in your brain by eating food like Bananas, dates, figs and as many said exercise!

I have never had more of a hangover even from when I used to drink, MDA has the highest high of the MDXX compounds as well as the lowest low, to me at least.

				I feel that drugs just keep setting new &quot;low&quot; bars for you.&nbsp; I get depressed every now and then when I think about life in general and the obscurity of death, but I find it best to just find something new to motivate you.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do the same shit over and over every day m8,&nbsp; go experience new things that excite you.&nbsp; It may be a shitty response if you were looking for a drug, but the effects of drugs don&#039;t last long.

				eddiethegun, john9891, schuldig, billiken, croskin, cyberscour, This Is Serious Mom...............<br />thank-you all for your sage, informative feedback. <br /><br />I guess I know from experience the importance of taking care of oneself and trying to be surrounded by those you love. I&#039;m fortunate to have a smallish but very loving family.<br /><br />I&#039;ve acquired some 5-HTPs for the mornings after and the sertraline anti-depressant seems to be one of the<br />ones that actually help with MDMA comedowns.<br />&nbsp;<br />Actually, just reading these responses so far has reminded me once again that SR and the forum is as much about community as it is about anything else.<br /><br />For john 9891: my dance with LSD was mostly in the late 70s, early 80s and if you&#039;ve never tried it, I suggest that it offers the most profound experience you can have by ingesting a foreign substance in your body...at least it was for me.&nbsp; Be forewarned, however, a quality dose will allow you to look so deep into your own subconscious AND conversely look at external issues in your life from many different viewpoints not just the one we mere mortals usually use. To some this might sound exciting; to others, frightening.<br />I&#039;d certainly entertain doing it again sometimes but if you&#039;re busy with raising a family, you&#039;d have to find an escape for a day or two. There&#039;s no such thing as being stoned on acid discretely. ;)<br />Peace, friends; happy to read any other ideas people have.<br /><br />
