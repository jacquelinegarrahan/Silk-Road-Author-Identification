				Marijuana is seriously awesome.&nbsp; It has different smells, looks, textures, tastes, effects.&nbsp; From energetic, narcotic, euphoric, psychedelic, and mixed highs.&nbsp; What more can you ask for from a plant?&nbsp; Not to mention it&#039;s health benefits for people who are sick and even though the smoke being carcinogenic, it doesn&#039;t cause cancer.&nbsp; <br /><br />It goes good with everything and anything.&nbsp; Even smoking it with shrooms, acid, or even coke is amazing. It goes well with almost any drug to be honest(except alcohol for me I get vertigo). Smoking for any type of pain, nausea, or no appetite.&nbsp; For anxiety and depression as well as creativity and opening up your mind.&nbsp; The point is, it is such a safe drug compared to most anything else and I feel it really is good for you as long as you don&#039;t smoke ounces a day lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not to mention it is seriously awesome for harsh come downs of any drugs and especially hang overs.&nbsp; Bud doesn&#039;t give you a horrible widthdrawls like other drugs do.&nbsp; When you don&#039;t have any bud for the day or a while it sucks but you live.&nbsp; I think that is one of the best things about bud.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing like smoking and chilling either with your friends, loved ones, or dogs/pets in your comfy house watching tv, movie, listening to music, playing games or what ever.&nbsp; It makes the moment so much more memorable and fun.&nbsp; It&#039;s awesome.<br /><br />I seriously don&#039;t know what I would have done with out bud in my high school years.&nbsp; I had a very tough child hood and high school was a nightmare.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying what I did was right but in my situation I had absolutely no other escape or medicine to help me through those tough times.&nbsp; Depression, anxiety, huge family problems, friend problems, and puberty. I was just a total mess.&nbsp; I know self medicating isn&#039;t the best idea but if it wasn&#039;t for bud to take a huge load off me every night and day I don&#039;t think I would&#039;ve made it.&nbsp; At least not as easily.<br /><br />I have great respect for this plant and I seriously hope it becomes legal in the US this year.&nbsp; I&#039;m praying.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I have no bud right now and am feeling really good on DXM lol so thought I&#039;d share.&nbsp; &nbsp;I honestly didn&#039;t think I would ever try DXM but it&#039;s pretty crazy.&nbsp; The light doses mimic ecstasy but with a lot more &quot;drunk&quot; to it and not nearly as much euphoria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Always wanted to see if others felt the same way about bud for a while now and finally got to writing this.<br /><br />Let me know!

				Now this is a first reply to a post to be proud of&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I can relate so much to the HS part. Dude you really do have to appreciate bud...<br /><br />Because after all those long ass days or the nights you spent alone up all night, you always had Mary J!<br /><br />If I didn&#039;t have a blunt in my system before nearly every class I was fucked!<br /><br />Teachers knew I was high, but marijuana makes me think deeper, so instead of calling me out, they would call on me to answer the questions others couldn&#039;t.<br /><br />Everyone cracked on me in HS for being stoned but boy right when college flew in guess who calls you up trying to buy a G! The same fuckers that called you out! a few examples..<br /><br />QB recieved a full scholarship, called me out daily,..... tries to buy buds from me now ;D<br /><br />Literally THE hottest bitch in my area during HS, didn&#039;t say a word to me in HS...... Ask me to get her high for the 1st time then proceeds to fuck me.<br /><br />Geeky kids that would criticize it saying its harmful...... Now accept it because of media &amp; legalization.<br />Haha fuck them, they shouldn&#039;t be allowed to partake!<br /><br />Just want to take a fucking second to remind all those cunts, told you so! ;D

				Haha very true.&nbsp; It&#039;s funny how that works, 90% of the goody goody kids in HS turn out to be worse than the kids who were &quot;bad&quot; in high school.<br /><br />But yes, I don&#039;t know what I would&#039;ve done with out bud on those lonely nights and I have insomnia, still do...=(<br /><br /><br />By the way, props on banging the hot girl!&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t that lucky lol.
