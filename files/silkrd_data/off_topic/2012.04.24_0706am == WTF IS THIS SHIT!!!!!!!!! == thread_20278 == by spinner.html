By the way! And the gentleman before. I thought I was going to get hammered for that opinion.<br /><br />Though I think it is 100% true. I understand it could make for some conversation. But in the very little time I have been here I can&#039;t believe the&nbsp; paranoia about LE or the road being shut down,<br /><br />Every new poster is LE. Every new vendor is Le. Every weird address is LE. <br /><br />I just want to set the record straight. I welcome the LE. Read away..Hell order some product! Support the road! I will vendor to them... And I am dead serious. They are as anonymous&nbsp; to me as any other customer I have. <br /><br />If you follow the guidelines the road has set out for everyone. And you follow the guidelines you should have in your own head then there will be no problems. Sure things will happen. But no major sting is underway. Just use your brain. If you want to go the extra mile... then by all means you do it. Do whatever YOU feel you need to do, so you feel comfortable.<br /><br />But you will find in the end you will waste a lot of energy trying to be sly. You will see that ordering a few goodies from solid vendors, not trading product off the road, not using $$$, I guess just basically breaking every fucking rule that has been laid out for us by the people before us then you will find this road is a beautiful highway! <br /><br />You can find amazing things here from vendors like this:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fa89fcfcd2<br /><br />Look at his items! And check out the armory .. same guy he sells a bullet proof land rover(most exsoensive item on the road)<br /><br />To this guy who sells links to invites for extreme wrestling forums( you need a fucking invite LMAO)<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/80ed936bcd<br /><br /><br /><br />And everything in-between. The road is an awesome place that you can get lost in with all the great items. So instead of thinking about something that we have no control over(i.e if they are here then they are here ..read above to not worry) enjoy everything that is here. And realize that we are all lucky to be a part of it. And soon this road will be a highway.<br /><br />This place is not going away. And you wont get in any trouble. So buckle up people and enjoy your ride!<br /><br />Don&#039;t miss out because your looking in the rear view mirror for LE that is not looking for you!<br /><br />&quot;RxKing: Loves the road...still is cautious.. but never worries... has a better life because of it&quot;<br /><br /><br />RxKing<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have ZERO to do with those links. I was just pointing out two extremely different things on here. Not making fun of either vendors in any way. I love your stuff.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Are we even sure that this supposed warning is legit? After all, I highly doubt that the DEA would literally post their next plans for everyone to say. No legal organization would do that, because they wouldn&#039;t want anyone preparing to clear themselves of evidence. So I&#039;m guessing that this is a hoax somehow, although I don&#039;t know who&#039;s responsible.

I must confess. I never clicked on it LOL. I just knew what it was about based on the responses. I think all these should be deleted.<br /><br />&nbsp;Meaning the road should treat all post about LE and &quot;busts&quot; like the NFL does gambling. They know it happens, they know it is there..... Fuck they even know that is why 95% of people watch it. <br /><br />Even if it is a friendly wager with the wife for a BJ on who wins... The NFL won&#039;t let any gambling advertising exist. <br /><br />NONE<br />No lotteries<br />No Las Vegas adds<br />No nothing. <br /><br />They don&#039;t care if it is for something that is not even about gambling. Like a poker tournament for a charity somewhere. They ban there players from playing. And this is the off season!<br /><br />My point is everyone here knows we are breaking the law. Yet everyday there are&nbsp; 100&#039;s of post about <br />LE or another website shutting down or just some random BS about the law. <br /><br />Better example for this community would be a head shop. When your in there... you can&#039;t talk about weed. Though every singe product is for that. They just won&#039;t let you talk about it. It works.<br /><br />So SR should highly encourage(delete) all post about LE. <br /><br />Now I am not talking about post that help with avoiding them. I am just talking about all the paranoia around it. And no new vendor should be subject to all the BS that happens. Charge more for the accounts. Hold all funds till people get there drugs. Establish a list of approved SR buyers. Make new vendors send to them. Hold funds till the TRUSTED BUYERS get and verify there pills/weed/coke/whatever. <br /><br />Then watch them. Make them report to SR what quantities they are going to be selling.Don&#039;t want the reverse scam where buyers trust a guy and then boom he fucks everyone. Let the BIG boys Pay a higher membership rate...&nbsp; ect ect ect. I should stop ... wrong place to post this!&nbsp; But you get my point..<br /><br />QUIT FUCKING WORRYING :) Buy.... receive....enjoy....post away! Just don&#039;t post about the strange car following you from your post office box with the fake company name. No one is following you.<br /><br />RxKing: loves how the road is...but it could be a lot better! Lets pick up the litter and drive the &quot;bad drivers&quot; off the road and wreck there cars and kill them! Make them get a new car(screen name) and get back on the road!<br />Ban these loser posters like perky already. I already killed him anyways&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />RxKing...never a short post. sorry
