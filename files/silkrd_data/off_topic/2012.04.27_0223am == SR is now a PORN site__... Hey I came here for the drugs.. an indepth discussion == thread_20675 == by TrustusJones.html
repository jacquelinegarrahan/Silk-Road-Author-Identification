				So this got started over in &#039;OFF TOPIC&#039; but I think it deserves a spot in regular discussion as it affects everyone who comes to this site.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t want to start off coming across like a little bitch who hates anything other than drugs...&nbsp; &quot;i don&#039;t like guns!&quot;... I don&#039;t like porn!!&quot;...&nbsp; whaaa... whatever... I LOVE guns and porn... so there.<br /><br />With that said, I DID NOT join SR the Porn Site... I joined SR the DRUG SITE.<br /><br />Over the last few days the pictures on the main page have been filling up with porn. Again... I LOVE porn... but it is somewhat annoying since I don&#039;t believe this was the original intention of the site.<br /><br />I am not pushing to remove the porn... all I am asking is &#039;before&#039; another 10,000 porn ads are created SR staff make it so only one or two porn ads max show up on the main page... <br /><br />If I log in next week and all six pics are of porn and not one picture of some real pretty dank kush... well I just think that would really suck...<br /><br />Thanks!<br />TJ

				I think they may be tweaking the coding to be fair because some people finalize buttons weren&#039;t working earlier.

				Yeah just logged back in and hit with three... one gangbang, one fat chick and one chick plunging a dildo in her ass... good times<br /><br />here is also why I am not in favor of porn pics on the front page... there are 100,000+ porn sites in an industry pulling in over 5 billion in revenue a year...&nbsp; does SR really need to aid the porn industry? plus 90% of all the ads are for less than a dollar... it&#039;s not like SR is making a million dollars off them...&nbsp; simple fix... get em off the front page.<br /><br />TJ

				It is pretty annoying, I remember when I first joined I would love seeing pictures of cocaine, it looked like candy you can just eat! And now it&#039;s just porn pics, the other day it was &quot;how to get a 3some&quot; with some douche banging two girls...

				I just ask that they keep the photos off the front page. <br />There is a link for porn, if you want it, it&#039;s there. Porn photos on the front page ruin the SR experience IMHO.

				Who doesn&#039;t love logging into SR to be greeted by an image of a middle aged Japanese woman getting spit-roasted by two over weight Asian men?<br /><br />And you can watch the entire Japanese cougar orgy video for the low price of .30 BTC!!!!!!<br /><br />In all honesty the image of 3Janes moon rocks does more for me.<br /><br />I came for the drugs and I&#039;ll stay for the drugs.<br />
