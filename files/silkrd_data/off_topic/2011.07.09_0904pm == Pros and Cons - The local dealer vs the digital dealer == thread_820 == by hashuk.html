				Alite, <br /><br />been both, in my history (or maybe im lying),&nbsp; weighing up pros and cons, anything to add?<br /><br />To clarify, this topic is about your &#039;trusted&#039; quality local vs digital dealer, a street dealer and their crap is not to be considered.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Ease of money access - LOCAL&nbsp; ;D<br />Avoid druggies/ local dealers face to face - DIGITAL&nbsp; ::)<br />Ease of anonymity - DIGITAL if done right?! although Local is ok if your careful,&nbsp; 8)<br />Discretion - DIGITAL apart from having to mail stuff, as longs as packages are sound this shouldn&#039;t be a problem, with LOCAL with the CCTV or neighbors soon catch on to the many friends you have that stay for like 1 minutes.&nbsp; :o<br />Potential of making more money off the money; DIGITAL if we are referring to bitcoins and you believe that the waiting game will pay off and you will have a fortune one day....&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />well my brain is now a bit blank, time to smoke a bit, hoping for some interesting pros and cons :)<br /><br />peace<br /><br />hashuk<br /><br /><br />[edit, far to many spelling errors, corrected all that i see ]

				There are people like me out there that have had local dealers get busted and then you&#039;re stuck out.&nbsp; If you live very rural, there is no driving to connect.&nbsp; You can use cash, that&#039;s a plus, but then you also lose a level of anonimity when dealing local.&nbsp; Bitcoins are the worst part of buying SR, due to the hassle of shuffling money around, but I can deal with it for the level of security I believe I have with the process.&nbsp; It is very hard to find a good drug dealer here, almost all of them are scumbags, and really dumb when it comes to privacy/security in real life.<br /><br />I have had 6 transactions on SR and was pleased with everyone of them-5 out of 5 on all.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure that has ever happened to me in real life.<br /><br />BTC offer a level of liberty that we as humans have never had, SR offers the same.&nbsp; I have gotten drugs in the mail before SR, but SR is the best way, once you find sellers to trust.&nbsp; SR forever.
