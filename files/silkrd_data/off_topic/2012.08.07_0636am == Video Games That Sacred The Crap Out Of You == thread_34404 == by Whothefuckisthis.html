				What was a video game that really freaked you out?<br /><br />For me Silent Hill made me piss my pants the first time I played it! But in my opinion the scariest game I&#039;ve ever played is a little game for PlayStation called Clock Tower. Currently playing it on an emulator. ;D

				Haha yeah RE3 used to scare me whenever nemesis came around. ;D <br />Here&#039;s a trailer from the Clock Tower game. Pretty cheap now but when I think about it the game was pretty demented for it&#039;s time (satanic occultism, graphic murder and violence, high tension, etc...). ;D<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1njdpVV82g

				Original Resident Evil spooked me good.&nbsp; It was the surprise factor, lack of ammunition and generally being helpless against slow moving zombies.&nbsp; Talk about anxiety!&nbsp; My heart rate would skyrocket.&nbsp; After several marathon gaming sessions, I would dream about it - Nightmares!!!&nbsp; Crazy stuff.&nbsp; RE really was a ground breaking game.&nbsp; Created a new genre of video game.<br /><br />I had a similar psychological response to Dead Space.&nbsp; I could barely look at the TV screen!!

				Oh man, I remember Resident Evil 4 scaring the CRAP out of me in the first level. I didn&#039;t really know what to expect from the game, but there was much screaming in my house that day. Also the game DOOM, when I first played it as a 6 year old, gave me nightmares. I do not claim to be a brave girl. Better then my sister though, who despite being older then me was very scared of Metroid Prime.

				Yeah it is definitely a generational thing.<br />One REALLY old game that just sprang to mind, which was a bit of a rip off of Alien, was something called Project Firestart.<br />Basically you were trapped on a ship and had to figure out what the fuck happened with some kind of alien genetic research program gone wrong, evading rogue aliens in the corridors and shit.<br />IT was back in the day when floppy disks were first appearing on the C64.

				Definitely resident evil 2 for me as well.

Tron Legacy (as far as I know) is a sci-fi movie with an us vs. them 1984 style theme. Or am I wrong?<br /><br />Science Fiction is a genre of which both films are a part. Both films tell a different story and the writers of each have different goals with their respective stories. District 9 might well have been written to drive home the idea that prejudice is wrong. But, I feel the film was written to entertain and utilize CGI in a way that had it had not been effectively used before and used prejudice as a vessel to reach that end and pump out popcorn selling product for whatever weekend it was released. Tron I would guess was produced for the same reasons and used its predecessor&#039;s fan base as a means to improve its audience. <br /><br />If you are interested in films about prejudice I would recommend &quot;Crash&quot; as it is better written, directed, casted, acted, and produced. Not to mention recognized for many of those attributes.

				I have seen crash, its a great movie.<br />Although, your ideas about District 9 utilizing CGI in a way it has not been done before, i think is slightly off.<br />The use of CGI is apparent through the whole movie.&nbsp; It&#039;s all about power.&nbsp; The fact that Vickers can use alien tech while the whole of human kind cannot is the subject matter.<br />The fight scene at the end was a testament to the struggle that he went through as a character.<br /><br />As for Tron Legacy, that was a movie based ENTIRELY on CGI.&nbsp; Even using it to such extent to make Jeff Bridges look younger.<br />They also tried to do scenes that had never been done before&nbsp; e.g the light cycle battle.<br />BUT, because the whole movie was nothing but CGI, very little story and anything else, it pretty much failed on a whole.<br />

				Ah another one I forgot that had a weird spooky feeling on me: Flashback! (For Sega Megadrive-Genesis).

				LSD Dream Emulator anyone? Japanese game on ps1. <br />I haven&#039;t played it yet but seen video of it on youtube and cunts freak the fuck out while playing it! <br /><br />The story goes that the designer would have dreams and then write them down as soon as he woke up and eventually designed a game based directly on those dreams. It&#039;s hard to explain but basically you walk around and create what happens next based on what you just did. To fully understand what i mean you would have to watch the videos.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently waiting on a mate to rip the iso into a format that can be played on my psp since my attempt at running and setting up a ps1 emulator on my pc failed..
