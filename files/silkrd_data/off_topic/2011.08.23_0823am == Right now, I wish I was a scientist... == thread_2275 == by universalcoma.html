				I got drunk the other night and ended up buying 50mg of 25i-NBOMe, because &quot;OMG THAT WOULD LAST ME FOREVER!!!&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t have a microgram scale, I don&#039;t know how to lay blotter...what the hell am I supposed to do with it?

				chemist friend here. it&#039;ll dissolve in ethanol. use 100%. get a 1mL syringe (with 0.1mL graduations on the side), dissolve your stuff up in 10 mL of ethanol. the resultant solution will have a concentration of 5mg/ mL. take some rice paper and draw accurately a grid with 4cm2 squares. now, add 0.1 ml to each square. this much liquid will saturate the square so add it dropwise and let it dry (absolute ethanol will disappear quickly under the heat of a lamp) between drops. each blotter square will have a dose of 500ug (prob not more than +/- 50ug if you&#039;re careful). whilst this won&#039;t be super accurate this is a lot safer than eyeballing sub mg doses. <br /><br />one last thing- keep your solution in the fridge and sealed, if the ethanol evaporates obviously the concentration will increase and your next batch of blotters will have higher dosage.

				the molecule won&#039;t be unstable with respect to hydrolysis so no worries there. anhydrous ethanol would be best if you&#039;re making up blotters simply for the quick evaporation. you can buy 95% EtOH on ebay, it&#039;s perfectly safe to order. the other 5% is methanol, which is obviously nasty but even if you didnt evaporate it and just consumed 0.1ml of your solution, you&#039;d only be consuming a few mg of methanol which will cause you no problems...<br /><br />

If you have an HCL salt then it is really water soluble at around 8mg/ml.<br /><br />If you have the freebase, your best bet is 100% alcohol. Everclear should work if you cant get 100% alc. <br /><br />To make blotters:<br />1) Measure out a proper liquid dose.<br />2) Squirt it on a piece of paper.<br />3) Let it dry. <br /><br />The blotter will have to be fairly larger than your typical LSD blotter but it will work just the same. Hope that helps!

				I have read some successful reports of insufflating the subject. The man was in the very same situation, so he just divided the whole pack in two 25mg halves, then one of them in two 12.5, few more iterations gave him something like 0.7mg which is a bit lower than an average dose - nice way to start experimenting. Then just snorted the material, which was really easy due to really small amounts.&nbsp; It is not the way I would suggest you, but it is still an option. If you will stick with this technique, pay your attention to careful dividing, as it is essential to achieve relative accuracy.

				Trying to eyeball a 0.7mg dose is asking for trouble. Powdered substances are not easy to divide and get accurate measurements, especially when you are dealing with sub mg doses. What looks like two even clumps of nbome could be way off - if some of the powder clumps together then two even piles could be very different in weight. Imagine two even looking piles of nbome next to eachother: one pile has a compressed clump in it and the other pile is fluffy - the fluffy one may look like more but could weigh half as much as the first pile. <br /><br />Just dilute it in a solution for easy measurement or buy a mg scale - although I doubt a cheap $20 .001g scale would be sufficient for such small doses.
