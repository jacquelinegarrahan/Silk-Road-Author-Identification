				Yesterday, I made the unfortunate choice of using my local library to transfer funds. This resulted in $100 catching fire before my very eyes when my network administrator booted me off of the computer. I had written the unique url down, however, I can&#039;t seem to get to my specific instawallet. <br /><br />instawallet.org/w/qnXzsSWoEAH0yrbYdHWNYytsqyb7eGQ - I copied it down on a piece of paper, but must have gotten something wrong. <br /><br />The receiving address was 12dpusbAeorDm6GUEwSByxbnXpMwhXybQm- Sorry I mistyped it!<br /><br />the exact amount transferred was 8.941 btc<br /><br />If you can get that money, great! It is lost to me.<br /><br /><br />Anyways I was trying to transfer funds in my account so I could start selling adderall. If anyone is interested in fronting me a couple of bitcoins for the SR fee, then I will give you 5 30mg IR adderall for your trouble.<br /><br />I have pictures, a SR account, and adderall to back it all up.<br /><br /><br />Edit: I uploaded some screenshots for proof of purchase at bit instant (shows transfer to mtgox, but it might be too compressed to see), my adderall, and an awesome sketch.<br /><br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/8i.png<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/xoe.jpg<br /><br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/xou.jpg<br /><br />Tomorrow I will update this post with a picture of my Mt Gox transfer. <br /><br />Um, I am not familiar with blockchain, but it looks like the money was transferred out the next day if I read this correctly:<br />http://blockchain.info/address/12dpusbAeorDm6GUEwSByxbnXpMwhXybQm

				I tried a few of the most obvious typos, but the URL is at least 1 character shorter than any Instawallet I have ever used...any chance there was a doubled character that you missed, or a 1 hiding in your note?

				I most likely left off some characters due to my frantic add brain. anyways the logs are deleted after each session. I even pleaded with the branch&#039;s tech people to look for a network log, but I guess they are too awesome to store them. The money is gone for me which is a bummer, but I can&#039;t do anything about it now. <br /><br />anyways the offer still stands and I will post my pgp*** key in a bit.

Not entirely sure how else they could have been transferred. Perhaps somebody a little better qualified than myself will come along soon and be able to help you further.

				I am guessing that the libraries technical staff may have transferred the funds out. I called them in an attempt to get a history log, but who knows. <br /><br />
