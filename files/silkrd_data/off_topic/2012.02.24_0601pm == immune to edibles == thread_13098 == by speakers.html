				well i bought cookies from one vendor brownies from another and all I feel is a bit sleepy. The brownie I had tasted really strong the guy said I would feel half of one. I ate the whole thing felt a little buzz 30 min it ate 2 more and just layed on the couch feeling lethargic untill i fell asleep. Is that what the high is like? Ive never been able to achieve anything passed the tired feeling of not wanting to stand.

				eating that many brownies will make u fall asleep. brownies generally take like an hour or so to fully start kicking your ass. you could have eaten too much and just passed out. you still would feel a huge body high from 1 solid brownies unless u have a mega tolerance.

				You don&#039;t tell us your usage tolerance.<br />It must be pretty high.<br /><br />The only way to know is to make your own edibles.<br />and yes you can get &quot;immune&quot; to them.<br />Also fat based edibles get you a bigger buzz, sugar based more for pain.<br /><br />Just stop smoking, and eating cannabis for a few weeks.<br />

				It&#039;s high tolerance, weak edibles.&nbsp; I&#039;ve eaten Delta&#039;s brownies and OSO&#039;s liquid thc, neither had effect on me.&nbsp; Pretty much given up on edibles unless I&#039;m the one producing them, in which I actually will feel them if I adjust it to my tolerance.

				Holly, you got it!<br /><br />Speakers, yes make your own cannabutter.<br />Here go to rook&#039;s page http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/14817<br />We use trim because it makes cheap butter thats very potent.<br />I oz per 1 stick of butter. Killer strong 2oz per stick of butter.<br />Go to youtube and learn how to make cannabuter.<br />It&#039;s easy, just messy, and a few tools help.<br />Keep washing butter, and chilling butter until water is clear, and not green.<br />Now buy those premix cookie packages, one for each stick of butter.<br />Try to keep the heat down when cooking as thc vapes at 320F<br />Add lecithin to the mix, aids in digestion of thc to liver.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I now decarb my trim before I do all the stuff above, but learn to do the stuff above 1st.<br /><br />Uniwiz<br />

				When I make my own brownies I use schwag with a ratio of roughly 1.3g per brownie. My tolerance is obnoxiously high (smoke daily before bed) but my brownies will still put me on my ass for a good three hours at a time!

				I recommend BHO chocolates. A buddy of mine made an absolutely RIDICULOUS batch of BHO chocolates. I think it was like 1.5-2gs of oil per ice cube sized chocolate square. The high lasted for a little over 14 hours, and was excruciatingly strong. I think I stayed awake for about 5 hours through the whole high. Obviously you don&#039;t have to make them that strong, but it&#039;s very quick and simple. Just melt your chocolate in a double boiler, incorporate your oil until it&#039;s not visible, pour into ice cube trays preferably, and enjoy when cooled. Hell, you can even use claim.

				I made a small batch of some extra strong brownies and they went in a day, I also priced them a lot lower then other vendors too but I still got feedback on them.<br /><br />After making brownies for years (some for myself, some for friends, friends of friends e.t.c) and experimenting I think the secret to making good brownies is in the cannabutter, I use trim from A/B grade weed, popcorn buds, 1 or 2 monster nugs, moroccan hash, afghan hash to make a DEADLY batch.<br /><br />don&#039;t have to worry about making different batches of various potency brownies/edibles either cos when there done I just take them out the oven, break out the tape measure and I can do some calculations and cut them to size. (e.g 1 pan of brownies = 12 EXTRA STRONG brownies /or/ 18 Strong /or/ 24 Medium strength e.t.c<br /><br />so yeah, i&#039;m stoned. <br /><br />mr speakers, PM me on Silk Road and I&#039;ll send you a lil something for free when I make a new batch
