				I LOVE Tails. It&#039;s so simple, it&#039;s so clean, it&#039;s so smooth and fast.<br /><br />Has anyone thought of getting a simple netbook and reinstalling it over the main OS and using it as your actual OS, and setting up an encrypted persistent drve out of the main hard drive?<br /><br />Ever since I&#039;ve been using Tails, I haven&#039;t loaded my main OS since. I use this all the time. I simply love it. It&#039;s so well done, anonymous, plus, it has a regular un-torified browser so you don&#039;t have to worry about super slow speeds if you want to check the clearnet.<br /><br />Lovelovelove it.

				i run it from a USB, i need Windoze for a few apps. you can&#039;t do things like watch youtube videos through tails as it doesn&#039;t have flash, and installing it on persistence is a proper ballache

				Hmm, how is it a ballache to you? It was incredibly simple for me. I use my USB Tails too, but I also have a laptop. I&#039;m thinking of simply buying a netbook and installing Tails on that. I use my iPad for YouTube mainly. <br /><br />Honestly, I use my iPad for all of my web browsing, except Tor (there&#039;s an Onion Browser on iOS, but nty). There&#039;s no Flash on iOS devices either, so I&#039;m not hurting for it. ProTube, a jailbroken YouTube app, allows watching even non-mobile videos, downloading video and audio, plus more. Great, great app.<br /><br />But Tails... Tails I could use as my main OS easily. I technically already do.

				installing anything on tails persistence is a ballache - anything that involves more than &#039;next&#039; &#039;next&#039; enter password &#039;install&#039; is a ballache. i can do it - i have a bitcoin wallet installed on tails, but just can&#039;t be arsed. and like i said, there are a few apps that only run on windoze or the mac/*nix equivalent is shite. tails is just for SR for me, has my pgp keys, wallet and tormail going through claws mail and that&#039;s it. then if someone (the mrs/kids) sneak up behind me while i&#039;m on it i can just pull the key out of the machine and i&#039;m totally innocent 0O<br /><br />i user OnionBrowser on my iPhone, just to browse and come on here - works pretty well

				Do you log into your main accounts on Onion Browser? Because I don&#039;t. That terrifies me. I use it on my iPhone and iPad, but just never for anything like replying to actual comments.<br /><br />I see what you mean by ballache though. Yeah, I understand. But for a basic webbrowsing tool and word editor, it&#039;s flawless. That&#039;s mainly what I use it for. If I&#039;m doing any type of image editing, I use my rMBP. <br /><br />I just rarely use it now. I enjoy the simplicity of Tails too much. For the tools that REQUIRE Windows/Mac/*nix, I obviously use a different distro. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just a faggot hipster or something. &quot;REGULAR LINUX IS TOO MAINSTREAM, MANNNN.&quot;<br /><br />Liberte... Looking it up.

				nah i use a throwaway account on the OnionBrowser to check stock on the main site and to see if there&#039;s anyone on here.<br /><br />couldn&#039;t really get on with Liberte, dunno why i just didn&#039;t like it.

				I like how Tails is laid out, but if I&#039;m in a Barnes and Noble or Starbucks, I&#039;ll turn on the XP disguise mode. (And yeah, Jack, I CRACKED up. I hadn&#039;t actually seen XP in years, and I saw that and just ROFL&#039;d. Pidgin is Windows Messenger... Oh man, hahahaha). If a good computer user sees it, it&#039;s obviously not XP, but nobody would know what I&#039;m doing.<br /><br />Even if I&#039;m using Tails, it&#039;s not like it&#039;s illegal, so I&#039;m not too paranoid about that. But, I do like to switch it up if I go to the same place... which I rarely do. I never go back to a wifi hotspot I&#039;ve used to make a purchase.<br /><br /><br />Exactly how much more anonymous is Liberte, if you know off the top of your head (or if it&#039;s measurable)?

				I see. I&#039;ll look into it. Not being a vendor, I feel very safe with Tails, however. You, on the other hand, I can imagine needing every ounce of protection you can get.<br /><br />Thank you.

				Tails is nice.&nbsp; I never have to access anything from my home and it&#039;s probably the safest way to be doing things like this.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the cost.&nbsp; I can&#039;t tell you how many times I have needed to access Tor somewhere where i&#039;ve had to use it.&nbsp; I can basically dispose of it without caring or effort, too.

				I rarely use avatars on forums, but it&#039;ll be funny to see if onion.to caches my avatar as well. And now we wait.

It won&#039;t back you up in court, so I find it an unnecessary precaution; whereas switching hotspots CAN make it more difficult to find me, thus improving my safety. <br /><br />Nobody in real life (minus one or two VERY close people) know about my drug use and underground activities. I do a lot more than just SR (nothing violent; that&#039;s my favorite thing about this place), and I feel safer knowing that I take all of these precautions. You can never be TOO safe.<br /><br />And thank you--someone must&#039;ve been REALLY mad that I spamed to 50 in the &quot;Spam to 50!&quot; thread. Hahahaha.
