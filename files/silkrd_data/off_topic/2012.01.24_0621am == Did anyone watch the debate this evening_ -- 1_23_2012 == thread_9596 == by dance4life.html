				Can you seriously believe everyone but Dr. Paul is for keeping Cuba shut out and then they were lamenting about Castro&#039;s death like it was going to bring peace and prosperity to the world?&nbsp; Wtf is wrong with these people - not only that but the drones that would vote for one of them.. not sure what is worse.<br /><br />At this point if you are not voting for Dr. Paul you are a traitor to the constitution and this country.

				what the hell is the point anymore?<br /><br />you go up to anybody, and i mean anybody on the street and ask them if they think politicians are corrupt and i almost guarantee you that 90% of them will say, &quot;yes.&quot;<br /><br />this country is going to shit, it&#039;s going to get worse before it gets better - and no amount of voting is going to change that. what will change it is a fucking revolution - and we&#039;re still at least 100 years away from something like that possibly happening.<br /><br />the fall of rome took decades, if not centuries - none of us will be alive to see any real change.

				That&#039;s weak.<br /><br />Get your ass out and vote for Paul.&nbsp; If you live in a closed primary state you may have to switch to Republican.&nbsp; Anyone else and we are headed towards your scenario.

				I would expect of all places Silk Road would be largely into Paul and this election.&nbsp; Just seems so lackadaisical.. no one really gives a shit.. or if they kinda do care they have better things to do than try to take back this country from the machine.

				all you&#039;re doing is voting for which politician is going to be taking money and bribes from the real leaders of this country...<br /><br />the corporations and the banks.<br /><br />wake the fuck up, voting does nothing.<br /><br />how about we occupy DC until being a &#039;politician&#039; is no longer a career path but a service to your fucking country.<br /><br />these douche-bags in the house/senate get 6 figure salaries, several weeks of vacation a year, killer health benefits, and a retirement package that you nor i will ever have. i would LOVE to have a job where i get to vote for my own pay raises and benefits.... where did this shit come from?<br /><br />not to mention the perks, free dinners, transportation, and accommodations.<br /><br />if you really think who you vote for makes any difference THEN YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

				yea um, actually, i&#039;ve attended several &#039;occupy&#039; rallies and have talked to hundreds of people about why we shouldn&#039;t be protesting &quot;wallstreet&quot; but we need to be protesting our now bloated and inept government. what the fuck have you done other than cast a ballet for some fat, overpaid, corrupt official?<br /><br />wallstreet is a symptom of a greater problem, and that is the politicians ON BOTH SIDES which LET THEM RUN THIS COUNTRY.<br /><br />we have the technology to have a true democracy in this day and age, yet we&#039;re still tied to a ancient representative system that is outdated and being abused to turn our nation into a Inverted Totalitarian Kleptocracy<br /><br />CLEARWEB LINK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism<br /><br />some people got it, but most of the people just wanted to put all the blame on Bush for fucking this country up or wanted to blame Obama for not doing enough to make &quot;that change.&quot;<br /><br />Fucking sheep lead by fucking puppets.<br /><br />Again... WAKE UP.
