				I think I speal for all when I say GTFO!<br /><br />In case you haven&#039;t read the rules of SR we don&#039;t allow anything which could harm, including guns and explosives. The Armory used to provide this service, but its gone now. Thank God. <br /><br />Long live SR! Long live DPR!

They&#039;re putting together their own deepweb Armory site.<br /><br />Alternatively, I have a cousin twice-removed in Nigeria that has a couple of guns and boxes of C-4 that he has to get rid of; apparently he recently became a prince and has to get these out of Nigeria for some reason. I&#039;m sure he&#039;d be happy to send you his entire arsenal for the small sum of à¸¿599.99 which you can pay him via Western Union. Just send it to Prince Nkombe Ogunye, Nigeria with a message saying &quot;Dedication for the Prince&quot; and he&#039;ll know what it&#039;s about.

				True, but a person can&#039;t shoot another with his meth pipe. Or pack enough herion in a building to level it......self harm is one thing. If you want to buy a gun to kill yourself I&#039;m all for it....just not others. If you want to blow yourself up...even better! Just not others.

I just made the assumption based on the American-centric statement above. SR is a global site, and many countries Arms laws are incredibly restrictive. I presume the OP is living somewhere other than the US and can&#039;t just purchase a gun in a local store, hence their turning to the deepweb in order to secure one. As bad an idea as that may be..&nbsp; :-\ <br /><br />Either way this discussion should be taking place in The Armory forum rather than the Off-Topic section of the Silk Road forum so the OP should bring their query there instead.

				I did mean it in the most derogatory of ways haha BUT then I watched the news and seen FEAR (forever enduring always ready) Fuck yeah an American revolution!! A group of freedom fighters and they have been blowing up judicial and political cars and shit! Im so psyched dude maybe there is hope after all&nbsp; ;D I&#039;m ready to bust some ass I&#039;m so sick of Americas bullshit!! I&#039;m honestly ready for an uprising and I&#039;m ready to fuck shit up until they kill me or I do hahaha as Thomas Jefferson said &quot;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants and patriots&quot; you see I love America as a country and I love how America was when it was created but because of todays police and todays politicians and because of people constantly raping the constitution and last but not least the repeated rape/sodomy/defecation/and spitting on the rights of humans.As for the OP you can PM me and we can talk encrypted and not on silk road sorry man Im not going to discuss selling weapons,poisons,bombs,or anything like that on the forums I love this site way to much to get banned&nbsp; :D

Why is everyone here on this website?

I know thats why you&#039;re mad,you&#039;re mad because I talked shit about America.But you and everyone that supports the gun trafficking,constitution raping,right invading,lie and propaganda spreading,u.s. government and politicians.You&#039;re a sheep you listen to everything that the government and the media tells you,you are nothing but a sheep being herded by the Shepard a.k.a. the u.s. government and society.You are so naive and ignorant.Look up the guns that Hilary the Obtuse gave to the &quot;free Syrian army&quot; the guns and money are provided by your beloved country...Now that all seems fine until you watch what the FSA is actually doing with the weapons.Go to documentingreality.com,bestgore.com,ogrish,or any real videos of people being killed or people dying.Go ahead and see a gun that you paid for with your tax money completely obliterate the skull of a toddler then watch them step on the brains of the toddler then tell me how much you love your government.They took your money that you worked for then they used that money to buy the gun that was used to kill children,women,men,animals,and anything that breaths.Anyway like I said you&#039;re a sheep and you know nothing besides what the government has told you since birth.Seriously take what you&#039;ve heard about the war in Iraq or the Syrian uprising or &quot;the brave mujaheed&quot; and then look up what is really happening over there you can trust no authority because they will and ALWAYS have lied to the sheep to keep them from knowing the truth.Instead of admitting they are stupid and fucked up they deny and cover it up.Our government is one of the stupidest in the world (it wasn&#039;t when it was first created but the Constitution has been desecrated and shamed so many times since then with all morals and common sense and most of the free thinking in the country gone) you piss me off..I love my land or &quot;Country&quot; but I despise our government.Fuck pigs,fuck the power hungry politicians,fuck the laws the dont regard violent crimes (murders,assaults,domestic violence,rape,ect...) and stealing of any kind.Fuck you dont take anyones word about anything research shit for yourself.Everyone in the world lies so why expect the government to tell you the truth.Anyway keep supporting them and fighting pointless wars of the government keep supporting the violence of the pigs and keep letting them restrict you and hold the population down with fucked up tyrannical laws and you will soon be trapped in a police state.
