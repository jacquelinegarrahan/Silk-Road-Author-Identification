				MDMA sex is brilliant! so passionate and sensual, ecstacy to coin a phrase! :P Coca-ethylene sex is fucking hardcore! Just not too pissed, you need the right balance. Booze &amp; coke just sends me rampin&#039;!! Opiates, you just last forever and stay hard as fuck!! Girls who don&#039;t use H and get fucked by a person on H have the best time!! <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had sex on hallucinogens. Never been mentally stable enough to pull or even think about it when I&#039;m this way!! Never done any with a partner as I never used them much since I was really young or with small groups of friends until recently...This may change now I&#039;m doing more of them.....Will be a strange one!

But you have to take a relatively low dose of lsd - about 110- 150ug - just one blotter. Also make sure you&#039;ve &quot;peaked&quot; and are coming down slightly - say 3 hours into the trip. And you have to time the hit of poppers to perfection - just before the orgasm. Then it magnifies it almost infinitely... :D

				kinkier, bottom line. also a mandatory come up shag in my opinion on mescaline come ups (lots of those recently, have lots of mescaline, hit me up if you want any) its definitly too much in the past on shrooms, dont feel like shagging while watching my bitches tits wobble a bit more than they normally should. and drunk sex aint my thing either. but mdma IF YOU CAN GET A BONER is amaaaaaaaaaaazing and also mescaline come up shag is a mandatory part of the process.<br /><br />my .02BTC

Sounds a lot more complicated than it was. I&#039;ll give it a try again some time over the next few months and make a proper report. Maybe it wont happen the second time...

				i&#039;m not so sure about weed... but the empathy enhancement of mdma does wonders for intimacy and out of all psychedelics, i&#039;d say 2c-b is the best for sex purposes. i&#039;ve heard GHB enhances sex but i haven&#039;t had a chance to try it out yet. sex while coming down from adderall is also wonderful and really helps with the comedown

				Sex is awesome even without drugs. Anything else is a bonus! I hear conflicting reports about MDMA+Viagra, but enough people have been doing it for so long to know that its pretty safe at reasonable levels. I hear 2CB (at pre-halluncination doses) is real nice too.

				For me it&#039;s either MDMA, Cocaine or Crystal Meth. MDMA and Coke for me definitely enhance the already pleasurable art of sex, however, Crystal Meth makes me fuck like crazy and delivers really intense orgasms that I wish would never end. It is really just simply a matter of individual preference as a lot of drugs can affect people differently. I would say that no matter what your on, the feeling of sexual pleasure is greater than what&#039;s normally experienced. :)

				Since starting this thread, I can confirm that I have now tried 2 of the suggestions provided:<br /><br />1. MDMA<br />2. Cocaine<br /><br />The MDMA experience was good. My partner and I did feel very tactile and sensitive. I did manage to get hard but found that it came and went quite often as my mind would wander.<br />Once I was inside her, it felt really good and it lasted really long. It was unconventional sex l less orgasm-focussed and much more sensual. For about 30 mins I was inside her just talking. OK, it was good, but, Im not sure it was the drug enhancing sex as much as the fact that sex enhances the enjoyment of the drug. 8/10<br /><br />Cocaine wasn&#039;t great. It was OK and felt good, but tooooo much of a drag to cum. Decent orgasm when it came though. 3/10

				MDMA sex is amazing. It lasts a really long time, which is nice, and it does get much more sensual. It&#039;s nice that my boyfriend goes slower and pays more attention to my lady bits, instead of the main focus being getting off. Sometimes is can be absolutely impossible to have an orgasm though, which can be really frustrating if you&#039;re at it so long that you start coming down.<br />Tried sex on Adderall last week. It made my entire body tingle and every touch sent shivers through my entire body. Probably one of only two times I&#039;ve had multiple orgasms.

				For those saying X makes you last longer, who gives a crap.<br /><br />Sex is great when you&#039;re in the moment, not when you&#039;re thinking holy crap I&#039;m gonna bust a nut any second.<br /><br />Girls don&#039;t care that much either. Sex is a beast with lots of avenues to explore.<br /><br />Live a care-free curious intimate life all.

				I personally think sex is best when you are sober.&nbsp; You remember it and can be you.&nbsp; But I sure as hell wouldn&#039;t turn it down while on something.

That would feel great, of course, but it feels great no matter what. Poppers are just fucking awesome. I find it&#039;s best somewhere in the middle of it all. Halfway between getting horny and cumming. <br /><br />And yes, they can be used to facilitate anal sex, but they&#039;re good for anything sexual. Just magnifies all sensations and gives you an awesome head rush for a couple minutes. And then you do it again, and again, and again.
