				Hi MedicalTrials.<br /><br />Well done on helping out your sick family member, hopefully the oil can do the same for that person as Rick Simpson&nbsp; says he has done for thousands of others.<br /><br />While I was visiting my buddy in LA a few weeks ago (I&#039;m not far from where you are), his mother got taken ill, and it turned out she has Stage IV Breast Cancer, which has spread to many other areas. I&#039;m doing my best to locate some oil for her, but that stuff is hard to come by. I&#039;ll be very interested in your stuff when you have some available. When do you think this will be?
