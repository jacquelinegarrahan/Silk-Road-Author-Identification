				Hi, <br />I&#039;m planing on a mdma trip to the land of hardcore this Friday (if the shipment will come:), but the thing is i have enjoyed a bit of Methylone (bk-mdma) past 3 weeks... Not much, maybe about 300mg combined (i just do micro-doses, snort from a key, just to sober up and relax:). Can this affect my plans? I have read that if you overplay with methylone - mdma effects can be very disappointing afterward :). But i think that these 300mg during ~3 weeks are not considered too much? <br />In any case is there anything, that i can do to help to rebuild something that methylone could have destroyed in me? :) And what about bruxism, i have read that people use something (magnesium?) with mdma, to relax the jaw. Because the thing that i hate about mdma is waking up the next day with destroyed inner chin (mouth;)... <br /><br />one more question about the dosing. I&#039;m planing about 200mg and 100mg after an hour for me, and ~150 + 100 for my firend, cause he&#039;s a complete beginner... hm.. but he weights about +5/7kg then me (me - ~73kg)&nbsp; so maybe 2000mg+100mg for him too?<br />Thanks in advance
