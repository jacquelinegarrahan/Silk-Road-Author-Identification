				Silk road and the bans on drugs is killing research. Before silk road and before the federal ban, we had hopes that new compounds like 4-methyl-MDA ,6-mAPB, and MAL-NBOMe would come out. Now there is really no hope.

				I think we help the research by buying RC and testing it on ourselves. This is that way LSD has been discovered (Mr. Hoffman accidently exposed himself to the drug) and this is that way we are able to find new medications sometimes. Heroin was a wide used medicament 100 years ago sold by Bayer, Cocaine has been used too as cough syrup&nbsp; ;D If you want to see some photos (clearnet): http://www.squidoo.com/heroin-cocaine-remedies

				Perhaps this could be true.<br /><br />Testing it on yourself for research is just silly. It&#039;s not considered science, just (recreational) experimenting.<br /><br />There is a huge struggle to get drugs away from bad attention in order to do legal research with stuff to treat ptsd, depression, etc.<br />I&#039;m not very clear in seeing a link between sr and the war on drugs (and research). It will always be sold on the streets. And perhaps it even balances out: less on the streets, more on sr?<br /><br />Either way, banning research is retarded. Against the pharmaceutical industries laws usually and against our freedom (of thinking and doing) and gaining insights.<br />In the past we&#039;d be burned for doing so, nowadays we get locked up in prison or an asylum.<br />Stupid corrupt government crap. Wake up, geez.

				I know of a number of research&nbsp; studies that is going on at the moment quite a few studies on Special K on depression and even opiate withdrawal MDMA research is always on going , we dont get to hear about it in the media unless its sensationalist headlines have to agree with @virmo testing is not considered science , however when the &#039;legal highs&#039; were legal I knew a number of people that would test them, and this provided workers in the field with alot of knowledge of the drug around re dosing , the come down etc. The problem&nbsp; is now the &#039;head shops&#039; have been closed down all the stuff via the net (not necessarily SR ) is unknown so people dont know what they are taking now Research needs to carry on some good info comes from pill reports , thank God otherwise we would be none the wiser. Research at the end of the day makes it safer for everyone and there fore research can and does save lives
