				I took a 2 mg xanax (135 lb male) on a very full stomache accidently. It fell in&nbsp; a glass of water so i thought fuck its now or never. It about an hour and a half and I feel pretty sedated. I drank 1 mix drink at the bar and half a beer. I feel simliar to being drunk to be honest but not quite. I don&#039;t feel nausesas just chilled out and tired. Is this really a xanax high because its not that glorious at all idk why people pursue I was expecting euphoria since it relives anxiety but who knows.<br /><br />If anyone can describe it I&#039;ll find out if I am feeling it.

				well yea obviously but this is my introduction to benzos. One 2 mg xnax bar is the first time I&#039;ve tried benzos and I want to know what it feels like, Someone just explain it becauase I can&#039;t tell if this is a coincidence or not. Especially since the onsest should be 20 mintes but I&#039;m feeling effects an hour and a half after them btu I am really tired and its kind of late here now.

				I&#039;m benzo noob too. Tried xanax once after work. I remember taking xanax, hitting a bong couple of times and starting to watch a movie. Next thing I remember is waking up in the morning. I was undressed and all, PC turned off. Creepy part - to this day I can&#039;t find mobile phone charger, and I vaguely remember wanting to charge my phone that night. I&#039;m not sure if I want to try benzos again:)

				Perfect if you&#039;ve had a crazy day on.. Acid, MDMA, Speed, Coke... and need to sleep... I normally drop half the bar..feel a little drowsy, then the other half and get into bed... 8 hours guaranteed sleep!!

				It makes you feel like your muscles are melting off of your body into relaxation bliss. You feel light. You have only a dim awareness of what is going on but it is awesome because any problems in your life are completely out of your mind. You could sleep easily and heavily if you wanted to. You are completely relaxed and moderately dulled, mentally physically and emotionally. You are somewhat disassociated, but not to the same extent or in the same way as you would be from, say, ketamine. You may have black outs and amnesia especially on higher doses, and you are also prone to acting like an asshole because your ability to filter your behavior and empathize with others is significantly hindered. Xanax makes you not care about things. <br /><br />It is pretty much the exact opposite of LSD. LSD enhances senses, abstract thinking, emotions, xanax dulls them. LSD stimulates the body, xanax relaxes it. It is really perfect for the come down of LSD or MDMA or anything like that, it really helps a ton especially if you want to sleep but otherwise would have trouble doing so. It also pretty much terminates all but the visual aspects of many psychedelics, LSD + xanax = LSD visuals - LSD mental effects. You need to get used to the effects and build a bit of a tolerance to it to truly appreciate its recreational value imo, if you take 2mg for your first time and without any tolerance you are likely to black out and not remember shit, and to not be able to appreciate the subtle effects it has. It is also very nice to mix with marijuana, especially if you are prone to paranoia or panic attacks. If you take Xanax prior to smoking weed, you will be able to smoke a fuck ton without any worries about becoming paranoid or having a panic attack. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get hooked though, the withdrawals can kill you and it is hell to get off of it without tapering.

				They are all similar but also have their own uniqueness. Xanax is particularly prone to causing amnesia and blackout and is one of the &quot;harder&quot; benzos imo. I have not tried kolonopin but I hear it is very very very strong. Others are more mild in effect, like Valium.

				when I took xanax I felt cartoonishly happy, with maybe some relaxation in there. a very simple high, not very interesting.
