				I tried 4-Fluoroamphetamine the first time a few days ago. While not nearly as wonderful as MDMA, it was still nice and worth what little I paid for it.<br /><br />Well, fellow travelers? Have you had any &quot;firsts&quot; recently?

				In my area Roxy is most folks DOC. No one around here as even really seen H. I have bought some &quot;h&quot; a few times locally. Once it was coffeemate. <br /><br />That being said, I wanted to try H when I found the road. So I ordered from Tony.... fail.<br /><br />Rydivinci hooked me up and burst my H cherry for me, he will always have a place in my heart. <br /><br />So, yes, I banged H for the first time Friday, and I will do so again, of that I have no doubt.

				I learned how to IV recently and IV&#039;d for the first time, and I also tried heroin for the first time somewhat recently. I IV&#039;d dilaudid for the first time just a couple weeks ago and tried mushrooms for the first time around the same time.&nbsp; :)

				Just be careful with the opiates, guys. I&#039;ve lost a couple friends to percocet and heroin addiction. <br /><br />That being said, I certainly had some great times doing H. Have a bit of fun :)

				Trying new things is awesome. Variety is the spice of life! I try to ingest a new substance or try a new combination at least once a week.<br /><br />One recent combination was MXE and cannabis... whatever I watched seemed like it took forever. Interesting time dilation.
