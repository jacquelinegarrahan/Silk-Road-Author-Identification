				Everytime my friends and I take 25i, we get TERRIBLE muscle tension. Its like that feeling you need to stretch, but cant ever do it. At higher doses it is even more unmanageable. <br /><br /><br />My question is to the users who have taken 25c, preferably both, have you noticed there any difference with that feeling or no? Also, does the 25c trip change when compared to 25i?

				I&#039;ve only tried 25i, but my girl and I both get random muscle tension. Perhaps the vasoconstrictive effects of the nBOMe&#039;s contribute to this?

25i-NBOME makes you feel like an alien to your own body and mind and I don&#039;t like it much but take 600mg - 1000mg of cayenne pepper (or any pepper containing high amounts of capsaicin, there&#039;s cheap organic African Bird Pepper, buying the 90000 HU variant is more cost-effective) to reduce vasoconstriction, or buy Gotu Kola dried loose leaf to make as tea, or buy it in capsules (although intake of tea itself adds to the relaxation and vasodilation).&nbsp; Add Gingko Biloba for vasodilation in your mind, so no headaches.&nbsp; Capsules would work, too, but probably less effectively.&nbsp; &lt;500mg (yes, LESS than 500mg) of ground ginger root is good for nausea.&nbsp; Find the minimum dose of ground ginger root to make your nausea go away when you take 25i-NBOME (if it happens to you, doesn&#039;t happen to me but I heard it does for some people) and then fill the rest of the pill with African bird pepper, or add the ginger and African bird pepper into your Gotu Kola/Ginkgo Biloba tea.&nbsp; Buy a $16 milligram scale off of eBay, too.<br /><br />http://www.herbco.com/c-88-african-bird-pepper.aspx African Bird Pepper<br />http://www.herbco.com/p-1128-gotu-kola-cs.aspx Gotu Kola<br />http://www.herbco.com/c-343-ginger.aspx Ginger Root<br />http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/bulkherb/g.html Gingko Biloba<br /><br />There may be better vasodilators but honestly a lot of shit on that last have weird side effects (MAOI&#039;s, carcinogenic, addictive, etc) and these are the best that I&#039;ve found.<br /><br />HALVE YOUR DOSE IF YOU TRY WHAT I SAY, VISUAL AND EMOTIONAL EFFECTS ARE POTENTIATED<br /><br />Happy tripping, although I enjoy 25c-NBOME much, much more.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how my trips compare (I didn&#039;t use my natural vasodilators for either, I may give 25i another chance with them but I still don&#039;t like the mental effects and the visuals annoy me):<br /><br />25i-NBOME (1mg from FoxyMeow), hanging out with friends in suburbs, brushed my teeth 1 hour prior to putting the tab there, brushed the lower gum area with a piece of a paper towel, preloaded with a vitamin pill that had fucking everything in it 1 hour prior to putting the tab there<br />30 minutes in: I&#039;m slightly more interested in nature right now<br />1 hour: One of my friends asked if he could borrow my DS but I just don&#039;t have the mental capacity to fully think what the results of giving it to him would be, vasoconstriction felt, fingers slightly twitchy, feel like I need to stretch.<br />2-5 hours: +2/light +3, in trip mode, ability to think logically impossible, confused, still with friends, still speaking, kind of dysphoric, visuals consist of leaves on trees rearranging into words, branches swirling, faint rainbows in view as if they are overlayed in 2d, asphalt swirling, vasoconstriction at its worst, reminds me of chinese acid ripoff, honestly.&nbsp; The visuals are similar in that they can do a variety of things, but most of them involve swirling instead of the complete freedom acid&#039;s visuals have.&nbsp; Vasoconstriction feels like my blood pressure is being taken all over my body and there&#039;s a vice around my head.<br />5-7 hours: light visuals to none at 7 hour point, vasoconstriction subsiding at 7 hour point, very very very very tired, unable to sleep until 12 hours after I took the tab, mind is very tired the day after, poor performance at school the day after<br /><br />25c-NBOME 600ug from HardHustle (same process as before, only I DIDN&#039;T preload with a vitamin pill)<br />30 minutes in: A smile appears on my face.<br />1 hour: My heart rate increases, and no matter what happens, I can&#039;t stop laughing or smiling.&nbsp; No confusion at all noted.<br />1 1/2 hour: The visuals start with me barely noticing them.&nbsp; Interesting surfaces start to have their patterns rearranging.&nbsp; Very interesting to watch.<br />1 1/2 - 5 or 6 hours: It reaches a plateau around 2 hours in, and it will feel like your skin has an electrical field around it (not uncomfortable, honestly.&nbsp; I feel like Pikachu or Raichu lol.), and you have &quot;infinite happiness energy.&quot;&nbsp; The body load is identical to being stoned, minus the laziness (although lying down on a comfy chair was so comfortable I didn&#039;t get up for an hour and just sat and watched the visuals) and with the feeling of electric skin.&nbsp; Visuals consist of very distinct rainbows and halos emanating from light sources, patterns rearranging themselves into very interesting shapes (think fractal broccoli), no confusion at all during the trip, and I didn&#039;t feel drained at all in the evening or the next day.&nbsp; Very, very fun if you want to trip with strangers but worry if you&#039;ll all freak out because you don&#039;t know each other.&nbsp; 25c-NBOME will open you up and make everyone inviting.<br /><br />You won&#039;t stop smiling for 8 hours, and I had a nice afterglow for a day, but I loved being that happy that I learned how to appreciate life from that perspective all the time.<br /><br />Try 25c, it&#039;s better, but I might try 25i again to see if the lack of vasoconstriction might make it better.

				I have not had unpleasant effects with 25i from doses ranging from 800-1500ug... it is always a great time. Everybody reacts differently to different compounds I suppose.
