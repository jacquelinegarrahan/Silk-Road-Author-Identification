				just starting to come down off the first good roll i&#039;ve had in like 10 yrs.&nbsp; got some of dopeboy&#039;s which was just gorgeous stuff never personally seem shard as nice.&nbsp; my parter rolled for her first time and loved it..&nbsp; &nbsp;it was soo nice to roll with somebody you truly love.&nbsp; &nbsp;none of the feelings were purely chemical we were feeding off each other.<br />she passed out early..&nbsp; kinda lonely here hehe.<br /><br />just did half a bag of some (non-SR and way too expensive) NYC dope to soften up here at the end.&nbsp; that&#039;s such a rare thing for me to have, an opiate and MDMA simultaneously.&nbsp; i never mix them directly together..&nbsp; the opiate will kill my roll..&nbsp; but wow when coming down it brings back it&#039;s own unique euphoria mixed with the tail of the MDMA 8)<br /><br />absolutely love it.&nbsp; this has been a wonderful night and i&#039;m so happy this community exists and has treated me so well...&nbsp; to all the legit buyers and sellers on here, from newbie to long established..&nbsp; i love you guys for making SR work!&nbsp; ;D It gives me some hope for the future..&nbsp; maybe one day things like this will make the drug war utterly impossible to win.&nbsp; <br /><br />i am one satisfied girl that i can definitely say...<br /><br />*destiny*
