				Master &amp; Commander is my favorite movie, how freaky is that&nbsp; :) 3 people here who all love it despite it not being that well known or have anything to do with illegal activities or drugs.<br /><br />Definitely the first Matrix movie is a close second, I hate the other two though, they should never have made them.<br /><br />Stargate is third, but that&#039;s not to everyone&#039;s taste.<br /><br />Also: Casino, Goodfellas, Rock N&#039; Rolla, Snatch, Layer Cake... are all obligatory&nbsp; :)

				Stargate was a movie that more than held its own.&nbsp; Great cast, great script and cool use of cinematography.<br />They killed it by making a low budget series about it, really.&nbsp; I still cant believe it lasted as long as it did.&nbsp; But seeing as Richard Dean Anderson was one of the main sponsors, he probably kept it alive.<br />Also, did you know that RDA had a fear of guns?.&nbsp; How the hell does that work out.

				Love Kung-fu Hustle - Honors and makes fun of the genre all at the same time :)&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Asian side of things - Watch &quot;Old Boy&quot; fucking awesome and The departed was great but the movie it copied, &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; is better.&nbsp; Also some good Samurai flicks are &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (fist full of dollars was copied from this one) and its sequel &quot;Sanjuro&quot;... and I am always entertained by the original Zatoichi - they made tons of those<br /><br />For US productions always liked the artistic quality of &quot;Sin City&quot;, the darkness of &quot;fight club&quot; and &quot;seven&quot;&nbsp; and the classic movies like &quot;The good, the bad and the ugly&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;For drug movies Super Troopers, Pineapple Express and I liked Harold and Kumar Christmas much better than I anticipated

				Trainspotting is an awesome movie.&nbsp; It shows what life in scotland is actually like for a lot of the poorer folk.&nbsp; <br />Ewan McGregor deserved a fuckin oscar for this.<br />Gran Torino is awesome too.&nbsp; Has anyone seen Harry Brown?.&nbsp; Its basically the same principle story but the guy is an ex-marine who served in northern ireland, so hes got the training to actually take out the fuckers one by one.&nbsp; Well worth watching.<br />Although americans might want it in subtitles!!

				Harry Brown! - class class film.<br /><br />here are a few of my favs. ( in no particular order )<br /><br />Memento - class film with great acting and twist.<br />Troll Hunter ( if you like hand held camera films this is a must ) <br />Home Movie ( again hand held - slow to starts but builds to the crazyness of a slipknot video )<br />shutter island ( loved this movie - a definate must watch twice film )<br />Requiem for a dream ( although dated now its&nbsp; a truly brilliant film in every way )<br />Love honour and obey ( brilliant film in the lock stock style but seemed to go under the radar - if you enjoyed lock stock its a must )<br /><br />Love watching movies so will probably update this thread further as more movies pop into my head.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Went to see the new Spiderman with my son over the weekend and wasn&#039;t too impressed.<br /><br />Watched The Wind That Shakes the Barley last night and that was a damn good movie.<br /><br />I like Last Samurai, Robin Hood, Braveheart, Apocolypto for action type movies.<br /><br />Comedian Ralphie May &#039;Too Big to Ignore&#039; is too fucking funny. Its on Netflix. Had me rolling on the floor. Can&#039;t remember the last time I laugh that hard.<br />Fear and Loathing was good but The Rum Diaries seemed kind of slow.<br /><br />Have to pass on a lot of the recent movies. They pump shit out that isn&#039;t worth sitting through.<br /><br />

				You know when I read &quot;frying balls on lucy&quot;&nbsp; I don&#039;t think of sid - I think of the first Crow movie... I love fear and loathing in Las Vegas, my favorite scene is when he wakes up and the suite that is trashed/flooded with Depp wearing the alligator tail with a chicken in the room because a few times in my life I have been in almost the exact same situation - Probably the same reason I like Hangover so well too<br /><br />I think people like &quot;Watchmen&quot; because they think they like it&#039;s aesthetic qualities - but to me man 3 fucking hours! Really? and even through all that the story kind of sucked.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t focus on anything for a few minutes let alone 3 hours - Some of the movies that are great for their constant action are &quot;The Rundown&quot; 104 minutes with the Rock &amp; Seann William Scott , Ong Bak 104 Minutes and &quot;the Raid&quot; 101 minutes....&nbsp; Speaking of Seann William Scott, just finished watching &quot;Goon&quot; 92 minutes and a kick ass movie - I was expecting a shit movie but this one is definitely a guy show.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also if you want watch a action movie your chick will dig too - check out &quot;Chocolate&quot;&nbsp; where a thai autistic girl kick the crap out of a bunch of guys to collect money for her mom with cancer.... for some reason chicks love it when a girl thrashes a bunch of men - hey its a win win for you all

				@ EnemyOfTheState.<br /><br />I must admit that the trailers ive seen for the &quot;new&quot; spider man looked pretty shit.&nbsp; WAY too much cgi.<br />If you want a movie with believable CGI then i highly recommend District 9.&nbsp; You might be a bit put off by the South African accent but its a big budget movie with great effects.&nbsp; You wont be disapointed.<br />&nbsp;

				I watched Tenacious D and the pick of destiny when I was fucking hammered, and had taken about 40mg of 2c-b. I swear to God I thought that movie was the best thing I had ever seen. But I&#039;m sad to say, I think it was all the drugs

				I caught parts of that movie after getting home from the pub one night.&nbsp; I do not mind spoilers, but did it turn out they were like &quot;jedi&quot; or was it all a bullshit experiment.&nbsp; I know parts of it are supposedly based on real events.

				I will have to check Cinderella man out.&nbsp; I thought Crowe was awesome in &quot;A beautiful mind&quot;.&nbsp; That really did choke me up in parts. The guy can act, but i think he fucked up his reputation due to big-headedness.<br />Anyway on another train of thought, speaking about titty factor, what is that movie with all the cheerleaders in it?<br />(No its not a porno!)<br />And, i do wish i lived in america sometimes!! 8)

Excellent movie, and love the ending. I liked a lot of the cinematography too, some of the scenes of the Olympic Stadium being built right next to the council estate are really thought provoking.

				True. George Lucas was so surprised by the fan backlash when he &quot;killed&quot; Boba Fett that he brought him back in a backasswards way.

As a result, sarlacci have evolved an efficient digestive process. The stomach of a sarlacc slowly dissolves prey into nutrients in a painful process that can last for several thousands of years. Victims are kept alive in the acid-filled stomach throughout digestion and few ever escape. This is one aspect of the sarlacc that makes it such a feared creature. As the droid C-3PO announces (translating for Jabba the Hutt) in Return of the Jedi, &quot;In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years&quot;. If no living prey is available, a sarlacc relies on its root system to absorb nutrients. One sarlacc located on an airless moon feeds on cometary material rich in oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen that drifts into its mouth.<br /><br />The sarlacc&#039;s stomach is lined with a fibrous network of vessels that attach themselves to a swallowed victim. According to the Star Wars Databank, the prey is incorporated into the sarlacc&#039;s biological system as it is digested. Besides digestive acids, the stomach also contains mind-altering neurotoxins which keep victims from struggling and escaping. The toxins induce hallucinations in prey which &quot;suggest that the sarlacc somehow absorbs the intelligence of all its victims, who live on in disembodied torment&quot;. A sarlacc can communicate with its victims through this stolen consciousness. In one Star Wars short story, an old, unnamed Jedi woman who falls into the sarlacc on Tatooine explains that &quot;sarlacci do interesting things with messenger RNA: over the course of millennia, they can attain a sort of group consciousness, built out of the remains of people they&#039;ve digested. I talked to such a sarlacc, once a few decades ago&quot;. She too becomes part of the sarlacc&#039;s consciousness.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s scary as hell if you ask me. So it apparently feeds on your intelligence for thousands of years while you hallucinate the entire time while being digested? That would be a literal version of Hell, yikes! :o

				Any of you guys ever check out the British film &quot;Bronson&quot; it&#039;s a little different but I enjoyed it. <br /><br />Thinking about drug films <br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; was great from what I remember, also liked &quot;pineapple express&quot;, &quot;super troopers&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot; and some of the old cheech and chong movies.&nbsp; Have to make sure I mention Half Baked because the line said by Bob Saget (when they were in addiction counseling) is classic&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana is not a drug. I used to suck dick for coke. Now that&#039;s an addiction.

				Bronson was a great movie, a real treat when i saw it.<br />It really shows what goes on in the mind of a guy like that.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />When they stick him in the nut house and he fucking fights through the drugs they give him, that shows how determined that guy really was.&nbsp; <br /><br />You should read his books, i have one called Solitary Fitness.&nbsp; The guy designed a system of getting huge without needing weights and protein drinks. <br />He has one numerous records for press ups.&nbsp; He even signed a copy of his record and gave it to one of the kray&#039;s, who hung it up in his cell!.

				Went to see The Dark Knight Rises last night with my older son. Without being a spoiler it didn&#039;t end at all like I had thought it would. Another major twist in the plot and the introduction of Robin. Overall a descent flick that keeps your attention.<br /><br />Without hijacking the thread I found myself wondering about certain recent events. The recent shooting in Aurora was at the midnight premier of the third installment of The Dark Knight. According to the timeline police provided to the media the first major &#039;battle scene&#039; w/&nbsp; Bane has lots of shooting and explosions is when the guy went on his rampage. Pretty loud scene. How did the shooter know to utilize that part of the film, or did he? Since no one had seen the film yet how did he know he would be able to use that particular scene to carry out his madness? Just a thought.

				FLUTTERSHY&#039;S MOVIE OF THE DAY<br /><br />Diamond&#039;s Are Forever, the 007 movie from the 70s. Is it a good movie? No, not by any means. But it is probably my favorite Bond movie because it is sooo freaking funny! Seriously, you have Bond being chased in the desert on a moon buggy, a random-ass fight in an elevator, Blofeld in drag for no real reason, Bambi and Thumper, and perhaps the funniest villians Bond has ever had to face, 2 gay hitmen who look like they walked out of a cheap porn. It&#039;s great, and because it&#039;s very colorful throughout, a good movie to watch while either high or drunk! Go find it, now!

				Dont get me started!<br /><br />Terminator 2 was like a kids movie in comparison to the first.&nbsp; And as for the tv series fuck me, whoever came up with that idea needs to be pinned to the wall and shot in the head with a hand-cannon.<br /><br />Come to think of it, James Cameron is like the Michael Bay of science-fiction movies.<br /><br />If anything of recent years, the re-imagined Star Trek movie was awesome on every level.<br />Special effects, casting, direction.&nbsp; JJ Abraham or however the fuck you spell it is a genius.<br />Sure he fucked up with LOST but hey, every director has their highs and lows!.

				I agree as producer, writer director or what ever the fuck he is JJ Abrams he is pretty good - Yeah I still enjoyed Lost even though you could tell they were just making up shit to keep it going, Yeah I liked Alcatraz even though there were plot holes you could drive a truck through and Yeah I like Fringe even though they are doing what they did to Lost and make shit up to keep it going.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought the star trek thing was great and can&#039;t wait for the new one he is going to put out.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The guy who I think is a genius... Vince Gilligan - pretty much has only done two things but those two are the X-Files and Breaking Bad, I wish he would produce more shit but to have those two home-runs on your resume you can pretty much only go downhill from there.&nbsp;

				as long as the idea is put on film, and captured through its essence... terminator looked pretty cool with the special effects and all that.. with the whole set up of judgment day as the end of the world.. but nothing like War of the Worlds. or even Independence day... who directed them ?

				War of the worlds and Independence Day are what i like to call stand-alone films.<br />They are great within their own merits and there is no way a sequel can, or should be made.<br />Such as District 9.&nbsp; Just because the movie is left with an open ending, it doenst mean it should have a sequel.<br /><br />As for Fringe i had to stop watching it for a while.&nbsp; I totally got the feeling they were making it up, when they decided to bring William Bell back from the dead within Olivias body.&nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, seriously.....?

				Fight Club is a classic, three really good actors at the top of their games, with a brilliant story. And the twist at the end... Makes for a good second viewing.<br /><br />Training Day is just brilliant. Again two great actors with an awesome script, great direction, editing, casting and even an cameo from Snoop Dogg. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />What did you guys think of Brooklyn&#039;s Finest (also made by Training Day&#039;s director Antoine Fuqua). I think that went even deeper into the whole world of criminals and police, than Training Day. I don&#039;t think the plot was as engaging, but there were more threads to hang together. All in all a really good, gritty film with some star performances by Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle. With Richard Gere and Wesley Snipes even putting in some good performances.

				Just watched Winter&#039;s Bone tonight - what a bleak but absolutely riveting movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1399683/ - deserves better than 7.3/10.&nbsp; I&#039;d give it an 8.5 - 9.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence - who&#039;s Katniss in the Hunger Games - seems to have that &#039;girl in a world of shit but a turns out to be a tough, persistent motherfucker&#039; character down pat; also John Hawkes - who&#039;s Kenny Powers brother Dustin in Eastbound &amp; Down - is fucking excellent as her mad meth-head uncle.&nbsp; Both of them got Oscar nominations for it - didn&#039;t know this til afterwards though.&nbsp; My missus had been going on about it for a while, to the point where I maybe stuck it on just to shut her up.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s dead basic, you have a fair idea where the plot&#039;s going, but still...great movie.

				Yeah i know.&nbsp; I think it had a small following in our country because it stayed at the top for a few weeks.<br />But generally the opinion across the board is that it is total fail.<br />Well, what do you expect, asides from Blade Runner and one other i cant think of, this is Scotts third ever sci-fi flick.

				I saw the trailers for the dictator and i have to say it looked funny as hell.<br />This is the problem with &quot;comedy&quot; movies these days, like any other movie they will always show you the best parts in the trailers.<br />Thats what killed it for me with Iron Man 2, not a comedy i know, but fuck me was it shit.

				Rauol - I guess Cohens humor is a matter of taste ( and setting too i guess ) - Love Borat - hate Bruno and prefered Ali G back when he was a five minute sketch on the elevven oclock show.<br />True abot the trailers Adasel - every time I watch a comedy im praying its gona be something decent - and usually let down!<br />The dictator had me in stitches from start to finish - no lie.<br />and trust me - theres a lot in the film, to be honest the trailer doesnt do it near enough justice.<br />

				Going to see Dredd this weekend. I wasn&#039;t going to bother, I thought it looked shit at first. Now I&#039;ve seen the reviews (and that it&#039;s an 18! A films got to do a lot nowadays to get an 18, it&#039;s not like the 80&#039;s or 90&#039;sa anymore. Dredd contains &#039;Strong violence and gore&#039;, love a bit of gore me), I think I&#039;ll go. Used to love 2000AD when I was a kid.<br /><br />&quot;I AM the law&quot; 8)
