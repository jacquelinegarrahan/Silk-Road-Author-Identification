				Hello,<br /><br />My girlfriend is having a bit of a stressful patch and struggles to sleep.<br /><br />I was never a fan of things that bring me down, so wanted to ask here.<br /><br />I know that it should be indica, but while with weed strains one can get some info on hash (we prefer since it is easier to ship) it is a lot harder. One type of weed that seems to be good for it is hindu kush, but does it come as hash?<br /><br />What would you, kind people, recommend?

				Nothing better than high quality Moroccan chocolate or Black Afghani from the north, not the stinkysmoky soft border stuff.<br />Dutch skuff aka ice-o-lator will also put you down softly.<br />I guess the market for hash made from HQ weed has yet to come alive in a big style as lots of plant material is needed to sieve the hash.<br />Indian charas is sativa dominant - but then if you have enoug h it will also make you sleep. ;)
