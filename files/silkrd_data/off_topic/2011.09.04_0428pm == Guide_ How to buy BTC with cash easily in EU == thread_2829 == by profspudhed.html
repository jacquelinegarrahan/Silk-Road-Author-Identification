				i know some people out there have trouble getting hold of bitcoins to buy what they want, be it that you dont mine or want more than you can mine, or youd just rather buy your coins with something not connected to a bank account, there seems to be plenty of options for those in the US using greendot moneypack so im focusing this one on europe, i have mentioned these methods in other threads but i thought id give it one of its own, also it lets others add their methods if they have better or just different ones, so heres how i do it<br /><br />first youll need to setup some accounts, feel free to use all the fake info you want for them. <br /><br />setup an account on Second Life: http://secondlife.com/ dont worry youll only have to deal with second life once and it wont cost you anything<br /><br />Setup an account at the virwox exchange: www.virwox.com<br /><br />now youll need to connect your second life avatar to the virwox account, click one of the links on the terminals page on the virwox site to be teleported to a terminal to link your avatar to your account, after this is done you never need touch SL again <br /><br />setup an account at www.neteller.com this is a site for transferring funds to virwox, it makes things much cheaper (as youll see later) also be warned the neteller minimum is 15GBP but that is before comission, so if your voucher is worth £15 they wont take it as its not worth over 15 quid once the commission has come out so remember the minimum is £20 <br /><br />ok thats all the accounts setup now to convert that cash into bitcoins. first youll need either a ukash or paysafecard, you can get them at many newsagents and supermarkets. also remember youre going to lose a bit of cash along the way, obviously no one is giving anything away in this game so commission fees are everywhere, expect to lose at least 5-10% of your cash when exchanging to bitcoins, another slight issue with virwox is that they only trade in whole BTC, not even a single decimal point so expect to have some leftover SLL in your account. now all you need to do is buy either a ukash 18+ voucher or a paysafecard 18+ and follow one of the methods below, ill include commission charges for loading accounts but not the ones between currencies as you get discounts depending on how much you trade so it can be a little variable.<br /><br />Ukash&gt;Neteller(1%)&gt;Virwox(3.5%)&gt;SLL(commission)&gt;BTC(commission)<br />PSC&gt;Neteller(1.75%)&gt;Virwox(3.5%)&gt;SLL(commission)&gt;BTC(commission)<br />PSC&gt;Virwox(20%)&gt;SLL(commission)&gt;BTC(commission)<br /><br />so all in all you will lose slightly less by going with ukash at the moment. the only downside ive found is that rather often virwox can take a day or even two to actually process your withdrawal of btc, sometimes its instant, but usually its up to 24hrs and occasionally longer so its not the best method if you happen to be in a rush, but its the most effective ive found so far&nbsp; <br /><br />there are also several exchanges that offer ukash and paysafecard to liberty reserve USD but many look dodgy and the ones that dont often have terrible rates £1gbp=$1.2USD sometimes even worse than that. im also not terribly trusting of most of the sites so its not a method i have tried personally. hope this helps someone out and if anyone has any suggestions for something with lower fees or less steps please share it<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />it seems neteller no longer accept paysafecard, just ukash<br /><br />UPDATE 2<br /><br />It seems that Intersango/Britcoin now check deposits several times a day so it should be much quicker than the previous 3 days wait you could have got stuck with in the past. i havent tested it out myself just yet but they run a commission free system and you can just walk into a bank in the uk or poland and deposit the cash into their account with a reference code that links it to your account (they only deal in wire transfer/dwolla for euro/USD) this should be a much cheaper way to get coins than the method detailed above. ill update more once ive tried it out for myself though

				You can also use MoneyBookers instead of Neteller. <br />My first impression was horrible, because by the time my 55$ in moneybookers reached my SR account they became ~35$. Second time was better, mainly because I had some SLL and $ left in VirWox account, and since they only exchange round numbers that little bit helps to get more BTC in the end. Also their fees get smaller when you do more exchanging. <br />Since I have my funds in MoneyBookers, VirWox seems to be the only safe option for me.
