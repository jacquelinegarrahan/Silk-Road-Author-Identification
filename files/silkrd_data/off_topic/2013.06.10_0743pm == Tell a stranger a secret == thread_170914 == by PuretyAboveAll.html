After succeeding i felt like shit the next day. oh yea and onetime I \was fucking the chick that at the time I just knew was the one and I kept smelling shit so being a guy I was thinking &quot;dude,&nbsp; did I forget to wipe?&quot; And i kept smelling around and eventually we switched to doggy and when I finally looked down, I was like wtf!?! cuz it looked like a little nugget of shit had gotten trapped between her cheeks and pancaked to both ass cheeks. I very carefully wiped her ass with her panties as not to make her aware of how fuckin gross she is and fake orgasmed and went home. She still does not know to this day hahaha.

				I have grown to hate all of my real life friends. I mean, we all used to be really close, but as time passed I just started hating them. They&#039;re all brainless pop-cultured obsessed monkeys who act as if they&#039;re all lesbians and hate men when in reality the only reason they act that way is because they rarely ever get men looking their way because they act so fucking annoying. The only time they&#039;ve ever fucked any man was when they got shitfaced drunk. This is how two out of three of them have lost their virginity. On a bathroom floor, blacked out. And the next day, when the guys say &quot;lets not get serious&quot;, they act as though they&#039;re straight up gay again. I&#039;ve distanced myself from them because they have made me feel like shit because the person I&#039;ve decided to be&nbsp; for the rest of my life so happens to be a man. They make fun of him just because he&#039;s a boy (he&#039;s doesn&#039;t even believe in straight, gay, etc). He doesn&#039;t give two shits, he tells me &quot;I hate your bitchy fuckin&#039; friends dude&quot; all the time lol, but I mind it. I love men and women equally, I&#039;ve been playing both teams since 13, but the way they act makes me so ashamed to be a bi sexual women, they offend me. And I really wish I could tell them this, but then mob theory comes into play and they act as if they&#039;ve done nothing wrong.<br />So, in short, I have no true friends. I&#039;m a very lonely person when it comes to friends, hence me getting on forums. I really want to meet cool people that I can hang out and talk with without getting so pissed off that I might hit the person, but around where I&#039;m from, everyone is a fucking hipster douchebag. Literally. &gt;:(<br /><br /><br />That felt good to get off my chest.<br />

				*DRUNK POST*<br />What is up with this thread? It seems like some of you blame other people because you cannot relate to them. There are so many people in this world thinking the exact same thing as you. If you have problems finding a real friend, the problem is in yourself. Have you ever tried going for a week or a month just smiling to everyone you see? Have you talked to them and given them a chance to relate to you and you to them, ignoring background, race, gender etc? If you want a friendship to be true, honest and meaningful you have to create it yourself. It is YOU that have the power to create the friendships that you want. Complaining about not having real friends doesn&#039;t even make sense. <br />/blah

It seems like some of you blame other people because you cannot relate to them. There are so many people in this world thinking the exact same thing as you. If you have problems finding a real friend, the problem is in yourself. Have you ever tried going for a week or a month just smiling to everyone you see? Have you talked to them and given them a chance to relate to you and you to them, ignoring background, race, gender etc? If you want a friendship to be true, honest and meaningful you have to create it yourself. It is YOU that have the power to create the friendships that you want. Complaining about not having real friends doesn&#039;t even make sense. <br />/blah<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Well, it would be that easy. I used to be that way, that&#039;s how I made so many friends in the first place.<br />But I&#039;ve been brainwashed into believing that every guy/girl is out to get me for a good while. After that whole mess I was dropped into real life again except with a more paranoid mind set. I have problems establishing normal relationships like I used to. And I&#039;m working on it, believe me (I used to never be able to even talk to people on forums, I&#039;m getting somewhere).<br />And I&#039;ve had true solid friendship with the people I&#039;ve mentioned, I haven&#039;t told the whole story on here because I&#039;d be typing longer than I&#039;d care to about something that has hurt me. They&#039;ve actually done some pretty horrible shit to me that I&#039;d rather not say. <br />And I don&#039;t find it complaining, you want a secret, there ya go. :D<br />And plus, I&#039;m inviting tons of people over and drugging them, if that&#039;s not social then I don&#039;t know what is&nbsp; ;D

				Not a secret but topic starter doesn&#039;t seem to know this:<br /><br />Telling secrets works wonders for well-being in small isolated communities of less than 100ppl like some tribes in africa.<br />In the real world ppl will use what you tell them for their own profit, often by exaggragating your secrets making them into lies trying to blackmail you.

				DAMN! i saw this thread when it started and avoided it , wish i had jumped straight in. Lesson learned.<br />some shit made me seriously laugh like fuck! &quot;Boom headshot&quot; you fucking legend. Trying to fist your ass while on shrooms :o whatever floats your boat i suppose. <br /><br />And emptying a vat of LSD into a towns water supply, - priceless. I would do this as well, how fuckng amazing would it be to watch, It would be like a town of zombies except they wouldn&#039;t be zombies they would be would be a town of fucking trippers who think they have all gone insane. One question though, what about the kids? bedtime drink of water? those nightmares are about to get real. <br /><br />Me too , i dont really have friends anymore, not because im some loner, im a pretty damn sociable guy, it&#039;s just all my friends i had when i was younger turned out to be , i dont know how to put it , wasters . There was a few incidents where shit went missing like cash from my house as well, couldn&#039;t prove who it was as there were a few of us there, I made them all strip to show nobody had it in their boxers, But 2 people had left the house already so they obviously stashed it. <br /><br />looking back now, im glad i sort of abandoned them, The only person you can really trust is yourself, i still have acquaintances,But no friends. THANK FUCK. I honestly like it this way. <br /><br />let&#039;s see something embarrassing..... this one time at band camp. Lol kidding but seriously , a secret would be, I know not to judge a book by it&#039;s cover, learned that lesson a few times. but recently i can just &quot;tell&quot; what people are going to be like before i meet them, By looking at them , the way the act, dress, speak, i usually can get the jist of what a person will be like, and I HATE the majority of people, I hate the fact that everybody is so touch feely these days, remember the days when a cut needed stitches, if you got in a fight it was normal to need a couple stitches, Now it&#039;s serious assault. I hate the fact that all guys wear chinos and think that they need to act cool when they clearly fucking aren&#039;t. Just because they listen to that asshole drake and nicki minaj. how shit is their music? remember when it would have been weird for a guy to get a sunbed or a makeover? I would never do that shit, but guys these days think it&#039;s normal. it&#039;s all going downhill, 20 years from now we will all be a bunch of fucking goons, and &quot;harder&quot; countries will walk all over us. <br /><br />Rant over, good to get that off my chest&nbsp; :P&nbsp; <br />

				Well.. This might be it..<br /><br />If you look at my start date on this forum, thats was the beginning to the road to the end.<br /><br />I came on here looking for quick an easy methods of killing myself.. Mostly because of low self esteem and regret from feeling I have pretty much nothing to look forward too.<br /><br />I found BMR and Atlantis... Looking for to make my death look like a murder.. As I am in a major suit against a company and they bribed my X to have me arrested for some shit that could have landed me in prison.. even the cops were in on it.. DA dropped charges etc.. Kids dont love me, friends distanced themselfs.... X got arrested for it.. But that ruined me and my business to the point of soup kitchen wages..&nbsp; Cant sleep, every door that opens I think there coming to get me.&nbsp; I sit up at night labeled destroyed... <br /><br />So I was looking for cyanide...&nbsp; Enough to poison my milk.. all kinds of stuff.. One day come home drink some and well.. Tap tha fuck out.. Hitler Style, Secret Agent man...<br /><br />Then I got side tracked...&nbsp; Found a few forums where people were looking for items that I had.. So I sold some information..&nbsp; Didnt think it was worth anything, but it was to others... turned Since March ive done things that would land me life in prison made a few thousand... Not drugs or guns though those seem to bring in the $$.&nbsp; I got the tasted of the Tor network, the underground life... <br /><br />So I got side tracked for a few months...&nbsp; Today I ordered it...&nbsp; When I submitted it, but also thought... The end is coming. <br /><br />People try to talk people out of tapping out, but the harsh fact is, when you pretty much have a ruined life no friends and no outlook.. What do tell them.. It will get better?<br /><br />I feel I have server PTSD and cant even see a Dr.... Maybe it is time...<br /><br />Thats how I ended up on here and other forums.. Looking for something to make it look like I was murdered to cover my suicide...<br /><br />

				The compromise between someone relaxing to the extent they reveal a secret to a stranger is that the stranger doesn&#039;t know you so secretly couldn&#039;t care less.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				What an awesome thread!<br /><br />You know the shit thing about getting older, is that in your 20&#039;s, life is an adventure.&nbsp; You try shit just because you can.&nbsp; You have some shit times but generally you flow like water and you just find yourself in situations where you wake up the following morning and go &#039;wtf just happened&#039;.&nbsp; Experiences are many and varied and full of the spirit of adventure.<br /><br />As the years progress, you don&#039;t so much &#039;grow up&#039;, as form a protective barrier around yourself and your capacity for new experience dwindles to the point where all you talk about is real estate and children.&nbsp; Stability is great, but stability to the point where in every social situation you feel completely dead and almost like you&#039;re having an out-of-body experience is not so great.<br /><br />Over the past couple of years, I&#039;ve taken do doing Molly instead of drinking, and doing it by myself if I have a day off just for fun.&nbsp; Molly&#039;s capacity for me at least to find and make connections is outstanding.&nbsp; Even on a small amount, I can &#039;detect&#039; people that are interested in me or are interesting themselves, whereas sober, I flounder and get depressed at my inability to make meaningful connections and just want to go home.&nbsp; It also drops inhibitions in me to the point where my seemedly &#039;outgoing and fun&#039; nature is attractive to other people.&nbsp; In a word: Me on Molly is just a better version of me.<br /><br />My BFF knows I take Molly periodically, but nobody knows the shit I get up to on it.&nbsp; It&#039;s added a level of fun and adventure to my otherwise mundane existence.<br /><br />Honestly, if I had the balls I&#039;d like to campaign for the de-criminalisation of Molly.&nbsp; Molly makes alcohol look incredibly dumb.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the ER rooms at most hospitals on a Saturday night would agree with me....and most of you guys, too.&nbsp; ;D

In fact, he&#039;d probably be thankful it was a friend and not some random clap havin&#039; guy she met at a bar or something.&nbsp; To be honest there is about a 50/50 chance he&#039;d give me a high 5 but its still a conversation I hope to never have.&nbsp;

				LOL, well I have to say, after the first time, I wouldn&#039;t see the harm it the other 10 times..<br /><br />I would be the type to give a high 5, specially after the way you put it.
