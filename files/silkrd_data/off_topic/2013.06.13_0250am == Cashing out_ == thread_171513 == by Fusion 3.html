				Another option you may not have considered is to use those bitcoins to purchase drugs to sell to somebody you know in real life. This only works if you know someone moving quantity and has cash up.

				buy gold coins with btc, exchange them locally at a pawn shop or gold center...&nbsp; of course should likely use a safe drop to ship the gold, and fake information if needed at exchange.

				Just use mit.GOX, that&#039;s the official way to do it in my opinion. Or if you don&#039;t have a bank account you can just buy some cash from SR vendors. The vendor &quot;Gold&quot; seems highly trusted, he sells $100 bills and gold, his fees are pretty large though.

				Buy anonymous cards that are listed here, they mainly come from Polish sellers. Either buy they new and top them up using mt gox or whatever, or buy the more expensive cards which are already topped up for you. Plenty of listings here. Above mention of gold is good too.
