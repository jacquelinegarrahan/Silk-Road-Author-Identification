				Does anyone know how an ALD-52 &quot;Orange Sunshine&quot; vial would look like? I supposedly took 3 hits of ALD-52 at a festival, but it was from a clear eyedropper vial. It didn&#039;t have a chemical taste, but I could taste the alcohol and it also had a mint flavor. The vial might&#039;ve had a very light green tint to it but I couldn&#039;t really tell.<br /><br />The person who sold it to me is my friend and simply sold it as &quot;acid&quot; but he later told me it was ALD-52 which converts into LSD. I say this because he wasn&#039;t trying to upsell it as ALD-52. <br /><br />It definitely felt like LSD but it was much smoother. It didn&#039;t have a body load or any anxious feelings. Pretty sure it wasn&#039;t an NBOMe, but I&#039;m thinking it could be DOx because I was still at a +1 for 24 hours or so. The main trip did end after 8 hours though. I should also note that my other friend took 7 hits of this and he didn&#039;t experience any kind of overdose as you would probably experience from 7 hits of DOC/DOx. I&#039;m kind of convinced that it was actually ALD-52!<br /><br />So basically, the duration and the color of the vial are sketching me out. Either way, best trip of my entire life.
