				Seems like DPR and SR decided to let a top 2% vendor back even tho he admitted to wrong doing and scamming dpr out of his coin...<br /><br />well if a top 2% can set this kind of example I see no reason why anyone should not follow his steps!<br /><br /><br />I now understand how this place works, <br /><br />its ok <br /><br />I will plan accordingly.<br /><br />

				yes fuck you.. its ok bro.. dpr said it with his actions.. if you have a client who wants to do business but its so much business that you cant take btc that its ok to deal with other ways of payment that cut dpr out of here...<br /><br />makes sense to me..<br /><br />lol.. 2100$ pounds for everyone!!! :)<br /><br /><br />its no wonder the site went down for 3 days....&nbsp; dpr had no cash to take care of it because if he did he surely would back up his rules and would have kicked out mrouid.. but no,,.,<br /><br />he needs mrouid and his money.. that is sad... SR is only as big as a good vendor on here!! <br /><br /><br />lmao!!<br /><br /><br />
