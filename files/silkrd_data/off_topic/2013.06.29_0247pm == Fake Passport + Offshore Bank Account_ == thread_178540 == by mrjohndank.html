				Eventually, I would like to open an offshore account, but obviously I don&#039;t want to use my real passport or have to wait for a second one. Now I was wonder if a Hong Kong account linked with some other country&#039;s passport (NZ, Canada, Australia, etc.) would be a good idea to hide some money. And since HK is a money clearing center for dollar in the region, thus it would not leave a paper trail. So good idea opening with a fake passport, or will they check it with the authorities?

				If you mind me asking do you already have a fake passport? and if so where from and how much? <br /><br />I have found them online but they have been for £5000 plus for UK passports.

I have seen that too , I don&#039;t have a fake, but I do have a real one :D&nbsp; ( no I am not selling it) . I would suggest getting a fake passport for another country, that way, you will not be in as much shit if, let&#039;s say Russia, hears you were screwing with their passports.&nbsp; Also, if you are interested, I heard there was a torrent on hackbb with all sorts of goodies, but i had to delete it because I thought I might be in deep shit over something, so I had to delete it all :( .&nbsp; I&nbsp; will PM you if I find it :D .
