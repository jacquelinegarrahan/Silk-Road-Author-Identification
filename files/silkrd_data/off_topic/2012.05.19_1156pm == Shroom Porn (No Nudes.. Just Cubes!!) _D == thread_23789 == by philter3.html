(this is still the early stages of the harvest.. things haven&#039;t really started&nbsp; kicking yet volume wise) .. note how lovely they look before drying.. picked JUST before the veil breaks.. for optimal magic.. and bulbous groovy-ness...)<br /><br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=54087acd30fd964ee89a2594037e5172.jpg

				Hahaha, the title made me laugh. You grew those? Beautiful.<br /><br />Are those B+? Do you use cakes or a casing? I was able to successfully grow some cakes earlier this year. It was my first grow, so I kind of fucked up the second flush, didn&#039;t get a third at all... How much grow area do you use? I&#039;ll be in a different house starting August and I am definitely going to grow again, but I&#039;d like to try my hand at some big casing boxes. I&#039;ll just be limited to my closet space :/ hopefully I can maximize it. I&#039;ll also be investing more money in equipment and I&#039;ll probably get my spores from here instead of a general supplier. My B+ cakes all spawned but I ordered a GT syringe and the cakes never fucking fruited! I was pissed. I did everything correct, so methinks I just had some crap spores.<br /><br />But seriously, those look great, perhaps you could share some growing tips when I start up again?

				I actually use a hybrid liquid culture based method with cakes as a starter substrate, then shred them to expand to bulk with other components. And it&#039;s poo-free (cause my woman doesn&#039;t like horseshit in her kitchen!).<br /><br />You might describe it as a &quot;Brute Force Lab Rat Bulking Method based loosely on PF Tek&quot;. 10+ years in the making. :D<br /><br />These are all Amazonia strain. I do not use B+ myself (though I have in the past) because it has this annoying habit of going wonk on potency when you cycle it through multiple generations of liquid culture (just my experience.. ).<br /><br />I&#039;m always happy to help with advice. But the best advice I can give anyone is &quot;GROW YOUR OWN!&quot; <br /><br />I will toss up pictures of what a pound or two looks like.. lots of folks haven&#039;t ever seen that in all it&#039;s glory.<br /><br />&nbsp;I confess.. I like to trip and just watch them. Sitting there. Crazy? Well yes. I&#039;m cool with that though.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ooh that sounds knowledgeable! And fun! haha. I&#039;ve only done a few grows myself. Haha 10+ years ago I was very young, I&#039;m currently a university student. For beginners would you suggest giving a casing a shot? I just thought it looks like they tend to yield a bit more than cakes. Also I was thinking of trying out Ecuadorians with the casing. Good idea or strain doesn&#039;t matter too much? I won&#039;t be trying to grow any ones that require more advanced methods anytime soon...

				Something really simple you can try.<br /><br />Do your usual PF Tek style 1/2 pint jar grow. When they are fully colonized and you&#039;ve got COMPLETE colonization on all the jars and pinning on 1/4-1/3 of them.. get yourself a clear plastic tub (about 16 liters or so) from the Dollar Store.<br /><br />Spray paint the bottom and the lower 4 inches of the sides with flat black enamel spray paint. Do this to the OUTSIDE btw.<br /><br />Take a metal cheese grater. Birth the cakes, and shred them like they are hunks of cheese with the grater into the tub. Level the surface nice and even.<br /><br />Mist and cover. Remist gently every few days. You can also pasturize some vermiculite to lay over top as a simple casing layer if you like.<br /><br />Wait. Watch. Enjoy. Yields are higher than a terrarium classic PF style and much more covert for closet use. This will allow you to gently work up to more intricate casing methods.<br /><br />

Do you drill air holes in the tub you put them in? And are you putting down verm on the bottom then grating the cakes on top? I was just going to get a few cakes once they&#039;re completely colonized after about a week, and place them on moist verm but I&#039;m liking your idea. <br /><br />Oh and what did you mean by the term &quot;pinning&quot;? Just haven&#039;t come across it before, cheers for all the tips!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Air holes are not really necessary with small grows like this little tub setup. You are going to be opening it up every day or two to mist anyway. That&#039;s plenty of air exchange. All those factors about CO2 and pin-setting are way more complicated than you need to worry about with this little dealie. They ARE important in larger more sophisticated setups though.. I&#039;m not dismissing them for that though.<br /><br />You can put down verm on the bottom if you like. It will add some moisture retention qualities to your substrate. You can even layer verm, shreds, verm, shreds if you are feeling froggy. This is what I meant by the shredded cakes being a good gentle entryway into more sophisticated bulking/casing methods. You can ease into it.<br /><br />There is no point in keeping the cakes whole.. distribute their total area by shredding instead of leaving them intact. Fruiting body mass and volume is a function of both substrate mass and substrate surface area. By shredding the mass stays the same, but the surface area increases dramatically. <br /><br />Pinning is when you start to see the little bitty pre-shroom bodies forming.. like little worms, or dots on the surface of the cakes or your substrate. Pins become new fruiting bodies basically. <br /><br />Way cool so many people are growing their own. THIS IS THE WAY!!!<br /><br />Follow the Will of the Party Comrades!!! Seize the Means of Psilocybin Production!!

				Nice mucks man I just started growing some PES Hawaiian today myself for the first time :D.<br />I have a few questions if you don&#039;t mind.<br /><br />1. Will BRF&nbsp; work with your method or should I use rye seed?<br /><br />2. Should I use distilled water or regular tap water?<br /><br />3.
