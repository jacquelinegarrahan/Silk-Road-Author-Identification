				I was wondering if sourcing is allowed. I see people looking for RCs, synthetic weed blends, benzos, gbl, somas etc.. and know of a bunch of great sources outside of SR. I am not trying to divert business from this website but when I see people charging outrageous prices for benzos or people looking for substances that are not listed on SR I would be glad to tell them where they can find what they are looking for; as long as it is not against the rules.

				if you have access to them at a good price and there is a demand here, why don&#039;t you sell them here.

				Well for starters I am not really trying to become a dealer. I just want to help people find what they are looking for - fighting the good fight so to speak.<br /><br />Not to bash on sellers or anything, but seeing someone sell 1mg xanax for $3 each when it can easily be found for $0.70 each makes me want to tell people where they can find a good deal.

I love the way the Silk Road is run and it has become a great source for me. That being said, there are plenty of other good sources out there that are no shiftier than SR. Places that I have used for years which offer great deals and are quite professional. All I am asking is whether or not it is okay to share these sources. I am not trying to convince anyone to use them or take their business elsewhere, just help people find what they are looking for.<br /><br />There are also websites such as SoS that allow people to give ratings and feedback about other sources.

				Hmmm.&nbsp; Putting someone out of business should not be anyone&#039;s concern aside from the seller that is vunerable.&nbsp; It&#039;s evolution.&nbsp; Adapt or die - but he wont.<br /><br />There is a reason buyers are here.&nbsp; Either through inexperience or the escrow system or the 1% that are vets that are forum junkies. <br /><br />He should know the answer to the question though.&nbsp; Ofc you can&#039;t dummy.<br /><br />That being said PM me them.&nbsp; J/k.

If someone is selling items at an uncompetitive price perhaps they should be put out of business or make their prices more competitive. That is capitalism and I fully support it. <br /><br />I am not trying to be &quot;noble.&quot; I am a fellow user that shops around for a good deal and would like others to be able to do the same. Shit, try telling someone you sell to that it wouldn&#039;t be fair of them to buy their drugs elsewhere as it would hurt your business, see how that works out for you.<br /><br />Also, I had no intention of posting a list of reputable vendors - if anything that would put them more on the radar as this is quite likely being monitored. I know a few people who were posing in the &quot;Product Request&quot; forum and was thinking of going ahead and messaging them where they can find what they are looking for. I wasn&#039;t sure if that was allowed so I created this thread to find out what SRs stance is on sourcing.

				The quickest way to solve Fred&#039;s concern is just to get more sellers on SR marketplace as fast as possible.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already suggested to a couple of my closer ones that they do it.&nbsp; They need schooled in BTC and Tor but they are good, reliable AND reasonably priced sellers.<br /><br />But LTTM is also right.&nbsp; SWIM has sold online before and there is a HUGE difference in quality, especially in benzos between what is manufactured at a licensed OEM plant in the US or EU and sometimes even India (in the case of Roche) is fine.&nbsp; BUT...and this is a big but, the ones you see these days that are sub $1.00 are all the Pakistani crap.&nbsp; You can buy it in bulk for about $0.07 if you know the right guy.&nbsp; Considering what good ones cost, the cheaper guy is actually making the biggest profit.&nbsp; Some of the bad ones have a much reduced dose of the active ingredient (Onax 2mg alprazolam are usually about 0.5 when tested.&nbsp; A lot of the others and all of the bulk diazepam are just inert ingredients, no active at all).&nbsp; <br /><br />Why do you think Onax makes it&#039;s &quot;2mg xanax&quot; in a bar with 4 sections anyway?&nbsp; To copy the Gadors; which are best on the market.<br />You haven&#039;t seen those on SR, have you?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because every one gets sold at a nice price elsewhere.<br />(disclaimer: I know of two people, not the same as above, who are going to start selling Gadors soon on SR, so you *will* see some)<br /><br />A good diazepam generic, like Roche, Auperin, Mylan costs A LOT more today than it did 5 years ago.&nbsp; Basically double.&nbsp; <br /><br />The so-called bars made by Onax and all the other nonsense sold on the pharmacy boards and bodybuilding boards is total junk.&nbsp; I say that with all certainty and sincerity.&nbsp; And on a forum such as SR, where a buyer can ding you off the front page with a bad review, no one can take that chance; nor should they.<br /><br />The cheapest guy on the board with good product is peaceandlove.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t mind shipment from the UK, that&#039;s your low price guy.<br />If you need US-&gt;US shipping, you will pay more.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also agree the buyers are here because of the escrow and vendor communications.&nbsp; When they get 100pc of fake diazepam, will the seller get paid?&nbsp; I think not...<br /><br />Besides, the money given to Pakistan just goes to blow up others of our citizens.&nbsp; You don&#039;t really want your drug dollar going to blow up your countrymen, do you? :)

				^ Haha okay you make a solid point. But again, I am not arguing the merits of using overseas sources vs local sources, I&#039;m just wondering if sourcing is allowed.<br /><br />Besides, it is easy to find Roche brand 1mg xanax for $0.70 that are indeed 1mg - I&#039;m not referring to the bulk valium and sketchy manufacturers (like Onax) or anything. There are plenty of good sources out there.<br /><br />&quot;A good diazepam generic, like Roche, Auperin, Mylan costs A LOT more today than it did 5 years ago.&nbsp; Basically double.&quot;<br />If you are talking about made in the United States then yes, that is true. Roche pakistan makes good (and inexpensive) benzos that will pass a blind taste test any day, and they are waaaayyyy cheaper.&nbsp; <br /><br />RCs are fairly scarce when it comes to variety and bulk on SR. There are a bunch of reputable vendors out there.
