				I took a look around to see if there was a spot for newbie&#039;s to introduce themselves but didn&#039;t see anything so I figured I&#039;d start here in the &quot;off topic&quot; section and if anyone has any suggestions or advice, throw it at me:)<br /><br />Anyways, wanted to take a moment out and firstly thank all of you who have taken the time and effort with not only providing such wonderful tips and advice but being such a great community overall. I&#039;ve been around on SR for a few months now but am just now starting to understand how it all works and will be placing my first order today! :)&nbsp; Cannot thank you all enough who have put in the time with how to guides, etc because without them, I think we&#039;d still be quite confused....lol&nbsp; &nbsp;because talk about &quot;deep web&quot;...phew, this is a mental workout! haha<br /><br />I&#039;m excited to be a part of the community now and finally being official on the forums so HEY to everyone!!!<br /><br />Looking forward to talking with you all and helping in any way I can in the future with contributing any help, etc I can to SR. <br /><br />Much love and kudos to all who have done such an amazing job and to the amazing sellers I&#039;m looking forward to doing business with!
