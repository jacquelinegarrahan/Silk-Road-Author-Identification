				Would you support violence against law enforcement, or would you still say they are just doing their jobs and don&#039;t deserve to die?<br /><br />also, check out these pictures<br /><br />http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2069844/Chinese-execution-pictures-Women-executed-drug-smuggling.html<br /><br />I love the comments the most<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">These people knew the penalty if they were caught. This holds true for any crime no matter how silly or unfair the laws may be. So &quot;Don&#039;t Do the Crime if You Can&#039;t Do the Time&quot; or in this case &quot;Don&#039;t do the Crime and get caught and shot in the Head U Dope!<br /><br />- Eric The Barbaric, Detroit, USA, 06/12/2011 02:25</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />These are the people we are up against in USA. I think we should start killing them before they kill us. Is there much difference between spending a lifetime in prison versus being killed? I bet enelysion wishes they would execute him. <br /><br />I can&#039;t wait until we make it illegal to do some harmless thing that Eric does with a death penalty. I really hope I live to see the day the tables are turned on these fuckers. I don&#039;t even want the war on drugs to end peacefully, I want the people who support it to be fucking gassed. Of course we need to pass a law saying they can be executed for supporting the war on drugs first, I wonder how fast their &quot;The law is the law&quot; attitude will change. Fucking stupid brainless zombies are not even living beings now.

				Haha, I already support violence against law enforcement! Not necessarily willy-nilly, but if they want to be tyrannical with the people they&#039;re supposed to serve, well... &quot;don&#039;t do the crime if you can&#039;t do the time&quot; or in this case &quot;don&#039;t abuse your power and get caught and shot in the head u dope!&quot;<br /><br />Sucks, y&#039;know. I know some good cops. They actually do exist, but I&#039;d put them in the pitifully small minority. For the most part, cops are just ignorant boneheads. A US federal court recently ruled that a police department could discriminate against LEO applicants with high IQ scores, citing that high IQs correlated to poor retention rates. Thems the facts. Cops are an overwhelmingly ignorant bunch, licensed for the savagery they no doubt desire. Makes the state a lot of money, keeps the darkies and other such riff raff in line.<br /><br />American government (most government, for that matter), at all levels, is basically an organized crime racket. They provide shitty services and we have no choice but to accept and overpay. Tough break. And I&#039;m not even a fucking libertarian. That&#039;s the saddest part of all.<br /><br />In closing, fuck the police.
