				Some have suggested that it could be a proxy, like a hidden service version of onion.to. While that&#039;s possible, one indicator would be that accessing the site takes twice as long. Hidden service access times can be quite variable, but I haven&#039;t experienced a noticeable delay in accessing the phishing site.<br /><br />Plus, that would make it the most sophisticated phishing site we&#039;ve seen. Once phishers get your user/pass/pin, they don&#039;t care anymore. Usually they throw up an error page. Why would someone create such a sophisticated phishing site for mostly useless Atlantis accounts? Why spam it here where the vast majority of people don&#039;t have Atlantis accounts?<br /><br />In my mind, there&#039;s a 95% chance it is run by the Atlantis admins, and a 5% chance it&#039;s a proxy.

				Doesn&#039;t surprise me at all. I have noticed as of late that their employed marketing expert has been creating ridiculous threads on Silk Road trying to spread FUD about Silk Road, I just think thats low and disrespectful to the entire community here.

				Sometimes, instead of saying, &quot;it couldn&#039;t possibly be&quot; and risking your livelihood when, &quot;its so obvious, nobody would fall for that trap.&quot; You&#039;ll realize that the trap was for you all along. <br /><br />I do my best not to dismiss what I don&#039;t understand; would you care to join me? <br /><br /><br />Take this here spade. I&#039;m certain its a spade. It lifts dirt from the earth and leaves it where I so choose. I could call it wooden plank with some cheap recycled iron, but together, those unremarkable things make the spade a spade. <br /><br />Atlantis cannot possibly exist for the benefit of is buyers and sellers. Much of their expenses are arbitrary, and although their costs are lower, the proportions are as such that Atlantis needs more buyers and sellers and transactions than the silk road currently possesses to maintain a similar profit margin. They are not solvent, and considering historical circumstances, may never become so.

				Another thing is, the last Atlantis spammer wasn&#039;t an obvious shill account. They had 175 posts and all of them were normal posts until the spam started.

The fact that those idiots are even focusing on something like that instead of putting all their efforts into marketing their website to the general public (increasing the number of buyers) just speaks to their level of intelligence. And it really emphasizes the fact that they&#039;ll never be in competition with SR.

				BTW, I would never use Atlantis anyway, based on the admins&#039; flagrant disregard for their customers&#039; security. Besides the in-browser PGP thing, they have repeatedly posted onion.to links to their site on clearnet. If the phishing site is a proxy that can MITM your connection and steal your account credentials, than the *official* approved method of accessing their site is the same thing, posted by the admins on sites like reddit.

BMR also has optional auto-encryption, just like Atlantis. I have never heard anyone say that BMR is putting users at risk. The odd thing is that Atlantis clearly has better systems in place than SR - 100% uptime, no image hacks, no database deterioration that necessitates weeks of downtime, etc. <br /><br />I have around $70K spent at SR, $7K spent at Atlantis. When I first started making purchases on Atlantis, the other posters here on SRF earnestly informed me that Atlantis is an LE honeypot, and using the site would result in my arrest. Obviously that hasn&#039;t happened. Next was the claim that my coins that I kept in Atlantis would be stolen by the admins. That didn&#039;t happen either. <br /><br />From reading the Atlantis forums my sense is that the admins there are very above board. I would be very, very surprised if they would change their commission structure without informing vendors in advance. You can get an account there for around $35, and if you are a scammer you will last about 5 minutes once you try to start the scam, and will be banned. Their feedback system is solid, and reveal the existence of scamming and padded feedback instantly. <br /><br />What I am getting at is that the user experience is a lot better on Atlantis. All it needs now is more vendors selling the specific products that I like and I will definitely spend more money there. The fact that I am a lot less likely to be scammed on Atlantis than on Silk Road is my primary concern.<br /><br />I am not interested in people saying that I am disloyal. I make no claims on DPR, his time, or his money. I am sure he makes no claims on me, my time, or my money. I am a free person.

				Nice way to limit the response. This isn&#039;t just about you.<br /><br />As I wrote before, the admins have posted onion.to links to their site on clearnet.<br /><br />If the phishing site is a proxy that MITMs connections to steal account credentials, then an *official* approved method of accessing the site, promoted by the admins themselves, opens their users to the exact same threat. You never know when onion.to or onion.sh might start doing that.<br /><br />That is a flagrant disregard for their users&#039; security. That combined with the in-browser PGP feature breeds laziness and insecurity among their users.

				By running commercials, spamming reddit, and through other feeble mainstream marketing techniques, Atlantis in my opinion has brought/is bringing unwanted attention to the entire scene, as well as attracting the lowest common denominator of customers (noobs) to the various marketplaces and the darknet in general. <br /><br />So IMHO, they can go fuck themselves just from a lack of tact and common sense and are jeopardizing the security of EVERYONE who uses various mediums (IOPS, SR, BMR) to buy narcotics. <br /><br />So there&#039;s your jeopardy.

				Perhaps finding a way to shut down the /r/silkroad subreddit (forcefully if necessary) and limiting media exposure would also reduce the number of &quot;noobs&quot; and immature kids flooding the darknet looking to get blown...<br /><br />I have a feeling it would.<br /><br />Also, as a side note: <br />Having journalists, even ones who describe and promote the positive, educating, and choice-allowing nature of SR, should be limited if not discouraged from participating on this site.

The public&#039;s (and more importantly, LE&#039;s) image of SR as a virtualized back alleyway full of insidious individuals is set in stone. It will not be changed

				I actually think that someone in Atlantis (maybe the admins themselves, but I have no proof of this) create accounts with well known user names here is SR.<br /><br />I tried to make a search on my name in Atlantis and guess what? It&#039;s there! With MY PGP to booth! Somebody obviously created an account there with my personal PGP but to what end? They cannot naturally un-encrypt messages with that key, so what&#039;s the point?<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s the deal but I suggest everybody to check for their user names here in SR in Atlantis. I can bet how much you want that in the majority of cases you will be already there. It&#039;s really possible that a normal buyer scammer would use your account with YOUR PGP? What would be the point? I would understand that if they used a well known account here with THEIR OWN PGP, but with the true one?<br /><br />But maybe someone with a little more experience in these things can make me understand what would be the point of doing something like that, if not just to have an account with my name there (something that the Admins would be more interested in than a normal buyer).

Atlantis has been on an aggressive marketing campaign for some time now, and it&#039;s clear they want to steal SR users. They tried creating forum accounts and advertising here, but those accounts and posts were deleted. They tried drawing vendors to their market by waiving the vendor fee and 3 months of commission. They tried luring more vendors with these &quot;buyer&quot; shills with gift codes. They created an AMA on on the Silk Road subreddit, for Christ&#039;s sake. Is it really hard to believe they would engage in underhanded tactics to steal SR users?<br /><br />Do you believe those were real buyers with gift codes?

If anything, they are trying too hard to act like they don&#039;t care about their importance relative to SR while at the same time listing a bunch of marketing ploys on their login page.<br /><br />They also take Litecoin though, which if SR started taking there would probably cease to be an Atlantis

				Astro , If you have any questions about Atlantis marketing tactics you may direct them to me since I took over that role with the launch of our YT video.<br />Pm spamming links to SR users is frankly ineffective when I consider all the methods I have at my disposal and not something I would ever take this job to be a part of. <br />I also mod the Atlantis forum and I even registered here with the same name just so there would be no ambiguity about who I am. <br /><br />I believe our cheaper rates and better feedback system is enough and in time I think every good vendor will list on both sites, In my mind and how I plan things is that we will now independently attract our own audience and SR will also have it&#039;s own with most vendors listing on both sites.<br /><br />I have refrained from posting directly about Atlantis on the SR forums as I honestly tried but cant figure out where users here stand with regard to us, we are wrong if we try to advertise how we are better to SR users and we are wrong if we decide to target clearweb users. Perhaps we should just sit back and admire our pretty site and hope people see it shine from afar&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I also didn&#039;t take this role to try and prove or disprove conspiracy theory&#039;s when in reality we are all just wasting our time discussing when we could be suggesting solutions,All I know about the matter is I informed SR mods about the phlishing site on July 10 while I was stuck in the newbie forum on multiple occasions and nothing was done bar removing the threads. It would have been much easier to just add the url to the profanity blacklist and not delete threads every time I posted &quot;scam ^^^^^ Don&#039;t click&quot; and reported it. <br />Any mod worth their salt would have done that immediately instead of wasting their own time..Unless they thought I would just eventually leave it alone and move on out of the newbie section but lets not start throwing rumors around since my posts calling out the scam have now been deleted with the offending threads but SR mods are free to check the bin for them if they think I&#039;m lying.<br /><br />I have already suggested the homepage be changed in such a way (if possible)to render this phishing obsolete.&nbsp; If you have any input of suggestion on this I will only be too happy to take it upstairs.<br />I also commend the SR mods for finally removing all trace of the offending links. <br /><br />And like that, I made my contribution and you guys are free to get on with things here.<br /><br />Have a nice day :) <br /><br />H2.0<br />

				kill em with kindness H2.0<br /><br />nobody in the right mind using Atlantis thinks it is as wide-reaching or successful as Silk Road at the moment. <br /><br />nobody in the right mind would solely use Atlantis and not Silk Road<br /><br />can&#039;t say the same about vice versa, which is understandable. <br /><br />life and everything that goes with it is about balance, have you found yours yet?

				Just so everybody is aware of how we are trying to nip this in the bud and be pro-active about this.<br />I have been keeping an eye on the newbie forum and other places where scammers thrive.<br /><br />Apparently a buyer has now posted the link in a vendor feedback post<br />&quot;5 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; Biggest Competition to Silk Road: http://[CENSORED: scam link].onion/&nbsp; &nbsp; 49 minutes &quot;<br /><br />I have asked the person reporting it to let me know the url of the listing so that SR mods can be informed who posted it and ban the&nbsp; buyer account.<br />If they have made purchases before then It may be possible to further narrow down who is behind this particular post.<br />Here is the link to the thread where it was reported http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186313.msg1348923#msg1348923<br /><br />I have now saved the URL and informed mods to add it to the profanity/blacklist of terms so it cannot be posted on the forum again. (Hopefully you can so this site-wide)<br />so now the scam&nbsp; url ( http://[CENSORED: scam link].onion/&nbsp; ) should soon be replaced with some ( other text that is not scam link ) everywhere it appears if the mods here are efficient enough.<br /><br />If the scammers get a new url I would encourage anyone else to report this in the same way, If we make their lives hard and expensive enough to operate they will go away.<br />We have also added a not on out login page to check the url in the address bar is correct so hopefully it encourages users to be more aware of these scams. <br /><br />I have contacted libertas to engage with me on the matter and hopefully we can find out who the buyer account belonged to. <br /><br />*****EDIT*****Here is the listing with the phishing link, http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/1422ef17de <br /><br />Whoever is behind it likes their coke&nbsp; ;D, Hopefully there will be a real investigation into this and findings can be posted here publicly. <br /><br />

				Heya, astor.<br /><br />Just wonderin&#039; how that tin foil hat is working out for you. In case you haven&#039;t noticed there are a lot of SR users and vendors, and new Atlantis users that having their money stolen through this phishing scam. Instead of alerting people to the dangers of this scam and asking the mods to take action against it, you instead suggested that it wasn&#039;t a phishing scam at all, just an Atlantis marketing ploy. You did so against all the evidence and all the logic to the contrary. Someone might question your motives in doing that. Yeah, your tin foil hat can be worn that way too.<br /><br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve read a bunch of threads and replies today about newbs (and not such newbs) losing access to SR due to the Atlantis phishing scam, but I didn&#039;t read of anyone losing coin. Many of the users wrote something like &quot;lucky I didn&#039;t use the same pin&quot; but from what Astor is saying they didn&#039;t have the opportunity to give their pin? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty weird phishing scam that just wants to lock people out of their accounts, souring them on SR, but not taking their money, which may sour them on the whole online black market phenomena, AB.

				Ok, so I skimmed through the first 10 pages of the Newbie forum and found these two threads:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186311.0<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=186313.0<br /><br />where it looks like 2 people have been phished by that site, and I&#039;d say the better evidence is that the phisher finalized their orders and put the spam in their feedback.<br />

				I got this today in my Atlantis inbox. From what I can see on the Atlantis forum, people register at Atlantis through the phishing proxy, deposit funds, and then the funds are withdrawn. Any SR passwords and PINs gained are just a bonus.<br /><br />[WARNING]: Phishing attack launched against Atlantis users<br /><br />Hi All,<br /><br />We have identified a phishing attempt launched against Atlantis users and have taken various precautions to eliminate its impact.<br /><br />Please be sure that you use [CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion when ever you connect to Atlantis and you will experience no issues.<br /><br />If you use a Tor proxy relay service or were linked here from a third party site, please update your password and security code immediately.<br /><br />For vendors, we have made it compulsory to specify your security code when enabling or making changes to the automatic withdrawal system.<br /><br />We will be launching an investigation into where the funds are being routed to and will announce our discoveries on the forum.<br /><br />As always, support is here to help you in case you have any questions.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />The Atlantis Team.

When you go to the phising site they proxy the real site so you ARE talking to the real site, it is just that the proxy can read and tamper.<br /><br />It does not mean it is bein ran by the same admin. It is not evidence of anything at all other than the phishers are using one of the simplest methods to phis a site. This is not sophisticated, this is script kiddie stuff. You just download a tool, fill in a config file and launch it.<br /><br />Such a proxy would not need to take twice as long as it would be keeping a well established circuit to the hidden service at all times. Once you make the initial connection to a hidden services further ones are faster meaning a proxy serving only one hidden service will not take twice as long.<br /><br />The time and version are the same because you are talking to the real server through the fake one. One must be very careful examining evidence to make sure it actually proves what you think it proves.
