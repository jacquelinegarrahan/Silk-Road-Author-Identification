				Dollars or transaction wise? I know there are some vendors who only sell in bulk but make a shit ton of money while there are others who do smaller transactions but A LOT of them.<br /><br />I know MIMM used to be one of the top vendors, hell I would reload his damn vendor page after a few minutes and it would show like 3 or 4 people FEing. Guy must of had a warehouse full of product ::). I had a couple issues with him though so I&#039;m never ordering from him again.<br /><br />In terms of vendors I have personally ordered from I think Heisenberg is doing pretty good, HollandOnline sells a shit ton of stuff too.

Anyone got a reputable source explaining how the ranking is computed?<br /><br /><br />The highest rank I have seen was a heroin dealer in the top %2, I think.
