				Not sure how many people are going to agree with me on this one.&nbsp; But, i will give my case.<br />When I saw iron man without watching any trailers I absolutely loved the movie.<br />When word got under way about Iron man 2 my being over excited got the better of me.<br />I decided to watch three to four varying trailers on Youtube.<br />BIG mistake.&nbsp; When the dvd finally arrived I had already seen literally 90 per cent of the movie.<br />I was even pissed that a scene from the trailer got cut from the main feature.<br />If there are any of you out there who can share this point of view, please feel free to share.

				Comedies are the worst, 90% of the comedies coming out now days are shit anyways and they put the 3 or 4 actual funny moments of the entire movie in the trailers. I think the last movie I saw that truly made me laugh was 50/50, Seth Rogan&#039;s best movie IMO.

				I love them for that very reason. I can go to apple.com/trailers and feel like I&#039;ve watched 15 different movies. Saves a lot of time

				I like to avoid watching trailers and descriptions before most movies, since they can make the movie less suspenseful and exciting.&nbsp; <br /><br />Disclaimer:I&#039;m not trying to argue or insult but I found both Iron Man movies to be shitty.&nbsp; <br /><br />On another note, the second one was especially horrible, even infantile.&nbsp; It&#039;s just another formulaic set of explosions and CGI effects to cater to the violence-obsessed teens and young adults.&nbsp; There&#039;s no substance.&nbsp; Just explosions.<br /><br />Maybe blockbusters just aren&#039;t my style of movie.

				The Dictators trailer was hilarious....<br /><br />But it gave away the punch line to about half of the funniest jokes..<br /><br />Double edged sword, get people excited blow a few jokes or no one turns up because they havent heard about it...<br /><br />Def an art to trailers.... So many fail at this art....

				I&#039;ve always liked the very short trailers like the ones they did for district 9. Gives you a hint of what is going on which is good enough for me.
