				Anyone know of an online doctor that can write a script for a controlled substance? Please PM with info.&nbsp; Really appreciate it.

				Any prescription not made by a doctor in a face to face meeting is technically invalid in the US. Some IOPs will include a &quot;prescription&quot;, which is just a piece of paper with a photocopied doctor&#039;s signature. Sorry but there is no such thing

				I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s exactly what you&#039;re looking for but airmailchemists.com ships from the UK. They make you a legitimate script that from what I&#039;ve come to understand is acceptable in the United States.&nbsp; Kinda pricey though, you&#039;re looking at $100 for 65 .5mg xanax. I know several people who place orders on a monthly basis and have never (with the exception of one long wait in customs) taken more than a week to arrive.

				What&#039;s fucked up is I was referring to AMC in my post. That prescription they give you is bullshit. It&#039;s not valid in the US by any means. It&#039;s a receipt with a photocopied name at the bottom. That site sucks balls. The Airmail Group has expensive prices on everything but benzos and most of their generics are near expiry date and are low quality.

				Thank you and noted.<br /><br />Prices are way too high anyway. I&#039;m just surrounded by a group of attorneys who swear by it and maintain that it would hold up if brought to court (not that you would want to ever get to that point in the first place). <br /><br />On top of that, I&#039;ve read that AMC has the tendency to over charge your credit card. Kinda shitty, but like I said it worked well over 20 times for my buddies.

				That prescription is not from a face-to-face doctor consultation performed in the US. The prescription is offered due to prescription laws in the UK, and the order is signed by a doctor in Panama. There is a small chance you could get off in court with the if you have a 90 day prescription, but you can easily be prosecuted under some act that I can&#039;t recall.

				I&#039;m sure you&#039;re right. I&#039;m assuming these slick ass attorneys believe they would be able to convince the LE that they were legit scripts.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been pondering using them for a couple weeks now but after I just got a fresh delivery from Oliver I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever need to visit AMC ever again!&nbsp; 8)

				The only thing AMC is good for in my opinion is Klonopin, that is if you don&#039;t mind waiting three weeks and buy in bulk to offset shipping. Your package will arrive, and they come in awesome little brown bottles. The script they give you for 300 is the same as 100 and I don&#039;t see the whole, &quot;I take 6-8mg of Klonopin a day&quot; trick working for personal use. <br /><br />The concept of that piece of printer paper with that photocopied doctor&#039;s name from Panama being a legitimate prescription is insanity. Just misinformation to set their customer&#039;s mind at ease and charge more money.
