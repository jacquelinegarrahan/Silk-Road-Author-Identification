				I&#039;d bring the various RCs/psys/edibles/bomb ass dank/etc. of my preference, and go back to a few months before the invention of the bitcoin so I could sell and work to save up dough for a shit ton of bitcoins, meaning I&#039;d stay past the 3 day limit and just chill. It wasn&#039;t that long ago, and it would be cool to have extra time to get my shit together. I&#039;d be rolling in the dough if I bought and saved enough BTC too.<br /><br />I know I could go to the 60&#039;s or whatever, but that just seems like an opportunity-less experience. No chance to further myself.

				I would definitely go six or seven hundred years into the future. For one I would get a history of lottery drawing numbers and make sure to hit a big jackpot when I got back, so I would be very rich if I returned. It might be hard to track down this information quickly, but if there is still an internet it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to look up within such a timespan. Actually I would first put someone here in charge of maintaining a website that keeps track of lottery numbers, and then since when I get back I will be a billionare after winning two massive jackpots, I could use some of the interest from that to create a foundation that archives lottery numbers and other tidbits of information that I may find advantageous to know, so that I can record them in the future and bring them back with me.&nbsp; Additionally, it is probable that in six or seven hundred years the state of medicine and technology in general will be extraordinarily advanced, if pseudo immortality has been achieved I would probably stay. At least I would bring back as much information with me as I could in an attempt to advance the present day to futuristic standards.&nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t care exactly how many years into the future I would go, but roughly 1000, maybe 10 000 wouldn&#039;t hurt to be on the safe side. By then technology should allow me to travel through space-time in a man-built spacecraft. I would visit some other civilization(s) on some distant planet(s). So cool.&nbsp; 8)
