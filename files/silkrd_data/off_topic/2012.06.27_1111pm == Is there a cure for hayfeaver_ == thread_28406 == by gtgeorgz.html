				Anything?! maybe theres a drug on sr that will help me? maybe a home remedy anyone would like to share that helps?<br />i&#039;m pretty desperate. I&#039;ve been prescribed all sorts of medication, although some it does help a little, its never cured me or took away the symptoms comfortably.<br /><br />For those who dont know what hayfeaver is like (in the UK anyway) its like having a cold for the whole of the summer, apart from instead of clogged nose, its all runny and feels like you&#039;ve been snorting pepper. I also get a tight chest, shortness of breath, cough and itchy eyes.<br />

				The only decent cures have the side effect of making you very sleepy. Antihistamines that are &#039;non drowsy&#039; are bullshit and don&#039;t work. I can point you in the direction of some potent hayfever meds which you can buy legally (even from Amazon) but they make me more sleepy than Ketamine.<br /><br />One trick I&#039;ve heard which may work, depending what is causing your hayfever (as you know the spores entering your body can be through your nose, eyes, mouth, skin etc), is to put Vaseline at the entrance to your nose, around and up each hole. This sounds silly but apparently it catches loads of the the spores and drastically reduces the hayfever effects.

				a k-hole should cure it, not sure it that&#039;s practical for you?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using promethazine and its working well, its a sedative antihistamine tho. Its is annoying when you don&#039;t want to feel sedated. Normal antihistamines do fuck all for me. I hear that using local honey can help, I see the logic in that but i&#039;ve never tried it. <br /><br />Some clearnet links for local honey:<br /><br />USA http://www.honeylocator.com/locator/find/<br />UK http://www.beedata.com/localhoney/cgi-bin/webdata_honey.pl?cgifunction=user

				Hi,<br /><br />I have been suffering from allergy to certain plants in spring for 26 years, it got to the point of asthmatic attacs.<br />The older Antihistamines did work in some way, but made me extremely tired, and you had to take them approximately<br />two weeks before the full effect was reached.<br /><br />Nowadays I use Loratadin which is working wonders, absolutely no tiredness and almost instant relieve.<br />They don&#039;t &quot;heal&quot; you, but I am almost free of all symptoms, which is good enough for me.<br />Loratadin (in different barnad-names, I like Lorano from Hexal) is available OTC here, if you want I can<br />send you some for free (shipping costs and the cost of the drugs), but you can probably get them yourself anyway.<br /><br />And of course follow the usual regime, take a shower before going to sleep, wash your hair, don&#039;t open windows, <br />don&#039;t eat things that contain histamines, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I personally suffer quite bad with hayfever.&nbsp; Its quite embarrassing in the midst of summer when your working with a load of fit polish girls!<br />However what works for me most of the time is a combination of Piriton tabs, eye drops and beneleze nose spray.<br />Its a fucking pain in the ass routine but it seriously takes the edge off.<br /><br />However, i had never pondered the use of other kinds of drugs before.&nbsp; &nbsp;Interesting thread guys!.

				There is now an immunotherapy pill which can be prescribed for very sever cases but it is generally not covered by government health services due to cost. So if money is plentiful then this may be your answer; Grazax.<br /><br />http://www.grazax.com/PatientSupportWebsite/Pages/PatientWelcome.aspx<br /><br />PS; maybe some guys on here may be able to source this cheap ;) Good luck.

				Hayfever is another reason I want to get the fuck out of England, it&#039;s a bloody pollen trap. However having said that I grew out of it more as I got older. <br /><br />What I find may help is using scripts but also washing your eyes with sterilized water every few hours.

				okay so i did some research and for the last 7 days or so i&#039;ve been on 120mg of Fexofendine Hydrochloride daily. and for the past 6 days i haven&#039;t really had &#039;bad&#039; hayfeaver, but i thought this was just a coincidence. But today i forgot to take the pill and my hayfeaver was back to being very bad.<br />So it seems that &#039;Fexofendine Hydrochloride&#039; is actually quite good at preventing the symptoms. :)

Started suffering when I was 13 and after about 15 years I got noticeably better. Now I just sneeze like a fucker. Used to have regular eye infections and a really sore, bright red nose, not a good look. I guess there are some benefits to slowly dying from age, weakened immune system being one. <br />I feel like I bang on about it all the time but promethazine is the shit for allergies, If I wake up sneezing I drop one after my breakfast and symptoms are reduced by about 90%.<br /><br />I visit Spain regularly and when I&#039;m there I have zero symptoms. If I knew how to cook speed (or anything else) i&#039;d go rent a place in the Spanish countryside and live off the profits.&nbsp; 8)
