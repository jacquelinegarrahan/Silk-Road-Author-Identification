				If one day the police come to your house, kick down your door and arrest you, is that not a case of kidnapping which is not considered a crime but occurs on a daily basis?

				Yes, it seems like the majority of people would vote for the third option, as insane as it obviously is

				also feel free to replace kidnapping with cold blooded murder, child rape, execution of innocents by slow torture, or bombing preschools, we don&#039;t have as many clear cut examples of people continuing to vote in favor of the third option but in principle it is all the same

				Imo, it all depends on the cause and what you do, So for example, if someone has just shot you in the arm, you get revenge on them. This should be left at that and nothing to be done. But if you were to kill them, that would be a different case altogether.<br />owever, if your motive for kidnapping and/or causing harm to them is driven without a reason, or for money/drugs or even general hate, this should then be treated as a prison sentance and/or small charges, depending on severity.<br /><br />But i think they need to understand, self defense is different to a case driven by pure hate.<br /><br />Locker.

				Okay feel free to imagine that it is a kidnapping motivated by money, hate or sadism. It could also be a kidnapping on the orders of a charismatic cult leader.

				I&#039;m totally against kidnapping in all forms. <br />&nbsp;I have always believed in a fair fight, and kidnapping for me is a extremely cowardly way to handle things, even if it is the police.&nbsp; It&#039;s a way of saying &quot;I am a cunt and i don&#039;t care who i take advantage of to get my jollies.<br />A crime punishable by reciprocity (revenge).&nbsp; Under ANY circumstances. <br />As for the police, we all know what shit-bags they are, and if this is an unfortunate incident that happens to someone, they should do everything in their power to rise up against the fuckers and make them pay, no matter how long it takes or how hard be the road traveled.<br />Sorry for the rant people, but i had to make a point.

If, lets say a cult leader, was to order you to go order you to torture some bitch that fucked with him, Out of the respect that you would gain&nbsp; you would follow his orders. However, if you dont wanna Gwan then you could just tell her to get out of town as quickly as she could. If the feds busted you through a wire, they would have recorded evidence of you clearly stating that you were going to kidnap and torture her, If they bust you with her, using the tape they would punish you severely, even if the woman admits to nothing happening, it would be based upon intent. Personally though, i think that if that was you, the charges should be dropped if no harm was done to her. However, as stated above i think that if you were to go and slash her, punch and humiliate her, a tough sentance should be given.<br /><br />Locker.<br /><br />

				I know alot of people will disagree with that, but I don&#039;t see it as a massive crime, I just think that they need to sort their shit out with their sentences, you prob get more years for sparing someones life than you do for actually killing someone.<br /><br />Locker.

				Kidnap with intent to harm or intent to scare will get you a good long, and well deserved sentence in prison.<br />Whatever the circumstances, withholding someone against their will, in the eyes of the law, will get you sent down.<br />
