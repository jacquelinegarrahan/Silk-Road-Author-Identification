				Hey whats up everybody i need your advice on this I&#039;m planning on buying molly from here and then selling on the streets.... but the only thing is i don&#039;t know what the street value of molly is and i also don&#039;t know how to measure it and such, how much to put in each capsule etc and such, Can anybody help me out with this info?.... I&#039;m on the East of USA ( street value prices ) Also who would be the best vendor to get mdma from at a good price so i can make better profit? that is in the U.S, i wouldn&#039;t want to risk my package getting caught by customs if i order out of the states.... Is it better to buy the molly in capsules or just the crystals and make my own capsules, what would you recommend?&nbsp; You can also PM me....

				Depends entirely on your location and network.<br /><br />Base line price would be $10 per 100mg. Ive sold it as high as $30 per 100mg and as cheap as $6 per 100mg, on single caps.

				Yea, well i was referring to single caps, or up to maybe 3 at a clip. People that are avid users, will obviously take at least 10 at a clip, in which case you have to drop the numbers drastically.

				shit, how much can it drop on like 10 or 20. I mean even at like 100 x 100mg it&#039;s still gotta be kicking around 3+.&nbsp; I would be happy doing 2 per 100mg on 1000 or more caps.

				i sell eightballs for like 250$, and half oz&#039;s for around 825$<br /><br />Middle US, people seem to dig it. I sell single grams for&nbsp; 80-90$ depending how much i paid and how well i Know em. Single caps go for ~10$<br /><br />Considering theres a lot of bunk shit for around the same price i sell pure crystals, and if anyone else does have pure crsytals they usually charge more, I dont do too bad

Been reselling for a few months here. I import it internationally for cheaper (think 25-35 per gram) and sell at 10$ a point (100mg) unless they&#039;re buying a gram or more at which point I knock the price down to 90 or 80 (depending on what I feel I can get away with.) The main issue is people trying to undercut you by selling methylone, but I just point out that my stuff&#039;s the best and other people are probably selling fake shit. Very profitable, but I&#039;m not enjoying the wait times on some of my orders since they&#039;re overseas.

				In the southwest I&#039;d say $10-15 for 100mg of quality MDMA.&nbsp; Most people who want larger quantities will receive them uncapped (to save me time) and I will sell those as low as $7-8.

				You can think of methylone as a MDMA-lite. It produces the same high but at 60% potency.On the street everyone buys &quot;molly&quot; is really getting methylone sold as mdma since as the other user stated the prices are far better. Selling a kilo of methylone will net 36k cash for a cost of 2500 international or 7k domestic. You can also sell it as methylone to people for a cheaper price of say 500 an oz and still net 18k cash

				if methylone will show up on drug testing kits, then I would advise against selling methylone off as MDMA. Eventually someone might get wise and use a reagent test, then your gonna be in a whole mess of trouble when all of your buyers find out you&#039;ve been lying about what your selling them. Although I see the appeal and am now interested in trying some methylone, the average, uneducated drug user will likely be very apprehensive about taking methylone, most likely because it has the term &quot;meth&quot; in the title

				youy people are def undercutting the price. i sell 150mg casps for 20 and some peeps i sell for 25. never had a problem finding buyers at those prices. grams ill sell for 100 some people 125 and at one point bout a yesr ago was selling at 200 till more cocksuckers started finding out bout sr and more legit stuff started hitting the street. i sell 3.5 g for 325. 5 g for 400 10 g for 700 and 20 g for 1200. and if someone wants a bunch of caps say 10 or more i just say hey i usually sell em for 25 buyt if your buying that many ill drop it top 20. then they think theyre getting a good deal. <br /><br />oh and putinworks im on the east coast and if you try and sell in my neighborhood ill break your legs and feed you to the fishes!!! just kidding.....kinda! but a word of advice if your gona sell sell the realshit not that garbage methylone. one thing bout my buyers is they know im the most honest dealer alive. i test my shit in front of them when they ask and they know im giving them top quality uncut. the way i recieve it is the way they recieve it and they know that. people that order large amounts gets there shit from me still vacuumed sealed so they know it hasnt been tampered with. if your honest and upfront with your buyers youll never have to worry bout them going elsewher cause why would they want to take a chance frome somewhere else when they already know my shit is top gear and i dont fuck around!! every once in a while ill throw my top buyers a freebie. some i give a coupole caps of mda others ill throw a few extra pills or caps. just dont try and decieve people saying what you have is mdma when in reality its methylone. thats what sr is trying to change in the scene for people to receive quality and it dont help when you have acess to quality and end up lying and selling garbage. just my 2 cents&gt;

Always come at a new customer with a higher price.&nbsp; They will almost always try to negotiate a price as they buy larger quantities and as long as you&#039;re giving them some significant discount for bulk they will compare it to the original price you started off selling to them at.<br />b.) Get rid of customers who keep trying to low-ball you when your offer is already reasonable.&nbsp; Some individuals just want to take take take and if demand is high enough for your product then either i.) drop them or ii.) make them come to you.&nbsp; I have some customers who keep thinking I&#039;ll come to wherever they are on a Saturday night (when I want to be partying) to give them 2 pills.&nbsp; They do not get responses to their texts from me.<br />c.) If you do things right and get good stuff from SR then remember your stuff is always high in demand.&nbsp; You can call people on their bluffs and refuse to sell... they usually change their tune pretty quickly, especially when their next batch from another dealer is bunk.

I fucking hate the cocksuckers that want me to drive down to them when they&#039;re buying like 1 hit. I&#039;ve got my own life to deal with too. As to point c, remember that something like 60-80 percent of the U.S.&#039;s &#039;molly&#039; is really methylone. Odds are good that the other dealers they have are selling at or just below your prices but have a much shittier product. I once had someone test my stuff and another guy&#039;s in front of me and they were blown away that their &#039;molly&#039; wasn&#039;t mdma. People just don&#039;t know.

				About 90 a gram.&nbsp; But I&#039;ve seen people selling it for as much as 150. I don&#039;t know why you&#039;d even pay that it.

				around 80-100 a g<br /><br />lot&#039;s of RC around though, if you can prove it is pure MDMA or MDA you can raise the price 20 -40 bucks and people are happy.
