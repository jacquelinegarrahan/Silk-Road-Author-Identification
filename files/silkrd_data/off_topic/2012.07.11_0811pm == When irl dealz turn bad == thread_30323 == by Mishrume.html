				Back in college I picked up a quarter ki with a friend/associate and his cousin (both these dudes were total hood niggas, but I don&#039;t mean anything bad by that; both were trustworthy guys who had great C and H hookups).&nbsp; We were doing lines off the center console in his tinted-out caddy when we realized that there was an enormous hole in the bottom of the bag, and about an ounce of cocaine had spilled into my friend&#039;s lap, who was driving.&nbsp; The next 10 minutes were spent scrapping coke up off his crotch area as he continued to drive, and his cousin made a joke about ending up on America&#039;s Dumbest Criminals that had us all cracking up. <br /><br />Good times!&nbsp; <br /><br />If I ever re-establish a relationship with these guys (haven&#039;t seen them in about a year and a half, no reason in particular other than that I&#039;m out of that life now), I&#039;ve thought about mentioning SR to them, I know for a fact that they could significantly undercut any other US seller for C, and probably H too.

				Went to grab an ounce of whites through a hookup that id never done business with before , decided id go alone because i heard they where straight(I was young dont laugh lol) got jumped at the meeting spot by four wiggers wearing bandannas on their faces and in their pockets probably had some stuffed up their ass for all i know...I really hate wiggers theyre like fucking clowns at the circus. Scrapped with them got pretty fucked up two black eyes, swollen jaw, lost a tooth and the back of my head was bleeding pretty bad anyway as you might imagine they where faggots and couldnt get the money from me even though they knew I had it. Later on i found out where one of them lived...sucker

				I&#039;ve seen oregano sold in quick drops as weed several times, jumpings, people being robbed, cut dope, money up front being taken with no reply..<br /><br />The one good thing I can remember is a guy fucked my buddy over royally, and they found where he lived, rushed his front door, beat him unconscious, took everything from his fridge, his TV, clothes off his back and his clothes out the dryer. Left him nothing like the Grinch. <br /><br />People are fucking crazy.

				Someone who I thought was a &quot;friend&quot; introduced me to this guy so we could do a deal on a few keys of Meph but it turned out they both planned it to jack me. So he brought him to a sit-down at my house (I didn&#039;t think anything of it at the time, stupid I know) and I had a chat with them and hashed out details etc and arranged it for the next day. When they came back the next day there was 6 of them Klavad up with knuckle dusters on and the stormed by back door and battered me in my own living room and took what they could find. Only stupid thing was they only found 250g + 1 n half grand when there was another 8 keys + 40K in my attic, thick fucks.

Was a minor price really. :)<br /><br />Oh and Brits can get straps but just not in the same way the Yanks can, I can get a gun now but it&#039;s just there isn&#039;t much variety.

I can hide a few bodies no problem, it&#039;s a fucking desert, but it does still happen to people down here. Now if you head into Phoenix, that&#039;s an entirely different story. The place is like a magnet for the worst filth on the planet, that city scares me to death. 115 degree heat surround by concrete and metal, poisoned by pollution, homeless roam the streets along with the prostitutes and gangbangers while drunk college students stumble in a daze wasting their lives. That place is Hell, I&#039;m sure of it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The U.S. state of Arizona has more places with the word &quot;Hell&quot; in their names than any other state of the United States. In 1994, the U.S. Geological Survey listed 60 such place names. Arizona has been associated with Hell since the 19th century. In 1860, Senator Benjamin Wade observed of Arizona that &quot;t is just like Hell — all it lacks is water and good society&quot;. One popular song, &quot;Hell In Arizona&quot;, describes how the Devil was allotted Arizona, and populated it with several forms of unpleasant animals and plants. The last verse reads:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; He fixed the heat at a hundred and &#039;leven,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And banished forever the moisture from heaven;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; And remarked as he heard his furnaces roar<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; That the heat might reach five hundred more.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I see what Gaz is getting at with the stoner question, but unfortunately, it&#039;s not just stoners that smoke weed.&nbsp; Weed is popular with &quot;Gangsta&quot; types nowadays, and most of the local chavs around here smoke weed all day just because there is fuck all else to do.&nbsp; They still go out and beat up old ladies, but they also smoke weed.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Oh I have to tell one of my few scary stories! This wasn&#039;t exactly a deal gone bad, but I think fits the criteria all the same.<br /><br />This is the single stupidest, luckiest, and worst time I have ever had.<br /><br />Around 6 years ago, I was 18 or 19, I was working as a desk clerk at a hotel and one night this very good looking guy came in, we&#039;ll call him Ted, and off and on all night Ted would come to the desk and chat with me, was flirty and all that, and I was a freakin idiot and instantly agreed to go to breakfast with him the next morning when I got off work (I worked the graveyard shift) when he asked me, I gave him my&nbsp; number to call me. <br /><br />Anyway about 1 am my boss called me and said to be aware that the DEA had a bust set up to go down in one of the hotel rooms soon (I wasn&#039;t allowed to know who, or details), so not to be alarmed when I see them storm through there. I said ok, and sure enough awhile later the uniformed team came through, and when they busted the room down there was no one in it, the person they were after had disappeared already, so it seemed a fail. The night went on normally, except Ted had disappeared.<br /><br />At that point I made absolutely no connection between Ted and this bust. He was extremely clean cut looking, appeared wealthy-business like, no &quot;drug dealer&quot; stereotypical signs. After the failed bust I didn&#039;t see him the rest of my shift. When I got off work at 7am, he called me and asked if we were still on for breakfast, and I met with him, ate, and he mention that he liked to smoke weed occasionally and I said well great so I! Then he invited me to his place to smoke a bowl, that&#039;s when I realized that he lived in town, and I thought briefly &quot;Why would a guy that lives here in town need an average hotel room by himself for a night?&quot; but again, 19 and stupid, I brushed it off. <br /><br />So I followed him back to his place, it was an EXTREMELY nice condo complex, like giant 3 story townhomes, just visibly an expensive neighborhood. I remember so clearly when we parked, as we were walking up to his front door a security guard drove by us, stopped and just gave us both the strangest look, and then slyly smiled, tipped his hat and drove on. Like he knew something we didn&#039;t. I went up to his front door and noticed Hmm, that&#039;s a bit odd, there&#039;s a security camera on his front porch. We went in and his place was even nicer on the inside, super sparkly clean, Tiffany furniture, all the high-tech electronics, marble-granite coutertops, very &quot;upscale&quot; looking.<br /><br />We sat in his living room and he went to his bedroom and came back with some bud, and started breaking it up. I noticed on his big screen TV was the camera footage from the front porch. His phone rang, he answered it and said something like, &quot;Yeah, just come on by, I&#039;ll be here&quot;. When he hung up he said a friend was stopping by to buy the rest of his smoke from him. After a few minutes I had to pee, so I went to the bathroom in the back of the place. <br /><br />As soon as I walked out and headed back for the living room I hear this LOUD banging on the door, so loud it made me jump, and someone yelling something. I made a sarcastic comment of, &quot;Who do think that is, the police?&quot; and laughed a bit. I looked at his face, he was looking at the TV, and he just says, very calm and matter-of-factly, &quot;Oh my God, it IS the police.&quot; Before I even had time to comprehend what he had just said the front door flies open, pieces of it going everywhere, and a team of about 10 completely decked out DEA agents with helmets, bullet-proof vests, and huge guns pointed at my head come through. They start screaming at me to get down on my hands and knees and crawl outside. <br /><br />Now, I have absolutely no criminal record. Have never been arrested, I have had like 2 speeding tickets my whole life. My adrenaline was pumping so hard I thought I was going to pass out, I couldn&#039;t even comprehend what was happening or why. I crawled outside into the front lawn, by then it was pouring down rain and when I get there they scream at me to lay down and put my hands on my head, still pointing guns at me. So I lay there, face-down in the mud and drench my clothes, one of them handcuffs me and by then I turn to look at Ted, and he is laying curled up on the ground too a few feet away from me, and the agents were literately kicking him repeatedly in the stomach, and like getting in his face and shit cussing him out. I closed my eyes for a minute I was so horrified, trying to process all of this. <br /><br />By then I pretty much got the picture, this guy, Ted, was the guy the police TRIED to bust at the hotel. I look in another direction and can see everyone in the entire complex peeking out from their cracked open doors and windows, just staring at me. I was so embarrassed, humiliated. All I could think was this is it, my life is over, my college scholarship is gone, my record ruined for life, my mom will disown me. <br /><br />Soon they stood both of us up, one of them asked me my name and as much as I wish I could say I was a tough cookie and kept my cool, even made some sarcastic comments to the pigs, I can&#039;t. I just started sobbing, I couldn&#039;t even remember my name I was just hysterically crying. They had a female agent take me in the bedroom alone and search me, and I had absolutely nothing on me, or in my purse (thank GOD), which they also searched and got my ID and info from.<br /><br />When we all regrouped in the living room and I was sat on the couch still handcuffed, Ted starts emphatically shouting that I had absolutely nothing to do with this, that I didn&#039;t even know what was going on, and that all the blame should be on him and I should be let go. The cops didn&#039;t seem to be listening, at this point they were tearing his house apart. And you know how before I said it was super clean and not suspicious at ALL? Dude, they pulled out so many pounds of drugs from SO many places that were basically in plain sight (a huge bag of what looked like thousands of ecstasy pills was in a hole in the wall behind a picture frame, giant bricks of either coke or something else white was cut out of the sofa cushions, etc) and THEN the craziest part of all, they start opening doors to what Ted told me were other &quot;bathrooms&quot; and &quot;closets&quot;, and pull PEOPLE out. That&#039;s right, when I thought we were alone just him and I, there were really about 5 fugitives hidden around his place for whatever reason, all but 2 of them didn&#039;t speak english. <br /><br />So I&#039;m on the sofa still hysterically crying, and one of the pigs asks where I work at, because I looked familiar. Without thinking rationally I stupidly told them the hotel that I worked at, and they all stop and look up and one of them goes, &quot;That&#039;s right, YOU were the desk clerk last night, and I&#039;ll bet YOU gave this guy the heads up he needed about us being there&quot;. So I stammer and try to explain that I had no idea that was Ted they were after, and Ted is still repeatedly denying my involvement in any of this. <br /><br />Anyway, long story short to wrap it up, after like 2 hours, they are all talking about what they will do with each of us, when they get to me, one of them mentions that I have no past criminal record and no drugs on me, and then the main chief looking guy just turns to me and asks, &quot;Do you want to go home?&quot; to which of course I sobbed &quot;Yes&quot;. He said, ok, then go. But I better never see you.... blah blah blah the usual. So they uncuff me and I go out to my car, and I remember my whole body was shaking so bad I could barely move my gear shift in the right position. I just drove around for like another hour, just in this daze at what had happened. CRAZY!

We went in and his place was even nicer on the inside, super sparkly clean, Tiffany furniture, all the high-tech electronics, marble-granite coutertops, very &quot;upscale&quot; looking.<br /><br />We sat in his living room and he went to his bedroom and came back with some bud, and started breaking it up. I noticed on his big screen TV was the camera footage from the front porch. His phone rang, he answered it and said something like, &quot;Yeah, just come on by, I&#039;ll be here&quot;. When he hung up he said a friend was stopping by to buy the rest of his smoke from him. After a few minutes I had to pee, so I went to the bathroom in the back of the place. <br /><br />As soon as I walked out and headed back for the living room I hear this LOUD banging on the door, so loud it made me jump, and someone yelling something. I made a sarcastic comment of, &quot;Who do think that is, the police?&quot; and laughed a bit. I looked at his face, he was looking at the TV, and he just says, very calm and matter-of-factly, &quot;Oh my God, it IS the police.&quot; Before I even had time to comprehend what he had just said the front door flies open, pieces of it going everywhere, and a team of about 10 completely decked out DEA agents with helmets, bullet-proof vests, and huge guns pointed at my head come through. They start screaming at me to get down on my hands and knees and crawl outside. <br /><br />Now, I have absolutely no criminal record. Have never been arrested, I have had like 2 speeding tickets my whole life. My adrenaline was pumping so hard I thought I was going to pass out, I couldn&#039;t even comprehend what was happening or why. I crawled outside into the front lawn, by then it was pouring down rain and when I get there they scream at me to lay down and put my hands on my head, still pointing guns at me. So I lay there, face-down in the mud and drench my clothes, one of them handcuffs me and by then I turn to look at Ted, and he is laying curled up on the ground too a few feet away from me, and the agents were literately kicking him repeatedly in the stomach, and like getting in his face and shit cussing him out. I closed my eyes for a minute I was so horrified, trying to process all of this. <br /><br />By then I pretty much got the picture, this guy, Ted, was the guy the police TRIED to bust at the hotel. I look in another direction and can see everyone in the entire complex peeking out from their cracked open doors and windows, just staring at me. I was so embarrassed, humiliated. All I could think was this is it, my life is over, my college scholarship is gone, my record ruined for life, my mom will disown me. <br /><br />Soon they stood both of us up, one of them asked me my name and as much as I wish I could say I was a tough cookie and kept my cool, even made some sarcastic comments to the pigs, I can&#039;t. I just started sobbing, I couldn&#039;t even remember my name I was just hysterically crying. They had a female agent take me in the bedroom alone and search me, and I had absolutely nothing on me, or in my purse (thank GOD), which they also searched and got my ID and info from.<br /><br />When we all regrouped in the living room and I was sat on the couch still handcuffed, Ted starts emphatically shouting that I had absolutely nothing to do with this, that I didn&#039;t even know what was going on, and that all the blame should be on him and I should be let go. The cops didn&#039;t seem to be listening, at this point they were tearing his house apart. And you know how before I said it was super clean and not suspicious at ALL? Dude, they pulled out so many pounds of drugs from SO many places that were basically in plain sight (a huge bag of what looked like thousands of ecstasy pills was in a hole in the wall behind a picture frame, giant bricks of either coke or something else white was cut out of the sofa cushions, etc) and THEN the craziest part of all, they start opening doors to what Ted told me were other &quot;bathrooms&quot; and &quot;closets&quot;, and pull PEOPLE out. That&#039;s right, when I thought we were alone just him and I, there were really about 5 fugitives hidden around his place for whatever reason, all but 2 of them didn&#039;t speak english. <br /><br />So I&#039;m on the sofa still hysterically crying, and one of the pigs asks where I work at, because I looked familiar. Without thinking rationally I stupidly told them the hotel that I worked at, and they all stop and look up and one of them goes, &quot;That&#039;s right, YOU were the desk clerk last night, and I&#039;ll bet YOU gave this guy the heads up he needed about us being there&quot;. So I stammer and try to explain that I had no idea that was Ted they were after, and Ted is still repeatedly denying my involvement in any of this. <br /><br />Anyway, long story short to wrap it up, after like 2 hours, they are all talking about what they will do with each of us, when they get to me, one of them mentions that I have no past criminal record and no drugs on me, and then the main chief looking guy just turns to me and asks, &quot;Do you want to go home?&quot; to which of course I sobbed &quot;Yes&quot;. He said, ok, then go. But I better never see you.... blah blah blah the usual. So they uncuff me and I go out to my car, and I remember my whole body was shaking so bad I could barely move my gear shift in the right position. I just drove around for like another hour, just in this daze at what had happened. CRAZY!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is a crazy story! <br /><br />I have been lucky enough to never have had a bad experience while getting drugs. (touch wood)<br /><br />The drug scene in my country is comparatively different than in the US, by the sounds of it anyway!

				Whoa some of you fukkers are crazy! Australia seems pretty tame in comparison. I&#039;ve never had any troubles in my quests but then again I&#039;m not exactly a pushover either.<br /><br />My worst experience? Baaaahahahaha... A younger friend of mine told me one of his mate could hook me up with a stick so i took him up on the offer. Bout half hour or so later a couple of juvies lobbed on my doorstep to make the drop. I payed them the $25 and sent them on their way. All seemed good until i decided to chop the lot up instead of packing a quick session like i normally do, anyways i opened the bag and squeezed it into my chop bowl and that&#039;s when i realized the little cunts had stung me, the bottom half of my stick was fucking grief.. So i told my mate to call the little cunts to bring my money back or someone was gonna get their arses handed to them. They came back believe it or not haha! Got my coin back, kept their shitty little home grown tips and leaf and shoved them out my front door and in no uncertain terms told them to fuck off.. Fuckheads..

				Y&#039;all sound like the trailer park boys!&nbsp; Funny shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was at a dealers house once, buying hash oil.&nbsp; Sitting on the couch chatting when the cops started banging on the door.&nbsp; Its a raid!&nbsp; &nbsp;They couldn&#039;t get the door open after banging many times and shouting. . . my dealer was pacing back and forth with a few vials of oil in his hands.&nbsp; He was gagging while trying to swallow them and panicking...&nbsp; He whipped his pants down and started jamming the vials into his ass... He got them all in and them walked over to the door and opened it for the cops.&nbsp; &nbsp;They swarmed in with guns blazing and tackled him to the floor.&nbsp; &nbsp;We were sitting on the couch in amazement.&nbsp; we were just there to buy a little vial of oil.&nbsp; The cops questioned everyone and let us go.&nbsp; they couldn&#039;t find anything but papers. . . . I wonder if his asshole got chewed up from shoving those into there in such a hurry. . . hehe. . he looked scared. .. standing there with his pants around his ankles bent over, and vials of oil in his hands&nbsp; &nbsp;hahaah<br /><br />I never went back to that place again.

				Had a number of fake Acid transactions. But one time I decided to buy about $100 worth of it from this friend of a friend, I met him up outside in his neighborhood, he got in my car and I gave him the money when he told me he&#039;ll go back in his house to get the L from his house. He then told me to drive in and out of his neighborhood so my parked car won&#039;t draw attention. I stupidly didn&#039;t see anything wrong with this and decided to drive around for a minute and come right back and I stayed there for 30 minutes without him coming back out so I kept calling this prick but no answer and I don&#039;t even know what house he went in to. I was soo pissed.
