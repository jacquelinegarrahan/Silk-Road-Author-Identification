				ok, I have a buddy that is in prison now that use to make at least one $80,000 run a month.&nbsp; He always wanted me to do ome for him for cash and never did.&nbsp; Now he is locked up and im sick of the b.s.dope im wanting to make a run,&nbsp; ANy advice is apreciated.&nbsp; I am going to drive to MIAMi and then take a plane to S.America.&nbsp; He warned me that it is dangerous over there and be careful not to get ripped off or shot!&nbsp; So, is it easy to get great stuff for a good price?&nbsp; Will it be hard to get someone to deal with me being I only have 3,000 to 4,000?&nbsp; I have everything else pretty planned out to a tee.&nbsp; So, a rental car is going to work out great and if bad happens on the way back, we didnt know that was there or Id have been doing it!&nbsp; LOL...im excited and nervous, my buddy made a shit load of money doing this and can handle the cops and driving back from Florida, I would like to talk with someone who has went to S. America to buy boy and girl.&nbsp; should I try to buy it in Florida or it willl cost to much wont it?&nbsp; When my buddy was doing it he would sell me a oz for 1300 and it was top notch!&nbsp; 100 dollar grams all day, cuz good coca sells itself.&nbsp; Just pk shit will ruin a potential customer.&nbsp; I have always been proud of my product, now my buddy isnt doing it, its all junk.&nbsp; I cant move that shit people wont come back so what do yoou think, and am I going about this rite?&nbsp; I love adreniline rush and the only thing that scares my is going to deal in S America.&nbsp; Does it happen all the time or is it going to be hard or easy?&nbsp; $4,000 isnt much and will they take me serious?

				I&#039;m not going to lie, you sound like a over-enthusiastic amateur with no balls...please for your own safety...don&#039;t go waving your cash around in &quot;S.America&quot; because you&#039;ll most likely get your ass robbed at the very *least*.<br /><br />My advice would be to arrange for a visitation to your friend who&#039;s locked up and see if you can get some advice and contacts from him and work you way up from there...also have you thought about how your going to bring it back from S.America to Florida as that&#039;s the hard part...you WILL be under scrutiny if your coming back from a known &quot;drug source state/location&quot;

				I can see why you would think that cause of my crazy aproach to source more information here.&nbsp; Well my partner that is locked up shared most of the process with me.&nbsp; And I have been in the drug hustle all of my life. Buying and selling on the street.&nbsp; Ive got balls and I like adrenaline rushes, as I raced motocross through till I was 28 and knee couldnt take it anymore.&nbsp; Since my supplier has been locked up, i cant get anything that Im proud of selling.&nbsp; Its all junk and this guy taught me alot.&nbsp; he always had pure uncut cola.&nbsp; It sells itself and the people always come back.&nbsp; It is so true, and recently,&nbsp; I got a buyer 7grams against what my instink told me and he had taught me and they have not been back, probaly never will.&nbsp; So, I was moving a oz of super good cola a week, selling it by the gram at 100 a gram.&nbsp; 1300 investment turned 2800 every week.&nbsp; I was proud of my product and it was like clock work.&nbsp; I was happy, had loot and I miss it.&nbsp; My buddy was moving 2 birds a month.&nbsp; He was the best at it and always said he was climing a latter and it was getting better all the time.&nbsp; He has two more years and he would be happy as hell if I had some good shit set up when he got out.&nbsp; He taught me the hustle and I never wave around money, but I sure do miss the money!&nbsp; People call me all the time looking and i tell them Im not ready yet, cause the shit isnt what I need to make money and keep them coming to me.&nbsp; Im open to ideas, seems like I wouldnt have to go to S. America, cuz they pack it up in the submarine in the jungle.&nbsp; So can I get a good deal in Florida?&nbsp; Im comfortable moving big packages and dont get nervous at all.&nbsp; Im sure there are people that just drive subs and make a ton of money.&nbsp; By the time the shit gets to were I live, they want way to much and its stomped on junk!&nbsp; Its all about having pure good drugs and moving them and going a little bigger each time.&nbsp; I recently got into using heroin and it seems people buy that no matter what.&nbsp; The street heroin deeler knows that and gets whatever is cheapest and once in a while has somthing that keeps you coming back.&nbsp; Im always thinking this is stupid and I dont even feel anything and thats bullshit.&nbsp; He will be out in 2 and I will have my quality source back, but I want great drugs, to use here and there and to make money.&nbsp; Lately good drugs are so hard to source, Its got my mind spinning,&nbsp; Shouldnt I just got to Irac on a support our troops and opiates ralley?&nbsp; Fill 10 codems withgrade a heroin and swallow, go home and spin it?&nbsp; Or&nbsp; the xray machines will get me locked down before i get a chance to spin anything?&nbsp; That drug is amazing the money it brings for just a little bit.&nbsp; Well I will do what I can and have all doors open and have never hustled digitaly and its fuckin awesome that we can, I love gettin my shit deliverd, fuck yes!&nbsp; SO, as soon as I source some kick ass shit I will give it a wirl, but the shit around my area rite now isnt worth it.&nbsp; If anyone has a great source like I use to and wants to sell lots of it on a regular basis at a fair price, Im looking.&nbsp; &nbsp;Back to basicis, I need uncut pure drugs and reliable sources to get repeatitive sales over and over again.&nbsp; If you carry the stepped on shit that dont blow you away, you wont be in bussiness long!

				I apologize, seems like you know your stuff most posts I&#039;ve seen in the past typed out like your OP is usually over-excited kids &amp; wannabe drug dealers.<br /><br />I agree with what you say though, never dabbled in the coke trade mainly just weed for almost a decade with coke as there tends to be a shit ton of violence that goes along with the higher profit margins. I&#039;m not form the US but from what I know from films, books e.t.c isn&#039;t Florida in Miami? I thought Miami was flooded with that raw shit?<br /><br />Try asking around more, you probably don&#039;t need me to tell you to be careful but the people with the best shit are normally the hardest to find and dodgy/grimy as fuck. <br /><br />Let me know if you get back on your feet and you can ship abroad as I&#039;d be very very interested.<br /><br />Good luck mate

				Wow...after pondering this idea for a day or two it slapped me in the face!&nbsp; I cant believe I put that much thought into it and the safest best way to do this was right in front of me the whole time.&nbsp; I guess the only thing that was throwing me off was the price.&nbsp; So that would be down rite ignorant to drive all that way and put myself at a huge risk when someone else will do it for me and not even know it.&nbsp; LOL...is that fucking awesome or what!&nbsp; Thanks SR for making a complicated task super easy.&nbsp; Its hard to let go of old skool tacticks and this made it very clear on the way to do it.&nbsp; The prices are alot higher but, look at all the money saved in gas and food on the road.&nbsp; WOW...it doesnt take any thinking, it is obvious and If its there use it, its that simple!&nbsp; I kinda feel like a ass, to allow myself to get in such deep thought all because I couldnt let go of old risky tactics.&nbsp; I dont like change but in this case, change is way safer and it did slap me, it was in front of me laughing the whole time.&nbsp; Its liketaking something super simple and making it very complex.&nbsp; I dint like the price but its just like on the street, you are going to have to pay top dollar untill you establish good business and prove yourself.&nbsp; Ive heard of people down there that have established trust with the workers in the jungle and get like 50 to 100 grams of coca paste very cheap and finish the process themselves.&nbsp; Now if you give one of those people a computer that have the shit sent to them as needed, think about the possabilitys now!&nbsp; Im speechless and all I can say is this SR site is fucking awesome....I am old school and I was just using it to try some different products.&nbsp; I hope im not that simple minded, but when it hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks!&nbsp; It really is that simple now isnt it!&nbsp; I think it is just the begining and this process will really be hoppin 10 to 20 years!The goverment should throw in the cards and quit wasting money.&nbsp; This is a hard blow and its fucking funny cause it is effective, low risk and what more can you ask for?&nbsp; Better prices, I think that would come with regular consistant business.&nbsp; So, I came to a conclusion that I can control how I deal with a package that may have got hot in route.&nbsp; I know how to treat it and have no doubts cuz I know how to handle that package.&nbsp; Bring it in and let it sit awhile and dont open it.&nbsp; Now if you are pulled over in a hot car, you dont have any options!&nbsp; Its that simple and the truth is if your in the car its out of your hands when you are pulled over.&nbsp; Now if you get a hot package and you know how to handle that package you will be fine!&nbsp; Ive been up for like 7 days know and I think it is time to get some sleep.&nbsp; So, it was right in front of me the whole time and I had some stupid thinking going on cuz I didnt like the price.&nbsp; Im going to blame it on lack of sleep and hope you are laughing with me and not at me!&nbsp; Thanks SR for providing the ultiment service to my home, I cant ask for anything better and most people dont even know about it as it is new,&nbsp; Times are changing and this process is just in the begining stages...how sweet and luckey we are.&nbsp; The risk is going down and doors are opening and the sky is the limit!&nbsp; I just was going to use it to source some shit here and there and have it delivered rite to me...LOL....thats bullshit and it seems to be one of those things that start out small and with some time it turns into something big and lots of good things come out of it and the whole process was fun and has many rewards, just depends on what you want or are looking for!&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)
