				**** DONE thanks again to Knomo! You&#039;re one cool cat&nbsp; 8) ****<br /><br />Hi there. :)<br /><br /><br />Over my months on SR I&#039;ve helped a few people and am in need of a little help of my own. I&#039;m about .3 BTC short on an order (shipping) and was hoping someone could send it over. If you do please let me know and I&#039;ll repay you here in the next day or two (check my track record, always do).<br /><br /><br />Thanks again in advance! <br /><br />

				Thanks for the help! :) Just sent you back the .30 and if you ever need a little help don&#039;t think twice about messaging me here or on SR :) <br /><br />And sorry to hear that Locker. :/ I&#039;ve given a few times here and it really does suck when people don&#039;t seem appreciative.

				Ah - you are sorted! I got about 0.42 in my account - keep my stash of bitcoin in a wallet and only put it here when I am ready to buy and I have a basket full of orders!<br /><br />I have also spared a few BTC but unwisely to newbies one of whom even had the cheek to come back asking for the postage which was 1.2 BTC - lol! <br /><br />Another guy I loaned vanished, Only like 0.3 or 0.5 but makes you think you got scammers begging on every site - I am 0.25 short for pain killers for my dying mother, or &#039; I got cancer and smoke weed and am 2 BTC short&#039;. <br /><br />So in future I will try to throw that little bit of BTC to full members who might do me the favor. In fact I know many here would - or a few at least&nbsp; ;D Sorry if I annoy some but I get bored in work and this make it pass quicker. Posing here - looking on the main site to see any good deals. Looking for good coke as always. (UK preoccupation)<br /><br />A few weeks back I was short like 0.2 BTC for something but never had the courage to ask! I mean - lol - if we are a community then its easy to make it feel like one by doing these little favors. <br /><br />Newbies asking is a bit cheeky. Its like turning up to a pub and asking strangers to buy you a pint. IRL it would not happen. but on the web its full of people basically scamming with sob stories.<br /><br />But members here short for a bit of bud or coke or whatever, I&#039;d think about making that little loan if I could. And I do not expect it back. I just would like to be able to maybe ask for some silly little sum for when you spend everything and find some great bargain you are just short of when you add postage. <br /><br />So - I need 100 BTC to get a bit of yayo -&nbsp; :)<br /><br />no.<br /><br />I don&#039;t.<br /><br />but if ever I need 0.whatever I will swallow my pride and come here. <br /><br />
