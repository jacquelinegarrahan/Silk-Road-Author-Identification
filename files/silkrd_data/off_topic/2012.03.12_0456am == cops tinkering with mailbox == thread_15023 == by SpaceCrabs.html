				Guys im getting paranoid, I live in an apartment so there are a bunch of mailboxes. My mom told me she saw a cop trying to open one, she doesn&#039;t know which though. I got 2c-i a couple of days ago and i ordered lsd and shrooms which are on there way. Do you think their on to me? what should i do? How can make sure nothing happens if anything does happen? Im fucking scared.<br /><br />None of the packages where in my name btw

				That sounds really shady, but I would assume they would have to present you with a warrant to open your mailbox, unless the corp/people that own your apartment complex are douchebags and gave them a spare key. It may very well have been them checking mail for some other reason, maybe looking into a missing person or someone who fled on a warrant. It wouldn&#039;t make sense for them to look for your mailbox, especially if they&#039;re unsure when the package is coming. You would probably have been flagged by the post office first and foremost, and most likely presented with a search warrant of your premises second.<br /><br />Definitely keep an eye out though. You can never be too careful.

				lots of cops live at apts, you dont think it was just a cop checking his mail after getting off duty or something? <br /><br />i doubt it has anything to do with you ordering some drugs...

Your mail gets intercepted at the post office or sorting office, not your mailbox unless your local postal inspectors are astonishingly inept and did some manner of screw-up. So you probably don&#039;t need to worry.
