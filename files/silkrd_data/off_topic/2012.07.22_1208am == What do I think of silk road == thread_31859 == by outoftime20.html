				&nbsp;;D Well obviously this is a great place to be. I used to struggle to get ripped off and buy a joint for $25. Now I get ripped off less on weed... and it doesnt smell like shit. I once tried 5-meo-muipt. I felt weird and jacked off for 2 hours. What a trip! I once ate 6 weed cookies and my lumpy logger smelled quite earthy the next day. I bought a 10-strip from themunchies and took it all at once and thought I was god for 8 hours. And best of all I got high on SR with all my old buds<br /><br />What has silk road brought to your life?

				Drugs I never thought I&#039;d take and drugs I never knew existed are right at my fingertips. I also realised that drug-dealers and users aren&#039;t villains, they&#039;re normal people that post on forums and love dick jokes.
