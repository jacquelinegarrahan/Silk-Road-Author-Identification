				ill cover a little of my background in chem here, just to clear it up for everyone... i have none, other than consuming &#039;chemically motivating substances&#039; at events or clubbing&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />righto lol, <br />i always though MDMA in its most pure form smelt a little like aniseed, brown or dark tan in colour. then i found silk road. there seems to be so many different MDMA&#039;s.<br />iv even had MDMA that could be described as dark granite rock in colour, just more fine in its details.<br /><br />now, is what im seeing the left overs from the manufacture process?? left over chemicals from reductions or separations? the signature a cook leaves on purpose, or because of his procedures?

				Pure MDMA is either sparkling white or completely clear crystals depending on the size of the crystal and which solvents where used to recrystallise.<br />The majority of the MDMA sold by the big vendors on here is very pure, despite sometimes being coloured.<br /><br />Coloured MDMA is a result of the chemist not washing and recrystallising the product properly at the end of the synthesis. As the impurities are often highly coloured, it only takes a fraction of 1% of the weight to be an impurity for the product to be coloured so some dark brown MDMA can still have&nbsp; purity close to 100%. <br /><br />

				I just got a sample of some very nice MDMA. It seemed stronger than other stuff I had taken. Under a microscope the crystals are transparent, when looking at a pile it has a shiny grey color. It has only a light smell.<br /><br />I have had other stuff that is snow white which had a much stronger licorice smell and I did not enjoy that as much.

				Pure MDMA is a gold/brown translucent oil.&nbsp; All of the pure MDMA HCl from the manufacturing labs that I&#039;ve seen were pure white.&nbsp; That is before being crystallized.

It was simply amazing and smelt very strongly of licorice.<br />The whitest since then was from a german vendor from SR who i wont mention, for if i do his stock will never be available. ;)<br />But it was an amazing roll on only 100mg.
