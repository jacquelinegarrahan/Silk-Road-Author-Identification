				hello all! <br />I&#039;ve been looking into ecgis with tanks that you can get weed oil for.. you just take it and fill it up. <br />I would get one not just for regular use but mainly for concerts and festivals. <br />Has anybody have any good experience with these? what about just regular vape pens? <br />I dont want to have to refill every minute. <br />of course you can sneak a joint into a concert but im usually at the barrier and im not gonna spark a joint in front of a security guard lol.&nbsp; <br />any ideas? <br />edibles are good too, but they seem to get my very very sleepy within an hour. <br />

				I use an ecig with hash oil. I load it once, and I get a good 7-8 hits off it. The hash oil is very strong, so you only need 1 hit to get you blasted. Loading it once will get me through the whole day.<br /><br />They are VERY discreet. Ecigs are getting very popular with smokers who are trying to quit, so most people just assume that&#039;s what I&#039;m smoking.&nbsp; And if they ask, I just tell them I&#039;m trying to quit ;D They produce almost no smell whatsoever. I&#039;ve smoked my G-Pen in very public places. The other day I fired it up within 10 feet of a cop. I know they can&#039;t smell it, so I&#039;m not worried about it

				Hey I went to Camp Bisco earlier this month.&nbsp; I took my 2 micro g pens, both fully charged.&nbsp; I also took mad wax but didnt need everything i took.&nbsp; Between Wed (the day we left for bisco), thurs (the first day of bisco), fri, sat (the last day of bisco til 7am on sunday) both my gpens lasted me.&nbsp; Ok lemme explain... Oh and I have a lot of friends that mooched off me.<br /><br />I took a lil over 4 grams of wax and came back with more than 3, sorry all i have are estimates.&nbsp; Everyday I smoked out of my gpens religiously.&nbsp; Everytime I took a hit, atleast one person would ask me for a hit.&nbsp; That shit had us going.&nbsp; Around 8pm on fri my first gpen died, so I got the battery of the other gpen and put it on this one and used it til sunday morning!&nbsp; I didnt even have to worry about starting my car and wasting gas in order to charge my pens.&nbsp; I smoked weed I want to say 4 times when others would spark me up but honestly, once I got my gpen, I got addicted.<br /><br />Def get something that works for you though.&nbsp; The micro g pen only works with wax! Good luck on your search, hopefully your first is as great of an experience as my first =)<br /><br />Btw I got 2 micro gpens, 1 charger, 5 disposable rubber mouth sleeves (for sharing), 2 wax containers all for $60.&nbsp; The official website sells it for $100 but search it on google and I bet youll find it around $60.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				i own the micro g pen and have held the full size g pen in my hand. <br /><br />i would buy the full size g pen. why ? it has a capsul to put your oil in. alot bigger then the micro g pen. <br /><br />we all know that dark oil thats not really thick ? try smoking that out of the gpen when its already been running for 5 mins. you cant tip the thing sideways or your oil runs all up the inside and gets right grumy as fuck. i had to set one gpen only for the dark, 1 gpen only for the good oil. <br /><br />micro g pen is good but i fuckd it up and got it al sticky im to lazy to clean the bitch. i need that good good bho from my man PKHYDRO. that shit in the g pen and im straight high
