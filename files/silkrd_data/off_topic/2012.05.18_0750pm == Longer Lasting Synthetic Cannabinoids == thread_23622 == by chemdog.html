				I have smoking various types of synthetic cannabis mixtures for the last 6 months. However, I&#039;m a little bugged by the 15 minute high it provides.<br /><br />Has anyone got any suggestions for something that lasts a little longer, or is it a case of my receptors being a little too baked?

Huffman does not break the law. He says he’s never even gotten a speeding ticket. The one time he tangled with the police, he was 15. He and a buddy started a fire in the street with stuff from his chemistry set.&#039;<br /><br />“We got a free ride to the police station, and it scared the daylights out of both of us that they would notify our parents,” says Huffman.

However, cannabis is one of the times I really agree with the distinction. Not only is cannabidiol an anti-psychotic to THC&#039;s psychotic properties, thousands of years of evolution has given it the perfect ratio between the compounds. The plant&#039;s life depends on the animals not dying after ingestion of the chemicals to spread its seeds. The only way we could ever create a safe synthetic cannabinoid is if we change our policy on human experimentation. Or, after 100 years from now and we were able to gather enough data from illicit use. People can say &quot;synthetic cannabinoids must be safe since it works just like weed&quot; all they want but I don&#039;t believe it myself.
