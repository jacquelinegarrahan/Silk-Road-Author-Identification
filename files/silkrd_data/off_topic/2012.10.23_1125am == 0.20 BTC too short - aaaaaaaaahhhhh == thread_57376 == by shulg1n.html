				well seeing how new members come here every single day and ask for free coins - especially without even offering to pay them back, or when they do ask for a loan and offer to pay back like they should, shockingly the majority of the time they never do...&nbsp; how do we know youre not the same person who tries to get free coins everyday? we dont <br /><br />dont expect much assistance from the established members. we take care of each other, so if you had maybe even just posted a small number of times, there would likely be someone willing to help you out.<br /><br />but seeing how you felt the first thing worthy of your time and effort to contribute to the community was begging for coins - you will get no hand outs from me at least<br /><br />i will offer you some free advice though - go buy some more coins today so you can place that order you need

				These always make me chuckle.<br /><br />A pittance for an established member I could understand, but begging on your first forum post without an offer to pay back with some interest? Tsk tsk.

Dude what are you talking about? I didn&#039;t get any thread closed whatsoever [ http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=58935.0 ].. I only recived PMs from YOU saying I was a scammer and you would report me with no reason. Pelase stop acusing poeple whithout motives and stalk over PMs. I&#039;m not scamming anyone.<br /><br />Searched my own name to see if there was any post of my customers and found this. <br /><br />I don&#039;t have nothing to do with those people, and I would never &quot;beg for bitcoins&quot;, as you said also in your PMs, I don&#039;t know why you are relating me to these other people. I&#039;m SELLING a product with good reputation on BMR [ http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=view_listing&amp;id=2851 if you don&#039;t belive me ], so again, as I politely asked through PMs, Please stop saying NONSENSE . Thanks.

				Agreed with everyone. This is my first post on the forums however I have been on SR for almost 2 years now and I only just browse the forums. I have never begged for Bitcoins and I can&#039;t get over how many people beg for them...GTFO with your first post shit asking for money
