				&#039;Operation Log Jam&#039; Nationwide Synthetic Drug Takedown Raid seizes 19 million packets of synthetic drugs, $36 million in cash<br /><br />CSP Daily News | July 26, 2012<br /><br />WASHINGTON -- More than 90 individuals were arrested and more than five million packets of finished designer synthetic drugs were seized in the first-ever nationwide law enforcement action against the synthetic designer drug industry responsible for the production and sale of synthetic drugs that are often marketed as bath salts, Spice, incense,or plantfood. Morethan $36 million in cash was also seized.<br /><br />More than 4.8 million packets of synthetic cannabinoids(K2,Spice)and theproducts to produce nearly 13.6 million more, as well as 167,000 packets of synthetic cathinones (bath salts) and the products to produce an additional 392,000 were seized.<br /><br />Operation Log Jam was conducted jointly by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE), with assistance from the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service,U.S. Customs&amp; BorderProtection,FBI,Food &amp; Drug Administration&#039;s Office of Criminal Investigations,aswellascountlessstateand local law enforcement members in more than 109 U.S. cities and targeted every level of the synthetic designerdrug industry, including retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers.<br /><br />Click here to view the locations on a larger map.<br /><br />&quot;Although tremendous progress has been made in legislating and scheduling these dangerous substances,thisenforcement action has disrupted the entire illegalindustry, from manufacturers to retailers,&quot; said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. &quot;Together with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners, we are committed to targeting these new and emerging drugs with every scientific,legislative, and investigativetool atourdisposal.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Today, we struck a huge blow to the synthetic drug industry. The criminal organizations behind the importation, distribution and selling of these synthetic drugs have scant regard for human life in their reckless pursuit of illicit profits,&quot; said acting director of ICE&#039;s Office of Homeland Security Investigations James Chaparro. &quot;ICE is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring this industry to its knees.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The synthetic drug industry is an emerging area where we can leverage our financialinvestigative expertise to trace the path of illicit drug proceeds by identifying the financial linkagesamong the various co-conspirators,&quot; said Richard Weber, chief of IRS criminal investigation. &quot;Wewill continue working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and ultimately dismantle the highest level drug trafficking and drug money laundering organizations that pose the greatest threat to Americans and American interests.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The U.S. Postal Inspection Service aggressively investigates the use of the U.S. Mail system for the distribution of illegal controlled substances and its proceeds. Our agency uses a multi-tiered approach to these crimes: protection against the use of the mail for illegal purposes and enforcement of laws against drug trafficking and money laundering. This includes collaboration with other agencies,&quot; said chief postal inspector Guy J. Cottrell of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.<br /><br />&quot;The mission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is to guard our country&#039;s borders from people and goods that could harm our way of life,&quot; said U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection acting commissioner David V. Aguilar. &quot;We are proud to be part of an operation that disrupts the flow of synthetic drugs into the country and out of the hands of the American people.&quot;<br /><br />While many of the designer drugs being marketed today that were seized as part of Operation Log Jam are not specifically prohibited in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (AEA) allows these drugs to be treated as controlled substances if they are proven to be chemically and/or pharmacologically similar to a Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substance. A number of cases that are part of Operation Log Jam will be prosecuted federally under this analogue provision, which specifically exists to combat these new and emerging designer drugs.<br /><br />DEA has used its emergency scheduling authority to combat both synthetic cathinones (the so-called bath salts like Ivory Wave, etc.) and synthetic cannabinoids (the so-called incense products like K2, Spice, etc.), temporarily placing several of these dangerous chemicals into Schedule I of the CSA. Congress has also acted, permanently placing 26 substances into Schedule I of the CSA.<br /><br />In 2010, poison centers nationwide responded to about 3,200 calls related to synthetic &quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;bath salts.&quot; In 2011, that number jumped to more than 13,000 calls; 60% of the cases involved patients 25 and younger.

Perhaps all the LE involved meet at the local Blue Oyster Bar for their meetings and to &quot;pat&quot; one another on the back.<br /><br />Police Academy Reference for you young folk.<br />&nbsp;<br />

				This is a result of the DEA getting a new ban on synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones.&nbsp; This is their first action with these new bans.&nbsp; I wonder what they are going to do next?&nbsp; Perhaps they are going to try go after clearnet RC vendors abroad?&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how they could do this, but I&#039;m curious what&#039;s next.

				My city just reported that local authorities cracked down on multiple head shops selling synthetic cannabis. They went as far as to show someone who was in the hospital due to it. Pulling at your heart strings and all. The individual that was hospitalized went on to say that nobody should smoke that shit as it is dangerous, when a little bit previous they stated that their body would always tell them when to stop. I&#039;m guessing that person never researched what they were smoking and just smoked until they felt fucked.<br /><br />They did sound like they had a 3rd grade education at the most. But to hear idiots spewing false information pisses me off. That drug she was taking is only dangerous if you use it like a dumbass.
