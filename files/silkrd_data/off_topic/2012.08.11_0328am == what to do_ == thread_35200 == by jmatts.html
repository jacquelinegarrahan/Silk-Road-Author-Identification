				Hi jmatts,<br /><br />Your incessant bumping of this thread is going to earn you no favours or donations from anyone. Others shouldn&#039;t have to part with their money simply because you failed to buy enough extra Bitcoin to protect you from the possibility of a value increase.<br /><br />Contact your vendor, tell them that due to price fluctuations you&#039;re X amount short, and ask if they&#039;re willing to re-list the custom order at a slightly lower price and you&#039;ll send them the difference directly when you buy your next lot of Bitcoin. Some vendors are willing to compromise on prices in good faith, others aren&#039;t.<br /><br />If this vendor DOES agree, then make sure that you DO repay them the difference.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I think the odds of somebody donating coins to you are virtually zero. You certainly won&#039;t get it from me - when I first came to SR I had an abundance of Bitcoin and helped a number of people out who were short on orders, without asking them to pay me back. They all said the would anyway, of course, but only 2 ever did. That&#039;s no problem, I didn&#039;t want it back anyway, I was just doing it to help out the community. So I&#039;ve &quot;served my time&quot; in the Bitcoin donation arena, so to speak.<br />Since then there&#039;s been a huge influx of users, many of whom seem to forget that Bitcoin is relatively volatile where it&#039;s value is concerned. Purchase a few more than you&#039;ll need. At the very least, you can use them on your next order or two.<br /><br />I have to ask though, if this were a genuine request and not just an attempt to get some free Bitcoin, is there a reason you can&#039;t contact your vendor?<br /><br />Which vendor is it? Some outrageously kind soul may consider issuing you a gift voucher that can only be spent with that specific vendor.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
