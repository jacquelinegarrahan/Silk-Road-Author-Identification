				So, I recently posted some things about my wife and my suspicions that she was cheating..<br /><br />For any of you that followed, I ended up reading some messages she failed to delete from her phone that pretty much verified she was TRYING to.<br /><br />The reason I&#039;m posting this though, is because I read her responses to him several times and it surprisingly did not anger me.<br />Reading her responses and how she described her fantasies from seeing his dick pix kind of turned me on.<br />Not the dick part, but just how detailed her fantasies were in response to him. She never tells me these fantasies. So it was seeing a new part of her.<br /><br />My question is, does this make me a cuckold or something? Because the more I think about it, the more it turns me on to see my wife being pleasured, of course with me in her mouth, but regardless. Is this somewhat normal?<br /><br />I love my wife, so I just look at it like sex. nothing else. <br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />

				Well I&#039;ll pop in here because, from those I&#039;ve talked to, this isn&#039;t something that&#039;s agreed upon much but I&#039;ll share a little personal philosophy I&#039;ve adopted thanks to a friend or two:<br /><br />short answer: sex is sex. Whatever that means to you. A lot of of people seem to think it&#039;s an emotional abandonment to cheat on someone. Well, one of my best friends has an open relationship.

I could see the truth in her about this, plus I know this guy pretty good.

				As long as you guys are checking in with each other feelings and is fine with it there shouldn&#039;t be an issue. She like&#039;s it, you like it, that one guy likes it, EVERYBADY HAPPY haha<br />But if jealousy begins to creep up then put a pause on things (although it sounds like that&#039;s not the case). It sounds like you guys care a lot about each other. She didn&#039;t even meet up with the guy because she felt bad, it&#039;s obvious she loves you. She&#039;s not leaving you, she workin&#039; with you! That is awesome.<br /><br />

				Sounds like things will work out: I&#039;m happy for you all. I hope things go well as I know this kind of thing can go south quick. Not trying to get all pessimistic but just repeating what another said above: if you start getting second thoughts the best thing is to let her know asap. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				I think almost everyone here has given you better advice than I can, but I just hope for the best with your relationship with your wife :) . This may sound cheesy as shit but maybe take her out for a nice dinner one evening and make her feel special, have a little to drink, and go home to bed. Maybe she might reconsider what she&#039;s doing the next day and forget about that guy? <br />I don&#039;t know really, but by the sounds of it you&#039;re really handling the situation well, thats something to be proud of.

				I feel for you homey, I think all men get turned on by other men steaming of their birds. ( girlfriends) You have to keep her on her toes mate. It seems she needs that kind of treatment, some women do. I think that&#039;s the part turning you on, not the point it&#039;s another persons&nbsp; &nbsp;cock&#039;.But that she want&#039;s it. try role playing with her, you maybe peep on her while she&#039;s masturbating, or Dress up as someone else and take her by force, obviously tell her you have a surprise and take it from there. I did one time also get aroused by the thought of 3 dudes giving my g/f one you know like her bouncing on one&#039;s cock while the other fuck&#039;s her bottom, and the 3rd gets a suck, That would be so fucking horny come to think of it. It turned out it was all part of my imagination and paranoia because she works in an adult bar, I though the bouncers and her boss where having cocaine fueled sex parties with her and other girls at work. You need to dominate her now mate or your going to be dominated.
