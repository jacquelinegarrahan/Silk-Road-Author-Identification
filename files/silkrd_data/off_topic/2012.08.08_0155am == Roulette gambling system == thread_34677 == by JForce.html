				Hey,<br /><br />My mate sent me the link to this website: http://omgsecret.com/<br /><br />It&#039;s basically a system for roulette that you bet £1 then if you lose, bet £2 to cover yourself from the last bet etc.<br /><br />Just read the method on the website.. once you have what are your thoughts on this?<br /><br />I&#039;ve just done it for about an hour and a half and won £40 but have had some scary moments while doing it.. didn&#039;t like how scary it can get so just withdrawn the money.

				Commonly known as the Martingale System in sports betting ( lose a bet, double your next one )<br /><br />If you have the bankroll, its feasible.

				You could just sell a few Adderall and make more money with less risk. No real point to this that I can see.

				Have tried this method at casinos starting with the lowest bet of 1 dollar. Table limit was 1000, which is pretty high for any game that starts at 1. The method works, but you will be freaking the fuck out if you lose 10 times in a row. The reason why this is not a good idea is because once you hit the limit (which is about 10-14 losses in) you are basically fucked. The amount you earn will be far far less than what you are putting up at the end (1 dollar per win).<br /><br />You would also need at least double of the table limit for this method to work, otherwise once you need to pay 1000+ you won&#039;t have any left. I&#039;ve really tried using this method, but the amount of ball squeezing fear you get can give you a heart attack. I&#039;m a gambler so the rush is really amazing until you lose.<br /><br />Also, the best game to do this in would actually be Baccarat instead of Roulette. Lowest house edge = best return for your system (almost 50/50 odds)
