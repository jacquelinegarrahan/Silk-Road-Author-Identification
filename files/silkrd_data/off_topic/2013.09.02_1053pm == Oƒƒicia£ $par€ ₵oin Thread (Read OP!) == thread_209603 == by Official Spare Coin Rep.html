				Hey guys and gals, I&#039;m currently trying to buy my first gram of H off SR and I&#039;m almost there, I know it&#039;s quite a bit more than the usual requests, but I am short exactly 0.2032 BTC. If someone does lend it to me I will pay them back double (0.4064) in exactly 3 days.<br /><br />I completely understand if nobody can do it, I just figured I would give it a shot because I start my new job (YAY!) in 5 days and I do not want to be withdrawing my first day of work, so I need to get it sooner than 5 days so I can have it by the time I start working.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can&#039;t do it, I thank you all for your generosity.<br /><br />Thanks everybody. <br /><br />SR name --&nbsp; whoindabushes<br /><br /><br />P.S. If you decide to lend it to me and 0.4064 BTC is not enough of a payback, please PM me and we can work out a deal.<br /><br />

Once I was in what struck me as some sort of hyperspatial bachelorette pad, and the entity I met there was easily visually and otherwise recognizable as a young woman.<br /><br />A much weirder instance is the time I walked up to what appeared to me to be a family picnic, the elf-space equivalent of suburban home, mom, dad, 2 kids, steaks on the grill, and a excitable ball of light that I immediately identified as a dog/puppy running around everywhere, very playful. All of this made complete sense at the time.<br /><br />One of the more sinister entities I encountered is the first time I tried Sally and The Deemster. There was probably 20mg or so of DMT in my steamroller (best smoking device ever, btw), plus any residue in the screens (usually not enough to break through on its own), on top of which I added some 10x Salvia leaf. I may have weighed it out at the time, but I don&#039;t remember now. It wasn&#039;t much.<br /><br />As soon as I got that second hit in, and held it, there was this bizarre entity that approached me quickly, directly from the front, which was at once off-putting, as usually the entities I encounter are a little more relaxed, and while interested in me, not all up in my face about it. It was vaguely humanoid, the first figure that comes to mind is the iconic &quot;Burning Man&quot; image:<br />\&nbsp; o&nbsp; /<br />&nbsp;\ | /<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;|<br />&nbsp;/&nbsp; \<br />/&nbsp; &nbsp; \<br /><br />As it approached me, instead of cocking its head to the side, as one might expect an entity to do when encountering something unknown, its whole torso bent 90 degrees a little above where the human waist would be, and she just kind of stared at me a bit. Weirded me out a bit. Oddly enough, I just kept telling myself that Harvey Wallclimber was a little orange cat (as opposed to the barrage of bizarre imagery/linguistic objects presented to me by the Salvia people), and a few minutes later, I was back out, and there was an orange cat on my lap to comfort me. Harvey be praised!

				@Mary All the people I&#039;ve got from were US domestic but some of my favorites are:<br />ChristyNugs<br />JackBlue<br />Northwest Nuggets<br />and I occasionally get from GreenOvenDoor, but usually only when they have their Sour Diesel up.<br /><br />Hope that helps. Again, I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re looking for US vendors but that&#039;s all I use so that&#039;s all I can recommend.<br />

The thing is I don&#039;t really want to get back into selling a lot. I wanted to get it b/c I often find great deals on great products IRL and could pass on decent deals to others and make money at it too. I wasn&#039;t sure or not how much business you did but it seemed that it wasn&#039;t a full time thing for you for the most part and I figured you could help me make a decision. The cost is kind of up there for a vendor account considering I will only be able to get rid of excess right now. I could actually probably make my bond back immediately but I thought to myself &quot;but then what&quot; ya know? Anyway. You answered my question to the point without me even asking it fully. Pretty awesome. Oh next time you stock some dmt let me know b/c that is one I&#039;ve really been interested in. Experienced way too much of other substances but think this could be neat. I&#039;ve never read about anyone having some ground breaking introspection with this. Can it be used as a tool like I do with shrooms? Thanks!

				Hello all,<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this is the right thread, but hopefully it is.<br /><br />I was wondering if someone, could lend me 0,64 BTC.<br /><br />The deal would be that I&#039;d pay you back at the end of the week, I&#039;m only asking, because there&#039;s a listing I&#039;d like to purchase, but the process of getting bitcoins might be too slow to get the bitcoins in time :/<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a lot to ask and I hope someone can trust me enough to lend that kind of money. <br /><br />All the very best to you all! <br /><br />~~sitamaja

I can pay back by Monday afternoon. I need to be enlightened by the spirit molecule! <br /><br />SR username is the same as here, rollbabyroll.

				Reposting ( Since noone ever checks previous pages ) <br /><br />HERE&#039;S THE STORY. And Below it you can find me, begging like a hobo.<br /><br />9/13/13<br />Woke up, ate, played some games, checked SR and SRF.<br />Get a call from an ex, she needs a place to crash for a few nights. <br />No big deal to me, cause im a kind person and always have room in my home for friends down on their luck.<br />Well, she shows up, we talk, smoke some weed and chill for a bit. 2 days go by like this, everything was going good till i went to go make my daily errand run ( Cigs, gas, look at guitars and such in the pawnshop downtown. ) <br />Well, me being the trusting person i am didnt expect to come home to find my entire room had been rummaged through, and my Ex was nowhere to be found.<br /><br />She managed to get off with my credit card, some old jewelry ( Gold chain, gold ring ) And not to mention my fucking weed ( honestly i was more bummed about losing my weed than anything...cause i was furious and had nothing to calm me down ) <br /><br />So I had been gone for maybe 4-5 hours. After doing a check around the house to see if she took anything else of value i checked my card balance and she had maxxed out the remaining 500$ from an ATM ( she knew my pin from when we use to date ) And she has perfect timing to...Cause my bill is due monday.. So, with the remaining money i had left, i went to the bank and paid off the debt and canceled the card.<br /><br />See, i had thought i set aside 200$ from my check to tide me over for food but must&#039;ve had my head in the clouds when counting cause i certainly did not. And it&#039;s not like i can go back to the bank and be like &quot; Oh hey, yea....remember the debt i paid off and that card i closed?...yea...im gonna need that back.. &quot; <br /><br />And now here i am, penniless and trying to come up with enough $ to tide me over till i get my next check @.@<br /><br />All i can say is...Im thoroughly disappointed in the girl, but i can&#039;t be too mad, She&#039;s a junkie and i guess when you still kinda care for someone, you try to see the best in them, and they only shit on your expectations.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209603.msg1536748#msg1536748">Quote from: ChronicDemon on September 14, 2013, 05:57 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ll be accepting donations for the &quot; ChronicDemon Is Broke as shit and needs food &quot; Charity<br /><br />All proceeds will go to me, for the event of feeding me...cause im broke...<br /><br />( Long story short, Someone maxxed out my Credit card so im stuck with top ramen and air for like 2 weeks so my entire paycheck aside from like 30$ went to paying the bill. And me, being quick to pay my debts, didnt realize how completely out of food i was till it was too late.) <br /><br />;3 If you&#039;re feeling generous please send me some coin lol.<br /><br />I only need maybe 40-50$, which will be enough to buy alot of hotdogs and microwave burritos to last me till payday.<br /><br />Can repay in 2 weeks when my paycheck comes in.<br /><br />No, none of this coin is going to SR or Drugs, It is going to my wallet in my pants, so i can go buy some fucking food and not live like a hobo.<br />I have a buyer already lined up whos gonna pay me Via Western Union once i have some coins.<br /><br />( Anything donated will be refunded in 2 weeks!, I&#039;m a man of my word as clearly shown in previous loans given to me by you lovely lovely people ) <br /><br />All donations can be sent to my SR account : AncientX0<br /><br />Or my Public BTC Wallet : 18FBCn9pC6G3db5FUNZULbnwvpbARPwHny<br /><br />I do apologize for coming to you guys with this. and it makes me feel pretty low that i have to ask for handouts to get food :c<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Good morning folks. I&#039;ve made a few posts on this thread and you all seem like a friendly bunch so I thought I&#039;d introduce myself. I&#039;ve participated in both borrowing and lending, but I see that this thread is also sometimes just for shootin&#039; the shit. So a little about me, I&#039;m a 33 year old male and I&#039;ve worked as a toolmaker for just under ten years. I live at the beach so I love any and everything to do with the ocean; fishing, surfing, kayaking, camping. I do like to party, I guess my d.o.c. is dope, but I&#039;m on suboxone maintenance so I don&#039;t do it a lot. I&#039;ll usually order a gram about every other week and get high for a couple days and that&#039;s it. Recently I&#039;ve begun re-exploring psychedelics. I live in the south so I can pick all the cubensis I want, other than that I really like DMT, MDA, MDMA, and a couple R.C.&#039;s. <br /><br />When I order I usually don&#039;t spend every last coin on charity buys, so I usually have some change in my account. You regulars feel free to hit me up if you&#039;re ever a few dollars short. I don&#039;t spend every waking moment on SR or the forums, so feel free to leave a PM. <br /><br />My doctor told me to stay away from coke. So I bought a fifteen-foot straw.&nbsp; -- Stupid joke I know, but I&#039;ve always heard it&#039;s a good way to break the ice. <br /><br />Alright, so I hope everyone&#039;s day is easy like Sunday morning.

I was meaning to take one...but took two, forgetting the increase of dose...I am 5&#039;10&quot; 15 stone...let me tell you that it was the best trip that I have ever had...the visuals were a bit intense. However, I am good at controlling my trips, turned on BBC Radio 1xtra and watched the show!!!<br /><br />Brobras, it was awesome...I have never tried acid...however, I am sure this would have been close...<br /><br />well I am finally out from under the bed and seem not to be as paranoid as before...now I am have jerkstore issues...I am going from 0 to asshole in 3 seconds...going to have a list of shit to talk to m dr about....<br /><br />Well back to tv/reading/lurking<br /><br />

I took 1800ug 2 or 3 weeks ago and thought I was having epileptic seizures, though my head stayed pretty damn clear. My GF took the same and she was in WAY worse shape than me. She shook non stop for 4 hours and puked her guts out. And we&#039;ve been around the psychedelic block. After that I did a little research on Erowid and found out a girl in my city died last year from 25i-NBOMe. The newspaper article didn&#039;t state the dose, but did say that they were pills. Her boyfriend who gave them to her was charged with murder. I guess in my state there is one precedent case where a kid was convicted for providing MDMA (supposedly) to a girl who died from OD. Careful with that shit bro, seems kinda unpredictable. As for me and mine, never again.<br /><br />---Just occurred to me, I think you gave me the loan for the shipping to get that 25i Boxy! It may have been 25c. One of those. By the way in my opinion 25c is way better than 25i. But you know what they say about opinions...

				Hey hey friends, afraid its the second time i&#039;ve had to do this :/ however once again my arrogance has left me pennies short on an order, and i&#039;d love to borrow&nbsp; 0.006 untill mid Tuesday time. <br />I paid last time for 0.01 also i&#039;ll look up the person who lent me the money months ago, via my PMs so i can atleast give some reassurance im not some low-life retard.<br /><br />Thanks in advance, throw me a PM please if you&#039;re willing.<br />EDIT: It was Intraterrestrial, who was kind enough too.&nbsp; <br />EDIT2: That seemed a bit blunt and straight to the point esque, im just kind of nervous as i don&#039;t fancy a drop in BTC and having to beg for more!

				Hello Guys,<br /><br />Sadly I hate borrowing BTC off people, but I have left myself short when I added the postage to my order. Sadly all my money has gone into this order until payday 2 weeks from now. So if anyone would be kind enough to lend me 0.04 BTC&#039;s I&#039;d be eternally grateful, I&#039;m no thief so would repay the favor.<br /><br />PM if your feeling generous enough, thanks again people!<br />Regards<br />PlanB

Peace?<br /><br />Boxy - Loved all those that you mentioned so I feel ya man. =) Good times man. I haven&#039;t heard of Boards of Canada. Going to check them out right now. Yeah you know I dated myself hardcore mentioning Tricky and Lords of Acid. haha&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh man. Have you seen the Chemical Brothers - Salmon Dance video? It&#039;s pretty damned funny. First time I saw I was on MDMA here this year. I don&#039;t know why but it always puts a smile on my face. The fish in an aquarium sing a song about the Salmon Dance and it&#039;s pretty trippy. For instance the puffer fish puffs up with air every time the bass hits. You should check it out. =P

				ehh.&nbsp; I dated myself right there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dude.&nbsp; I am freaking out cause I am getting to see tricky for the first time ever.&nbsp; Like I never thought this would happen.&nbsp; It&#039;s unreal to me!<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen all the videos from chemical brothers!&nbsp; Salmon can go to japan and back.&nbsp; I know that for a fact now.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d have to say the video for Star Guitar is my favorite.&nbsp; It compares to the whole theme of your surroundings with the music.&nbsp; I was on a train when I was listening to the song, and thought to myself &quot;something just fits perfectly here&quot;.&nbsp; Really funny when I got around to watching the video later.&nbsp; You must give it a try!<br /><br />Boards are pretty hit or miss with people.&nbsp; Give the album &quot;music has the right to children&quot; a try and go from there if you have the curiosity.<br />They don&#039;t really have any impressive video&#039;s but they don&#039;t really need them.

				never asked for BTC in almost my entire year of being here on SR but im in terrible needs of some weed and dont want to pay the 3800 id have to street value for a lb here...<br /><br />as of right now i have 11.4311 BTC and am trying to get at least a HP of BayAreaBudz as a qp would be pointless to me. that is listed at 11.7560 BTC.<br /><br />i just got off work and checked for caliconnect and his supplier apprently got robbed where so i was going to just grab a cheap lb from him since im sending in cash in mail tomorrow and soonest i will have money on my account is thursday but my weed drop point is only available friday and saturday so need to get this order out by tomorrow or the day after since to my area a pack has never taken over 3 days. i noticed the BTC went up in my short time of coming home from work and checking this page out and i am about to make a 45 min drive back to the city where my place is so hopefully the BTC goes up instead of down so i dont need as much of a loan. id be extremely grateful and would be in debt to do the same to the person if ever in need and would of course return the BTC as soon as i have the money on my account. i have over $40,000 spent on this website (will be over $50,000 easily as soon as this international pack lands and weed purchase are made).<br /><br />SR name is same as account name. if its too much its completely understandable, just thought id give this thread a try. thank you guys either way, would appreciate if no one flames on me like iv seen a few do to people asking for .04. a simple, &quot;that&#039;s too much to loan sorry&quot; is adequate.<br /><br />stay safe people !

				@DrWalter... :D Yes, Mr Postman brought me Nebula from webeweedgirls.

				Hey guys,&nbsp; I was planning on making a purchase as I got my bitcoins just now but due to the fluctuations of the currency, the amount that I have now is worth a tiny bit less than what it was worth a few days ago when I purchased them. I am 0.025 BTC short and would really really appreciate anyone that could help me out. I will definitely be returning the favor to others in the thread and of course the person who helps me out. I have over 15 transactions on SR and am constantly getting more BTC. My SR name is exactly the same as what I use here on the forums.

				Oh man. I know it&#039;s my own fault but damn I&#039;m sooo irked! I could have gotten what I really wanted but the &quot;free prize&quot; I won from a vendor here for 1.5 g of coke set me back 14bucks. This left me short so I got some stamps from a new vendor further setting me back. Since it was apparent I wasn&#039;t going to get any resolution from the vendor I was keeping my order in processing since he wouldn&#039;t respond to messages....planned on using that as a way to reduce his pretty little score. week has been fucked without lube. Thinking of fungus or 2ci just to get my mind off being pissed. Was hoping to get my stamps in but no luck today. =( sorry for the rant.

I had read it before that but never joined till my coins were taking hours, I think I msg Libertas at the time :) I&#039;m glad I did cause I found some great people here especially on the spare coin thread, where I&#039;ve mostly hung out since.

				Hey all, I stupidly didn&#039;t buy quite enough coin and am about .1BTC short of being able to make my order and was wondering if anyone could find it in their heart to lend a fellow SRer .1BTC or whatever you have laying around and can afford anything helps.&nbsp; I have never borrowed before but have lent and given coins to several other members in this thread.&nbsp; I can pay back directly and/or pay it forward when a buy more coins which will be a week from today (Thursday Sept 26th) at the very latest most likely earlier.&nbsp; My SR name is the same as my name on the forums:&nbsp; FollowIcculus&nbsp; Thank you very much!

				Thanks cannibal777 for the payback! +1<br /><br />*EDIT* I should&#039;ve mentioned that he paid back double what was borrowed. Granted it&#039;s a small amount, but a very nice gesture none the less.

Always better to double check that it&#039;s flu and not anything else. And if you have some take paracetamol to keep that temperature down. Lots of fluids, even though I know it&#039;s horrid puking them up it&#039;ll help wash it out of your system. The doc might give you an anti-vomiting injection and maybe some antibiotics if you need them. <br /><br />Feel better soon mate xo

				So I just drug my sick ass in to work (I&#039;m a toolmaker) and they took one look at me and sent me home without me even hinting about not feeling like being there. I don&#039;t have medical insurance so seeing a doctor is kinda expensive. Good thing my girlfriend works for an oral surgeon who is also an M.D. He&#039;s gonna see me on his lunch break. Free of charge!! It&#039;s nice to know people. So I&#039;ll probably be on the forums on and off all day today if anyone needs anything. If I&#039;m not here feel free to PM me (OSCT family). Thanks for the well wishes Mary and Remediless.

				hey guys, looks like I made a slight miscalculation on my order. I forgot to take into account the fees associated with buying coins and I am short about 20 dollars for my order. I will pay whoever donates the money 30 dollars back the next time I buy coins, which will likely be sometime in the next month. I will remember you, I promise. I used this service once before last winter. Boxofshapes lent me four dollars or something like that, and I repaid him two or three times the money. Idk if he remembers, but hopefully if he does he can vouch for me. send me a pm if you are willing to help me plz

				Hey guys. Thanks again for all the well wishes. I got called in to work for a quick emergency job then went and saw the doctor. Flu, just as I suspected. Ya&#039;ll my bones hurt so bad, like I&#039;m in methadone withdrawal. Oh yeah, that&#039;s an interesting story I&#039;ll share one day. I walked out of the clinic at 100mg/day after being on it for three years. Anyway, so I&#039;m just taking it easy waiting for it to pass. Feels like it&#039;s gonna be a long weekend since I&#039;ve got two packages scheduled for delivery Monday and one of them is from Marlitos. Almost hope one runs late, it always makes me nervous when I get a bunch of priority or express packages on the same day. One time I had 4 come on one day, I was sure LEO was gonna be delivering my next package, but it all turned out alright. Hope everyone&#039;s having an easy Friday.

				Thanks for the thought. I have been really fucking good at not over indulging but sometimes pills find their way into my mouth. I don&#039;t have any clue how they get there but I&#039;m beginning to think they have follow the homing beacon that Subs H implanted while it was coursing through my veins. haha. The only clinic I&#039;ve been to is called &quot;The Suffering&quot;. It&#039;s not the cool BDSM club you&#039;d think it&#039;d be either.

				I just thought I&#039;d ask as not everyone checks the time people have been on the forums or post history. Like, for example, I would no way lend to someone who made an account last week and has already been asking for loans in other threads. But I&#039;ve seen it happens - some people are so kind and generous I guess they forget to check these things and as always, you&#039;re right Box, the thread is a jar of honey for the baddies who WILL be back, all smiles and appreciative thanks but laughing up their sleeves as they slide away into the night. <br /><br />&#039;Doesn&#039;t apply to me at the moment as a potential lender though, &#039;cause I&#039;m keeping my account at something like 0.00001 BTC.in a bid to have a little break from caning it next week. We&#039;ll see how long that lasts, eh? ;) <br /><br />Anyway, have a lovely Friday evening/ Saturday morning my SR sugarpuffs xx

				I guess it&#039;s all personal judgement.<br /><br />I once loaned to a dude in the newbie section ( i think he had just a handful&nbsp; of posts), he turned out to be one of the most reliable persons i met here. gave him 3-4 loans since, still hasn&#039;t got above 65 posts i think.<br />So a shot in the dark from time to time can turn into a pleasant contact.

Granted it was only for like .006 btc. BUT, I didn&#039;t gift it to him and he swore up and down he&#039;d pay it back. It&#039;s NOT about the money, it&#039;s practically nothing. It&#039;s about being a big boy and paying your loans back, however large or small they may be. It could&#039;ve been an opportunity for him to get a loan repayment in the books.&nbsp; Oh yeah, this guy spammed to fifty to beg for change on his 53rd post. But I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, so I sent the change. He hasn&#039;t been on the forums since 9/3.<br /><br />He initially said he&#039;d pay it back in a week or two. So now it&#039;s been three weeks so I sent him a polite reminder about the loan. Here&#039;s what I got back: &quot;If you wanna go tell the forums that im a liar and nobody should lend to me ever again feel free, Im not gonna take loans anymore anyway and I dont give a fuck what they think anyway, and oh yeah, its just 5 cents (actually ~ 75 cents) and I will pay you back soon.&quot; I wasn&#039;t harassing the guy over change, just a friendly reminder, that&#039;s all. That&#039;s an example of that attitude that BOS was talking about that we don&#039;t need around here. He could&#039;ve just said &quot;It&#039;s gonna be xx more days&quot; or even &quot;can we just call it a gift?&quot; But no, he just had to shoot his mouth off.<br /><br />Does everyone feel me about it not being about the miniscule amount of money, but the concept of receiving a loan and paying it back? I&#039;m not gonna mention him by name in this post, but it&#039;s not too hard to figure out who I&#039;m speaking of.

				I don&#039;t know McRad but hasn&#039;t he got a shitty rep on here already anyway?<br /><br />I might have him confused with someone else but the person I&#039;m thinking of has worse neg rep than Jools and a history of vendors who won&#039;t deal with him for various reasons.<br /><br />Apologies McRad if I have you confused with someone else, if I haven&#039;t well, yeah, just prob worth doing a little homework on prospective lends, esp where they are more than just a couple of bucks.<br /><br />Good way, would be to see if they have someone who will vouch for their character, not gtee the loan but at least someone that has forum presence and can say &quot;I know him and he is cool, he won&#039;t let you down&quot; most respected forum peeps won&#039;t say that for someone they think MIGHT even not pay back.<br /><br />Just my thoughts anyway.

				Not very efficient if you need to get someone to vouch for you before getting a loan aye, it would kill the thread in days I think <br /><br />For your info McRad had 903 posts +114/-49 and been a member since January<br /><br />I was so polite to this cunt, the bit that gets me the most is asking what the exchange rate was, like fuck you&#039;ve had my money for 2 months at least pay back the btc amount you borrowed

				Too true RS7, I just cant figure some people out, I had written that money off because I msg him after a month and it took 3 more weeks for him to get back to me, but then seemed genuinely sorry so wanting to trust&nbsp; I do I did, then the pin then 5 more days, funny thing was as soon as I mentioned the shitlist he was sorry blah blah blah but never followed through ahh well.&nbsp; But Im very wary of lending now as I&#039;ve been burnt so many times by respectable looking profiles. I dont want the few to ruin it for the many but I can only afford to give away(loose) so many coins.<br /><br />Happy Friday, shit dude its the start of Saturday night here and Im off to the city tonight for a night of <br />debauchery&nbsp; oh yeah

				i guess you just got to accept the fact that occasionally people on here can disappear for a while. the guy could have been arrested or be in hospital or anything. that&#039;s just the way the game goes i suppose. although i&#039;m sure some of them do just fuck off cause they owe money too tho.

				Aye, you people are waay too trusting no offence, people who can seem really nice just switch when there&#039;s money involved. Fucks it up for the few gem of folk who are as honest as they come, is there a full shitlist of people somewhere? I guess most of the loans are for small amounts that people can afford to lose, but i hate it when disprespectful pricks get away with not only ripping soemone off, but not showing them the respoect they deserve for being generous enough to lend them money in the first place!<br /><br />+I&#039;d put money on a majority of the newbs who come on these threads begging for btc to be underage, shit it aint hard to get $5 worth yourself! <br /><br />Thats just my impression from skim reading a page or 2 though, may be completely wrong

				Fair enough if that&#039;s the case ! Some people could have real life problems, if that&#039;s what happened then I feel for those individuals. I will take back everything I said if it turns out to be something like that, but some of the people coming here for &quot;handouts&quot; have got the wrong idea. The people that are most active in this thread are doing a great job helping fellow roaders and having faith that the coin they lent will come back to them or get passed on, no matter how small the amount.

				Hi everyone :) I see we&#039;ve been busy lol. I personally feel that it&#039;s nice to be nice :) I never loan more than I can afford to lose but there&#039;s certainly a few people here who I&#039;d have no problem loaning a full coin to as I know I&#039;d get it back so to me it&#039;s been worth losing a few bucks to others as I&#039;ve met some of the nicest people here in spare coin thread :)<br /><br />Love you guys ;) (you know who you&#039;s are) :)<br /><br />Oh and I doubt safeonion paid yunalesca back, very arrogant a cunt!!

				@Mary, chronic and taz Oh no.....I feel your pain guys- I used to always roll a spliff before bed, smoke a 1/3rd then have the rest ready for when I woke up. I can&#039;t smoke weed now though, it spins me out after I took a year long break from it...opiates do it for me now though 8) ... life needs its rough edges smoothed out and some drugs are like a duvet for your brain. <br /><br /><br />@Cryngie that sucks on the coin not being paid back. McRad seemed decent, but those IMs say it all. &#039;Hopefully the debauched Saturday night cheered you up and was, well, debaucherous ;) <br /><br />@Doodoo79 For me it&#039;s not the amount, it&#039;s the principle. In real-life I&#039;d do anything for anyone in general and I&#039;m pretty generous, but hate it when people take the piss.<br />

We were out at a bar once and the barman started looking like an owl and once one of us mentioned it, we were all hallucinating the same thing and started laughing uncontrollably and then figured we needed to get our tripped-out arses out of there and home. That&#039;s the funny thing with trips- one of you can see one thing then mentions it and you all see the same thing, whether it&#039;s looking at your hands and having foot-long fingers or suddenly looking at the light and it turning into a 3D eye you all start seeing it - you get the picture. We walked through the fields to get back rather than the road the time with the barman/ owl and that&#039;s cool too going out and being at one with nature. I was never one for &quot;finding myself&quot; on acid, I used to like having a good 8-hour long laugh. But new places/ people can be a bit weird on acid especially if you&#039;re on your own and get the dose wrong. That said, I did some at a school disco once - teachers were there and everything but I&#039;d done it loads by then (started young lol) I only did half a tab and it was a real laugh once I&#039;d come up.<br /><br />Weight/ rough age / previous psychedelic experience are the factors to consider before we can help on working out the exact dose which is obviously imperative if you&#039;re gonna be on your own. Sometimes just a half too much can freak you out if you&#039;ve not worked it all out properly. <br /><br />If you go into it with a happy, open mind free of guilt and nagging paranoia or insecurities that could send you off on a bad one you should have fun. :D<br /><br />Oh yeah, can&#039;t remember if this is bollocks or not, but we used to believe that if you had a bad trip and drank orange juice that helped you come down. Maybe someone else can confirm if this is an old wives&#039; tale. The SR forum user &#039;Vanquish&#039; is the go to authority on trips.&nbsp; He&#039;s got a thread on the go several topics below this one if you have q&#039;s.

				sooo, is asking for $25 U.S dollars in BTC too much of a loan? If it is, i guess ill get off my lazy ass and just go to the bank and make a deposit. I&#039;d rather not though. If anyones feeling generous however, i will give you an extra 10 dollars the next time I purchase BTC, which will be in a few weeks.

				Hey guys. The tables have turned. I am now the one in need and it&#039;s for more than I&#039;d like to ask for, but here goes. I need .14 btc to complete an order. the only available shipping option is express, so that&#039;s the reason for the need of a loan. Hopefully I&#039;ve proven myself. Payback will be this coming Wednesday, no question about it. I will pay whatever interest the lender requests. I realize this is a substantial amount and hate to ask, but please guys, help me if you can.<br /><br />Again, Amount needed:&nbsp; .14 btc<br /><br />Payback date (definite): 9/25/13<br /><br />Interest willing to pay: whatever asked of me (within reason, say 10-20%)<br /><br />SR name:&nbsp; doodoo79

				I am truly grateful to be a trusted member of this community of kind, generous, humorous, and friendly people. Thank you all so much for helping me out with a $20 loan. That&#039;s more than I&#039;ve ever expected to ask for, but I&#039;ve been waiting for a listing to come up that always sells out within a day. Thank you for the opportunity to further show that I am a trustworthy person by paying the loans back. Good night all, and hugs and kisses in all your pink places!<br /><br />*edit* About an hour after I got this loan and placed the order, the listing was gone.

Definitely the strongest psychedelic experience I&#039;ve ever been through. I wish DMT lasted long enough to really explore around and sort it all out so you could bring back complete memories from it. I guess that&#039;s what Ayahuasca&#039;a for, but I don&#039;t know that I&#039;d wanna be trapped in that state for such a long period. If it turned on you you&#039;d be in for a shitty experience. Plus MAOI&#039;s scare me. But of course I have no problem injecting something I ordered off of the internet into my bloodstream!

New borrowers ought to build up a little trust and goodwill by making small loans before piling in and taking advantage of the goodwill here and absolutely loans should be repaid before new ones are taken out. <br /><br />It&#039;s such a wonderful thread and if people bear these small and basic rules of etiquette in mind when borrowing then it doesn&#039;t spoil things for everyone else.<br /><br />Someone hasn&#039;t paid me back for a good 8 weeks or more and they were so thankful when I initially made the loan, because it really got them out of a jam. And yet I haven&#039;t heard a dicky bird since... I don&#039;t want to put: &quot;nag scumbag for coins I lent them&quot; on my to-do list because it&#039;s long enough already...<br />

				If I can work out how to turn these paysafecard&#039;s into coins I may be able to pay you all back early :)<br /><br />Contemplating snorting 150mg&#039;s of DMT in several small lines at the peak of a 2cb trip instead of smoking it to get a bit more out of it. I would expect that the power of 25mg 2cb would reduce the drip somewhat, and the DMT will start to kick in fairly soon. <br />I&#039;m on a 3 week holiday from work and I&#039;ve got friends coming down, so I&#039;m trying to make the most of it ::)<br />How are you all doing tonight?<br />~D

				Just did some searching about snorting freebase dmt and it sounds pretty painful. But they do say it works good and the trip lasts longer with a gentler come up and come down.

If you find a good and anonymous way, let me know please.<br /><br />I looked into it once but couldn&#039;t find a reliable solution. I guess you could potentially make a fake okpay account, upload the psc to okpay and find a btc seller at localbitcoins who is willing to deal online with okpay? Not very useful and practical indeed ::). Couldn&#039;t come up with anything better. There might be some irc channels where ppl trade with psc tho, im not sure.<br /><br />I just use localbitcoins and pay cash now. Works like a charm.

				Hey folks! I would like to ask if someone could loan me .183 BTC. It took me three f-ing days to wait for my wallet to deposit my money. I&#039;m without BTC to pay for the order and the express shipping. I have people relying on my to have product available asap so that&#039;s why I always order express. If someone could loan me .183 btc I will be more than happy to pay you back .2 btc. But since I&#039;m quite new to SR (only been here a month) it&#039;s going to take some time paying back. I will have to wait for the product to arrive, sell it to my folks, deposit the money I earn on my bank account and wait for the damn btc wallet to complete the transaction. You will be compensated within three weeks. I know that this is a long time and most people aren&#039;t willing to wait that long, but I&#039;m saying three weeks because I&#039;m 100% sure you&#039;ll be paid back by then. Most likely you&#039;ll have the money back in two weeks but I&#039;m not making promises. Three weeks is my guarantee to you. SR name is &quot;Rasty1234&quot;<br /><br />Regards

Will not bother people in this thread any longer then. Actually I did not spam all the way to 50, I have some genuine posts. As I said, I&#039;m new here on SR, only discovered this website a month ago and I see a lot of potential of making good money since drugs are very expensive where I live. I&#039;m on my second order now on SR, but seems like my first one was a big failure. Either I was selectively scammed (vendor has a good reputation) or the shipping takes longer than usual.<br />But yeah, if people can&#039;t trust me then don&#039;t loan me the money. I won&#039;t be asking for now. If I can&#039;t get a loan the solution is simple. I just have to order a smaller quantity of this product.

I will have to wait for the product to arrive, sell it to my folks, deposit the money I earn on my bank account and wait for the damn btc wallet to complete the transaction. You will be compensated within three weeks. I know that this is a long time and most people aren&#039;t willing to wait that long, but I&#039;m saying three weeks because I&#039;m 100% sure you&#039;ll be paid back by then. Most likely you&#039;ll have the money back in two weeks but I&#039;m not making promises. Three weeks is my guarantee to you. SR name is &quot;Rasty1234&quot;<br /><br />Regards<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I would find it extremely hard to trust someone with 57 posts who spammed his way to that with such a high amount. But hey, you might be legit so good luck if you are!<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No worries. I understand lol. Will not bother people in this thread any longer then. Actually I did not spam all the way to 50, I have some genuine posts. As I said, I&#039;m new here on SR, only discovered this website a month ago and I see a lot of potential of making good money since drugs are very expensive where I live. I&#039;m on my second order now on SR, but seems like my first one was a big failure. Either I was selectively scammed (vendor has a good reputation) or the shipping takes longer than usual.<br />But yeah, if people can&#039;t trust me then don&#039;t loan me the money. I won&#039;t be asking for now. If I can&#039;t get a loan the solution is simple. I just have to order a smaller quantity of this product.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Good luck with your ventures man. Honestly though the first step is to get a new bitcoin service, 3 days is way too long to get some bitcoins from a wallet. <br />Invest a little in your business, and it&#039;ll pay off trust me mate. Depending on what you&#039;re selling, location and on you it should be fine if you can provide SR quality products locally!<br />~D<br />

Actually my wallet usually takes one business day but I guess there was some difficulties. I deposited money into my wallet on Friday last week. Didn&#039;t get my money until today, three business days later, five days in total. Gave some promises to certain people but they just have to accept the delay. And they won&#039;t be getting as much as promised, since I was f*cked over by the fluctuation of BTCs. Just placed my second order ever here on SR so it was a little less than I had hoped. My first order is yet to arrive and people are lining up to get this stuff where I live. I was stupid enough to make promises to them but it&#039;s not easy when you&#039;re new to Bitcoins and Silkroad. And drug dealing in general. I&#039;m only here on Silkroad because of economic troubles and with the prices I get for certain drugs will make sure I have a nice extra income on the side.

I actually got sent home from work today because I kept puking every 10 minutes. I got a gram in the mail from Marlo yesterday and it&#039;s just sitting there. I did a couple shots yesterday but really I&#039;m too sick to enjoy it. Got a gram coming from mrgood247 tomorrow, too. All this dope and I don&#039;t even feel like doing any.

You know anytime you feel like you&#039;ve got too much H just laying around feel free to mail it to me! You don&#039;t want it to &quot;spoil&quot; on you and waste it now do you? Haha. In all seriousness I do hope you feel better soon man. I hate being sick...just got through going through being a little dope sick and that was no fun. Finally got the stamps I was told were going to be 90mgs or more and nope they sucked and were at or less than 30mg&#039;s. WTF. I said in my review for it I was going to start calling his dope &quot;Midget Heroin&quot; since it had really short legs. Badump kiiissshh! <br /><br />On another note I have a party coming up this weekend and since I ate all the shrooms I wanted to bring I was thinking of placing an order with IndigoChild for a 10 strip of 25c-nbome and it&#039;s $16usd plus $3 usd for shipping. I have $13usd. I can&#039;t understand why standard mail is 3 bucks. Geez a stamp costs what like 47 cents now? So I went ahead and asked Indigochild if he could hook me up for what I have left and if he says he can&#039;t then I will come back and ask you guys. Hopefully I won&#039;t have to though. <br /><br />Still no update yet on the Charlesfloyd thing with me winning 1.5 grams of cocaine in his contest. I&#039;m going to give him a holla and see whats up. Hope you all sleep soundly tonight! (((hugs)))

I would like some bitcoins to order some blotter acid or maybe rolls and i do not currently have quite enough. I will be receiving a pretty good amount of money on October 1st so if anyone is kind enough to lend me some bitcoins that would be awesome and i would return the favor with a little extra.

				Just dropping in to say hey guys! I started to feel a little better this afternoon and was actually able to hold down some solid food, so that&#039;s nice. <br /><br />Someone had noted in an earlier post the recent surge of spam to 50, get free btc people lately. What&#039;s going on there? Until I get my loans out back in I can only help people on the thanks list. <br /><br />So since I was feeling better I decided to get into some of this dope laying around. Yay for me!! Noddin&#039; like a mo fo. To those of you that partake in the diesel, I just left a detailed review of mrgood247&#039;s gear in the heroin vendors thread. Not too bad. Not to bad at all.<br /><br />Good luck with your psychedelic experiment Dougggy. I can&#039;t wait to hear all about it.

				Hullo me luvlies, haven&#039;t been in here in a sec. How&#039;s the dog, did he hump the cat?

Should there be a bit of btc dust lurking in the corners of a wallet, that wants to go make with it with the dust in my wallet, who are we to stand in the way of their happiness? Thank you in advance, for your generosity and kindness, whether or not those two get to make with the dust fucking. I am in a peculiar mood, the wind is blowing from the East, and it is 13yrs to the day from when I got splatted and my entire path changed.<br /><br />

				Ah, that&#039;s what this thread is all about, and my moniker is the same, and good looking out. I will be repaying the first week of Oct., when I get paid. I usually double what was loaned, as that is not an unfair amount of juice for this type of transaction. <br />+1 karma as well, for you don&#039;t know me from Adam, Eve, and their lovers Stevie and Louise, but ya are here, and doing a good deed.

				Yes it is the same. <br /><br />I will say this: I love getting samples. But I also like to help people out. Vendors need people they can rely on to be honest and I&#039;m really not into being grouped into reviewer groups so much. So it&#039;s somewhat balanced I think. I have no problem paying for my drug of choice and buying things for my RL friends that want something. The thing is...there are so many shady folks popping in to make quick cash and fuck people over that it&#039;s upsetting. I am trying to find vendors That I know I can trust and I have a few so I can build a stable base without having to sell on here. I hope that makes sense.

				I just now decided to check all the entries in my Account History to make sure that someone had not paid me back that I had neglected to acknowledge.&nbsp; Since the log only seems to go back a little over a month and I never wrote any loans down.. I could only go by what was visible and it appears at this time that I have indeed acknowledged all repaid loans to date.&nbsp; :D&nbsp; &nbsp; If there were any prior to the cut-off date in the Account History who paid back a loan and I didn&#039;t acknowledge it, I truly appologize and you could send me a PM or mention it here in the forum and I&#039;ll publicly acknowledge it and +1 you..&nbsp; &nbsp;::) <br /><br />However, I also noticed that there have been 4 loans made in the past month that have not been repaid.&nbsp; Well now, two of them are shitlisted (BrotherFox and Locker) so... because I don&#039;t see the point in even wasting time trying to recover those...&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve mentally written them off and will not loan to them ever again.&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:( <br /><br />The other two are small amounts - both to people I haven&#039;t really had interaction with before or after the loans were made.&nbsp; These people are not on either the &quot;Big Thanks List&quot;, nor are they shitlisted.&nbsp; I&#039;m showing that:<br /><br />snooze borrowed 0.04btc on Aug 28<br /><br />jonnyboy91 borrowed 0.05btc on Sept. 11<br /><br /><br />Now, honestly, I&#039;m not hurting for btc at the moment and I&#039;m mainly posting this for two reasons.&nbsp; One, if anyone else is familiar with either of these people and has had either good past experience with them or bad, I&#039;d appreciate knowing about it for future reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;??? <br /><br />The other reason, is that in case either person listed above sees this post and has simply forgotten to pay back... that is quite understandable and if that is the case, then just let this serve as a gentle reminder.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, if that is not the case and for whatever reason it would be a hardship for them to repay, I would appreciate a post or a PM to that effect and due to the amounts being as small as they are, as long as they are posting/Pm&#039;ing in good faith, I would be willing to forgive the loans.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Thanks! :)

				Sure, how much you want doc?<br /><br />Aye its not bad :), had some IV phet earlier for 2nd time ever, id run out of normal sized needles though so had to use one of them fuck off massive ones :(. Still, got it and felt / feels pretty good, much cleaner than oral etc! Course ideally id have some gear/opiates but i&#039;m stuck on 12mg suboxone a day :(. GTA 5 is a great distraction though!

				Hi doc and CLK how much does it suck using a 5ml to whack 30units so gay the only thing i like is you dont have to draw back when you hit it thats a bonus. What is this phet you speak of? I got off the bupe before they put everyone on the suboxone and now im stuck on the fuel (vroom vroom) I had some pretty good gear last night/this morning got a good blink going but have run out of xanax again so off to the doc&#039;s thisarvo

				I find i still gotta draw back.. its just pretty much impossible. Fucking torture when you&#039;re rattling! Only thing worse is trying to use a 18g needle when you usually use 28s or 30s, its like knifing yourself repeatedly<br /><br />I only went on subbys 2 months ago, my gear habit was ridculous and they doi really do the trick, problem is you literally can&#039;t even have a nice blowout, they work too well, esp on daily pickup. Dunno why they put me on suboxone either, most people in uk are on subutex and the naloxone does fuck all! Rather be on these than on those green methadone handcuffs though, never met anyone who its even helped their habit with, they just end u using both.<br /><br />Phet was from a non-deep web dtch friend, came as a paste that stank to high heaven and had me buzzing off a 40mg bomb, got it a few months back and stashed it in a draw and remembered it at strt of this week and itd all dried out n turned orangey, so i banged some up in a pin and shot away! I swear i&#039;ve been left with a needle addiction rather than a gear one now. Its alright, nice rush and feels v clean, can still function etc and can ramble on with the best of em, so its top phet! I can see why some phet heads i used to know slammed it 24/7 but nah, its not for me. Not a huge fan of stims, like most i used to love them but started liking downers more and stims less, cause no comedown. Then you find out its addiction instead<br /><br />Fuck i want some opiates though, i bought some fent off subwu but it must just as he started having problems cause i never recieved owt and now hes gone. Street gear is cheap but shite, and stuff on heres v expensive! But probably worth it, havnt had a chance to try yet cause i&#039;m on daily pickup<br /><br />/phet inspired mini-rant

				I spent ages on subutex but they started moving everyone onto suboxone strips ive had suboxone a few times but it didnt hold me like subutex did. The naloxone is so you cant bang it even though I know plenty who do. Over here after 1month they give you takeaways so you only go every third day and after 2-3 months they give you a months worth so you only go once a month which is awesome. Im on the propper brown done not that biodone shit. <br />I also fear its a needle addiction so much more that the actual gear sort of like smoking is the movement of my hand/arm etc.<br />I had some pure liquid fent off a vendor over here and it was fucking marvelous 2ml for $120 and get 5 shots at 40units which is 400mcg which is more than enough to gouch out proper.<br />The gear on here for me is about the same as on the street but the strength is so much better from 2 of the vendors litterally 1point and im nodding not like street gear where i have 3points easy and am not even fucked

				I was just gonna add my 2 btc to the Subutex subject. I&#039;m on just 8mg a day and very rarely even take that much. I order a few grams of dope a month from SR and typically only get high every other week. It takes me about 2 days to start feeling bad when I stop taking Subutex. So what I do is place my order and once it&#039;s marked in transit I stop taking the Subutex. This always works out well for me because shipping is usually 2 days so by the time my dope gets here I&#039;m off the Subutex long enough to actually feel the dope. Also, if anyone out there bangs their Subutex, be extremely careful not to miss, and don&#039;t cook it either as the Buprenorphine is water soluble and all cooking does is breaks down the binder. As far as missing goes, I&#039;ve had several infections from missing when shooting subs. It&#039;s also hell on the veins and causes them to harden. <br /><br />If anyone needs anything I&#039;ve got some coin to lend, just let me know. Hope all are well this evening :)

				I&#039;m meant to be on weekly but my keyworkers been off for well over a month now, pisstake! +Drug serves are shit at getting replacements sorted.. so still on daily :(. I reckon il easily be able to to taper myself down, 8mg of the 12 i take at weekends and that holds me okay, not perfect but not really uncomfortable. Not gonna shoot one cause i&#039;m already getting nan unhealthy habit with needles, and i got no wheel filters and generally snorting them is great!

If it&#039;s an amount that will make little difference to my life, however, what does it matter if some of it is &#039;wasted&#039;?

I&#039;m on just 8mg a day and very rarely even take that much. I order a few grams of dope a month from SR and typically only get high every other week. It takes me about 2 days to start feeling bad when I stop taking Subutex. So what I do is place my order and once it&#039;s marked in transit I stop taking the Subutex. This always works out well for me because shipping is usually 2 days so by the time my dope gets here I&#039;m off the Subutex long enough to actually feel the dope. Also, if anyone out there bangs their Subutex, be extremely careful not to miss, and don&#039;t cook it either as the Buprenorphine is water soluble and all cooking does is breaks down the binder. As far as missing goes, I&#039;ve had several infections from missing when shooting subs. It&#039;s also hell on the veins and causes them to harden. <br /><br />If anyone needs anything I&#039;ve got some coin to lend, just let me know.

				Just in case you are tempted, like I was...<br /><br />Only give money to HEATFan if you are prepared to remind him when he forgets about it (and I am sure he will, ((he won&#039;t forget to ask though)).&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Having reminded HEATFan, you will then need to tell him how much you loaned him as he will be too lazy to find that out for himself and just arrogant enough to insist you find this out for him if you want repaid, because this is ok in his world.<br />Although You will probably be best off ignoring the cheecky fucker ;)<br /><br />I decided not to tell him how much, and to keep the cash.&nbsp; In case you wondered, he did keep the cash, bless &#039;im.<br /><br />(I don&#039;t care about the cash but prospective loaners should know).

				Evening people. I&#039;m looking to try GHB for the first time and I&#039;m .04btc short for postage. If anyone can spare some change, I&#039;d appreciate. I could pay it back (with a bit of extra) Wednesday at earliest and Friday at the absolute latest, as I&#039;ll be reloading then.

Maybe not on here but on SR i bet!

Sick of people who don&#039;t pay back, too much of it going on, seen a few people lose more than spare coin, it&#039;s depressing and that&#039;s not what it should be like.&nbsp; :( There&#039;s a great community in this thread thankfully&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				Good morning everyone! :)&nbsp; I was going to say something mundane like that I hope everyone is doing well and off to a good start to a new day - type thing...&nbsp; but I saw Mary&#039;s post... and well, Mary....&nbsp; you&#039;re part of &quot;everyone&quot;... and I&#039;m so sorry that you are sick and feel horrible :(&nbsp; Hope it&#039;s either something that the postman can fix..&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp;or...&nbsp; some bug type thing that won&#039;t last very long :-\ <br /><br />Anyway, haven&#039;t been around in a few days..&nbsp; &nbsp;just really was stopping by to say hi... and I&#039;m expecting new coin sometime in the next several hours.. I hope, but in the meantime, I&#039;ve got a whopping 0.0105 ($1.42USD) sitting there fairly useless all by itself... so...if anyone is in need of a miniscule amount...&nbsp; let me know!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Take care eveyone ;)<br /><br />Back in a while...&nbsp;

				Hello Mary and Foxen,&nbsp; hope you dont feel to bad there Mary<br /><br />So the package I tried to extend for 5 days yesterday and the vendor refunded me without talking to me or asking or anything, so it turns up today in the post. I feel I should contact the vendor and pay them but they did refund me without asking so now I have a refund to deal with so Im not sure if I should pay them as if they really cared they would have extended ahh shit I dont know <br /><br />On the bright side had 4 lovely packages arrive today and I feel like its my birthday/christmas

				High guise 8)<br /><br />I made all my orders and have some BTC left over.&nbsp; I was recently helped out (thanks Staind!) and won&#039;t be needing my extra coinage anytime in the near future so if anyone needs a small loan post here and shoot me a pm.&nbsp; Its better karma (literally not pretend internet karma) to have loaned more recently than borrowed.

I see OP has you on their good list. Hope you&#039;ve done your research or have cash, because this benzo taper is about to come to a REALLY abrupt end. haha. Let&#039;s see if Karma is alive and well....btc on the way.<br /><br />BTW...not one to post stats, but 21.6 btc is about a third of what i&#039;ve spent in two and a half years LOL. Best of luck, friend. Standby.

				Tree, .37 sent against all common logic and wisdom. Hey...nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? Went from .02 short of $66 benzo taper order to depositing .37 into the karma bank. Prayers and thoughts appreciated as I attempt to break this thing....<br /><br />regarding repayment, .37 +interest at your discrection. 1 BTC sounds a bit much, I&#039;m not a jew afterall (no offense jews, but my landlord is one and I had to serve him written notice to replace A/C unit from 1994 that was causing me utility overages down here in America&#039;s wang). Never tried MDA, PM for a sample if/when arrives. I&#039;ve always been curious to try. <br /><br />Everyone have a great day! 8)

				I need to get some 5-Htp - Never had it before. Also would like to get nooept and piracetam. Thanks you guys. <br /><br />I know it&#039;s going to be rough for her. Mary I thought of that too. Once the pain has subsided she might be willing to love one again. Shes coming over so maybe just being here with me will help. We&#039;re going to find a nice spot to bury her kitty. Better get my work boots on. I know that once I had to get rid of the only cats I have ever had I was crushed for months. Crazy I know but I still miss them and wonder if they are okay. My first one was just awesome and got me through quite a few rough years. Unfortunately I didn&#039;t have the money to take care of her anymore and I couldn&#039;t find a home for her so she and her buddy had to go to the shelter... =( Sad just thinking about it. Damn. New topic right?

				Tis the Monday of the rest of our lives...make it knit. (Winter is Coming)...&#039;ello me luvlies. I had a wonderful weekend with the wife. She has completed another year of existence on this ball of dirt hurtling though space, as of yesterday. <br /><br />Not to give too much away, but she doesn&#039;t smoke, drink, or really, do anything other than roll with me every few months. So for her b-day got us a bit of fiyah molly, and damn son, it was on!! Having a surgery coming up has put a damper on my running amok with her, but this weekend made up for lost time. <br /><br />So who is playing &quot;what&#039;s gonna be in my mailbox today?&quot; <br /><br />Hur hur hur looking for my sample from TSC, rubbing my furry little mitts together in anticipation!!<br /><br />PLUR biotches, good looking out for the gnomies in the wood.

				Hi all! Just went to place an order and I&#039;m just a little bit short. When I work out the difference, I am 0.0033 BTC short of being able to place my order :( That works out to be to be less than a $1 difference; I&#039;d ideally like to place my order by morning, so anyone that could help me out here would be a lifesaver. For any reference, I&#039;ve been on SR now for about 8 months, and staind has loaned to me several times. I&#039;ve always paid him back a little extra :)<br /><br />If anyone could help me out with the 0.0033 BTC I&#039;m missing I can pay you back that plus a little bit extra as soon as I get more coins, which should be within the week.<br />If anyone is willing to help me out, my SR name is greenbeanjacket :)<br />Thanks everyone!

Give her some time to grief, I wouldn&#039;t just surprise her with a kitten. Talk to her and make sure she is ready before doing that. It is crazy how attached you can get to your pets. It can be almost as harsh as losing a family member. Give her an extra hug from me :)

I don&#039;t trust people who simply don&#039;t care. I don&#039;t care if I was going to get a free kilo of killer coke and they were actually going to send it. No PGP. No address.

				@TheIllusiveDeus - every year is getting shorter... never seem to find the time... plans have either gone to naught... or half a page of scribbled lines.... hanging on in quiet desperation is the english way... time is gone.. the song is over... thought I&#039;d something more to say...&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Saw your sig and couldn&#039;t help making this silly post...&nbsp; &nbsp;I really just love that song! ;D<br /><br />BTW... tooth fairy is running a bit short of what you need... and also doesn&#039;t trade btc for teeth of people old enough to know DSotM :P ... but tooth fairy does lend what she can... when she can.... and expects to be paid back within a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; But go ahead and check under&nbsp; your pillow..&nbsp; should be part of it..&nbsp; 0.10 - hope it helps.&nbsp; Maybe you can get the rest from someone else?

				We were one of the unluckier ones. Most of our BTC are stuck in SR with 8k in escrow<br /><br />As such we are offering an investment opportunity in the way of either a loan or % revenue in the coming months over on sheep and BMR.<br /><br />Current sales volumes at the time of site seizure were around 1300 Euros in daily gross takings with around 1000 of that being net profits.<br /><br />With last month taking in 30,000 net<br /><br />If anyone is interested in investing in us any amount from 1000 euros to 5000 euros per person please contact us. We need to get a restock in and get the show back on the road.<br /><br />For loans we would be wiling to pay back loan amount and 25% interest in around 20 days<br /><br />and for % of earnings we would discuss individually<br /><br />Contact across here or herisson@safe-mail.netn-shut-650/

They are not coming for me.&nbsp; If they do, I will stand and admit to all of my actions. Intellectual honesty and accountability are not to be underestimated, friends. The cover-up is always worse than the crime. Whether or not you agree with United States Code is irrelevant. At the end of days, it is my opinion that we will be judged by our actions and intentions. Take moral inventory of yourselves....be fearless! There is nothing to fear but fear itself!!<br /><br />To those heading over to &quot;sheep,&quot; wow. Could it be more aptly named? I hope not.

				Hello comrades!<br /><br />I hope each and everyone of you is doing well despite these sad circumstances. We all lost way more than the contents of our wallets. I hope you will be able to overcome your material loss.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d like to invite the few remaining beneficiaries of my loans to donate the amount due to the following bitcoin address: 1DPRjkYXwmgvHo1vN4MmqA1bVfa226keMe<br />It is the &quot;Ross Ulbricht Defense Fund&quot; - **CLEARNET** www.rossulbricht.org<br /><br />If you do not feel like supporting this cause, consider your debt settled. I will not accept a repayment in any other form. There are probably only about 0.5 btc of &quot;legit&quot; loans outstanding, but I&#039;d love to see some of those kittens supporting a worthy cause. <br /><br /><br />I decided to keep using this alias, but solely for social purposes. It is not the smart thing to do, but making a new alias to talk to you people just wouldn&#039;t feel right. Honestly, I fell in love with this community and just hope we will eventually find a safe harbor. See you on the other side :).<br /><br />:-* :-* :-* imaz, boxy, mary, chemmy, purple, cryngie........................... :-* :-* :-*

NOT for anything illegal.. definately not any kind of drug...&nbsp; it was for a damn phone!&nbsp; I&#039;d placed the order at approx 3am - just hours before the site went down....&nbsp; but I won&#039;t bitch too much about that as I&#039;m sure that there are many others who lost a hell of a lot more than that in coin and probably quite a few their very livelyhood they depended on to feed their families &gt;:(&nbsp; &nbsp; And omg..&nbsp; DPR..&nbsp; maybe he made a few mistakes, but he&#039;s only human and for the enormous resonsibility he had to all of us as well as to runnng his business as smoothly as possible..&nbsp; imo, he handled it as well as anyone could be expected to for as long as he did.&nbsp; Of course, I don&#039;t know really what to believe.&nbsp; I suppose most of you did as well... read the Inditement against him that&#039;s been pubished all over the internet..&nbsp; it&#039;s very, very long...&nbsp; &nbsp;but unless I missed something, it read as if tying Ross Ulbricht to being for absolute certain the same guy as is DPR&nbsp; was for the most part speculation on the part of the Fucking Beaucratic Idiot ...&nbsp; oh, I mean the FBI Agent who had written it up.&nbsp; Actually, I got that from my friend who is a retired attorney...&nbsp; he seems to think that just going by the Inditement, that DPR has a better chance than it would seem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then again, he was aware of the SR, but didn&#039;t really participate much..&nbsp; so, of course he doesn&#039;t really know.... but it was a small ray of hope coming from a retired defense attorney&#039;s perspective.<br /><br />Anyway, sorry about the rambling...&nbsp; still trying to wrap my head around all this..&nbsp; &nbsp;But there are two things mainly that I&#039;d wanted to say...&nbsp; &nbsp;One is that I was honeslty surprised to see that the forum is still open - although most certainly it&#039;s being not only monitored, but controlled by the FBI..&nbsp; they must be hoping to find some more concrete evidence against DPR or something.. but I doubt that anyone is unaware of their presense, or that they would even if they could - which is unlikely - be writing any deep dark secrets that we wouldn&#039;t know about IF they even existed......&nbsp; But, nonetheless, I must admit that I was pleased to find that the forum is still here...&nbsp; mainly because I think that most of my &quot;going into shock&quot; over these sad curcumstances had a lot more to do with the fact that I have few people IRL that I feel as close to as I&#039;ve come to feel towards some of the people I&#039;ve met right here...&nbsp; nameless, faceless.. doesn&#039;t matter...&nbsp; I think that in a strange sort of way, I came to love some of you...&nbsp; at least I came to care about you and looked forward every day/night that I had a moment to get on here.. just to make some contact with some of the kindest people left on earth as it seems to me.....<br /><br />O.K. the other thing I was going to say... is that I just want to make clear that with all that has happened and that to some extent I&#039;m sure that all of us have experienced some sort of loss to various extents... and the last thing I want now is for anyone who might have outstanding loans to me to pay me back.&nbsp; So, PLEASE..&nbsp; if anyone was considering it...&nbsp; don&#039;t.&nbsp; I see a post a few down by staind where he&#039;s asking people to put their outstanding loans into a wallet to take up a collection for DPR...&nbsp; &nbsp;that is where I want anything owed to me to go as well...&nbsp; <br /><br />Now, enough of my silly rambling..&nbsp; &nbsp;just..&nbsp; &nbsp;*huge hugs* to Mary, cryngie, Kalli, ChemCat, Boxy, DantheIceCreamMan, staind, Defy, ImAz....&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried but am sure I&#039;ve missed quite a few who are so special as well...&nbsp; luckily, you know who you are....&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;:&#039;(&nbsp; &nbsp; :-\&nbsp; <br /><br />I got so much more to ramble on about... but I won&#039;t.. for now...&nbsp; think I&#039;ll do some reading instead....<br /><br />Love you all...&nbsp; foxen...

				My message to everyone in the SR Community who has been kind to me and especially to those who I have come to love and consider Family:<br /><br />First of all, even though it may come across this way..&nbsp; this is NOT &quot;goodbye&quot;.&nbsp; However, while I may change my mind once all the remaining shock and confusion over what all has transpired in the past week has cleared, I have decided, for the time being, to stop posting online... anywhere for an unknown period of time.<br /><br />I really didn&#039;t know where even to put this post, but decided on this thread as this (actually the original OSCT, but I&#039;m pretty sure that those still even on SR that I met there have moved to this new osct) is where I met those who are the most precious to me and who have given me something so important and so special that I don&#039;t even know what to call it.&nbsp; I know I&#039;ve mentioned several times that I don&#039;t have many people I can truly call friends IRL, and that is quite true.&nbsp; I believe that a lot of the reason for this is that I think I was born distrustful of people by nature, and from an early age, I came to distrust all facets of government... perhaps simply &quot;The Establishment&quot; might cover that better.&nbsp; But I also soon learned that rarely are people who they appear to be, even if you think you know them because you see them in person every day, visit their homes and vice verse, etc...&nbsp; they also can just as easily be a sneaky subset of the establishment..&nbsp; &nbsp;better known as rats, snitches, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that all people are rats, far from it.&nbsp; I am fairly sure that over all, they make up a small minority of the population in general.&nbsp; But still, there are other ways people have of stabbing each other in the back that doesn&#039;t involve snitching... and without going on anymore about all the things people may or may not be..&nbsp; I&#039;m just saying that for reasons known and unknown to me - at least on a conscious level, I keep to myself IRL, I rarely speak to the neighbors other than a casual &quot;how are you doing&quot; if necessary.&nbsp; I mind my business and I make a point to not mind the&nbsp; business of anyone else.&nbsp; And I guess that combo doesn&#039;t make for a very good atmosphere in which to make friends.<br /><br />And while I&#039;ve participated in various clearnet forums to a certain extent (never have trusted those such as facebook, twitter, myspace, yahoo360, and others that are/were commonly known), I&#039;ve never felt the kind of closeness I&#039;ve felt with some of you and I trust that you each know who you are.&nbsp; I&#039;m not mentioning names because for one, whenever I try, I never fail to leave out at least about 10 unintentionally... and for another, for whatever reason, of all the people here I&#039;ve come to truly care about and feel close to, still, there are some that I feel especially close to and I don&#039;t wish to sound discriminatory..&nbsp; would rather just trust that you know who you are.&nbsp; For as long as I&#039;m away, I will miss all of you....&nbsp; but it&#039;s those who have made me feel like I&#039;m actually someone (I guess is the only way I know to put it).. someone worth mentioning, talking to and replying to..&nbsp; You who have taken the loneliness that I&#039;ve long since become used to living with, away for whatever length of time I&#039;ve been able to be on here on the days I&#039;ve been able to be here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know how to come close to expressing how much that means to me.<br /><br />There have been occasions where I&#039;ve been able to be somewhat articulate - but obviously this is far from one of those so please bear with me as I&#039;m trying to communicate feelings I don&#039;t have words for through these damned tears that won&#039;t quit.&nbsp; Actually, I guess I&#039;ve said about as much as I can put in words regarding the feelings, but I have a couple other things I want to say... just because I want to say them.<br /><br />I&#039;m well aware that I&#039;m nowhere near as knowledgeable as many/most/all of you as far as technical things, in various areas of life experience, and probably lots of other things as well.&nbsp; But I do have some mediocre common sense... and the one thing that I believe has kept me &quot;safe&quot; for most of my life which is my intuition (gut feelings, hunches, whatever people call it).&nbsp; Even when my gut feeling is in direct opposition to what logic says, I&#039;ve felt a stronger need to follow the gut feeling/intuition even when it seems to make no sense while logic makes perfect sense but it&#039;s pull is not as strong for me.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m not making much sense to anyone reading...&nbsp; It&#039;s not for lack of trying.. it&#039;s just.... I don&#039;t know...&nbsp; but anyway, I guess I&#039;m saying this as much for myself as for you.... maybe....&nbsp; &nbsp;???<br /><br />So anyway, in regards to my presence online in general and on SR in particular, logic tells me that personally, I&#039;m probably pretty low on the list of priorities of the three letter agencies... if at all.&nbsp; I mean, I&#039;m not nor have I ever been a vendor/dealer/seller of anything on or offline.&nbsp; As far as SR, I&#039;ve made relatively few purchases and of those, the majority have been of btc, security related computer software and nothing that should get the Feds &amp; Co. terribly excited.&nbsp; Besides, they&#039;re running this forum now afaik, and if I&#039;ve somehow caught their attention in any way (though I highly doubt it), they know exactly what I&#039;ve purchased here, and that alone, says my logic, should remove any concern I could possibly have for my personal safety.&nbsp; And, I&#039;m noticing that more and more of you have already or are in the process of moving to BMR and or Sheep...&nbsp; and being that around the same time as I made my account here at SR, I also made an account&nbsp; at BMR under the same username as here - although I never wound up doing anything with the BMR account other than make like 4 or 5 posts in their forum - I figured that it&#039;s about time that I follow you guys/gals on over at least to BMR where I already have an account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Matter of fact, I just came from there.&nbsp; I saw many SR names that I am familiar with having seen in these forums and a few that are of those whom I&#039;m primarily addressing here.&nbsp; I did a lot of reading... still lots of theories going around about what really happened..&nbsp; although this bit is irrelevant for the most part to this post, as I ramble on, things just pop in my head and I mention them.&nbsp; All I&#039;m going to say now though regarding the multiple theories concerning DPR and if it was his fault, and/or theories springing up accusing various members of being undercover agents, etc..&nbsp; &nbsp;is that all I know for certain, and unless there really are some SR members with special inside knowledge, is the same as everyone else knows for certain which is that all the information that has been put out concerning the demise of SR has been supplied by the government itself and the media who writes their stories (except for the [supposedly] actual federal indictment that has been published all over the internet, which was written directly by government agents and only published by the various media outlets) neither of which can be trusted...&nbsp; So that to me equals NO real knowledge by anyone of what really happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, back to what I was trying to say....&nbsp; shortly after I made my one post today in BMR, for no apparent reason that makes any sense, my &quot;intuition&quot; suddenly kicked in and told me that it&#039;s time... NOW for me to get out.&nbsp; At least for the time being and to lose my username forever.&nbsp; This particular type of intuition that hits me in such a way has been the only thing in my life that has never let me down.&nbsp; I have always followed it even when I did not want to, even when all logic said otherwise... and while sometimes it&#039;s been years before I find out that had I listened to reason rather than this weird but not to be ignored intuition, I&#039;d have been dead, in a mental institution or some such type place I&#039;d rather not be - dead? well.. not ready for that yet either.&nbsp; So, as much as this makes no sense to me, I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t to you either..&nbsp; but as I said in the beginning of this post, I&#039;m not saying goodbye.&nbsp; But, I am saying that I&#039;m not going to be around for however long it takes until I feel &quot;safe&quot; to return... by which time I suspect this forum will be long gone ...&nbsp; but I will find you guys/gals wherever you are...&nbsp; BRM, Sheep, wherever...&nbsp; although common sense (intuition hasn&#039;t weighed in on this one) tells me that BMR is probably already in he crosshairs of the feds, as is probably Sheep (which I don&#039;t really know anything about other than that I&#039;ve seen a lot of people say they are going there as well as BMR)... although I hope with all my heart that I&#039;m wrong on this as I truly wish for no more harm to come to anyone.. anyone at all, whether I know them or not who is trying to pick up the pieces and carry on with their lives at a different url.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for me, while I must admit that it has been a good feeling just knowing that there is/was a place where virtually anything a person could want of the physical world is only a mouse click away... still, I could leave the market without much trouble... it&#039;s the forum..&nbsp; at least certain threads in it that I&#039;m having the real trouble with...&nbsp; the people who have made me feel alive, given me such joy and so much more... I&#039;ll miss you all terribly during the time that I am feeling that I must stay away.&nbsp; And when I do&nbsp; return...&nbsp; I meant it when I said that I will find yous..&nbsp; although I won&#039;t be using the same username, so it will probably take a while.. if ever for anyone to recognize me as being the same person as I am inside that you have gotten to know here.. as I am under any moniker. <br /><br />Until we meet again....&nbsp; nothing but the best of everything to all of you...&nbsp; my closest SR family and extended..&nbsp; and all...&nbsp; <br /><br />Much love,<br /><br />~foxen<br /><br />P.S.&nbsp; I have the link to the backup thread, but I&#039;ve read in several places that it&#039;s not safe to use it while this forum is still up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also read that regardless, the backup forum is active now anyway.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to go there as long as this forum is up and as long as I feel as if it would not be &quot;safe&quot; for whatever other reason.&nbsp; But, I forgot about that as I was writing my long message here, so just want to say that as of now, I&#039;ve not completely ruled out the idea of going there possibly sooner than I&#039;d thought I&#039;d feel comfortable posting again online.&nbsp; And...&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll probably be lurking without signing in... just to get a feel of the atmosphere and such.....&nbsp; &nbsp;again...&nbsp; love you all!

				This thread is great, but some people need to start putting their money where their mouths are. Save the sad stories. Everyone&#039;s got one, and most of em are bullshit. Me, me, me; I, I, I. <br /><br />Make the world a better place and go take a bum out to lunch. <br /><br /><br />Full disclosure: Sorry...benzo taper ended a little abrubptly and is an ongoing process. Luckily etizolams are easy enough to find clearnet. And still kinda bummed about the .37 lent to tellemetree on his 21 btc order....he&#039;ll get what&#039;s comin to him. Foolishness. That&#039;s how much i spend in one year. And i&#039;m 29 without health insurance and YES I used to want to be a fed. As in a federal employee. I have a bachelors. I am a certified air traffic controller. Uncle sam can&#039;t afford to hire me....I DONT CARE ABOUT THE MONEY. THE JOB IS SO FUN I&#039;D DO IT FOR FREE! I LOVE KEEPING THE SKIES SAFE!!<br /><br />If you are on silk road/sheep/bmr for distribution/making money, you will get caught not only by the feds but by the ultimate judge. For those in this boat tonight i solemnly pray. I pray that you realize that all the wealth in the world does you no good if you sell your soul along the way. But fear not....there is always time to change the path you&#039;re on.<br /><br />In the name of our savior, amen.

				Has nothing to do with people needing loans.<br />Just fucked up how it cant be promised to be given back.<br /><br />I will do 1 request for a lot. All that I dont need you instantly get back. Or if you can ship cocaine freebase/base prefferably high quality cocaine that would be very welcome too... Or speed/ghb.<br /><br />Loan required:<br />20 BTC<br />Payback: After 1 month.<br /><br />If there us a way I can assure you that you&#039;ll get it ack, give it to me.<br />Perhaps depositing to my bank would be safest, or an agreement between us and paypal?<br />

				FUCKING HAD on my first order on sheep. There&#039;s a guy impersonating UnderGroundSyndicate calling himself UnderGroundGuy. Same listings, claims he&#039;s a SuperTrips reseller just like UnderGroundSyndicate was. I know it&#039;s my own fault for FE&#039;ing but I FE&#039;d several times on SR when I was a noob and NEVER had a problem. Bad fucking taste in my mouth. Luckily I found RaverLove and he remembers doing business with me on SR so I can get MDMA from him and stay in escrow. Not once on SR had I ever had a bad buying experience. So just a warning, stay the hell away from UnderGroundGuy. God damnit.<br /><br />Cornelius I&#039;ll get you back late tonight/early tomorrow.

Anyway its not about me its about rebuilding this fortress with the rubble we have left.&nbsp; I&#039;m up for the ride.&nbsp; Love to all.&nbsp; I have one question... how are people still lending coins with no SR or am I in the wrong thread.. ? I am arent I? ok I&#039;ll go..<br /><br />&#039;ok now I&#039;m in the right place.. &#039; Mary! I made it - I feel like the only one here... hmmm cant get into &#039;new&#039; forums with jonnybones, but can get into old ones...what does this mean? I wouldn&#039;t have a clue. And why am I talking to myself?....oh yeah the drugs.. <br />
