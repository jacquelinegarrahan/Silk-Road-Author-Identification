				I really needed to get this off my chest. :X I made this account for the sole purpose of this.<br /><br />So here it&#039;s, I&#039;m 16 and I&#039;m GAY! Babam! Nice opening line, eh? Well as one might&#039;ve guessed I haven&#039;t &quot;came out of the closet&quot; yet. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the right time, but w/e that&#039;s not the point of my story. My story is about the fact that I can&#039;t understand why being gay is such a tabu in modern society?? I mean honestly, I have many guy/girl friends and it&#039;s so funny when people say how something is GAY or someone&#039;s a FAG and the jokes they make(unknowingly):&quot;You know, I really hate fags!&quot; or &quot;I can&#039;t think of a worse thing than being gay.&quot; I&#039;ll always laugh with them(more likely at them), because they don&#039;t know that they&#039;re ultimately insulting me. What really gets on my nerves though, is that because it&#039;s the 21st century and everyone&#039;s so &quot;OPEN&quot; with their sex life and people make jokes, act a certain way, but nowadays one can never tell if someone is gay or not(well there are those stereotype gays, but not talking about them). I mean even by looking at me, I think it&#039;s the society that has made me build a wall around myself and I&#039;ve put an iron mask on my head. Looking from outside, I&#039;m just a typical 16 y/o.I mean, I wouldn&#039;t tell anyone just because of the fact that it&#039;s an humiliation to even say it out loud. Maybe it&#039;s because of my age that I think this way, but as I&#039;ve understood, 90% of the people my age or 10 years older than me who are gay are also hiding themselves behind this wall and I think it&#039;s just sick and tiresome, because due to this I can&#039;t be myself with anyone nor can I say what I really feel to anyone. It&#039;s funny how I have plenty of friends, but no one knows the real me. The conundrum with this is the fact that I get these crushes(like any person), but I get them on my male gender friends and what this creates for me is tension and every time they say something like:&quot;Blow me!&quot; in an insulting tone, I always want to actually do it. It&#039;s so hard to sometimes hold myself back, because taking a leap of faith can end very sadly and I don&#039;t think I could ever commit suicide, but it could possibly destroy my personality. That is for the fact that, because I said there is a lack of gay(who admit it)people, what I fear the most is that, I wouldn&#039;t be treated the same or &quot;Oh gay, what do you think of my dress?&quot; or w/e &lt;.&lt; I don&#039;t really know what the point of this story was, but I really am feeling better with this out of my system :)<br /><br />Well thanks for reading. If you have any wisdom to share, then share away:) I&#039;ll be reading all the comments.

Doesn&#039;t religion preach tolerance and not hate? It&#039;s ok to have an opinion, but when you start judging people for theirs, thats when you have no room to call yourself a Christian.

You could have been born 50 (or 100) years ago, or worse yet, in the Middle Ages. <br /><br />Perhaps you should revisit your history. In medieval times, gays were frequently burned at the stake -- where do you think the term &#039;faggot&#039; came from? It came from the bundle of sticks that were piled next to the stakes to be used as fuel to roast the victims alive.&nbsp; If the judges were feeling particularly merciful, they would place little barrels of gunpowder attached around their victim&#039;s necks; the idea was for the gunpowder to explode, decapitating&nbsp; the victim, and sparing them a far more gruesome (not to mention painful) death by being burned alive.&nbsp; Even after death, they would not be given a conventional (Christian) burial -- rather, their remains would be buried at a cross-roads, where they would be&nbsp; walked upon or trampled upon by passing travelers. <br /><br />Even in more recent times, homosexuality was a criminal offence. You might wish to read about Oscar Wilde -- he served time in prison, and if memory serves, it broke him -- he was never the same after he came out of prison.&nbsp; Homosexuality was actually in the Criminal Code of Canada until 1969 -- if convicted, you could actually be sentenced to life in prison.&nbsp; In the 1950s, Canadian civil servants were subjected to investigation by the RCMP, using what was referred to as the &quot;fruit machine&quot;. (I&#039;m not making this up -- Google it, if you don&#039;t believe me. The &quot;fruit machine&quot; was a machine that was supposed to root out homosexuals.&nbsp; Other characteristics of alleged homosexuals were such things as, &quot;driving a white automobile.&quot;) <br /><br />Needless to say, things have changed here, now. Gays and lesbians can legally marry in Canada -- if someone had told me 20 years ago that this would be the case, I would have laughed in their face, never believing it was possible.&nbsp; While full acceptance still isn&#039;t there, things are one helluva lot better than they used to be. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />silly Guru....we all know that homophobes don&#039;t read....

				I&#039;ve got no clue whether OP is for real or not, but I don&#039;t think &quot;coming out on an anonymous board&quot; is really a contradiction as some have stated. OP might just be testing the waters, as in, see how it feels to say it out loud. I can also see how SR might be a venue that offers some sense of comfort.<br /><br />So, OP, if you are 4 real. Listen, people discriminate/hate against other people for all sorts of reasons. Whether that is being gay, being of color, being bald, being fat, being smart, being dumb.....and so on and so forth.<br /><br />That&#039;s not unique to being gay. Haters be hating. All you need to know is that you are who you are, and the only one that needs to be okay with who you are is you yourself.<br /><br />Take the advise that was given in here. There are boards out there with plenty of people in the same boat as you. Community can be the biggest weapon against ignorance and bigotry, it&#039;s 2012, there is no need for you to go it alone, but this might really no be the right place for it.<br /><br />@theignorantbigotteddumbfuck<br /><br />You&#039;re just a hate-filled little dumbfuck. Either that or you are in the closet yourself lol...

				By researches and wiki, you probably born gay. I&#039;ve been looking for a lot of information with the years/ It can be developed with the years like some guys in prison and such, but they will not become 100% gay, but more like bisexual=love women and men. My suggest will be to stay in the closet until you finish school. Kids can be very mean... Wait till university or something. Trust me on this. I&#039;ve seen how gays been &quot;treated&quot; once they&#039;re in school/after - let&#039;s say at the age of 21... HUGE DIFFERENCE. No one will really care about that<br /><br />That being said... Barney Stinson is gay, and he is AWESOME.<br />Sheldon from the Big Band is gay... Very down to earth person, humble and nice.<br />The guy from modern family... (Only one of them)<br /><br />At first, it&#039;s hard for people to accept that you &quot;think&quot; and feel different and realize you breath the same air and live life on the same planet with them, but after a while they just seem to not care about that. After all, with all the network and awareness to all &quot;kinds&quot; of people, cultures and habits, nothing seems to be a big deal. It may be hard for your family to accept that one day, weather if you&#039;re gonna tell them or not, they do have instincts, they probably wait for your marriage etc, but you got to make your own decisions. They gave you life, but it&#039;s not in control. I&#039;m sure no one would like to be gay at the first place (at least most of the people).<br /><br />Sincerely wish you the best, and keep on with your life... Get new hobbies and develop yourself.. No need to stick around straight guys who probably won&#039;t understand but judge you.

				Ok.. I&#039;ve read this whole thread and I think clarifications are in order.<br />So here they&#039;re...<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why I even mentioned my age, because I think that many posters have took the role of &quot;a mature adult&quot; and started showing me how it could be worse or how it&#039;s a &quot;sin&quot; to be gay. I personally think it&#039;s devastating(but understandable due to the trolls that come to this forum) to read 90% these comments being about my age, how it could be worse or how I should be ashamed. I also want to thank all of You who have said things that are to the positive side. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46124.msg489534#msg489534">Quote from: Limetless on September 27, 2012, 04:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Is it just me that&#039;s confused about the fact the OP is coming out on an anonymous forum which is sorta a contradiction?

				sorry, i didn&#039;t read your whole post, OP but it was written in tweaker form and I can&#039;t handle that.&nbsp; at least next time split it up into paragraphs.<br /><br />anyway<br /><br />you&#039;re young, and kids are idiots.&nbsp; forget all the opinions and comments you hear from kids your own age about homos and homosexuality in general.&nbsp; you&#039;ll find that as you get older, any reasonable person isn&#039;t going to care that you&#039;re gay and its not really a big deal.&nbsp; i&#039;m a heterosexual married man but i&#039;ve had many gay friends over the course of my life and thought little of it.<br /><br />however, if you live somewhere that gays are more persecuted and not tolerated, I strongly suggest trying to make a move somewhere more progressive in a couple years.&nbsp; if you&#039;re in the USA, go for NYC, Boston, Chicago, any city on the west coast, or Canada.<br /><br />keep strong, dude.&nbsp; the things that make you different are the things that will make you great.

				People like people who similar to them or have things in common, that&#039;s how it is... I wouldn&#039;t want to hang out with gay people, not because I hate them, I don&#039;t, but I believe almost every straight has this fear of gays will try to make a move, so there always that distance. For example, I have worked with gay guys, and when I opened myself with them, like a regular friend, one of them jumped on it and shared things I don&#039;t like to hear, like you know...&nbsp; I never want to experience something with men, and I believe being a lot with gay dudes is not healthy for straight guys. It&#039;s easy confessing yourself here in the forum where no one really knows you, but it&#039;s a step further and I&#039;m sure it will make you feel better seeing how most people here are open minded and accept &quot;the other&quot;, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, it doesn&#039;t matter. Be a human first. If you were a terrorist or a Nazi, or some Illuminati/Government member I would say fuck you and wish you to live in miseries, but you aren&#039;t, so I wish you the best :)

				From a Freudian perspective, OP&#039;s mother didn&#039;t represent a suitable role model of a mate when he was a wee little lad so he didn&#039;t really focus on girls as much. <br /><br />Also I&#039;m pretty sure being gay isn&#039;t possible only from birth, at least from women.
