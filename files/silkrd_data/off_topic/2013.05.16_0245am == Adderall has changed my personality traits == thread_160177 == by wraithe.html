				I have been taking adderall for 5 months now about 45mg IR a day orally.&nbsp; Among the many benefits most people know about it focus, energy, sex drive, etc I have experienced some others<br /><br />Many of my recessive character traits. <br />&nbsp;I was always a Passive-Aggressive guy, now I am Overly Aggressive(i understand amphets can trigger rage/irritability)&nbsp; <br />I was always a cautious person, now I am doing things and taking risks I never would of imagined.&nbsp; Not in a &quot;ill skydive now way&quot; more in a Sociopath way lol&nbsp; I am becoming more narcissistic. <br />I have lost any filter I used to have.&nbsp; When I would have a conversation with someone and I did not like what they were saying, or it was bullshit, I would just go with it.&nbsp; Now I call them out everytime.&nbsp; <br /><br />Not only do I feel this has benefited me in business, but I no longer resent some of my flaws I use to have as those flaws are changing.<br /><br />Either way I figured I would rant and see if anyone else has noticed this.&nbsp; At first I was just more irritable but it has evolved

				So you like the way you are now?<br /><br />Mind you it&#039;s just an effect of the drug. If you stop taking it you will turn back to your original self.<br /><br />What you have described above (risk taking, no filters etc.) are also known effects of dopamine-increasing stimulants :)

				I was on it for about 6 months.&nbsp; After getting off of it, it took a long time before I could get self motivated again.

				I remember Adderall making me super horny a couple of times I took it. I jerked off like 6 or 7 times within an 8 hour period of taking it.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to get some more but it&#039;s a bit hard to find in the part of the world I am living. All that&#039;s available here is straight meth, and I&#039;d rather not take the risk of getting caught buying it.
