				well, it was a stupid move. research and start small. hope to balls your vendor does a good job.<br />there is no way in hell you can claim personal use, that&#039;s some heavy trafficking.<br />after/if you receive, lay low. don&#039;t go telling all your friends and selling it at street corners.<br /><br />if this was your first buy, you are especially stupid and should punch yourself in the asshole.<br /><br />better luck next time.

				I have made lots of purchases on silkroad but this is by far the largest, I have done research but theirs not a lot of info what kinda trouble some one in my situation would get in. The vendor I ordered from has great packaging so I am fairly confident that it will come through ok and I ordered it to two different PO boxes.

				If you&#039;re under 18 and you get caught your criminal record will be erased at 18, trust me i have been through this before. It is much trouble if you are over 18 trust me, it takes around 7 years to clear criminal record when you are over 18 in Canada !

As i said earlier you&#039;re under 18, the worst thing they can do is placing you in social centers for minors this is not a prison, you will play basketball and educative games ..&nbsp; 8)
