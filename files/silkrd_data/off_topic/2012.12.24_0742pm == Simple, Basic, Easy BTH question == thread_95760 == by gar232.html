				Hello,<br /><br />So obviously I am new to SR and all that jazz. I am an opiate user, strictly heroin these days. I was just cruising the site to check out the prices / quality and wow! This stuff is expensive. I am a daily user, over 15 years experience, but I keep a normal regiment, I work, pay my bills etc. So I don&#039;t have a ton of play money.<br /><br />My question is: Is the quality of the hop here really that much better? I&#039;ve had #3 (I hate the pins &amp; needles) #4, east coast white. Where I live now all you can get is BTH, but the stuff I get is pretty quality, a typical shot I do .1 for a good rush and feel good, .2 I&#039;m nodding bad (took years to find a dealer who sold &quot;small sacks&quot; and wasn&#039;t crap). $80-100/g is standard price (damn Oxycontin kids drove up the market haha). Should I stick to what I know, or as I said is the quality really that much better that I would be saving any money? Or is this really for people that don&#039;t have connects/dry spells?<br /><br />Thank you in advance. <br /><br />

				IM A DAMN OXYCONTIN KID!!! lol... Really if you can get awesome BTH for that Price i would say stick with it.. The guys on here are wanting 300 + for a Gram of good shit.. Iv gotton BTH a few times and its taken a whole .2 to feel the rush.. Hell i got a GRAM from one vendor and did the whole thing in a couple hours.. Then had some #3 and felt NOTHING!! so yea Id say stick with your guy&nbsp; for sure..
