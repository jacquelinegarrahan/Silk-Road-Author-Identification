No individual, group, or government may initiate force against any other individual, group, or government. Our support of an individual’s right to make choices in life does not mean that we necessarily approve or disapprove of those choices.<br />Source: National platform adopted at Denver L.P. convention , May 30, 2008<br /><br />Repeal all laws against homosexuality<br />We advocate the repeal of laws regarding consensual sexual relations, including prostitution, and the cessation of state harassment of homosexuals; [and] the repeal of laws prohibiting the distribution of sexually explicit material.<br />Source: National Platform of the Libertarian Party , Jul 2, 2000<br /><br />Right to complete freedom of expression includes pornography<br />We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of individuals to dissent from government itself. We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media, including, but not limited to, laws concerning: Obscenity, including “pornography.”<br />Source: National Platform of the Libertarian Party , Jul 2, 2000<br /><br />Redress the wrongs of the U.S. towards the Indians<br />The rights of American Indians have been usurped over the years. We support the following remedies: (1) individuals should be free to select their own citizenship, (2) Indians should have their property rights restored, including rights of easement, access, hunting, and fishing, (3) the Bureau of Indian Affairs should be abolished leaving tribal members to determine their own system of governance, and (4) negotiations should be undertaken to resolve all differences between tribes and government. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/libertarianism.html#B4<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">B4. What is the libertarian position on art, pornography and censorship?<br /><br />Libertarians are opposed to any government-enforced limits on free expression whatsoever; we take an absolutist line on the First Amendment. On the other hand, we reject the &quot;liberal&quot; idea that refusing to subsidize a controversial artist is censorship. Thus, we would strike down all anti-pornography laws as unwarranted interference with private and voluntary acts (leaving in place laws punishing, for example, coercion of minors for the production of pornography). We would also end all government funding of art; the label of &quot;artist&quot; confers no special right to a living at public expense.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				&quot;the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;— John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (1859) <br />Love it !!<br /><br />We are talking about &#039;real world&#039; secular harms to living persons here, not about harm by offending some moral code or deity.<br /><br />Mill offers only one exception which can be applied across multiple circumstances and that is of a situation where a demagogue is outside a corn dealers house and inciting the crowd to violence against the corn dealer by repeatedly stating similar to that corn dealers are the cause of the starving masses because of a practice of price fixing.<br />In this instance Mill states it is acceptable to punish the words of the demagogue as there is a clear and immanent danger to the corn dealer.
