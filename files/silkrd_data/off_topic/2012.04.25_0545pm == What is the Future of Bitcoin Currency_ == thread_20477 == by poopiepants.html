				Ok. Even better idea. We turn your small island nation (bought with BTC) into a haven and we use my nuclear weapon (bought with BTC) to protect ourselves and we become the smallest ever nuclear state and we hire a bunch of mercenary soldiers to protect us (paid for, of course, with BTC) and we set up the only BTC exchange that wont fuck you for money laundering.<br /><br />Job&#039;s a good&#039;un!

				Bitcoins are probably going to become the cypherpunk answer to the Petrodollar. Ever since Richard Nixon convinced the Saudis (And thus OPEC) to price their oil exports in USD in exchange for being military clients/protectorates of the US military superpower there has been a two track impetus towards the US Dollar being the dominant world currency.<br />&nbsp; The first track is the Petroleum-Military Axis. The second is the Banking/Liquidity Axis. These two intersect to yield US global dominance. <br />&nbsp; The Petroleum-Military Axis goes like this.&nbsp; The US arranges for the lion&#039;s share of the Old World&#039;s easily tapped petroleum to be priced in USD exclusively. Via it&#039;s military clients in the Gulf and the Mideast (ahem.. Israel) it also keeps regimes in power that will not disturb this comfy arrangement. How does this help the US? Well.. when oil is priced in USD it forces petroleum importing countries to maintain lots of positive USD reserves so they can purchase the energy they need. And this has the effect of spreading the inflationary effects of US Government Debt out to other countries (which in turn provides money the USA can use to build up it&#039;s military machine). This is basically a modern day version of looting the country you conquer to pay your own soldiers during the campaign.<br />&nbsp; The Banking/Liquidity Axis goes like this. Everything $$ clears through NYC (and London) banking wise. And the US has a giant internal economy. Which means the amount of dollars sloshing around (and the amount of bonds and transfers that can go on without playing games with currency values) is GIANORMOUS.&nbsp; So as long as the US has a huge internal economy this encourages bond issues and stocks and such to happen in NYC. The US can then use this dominance to create trade rules and banking regulations world wide that hamstring competitors. Sortof the latterday equivalent of pre-emptively robbing and looting your neighbors to starve to death the children that might become soldiers to fight you 20 years from now.<br /><br />&nbsp;How does Bitcoin fit into this?&nbsp; &nbsp;Well bitcoin has a &quot;petro&quot; to it&#039;s &quot;dollar&quot;... <br /><br />&nbsp;IT&#039;S CALLED DOPE.<br /><br />&nbsp;By &quot;dope&quot; I mean &quot;illegal stuff&quot;.. transactions that are &quot;outside the bounds&quot;. Bitcoin is absolutely marvelous at one closely related set of qualities.. all the shit you need to work outside the box of state control. It&#039;s not tied to any national entity, it has no central bank, it is so stealthy it might as well be truly anonymous. It will be deflationary, or at least non-inflationary once it&#039;s mature. It can be stored and generated outside of typical&nbsp; banking institutions controlled by state actors. It has no military backup, doesn&#039;t need any, doesn&#039;t have a minimum transaction size. Oh and you can store it all in your head if you have to ( google &quot;Bitcoin Brainwallet&quot; ). In other words.. it&#039;s a hell of alot like DRUGS.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s basically &quot;the Dopeman&#039;s Dollar&quot;. <br /><br />&nbsp;I expect the future of the Bitcoin currency is to be THE black market token of value in 2 decades. And if the world&#039;s goverments ever DO trip and stumble over their monetary and geopolitical stupidity... Bitcoin (or maybe it&#039;s successor systems) will be waiting in the wings.<br /><br />&nbsp;So if you want that island gents... I suggest you vend.. and instead of cashing out for dollars or whatever.. hang on to your Bitcoins.. or better yet.. reinvest those Bitcoins by buying dope you sell IRL, then convert that money into more Bitcoins and repeat the process.&nbsp; The more value the blackmarket injects into Bitcoin, and the higher the monetary velocity of the Bitcoin .. the more dominant OUR money becomes.. because our money.. is the Dopeman&#039;s Dollar . The Bitcoin.
