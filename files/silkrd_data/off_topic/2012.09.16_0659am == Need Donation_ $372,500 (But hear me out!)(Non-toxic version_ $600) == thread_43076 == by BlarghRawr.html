				That is, by my estimate, the price to purchase roughly 61 pounds of the rare metal, osmium. Osmium is the heaviest natural metal on earth. 61 pounds is how much osmium will fit in a small, flat rate USPS box. Those are allowed to ship for anything under 70 pounds.<br /><br />What I want to do with this amount of osmium is set up a chain of people, each of which only knows who they are to send it to, once they get it... but a chain of people that will simply ship and re-ship this osmium through the postal service. Just to fuck with the postal service.<br /><br />I&#039;m stoned and this is the greatest troll in existence.<br /><br />Edit: Or since that&#039;s horribly unsafe, bismuth! With that, just $600 is all that I would need. Not really an epic-troll, sadly...<br /><br />Oh well. It was a good idea, at least.

But it is a toxic metal... an pure osmium sounds like it&#039;s even worse, actually.<br /><br />Guess I can&#039;t take donations for this, after all. :( Bismuth is the heaviest non-toxic at 26.5 pounds. But that hardly seems worth it...

				WTF?<br /><br />Why screw with the people who are delivering good recreational drugs to you? USPS serves me very well. India Post is very slow but always comes through. Those people work hard. What are you thinking?
