				I am an american, but i do not use the usd feature.&nbsp; I shop in btc, and do the conversions in my head.&nbsp; It&#039;s simple math.&nbsp; If doing simple math is too hard, maybe the drug trade isn&#039;t right for you.&nbsp; It&#039;s no different than using simple fractions to break down and resell your goods, and basic multiplication to know your end cash out.&nbsp; But, that&#039;s just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.

				I don&#039;t know what to say. You _choose_ to view prices in bitcoins, and to multiply what you see in your head for every price you see? You actually get off on wasting your time, mentally working out costs when there&#039;s a feature that does it for you automatically? Madness.<br /><br />I never said the maths wasn&#039;t simple. It&#039;s simple and it&#039;s tedious. It takes time. It is a waste of time when a computer could do it for me. But you wouldn&#039;t understand that as you said yourself, you choose to waste time.

				Its kinda simple.<br />Price is 8 bitcoin for product.<br />Rate is £7 per bitcoin.<br />Equals £56 for said product.<br />Not as time consuming as you would think.&nbsp;

				Did I say it was complicated? No. Read my posts again, I said it was tedious. The exchange rate is currently 1 BTC = £6.45, most productx aren&#039;t round bitcoin prices either, so your average calculation would look something like <br /><br />Price is 3.74 BTC<br />Rate is £6.45 per BTC<br />Equals £24.123<br /><br />The fastest way to do this is by calculator (unless you&#039;re rain man). And this takes a lot of time. If you round to the nearest bitcoin and GBP like you&#039;re doing you could get a very inaccurate answer. E.g. the above equation rounded to 4 BTC and 7 GBP/BTC makes it 28 GBP, that&#039;s way off. That way is not an option, it must be done properly on a calculator, and this takes time.

				I also have to factor in bitinstant deposit rates, blockchain transfer tips, and gas to drive an hour each way to make a deposit.&nbsp; Rounding up doesn&#039;t pose a problem, it covers the rest of the big picture.&nbsp; And no, i don&#039;t have to waste my time with a calculator, i&#039;ve played the game for a long time.&nbsp;

				The rounding error changes depending on product price and bitcoin exchange rate so your statement about it being constant and covering costs is ridiculous.<br /><br />If you can quickly multiply two four digit numbers without a calculator then you&#039;re a special talent. Somehow I think you&#039;re just bullshitting though.

				So round it up to nearest whole figures when purchasing coin for what you want, a bit of extra bitcoin could come in handy when the rates keep changing. <br />But I see where your coming from we need this implemented to €+ £ etc, not everyone is american.<br />It annoys me too, I usually have the calculator open on the desktop to see if its a ripoff or a good deal.&nbsp; But I usually just do it in my head to get a rough idea. I even see how much a gram would work out when buying 250gram etc.. And that you would most definitly need a calculator.

				We all have different skills and math isn&#039;t everyone&#039;s forte.&nbsp; So get off your high horses and celebrate your differences and post something useful, like:<br /><br />There is a GreaseMonkey script made by a user on SR that converts BTC to GBP.&nbsp; Not only that, if the posting on SR has a milligram amount, the script attempts to give you a price per milligram for comparison.&nbsp; I found the price/mg didn&#039;t work well because the postings are not standardized.&nbsp; If the posting says 10mg #10, then it thought the price was for 10mg, not 100mg...<br /><br />Here is the link:&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28478&nbsp; (big thanks to Cbrdck for building the script)<br /><br />Good luck, I have no use for GBP, so I uninstalled it.&nbsp; Oh, I&#039;m first generation American with dual Scottish Citizenship, but have lived in America my entire life.&nbsp; Am I still allowed to post in this thread?

				Here is the original post for the Greasemonkey script and the link to the thread:<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28478<br /><br />cbrdck<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Newbie<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; *<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Posts: 16<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Karma: +4/-1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View Profile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personal Message (Offline)<br /><br />Greasemonkey script to display paper currencies (USD,EUR,GBP) and cost/gram<br />« on: June 28, 2012, 12:12 PM »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br /><br />Hi guys,<br /><br />I was browsing the weed section and I thought it would be useful to see the prices in GBP as well as BTC. I started doing just that and from there it kinda got out of control a bit.<br /><br />So I give you my greasemonkey script:<br />* Gets the exchange rates from intersango.com<br />* Adds paper currency column next to BTC price column on category listings.<br />* * Switch between GBP, EUR and USD by clicking the header link (&quot;&lt;-&gt;&quot;)<br />* Adds another column with &lt;currency&gt;/gram cost. This is picked up from title and may not always work, so do not trust implicitly.<br />* The above are also displayed in item detail page<br />* Saves the exchange rates and your currency preference in a cookie<br /><br />Maybe someone else will also find this useful. If you have GreaseMonkey installed, get the script from here:<br /><br />http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/137270<br /><br />In case you missed it above, **THIS SCRIPT CREATES A COOKIE TO STORE THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE AND YOUR PREFERRED CURRENCY** <br />Phew. I was required by UK law to let you know. And I&#039;m all for the Law, guys, i am seriouslah.<br /><br />I am releasing this code under DGAFv3. Feel free not to give a fuck either.<br /><br />edit: new d/l link<br /><br />edit 2: If the install button doesn&#039;t work for you, right click the install button, click View User Script Source, and you should see a yellow bar with an install button. Alternatively, save to somewhere and load manually.<br /><br />* It goes without saying, don&#039;t visit unless over Tor. Kind of a dead giveaway.<br />
