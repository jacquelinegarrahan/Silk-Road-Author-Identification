				I was just wondering how if there are many people who buy drugs from SR and then sell them IRL.<br />Since prices are really good here I believe many people would find it profitable to do it.<br /><br />That&#039;s how I learned SR in the first case. My dealer had weed and come by one day and we took some lsd together. In the end he confessed that he was getting all the stuff through here. (glad he did, but I still buy weed from him because I don&#039;t really trust our customs here in Sweden. Btw what do you say about receiving weed in Sweden?)<br /><br />All the best<br /><br />Adamiz

				I&#039;d say yes.&nbsp; There are a lot of bulk sales on SR that most people do not have access to.&nbsp; Even with weed, an ounce costs about the same for equal quality, but people rarely give discounts on buying a QP.&nbsp; If I buy a QP of top bud off of SR for 1,100$ it would easily go for 1400$ making 300$.

				I can get the bulk deals they have on SR for Weed and acid fairly easily, but RCs like MDMA, 25i and canna concentrates I can not source for those prices locally or anywhere near the SR prices so for those items I buy off here and re sell for a handsome profit.

				Oh boy, here comes a LONG post from Festivalia!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />So, when I first got introduced the dark-web and sites like this one... I was already well up the social ladder, which one typically needed to be respected enough before anyone on any higher-level would deal with. Earned my brownie-points by making runs for various suppliers and dealers, etc. Got into growing... breeding... but then the game went crazy. I do honestly believe it was the first introduction of massive sites like this(and not just word-of-mouth, old school chat-rooms, forums, etc) but suddenly our prices(as growers) were coming up. I had NO problem with that... but, one time while I was home(holidays) several states away from my operation... it got raided. My mentor took the fall; but he actually only got charged on the IRS/money side of it. Not even for laundering... cause... we weren&#039;t. But, he had at least 60k in cash &quot;unaccounted&quot; for and the IRS chewed up him good for that.<br /><br />No DEA was involved; just Sheriffs dept. And they were pretty cool about it; left our mothers alone, and didn&#039;t scour the property to find out outdoor stuff. But they took all of our clones, dried/trimmed/cured/prepared product. And no one got charged on any of that(they probably sold it. lmao)<br /><br />After that, I was forced to get into the Social/dealing aspect of it full-on. I took what I could salvage from my outdoor, and other money I had saved, and I started buying off other growers who knew I was &#039;cool&#039; ... but as I said, the prices for LBs had come up dramatically. When I was growing, 2500 was standard. 2k for a good friend. By the time I was dealing, 4K+ had become the standard. I knew people paying 4800-5k for a lb at that time in upstate... it has since come back down, but it&#039;s around the 3600-3900 range. <br /><br />Being introduced to this site has gotten me prices much closer to what I used to sell Lbs for. And for an ex-grower, this had been brutal up until SR, really. Some of the same people I was selling lbs to for 2k, were asking 3500 from me. OR MORE. <br /><br />I have made so many &#039;friends&#039; in so many AWESOME vendors here, that I really do feel like I&#039;m back where I once was. For 5k I can get 2lbs of some &quot;on the trimmy side&quot; dank, year round, right here on SR. And for 5500, I can get 2lbs of the &#039;drop your jaw from 10 feet away&#039; stuff pretty much whenever also. <br /><br />The REAL money-maker here for me though, was MDMA and Bitcoin. I made 30k in profit off coin this past year. If I had sat on all the coins that have made their way to my suppliers... I&#039;d be a multi-millionaire, ten times over. Hindsight... but also, MDMA is dirt cheap out of NL. And if you&#039;re not a complete moron, use one-time receiving addresses, international-express, and use the &#039;right&#039; vendor... you can very quickly turn 2k into 10k in a week. This is what I started doing the moment I found SR. <br /><br />Honestly... Bitcoin + Escrow + USPS = Genius.

I know there are&nbsp; couple who do international shipping, but I don&#039;t know off-hand which ones. I did see a new guy by the name of &quot;Walmart&quot; advertizing world-wide shipping, and his prices are reasonable, even for the US. Many strains.<br /><br />MDMA, I would recommend Belgium or NL. There are a lot of vendors in Germany and Canada with MDMA... and I&#039;ve had it all. A lot of the bad, bunk, or beat MDMA comes from those places, imo.<br /><br />:) - The LSD in the US, if you have the right connections, is amazing. &quot;White on White&quot; White-Crystal, &quot;Fluff&quot; LSD. All rumors aside, the only people who really seem to have this stuff for cheap are people associated with the Grateful Dead as it has been their driving force for the last 50 years. They used to give it out at shows... now it&#039;slike 150-200 a sheet. The lot-rat re-sellers do it for 300-400 a sheet. Everywhere on SR, it seems like its 500-600+ for a sheet. :P<br /><br />
