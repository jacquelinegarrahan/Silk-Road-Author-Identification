				I&#039;m sitting on around 100BTC at the moment and I don&#039;t want to cash out yet.<br />I&#039;m happy to offer loans to established forum members who need some coin.<br />I thought 20% interest per week would be fair to protect myself against potential losses.<br /><br />Any takers?

Consider folks like Chronic Smern, and a bunch of others on here. Fucking scammers all of them, racking up posts, waiting for their chance to pull some shit.

				20 bitcoins would be nice for me, I could make the order I wanted to about 5 days in advance, and you&#039;d have it all paid back by Friday. But if it&#039;s going to be 20% payback I don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it for me.

				<br />When stuff like this works, it gives new members confidence that the community isn&#039;t full of scamming charlatans. I believe new members are less likely to try petty rip-offs if they see the community as a whole is trusting and trustworthy. <br /><br />larsson72- 13 BTC lent. 15% p/w interest.
