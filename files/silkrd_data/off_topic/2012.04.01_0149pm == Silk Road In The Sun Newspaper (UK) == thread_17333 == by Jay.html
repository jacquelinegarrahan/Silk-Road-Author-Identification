				&quot;DRUG dealers are operating beyond the reach of law in a sinister parallel online universe called the Dark Web. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;But by simply downloading special software freely available on the net, you can anonymously access a world of evil with no fear of being caught.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Former Home Secretary David Blunkett said last night: &quot;I&#039;m amazed by what The Sun has uncovered. It is utterly sinister â€” an online engine of the criminal underworld.&quot; <br /><br />How objective! <br />

				What annoys me the most (god, I hope this doesn&#039;t offend anyone) is that it&#039;s in The Sun...it has the reading age of an 8 year old (linguistically - for real!) so the people that read it are hardly, er, well, smart - especially given the crap articles the publish. I hope this won&#039;t mean in flux of idiots here!
