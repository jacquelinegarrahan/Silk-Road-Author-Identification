				Hello fellow silkroadians :)<br /><br />Weird topic, but I&#039;m curious what other people have experienced about intimacy while rolling with a friend of the opposite sex.&nbsp; I had to take a Junior level writing class at my college, and I wrote a fictional (unfortunately) story about how a person (told it in first person, so me) was best friends with a beautiful girl who he had known for years and was fairly attracted to but never made a move on.&nbsp; Luckily for him, she was just as attracted to him as well but was too scared to show it.&nbsp; One night, he got some molly and they rolled together and while giving each other massages they started to kiss and touch each other and confided in each other about how attracted they really were to each other-naturally the rest is history.<br /><br />Although I wrote a fictional story (got a B+ on it too XD), I&#039;m curious about how many people have been able to let down the social barriers that imprison each and every one of us by using MDMA with a close friend or significant other.&nbsp; I know that when MDMA was re-synthesized about 40 years ago that it was used for therapeutic uses-but if anybody has a story to share about how MDMA has either:<br />1) Improved/strengthened a friendship<br />2) Begun a relationship with someone due to the amazingness their presence has felt while on MDMA <br />3) Bonded with somebody random/shared an intimate experience with someone who you probably wouldn&#039;t have ever done so with without MDMA <br /><br />If so, how has this improved your life?&nbsp; Are you happy you got to experience this, or regret it?<br /><br />I hope for a lively discussion about this topic :)&nbsp; <br /><br />

				The thing is it&#039;s not taking advantage if she consumes the drugs knowingly and willingly. Unless you pressure her into doing it anyway. <br /><br />I don&#039;t like this idea people have that women ought to be treated like children and need to be babied. And it&#039;s mostly women who have created this bullshit situation for themselves. If you choose to consume a drug, whatever you do while under the influence of it is your own responsibility.

				When I&#039;m around guys and we are on pure mdma we just want to ... talk, and maybe cuddle and stuff, but it&#039;s always way more about bonding than it is about being sexual... plus all my guy friends say when they are rolling they aren&#039;t horny/their dicks are shriveled (even around their girlfriends..or super hot girls :P). This is as opposed to being drunk or on coke when all you want to do is get it onnn but you don&#039;t really care about intimacy. So I&#039;m going to answer this is a non-sexual way: when I&#039;m with someone that I was friends with before taking mdma, the mdma definitely brings us closer. But usually if I meet someone while on mdma and then see them again when sober, I definitely don&#039;t feel the closeness I did when high because the experience feels almost kind of fake in hindsight. So (in my opinion) I don&#039;t think mdma jump starts a friendship if you are meeting the person for the first time while high. Unless you only ever see the person when you are both rolling&nbsp; :P But I think it definitely develops relationships that were formed without the help of drugs.

				I have never &quot;jumpstarted&quot; any relationship while rolling. However, I love to roll with my girlfriend in a peaceful setting. She prefers the club scene, but I like a nice hike in the wilderness bonding and sharing with eachother. I have fucked a couple times on MDMA, but both of us usually don&#039;t have as much feeling and desire and it just keeps on going till the sun comes up with no climax on either end.

				Massaging and playing with each others hair. Both guys by the way. While sober, even that is kind of disgusting due to homophobia even if it&#039;s totally normal <br /><br />But the things you&#039;re able to talk about while on MDMA.. They&#039;d be never spoken without it and really, friendships become deeper and better thanks to MDMA

				I&#039;ll always regret that my first roll was alone. Incredible night that I&#039;ll never forget but I wish I could have shared it with someone. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t stop me from sending an obscene amount of texts to my friend about how I love him in a totally hetero way. The following week was quite awkward for me.

				On the first night I took MDMA I was on a festival. We were 4, one very good friend, one guy who I knew from party and one girl I saw the first time.<br />We were all newbies, expect for party-guy, it was his 2nd experience. In the middle of a concert, we began to roll. It was amazing. We were hugging us all the time and began to kiss each other, later we were making out. The girl was excited, she was not leaving me alone one second. I was never so full of love before. We were kissing us the whole experience and she kept telling me &quot;I love you, I love you for that&quot;.<br />Sadly the comedown was harsh, because I began to notice I felt no real love there. <br /><br />The next day our group took LSD + a new person, a good friend of the girl. Man, she was cute! She is my girlfriend now :)
