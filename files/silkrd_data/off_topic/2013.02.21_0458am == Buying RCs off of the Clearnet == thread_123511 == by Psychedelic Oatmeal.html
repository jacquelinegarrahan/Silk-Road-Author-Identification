				Anyone have any experience doing this? Looking for Psychs such as 25i, 4-AcO-DMT and such. While the road is great, you can get away with buying those on clearnet without having to go through the trouble of getting BTC. However, I can&#039;t seem to find any proper vendors, and when I do, they don&#039;t ship to the US.

				those sites are so sketchy you&#039;ll most likely get your card skimmed. is it skimming when it&#039;s online? i don&#039;t know but i wouldn&#039;t advise it. the amount of hassle with your banks fraud department, them freezing your accounts and stuff. imo it&#039;s not worth it and you know who&#039;s got the best on the road. if you must use clearnet then use a credit card rather than debit if possible as they offer more fraud protection and it&#039;s not your money they will steal

				Funny, I came to SR because I wanted 4HO-MET AND SR offers anonymity the RC sites on the clearnet cannot offer. Op Webtryp and the Farmers Market bust both had some unencrypted trialst Properly using SR their is no VISA trail to my door or unencrypted communication their for any eye. It meant I had to learn PGP and how to acquire BTC. Even funnier is that during this whole process I have gotten more interested in internet security, privacy and the merits of intense self governance. Lots of knowledge to acquire. Oh yeah, I also get user reviewed products and services, that&#039;s pretty bad ass. :) :)

				I recently bought some nbome from clearnet. Seems like you basically have to do your research on the vendors in much the same way you would here. As far as I understand, nbome family is considered an analogue of 2c family in the USA, and therefore the european vendors (at least the one I bought from) are generally unwilling to send it there. Many people on a forum I was reading were insistent that being caught with nbome would be treated exactly the same by LE as being caught with LSD. Basically, the law is murky, and the cops are treating like it&#039;s illegal.<br /><br />It&#039;s several more times expensive on the clearnet as well, and there is much less of a community gathering anecdotal data on strength, quality of service etc. On top of that, if you do find someone to send it to you, the packaging probably won&#039;t be as stealthy as an SR vendor, just through lack of experience if nothing else.<br /><br />Good luck.

				<br /><br />A number of years ago I had very good results with products from China. <br /><br />Id start small, pay up front to establish trust, then 50% upfront and 50% upon delivery for orders afterwards. <br /><br />

				i have experience with clearnet vendors... (sadly none i used ships to US and most of them got shut down since i used them) <br />lots of fake sites out there. be careful. look for one that allows customer reviews.<br />&nbsp;but if its illegal in your country you really shouldn&#039;t mess with it on clearnet.

				There are a few reliable RCs websites out there, from which many vendors on SR get their supply I guess. <br /><br />If I can buy the RCs I want on the clearnet, I go for it, since it&#039;s a lot cheaper. Prices on SR for currently legal RCs are like 10 to 50 times more expensive. <br /><br />safeorscam.com is the website that lets you know if such and such website is safe, or a scam.

				I remember back when am2201 wasn&#039;t banned yet. I bought so much of that shit knowing it would be made illegal. Cashed in on that big within the last year.
