				Preload/ Post Load - shit load of info on the net about this.<br /><br />Space out the rolls<br /><br />Take vitamins before and after, drink water/try eat something before you goto sleep<br /><br />Invest in some 5HTP to take after rolling, helps with the restoration of serotonin in the brain.<br /><br />Also helps if you have clean MDMA to start of with

				Stop using MDMA you fucking faggot. MDMA depletes your serotonin. If it&#039;s affecting you like this now, imagine the long term effects it&#039;s going to have on your biochemistry. Find other drugs instead.

Thank you for feeding the propaganda troll there.. <br /><br />&nbsp;It does not deplete your&nbsp; serotonin.. It DOES force a massive release of serotonin and then feed off that&nbsp; leaving your levels TEMPORALLY low.. In a healthy adult its back up pretty quick.. <br /><br />For a Healthy adult.. The extreme shortest amount of time between rolls would be two weeks and even that is pushing it.. You are better off with 4 to 6 weeks.. <br /><br />Pre and post load.. 5HTP and B Vits are ESSENTIAL Eating well also goes a long way.. <br /><br />&nbsp;You can eat before as someone say BUT if you do.. DO not take it orally. You will need to take it Sublingual or plug that puppy.. If you take it on a full tummy A. it takes FOREVER to come up. B. You will lose potency as it is broken down with the food.&nbsp; You will also notice that you will not have as much energy... I personally recommend that you eat a healthy breakfast, lite lunch like a salad maybe with grilled chicken on it or boiled eggs ,&nbsp; &nbsp;Take your dose with a bottle of 5 hour energy NOT and energy drink.. 5 HOUR ENERGY its full of B vits... <br /><br />I also take 5htp every day.. I take it at bedtime @200mg helps you sleep and will increase serotonin supply there for increasing you mood on a daily bases.. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you are one of those people that can eat while rolling, keep fresh or frozen fruit on hand.. <br /><br />Also.. YES quality matters here.. Stay away from Pressed pills if you are trying to avoid the hard come downs.. Nice crystal that TEST black . purple is the way to go and worth every penny!!&nbsp; If you are more worried about price then deal with the hang over.. OR.. have a look at BK-MDMA AKA Methylone it uses 1/3rd the serotonin that MDMA does.. It has a shorter roll tho but there is basically no hangover even when you abuse the hell out of it for MOST people.. I have seen a few that swear its the other way around but I mean 1 in 100 on that..&nbsp; I think the best thing I ever saw in relation to BK-MDMA was this quote &quot;Bk-MDMA is like MDMA for adults&quot; I had to LOL but it is kinda true.. it more low key.. <br /><br />
