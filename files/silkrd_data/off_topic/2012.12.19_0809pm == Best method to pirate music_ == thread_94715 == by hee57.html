				How do you all acquire your music. Currently I use youtube converters to download stuff and then just edit the metadata myself but that can get tedious. Any better methods? P2P clients tend to be better for full albums but I prefer downloading singular songs rather than albums.

				Private torrent trackers is all I bother with. Once you have access to one of the better ones out there (I use what.cd, but I think there are a few other decent ones), there&#039;s no reason to look anywhere else for pirated music.

I used to have a waffles account but, it got banned due to inactivity. I was able to find more music on what.cd than waffles. I wish i wouldn&#039;t of lost that account though. :/ But, anyways the best private music tracker i know of is what.cd and the best private general tracker i know of is iptorrents. I&#039;ve been a member on both sites for three years. I&#039;ve never received a virus from these sites, anything from my internet provider for copyright infringement or had any legal problems using these sites. When i first started off three years ago. I used many public trackers which lead to me getting a warning from my internet provider. Also, i had lawyers coming after me saying they were going to take me to court if i didn&#039;t pay so much money. I didn&#039;t pay them since i knew if they had any evidence, they obtained it illegally. Plus, if they really had as big of a case as they claimed. Why would they offer me an under the table deal? The things people do to make a dollar.<br /><br />My point is this. Torrents are the safest and fastest way to download digital media. The way torrents work, it&#039;s impossible for one person to inject a virus because each packet of data is checked with a hash key. You change the file, you change the hash checksum. If someone tries to inject a virus into a file, then your torrent client will just reject the data they try to insert into the pool. <br /><br />Also, sites that end in .com i wouldn&#039;t use. If a domain ends in .com, somehow the US government is able to shut .com&#039;s down easier than others. For instance the sites i mentioned. <br /><br />www.iptorrents.me<br /><br />www.what.cd<br /><br />Both of these don&#039;t end in .com. Also, both of these sites are invite only. (With the exception of what.cd. You can get an account by taking their quiz.) Oh, and another thing that is good about private trackers is the community. It&#039;s really neat to talk to people that enjoy the same content as you. whether it be your favorite artist, a new movie etc. Ok, I&#039;m done rambling. :D

Once you have been a member for a year you can invite people.
