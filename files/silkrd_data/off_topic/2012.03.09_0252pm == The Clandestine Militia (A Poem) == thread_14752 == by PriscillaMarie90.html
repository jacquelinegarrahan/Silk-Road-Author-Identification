				Interesting. A young person&#039;s poem. At the other end of life, try Dylan Thomas:<br /><br />Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />Old age should burn and rage at close of day;<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br />Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

				What if the [perceived] incompetence and injustice of society is due to weakness and immaturity in the masculine aspects of culture?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The major cause of anger in the father relationship is the result of growing up with a father who had difficulty in communicating his love and in affirming his children. Misdirected father anger may be a contributing conflict in our schools and homes today. Many children who have intense father-anger present with conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorders, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorders, and intermittent explosive disorders.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lashing out with anger and violence may be a natural vent but ultimately that seems to be more masculine immaturity.

				During my searches for terrestrial intelligence the psychotic ape known as &quot;Human&quot; has been most disappointing. Intelligence and consciousness seem to be fickle and fleeting in this beast; it occurs more as sparks than a sustained fire. Inspired by the poetic theme of this thread I offer the supposition: perhaps the monkey can not burn and it should strive for the day that all are looked over by machines of loving grace.

Natural imitators. We have potential to educate ourselves. The trouble with changing your mind, is if you&#039;ve built up a network of associations in your brain related to the thing you want changed, then they are reinforcing the thing you want to remove. Which is why it&#039;s usually easier to think of a slightly different idea, instead of a completely different one. This is why weight loss programs don&#039;t work in the long term, why addicts remain so etc. People would rather die than change their minds on a whole range of issues. In fact they do. That&#039;s why you have to change your entire environment to begin again. I&#039;m sure you notice people &#039;purge&#039; themselves of certain things e.g. chopping up a boyfriend&#039;s photos, flushing a pack of cigarettes etc, throwing away clothes. It&#039;s a basic instinct. The bigger the change, the further you have to go.<br /><br />Sudden sweeping changes are not in human nature, gradual evolutionary modification is. Even seemingly drastic changes are usually the result of a tortuously long process not immediately perceivable.

(A metaphor isn&#039;t a component on the motherboard). Some might find it interesting and informative to imagine that within the species and races that there might be organically evolved, multi-generational archetypal scenarios [behavior systems, lifestyles and social environments] that create Types of people, some of which are extraordinary and some are evolutionary singularities in their degree of self-design.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Beyond the naturally occurring scenarios that shape people, there is also a history of active design. Archaic peoples would act out their myths. Many peoples engage in ritual mutilation, tattooing, scaring and other traumatic initiations. Modern peoples still perform circumcision on infants without anesthesia. Mercifully, eunuchs are no longer created. In modern (Western) culture there are groups and individuals, professional and freelance, that engage in a variety of &quot;transformational&quot; practices.<br /><br />A Judo-like approach utilizing the underlying architecture that is already present may be a very effective technique.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14752.msg150691#msg150691">Quote from: morningRain on March 14, 2012, 02:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A community of (shaman-alchemist) researchers and explorers assembling a knowledge-base of human reprogramming potentials and methods might be interesting.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are free independent competent adults who wish to expand themselves and/or re-engineer themselves.
