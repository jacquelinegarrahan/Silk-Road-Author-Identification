				Long time toker here. So i&#039;ve been seriously considering starting selling weed to friends and coworkers. We dont have a good hookup, and I finally have access to supply from SR<br /><br />Anyways Ive been reading all the guides asking friend dealers (live far away) for the tips ect, so i think im covered.<br /><br />Im looking to buy QP for under 1000. Maybe mixed? to get started<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />I&#039;ve looking through all the listings for days in my attempt to make a smart decision. <br /><br />Any recommendations of product? maybe something I overlooked.

				Well I wouldn&#039;t just jump right into getting a QP, I&#039;d probably try out some vendors here for smaller amounts, most won&#039;t sell over 1oz period, others won&#039;t sell over 1oz until you have purchased from them or have high feedback.<br /><br />This will let you know which vendors you have an easier time communicating with, how safe you are with their packaging, and the quality of their product.<br /><br />Look at the vendors profiles, not just the products page, as many will list information there if they offer larger amounts, and the price breaks for these amounts.

				Grow your own. Its not that hard. Summer time is around the corner. Start germinating some seeds now and with a little bit of patience and a green thumb, you could have over a QP by fall.<br /><br />Even better if you have a thousand bucks to invest, buy some grow lights and do a closet grow! There is so much great info online for free that youd be crazy not to grow your own if you plan to sell.&nbsp;

Take a 1/4 out for myself. Sell the other 3/4 for a min of 300 probably in eighths. And smoke for &quot;free&quot;<br /><br />At least that is my startup plan. Let&#039;s see how it goes.

				Weed is a lot of work to make any decent money selling, unless your growing. I think selling enough that you smoke for free is a good stopping point. The good thing is that many tokers also do other drugs, all of which is now an order away for you, and higher profits since a lot of it is hard to impossible to find depending on your area.<br /><br />In my area, no one has shrooms as good as is on SR, 90% of all MDMA is fake, and no one has ever even heard of nbome let alone tried it - on the flip side, meth is dirt cheap here as well as adderral (compared to SR).
