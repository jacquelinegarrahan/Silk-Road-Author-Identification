				Does anyone familiar with the subject know the difficulty with selling these? Is there a big database somewhere where if you enter the serial number you can check if it has been reported stolen? If I were to buy a stolen device would I be able to use it without getting busted, assuming my house isn&#039;t raided? Are there any strategies one can partake in to sell stolen items on eBay, like maybe selling to faraway countries? A general summary on the difficulty and risks of using and selling stolen smartphones and laptops would be appreciated.

				They need to be jail-broken pronto , so tracking&nbsp; can be disabled as far I&#039;m aware . <br /><br />If tracking is not disabled and if there in a built up area - they can be pinpointed to within something like 50 ft .<br /><br />Only way to sell them on ebay would be through a stealth account , they can purchased or created - but your buyer would be sure to know it was stolen as you would need to remove certain id numbers ect - you sure couldn&#039;t do it on the regular .<br /><br />You would be best to have your own .onion store - there are a few turn key onion store suppliers on the various tor link sites .<br /><br />I don&#039;t condone it unless there being stolen from loaded people with more money then sense though .

				All good info thanks, another question I have is is there some sort of statute of limitations for things of this nature? Or will it be permanently on a list somewhere saying that it has been stolen, assuming it is reported. Is a serial number easy to find by looking at billing or somesuch, if the owner didn&#039;t record it before it was stolen? <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, the people these are coming from have far more money than sense and have the ability to have them replaced within a day if they wanted, without taking anything even resembling a hit on their finances.

				I&#039;m not offering stolen goods to anybody nor do I even have them, just asking for general information<br /><br />That isn&#039;t as a subjective statement as you think in this case, you know all that talk about the so called &quot;1%&quot;, these people are the .01%, a whole degree higher for wealth, which also applies to how vacuous their behavior is.
