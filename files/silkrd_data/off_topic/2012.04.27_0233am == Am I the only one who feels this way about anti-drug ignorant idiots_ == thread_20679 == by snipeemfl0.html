Key word there,&nbsp; don&#039;t be dumb about it... I was always open to friends about it, so we would stop each other from getting in over our heads. <br /><br />There&#039;s a difference between experimenting and constant abuse. Some people aren&#039;t ready to take that step in highschool, or ever. Just don&#039;t let it effect your in-school/work activities negatively, and I don&#039;t see the harm. <br /><br />The biggest problem with drug use in highschool/college is the problem if your caught, not the drugs themselves. Fuck society, lmao, me and my friend had a 2 hour discussion on this last time we tripped, its the society problem, not the drugs themselves, that causes damage.

				Yeah I completely agree (I&#039;m not young now by the way, I&#039;m in my late 20s now lol).<br /><br />Anyway yeah I was kicked out of school for dealing but because of the circumstances they couldn&#039;t 100% prove it. I ended up doing education at a college a year early and being top of the class and then went to uni. What makes me laugh is that half the people who railed against it when they were 15 are all now on it and the fuck ups. Swings and roundabouts huh?

				I can&#039;t even be friends with someone that judges me for smoking weed or tripping or taking MDMA. You don&#039;t have to do those things for me to like you, but if you try to stop me or tell me that I&#039;m &quot;killing my body&quot; or &quot;getting addicted,&quot; it&#039;s a goodbye for me. Seriously, I know so many people that drink every fucking weekend, and then they&#039;re like, &quot;Oh my god, you do ecstasy a few times a year?? Are you trying to kill yourself??&quot; And I just want to slap them as hard as I can. Or the perennial coffee drinkers who are like, &quot;Don&#039;t you know that pot makes you lazy?&quot; You know who&#039;s lazy? The people that spew this bullshit without taking the time to even look anything up. Seriously,&nbsp; I have a few bookmarks to sites that prove that the drugs I do are not unhealthy. It took me like five minutes of Google searching to compile this list. So if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about, I won&#039;t blame you at first for being ignorant because you&#039;re raised in an ignorant society. Even I used to be really hardcore anti-drugs back in high school. But if you still support that bullshit AFTER I show you scientific proof that it is in fact bullshit, we&#039;re done talking. I don&#039;t have time to deal with it in between the awesome things I&#039;m doing in life. And yes, by awesome things, I mean drugs. They vastly improve my life. Deal with it.

				http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/feb/19/ecstasy-harm-brain-new-study<br /><br />That study, as well as the Peter Jennings documentary &quot;Ecstasy Rising&quot; do a lot to dispel the myth that occasional ecstasy use can do any long term damage. I mean certainly if you do it on a very regular basis, you&#039;re going to have problems with your brain. A lot of research shows some lasting memory effect on people that abuse it, but even that memory problem can possibly go away after a year or so of not doing the drug. Using the drug on a rare basis is not going to harm you, or at least there is no way that is harming you anymore than a lifetime of alcohol use. The people you know that are brain dead must have completely abused the drugs they did. I mean you can go brain dead from being alcoholic too, but the average user isn&#039;t going to do that. It&#039;s about being smart and responsible about how often you do it. I limit myself so that I can live a pretty long life. And even if it somehow took two years off my life or something, I say that it was worth it for the good times I had. I don&#039;t need to live to 150, I&#039;ll be happy making it to 80 and dying comfortably.

				The thing that really messes me up is the fucking fear mongering.. <br /><br />Like I&#039;ll be trying coke for the first time, and not know much, and my mouth goes numb, so I google it to see if it&#039;s an issue, and I start reading stuff like &quot;fast beating heart, ripping the aortic valves and bursting through the capillaries..&quot; and then my heart begins to beat faster.. <br /><br />All the anti-drug stuff just gives me a panic attack. It actually makes me paranoid. <br /><br />One time me and a mate got my other mate high for the first time. He had pretended to be high before so it was somewhat hilarious to see him trip out when he actually got high. At first he was fine but then he started worrying and was saying shit like &quot;fuck i&#039;ve read about this.. this is the schizophrenia it causes&quot;.. Etc all this fucking bullshit.<br /><br />I imagine that a lot of people have been tripped the fuck out by the all the anti-drug info out there. The worst thing you need when you have a mild chest pain on coke and you google it, is to be told by 10 people on yahoo answers that there are tears in your heart and you&#039;re going to die. <br /><br />It does more harm that in it does good.

I completely agree that all the bullshit that the government spreads does way more harm than good. For example, take MDMA. What the media conveniently leaves out of the stories of people dying on it, is that a lot of those people die from drinking too much water. And when you read the real reports, you find that a lot of them were starting to roll and they panicked because they had read some health class warning bullshit about how MDMA causes you to get dehydrated. So they panic and start drinking a ton of water thinking that if they don&#039;t, they&#039;re going to die. And they keep drinking until their kidneys stop working and their brain swells and they die. If the government spread correct information, then they would know that you&#039;re fine as long as you drink maybe one or two bottles of water throughout the night. Scaring people doesn&#039;t stop them from doing it, it just makes them do it in the wrong way, and this is extremely dangerous.

It actually makes me paranoid. <br /><br />One time me and a mate got my other mate high for the first time. He had pretended to be high before so it was somewhat hilarious to see him trip out when he actually got high. At first he was fine but then he started worrying and was saying shit like &quot;fuck i&#039;ve read about this.. this is the schizophrenia it causes&quot;.. Etc all this fucking bullshit.<br /><br />I imagine that a lot of people have been tripped the fuck out by the all the anti-drug info out there. The worst thing you need when you have a mild chest pain on coke and you google it, is to be told by 10 people on yahoo answers that there are tears in your heart and you&#039;re going to die. <br /><br />It does more harm that in it does good.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1 karma for you. I completely agree that all the bullshit that the government spreads does way more harm than good. For example, take MDMA. What the media conveniently leaves out of the stories of people dying on it, is that a lot of those people die from drinking too much water. And when you read the real reports, you find that a lot of them were starting to roll and they panicked because they had read some health class warning bullshit about how MDMA causes you to get dehydrated. So they panic and start drinking a ton of water thinking that if they don&#039;t, they&#039;re going to die. And they keep drinking until their kidneys stop working and their brain swells and they die. If the government spread correct information, then they would know that you&#039;re fine as long as you drink maybe one or two bottles of water throughout the night. Scaring people doesn&#039;t stop them from doing it, it just makes them do it in the wrong way, and this is extremely dangerous.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Shit dude for real? I didn&#039;t know that. <br /><br />I&#039;m one of those people that drinks water constantly on mdma. Not because I&#039;m paranoid, but because I&#039;m genuinely that thirsty when I&#039;m on it.

				You&#039;ll have no problem drinking water consistently throughout the night. The people that die are drinking like a gallon at a time because of the paranoia. If you just drink a normal amount due to thirst, you&#039;ll be fine. That&#039;s the kind of information the government should be putting out there. Kind of like they have those &quot;drink responsibly&quot; commercials. People need to know that it is important to drink water while rolling, but they also shouldn&#039;t have the insane notion that if they don&#039;t drink enough, they&#039;re going to die of dehydration.

It would cause me physical fucking pain.

				In my head I use the word normal to distinguish people who I can comfortably interact with in full honesty, the abnormal, from people who due to social stigma are presences which I must accommodate, the normal. And drug use is just one of the attributes which normal and abnormal separate on based on my distinction. <br /><br />But you&#039;re right, drug use is normal and we shouldn&#039;t contribute to the stigma against it.

I would say I&#039;m not even a &quot;drug advocate&quot;, it&#039;s all personal choice. You shouldn&#039;t have to take anything you don&#039;t want to and if it doesn&#039;t appeal then fair enough and buttered crumpets. It just annoys the fuck out of me when people wont be rational about their decisions and just listen to the facts. <br /><br />For example, I would class myself as quite middle-to-heavy drug user. I get on it probably 1-2 days a week but tend to for for both days straight. Sometimes I go for 3 days straight. The drugs I take are mainly Bing, MDMA, MDA, Meph and K. Now I know about these drugs and the risks they carry, I weighed those risk and decided to try them and continue to take them but not every day. This was a rational decision that I made based on the science and the knowledge of my own limits. I however would not try drugs like Heroin, Crack (although I do base coke) or Ice, this is based on how addictive they are and I feel that is too much of a risk for my own safety and I think there is a high probability I&#039;d get addicted pretty fast. Again a decision I took made on rational thought process. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t a bash on those that do take things like Ice, Heroin or Crack by the way. I&#039;m just making the point that decisions about doing anything in your life, whether to do drugs/what drugs, who you marry, what career you decide on even shit like whether you decide to get out of bed on a Monday morning or sleep all day should be made on considered and rational decisions and not gut reactions.

				There is one simple reason. It&#039;s illegal.<br /><br />Most folks don&#039;t want to willingly engage in something that breaks the law. My mom is one of those people. She thinks the police would seize her house because when I still lived at home I kept a bag of weed and a pipe in my sock drawer. <br /><br />The legal status, and the shady nature of the business of obtaining contraband is what leads to the stigma, not the substance its self.
