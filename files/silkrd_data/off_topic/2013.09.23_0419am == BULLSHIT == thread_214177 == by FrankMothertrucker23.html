				Just carry an automatic weapon so if the police get too close after tapping your cell phone you can just waste em.&nbsp; This guy I know says he does this and it seems to work out really well.

				Yeah this happens. Dude first thing. DESTROY the freaking phone. Start fresh phone + sim. Lay low for a bit.<br /><br />Make sure you clean car, house so if they decide to search you can sit there with a grin knowing they won&#039;t find anything.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to be a &quot;kingpin&quot; Sure sign is if someone you know got busted recently, they might be pulling in associates. A dog looking for less time in the kennel.

				I don&#039;t know about how this is handled in other countries, but in my country they are very thoroughly in tapping phones. You don&#039;t have to be a kingpin here at all to be affected. If they have a suspicion, they will tap the phone. If you call the tapped phone and there is anything tiny out of the ordinary, they will tap your phone as well. Police doesn&#039;t care about privacy here.<br /><br />I know half a dozen of ppl that got busted via phone tap in my city alone. None of them were big. And the city isn&#039;t huge either.<br /><br />Always use throw away phones for illicit calls. They barely cost anything. Change phones regularly. Dump phone AND simcard.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know how this is handled in other countries, but here it is no phantasm of paranoid minds, its REALITY.

				In all seriousness, LE has a super-program to catch drug dealers/smugglers where even if you throw away your phone/sim, if you contact the same group of people in the same general area, it matches you as potentially the same person.&nbsp; So be weary of this.
