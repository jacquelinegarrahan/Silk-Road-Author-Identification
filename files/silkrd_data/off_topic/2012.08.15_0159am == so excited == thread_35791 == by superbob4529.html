				Hello all, I just have to say that I am excited. I have an order in transit and 2 more processing, and I just want to express how excited I am to be a part of this place.<br /><br />I remember back in 1999 when I took my first tab, and I laid out on the ground in an outdoor party. Later I met some people who became some of my best party friends. I took a lot of psychedelics. At home, out of the house, with friends, by my self. I started guiding many of my friends through their first trip. I loved that life, but sure enough &#039;real life&#039; took over. income, salary, taxes, credit cards, BILLS. ugh. <br /><br />My main stay from that time is mj. I smoke all the time, vaporizing lately. Moving around the country has made it very difficult to find the quality and quantity of stuff that my heart really desires. I heard about SR a while ago and wanted to give the market place some time to mature. I came back recently and was so happy it was still thriving. <br /><br />Then I took some time to understand bitcoin. Holy. Shit. A universal, borderless, digital currency that has no affiliation to a sovereign nation. Put together by Satoshi Nakamoto, and nobody even knows who he is.<br /><br />This whole thing reminds me of a sci-fi story I would write. It is close to my heart. I am happy to be here and just wanted to spread good vibes out to everyone! Love you all.

				Right on man :D Welcome to the road!<br />A few tips, never FE, never let an order auto finalize, never beg for BTC (you could under certain circumstances, but better just not to)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;always remember to leave feedback, &amp; update it if necessary, always follow buyers etiquette, there&#039;s probably more but I&#039;m too high to remember.&nbsp;

				Yea I&#039;m here because I moved across the country and lost all my connects. I heard about this place a while ago but didn&#039;t ever think I would use it until a month ago. I&#039;m still pretty new to this site also and I&#039;m excited to be here too.<br /><br />I received a package yesterday and have one more in transit right now. I&#039;m high as fuck and loving it. Welcome to the SR!<br /><br />Some advice to heed, never buy bitcoins through members of the forum or vendors. Read the scam threads for more on that.

(I did moneypak) <br />Of course now I don&#039;t need to buy BTC but when I was still new, that was the only option to buy that I felt comfortable with.
