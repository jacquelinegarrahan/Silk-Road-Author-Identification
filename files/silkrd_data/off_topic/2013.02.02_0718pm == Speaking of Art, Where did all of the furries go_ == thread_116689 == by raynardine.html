				The furry fandom is a huge art community, and most of them are on the Internet or video games all day every day.<br /><br />A large contingent of them have colonized Second Life, which I see as pretty similar in spirit to Onionland.<br /><br />Why are there no furries here?

				In case you were wondering what a furry is, or are even unclear about it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You know you&#039;re a &#039;Furry Fan&#039; when...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Rabies replaces cancer as your number one disease concern.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your favorite character from Star Trek is Lieutenant M&#039;Ress (from the animated series).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You think &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was spoiled by Beast becoming human.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You replace Elle McPherson pinups with those of Amy the Squirrel, Erma Felna, or Minerva Mink.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You slip the word &#039;fur&#039; into as many places as possible in your mail.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can identify a captionless book illustration as being Doug Wingers&#039; in under ten seconds.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; None of your favorite female (or male) fiction characters are actually human.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You go to see &#039;Pocahontas&#039; for the animals.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;ve seen &quot;Balto&quot; so often you can recite the dialogue off by heart.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you think Jenna is sexy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Furry image files consist of over half of your PC&#039;s hard-drive capacity.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You know what &#039;yiff&#039; means.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The section you most frequent in the video store is the children&#039;s section.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can identify which issue of &#039;Albedo&#039; the first use of &#039;sociopolitical ramifications&#039; was used.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You find any excuse to use &quot;sociopolitical ramifications&quot; in a sentence. (And other neat jargon like &quot;psych bugs&quot;.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You try to make a journey to a mystical place called &#039;ConFurence&#039; each year.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You infiltrate your local SF convention committee, and persuade them to start a furry track/panel/room.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You know what FurryMUCK is.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you know the IP and port number by heart.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have more than one character on FurryMUCK.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You really do buy &#039;Playboy&#039; or &#039;Penthouse&#039; for the articles.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You buy wildlife magazines and &#039;National Geographic&#039; to get character ideas for your drawings.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You socialize with the pets rather than your relatives at a family gathering.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; More than half your clothing has an animal motif.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;re disappointed when the &quot;foxy babe&quot; your friend talks about turns out to be a good looking human.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and when you finally get introduced to her, you think how much better she would look with vulpine ears, thick red fur, and a bushy tail.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Insults such as &quot;you weasel&quot; or &quot;son of a bitch&quot; bring about wishful thinking.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You regularly visit the University at night, but only to hand-feed the possums (or MUCK, snarf off Avatar, run naked..)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Watching one particular furry film has given you a life-long love of a particular animal species/breed.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;re intensely jealous of Pascall Fox, Mike Rabbitt, Simon Ferret, Possum Borne...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your best friends no longer remember your real name.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You know what &quot;digitigrade&quot; means.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you can spell it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... but not &quot;ankle&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Magazines and videos with &quot;Vixens&quot; in the title that don&#039;t contain actual foxes are regarded by you as dealing in false advertising.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You wish when a human pops up in a furry cartoon that he&#039;d go away.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You become indignant at TV Medical reporters who describe harelips as disfiguring.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You name a useful program, computer, network or ISP after favourite animals.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Two-thirds of your browser bookmark file points to furry artist and story sites.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your computer backdrop/wallpaper is always a furry picture.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and so is your screensaver.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and your workmates/family no longer comment on it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Someone says &quot;Oooh, what a piece of tail!&quot;, and you spend several confused seconds looking for it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You spend more time on FurryMUCK than off it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You dream of romantic interludes with comic or cartoon furries.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and after a while it gets even more... errr... intimate ;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You dream that famous furry artists come to live in your neighbourhood.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You take your furry portfolio to job interviews that have NOTHING to do with cartooning, animation, or comics...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your favorite Robin Hood film was made by Disney and did not star Kevin Costner.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The absolute worst thing you can say about any animated production is &quot;too many damn humans.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You send in drawings of furries to your art tutor for your &#039;life studies&#039; class.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You read &#039;Genus&#039; in public places.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and see nothing wrong with it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The &#039;FoxPro&#039; icon in Windows is used for ALL your Windows computer programs.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You intently watch the exchange rate to figure out how many more cool foreign prints, &#039;zines etc you can buy for your lousy Australian/New Zealand/ Canadian/&lt;insert country of origin&gt; currency.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You remember what Avatar actually was.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You immediately begin to experience withdrawal syndromes when you favorite furry art archive goes down for moving, restructuring, security holes, etc.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You change your Internet provider so you can better access FurryMUCK.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You don&#039;t mind what you get reincarnated as, &quot;as long as I can be drawn by Terrie Smith&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You wonder, when people in horror films are transformed into werewolves or animals, why they always think of it as a bad thing...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You consider volunteering for genetic engineering experiments just so you can become your favorite furry species.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your pets are named after characters in Albedo, Xanadu or other furry comics.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You want to name your cat &quot;Omaha&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You catch yourself saying &quot;@wheeeee.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You change your name to Wolf, Fox, or Otter.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You watch the X-Files just because Mulder&#039;s first name is Fox.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You can remember when alt.fan.furry contained more discussions than flames.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You &#039;yiff&#039; in a movie theatre (or other public place).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You ALWAYS use the werewolf character while playing either Killer Instinct or Darkstalkers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You seriously consider what would happen if a furry-portrait of yourself had gone into your high-school yearbook.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You mentally choose appropriate species for your workmates.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You keep looking for the bigger, better morphing computer program, just so you can morph your face with that of a critter.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You occasionally try to walk digitigrade, just to see what it&#039;s like.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You keep wondering why Darth Vader in &quot;Star Wars&quot; sounds so much like Mufasa from &quot;The Lion King&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have more plushies than the local toyshops.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You post to alt.fan.furry on a regular basis.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... in third person, as your character on FurryMUCK.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You start to think of racial issues as analogies of furry problems, rather than the other way around.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You try to imagine &quot;Prince of Thieves&quot; or any other movie with foxes and the like.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Artistic &#039;life studies&#039; classes always mean a trip to the local zoo or wildlife park instead of drawing a nude human model.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You drink beers for their names and the animal pictures on their labels.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You watch reruns of M*A*S*H, and think that Hawkeye always calling Frank Burns &quot;ferret face&quot; was meant as a term of endearment, rather than an insult.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You think the Bennigan&#039;s restaurant slogan &quot;Food and fun for humans&quot; might be grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You actually look forward to foxes or raccoons raiding your garbage.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Kathy Ireland poster in your dorm room is taken down and replaced by a REALLY BIG furry wearing a swimsuit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You lobby actively to change your school&#039;s nickname to an animal name.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and if that doesn&#039;t work, you change schools instead.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You pick up a copy of Fur-Fish-Game, expecting to see a catalog of furry MU*s, but are cruelly surprised.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Acting on sacred and divine rules of morality and righteous indignation, you replace all the copies of Field and Stream on the rack in the waiting room with InFurNation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have at least one video copy of Animalympics, The Lion King, Meet the Feebles, Fritz The Cat, Balto and/or The Secret of Nimh.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and foreign language dubs of at least one of the above.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and at least one furry tape that is a different video standard to the one used in your country.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you buy a multi-standard VCR just to play it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have unclean thoughts about Fifi LaFlume.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You think &quot;Gadget Goes Hawaiian&quot; ranks right up there with &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You rate sports teams (Rugby League, etc) by their animal mascot rather than their playing ability.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You eat breakfast cereals just for the animals on the box.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You discontinue treatment for baldness, and start thinking you have mange instead.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You carry animal plush toys with you on business trips, and show them to the flight attendants and hotel receptionists.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and they start asking after them whenever they see you in the lobby.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You boycott the magazine &quot;Loaded&quot; on general principles after that article on Confurence.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have animal plush toys at your workstation in your office - and refer to them by name.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Your interest in Egyptian mythology stems from a fascination with animal-headed gods like Anibus and Sekhmet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You read the Journal of Medicine in hopes they&#039;ll approve fur grafts.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... or prosthetic tails.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You spend more money on buying animal soft toys on trips than buying duty-free.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you buy passports for each of them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and you try to get the passports for your animal soft toys stamped by Immigration on overseas trips.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You think the use of the term &quot;coyote ugly&quot; is derogatory - for coyotes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You get sensory feedback from body parts that you don&#039;t have.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You refer to the humans from a third person/species point of view.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You made your own &#039;You might be a Furry if...&#039; list.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You are digitigrade more than half of the time.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and don&#039;t realize it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You turn around whenever you close a door so that you don&#039;t get your tail caught.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You are upset that video game systems offer so few animal characters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You grow your own winter coat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You have been banned from the vets until you get a pet.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The police keep your bite marks as well as fingerprints on file.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You call your bed a nest.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ... and it looks like one.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You call little ones cubs, pups, hatchlings, etc...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You worry that if you bite someone you will have to be put down.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;ve ever barked at a passing car.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;ve tried to make an appointment with a &quot;Dr. Moreau&quot;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;ve grown and sharpened your nails into claws. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Sometimes I want to throttle the furs, and sometimes I want to hug every last one.<br /><br />Second Life has a lot of great communities in it. I don&#039;t want to go into too much detail, but the reason I don&#039;t use SL has nothing to do with the communities, and everything to do with grid management.
