				WARNING story is kind of gross WARNING OVER<br /><br />so one of my best friends has been staying with me the past week and he brought up a boatload of good tar with him.&nbsp; we&#039;ve been mixing it with BHO to great effect, and smoking quite a bit of it.&nbsp; he is also hispanic, and an AMAZING cook.&nbsp; we ate a lot of menudo, tamales, fajitas, he even made homemade flautas.&nbsp; it was all incredible.<br /><br />anyways, i&#039;d been smoking enough tar to not have had a bowel movement for several days, although i hadn&#039;t really noticed it cuz we were super smacked out and headbanging to juicy j for the majority of the time, taking godzilla dabs to the dome..<br /><br />anyways, eventually, he left, we smoked about 2 grams of BHO in one sitting and did god knows how much H while we were saying goodbye, and i was wasted for the rest of the night.&nbsp; i woke up the next day feeling not so great, but not so bad, either.&nbsp; then later that night, i finally released all off the amazing, heavy, fatty mexican food that had been collecting in my body all at once, and instantly felt EXTREME PAIN.&nbsp; i could not finish taking a shit, i could not get up off the toilet, my eyes were tearing up because i was hurting so bad.&nbsp; after about five minutes i finished, painfully of course, and stood up.&nbsp; i put my hand where the pain was worst, right above my groin, and fuck me, there is a very noticeable bulge now where there once was not.&nbsp; i have had a hernia before, and the pain was instantly recognizable.&nbsp; utter fucking horror<br /><br />so basically, guys and gals, please be careful when binging on both greasy food and heroin.&nbsp; i have been trying to avoid going to the doctor, but seeing as how i&#039;m starting to have trouble walking now, i think it&#039;s inevitable.&nbsp; please learn from my mistake.&nbsp; the human body is not meant to withstand that sort of abuse, or at least mine definitely wasn&#039;t.&nbsp; i&#039;m going to probably have to get a surgery soon, which means i&#039;ll need to start laying off the opiates big time in a couple weeks if i want to feel any kind of pain relief from the meds they&#039;ll prescribe me.&nbsp; &nbsp;i hate the world right now and feel i must be receiving some kind of massive karmic backlash for being a douchebag for so long or something, idk, i can&#039;t figure it out, but it&#039;s not a good time.&nbsp; i can&#039;t even have sex right now!!!!&nbsp; not that i could even if i didnt have a hernia because there&#039;s nobody around right now that wants to have sex with me, but still, it&#039;s all gone pete tong and i&#039;m in misery<br /><br />just wanted to share.&nbsp; off topic over

				i almost got a hernia from laughing to much. Real sorry man to hear your story but you can self medicate and if what the doctors give you don&#039;t cut the mustard then you can always use the road.
