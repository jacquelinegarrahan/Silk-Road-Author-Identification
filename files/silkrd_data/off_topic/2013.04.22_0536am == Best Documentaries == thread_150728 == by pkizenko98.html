				Hey<br /><br />I don&#039;t watch much TV or movies anymore, but I would like some recommendations.&nbsp; I am looking for the best educational documentary type movies to view.&nbsp; Anything on history or drugs are my preference.&nbsp; Don&#039;t recommend DMT: The spirit molecule, as I just saw it.&nbsp; Thanks

				I once had a small-dose shroom tea that made me very sleepy. After 2 hours or so of minor tripping, I decided to hit the hay, and settled down in bed to watch a few youtubes to lull me to shroomy dreams. What happened next was instead one of my most stimulating shroom experiences ever:<br /><br />Fractals- The Colors of Infinity<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk6QU94xAb8<br /><br />Narrated by Arthur C. Clarke, god damnit! It&#039;s fantastic. It&#039;s not about drugs, can be construed as historical, but is very psychedelic-friendly. Fractals are beautiful, permeate all of nature, and are simultaneously so complex and so simple. Benoit Mandelbrot is a fascinating man, and Dr. Michael Barnsley explain fractals so clearly and passionately. Apparently the music is by David Gilmour, too.

				Man on Wire or Degenerate Art are very cool documentaries. Man on Wire is a story about a man who tight roped across the twin towers. Degenerate Art is about glass pipe blowers and how it all came to be, and how it evolved into the amazingly artistic glass blowing we see today.

				My favorite docos are Baraka, Samsara, Koyanisqatsi, Powaqatsi, Naqoyqatsi &amp; Chronos by Fricke/Magidson<br /><br />and most of David Attenboroughs work is very detailed, he sets the world wide standard: &#039;First Life&#039; series, &#039;Planet Earth&#039; series, &#039;Natures Great Events&#039; series and the &#039;Life&#039; series.<br /><br />Richard Hammonds &#039;Invisible World&#039; is also very good.<br /><br />Bluray is highly recommended for all.

				Two grams, steeped once, not eaten after. I watched about 2 hours after ingestion, snuggled up in bed. I think there was something particular to the shrooms too, because I have never had a batch make me feel so sleepy. I imagine that&#039;s not so important thought, the main idea is to hit a dose where you can follow a documentary without being distracted by your own head too much (though there is enough time for that during the beautiful fractal zoom-ins; if only it was in HD). <br /><br />edit: I&#039;m feeling the pressure now, I hope you like it as much as I did.

				Just watched Searching for Sugar Man, it was fucking awesome, one of best documentaries I have seen in a long time. It was the won the Oscar for best documentary as well. About this singer in the US who a lot of talented producers thought was amazing, but he never sold any albums. Though, a person from the US brought the album to South Africa, and this singer spread quickly, and after time pretty much all of South Africa knew about this singer, he is like the equivalent to Elvis Presley, so some of the South African&#039;s decide to hunt this guy down, and then the documentary ensues.&nbsp; 8)

				What was interesting about watching the fractal doc. was that it was familiar.&nbsp; I could not tell you when or where I heard it before but I know I had some vague recollection of it.&nbsp; I have been watching that doc. in fragments since this past weekend.&nbsp; I still have not finished watching it in its entirety.&nbsp; My point is, it wasn&#039;t new to me and the doc. proved that point by the way it kept referring to eternity and infinity.&nbsp; The combination of that message of eternity and infinity mixed with the rest of my weekend led me to a mental level that I have never been on.&nbsp; It was not the drugs, those wore off and I still remain on this level.&nbsp; So newstem, thank you to infinity for leading me to that doc!

				I&#039;m somewhat of a documentary buff. In particular I like to watch documentaries by Louis Theroux, I think he&#039;s great at doing them.&nbsp; He&#039;s covered all kinds of topics, some of them are about drugs and crime but really they run the gamut from A to Z.<br /><br />You can find a lot of them on this youtube channel below.&nbsp; Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />CLEARNET <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/user/Iouistheroux<br /><br />As already mentioned by others on page 2, VICE magazine also do some very interesting documentaries from time to time, but there&#039;s a lot of stupid shit on their channel too so you kinda have to sift through the good and bad.&nbsp; Some of their docs are amazing though, so it&#039;s worth the effort of going through the list to find the ones that interest you.

				All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace. It&#039;s a&nbsp; 3 part documentary by the BBC. I found it very interesting. (clearnet link) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_Grace_(TV_series)<br /><br />It&#039;s about our relationship with computers and how dominant they became in shaping the world. First part is about the world economy and how faith in computers influenced recent financial collapses, second is about the environment and ecology, and third about human biology and racism.

				Agree with fire, anything by Adam Curtis -- he&#039;s no joke.<br /><br />Recommend starting with:<br /><br />The Century of Self - 2002 (CLEARNET: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self) <br />Illustrates how Freud&#039;s theories on unconsciousness led to Edward Bernays&#039; development of public relations, the use of desire over need and self-actualisation as a means of achieving economic growth and the political control of population.<br /><br />You will see the world different after watching.<br /><br />Also great by Curtis: <br />* The Mayfair Set -- about the early days of buccaneer capitalists.<br /><br />* The Power of Nightmares -- about the extant parallels between Islamism in the Arab world and Neoconservatism in the US, and how both need to inflate a myth of a dangerous enemy.<br /><br />* yeah All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace as fire mentioned.<br />

				A lot of good things mentioned so far. I didn&#039;t read all the posts, though so forgive me if any of these are redundant.<br /><br />Metal: A Headbangers Journey is a kickass documentary made by an anthropologist who happens to be a headbanger. Well made and interesting approach to looking at metal.<br /><br />Exit Through the Gift Shop is a really cool, multi-layer doc that&#039;s about Banksy, sort of. It&#039;s funny and intriguing to see how the story unfolds and takes on its own life.<br /><br />Through the Wormhole is an excellent science type show that explores hella-fied deep questions about the universe. Plus it&#039;s narrated by Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />I Like Killing Flies. Sort of a food documentary but very much an interesting character study. Funny.<br /><br />Grizzly Man and Into the Abyss by Dir. Werner Herzog probably wouldn&#039;t enhance any drug experience but they are moving and challenging and nobody else that I&#039;ve ever found really makes documentaries like him.
