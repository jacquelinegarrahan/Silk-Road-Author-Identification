				is this your first time taking it?&nbsp; <br /><br />If so, it&#039;s a pretty hefty dose to start out with and I&#039;m assuming you inhaled it and not oral?&nbsp; 150.&nbsp; You&#039;re gonna see some shit but just go with it no matter how fucked up/disturbing it gets.&nbsp; Just tell yourself that you took a large dose of MXE and you&#039;re gonna be ok at the end of it.&nbsp; You&#039;re not gonna die, you really DO exist and you&#039;re not god.&nbsp; Just relax and enjoy the ride.&nbsp;

				Hope you&#039;re okay. If you took 150mg as your first dose then I&#039;m guessing you didn&#039;t do your research. Either that or you think you&#039;re some kind of super human or something?<br /><br />It&#039;s been estimated that MXE is 4 times stronger than k. Based on that, you took the equivalent of 600mg of ketamine. A huge fucking dose (especially if you don&#039;t have any tolerance).<br /><br />Am guessing you passed out and went into crazy land. Am hoping you called somebody up to help you as being in that crazy state shit can go wrong quite easily (I&#039;m talking injuring yourself physically).<br /><br />So yeah, hope you report back later. I guess this is just a reminder to always do your research.

				First Moonbear, now this guy.&nbsp; These are the exact posts we *dont* need around here.&nbsp; We all talk about what would happen to SR if some person who didnt do enough damn research bought drugs off here and then overdosed.&nbsp; Can you not at least just like ask in drug safety before you take your drugs?&nbsp;

				I snorted 130mg before and thought I was going to die. I kept blacking out while trying to find my way to a phone to call for help. I checked my heart rate on an excessive and it was in the 200s. There was an intense buzzing on my brain and I was scared to death. I&#039;ll never go over 90mg again.

For the OP you&#039;ll be fine, I used to rail 200mg lines when I began binging and I&#039;ve seen people snort 250mg before they did collapse at one point but were fine afterwards. That said don&#039;t be a fucking idiot. 80bpm is fine, at rest (no exercise) your bpm should be 60-100bpm the worst you&#039;re going to have is a panic attack from being a retard.

				Not sure about a lethal dose but if you&#039;re still couscous then you haven&#039;t hit it. You will black out and not be typing that&#039;s for sure if you get to the lethal end. So relax and try to enjoy and do more research next time RC&#039;s don&#039;t have alot of room for error so be more careful next time.

				Hey guys i am fine and yes i did plenty of damn research on mxe before taking this kind of dose. was just looking for opinions.&nbsp; I started taking 25-50mg experimenting every other day or two just taking very small doses then working up to 50mg. I was kind of panicking a bit yesterday but not were i would hurt my self or anything.wtf some people are absurd, i just logged out cause i had a mhole to attend. Some people need tp chill the out with the comments if you dont know whats going on. Instead of getting pleasure out of your damn comments.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am very experienced in psychedelics and usually stick with that in high doses and enjoy it very much. The trip just put me in the M-hole i guess. In and out. It was a weird experience not really the enjoyable experience everyone hypes it up to be. Mxe imo is not really worth tripping on if you like psychedelics like lsd mushrooms and K. imo. Meaning others may think different. Anyways i tried it like 10 times already and all i got to say is FUCK MXE it is no fun dont see were it helps depression most of the time in small doses. just made me edgy and sometimes even cranky. Forget this ....&nbsp;

				having done&nbsp; plenty of research doesn&#039;t really correlate asking if you&#039;re going to die. Maybe MXE just isn&#039;t for you, not everyone likes disassociates just the same how not everyone likes meth or coke.
