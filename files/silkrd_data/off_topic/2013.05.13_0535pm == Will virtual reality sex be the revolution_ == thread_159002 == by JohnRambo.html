				We all know how porn has revolutionized relations between men and women. After all, it&#039;s very hard to be satisfied with an ordinary woman when you can watch porn and imagine having sex with a perfect 10.<br /><br />http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/12/17/company-developing-fully-immersive-virtual-reality-sex-game/<br /><br />Looks like VR, virtual reality sex, is almost here. It will probably be available within a couple of years and becomes mainstream within 10 years.<br /><br />What will feminists and women in general do when most men would rather fuck a supermodel in virtual reality than have sex in real life with a fat, bitchy, smelly cunt?<br /><br />Looks like women and feminists are going to lose out to technology!<br /><br /><br />Sinful Robot, the company which is developing the first virtual reality sex program, is currently hiring.<br /><br />http://www.sinfulrobot.com/careers.html<br /><br />They are looking for the following positions:<br />3D Environment Artist<br />Senior 3D Environment Artist<br />3D Character Artist<br />Senior 3D Character Artist<br />Character Animator<br />Senior Character Animator<br />3D Programmer<br />Senior 3D Programmer<br /><br />Here&#039;s your chance, guys, to do something which will make a difference in the world. The sooner VR sex can be created and released to the public, the sooner men can be freed from the tyranny of real life human women.

				John Titor here. I am a famous time traveler, in case you don&#039;t know who I am.<br /><br />I just got back from the year 2034, and I&#039;d like to share with you all what I saw there.<br /><br />Female robots just got released and are being sold now in all major electronic stores. I saw lines of hundreds of men lining up to buy them.<br /><br />As the men were walking into the electronic stores, there were vast numbers of furious and angry women shouting and screaming at the men. The women were screaming &quot;YOU SEXIST PIGS!!! YOU CAN&#039;T HANDLE A REAL WOMAN!!!!! YOU ARE SUCH A LOSER THAT YOU ARE BUYING A FEMALE ROBOT!!!!&quot;<br /><br />This type of angry feminist protest is taking place at virtually every location where Female Robots are being sold. But, they are not having an effect. Female Robots are the biggest technological success EVER. 5 MILLION Female Robots were sold in the first two days alone.<br /><br />So that&#039;s it. In the year 2034, real women will begin to be replaced by Female Robots, and real human women will become obsolete by the year 2038.<br /><br />John Titor here, reporting out.

				My question to all the women here.<br /><br />Why should I waste my time with some bitchy western woman when I can go to Asia and get a super hot beautiful and submissive Asian girl? Who won&#039;t nag me, bitch at me, and will treat me with respect?<br /><br />You retarded western women don&#039;t seem to realize that you have overpriced yourself out of the market. It&#039;s like someone trying to sell a used Ford for 100,000 dollars. Sorry ladies, but men have woken up to your bullshit and ain&#039;t buying the shit sandwich you are selling anymore.<br /><br />So until sex robots are created, I&#039;ll just spend my time in Asia, having relationships with beautiful and awesome Asian women.<br /><br />You western women truly are garbage.

For men to enjoy VR sex it is mostly only a graphics problem.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />That may have a much more general meaning. Separate but related modes of selection. It adequately explains why sex and sexes exist at all.<br /><br />Consider: women select for status, men for appearance. The females decorate themselves for hours and the male obtain useless but expensive objects. Clearly these funny creatures are up to something, because on the face of it a lot of this is maladaptive behavior.<br /><br />So what is status, but some average of overall intellect, and what is appearance, but some average phenotype of environmental fitness. Status and phenotype are like powerful heuristics to determining what is inside, indirectly reading the genes themselves.<br /><br />Then, by creating hybrids and continually reiterating with natural selection, you get this ideal trade off between the evolutionary pressures for higher intelligence and higher environmental fitness. See, every biologist knows brain size is an incredibly expensive but extremely useful commodity in the natural world, and every biologist knows that a useful adaption can often become the subject of an arms race, quickly resulting in extinction because too much evolution in one direction causes an overspend which in a twist of irony prevents adaption when the environment changes. It&#039;s like the division of labor when people specialize a lot and then the economy tanks and they&#039;re all out of work.<br /><br />So: males and females have sex because it prevents all kinds of dangerous arms races, evolution working too rapidly. Well, they think that they want to fuck because the girl is pretty or the boy is a good provider, but it is the same thing.

				I am against porn because it degrades women. And so does prostitution. <br /><br />John Rambo. I think Islam is really a thing for you. Because in Islamic law a woman has to obey her husband and has to ask his permission to leave to house. And if she wants to divorce from her husband she has to give back every thing the husband gave her. And in the Quran it is said that the male is a step above the female. Plus you are free to marry up to four.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey, at least you are safe from women making a false rape accusation against you if you use porn, virtual reality sex, or a Female Robot.<br /><br />You women have made sex and relations with you so dangerous and risky for men, that many, if not most men, are starting to literally give up on you. Why should men marry you, just so that later on you can divorce him and financially rape him in divorce court?<br /><br />You women whine that men don&#039;t want to get married anymore. Maybe if you&#039;d stop whining and start demanding that the family law system should become FAIR to men, and stop being so biased and unfair towards men, men might, and I mean MIGHT, turn around and start marrying you women again?<br /><br />You women are so unintelligent that you can&#039;t even see the immediate consequences of your extremely selfish actions and behaviors. This must be why all ancient societies never gave freedom to women, because they KNEW that if women are given freedom, women destroy civilization.

				Or here is another example of the utter hypocrisy and total lack of morality of western women.<br /><br />For example, most western women criticize Thailand and it&#039;s open practice of prostitution.<br /><br />In other words, western women think there is something wrong with paying money to another woman for sex.<br /><br />And yet, how many TENS OF MILLIONS of men have gotten financially destroyed in divorce to western women, where the woman takes all the guy&#039;s money, house, car, kids, etc?<br /><br />Is marriage not legal prostitution? <br /><br />That is why western women hate Asia and Thailand, because it gives men OPTIONS. And when men have options, they no longer have to get married to have their sexual needs satisfied. And when men no longer marry women? Then women can no longer steal a man&#039;s money and assets in divorce.<br /><br />Oh yes, we men have figured out finally just how cold, calculating, vicious, and evil you women truly are. You women are not capable of love. You only fake love, because the man has some material benefits he can offer you, like money.<br /><br />Women do not possess a sense of morality, or integrity, or character. They are vicious cold creatures who simply think in terms of how much they can extort from men.<br /><br />Of course you women will HATE on me for saying this stuff so openly. But you cannot deny it, because you KNOW it is TRUE.<br />

				Dude, maybe if you stopped treating them like fuck-holes they would stop leaving you.. I really don&#039;t know what else to say.<br />Also, the gay thing.. you still sound like a good candidate. If you will fuck a machine or a Taiwanese prostitute, why not get off wiith your drinking buddies.. you guys could bond over how useless women are. And the best part is you don&#039;t even really have to be gay!&nbsp; :) <br /><br />God I hope that weird muslim guy gets back to me about women in islam.. that was looking like it would be fun.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				Women have created vast armies of bastard fatherless children. Children who grow up without a father are like 5 times more likely to engage in crime. 80 percent of all criminals in America were raised by single mothers.<br /><br />So the bastard child army that has been created by single mothers is already starting to tear apart the foundation of society, of civilization, as we see an ever-increasing crime rate.<br /><br />Thus, women literally have become a threat to civilization itself, and MUST be replaced with Female Sex-Robots. Otherwise, we are going back to the stone ages, thanks to feminism.

				Well that is your opinion. I certainly do not consider a woman property. Maybe I did not explain myself clear enough.<br />or you misunderstood my point. That is just Islamic law. You asked a question a answered your question. My knowledge is limited I confess. <br /><br />Yes well about women strong true. But then why are there so little woman in Army combat units? The French Foreign Legion does not expect female recruits. How many female Marines do you know or in the Green berets. What is the reason? <br /><br />Look if some men are looking for VR sex robots a solution. Because some women are gold diggers. There must me something wrong. Would you not agree.<br /><br />Besides Islamic Law gave women right long before. Western civilization did.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Did you chose just to ignore this quote?

				I just found these two demos of the Oculus Rift VR headset. It looks fucking awesome.<br /><br />First one is a VR roller coaster ride. 2nd one is a guy flying a helicopter is 3D.<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hS6vPqAcLg<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HngrXgDS5Ws&amp;list=UUhQx9wj3OQX5VQd4gK9NKsw&amp;index=4<br /><br />I also went to their website and looked up how much it costs. You can buy the developer kit set for only 300 dollars. That is cheap as fuck. I was thinking it would be at least 1 or 2 thousand dollars.<br /><br />https://www.oculusvr.com/pre-order/<br /><br />The dev kit comes with the VR headset, as well as a few demos, and the software and game engine, so that you can write your own games.<br /><br />Maybe someone here would like to buy the dev kit and develop the world&#039;s first 3D porn game? You&#039;ll become a very rich man.<br /><br />I found a couple of more videos of demos for that Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. They look very nice.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKoSALEaV28<br /><br />Second one, the guy is using some kind of controller which acts as hands in the virtual reality environment:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07IwxUD8N8E<br /><br />Man, that is freakin&#039; awesome. Imagine using your virtual hands to squeeze some chick&#039;s tits, or to finger some chick. Oh waitaminute though. If you are using both your hands in real life to hold the game controllers, that leaves you with zero hands to jerk off with.<br /><br />This has a ton of potential. Who here wants to buy the developer kit and be the first guy to successfully create a virtual reality porn program? You&#039;ll become a millionaire.

				So what is it that you know that everybody know. Like I sad from your words I gather that you dont know anything. Well if you dont know any thing about any thing then it would be wiser just do dont talk about things you know nothing about. <br /><br />And me supporting John Rambo. If the western society has come so far that men need the invention of sex robots <br />there is something terrible wrong with western society. He makes good points and.<br />Like in case of divorce the wife get most of the money and custody of the children, with some father ending up never seeing there father. That is wrong <br />I only support the good points I dont do no way support prostitution or pornography because I find that disrespectful and dis grading women. <br /><br />And try to stay respect full. Everybody else tries.<br /><br />may ignorance be your bliss for now and you undoing later.

				Rolling just keep on Trolling. <br /><br />So why do you not recognize Muslims as human? Is it because we see satan obviously your god As our enemy. <br />Know the promises he is making you are a lie. I had a lot of personal dealing with him and he is a lair.

				Did you every read to Quran? If you did you would no that the stories have similarities but by no means the same. Or ones again you speak with out any knowledge what so ever?<br />Did you knew the life of the Prophet Muhammed is the best documented life of any person. Proven by no-Muslim scholars. And if you say that it is made up you have to base it on some prove if not you are just <br />repeating words some one else said.<br /><br />And by no means is it an insomnia cure. Quite indeed the opposite when I recite the Quran in Arabic I just cannot stop. And have read it at least 24 times and I am still reading it. Its a book that never gets boring.<br />

				Yes I agree that most Muslim do that are backwards. But although most of them are backwards not all are.<br />There enough smart people amongst them. I have a lot of Muslim friend with an college of university level education that convinced that Islam is the way to go and want a state ruled by Islamic Law. That what some believe does not make him backwards. What does I ask you. <br />The reason why most Islamic country are lagging behind on the western world has a lot to do with the oppressive governments they are ruled by. Because those governments are just puppets of the NWO. And taking bribes for cooperation and preventing the people with good ideas developing and starting there own industries. <br />And that most are intolerant and ignorant stems form the fact that they lack knowledge about there own religion. And do not follow the example of&nbsp; there Prophet how was very tolerant.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				but why have government and religion linked? WHY?!?! we got a name for those folk round here.. religious fundamentalists. it&#039;s generally not the brightest who blindly follow the outdated word of fictional characters and centre their entire lives around it. i have a lot of friends who are university educated too and they&#039;re still thick as shit, i wouldn&#039;t be using that as a measure of intelligence so much as daddy&#039;s bank balance.

				The governments that rule all of the Muslim world are not Islamic. There dictatorial and the laws are based on the European and that is the reason why there is a civil war going now in Syria. And why there was a revolt in Egypt. And the Egyptian people wanted an government ruled by Islamic Law but that party was excluded from democratic election. So you see how democratic some countries are. <br />And you greatly misjudge the Islamic scholars most of the are the brights people you will ever meet. Some are doctor. Like for example Zakir Naik beside being a scholar he is also has a PhD in medicine.<br />And what you consider fictional and outdated some consider revelation for the Creator and its laws fitting for all times. And some follow blindly because there father are Muslims. Other like myself, revert to Islam because they are convinced its the truth for the Creator. Because Islam is as religion of reason and not of blind faith. Then if you look out the Islamic golden age you fill see that a lot of important scientific discoveries were made during that time.&nbsp; <br />And to end if I may quote form Murphy&#039;s law the point where you stand dependence of where you sit.<br /><br />

				I dont know where it got derailed. I know that this tread is about sex robot. Its that John Rambo made a statement about being fed up with women and the way women that the wealth of the husband and children. <br />So I pointed out that maybe Islamic Law was a solution for him. And then this whole religious argument started.<br />And I promise to refrain and keep the religious debate in the proper tread. <br /><br />And about the sex robots I dont think its a really solution. Its like taking painkillers the pain is gone but the problem remains
