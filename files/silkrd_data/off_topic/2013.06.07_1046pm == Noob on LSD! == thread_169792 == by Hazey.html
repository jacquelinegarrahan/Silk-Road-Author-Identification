				POSITIVE MIND, Tripsitter, something nice to do... For me, I prefer to be outside during a trip because i get the feeling that I am trapped when I go inside or am in a small room.&nbsp; Drawing with charcoal is fun but no dark pictures (my cousin was a dick and really fucked with me on my first trip).&nbsp; Music and observing a dark room is fun too! We went to a cemetary that was on the highest hill in the town but i have never been scared of cemetaries (maybe it&#039;s not for you).&nbsp; I would suggest a very nice environment like a party or something with lasers and lights.&nbsp; It is just important to keep a good mindset and not concern yourself with super complicated thought because that will lock you in them.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t suggest looking into a mirror or taking a very very large amount your first time. Good Luck!

				For your first time I wouldn&#039;t suggest it.&nbsp; Although if you feel that you need a little more visuals in your trip it can certainly help.&nbsp; Eventually there will be a point where you start to come down from the visuals and that would probably be the best time to smoke. Some people like to dive right into it, though i&#039;m pretty timid with new things so its whatever you think is best.

				Smoke a joint after taking a tab, have some benzos just in case. If the trip starts to go bad just take one and you will be fine.&nbsp; I would suggest taking one tab with a friend around to help you out.

				Don&#039;t be scared , embrace it , get nice n snug and comfy , low lighting - don&#039;t be anywhere with loud shit going on close by - have earbuds and your fave tunes close at hand .<br /><br />And when your really settled just lay back with some chilled music and enter the world as it should be seen - on lsd .<br /><br />And pass your hands close to each other and you will feel&nbsp; a magnetism that you never new was there - cool as fuck .<br /><br />Stay in doors unless you know what your dong and feeling really strong mentally .<br />

				There&#039;s a lot of hype around bad trips. I once had a very experienced tripper explain to me that sometimes &quot;bad trips&quot; are just misinterpreted. For example, let&#039;s say you&#039;re tripping. You begin to think of yourself as a selfish person. You become disgusted by yourself. You assume other people are as well. Before you know it, everybody is out to get you and maybe you panic blah blah blah. Maybe it was just an important lesson that got taken out of context. Maybe the acid helped you see you&#039;re a little selfish and its something you may want to work on. That&#039;s just an example of how psychedelics can create a bad trip from something fairly small. Almost if not all bad trips are from panicking so stay calm. <br /><br />REMEMBER: the three most important things are set, setting, and dose. That goes for pretty much all drugs. It&#039;s not&nbsp; just &quot;my opinion&quot; its widely accepted. Anyway, if you go for it, have fun!
