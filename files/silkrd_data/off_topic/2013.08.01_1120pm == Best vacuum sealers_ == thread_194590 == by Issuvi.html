				<br />Hey SR Vendors,<br /><br />I was wondering if I could get some opinions from vendors who use them about what the best vacuum sealers are.&nbsp; I want to send something to a mate, and you seem like a good knowledge base.&nbsp; What are your preferences?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Issuvi

				Skip the vacuum sealer and buy a mylar bag and a hair straighter. Vacuum sealers are good only for bulk, or when saving space is needed. They do nothing for smell.

This might be true for whole solid pills, but do fuck all for capped pills<br /><br />Also, a small ziplock bag inside a sealed mylar bag will &quot;keep everything tidy&quot; just as well. It depends on the chemical, but I believe most vacuum sealed drugs start to emit a detectable order in a matter of hours? If you&#039;re depending on vacuum sealers to protect against smell, you&#039;re going to have a bad time. <br /><br />Look, I&#039;m telling the kid hes better protected going and buying a mylar bag and a hair straightener, instead of running off and spending $70 on a vacuum sealer so he can ship one thing to a friend.&nbsp; &nbsp;If he has to pick one, it should be mylar 100%.&nbsp; I use a vacuum sealer when needed, and while they are nice, are not nessacary. Simply a added convenience.

I&#039;m about to buy a impulse sealer off amazon. The &quot;seal&quot; button takes about 10 seconds to heat seal the bag.&nbsp; Considering I have to seal and cut the bag about 3 or 4 times to get it small enough that I like it, its a huge waste of time.<br /><br />

				i believe the vacuum bag has to offer additional odor proofing, as the negative air pressure inside the bag would tend to want to pull air into the bag, vs letting air/odor out.<br /><br />to the OP - for a best odor protection i&#039;d use, as others have stated, mylar film with metalized foil on one side (look at the inside of a potatoe chip bag). Ordinary plastic will let moisture (and thus air/odor) premeate or migrate thru, slowly, but still will allow it. The potato chip mfgrs used plastic with metal foil on the inside surface as the metal foil deposit does a better job sealing the plastic.<br /><br />most of the vendors double and even triple vacuum bag their goods in mylar, what&#039;s referred to as MBB<br /><br />on the silk road market, look for PlutoPete - he sells the stuff in small quantities<br /><br />fwiw

				Vacuum is only used to reduce space, and stop things from shaking/rattling. If you don&#039;t need this function, then just get a heat sealer.<br /><br />All &#039;vacuum bags&#039; have what&#039;s called a MTR value, which is the rate at which shit leeches out of the bag.&nbsp; From memory, garden variety PE is only 0.X, whereas MBB&#039;s are typically 0.00X.<br /><br />Keep in mind, PE leeches enough odor for a trained dog to smell in 15 minutes of being sealed.<br /><br />Vac&#039;ing does nothing to decrease MTR.
