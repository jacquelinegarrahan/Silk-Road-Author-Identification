				.76 BTC is what, like $7 U.S.? Would you walk up to a stranger on the street and ask them for $7 bucks so you could buy drugs? Maybe you would do that...but I&#039;d venture a guess most people wouldn&#039;t because they&#039;d know it was highly unlikely to work and would make them look ridiculous and immature besides.<br /><br />People on SR aren&#039;t your friends, they aren&#039;t people that know you or care about whether you can acquire illegal substances within the next 12 hours. So don&#039;t expect too much, but good luck with your fund raising efforts, I guess.

				i see both sides of the equation. ya right now .7btc is worth $7... and would someone on the street ask for $7? HELL YES. would i? hell no. But if you&#039;ve ever been to any major city in the world you will see beggars/homeless people any city you go to. <br /><br />i understand this fellows situation though. Ive been there as a buyer myself. I would usually take a 2 or 3 fold approach. First i would PM the vendor telling them of your situation that u are off a little bit. ive had a few vendors send me up to 1.5btc that i was off because of stupid bitcoin fluctuations . the seller wants u to buy so if they have to give u a small amount of coin to secure yoursale i think&nbsp; they will. the 2nd approach i&#039;ve taken in the past is to use site like virwox.com which lets you buy up to $130 (atleast thats my limit now. it might be higher for other ppl but it started off only a $60 a day limit and quickly went up to $130 within month (2.5 weeks actually). charge that shit to your credit card, buy some Second Life dollars which u can convert to Bitcoins... the only problem i had with them was that I had to wait for them to manually approve the BTC withdrawal until they trust your account a bit more. i emailed/submitted a support ticket and within 1-2 hours they released the funds which wasnt too bad considering i just purchased bitcoins very quickly charged o my credit card!&nbsp; im not sure if they require manual processing for everyone or just me for some reason.&nbsp; If you decide to use virwox heres a little tip to save u some time... for some reason it makes u enter your Second Life screen name in order to continue. You cant continue if you leave it blank. But i dont play games let alone have a Second Life avator so i was stuck ... until i just entered a fake name in there. Yes thats right. For some odd reason they REQUIRE you to enter a value into the SL screen name field but it doesnt have to be legit. Enter ANYTHING in there and it lets you proceed. Atleast it did for me : )<br /><br />Take care &amp; be safe. NJ<br /><br />PS If LE is thinking they&#039;re smart and that they might be able to find something on me because i revealed that i use virwox, then think again. My credit card is a prepaid, untraceable card so dont waste my tax dollars on going down that fruitless road. Thanks piggies.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s not like this was .07 btc which is less than a dollar. $7 is way more than I&#039;d ever ask for on a public forum. Hopefully this loan actually gets paid back.

				Total noob here, so possibly being totally naive, but in reading sitamaja&#039;s posts, it appears he tipped the mods a coin awhile back -- granted, they weren&#039;t going for USD 11/per at the time, but I&#039;ll go out on a limb and say you get paid back 4tron -- and if I could give you a +1 I would, for your kindness and generosity, but that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />Maybe after I&#039;ve been scammed a few times I&#039;ll change my tune, lol...

				I hate to hijack a thread but i reckon i&#039;m in the exact same position possibly even sillier than the OP!<br /><br />An awesome new vendor just did a custom order for me after i told them how much btc i had in my account and they were kind enough to make the custom order for me.... but without taking into consideration the shipping cost which put me short 0.08btc!!!<br /><br />dammit! I really dont want to harass the vendor.... any other good souls out there that can spare 0.08btc?<br /><br /><br />ps. yes i feel like the lowest of the low hijacking a thread begging for btc :(
