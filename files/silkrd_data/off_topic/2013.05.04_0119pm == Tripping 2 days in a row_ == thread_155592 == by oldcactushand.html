				So I&#039;ll be going to an isolated place out &#039;in nature&#039; pretty soon and there&#039;ll be 2 full days where I can trip. I&#039;m gonna take lots of acid on the first day, but what to do on the second? Here are my choices:<br /><br />2CB<br />Mushrooms<br />DOM<br />4-Aco-DMT<br />MDMA<br />Acid (but not very much)<br /><br />I was thinking of eating maybe 3g shrooms (or maybe more acid) and taking some mdma. I&#039;ve never tried 2CB, has anyone done this in a natural setting or is too much of a stimulant? and does it work well with other psychedelics?<br /><br />But what I really want to know is what would you do?

				A little bit of acid on the second day won&#039;t do much since you&#039;ll already have tolerance from the first trip. Psychedelics cause a very rapid tolerance.<br /><br />I&#039;d take the shrooms &amp; MDMA, as you were thinking. Sounds like a nice idea. :)

				2C-B resembled acid in many ways, just much less of a mental trip, with an euphoria very much like MDMA not as intense. Since 2C-B has a steep dose-curve, and many people report significantly different reactions to doses. For some, 20mg is too strong while others will not feel much with under 30mg. I also heard that the same person can react much differently to the same amount on two different occasions.<br />You should try it on its own sometime. It&#039;d be safer to find out your ideal dose in isolation, and not a day after tripping on something else that tickles the same receptors.

				Acid the first day<br /><br />More acid and mdma the second.<br /><br />I&#039;m headed to a 4 day fest in a few weeks and my schedule looks like:<br /><br />Night 1: alcohol (moonshine)<br />Night 2: lsd<br />Night 3: more lsd and a little mdma<br />Night 4: even more lsd and more mdma

				Well, I think that 2c-b is pretty awesome outside.. and 2c-b combined with mdma is the tits.. That would be my day 2.<br />In fact I think that I&#039;ll go make that my day 1 later&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks for the responses. I&#039;m aware acid will not work as well the 2nd day and I&#039;m reluctant to &#039;waste&#039; it when it&#039;s so expensive. But won&#039;t the shrooms/4-aco-dmt be equally effected by having done acid the day before, or will the tolerance factor be a bit lower for these because they aren&#039;t exactly the same as LSD?<br /><br />@sirius, your post made me chuckle. have fun!

				Cross-tolerance between tryptamines is pretty strong. It will affect shrooms/4-aco-dmt to a similar extent.

Luckily I have the ability to pretty much sleep if I need to. This is pretty much my schedule for all festivals. Of course there is pot/moonshine/beer smattered throughout the weekend as well.

				Not sure how much this helps but one time I tripped on acid.&nbsp; Then the next day I smoked DMT in the morning was fairly decent, then I smoked DMT in the evening and BAM&nbsp; broke through to the core of existence, I think the fact I dropped acid the day before and the DMT in the morning opened some doorways or some shit cause I&#039;d done DMT a lot of times before that without breaking through.
