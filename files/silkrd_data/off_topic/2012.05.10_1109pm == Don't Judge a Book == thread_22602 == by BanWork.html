				I always try not to harbor preconceived notions about people but sometimes I unknowingly lurch into arrogance. Shortly after this happens someone periodically comes along who slaps me back to reality.<br /><br />The other night me and a friend visited some local bars, pretty quiet out so we ended up bar hopping. The third bar we descended upon had no atmosphere, the bar staff seemed rude and impatient, all their friends were drinking at the bar so service to mortals and other non-hipsters was somewhat lacking. This older gentleman comes in alone shortly after and we get talking to him; real nice guy who I shared a lot of opinions and philosophy with over the course of about half an hour, he was &#039;nearing 70&#039;&nbsp; but was somewhat coy about revealing his true age, after some good conversation we traded names and shook hands and he moved on.<br /><br />In the next bar we bumped into this gentleman again and decided we would get him a couple of drinks (kind of reminded us of our grandfathers). After some more refreshingly interesting conversation this guy invited us into the back of the bar for a cigarette, thereupon he withdrew a large bag of cocaine from his coat pocket and invited us for bumps, both confused and excited I immediately partook of said devils dandruff and was extremely impressed with the quality (for my area). I hope my heart is up for that when I&#039;m in my golden years&nbsp; :P<br /><br />p.s. I didn&#039;t ask for his source, really wanted to but it felt rude. Perhaps we will meet again&nbsp; ;D

				it&#039;s really amazing the kind of connections you make when you communicate with other people like you aren&#039;t afraid of them<br />like human beings. It&#039;s fucked that society has us all so frightened of one another<br /><br />one time I approached these ppl on the street outside of the bar I was drinking (completely hammered didnt want to make the trek in any fashion to my home) and offered to smoke them down all night if I could sleep on their couch<br />I&#039;m not really a sketch looking guy and they offered me a place to stay. To this day it boggles my mind

				So true, that story resonates with me, met some of my best friends (as total strangers) in underground techno clubs over a decade ago, you get chatting, share an MDMA experience and all of societies most established barriers are instantly disintegrated, forming life long bonds. Sure, i&#039;ve had one or two scary people come back to my place (lol&nbsp; ::) ) but there are a lot of good people out there, and i say that as a qualified misanthropist ;D<br />Certain drugs (in moderation) could heal our sick society, humans have known about the healing effect of chemicals for thousands of years, shame about the media brainwashing we are afflicted with in our time :-\
