				I made a topic with a basic request. I did not need your bullshit when you could just let the topic die.... It is not like you had to respond to it. It is not like it was my 2, 3, 4, or so on failed repeated attempt for bitcoins and if you did not say something you would see nothing, but my spammed topics.. I was serious when I mentioned 3 would help because as I did not mention it would help me with my final order. Y&#039;all go suck a dick and enjoy talking to each other about how cool you are being so secretive online I am going to spend the rest of my life somewhere else...<br /><br />Although I do appreciate the creators of the silk road for making this service available to everyone in the world for most any need as sometimes it is hard for people to even get a book with information that should be available to all or a baked delicacy without any drugs in them that another may be throwing away at night every day due to policies. The people who use this service and shit talk others for behaviors they consider potentially fucking it up for them should not talk because they have no right to complain not being the main players of this project and are probably doing many of the same things they are complaining about making it for these people to keep this service up for them.<br /><br />So I repeat thank you creators of silk road for the service, but I do not thank the community for such a harsh welcome that has put me off of this seemingly unfriendly community of speculative paranoid lone wolves. With that I bid you good day and will never log back onto the forums again.

				Regulars get REALLY tired of seeing begging threads dude,&nbsp; there are loads posted every day, that&#039;s why you got a bad reaction. <br /><br />Also 3BTC is about Â£21, average joe in my country would have to work about 3.5 hours to make that money. Would you go to a strangers house and decorate their bedroom for free? I don&#039;t make a lot of money so I have to save up to buy stuff from here, If I&#039;m 0.01 btc short for an order well its tough luck on me, I wont ask strangers for it because its my problem not theirs.<br /><br />Buying BTC is so easy, best thing to do is just keep funds in a reputable exchange and send them to SR as needed.

				I love the opening sentence, &#039;I made a topic with a basic request&#039;...basic request my arse. You are new here and have your hand out. If begging is a basic request, we&#039;d all be doing it.<br />Let&#039;s call a spade a spade here, you are bang out of line to be begging on your first forum post. People on here have to hold down jobs and pay bills and then they are lucky if they can buy some BTC to get their drugs.<br />I&#039;d re-evaluate your title in this thread if I were you, as no one here is being dicks, they are just being truthful!<br /><br />Wooooh, back to happy times for me. That was my biggest rant on these forums.<br /><br />I still love everyoen though!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U63RXgFktM

I say this because you are quick to hop on the Creator&#039;s dick and thank him a thousand times for what he&#039;s done (no doubt I agree with you on that), but you don&#039;t at all acknowledge the people who have made silkroad what it is. What you see here before you is all a result of the people&#039;s will. DPR did not make all those listings and all those drugs available to you, he simply gave us a way to MAKE it available to you (an amazing accomplishment no doubt). So to mock and disrespect the people who have contributed to the site you see before you, a group that YOU YOURSELF are a part of, is ignorance of what the silkroad actually is. Have respect for the Creator, but also have respect for those that inhabit the road and keep it running and growing. Believe it or not, they probably responded to you the way they did BECAUSE they are maintaining the safety of the road. They are contributing and trying to make it a better place for others. Sure they can be a bunch of assholes in the process, but at the very core of it all they truly are trying to help and care about the welfare of those around them.<br /><br />I hope this can put things in perspective for you.<br />~HH

				I fucking hate these begging threads. Have some fucking self respect. It happens to us all; the bitcoin rate changes and suddenly we are .5BTC short. Do you want to know what I do in that situation? I make a smaller order. OR I wait a couple days till I can transfer more BTC. With the price of coins as it is, half a BTC is like Â£3.50.
