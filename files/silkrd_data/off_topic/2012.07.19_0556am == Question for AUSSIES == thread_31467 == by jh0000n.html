				If I see something I dont understand I want to find out how it works....I have a question for australians. Why are prices for you guys soooo high compared to all other countrys? Does it have to do with your customs being very efficient or is it that you generally have a higher income per capita so the prices reflect that? I really hope its the latter and you guys just get paid really well.

				mate i know people around my ways paying 450 + for coke that is suppose to be half good..<br /><br />And even the mdma can be 400+ for good stuff on the streets (thats if you can find someone with it) ... when i can get that shit for $30/60 a gram overseas! as good or better then aussie stuff i have had my hands on<br /><br />I would say the main thing is lack of product here to be honest.. demand is high supply is low

				coke is easily $400 a gram here. before i showed my housemate the silk road he was paying $100 a point for meth. a POINT. that&#039;s 100milligrams. that dealer was a bit of a cunt though. <br /><br />i often fantasize about setting up a vendors account and just selling to my fellow australians. seems too easy to be true though?

No idea why you&#039;d buy from the street after learning how to use SR. All it takes is a bit of patience and foresight to order what you want ahead of time, rather than in the moment.

				It&#039;s the same reason that we pay 3 or 4x what Americans pay for cars.<br /><br />Market economics. <br /><br />Things are worth what people are willing to pay for them regardless of how ridiculous that is. There is a supply at a certain price and the demand will pay that price, so the cycle continues.<br /><br />Anyone who tries to flood Australia with $50/gram coke wouldn&#039;t last long - due to other market factors (organised criminals/gangstas, government etc)<br /><br />Most drugs here are of fairly low quality and people will still pay top $$ for them.<br /><br />I tell you, the last time i was in the USA on business we were going out to dinner at top restaurants, drinking like crazy and buying more coke than we needed for ~$100 a night.<br /><br />$100 doesn&#039;t even touch the sides where i am. You can easily spend $70/ head on a very mediocre meal.<br /><br /><br />SR is starting to become a lot more expensive - more losses, poorer quality product than was available months ago, lots of fuckwits.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				As all your posts so far have wonderfully illustrated, Australian economics is indeed interesting. But that&#039;s the thing about good ole economics, it has a tendency to have a mind of it&#039;s own (funny that) and really just change it&#039;s mind w/e teh fuck it wants too. One of the many reasons I love the study of it&nbsp; ::) <br /><br />Anywho, If you view Australia in the context of the global economy (the mostly above ground one lol) and you track our performance over the last oooooo 20 years say, you will see Australia has hovered in the 1-10 % of the majority of the cool ranks in the developed world. How have we managed it? Was it just dumb luck? Was it through prudent planning and efficient execution? Did the pollies not fuck up too bad and make a good decision now and then? Was it all riding on Asia&#039;s back? Was it actual hard work paying off? Some degree of all these things and certainly choice more. <br /><br />Now that we are traveling&nbsp; down the silk road into the glorious future of our dreams (and some of our nightmares) Australians will respond in the usual way: we&#039;ll sit here on our arses having great ideas of how to fix it, have a beer/shot/cone/line/Ithinkugetthedrift, call someone a cunt, cos fuck it he was bein a cunt, forget what we were talking about till some guy pipes up and then we get back to business. I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way tbh&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So dont worry Australia, we&#039;ll get there, just get off our bums and get to it!<br />
