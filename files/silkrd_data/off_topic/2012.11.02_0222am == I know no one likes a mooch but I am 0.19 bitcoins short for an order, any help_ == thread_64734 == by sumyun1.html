				Got heavily taxed through the process of getting bitcoins to SR (which many of us experience). I need 0.19 bitcoins which is about 2 bucks to complete an order that I have been looking forward to. Any kind hearted SR users out there want to lend a helping donation?

				CaptainMal, I did not mean any insult at all by my post, thus the reason why I would never have used your name negatively. I did not accurately account for your service fee (which is completely fair due to the professional and easy service you provide), so I came out a tad bit short for my desired order. I really should have worded my post differently now that I look back on it. But nonetheless I do apologize and hope that we can continue to do business in the future.

I was unsure which one it was appropriate for. I can assure you I am no scammer, I am just simply scrambling to place an order that I came up a tad bit short for. Sorry about the way I went about it, I now realize it was a little unprofessional. Hope you can understand where I am coming from.

				thank you CG for saying i have been doing a good job :) my main motivation is trying to keep members from being scammed so that means a lot to me. i think you are providing a valuable resource to the community and are doing a great job as well <br /><br />SY, i personally dont think you should stop using the forums - especially now after receiving assistance through them. everyone makes mistakes especially when they are new so its understandable and no one will remember in a few days. i think you should support the community though - like review the order you place with those coins, answer someones question, or even just give your opinion to contribute... just my opinion - but that way the next time you need some help on the forum you will have given something to the community you are coming to for assistance. <br /><br />even i have given members loans as well as asked once if someone could help me with a small amount to complete an order that was extremely important to me since coins had dropped so much, but being an established member makes a big difference and i repayed the member extra for his help

				i cant imagine how frustrating it must have been trying to please everyone and handle the exchanges while being unable to connect to SR especially for so many days in a row. members probably dont show the appreciation you deserve but I know some would be completely fucking lost without your help :) they wouldnt even be able to order lol&nbsp; <br /><br />fortunately thanks to DPRs efforts im sure you will have a much better day today<br /><br />by the way, if you could mention whenever you think you have spotted another shill acct possibly used to scam people i would be extremely grateful if you could share that with me. the more eyes out for them the easier to prevent the scams. thank you<br /><br />and dont know why i said CG - you know what i meant...&nbsp; CM<br /><br />+ 1 for your assistance, generosity and contribution to the community
