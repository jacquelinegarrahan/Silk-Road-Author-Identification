				hey people, im a new member and after exploring the site for a while now, i think im quite close to making a purchase, the only thing is i dont know BTC prices, i have determined that a BTC is approx Â£7.50 can anyone confirm this? based on this i dont think that the prices are that different to the UK on land market but the quality is obviously much better? anyone who would like to help introduce me properley and maybe give me a few pointers i would be very grateful. <br /><br />JOHN

				There are quite a few trading sites for converting BTC to/from fiat currencies (including Pound Sterling). All will show you what the current exchange rate is.<br /><br />To your comment about prices, I can&#039;t speak for the UK market, but I have found that prices are generally 10-20% higher than street costs. As far as I am concerned, the premium paid is worth the security and convenience that Silk Road provides.<br /><br />I suggest that you find yourself a few providers of whatever it is you&#039;re looking for, look at their feedback, check these forums for any reviews, and then try them out until you find one or two that you like. In my case, I have a couple of weed vendors I use, and several others for some of the other psychedelics that I like to consume.<br /><br />For a buyer, the only major differences between buying on the street and buying on the road are the inconvenience of acquiring BTC and the delay between placing an order and getting your goodies.<br /><br />And finally, welcome to Silk Road... May all your adventures here be high.<br /><br />- Bit<br />
