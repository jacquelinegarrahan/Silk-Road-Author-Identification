				I am just wandering how much is this flag worth? It&#039;s 5 foot wide and 3 feet tall. It has 3 sections that are 1 foot by 5 feet each. The sections are red, yellow, and green. It has a marijuana leaf in the center. Under the leaf is the word marijuana written in red. It has a grommet hole on the left in each corner like a flag should have. One member told me it was worth maybe 30 bux. Would there be any interest in things of this nature here at SR?<br /><br />I&#039;ll post a new picture of it later today when I have access to a camera

				Given the obsession with security and privacy on SR, I&#039;m sure we&#039;d all love a huge marijuana flag to hang out of our windows. You don&#039;t by any chance also have a huge neon sign that reads &#039;I&#039;m a freaking drug fiend&#039; do ya?<br /><br />Only jokin&#039; dude. Sure there&#039;s a market.

				&nbsp;:) lol no but thanks guys for your input. I&#039;m an advocate for the legalization of marijuana. It is my belief that those who lobby against a creation of God has brought on his wrath in the form of the many plagues that have been proven to be preventable and curable with the use of marijuana. So i would love to sell items like this in an effort to fund the revolution. Who would it hurt the most? Big tobacco and alchohol companies, Medical companies and insurance companies, and the DEA (america&#039;s cartel). How can they make something illegal that you can pick right from the plant and ingest? <br /><br />How much of the American tax dollars are being wasted because marijuana is illegal? Billions per year. How much taxes are being paid yearly by medical marijuana dispensaries? Millions per year<br /><br />So what kind of person is against the legalization of marijuana? The kind that has been raised to be against drugs and puts marijuana in the same category as meth, coke, and heroin and LSD, all man made drugs.This person has never tried marijuana and has never heard any real facts about it.
