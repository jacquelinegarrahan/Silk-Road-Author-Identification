				I think I feel like daytripping today.<br /><br />But I&#039;m not sure how much I wanna take.<br /><br />I have albion&#039;s beatles, some of his mickeys, and some of those shiva&#039;s he had at my disposal.<br /><br />Most of I&#039;ve ever taken before was I think somewhere between 400-600 ugs, but I&#039;m not sure of the exact dosage because it was stuff I picked up in college. That trip kind of went bad because I was a noob who didn&#039;t pay attention to set and setting. I&#039;m tempted to attempt to shoot that high again, but a little apprehensive after living through that trip.<br /><br />I have yet to try the beatles x2, or I was thinking about maybe two or three of the shivas since I have been tripping off the beatles lately and that&#039;s laid with different crystal.<br /><br />How much trip do you guys think I should eat? I&#039;ve been doing about 200ug about every other week (sometimes every week) for a month or two now and having a blast of it.

What is your logic?<br /><br />For I always figured it the other way round because if I take more I feel like I&#039;m more noticeably tripping and get paranoid going outside and being around people.

				I&#039;ve been eating away at&nbsp; a sheet of albions beatles myself. 600ug seems to be the sweet spot for me. <br />It&#039;s not too intense to where I&#039;m just floored laying on the ground but I can lose myself if I want to.<br />Also gives me the feeling of one with every thing, it&#039;s just the perfect dose for me. I suggest you try it out.
