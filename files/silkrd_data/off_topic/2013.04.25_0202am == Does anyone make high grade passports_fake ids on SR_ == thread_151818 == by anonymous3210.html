				I got a fake UK driving licence off googleyed. The paper counterpart was of high quality but the card was visibly different from a real one, the printing was unclear in places and it was a lot thinner. <br />ACE

				Getting caught with fake passports and drivers licenses is a pretty big felony, atleast where I come from. So I wouldn&#039;t just walk through customs with it just for the fun of it to see if it works. I would only suggest getting one if you feel you &quot;need&quot; one. With that said I would also like to know if any vendors have legit USA passports.

				It is a very tricky thing.<br /><br />And there are always various levels of which a forged document will pass.<br /><br />It is something many have asked me for, and I am working with others in my game to see what can be done.<br /><br />I will keep you all posted.

				I&#039;m trying to find one for my little brother when he goes to Amsterdam. It doesn&#039;t need to be of amazing quality, but if anyone knows where I can get a passable one for Amsterdam, let me know!

				Fake ID&#039;s are generally easy to obtain, they sell for about $200 with a secondary document. Passports are much, much harder to obtain and much more expensive. I have seen them offered on a drug forum once and they cost over $10,000.
