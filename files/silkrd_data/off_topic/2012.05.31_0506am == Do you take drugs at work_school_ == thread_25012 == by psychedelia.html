				Sometimes I take a milligram or two of 2C-P for breakfast because it&#039;s a powerful nootropic at such low doses. Way better than the fucking methylphenidate I used to take for my ADD. With 2C-P I can concentrate even on the most boring lectures at university.

				The previous nights of partying drafted over the next day I had to work. I was rollin&#039;, smoking, and drinking and no sleep. I walked into work and suddenly blacked out and realized I was on the register, trying to ring up a customer. Got called back from the boss and sent home.

				I pretty much stick to adderall at work. I&#039;ve done methylone and heroin while at work, but I find I can&#039;t really focus on what I&#039;m supposed to be doing, and I actually like my job a lot, so when I&#039;m not able to focus I just get bored

				I used to go to school stoned every now and again, but I had a pretty low tolerance so if I overdid it by even a little bit I&#039;d generally have a pretty miserable time. I&#039;m mostly into psychedelics now and I wouldn&#039;t dare do them in a public setting, I&#039;m nervous and jittery looking as it is :p

				I occasionally smoke in between classes and sit out on the university lawn if I have a long break between classes. Yesterday, for instance, I smoked during the 4 hour break between my histo class and anatomy lab.<br />I never take drugs (besides my prescribed ones) at work, since it&#039;s a total buzzkill to be high in the hospital, surrounded by doctors, nurses, patients, who can probably tell you&#039;re high, not to mention it&#039;s extremely dangerous (obviously).

				As a teenager I used to work at this restaurant as a &quot;line cook&quot; and would literally get drunk. At work. And nobody ever noticed. And not just 1 or 2 shots, I would really get my drink on. In retrospect I know it was irresponsible but I hated my job, I hated my bosses, and I didn&#039;t care if I was fired or not. Plus I was (surprisingly) good at handling myself and it made work fun&nbsp; :P Even more surprisingly, I didn&#039;t grow up to become an alcoholic. I don&#039;t even like drinking thaaat much, but this job sucked ass. <br /><br />I also did DXM once when I was working at a movie theater (again, as a teenager). I ended up doing wayyy more than I intended to and I felt reallllyyy weird. All of the customers appeared really ugly and really fat (they probably were to be honest haha) but it was such a freaky experience that I never did DXM again. Since then I have also stopped doings drugs at work because now I have jobs that I actually care about/require me to use my brain.

				I noticed when I go to a class high, I just want to leave.&nbsp; I cant stick it out the whole class time.&nbsp; I was pt on adderall in high school unfortunately.&nbsp; It helped my grades out, but it has done some damage to my heart.<br /><br />When I go back to college, I am not going to class high or stoned.&nbsp; Only after class and after studying =)
