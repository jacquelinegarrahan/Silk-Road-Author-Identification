				Alternate translation:<br /><br />I&#039;m 30 years old, and have exceptionally bad skin and the demeanor and mustache of a child molester. I&#039;m not permitted around children after I was caught rubbing up against them in Wal-Mart. I have rape fantasies involving the sick, young, weak, and elderly. I&#039;d like to have analingus with my uncle again. His salty butthole reminded me of my Dad&#039;s. I have a micropenis and have had sex with dead bodies. Under my flowerbed you will find the bones of two dogs and a retarded person I kidnapped from a bus station and chained up in my basement for a decade and raped made him have tea parties with me while wearing pretty, pretty dresses that belonged to my Mom. That lampshade? She should have been honest with me. I loved her so much. Now she&#039;s mine forever. THE STUPID... FUCKING WHORE!

				its not the experience you have with stims of course, you know, everyone reacts different bla bla....&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;i have been doing synthetic cathinones over 10 years now (on and off of course - until i found SR last year than its FULL ON) with no problems at all, barley even comedown from days of binging, we have been very good to each other. surely not psychotic or anything ever.<br /><br />but let me snort few grams of good coke and on the comedown i wish i would die, no to mention that get mad paranoia. (not that it stopps me from doing that from time to time)<br />same for me on weed, makes me feel like i got schizophrenia.<br /><br />but meph (or cathinones if to be more accurate) is the best high for me at least - a high with the qualities of all stimes coke,MDMA and speed all mixed and balanced togather,<br />just need to be moderate (something i never am) since its shitty chemical that is more addictive than anything else and i have no idea if the long term effects will make me grow another head or something cause its not around long enough&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; <br /><br />You know how drugs... works different for different people,&nbsp; obviously people who reacts badly to a drug should not use it,&nbsp; but as you probably aware its not the case for everyone as there are quite alot of meph trade going around :)

Depends also if any event etc... see the meph threads, my nasty habits been discussed there quite a bit<br /><br />@followicculus -&nbsp; thats the reasonable thing to do of course, i would have done the same if i wanted to give some drug a second chance, its obvious with any drug that some wil love it and some will hate it or have better or worse reactions to it,&nbsp; like with K,pcp , psychedelics or many RC&#039;s ,&nbsp; so it not a big deal to have some drug you don&#039;t get along with and write it off, I try new stuff all the time, and less than a handful of drug were ones i bothered to try again, not to mention use on a regular basis... Last week was pentedrone.<br /><br />Anyway finsihed my meph and now a break, lets see when i will fall asleep... LOL

				Funny I actually tried something an acquaintance told me was pentadrone the other night.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I really did very much and I was already drunk and barred out of my gourd so I didn&#039;t really even notice anything.&nbsp; A couple hours later I had already forgotten that I had even done anything like that and was sleeping like a baby.
