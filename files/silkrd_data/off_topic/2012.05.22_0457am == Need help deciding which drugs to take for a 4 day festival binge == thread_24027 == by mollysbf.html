				I currently have plenty of molly which is awesome and all moonrocks. I also have 4 Lucy pez and .5g of M1 from same gonzo. I have an overwhelming supply of 2ce, 2ci, 2cc, and some 2ct7. I also have 10 of Skyys pink starts and some dmt. Should hopefully have some MDA within the week also. I am wanting to know what people think would be the best way to do this festival right. I love dancing and there will be plenty of bands to help with that but I know I will be wasting the molly if I take it every night and I have heard that M1 doesn&#039;t have such a quick tolerance issue like mdma. I guess I am just looking for some experienced users ideas. If you had all this in your hands how exactly would you spend the 4 nights? The first night there aren&#039;t many bands playing because I have early arrival tickets but I&#039;d prolly take it easy that first night so it would really only be 3 nights of raging. With a LOOONNNGG drive the day after it all. I would consider myself experienced but would just like some info seeing that I haven&#039;t tried my 2ct7 and being where I am from I think this Molly will surprise me quality wise.

				Would love to try some ghb but don&#039;t have any coins and don&#039;t really want to order any...I&#039;d take a sample though lol. That sounds like a good lineup though. So is mixing a small amount of 2ci with the molly a bad idea, say 10-15 mg? Remember I am looking for combos so that I can dance all night long... I haven&#039;t even tried any of the 2ct7 I have is that stuff worth a shit?

I loved the feeling, very euphoric and a full body high, something I&#039;d love to take in a setting where I&#039;ll be talking a lot, but I don&#039;t know about using it as a replacement for molly as far as dancing.<br /><br />I think methylone and some 25i or lsd together would be stellar though.

				Last year I was at a 7 day festival.. tried for 3 days to get some dope but eventually gave up.. Ended up doing a 7 day festival with nothing but beer and food.. and I have to say, felt like a pretty fucking huge accomplishment&nbsp; 8) Normally I take speed on every occasion, my friends didn&#039;t think I could do it so I proved em wrong AND had a great festival. Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br />I&#039;d take only a small bit of mdma every day, some 2c&#039;s maybe during the day for the laid back summerish-feeling and maybe a hit of DMT on like the first day just because it&#039;s freaking awesome.

				I&#039;m also interested in some of the recommendations you guys may have, as I&#039;m going to a festival soon too.<br /><br />OP are you talking about Wakarusa??<br /><br />I&#039;m going to an even next week, Showing up Wednesday, leaving late Sunday night or early Monday<br /><br />I have about 200mg of MDMA for one night, about 2g of mushrooms, about 60-80mg of 2c-b split between 3 caps, and a couple grams of Kief. <br />I have two grams of Ketamine on the way, I&#039;m hoping they get here before i leave. I&#039;m thinking at least one of &#039;em probably will.<br /><br />My buddy has some 5-MEO that i tried the other night, I kinda dug it, i might hit him up for some. <br /><br />I dont know the order i&#039;m going to do the drugs. I don&#039;t wanna eat the MDMA the first night and be exhausted, but there are some bass-heavy acts the first few nights that i would love to roll for.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not all sure when to drop my psys...<br /><br />I plan on doing K throughout ahaha <br /><br /><br />Fuck a plan though, i&#039;ll just show up with my drugs and play it by how i feel.

				If I was having a 4 day binge I&#039;d do, Speed,Meph,Coke, LSD. I&#039;d save the acid till last... make sure I&#039;m in a good setting and make it a memorable trip&nbsp; 8)
