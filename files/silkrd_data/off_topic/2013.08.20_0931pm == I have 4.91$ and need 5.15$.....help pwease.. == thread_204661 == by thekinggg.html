I would have told him that there is actually a whole thread for exactly what he was asking for..and not to post these shitty request in this forum. But they never listen :)<br /><br />Either way...glad you helped him!

				I agree with you. I am not fond of beggars, but he messaged me and was quite grateful. I don&#039;t mind helping out, I do have boundaries though. You make an EXCELLENT point though RxKing. <br /><br />Ryno

				So.. I guess this is the wrong place to ask for $00.02 until &quot;my brother Eyegore straightens up &quot;?<br /><br />Did I hear a drum-roll?

				You guys ever seen that &quot;spare some change&quot; south park episode where the homeless invade the town? SR is kind of like south park, a few people start to see that people are willing to give out free money if you just ask, and suddenly the whole first page is full of people asking to &quot;spare some change.&quot;
