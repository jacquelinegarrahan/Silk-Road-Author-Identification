				I&#039;m sure some of you can relate. Whether it be nosey parents, or curious spouses or even children or other relatives who call you up to tell you that your package from Germany came. Or asks you what you ordered in the mail thats getting shipped to you from Sweden. Or wants to let you know at the dinner table in front of everybody that you got something funny looking in the mail from Poland. <br />I never had this problem when i had my own place but I moved out of my apartment after my car accident, as I cant really afford to pay rent with my current job..<br />I usually tell them to mind their own goddamn business, except when its my parents.<br />My parents mean well, i guess they just wonder why i get random packs from Europe every week.<br />Does anybody have nosey spouses or parents who can relate?

				Yes, I can totally relate to this. I&#039;m yet to&nbsp; think of a reasonable excuse/reason when curious house members ask questions. Especially when its an express envelope. &quot;Mind your own business&quot; makes me sound even more suspicious....lol.

				Lol express envelope is easy if you only get them one time in a blue moon. When she asked why i got my express envelope i&#039;m like wow American express credit card ppl are on their shit! I csll in yesterday to tell them I lost my credit card and they overnighted it to me!!<br />Its those random packs from like Czech Republic or Spain&nbsp; with the funny looking stamps that have no return addresses on them..<br />I think I&#039;m only going to order domestic or from UK from now on, until I get my own place again

Then my sister looks at me funny when i always have to borrow her phone charger.. But i lose all my shit all the time so its not too weird. The worst stealth ive gotten was when i got a letter from a &quot;Soil analysis company&quot; when i bought some pot from SR. Mom asked me what the package was and I&#039;m like oh those are my pot seeds, I&#039;m trying to grow marijuana! i said it so sarcastically she just shook her head and walked out. After that, i ordered some bhut jolokia seeds online from amazon and planted them next to her garden and now my mom is so happy when i get these packages from this soil analysis company, she thinks im gonna surprise her again lol

				yeah seeing as &#039;mind your own fucking business&#039; isn&#039;t a good idea why don&#039;t you just say you&#039;re buying cheap crap off eBay for your mates that don&#039;t have an account.<br /><br />

				eBay, Amazon, RAM for your computer. Make something up. It&#039;s not that hard. <br />Now.. if your packages are leaking MDMA powder then.. probably change vendors.<br /><br />Or get a PO box. Or get the mail before they get to the mailbox? Smuggle it inside of your clothes when you&#039;re coming back inside your home?<br /><br />Or tell them its drugs and convince them to get high with you.. might work.<br /><br />Oh the simple worries of teenagers.. if I only that was the biggest concern/stress in my life..

				I get things and free stuff from all over the world anyways.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to play it off as stickers for a company, a replacement part for a pc (anything technical is good if you know more than them), or address verification for an obsessive site.

				I order so much shit off the internet my parents don&#039;t even ask. I would just come home and packages would be on my bed. (legal stuff)<br /><br />I just moved back in with them and I&#039;m not getting any drugs sent to their house. I have plenty of friends who owe me a lot of favors, time to start using them lol<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere
