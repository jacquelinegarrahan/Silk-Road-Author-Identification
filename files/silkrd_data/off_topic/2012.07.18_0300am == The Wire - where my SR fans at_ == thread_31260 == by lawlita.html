				I have just been catching up on Breaking Bad actually. Terrific show, the plot is rather predictable, but the performances and production value is top notch. As for new shows, Dexter and Boardwalk Empire do the job quite nicely&nbsp; ;D

				Real story is he wanted to a do a 6th season that was gonna focus on the Latin influx into the city ... but he couldnt find enough real insight.<br /><br />In each season the Wire had alot of &quot;consultants&quot; that gave the show a real feel ... Little Melvin, the real reporters from Baltimore Sun in S5 for instance.<br /><br />When he couldnt find that, they decided not to do a 6th season.

				Breaking Bad is fantastic but it&#039;s still a second to The Wire, best thing ever made. Generation Kill is by David Simmons as well, boss mini series as well.

				I just watched the whole series recently: fucking brilliant! Season 2 was my favorite, with the dockworkers&nbsp; and the Greek and all that. Gotta love that Omar and Bubbles. Sheeeet! I just watched Sopranos yesterday and saw the actor who was playing Omar in The Wire. Didnt saw that coming. <br /><br />Probably the best series IÂ´ve seen. <br /><br />&quot;This is like your Amsterdam or Switzerland or whatever where drugs are legal. Well call it Hamsterdam!&quot;&nbsp; ;D

				The Wire was definitely good, gotta love Omar, but you cannot beat The Sopranos. Hands down, best show ever. I&#039;ve just started re-watching it :)<br /><br />I&#039;m also enjoying Breaking Bad (just watched S5E1... M60 anyone?) and Sons of Anarchy at the moment...

				The Wire was WAY more realistic than the Sopranos which was real life but a parody of all other Mafia movies.<br /><br />Omar was great but so were the cops, especially the partnership of the black and white guy<br /><br />The young black guy who eventually took over the throne was good, the story a real story as the big dealers start off young and in the USA many will kill wheras the UK its more knives and so on.<br /><br />Sopranos was funny as hit. Love Paulie. Felt sorry for the fat guy who got caught in the gay club - Tony never wanted to kill him but the evil Bro in law watched him beaten to death with a pool cue up his ass. That led to the murder of some guy busting balls.<br /><br />USA make some good TV.
