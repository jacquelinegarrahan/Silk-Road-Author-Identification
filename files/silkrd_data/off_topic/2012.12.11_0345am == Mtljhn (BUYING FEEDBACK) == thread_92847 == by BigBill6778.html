				OK people this is what I don&#039;t like <br /><br />Mtljhn was banned as a seller they still allow him to access the account and send emails so earlier he sent me a text that says he is going to fuck my FEEDBACK which till 5pm I thought was impossible.<br />Earlier today my FB was (96%) at 5pm when I logged in it is at (91%) I don&#039;t know how he fucked with it he only made 3&nbsp; or so purchases so that shouldn&#039;t affect it that much I am figuring he has contacted some of my customers and offered them some free grams if they would change thier FB numbers this would be the only way he could do it.<br /><br />Anyways this guy is like a BEDBUG makes you sick to see them and you have to move and leave everything behind and buy new

				Hey Bill, contact SR support and tell them that John is blackmailing your feedback/rating and you would like his feedback to no longer affect your displayed rating. Because that&#039;s what he&#039;s doing(we all know it), and he&#039;s a wanker. But, the rating is weighted by item weight not sheer number of transactions, so... what this tells us is that he is roughly 5% of your transactions. But hey... that&#039;s not really a lot of fuckery, right there. Go check your feedback, you&#039;ll probably see some of his delusional-wanker rants.
