				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Willard Fucktard Romney (better known as &quot;Mitt&quot;) is an American businessman and android who is in the process of buying the office of President of the United States. As soon as the check clears, he&#039;ll have the nigger evicted and restore America to its old embarrassing shitkicking self. Basically sometime in early 2012, the Republican Party realized that all their favorite candidates were too stupid and corrupt to even beat a black guy, so they settled on a Mormon android with no personality or convictions. Seeing as the majority of Americans hate Barack Hussein Obama for reasons both real and imagined (mostly imagined), Romney should have little difficulty in becoming the nation&#039;s first non-human president. The only problem is that Romney is a Mormon, and thus believes that when he dies, he and his wives will inherit a planet in outer space, where they will have endless celestial sex and bear many space children. Mitt Romney is for giving laptops to people and giving away free college. Why? For the lulz. In related news, Romney has been the subject of many flame wars on Republican blogs for flip-flops on abortion. He is loved by such Republican fags as Mann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity, even though he introduced a universal healthcare bill in his state that was identical to Obama&#039;s. But let&#039;s be honest, it was okay &#039;cause he ain&#039;t no nigger. Did we mention that he&#039;s a motherfucking MORMON?!!! No seriously, he&#039;s a goddamn MORMON!!!<br /><br />After running a shitty failure of a campaign in 2008, Romney returned to the political scene in 2011 to prove to the American people that even a faggot liberal Mormon is better than a black guy running the country. Unfortunately Romney forgot that Republicans (and people in general) still did not like him and he watched for several months as political trolls Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum all got more votes than him. Eventually the NASCAR fans, child rapists, and business criminals who make up the GOP realized that Romney was their only hope to beat President Porch Monkey and they agreed to give him the nomination under the condition that he keep his magic underwear and other batshit beliefs to himself. As President he has promised to be both for and against abortion, gay marriage, and Obamacare. There has been much speculation as to whom Romney will choose as his running mate. Obviously he won&#039;t pick one with a vagina because that didn&#039;t work out so well last time. Some possibilities include: Noted fat fuck and governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, neoconservative beaner Marco Rubio, and homosexual Christfag Rick Santorum. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I love the internet....and fuck Romney! Gary Johnson or Ron Paul ftw! ;D
