				Once released,<br />I rose up and decayed into little pieces<br />then everything blew away<br />leaving infinite peace<br />revealing everywhere through space and time<br />unveiling the concealing by my human mind of what&#039;s whole<br />many bodies and kinds yet one soul<br />in my vision our division appeared clearly separated <br />then it faded away, alleviating my fear and pain

				I&#039;m sitting through a vast array of yellow and golden zebra stripes. <br />Everything seems more colorful and bright. <br />Tints of green escape my sight.<br />The floor&#039;s expanse feels like a sea. I burst open reality. <br /><br />Honestly, the color blue could not even begin to describe this. <br /><br />Sorry if the poem&#039;s a bit too obvious! :) Looking forward to more from you guys!<br />

				a have a few poems that hold a lot of meaning to me =)<br />i wrote this one after my first blast-off/first psychedelic experience <br /><br />trees and leaves, life that sways<br />center the mind to SEE what it says<br />for this lack of knowledge,<br />and numbness to reality<br />can hide the balance between light and darkness, to see<br />that they are one, working together<br />to create the friendship<br />that encompasses all life, and all purpose<br />and notice that the &quot;real world&quot; is worthless<br />in itself<br />for it is sin and hell<br />disguised<br />as to what we should be experiencing,<br />with more than our eyes. what lies beyond these 5 &quot;senses&quot;?<br />(what some would call, the idea of senseless, embodied?)<br />it is as simple as to read<br />a poem. the familiarity seems to open the mind<br />to these things that are always around us<br />and seem to surround all time<br />anticipate the decimation of the idea of time and place<br />and realize that it is all one<br />all vibrations come together to create this single, unified intelligence<br />to shatter patience of the weak and the numb.<br />to the world that is populated with the dumb.....founded<br />so i have to ask<br />how did<br />the ones in charge find a way to ruin this for us<br />to keep us trapped<br />as prisoners of THEIR mind, and time<br />no need for a rhyme, just a real message<br />to eliminate the bullshit<br />and create what is the essence<br />of a soul and the presence<br />what is one<br />what is all<br />never to fall for it is too strong<br />and to be contained by other humans<br />seeming so obviously wrong.<br />and occurring for so long<br />they are completing the balance FOR me.<br />i need darkness, so that i may shine<br />without darkness, it would all be light<br />which, in reality, cant seem right<br />it is something we shall fight<br />and follow our heart with<br />follow our soul<br />to capture the ultimate goal<br />of all. all is a balance that creates this world around us, utilize the tools you have been handed<br />major disappointment awaits those who wouldnt have it<br />i can see<br />to some<br />seeming like a stab, into the heart<br />but that is only your human instincts that are becoming dead<br />exiting the world and becoming in your head<br />and out of boundaries<br />we stride<br />to the rules we cannot abide.<br />without ever having a need to divide.<br />&nbsp;ultimate love, and appreciation for the balance<br />be carefull about the worldS around us. for inside of the soul<br />it is seeking to drown us

				Just remember, <br />the flame doesn&#039;t have to touch that green to ignite it into a curling sheet of red.<br />And that pill I threw up, eluded my throat for my ever-swirling head.<br />Where to tonight?<br />What girl to bed?<br />Fucking philosophy; what happens when were dead?<br />Blahhh, step off. Onto the shag rug instead.<br />Preferably on that glowing ash burning to the roots of its thread.
