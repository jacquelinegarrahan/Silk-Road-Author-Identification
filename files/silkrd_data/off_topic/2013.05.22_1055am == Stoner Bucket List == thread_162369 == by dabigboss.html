			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve decided that I want to make a bucket list of sorts.&nbsp; Basically, a list of goals, activities, and dreams related to marijuana that I would like to achieve, or make reality, before the day comes when I will no longer consume weed... which is most likely the same day that I die.&nbsp; Please share anything you would put on your own &quot;Stoner Bucket List&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d love to hear some of your ideas.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep updating this as time goes by.<br /><br />Stoner Bucket List:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Eat pot brownies at Disney World. <br />2.&nbsp; Smoke with an on-duty police officer.<br />3.&nbsp; Amsterdam.&nbsp; Nuff&#039; Said.<br />4.&nbsp; Try my luck growing.<br />5.&nbsp; Smoke 8 blunts by myself in one session.<br />6.&nbsp; Make a 5 person waterfall-bong using a 10-gallon water container,tubing, and a large socket.<br />7.&nbsp; Take a hit from a bong taller than me. (6&#039;3&quot; or 1.92m)<br />8.&nbsp; Get head while I lean back and smoke a dooby.<br />9.&nbsp; Watch the Northern Lights in person while smoking Northern Lights. <br />10.&nbsp; Get my mom high.<br />11. Get blazed on a beach in a Jamaica. <br />12. Toke up at Bob Marley&#039;s grave.<br />13. Smoke on a ski lift in Colorado.<br />14. Eat a box of Girl Scout Cookies while smoking a bowl of Girl Scout Cookies.<br />15. Smoke a bowl of Christy Nug&#039;s nugs. (less than one month away)

				yep there was 2 on duty with us but only one smoked and we were also trespassing on private property at the time lol, one of the weirdest stoner circles i&#039;ve been in.<br />i don&#039;t think i&#039;d want to trip while actually riding a camel, it&#039;s really uncomfortable and i&#039;ve never even tried mescaline in any environment! could be nice to trip out in the desert though under all the stars just chilling with some berbers then retiring to a bedouin tent :)<br />speaking of tripping if anyone&#039;s feeling a bit silly when you go to the airport, eat a load of shrooms/acid before security and then come up as the planes taking off, it is an amazing feeling.. only if you can handle yourself without being bait!

				I did the Jamaica thing last summer bro, It is great. Weed is all around for dirt cheap prices and smoking with Robert Nesta Marley and his fam (they are running his small home town, and shrine) is a truly spiritual experience for the true schmoker.&nbsp; You definitely want to go to an all inclusive and pay for a driver to bring you to Nine Mile to see Bob, do not try to drive yourself, it is dangerous.&nbsp; An all inclusive with a nice supply of green and the crystal blue seas is fantastic.

				jamaica will be done if i don&#039;t drop dead before i get the chance. weirdly feels like i&#039;ve been there before when i enjoyed an hour+ hallucination that i was lying on a beach in the sun there smoking a j rather than a hotel in the netherlands. kinda want to go colorado to see how they pull off legalisation next year but nothing else appeals to me that much about the states apart from music.. they really do get the best tour lineups but it&#039;s just so much effort/money for my general indifference. they better have jet skis aplenty in jamaica i want to smoke a spliff on one. adding that to my list. and yeah bucket list or not i don&#039;t find anything remotely appealing about heroin which is the reason it doesn&#039;t make the list of things i want to experience in my life. tried opiates enough to know i don&#039;t like them, don&#039;t need to progress to a postgrad in smackheadology. each to their own.

It is way cheaper than I thought it would be to go there, all inclusive is def the way to go though. I really want to take a trip to Denver myself. I love being an American and we have great spots all over the country; but our dumb ass drug laws and other polices are bull shit. I&#039;m sure a libertarian like Ron Swanson understands lol
