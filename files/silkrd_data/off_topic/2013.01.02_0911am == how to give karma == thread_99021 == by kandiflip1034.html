				I havn&#039;t been on the road long.&nbsp; Maybe 3 months or so.&nbsp; Just started making purchases about a month ago and only lurked the times before.&nbsp; Now lately I have been at a minimum browsing the main site daily and at least reading a few posts here and there trying to educate myself. One thing I was wondering though that I havn&#039;t come across is how to give someone +1 karma.&nbsp; I have come across may posts where I feel the person deserves this but I have no clue how to do this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please let me know how to do this if you come across this post.<br /><br />Thanks sr community

				Not 100% sure but I think you have to be a senior member and than it just appears? And I think it take 100 posts to become a snr member.

				You&#039;ll have the ability to give karma when you&#039;ve become a &#039;Full Member&#039; at 100 posts, when this happens you&#039;ll find two links under every members karma a [thank] + and [discourage] -, you&#039;ll be able to give karma once to each member every 72 hours. Hope this helps you :)<br />Edit: kandiflip1034 read this post http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=174.msg693729#msg693729 you should not be using java based programs such as igolder as the keys they generate are too short to be secure. If you want to learn PGP download Gpg4usb, pm me and I&#039;ll help you.

				Thanks for the great responses. Finally mad eit to jr member so I guess I have a little ways to go. Assuming this is obviously a safegaurd to keep people from makeing throwaway accounts and giving their real account +1 karma.&nbsp; &nbsp;100 posts takes a while.
