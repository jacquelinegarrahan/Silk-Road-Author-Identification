				http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page#Drugs<br /><br />Interesting stuff.&nbsp; SR is off the page completely now, it seems.&nbsp; And there is a section now that is &quot;Verified Vendors&quot; or some shit like that.&nbsp; Has links to 5 people who are confirmed to be legit, supposedly.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, there&#039;s one that stands out in particular.<br /><br />Aerie - http://dfx3opddg6fcdxvi.onion/index.html<br /><br />Supposedly the BEST MDMA vendor around.&nbsp; So I go to reviews, and I notice an interesting link.<br /><br />SR Review Thread (Goes Down Sometime)<br /><br />http://n255hzjhv262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10685.0<br /><br />If you replace the URL with the actual SR Forum link, the dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=10685.0<br /><br />It links right to Pfandleiher&#039;s forum page.&nbsp; Interesting, right?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if anyone noticed this or not.&nbsp; I tend to be late on finding things like this, but I figured it&#039;d be kind of interesting to talk about.

				I don&#039;t trust Hwiki at all.<br />I have no idea who can edit this page, but there have been SR-phishing links, paradoxum (known scammer), Eris is 99% scammer too and he&#039;s on top in &quot;Editor&#039;s picks&quot; ffs...<br />Also someone keeps deleting SR from the list. I m sure a lot of people have been scammed because of this legit-looking page.

				I&#039;ve been checking the Recent Changes every day in hopes of good finds, but all it has been is edit wars between rival vendors in the commercial categories. Accusations of scamming followed by erasures thereof by the scammer in question and counter-accusations erased by the original accuser and so on. I don&#039;t mind that though since there&#039;s no better site than SR for purchasing the kind of goods on Tor that I care about.

				Well, those other vendors don&#039;t bug me as much.&nbsp; I already figured they were all the same person.&nbsp; And I&#039;m sure all of them are scams.&nbsp; But the one that threw me off was Aerie.&nbsp; I think that guy might be Pfandleiher.&nbsp; Or someone claiming to be him.&nbsp; Interesting stuff.<br /><br />Worldwide Supply seems to be the ONLY one that might even be SOMEWHAT legit.&nbsp; But even so, I&#039;d rather just stick with SR where there&#039;s escrow and a good source of many products.&nbsp; =)
