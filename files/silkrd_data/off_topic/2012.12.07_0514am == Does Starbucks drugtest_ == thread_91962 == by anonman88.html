				so, i&#039;ve applied to work at starbucks. while i know many people may be angry at them for their corporate tactics, they treat their employes very well, and money is money. so, i was wondering if starbucks drug tests their employes. i&#039;m currently clean, in the fact that i&#039;m not smoking weed, but i&#039;m curious to know if it would be safe for me to start smoking again, even if just once a week. if starbucks does drug test, its really not even worth it for me to start smoking again, which i have no issue with, because i can still take LSD :) any info about starbucks drug tests policies in the US would be very appreciated :)

				I had an acquaintance that worked at one for a while. He didn&#039;t need to pass a drug test to start working there, but someone either got hurt or they got suspicious of a drug problem and announced they would test soon. He quit though so I&#039;m not sure what ended up happening. My job at a hospital required a clean drug test to start, but I&#039;ve been there over 4 years and smoke every day, haven&#039;t been tested besides the initial employment one. Most low key service jobs don&#039;t really test unless there&#039;s a suspicion or you&#039;re injured on the clock type deal. Since you mainly do lsd anyway I&#039;d just lay off on the weed for the first month or so you have the job. Drug testing is an expense companies like to save if they can, so you should be fine. Within the first 3-4 weeks you should have a pretty good sense of whether or not it&#039;d be something to worry about.

				If Starbucks does drug test their employees, that would be incredibly ironic considering their main product is a drug that is both more harmful and addicting than marijuana. I&#039;m sick of hypocrisy in this world.

				I have a bunch of friends that work at SB, and they all do drugs all the time and never get tested. Come to wok high, smoke on break, smoke on lunch, smoke on break, come in to work still tripping/strung out etc, etc. No one cares. Obviously this is just 1 location.

				My friend works at Starbucks and did not need to pass a drug a test. A lot of places don&#039;t drug test however like someone also mentioned, if you get hurt on the job then they can drug test you. They test you because they don&#039;t want to give you work man&#039;s comp because its more money out of their pocket. If you test you and you turn out to be positive for some drug then they can say they weren&#039;t liable.
