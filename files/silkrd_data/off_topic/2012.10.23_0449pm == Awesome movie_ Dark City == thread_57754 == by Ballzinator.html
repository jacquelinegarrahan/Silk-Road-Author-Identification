				Ya, I&#039;ve seen it in theaters back in around 95. Very trippy. It is also very beautifully shot and visually appealing. A very great but very underrated movie...

				Dark City is fucking awesome.&nbsp; I watched it a few years ago and was surprised to learn that Keifer Sutherland had to voice in the beginning on the vhs/dvd version, because americans didnt understand the story without it.<br />Check it out, true story.<br />Plus the lead actor is british, originally made famous by a tv adaption of Cold Comfort Farm.<br />Then he was in Dark City THEN Fantastic 4.<br />Good for him eh.

				The whole memory implant thing in this movie was the best idea i had seen in a long time.<br />My only downside to this whole movie was Keifer Sutherland.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen him play shit parts before but this took the biscuit.

				Fair do&#039;s.&nbsp; I have to watch it again anyways, its been a long long time since i last saw it.<br />However a lot has happened with Keifer Sutherland since, especially with 24 and he was great in that, minus the facial twitching.

				&nbsp;^<br />what he says...<br /><br />Encryption is useless for anonymity as it merely attempts to &quot;mask&quot; the type of data being transmitted in order to avoid throttling by the ISP. Which is useless with deep package analysis. You will always broadcast your IP to the tracker and the swarm. TOR = useless for BT, so are most VPNs, aside from the fact that most private trackers do not allow their use as it will get you banned in no time. Lets not forget that for the amount all the good VPNs charge, you might as well get a Netflix subscription. Unless you want to download from the PirateBay with 45kb through a VPN.<br /><br />Anyways, BT encryption for this purpose = fail.

That&#039;s why I said, if you want to mask your ip use a remote proxy. The BT encryption will protect your traffic from being ID&#039;d though.&nbsp; DPI could well reveal the type of traffic it is, but the specific content and who owns it? How? In any event I don&#039;t think ISPs are deploying DPI at least mine isn&#039;t because like I said I stopped receiving cease and desist letters after forcing encryption without having to use a vpn. Nor do I see any reason they would spend more resources to deploy DPI for the riaa and mpaa until they&#039;re mandated to by law. If you think otherwise though I&#039;d be interested to hear why.

				Sin City do you mean ????<br />I thought it was the biggest waste of time since i dunno, The Phantom Menace.<br />I couldnt wait for the dvd of star wars TPM but when i got it , i watched ten minutes and thought that the idea of going to get drunk was much better.<br />The only good thing about Sin City was Clive Owen, he still rocks.

The most well known I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen like Minority Report, Blade Runner, and Total Recall. Then there&#039;s his less well known but still IMO good flicks like Paycheck, Next, Impostor, Adjustment Bureau, Screamers.<br /><br />Just saw this dystopian flick the other day Handmaid&#039;s Tale set in a polluted right wing religious totalitarian state. Very dark vision of the future, which I like. Speaking of dystopia ... Equilibrium with Christian Bale was a mainstream flick whose Fahrenheit 451/Brave New World/1984 themes made it an instant cult classic. I&#039;m sure there are some others I&#039;m not thinking of at the moment.
