				New semester at college. More fresh pussy from high school, more parties, but there&#039;s always that thing you have to do to get good grades... We all hate it, but it has to be done :(<br /><br />I&#039;ll start. <br /><br />Your brain is usually most active during a certain time of the day, schedule your studying time for this. Are you usually up all night for some reason<br /><br />Schedule a time? What are you daft?! No actually, I&#039;m not. Setting a time mentally prepares you to be fully engaged into studying without your mind wandering. <br /><br />Turn off the television, computer, and music while you study. Why? Two reasons; first your brain may be more stimulated when you have these things on but won&#039;t be able to absorb the material as well as it would otherwise. May be hard at first, but it gets easier after a couple times I promise. Second, it&#039;s scientifically proven that electronics emit beta waves; beta waves make your brain more dormant so you don&#039;t want that during study time... I suppose the tin foil hat on your head might take care of that though&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Eat some quick brain food to boost your study yields and occupy your manual fixations, albeit shortly; apples, bananas, and nuts provide you with B vitamins, the &quot;brain&quot; vitamins, and nuts also occupy your manual fixation--apples also release choline which help process B vitamins faster.<br /><br />That&#039;s all I got for now, keep &#039;em comin!

				I heard there was supposedly a better video lesson site other than khan academy, anybody hear about it and have a link? Going through video lessons before I pick up the book has helped a lot, not with actual comprehension but stress, if I walk into class with my shit together already then the stress doesn&#039;t crush me. if I have already memorized most of the subject then i can sit in class and relax(usually high) and listen to a lecture that just reiterates what i have already learned then everything is much easier. <br /><br />It works for me, it is all about stress reduction

It&#039;s a joint effort by Harvard and M.I.T. that sounds similar to what Coursea&#039;s about. They offer really good courses and even offer certificates. If you guys already have knowledge about computers per se, and don&#039;t want to go about getting a degree in Computer Science; you can take a programming class from EDx and you&#039;ll get a certificate from M.I.T. in programming if you pass it. :P<br /><br />Needless to say you&#039;ll easily get an entry level job from places that require any credentials
