				Workplace drug testing for amphetamines involves a examination of the urine to determine the presence of amphetamines.<br />Does anyone know if smoking (rather than snorting, swallowing, injecting or bumping etc) will lead to amphetamines in the urine ?<br /><br />I ask because perhaps not, given that the drug goes straight into your bloodstream and avoids the stomach.<br />However, perhaps the kidneys filter the blood and deposit any unmetabolized amphs into the bladder.<br /><br />Anyone know for certain ?

				Dalmata&#039;s exactly right.&nbsp; You can often &quot;pass&quot; these tests if you have a legal script of adderall, as they&#039;re able to tell whether it was a pharmaceutical or clandestine source (I believe it just costs extra money and a little extra time/attention, but don&#039;t quote me on that part).<br /><br />I&#039;ve passed every drug test I&#039;ve ever taken -- not that I&#039;ve taken all that many, just random shit for employment -- and I was taking enough adderall those days to kill a small mammal.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even get questioned about it any of the times, either.<br /><br />It&#039;s possible if it had been desoxyn (methamphetamine, not amphetamine), they would have marked me positive or just gotten all up in my face with questions and stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really sure.&nbsp; But they can tell the difference between pharmies and street gear, that much I know.&nbsp; You can&#039;t really do amphetamines of any kind at anything but very low levels -- perhaps even sub-clinical -- and expect to pass your drug test(s) reliably.

				Good lord... all this work, just to catch little old me.&nbsp; People&#039;re so silly sometimes&nbsp; &nbsp; ::)<br /><br />They&#039;re right, by the way.&nbsp; That would catch me.&nbsp; Was lucky enough to have been dry of meth for at least a week every time I was tested, but it&#039;d sure catch me today.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely sure I agree with their strong interest in a racemic product... it&#039;s my understanding that a large portion of (USA used) cooks produce pure dextro-methamp and little or no levo-.&nbsp; Some do though, to be sure.<br /><br />It also occurs to me... &quot;greater than the total.&quot;&nbsp; So basically, all I have to do is make sure I go fucking insane on Vicks inhalers to totally fuck up the ratio of d- to l- for my test... and I&#039;m clean?&nbsp; Well gosh, Dr. Lab-guy... works for me&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />(I&#039;m just joking, of course, BTW -- don&#039;t really try this... though I guess if you&#039;re walking into the test still tweaked or something, fuck it, could be worth a go since you&#039;re fucked anyway)
