				i havent smoked for over 4 years now. and i plan to hit the shit out of the 2 grams of ice cool i ordered in a couple of days.<br /><br />so as an answer to your question: you will not have any tolerance so you will get high with less amount of weed than regular smokers. smoke as much as you like. it wont kill you.

				It would be insane to smoke 1g after a break of 2 months, at least for me.<br /><br />I would buy some sativa, with fruity aromas like lemon for example. ;)<br />And then smoke extremely small amounts, because it could be very interesting for you to see very low effects of very good cannabis, i think.<br />then after a few days you can get into CHRONIC mode and smoke huge bong hits every other hour, if you want to. ;D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i havent smoked for over 4 years now. and i plan to hit the shit out of the 2 grams of ice cool i ordered in a couple of days.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />4 years and then you buy the ugliest waste ever? please buy some serious weed, it will be your first experience since 4 years, honor it with the right set, setting and material. :-)

				I cut off smoking for about 4 months once.&nbsp; After I came back into it I was hitting like it was any other time that I smoked, and in about 5 minutes (after 1/2 a jay) I was out like a light.

				Like all drugs, you must try to control for many variables to optimize the positive effects and minimize the negative.<br /><br />So here is my &quot;Listening to Cannabis&quot; post.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D <br /><br />1) Firstly you must try to eliminate intake of any non psychoactive compounds.&nbsp; The best means of doing this is by using a vaporizer,&nbsp; and grinding the herb well.&nbsp; Ingesting edibles also works, but that takes much more product, and is more of a time commitment.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) Carefully measure the amount you use, start small, and take note of the amount.&nbsp; For somoene that&#039;s been off for a long while, I&#039;d recommend using something like 1/8th of a teasoon for one session.&nbsp; Finding a means of measuring such small amounts is challenging.&nbsp; I cut about 1/4&quot; tip off of a bicycle tire air cap as a reasonable measuring tool for this purpose.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) Carefully control the temperature of the vaporizer, and take note of it, as this will come into play as to what effect takes place.&nbsp; A good vaporizer will provide you with this information.&nbsp; Higher temperatures release more CBD type compounds, lower just THC.&nbsp; Both have a role in the effect.&nbsp; I generally use around 375 degrees.<br /><br />4) Try a variety of situations/settings, and also take note of your initial mental state before you begin your session.&nbsp; For example, try sitting around and watching TV, while vaping.&nbsp; Try playing video games.&nbsp; Try hanging with friends.&nbsp; Being outside, listeing to music, reading.&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; I find some strains are more amenable to some activities vs others.&nbsp; If you start with an agitated state of mind, it&#039;s probably not going to get much better with Cannabis.&nbsp; I actually find meditation is very beneficial prior to using Cannabis to start with a centered state of mind.<br /><br />Finally, after doing an initial set of experiments, adjust these variables, and note the effect.&nbsp; You&#039;ll almost certainly be able to zero in on an optimal means of enjoying the experience.<br /><br />Note that when you get a new strain, you may need to do some of these again.&nbsp; It&#039;s fun actually!&nbsp; <br /><br />By doing this, I&#039;ve been able to minimize the anxiety/paranoia effects and maximize the relaxing, invigorating effects I want.<br /><br />I only wish I had access to a wide variety of strains at all times (it&#039;d make it so much easier to zero in on the strain that works for me).&nbsp; <br /><br />Enjoy!<br />

I just think it&#039;s a good idea. But I had a recent break for much longer because I was sick, and have been sick for quite a while now. Smoking weed was not going to help me out.<br />I do use stimulants, but not too often. Weekly usage at the most. Every so often I might use a couple of times in a week, but not often. And I mainly use MDMA / Mephedrone / Amphetamine. Cocaine only every so often and rarely I use meth.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using weed for many years now, but I&#039;ve never had these problems. And I&#039;m no more paranoid than I usually am. I&#039;ve been selling weed for 8+ years without problems.
