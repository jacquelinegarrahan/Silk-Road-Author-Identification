				Hey guys &#039;n&#039; gals,<br /><br />I&#039;m a student studying at a University in the UK. I&#039;m currently writing an academic piece&nbsp; about Tor&#039;s hidden services.<br /><br />First of all - and let me make this clear - my study is NOT about trawling through the Silk Road to analyse its growth like the recent work of Nicholas Christin at Carnergie Mellon University (available here) -http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/TR-CMU-CyLab-12-018.pdf<br /><br />Whilst I&#039;m currently in the process of writing up a list of topics I&#039;ll be touching on (which I&#039;ll post up or PM to those who are interested) I would love to hear some thoughts on Tor, they can be anything that comes to mind. Specifically though I&#039;d like answers to the following.<br /><br />1.Why do you use Tor and hidden services? <br /><br />2. Do you think an academic study on hidden services is a good/bad idea, why?<br /><br />3. Do you think that the Tor Darknet has longevity? How long can you see it lasting?<br /><br />Finally, is there anything you would like to see included in an academic study on Tor? (I.E more about the positive sides of the Tor community etc?)<br /><br />You can either post it up here or send it to my email address which is listed with my signature.<br /><br />I would ask you all to PLEASE not write/send me ANY information that could identify you or your whereabouts. This is because I&#039;m not LE and to make the point I want to state clearly that I&#039;m not after personal data - If any of you have a better method of verification then please let me know.<br /><br />Also if anyone else is aware of any other darknet denizens who are taking on similar research PLEASE let me know as I&#039;d love to hear from them too!<br /><br />Thanks for your time and please feel free to ask me any questions you may have

				First of just a big thank you guys.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already had quite a few replies to my post by email (torgeek@tormail.org - please send more!) and PM&#039;s on Silk Road, seems like people prefer messaging me directly than sharing there thoughts on here. Anyway all these opinions are really helping me think harder about how I frame things and its really appreciated when people post links up too as despite being good at academia I am a bit of a Tor &quot;noob&quot; so explanations (preferably with big letters and bright shiny pictures ;) ) do help alot.<br /><br />Astor - I&#039;m aware of the bias issue of just asking around on the Silk Road, however I&#039;m currently just doing some homework to get a sense of what people think about things and I thought I&#039;d rather start by speaking to the crowd I&#039;m more familiar with. I&#039;ll be posting up the same questions in other places over the next few days to get a better sample. Good point though and thank you for all your really helpful feedback! If you&#039;re happy with it I may PM you after the holidays to ask you some more general questions about Tor but if you&#039;d prefer not then that&#039;s totally understandable.<br /><br />Also when you asked me:<br /><br />&nbsp;<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;d like to know if your colleagues in the CS department can identify a random hidden service of my choosing.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you mean identify as locating geographically? Cos if so I doubt it haha, but I&#039;m willing to speak to my various CS friends and colleagues and see if I can get the ball rolling on this one. PM me with more details and I&#039;ll see what I can do :) <br /><br />As for the rest of you PLEASE keep the replies coming in! I won&#039;t be replying directly to all unless I&#039;m asked to or I have a burning question about it so don&#039;t feel I&#039;m ignoring you if you don&#039;t hear back, all feedback -positive or negative- is really helpful.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br />

				I guarantee you they can trace it up to its entry guards if they have traffic analysis skills worth a damn. Why not for your study see how quickly you can trace a hidden service to its entry guards with an attack like the 06 Locating Hidden Services attack. See how much things have really changed since then. Then maybe try to find a way to get past the entry guards but that will be harder for that level of an attacker to pull off.

				Modzi - Haha I agree, great write up. Still need more opinions though so please write up anything you&#039;d add if you feel like it&nbsp; :)<br /><br />kmfkewm - Unfortunately computer science is not my field! I&#039;m much more Humanities focused so my study is more interested in the human dimensions of Tor rather than the technical side. Of course its impossible to talk about Tor without talking about some aspects of the technical side -PGP, Bitcoin, analysing holes in security etc - but I can&#039;t do a whole study on its vulnerabilities. I will however talk to some of my computer science colleagues and see if they think that such a study is doable and whether or not they&#039;d undertake it :)

				Astor-<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve posted up in HackBB and BMR. I&#039;m going to do UMB and Intel Exchange later because of the nature of random things that go up on there but if you have any suggestions for solid forums which may give me better feedback then I&#039;d love to hear them. Please PM me with any that come to mind.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t realise you were being facetious! I feel a bit stupid now, not a great start for an academic haha. But if it is a pressing issue than I am happy to challenge my CS department to the job. Can think of a few people that would be up for the task including a good friend of mine who was part of the team that uncovered the hacking of Gmail accounts by the Chinese a couple of years back, but can&#039;t promise they&#039;ll say yes. Its always worth asking though so I&#039;ll let you know what they say when I speak to them :)<br /><br />Thanks again for your help

				Am now back in the UK, expect an updated set of questions in a couple of days after I get settled. I&#039;ll also give you all a better idea of where I&#039;m going with the work. In the meantime PLEASE KEEP INPUT COMING IN! Again, I ask that you DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERSONAL INFO because A) I don&#039;t need it and B) I don&#039;t want anyone thinking thats what I&#039;m after, just a few answers to the questions I&#039;ve posted at the top and any other observations you may want to include.<br /><br />Just so people can get an idea of what others have said, here is the posts from BMR and HackBB and the replies that came with them. I will not be posting up what people have messaged to me personally for obvious reasons.<br /><br />http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/viewtopic.php?id=2335http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=11278&amp;p=56115&amp;hilit=academic#p55914<br /><br />As always, a big thank you to everyone who has written to me already, I haven&#039;t had time to reply to you all but for those who are expecting them I WILL get round to it so please bare with me :)

				Torgeek, you should try some general forums, not specific to drugs or hacking. These come to mind<br /><br />TorChan<br />http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/imageboard/<br /><br />TorStatusNet<br />http://lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion/<br /><br />OnionForum<br />http://65bgvta7yos3sce5.onion/<br /><br />Also, reddit has a subreddit called /r/onions. Full url is www.reddit.com/r/onions, which is a general forum for people interested in hidden services. I suggest creating a reddit account over Tor, which they let you do.<br /><br />There are more at http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page#Other_forums<br /><br />
