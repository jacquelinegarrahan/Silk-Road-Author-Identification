				Hi, folks, I wasn&#039;t sure if this belonged here or in the SR discussion thread.<br /><br />Basically, I&#039;m looking at the notion of using localbitcoin.com or localbitcoins.com (right now I&#039;m not sure which it is) in order to sell BTC for cash in person.<br /><br />I am baffled by how to approach someone in order to do this. I know it involves something like contacting a registered vendor via IRC, someone who has some measure of trust (there&#039;s s web of trust I believe).<br /><br />But I am stuck at the IRC thing, as I have tried installing the IRC client and trying to communicate and nothing happens. Also, I don&#039;t know how to get it going with someone once I do contact a potential vendor. I mean, it would be nice if this happened in the flesh so to speak. Because otherwise, I&#039;d be stuck with sending a stranger my BTC and then... what? How do I get the money? I certainly don&#039;t want to get a moneypak, cause how&#039;s that different from getting a moneypak from somebody at SR for example? And I definitely don&#039;t want to give out my name and address to get a money order either. I want true anonymity (except the part where he sees my face, heh.)<br /><br />I am very confused by all this, and I hope a kind and kanowledgeable soul may help me out(and maybe others who read this).<br /><br />Thanks, friends.<br /><br />goblin

I have an electronic device with internet access as does s/he, I show him/her the cash, we confirm the amount that I get, s/he sends the coins, I check my account and then hand them the cash. Done it a few times now and am quite happy with it. Good way to cash out if there are people looking around in your area.

				There&#039;s an escrow system on the website you can use if you want people to pay you through depositing into your bank or wiring to your bank you put the coins you want to sell into the websites escrow then he deposits however you want then you release, if you want to exchange cash you can meet face to face exchange cash then send a txt to the website to release the coins in escrow, if the blokes extra sketchy he can then check his wallet then once its confirmed you both go your separate ways!

				Hey, this is great you guys. I also know what I did wrong, I stupidly mixed up bitcoin-otc with localbitcoins. I had read on the botcoin-otc site and didn&#039;t get anything clear out of it, it confused the hell out of me.<br /><br />But now that I&#039;ve read a good deal on localbitcoins, I can see that it&#039;s not difficult at all. I&#039;m gonna give it a try real soon in my area.<br /><br />Anybody familiar with bitcoin-otc?<br />
