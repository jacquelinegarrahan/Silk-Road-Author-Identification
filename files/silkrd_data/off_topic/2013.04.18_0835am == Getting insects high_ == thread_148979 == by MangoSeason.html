				Sometimes while really high on drugs ill let a mosquito land on me and bite until the point where it&#039;s that full of blood it can hardly fly away and then proceed to laugh at how high it must be.<br /><br />Anyone else do similar things for entertainment?

				I&#039;m annoyed by mosquito&#039;s too much to just watch how these lil fuckers feast on me and get high for free and leave me all alone, used and itchy so no way.<br /><br />But +1 because I can see the entertaining potential for people who don&#039;t have a problem with this.

				this thread is so weird but in a sort of delightful way. i don&#039;t like anything with wings when i&#039;m high or sober. get out the sky. but yeah bees like to get drunk on fermented fruit stuff. sure i heard that.. of course from a very credible source like a medical journal or the ricky gervais podcast. my dog likes to drink stella. wife beater. my rabbit seems to like weed but i keep him away. he can have a carrot if he&#039;s lucky.

				There was this thread a while ago where someone asked why people do drugs and some guy said he does LSD:<br />- to learn valuable life lessons<br />- to be one with nature<br />- to see the beauty of the earth in all it&#039;s glory<br />- to get inspired for art or whatever<br />- and so on<br /><br />And here comes MangoSeason on LSD getting spiders all crooked, throwing flies in their web.<br />Just fucking brilliant lmao!

				Well aware of those studies. Have you ever seen the complexity of a spider&#039;s brain? They have very complex brains and one of the highest insect/arachnid brain mass to body mass ratios....<br /><br />That said, LSD simply acts as a toxin or neural disruptor, rather than some &quot;spiritual web making&quot;, man... far out. Have you ever seen a spider build a web on pesticide? Way fucking cooler.<br /><br />Stop wasting your lives.

I think psychedelics could do a lot of good in the world. I just don&#039;t want to open any of the locked doors in my head. I don&#039;t know why I locked them in the first place, but when it comes to me, I usually know what I&#039;m doing and it&#039;s best not to question why I did to me what I did. What little there is banging around in the open in my mind is bad enough, I&#039;d hate to see what was so bad that it had to be locked away. <br /><br />Plus, my paranoia flips shit whenever my senses start going weird. Weed is pretty much my limit when it comes to psychoactives. I have a very cranky subconscious, it doesn&#039;t like it when I start messing around with it too much. I figure it&#039;s better for me to apply my destructive tendencies towards making reality more bearable than using it to try and squash bugs that aren&#039;t really there. More productive that way.

				I fully agree with Chaos and Sirius. Everyone in the world should experience at least one really good LSD or mushroom trip to help open themselves up to themself and see the world from a better perspective.<br /><br />A good trip like that can completely rewire a persons preconceived beliefs about the world and change them for the better if they allow it to.
