				i agree but as a vendor u already risking it with scammers + getting caught<br /><br />i mean if it was like 15 bt i wouldnt mind tht much but 29bt !!!!!! <br /><br />thts way too much of a risk, i dnt even know the size of the market on SR <br /><br />I think SR should state about this fee in their agreement because it took me completely by surprise and by now iv invested all my money on weed and packaging&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />guess ill have to reconsider

				Stop moaning and don&#039;t be such a cheap cunt. If you are serious about being a seller then you would realise the price is actually minor for the amount of money you can turnover here. Either pay the price and start your business or don&#039;t. Don&#039;t bitch about it like a pikey. The fee is also to discourage scammers so you can&#039;t moan about that either.<br /><br />Jesus fucking Christ. -1 Karma and may God have mercy on your retarded soul.

				You should perhaps start as a buyer first... You need to see how it works, I&#039;m sure a few vendors will chime in.. But the market is a big as you want it to be.. Depending on price and where you will ship to, you&#039;ll find that the benefits outweigh the risks, but it seems like you&#039;ve not done enough research to me!<br /><br />Read up on the forums, read the wiki.. That&#039;s the first thing I did when I came here! - The fee is to stop scamming vendors... If you want a free account, go to black market reloaded, but I can tell you this, there are more scammers there! This place is moderated, scammers are named.. and vendors that scam are banned!<br /><br />Up to you mate... If you&#039;re put off by 30 bitcoins, you don&#039;t sound very serious to me!

A sellers account is actually cheap as fuck for someone in the U.K. Jonesy. Less than 100 quid because your money is worthless to us lol. ;) Anyway the point is that the fee is completely minor and anyone that moans about it even if it was just because they didn&#039;t know shouldn&#039;t even bother being a vendor at all. If you can&#039;t see that Â£90 is fuck all in comparison to what a goldmine this place is then don&#039;t even bother. Jesus. <br /><br />And our politics is easily just as interesting as yours Jonesy. Your system evolved out of ours after all and we have got to watch it fail ever since. :P

				I&#039;m sorry you feel like that scottishgreen, it&#039;s not really that much cash though, and seriously, if you&#039;ve product, you&#039;ll make that back easy... <br />An example is required i think... 25 bitcoin for 1 oz green, you could sell that on here @ 5 bitcoin a gram.. you&#039;ll have made it back after that first oz! at if you look at even new vendors 25 sales is a piece of piss.. <br />If you&#039;ve not enough stock, you&#039;ll fuck buyers off cos you&#039;ll have delays! You&#039;ve already got your equipment you say... <br /><br />Sounds to me like you need to go back to selling to your friends....

You don&#039;t even know your own country you ignorant fuck-wit. Jesus Christ no wonder Scotland has the biggest heroin problem in Europe, it&#039;s the only thing they are stupid enough to get right. <br /><br />1. The NHS is PAID for by tax and England and Wales&#039; hugely subsidize Scotlands NHS and schools because your tax wouldn&#039;t even cover the cost for your bill because you are a nation of drunks, fat pricks and junkies. We also pretty much pay for your higher education as well. I work in finance and look at the figures all the time, you&#039;re a nation of ginger freeloaders. <br /><br />2. When the Union breaks (fingers crossed soon) you wont be able to support yourself because Scotland&#039;s economy is fucking tiny and as a country has a GDP so out west you may as well be in Japan. <br /><br />3. And yeah, we may have a fuck load of debt but guess what ginger-tits? I don&#039;t pay tax so I don&#039;t have to contribute to paying off the debt. I&#039;d rather be in a nation with a massive debt than a country who thinks it can support itself economically when it can&#039;t and get&#039;s lied to by a fat, greasy shister like Alex &quot;The Cunt&quot; Salmond. <br /><br />Go and suck a bottle of Scotch Scotchie, you just got served. And I don&#039;t mean with either a needle, a pint or a deep fried mars bar which is probably what you are accustomed to.

				Scot if you sell competitively priced weed you will make back your fee in no time. I do agree that it should probably be mentioned in the sellers guide (if it isn&#039;t).<br /><br />If you want to gauge your market then post in the Product Offers section and provide details of your prices strains etc, then you can see how many people seem to be interested (alot more will buy that reply in forum due to people who just use the marketplace). Telling people prices is key though (at least for me).<br />
