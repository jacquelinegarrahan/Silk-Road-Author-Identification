				I&#039;d probably say go with acid, but that&#039;s my own bias since I haven&#039;t tried NBOMe and acid is one of DOCs.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get more with NBOMe since it&#039;s cheaper, but you can pick up 5 tabs of LSD with $60 pretty easily.

				you could get x25 25i&#039;s and get something else as well or just get the LSD. <br />Personally I&#039;ve only tried 25i, its quite alright but its difficult to sleep on, and I feel the trip always the same every time I took it. Don&#039;t get me wrong its not all that bad at all, but I hear LSD is much more &quot;spiritual&quot;, (I&#039;ve never tried it), and on NBOMe your head is a bit clearer. <br /><br />Its up to you, if you just want LSD, or you can get 25 NBOMes from DRgreenfingers for a good price at 1200ug per blotter and get some weed or some stims, maybe even 1 LSD tab with em to compare? <br /><br />Up to you man :)

				I would for sure go with the LSD. I&#039;m not a fan of NBOMes. Quality over quantity in my opinion.

				+1 LSD FTW<br /><br />LSD is the gold standard for psychedelics.<br /><br />I would *definitely* recommend taking it over a relatively new designer drug that a lot of people don&#039;t end up liking.

				<br />Ive taken acid for a couple decades. Lately I have been playing with the NBOMe&#039;s and love them. I love the C-it is nice an introspective yet a bit clear headed-take more than one hit if you want to really space out and go into your mind. Feel great the next day as well. <br /><br />The I is more heavy of a body load to me, more trippy as well-with I i can really get lost in thoughts and music-can still do this with all NBOME&#039;s.<br /><br />The B is even more strong to me. <br /><br />I have the D but have yet to try it. <br /><br />I love acid, shrooms, NBOME&#039;s, 2c-b, 2c-e. All are fun. I really enjoy the NBOMEs due to it not taking up my full day, but yet it feels like I have been gone a lot longer than the 5 or so hours. <br /><br />Acid is wonderful! Clear a full day for it. I feel more comfortable in public even by myself with NBOMEs---I want a sitter for acid or shrooms (make sure I dont get myself in trouble by drawing too much attention to myself). <br /><br />Buy couple hits of cid and 5-10 of NBOMEs together then you can try both <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Yeah, I would suggest trying samples of both (or more). If it&#039;s just spare money to you, you might as well try out a variety of new stuff.
