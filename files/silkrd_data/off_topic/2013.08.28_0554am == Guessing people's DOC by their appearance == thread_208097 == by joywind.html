				this is a game i often play and was wondering if anyone else thinks about it. i try to spot people who clearly are or were addicts and tell what their drug of choice (DOC) is or was.<br /><br />-- potheads look bored and talk low or mumble. they often have facial hair. <br /><br />-- dope fiends usually talk in a whiney or sort of gravely voice and often walk slouched back<br /><br />-- meth heads seem to talk whispery, very fast, and often jumble their words. methheads seem to still have a lot of energy even when SOBER. They still talk fast, talk a lot, are animated in their mannerism and body movements, etc.<br /><br />-- cokeheads and meth heads seem to have permanently wider eyes and more facial expressions and mannerisms/ticks<br /><br />-- drug addicts in general seem to scratch themselves a lot. <br /><br />-- people who roll a lot laugh in a very giggly way and generally seem very spaced out and almost sort of childish.<br /><br />-- serious psychedelic users are always spaced out and talking about how money/materialism/consumers don&#039;t really matter because we are all part of the same connected universe.

				I can&#039;t say I judge many by their appearance. As a member of Mensa, I have been fortunate to encounter many intelligent members of our species who do not choose to appear as though they are anything but rag pickers, nose pickers, and butt lickers. <br /><br />Upon closer inspection, and association, they are in fact not at all what they may appear to be to the average up and down with a jaundiced eye. <br /><br />None of us are anything but warm, wet, squishy, meat bags. Carrying about 3-5lbs of shite in our lower intestines. Unless one has had a recent colonoscopy. <br /><br />My gran was a woman of beauty, integrity, intellect, professionalism. (She kicked off in 2007.) She was also a functional alcoholic and addict. None outside of her private circle of runamok buddies ever knew of her proclivities to snort, smoke, bang, and ingest those oh so appealing substances that rearrange our brains.<br /><br />Moral of the story, &quot;Never judge a pile of puke by its undigested contents, but by the dead hippie lying next to it.&quot;
