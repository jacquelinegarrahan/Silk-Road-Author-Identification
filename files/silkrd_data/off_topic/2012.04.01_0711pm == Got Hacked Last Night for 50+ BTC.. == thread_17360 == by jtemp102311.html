				I have sent this to a bunch of my favorite vendors.. I just wanted to get it out to the community at large and other vendors that we may order from in the future so that our/my hard-earned reputation on the Road doesn&#039;t go into limbo.<br /><br />(Also, mods:: I&#039;m sorry to post in two topics.&nbsp; Just not sure where this belongs. Thanks.)<br /><br />-<br />Just letting you know that our account got hacked last night. (Jtemp102311) We lost almost 50BTC due to this. Quite unnerving as this is the first time this has happened to us.<br /><br />-<br />So, if you get any weird correspondence from this account please disregard it.<br /><br />Just in case this person is still able to get into this account we have created a new one with extra layers of security. This new account on SR is::<br /><br />c20h25n3oL<br /><br />The TorMail address to this account is::<br /><br />c20h25n3oL@tormail.net<br /><br />We would ask (an we&#039;ll remind you) that you use the great and established buyer feedback and reputation from this account (Jtemp102311) when dealing with (c20h25n3oL) and future purchases on the Road.<br /><br />We can provide PGP and PUB Keys for this new account if you wish.<br /><br />-<br />Thanks for your time and understanding.<br /><br />Have a great weekend.<br />J

				Sorry to hear that. I&#039;ve often wondered how often that happens. The login screen and not having an email or anything seems to lend itself to brute force attacks. Not sure if the system locks you out after x amount of wrong logins or not.
