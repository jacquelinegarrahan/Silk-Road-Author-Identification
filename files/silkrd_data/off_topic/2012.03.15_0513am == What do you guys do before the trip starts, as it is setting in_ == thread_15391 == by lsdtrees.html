				Watch a movie? Meditate? Chores? Shoot the shit?<br /><br />I am always looking for ways to keep my mind off of the questions that usually find their way in, like &quot;Is it working? did I take enough? what&#039;s this trip going to be like? bla bla bla&quot;<br /><br />When I took 2c-t-7 I started watching Fantasia 2000 and that was pretty fantastic as I hadn&#039;t seen it since I was young.&nbsp; The last song was the most visually pleasing part of the movie and it set the trip off to a good start.

				on acid the other night i listened to a state of trance on head phones while watching tron on mute, it was awesome, music began to get better and better. I always try to do something to take my mind off of the waiting for it to come.&nbsp; Back in the day I did mushrooms and drove to my friends house about 15 minutes away and i got there and began chatting and the drive made me forget about eating it, just make sure its a short drive. watching a good movie is a good idea too if alone, or shoot the shit with a buddy

				I usually listen to music with some good headphones on and sometimes meditate.&nbsp; I always keep a stopwatch to know how long I&#039;m into a trip though, always helpful. I love that feeling how one moment you&#039;re sober then the psychedelic kicks in and you get CEVs or OEV.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Also if you have a sober buddy that can drive you around, EVERYTHING looks amazing, especially in the evening.

				If its LSD or Mushrooms i smoke a bowl and hang out, so that way i&#039;m not focusing on looking for those first hints of the trip. <br /><br />If its DMT then i do some meditation, listen to some music, usually the Grateful Dead, maybe some Shpongle, then time for blast off

Have you seen the new Beavis and Butthead episodes? Those were incredibly well done, in my opinion.

				King of the Hill is my all time favorite TV show, and it is even more incredible and funny while tripping plus all the colors and characters look so crazy.<br /><br />I have actually seen a little bit from a couple of the new BB episodes and enjoyed them. I thought it was funny how they had B and B commenting on the new MTV shows too. I unfortunately havent really caught them on TV much though but hope to see more so I can actually determine how good they are overall. <br />

				Generally, my significant other and I have a short session of sex. By the time we&#039;re done we have the afterglow of intercourse as well as the drug kicking in. Highly recommend it.
