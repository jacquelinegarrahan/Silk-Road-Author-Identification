				What does your local herb man charge? Price and weight. Geographic location and if for resale or end consumption would also be interesting if comfortable sharing that.

				My doctors recommendation allows me to grow large numbers so my prices are as follows (top shelf cali medical grade) 200 oz, 750q, 2800full...for friends ill do the occasional 50 quarter but that&#039;s the true homie hook up...edibles contain .25 keif and I do a tray of 12 for 50 dollars...that&#039;s what I charge usually its just a hair more from the local weed slanger...my biggest competition sells for 220 an o

				£20 for 1.4g off one guy (does 4.2g for £50)<br />£20 for 1.6-2g off another guy, depends what he has in<br /><br />Just priced up a small scale grow that would allow for 4-5plants at a time (not grown small for a sea of green, grown to about 80cm), just priced up a small simple grow for 4 plants (grown to 80cmish, not dwarf Sea of green method), including seeds, compost, pots, lights (400w dual spectrum HPS, Cool Tube), fertilizers, tent, extraction fan + filter, came to £300 pounds. <br />£20 for 1.4g works out at £400 an ounce -.-<br /><br />If only i had a place to grow !

				£20 for a full 3.5g henry<br />£140 for a full 28g ounce<br />£1000 for a bar<br /><br />it&#039;s all homegrown, but my guy has some great contacts who know what they are doing so the skunk is nearly all smokeable - a few sticks here and there but hardly ever any seeds, and no leaves. all properly cured as well :) - i used to know a guy that sold full eighths, but once you dried it out you were left with a gram and a half. not with my current Dave though, you get a decent bag full for 20 notes. usually potent as fuck as well - a full 3 skin joint will do me half the night. i don&#039;t smoke half as much as i used to though so my tolerance probably figures into that.

				Hehe, it&#039;s nice to hear that the price of weed isn&#039;t only fucked up in my country &lt;.&lt;<br />Here, it&#039;s 20€ for supposed 1G(but you usually get 0,7-0,8g)<br />140-180€ for 10G<br /><br />And one usually gets outdoor grown, shit weed :x <br />That&#039;s why SR is really a breeze of fresh air for me :)

				Midwest US here.<br /><br />When I buy locally it&#039;s about 150 a half.<br /><br />The weed seems alot better locally around here than what I get off SR too. The weird thing I&#039;ve noticed though is that it doesn&#039;t stretch as far as it does when I buy off here. Not sure why, prolly because I go through a middle man who goes through a middle man and the bag ends up getting pinched along the way.<br /><br />So I stick with SR because social graces aren&#039;t exactly one of my strong points.

				Yes cheap on the west coast indeed. And I&#039;ve also noticed on sr weed is the one thing u don&#039;t wanna buy...I look at quality/price and my heart truely hurts for the buyer....having a growers habit I smoke about 7g a day so $120 quarters would be devastating lol....plus I know how mucj it costs to produce and anyone who charges more than $10/g should be locked up for rape and is a greedy fuck...sorry for the rant its just 6400 watts produces 12lbs every 55days if u know what&#039;s up. There&#039;s just no reason for such high prices

				Last time I bought it I paid £25 for a quarter ounce of hash, price ain&#039;t really changed in 10 years. Skunk is expensive tho, not sure what the £20 bags weigh but that stuff makes me feel like shit so I avoid it.

				Where I live, people buy &#039;25 bags&#039; (usually 1-2.5g weed, no one I know weighs their weed and instead rely on appearance) or &#039;50 bags&#039; (usually 3-4g). Ounces seem to be around $200. Most weed around here seems to be indoor hybrid and people don&#039;t care about strains.

				Here, in central Europe, weed goes from 10 EUR/g usually, or so I have heard (I have never bought on the street myself because of some friends and SR ;) )<br /><br />But for 10 EUR you get really shitty stuff, weed is not too easy to get, mostly hash is sold on the street.

				To those who live in states where MMJ is legal, you guys are spoiled. I noticed some of you guys complaining about the prices on SR for marijuana, but for me, they&#039;re actually around the same price, if not cheaper than what I normally get good bud for. <br /><br />Good Bud (East Coast)<br />G: $20<br />1/8: $60<br />1/4: $120<br />1/2: $160-180<br />O: $300-340<br /><br />Years ago, I remember paying over $400USD for an onion.

				Eh, I pay about 325-350 from my grower who does it all with organic soil, but there&#039;s a limited supply available.&nbsp; I have another guy who gets mids and dro that&#039;s way better than the organic soil stuff and he charges 325-350 a zone too, but it gets me that paranoid high so I usually stick with the organic stuff.&nbsp; The mids is amazing too, for 120 a zone.&nbsp; I usually sell the high grade shit to my friends and smoke on the mids if it isn&#039;t the organic stuff.&nbsp; Weed makes my anxiety go off like crazy if it&#039;s the high grade shit.

				East Coast US...<br /><br />For dank<br />1g - $20<br />Quarter - $90-$110<br />Half O - $160-$210<br />Ounce - $260-$350<br /><br />Pretty much like SR. The bud around here is really good, a bowl pack is usually enough for me, so I&#039;ve always wondered if ordering off of SR would be any better. It&#039;s the same prices, might as well just get it from someone I know. I&#039;ll definitely have to try out some bud from some vendors on SR though.

				where i live we pay around 25 to 30 euros for a gram of skunk,but to be fair its good weed most of it is dutch,the rest is Greek or homegrown who both are grown from dutch seeds.An ounce costs 460-560.That&#039;s because there&#039;s a much much higher demand on weed than other drugs which is good but still its fucked up COME ON PEOPLE SAY YES TO HEROIN WEED IS BAD IT&nbsp; MAKES YOU HUNGRY

				A lot of our weed comes from Michigan or is grown locally (I do not live in Michigan, but do live in the Midwest).&nbsp; I have 2 sources IRL.&nbsp; The guy selling indoor hydroponic weed is very consistent with pricing.&nbsp; The strains vary, but are always VERY good - my only beef is sometimes it is not properly dried, so it is underweight once it has finished curing.<br /><br />Skunky Indoor:<br />$100 for 7g<br />$200 for 14g<br />$375-400 for 28g<br /><br />For lack of a better description, I&#039;ll classify the second as high quality commercial - prices vary.&nbsp; It is outdoor grown (usually sativa) and not as fresh or tasty or smelly.&nbsp; Often it has a few seeds, some sticks and can be leafy.<br /><br />High quality commercial:<br />$50-100 for 7g<br />$100-150 for 14g<br />$200-300 for 28g<br /><br />

				Middle US<br /><br />Pretty much all i see is high quality pot from Colorado or something else that&#039;s not bad that was grown locally. You can find shitty seedy weed from black people for hella cheap if thats your thing..<br /><br />7g-100$<br /><br />Oz-300$-325$<br /><br />QP-1000$-1200$<br /><br /><br />Pisses me off cus i have a friend who moved to Colorado recently and got his medical card, he said oz&#039;s of top shelf are like 220$, mid shelf goes for like 180$<br /><br />And the mid shelf shit is the kinda stuff that sells for 50$ an eighth...<br />Also, that&#039;s what the dispensary is charging, if you were friends with the grower, or buddies with the close friend of the grower, you might be able to get it a little cheaper. <br /><br /><br /><br />Colorado is a beautiful state

				UK prices are disgusting compared to abroad. this is why vendors should ship to uk. theres massive resale value alone on the fact you can charge 10GPB for 0.8 grams if its high quality.

				UK prices where I am:<br /><br />Hash: £35 average 1/4 of pollen (need to burn)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; £50 decent quality 1/4 biscuit pollen (crumbles or grates quite nicely, no need to burn)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; £60 good squidgy 1/4 lebanese black (that you can roll into snakes for joints)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; £60/70 top quality 1/4 blonde pollen/double zero (blonde crumbles easily, double zero - bit rarer - fluffs up well on burning)<br /><br />Weed: varies depending on strain<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;£45 - £75 for a 1/4 - usually bone dry so you get your full weight - not a great choice locally, gotta take what&#039;s available, and not always on tap.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the dudes I get weed from just make up the names of the strains half the time.
