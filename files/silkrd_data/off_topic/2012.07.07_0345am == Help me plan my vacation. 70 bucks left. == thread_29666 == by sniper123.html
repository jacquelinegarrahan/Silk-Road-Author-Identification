				So i&#039;m leaving to go on vacation on Thursday. That&#039;s 7/ 13. I&#039;m trying to get some goodies for my vacation so that means i&#039;m going to do either priority or express shipping. (Only vendors that waive sig on express because signing spooks the hell out of me.) I already have something to smoke on. I was looking to either roll or trip. Suggestions. I&#039;m on the Us east coast. <br /><br />Requirements are the following:<br />It has to arrive on 7/12 or before. <br />You can only recommend a vendor that can provide express shipping (Sig waived) or priority.<br />You can only recommend vendors you have personally used. <br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions i would greatly appreciate it. Do you think tripping will be better than rolling or vice versa? I&#039;ll award karma accordingly. :)

				how about rolling AND tripping? does not have to be at the same time&nbsp; :)<br /><br />i would choose tripping for the daytime activities and rolling for the evening night<br />just choosing between them tripping (on lsd) has my vote, cos it&#039;s like 12 hours of fun + the nice afterglow

				USAShroomz is your guy. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/74b020ae43<br /><br />All it takes is 1/4 of a bar for an ungodly strong trip. I&#039;ve only had the Cubensis bars so I can&#039;t vouch for the Galindoi, but I&#039;m sure they are quality. He lists every Sunday night and has lightning fast shipping, it will reach you before the 13th easily.
