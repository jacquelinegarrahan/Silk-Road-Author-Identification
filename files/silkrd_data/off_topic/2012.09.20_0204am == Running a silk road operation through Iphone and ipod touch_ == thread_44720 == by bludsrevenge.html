				So I am in a place currently where if I get caught with my laptop very bad things will happen to me. I figure that it is easier to hide an ipod touch than a laptop. Does this plan work. I currently have a iphone 4s with personal hotspot with unlimited data. I can run mobile tor from cydia on my ipod touch ( I will get wifi from my iphone from mobile hotspot). I will change the port to 8118 and to 127.0.0.1 . Doing this could I run my seller account from the ipod touch. Will certain things not work from SR and other onion websites on my ipod? Like for example tormail or something. I feel like I&#039;m missing some step here. Please reply with suggestions to make this work better or tell me if this will work at all.

				You can use the onionbrowser ap that&#039;s available in the ap store. It seems to function pretty well.

				you must understand that you are using an apple product, which, by its nature, is very susceptible to :<br />1. centralized interference ( apple / government/telecom companies, etc)<br />2. various hacking attacks due to popularity of the devices<br />3. information tracking due to extensive integration with social networking.<br /><br />I would even not use jailbroken products, although i would trust them more than original apple products when it comes to my personal information.<br /><br />I do not know if all of that is really a concern, but i would not use apple products for anything illegal just because the above risks exists.<br />in fact i would use apple products to lead a normal life and blend in with the &quot;normal&quot; people, so that i can continue my &quot;questionable&quot; activities without arousing suspicion. <br /><br />When you are doing something illegal, you have to switch identities, and keep in mind that during that time, you are a different person.<br />Keep reminding yourself. Stay safe.<br />

				Amazon kindle fire? How could I run onion sites off of that. Also with mobile tor running my browser is the same as using tor on the computer. SR will be displayed on my ipod touch which has no location services and is disabled to do anything but use wifi. I dont have to worry about it sending reports to apple or something because it isnt an iphone its an ipod touch. The iphone is only being used as a personal hotspot. It definitely wont be collecting information. Also as another layer the iphone itself has all functions disabled(including location services)&nbsp; except for the verizon service so that it gets internet. Thanks for all your posts keep them coming

				Hi bro ive used my iphone 4 To Buy a few times when i was out and about on road to save time from getting back home to order up (I Sold That Phone few months Later) as its not ideal unless you get a cheaper phone to use tor and keep buying and selling em on ebay or something......but to use as a sellers account you might come across problems if you need to use pgp to encrypt/decrypt etc so i would stick with chucking the files on a usb stick and you could just use it where ever you find is stealth enough...(not the library). :)<br />

				Smart phones are as close as you can get to a direct line to the NSA. I will not believe any app on them is at all secure. That said please do it because I&#039;d like, for experimental purposes of course,&nbsp; to see how long it takes to conduct the investigation that busts you. lol <br /><br />Seriously friend, stick with what you can know is secure, with open source code. <br /><br />Regards

				Hey maybe you coulld put it in somebody elses name or it would be better if you got it from someone and never changed it over hahaha or if you could create a flashe drive with a bootable android os from liberte or something like that. You&#039;d probly have to use a usb extension but I couldn&#039;t say because I have never owned a smart phone or any good phone. I got 2 food stamp phones lol
