				You can&#039;t make a list without sharing the criteria used.<br /><br />If you look at what is used the most, and how socially acceptable they are, then the list would look like this.<br /><br />1. Caffeine (coffee, red bull)<br />2. Alcohol (beer, wine, whiskey, vodka)<br />3. Nicotine (tobacco)<br /><br />If you look at which narcotic you like the best (which is different for everybody), then you get a whole different list that might contain MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, etc.

				Yeah I&#039;m inclined to agree with CoolGrey here, although I doubt that&#039;s what OP had in mind. <br /><br />Using the definition that ANY mind-altering drug is a &quot;recreational drug&quot;, my personal list would be: <br /><br />1. Caffeine: it&#039;s in everything from coffee to Coke to tea (my personal favorite being yerba mat√©) and is perfect for daily use due to its benign nature. I love it more than any other drug and will be using it &#039;till the day I die. <br /><br />2. MDMA. If I could somehow use molly on a weekly basis, it would be 1# on my list hands down. Unfortunately, it can only really be safely done once a season, which makes it a &quot;special-occasion&quot;-type drug only. Regardless, I&#039;ve never felt better on a drug and it&#039;s definitely in my top five all-time life experiences.<br /><br />3. Alcohol. It often gets a very bad wrap from serious drug users due to its admittedly shitty &quot;high&quot;, but if used in moderation, it makes for a relaxing evening. I thoroughly enjoy a nice beer or wine to pare with my evening meal. Used for the purposes of getting black-out drunk or in a hard liquor like vodka though, and it would be close to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If we&#039;re talking illegal drugs only, my list would be as follows: <br /><br />1. MDMA (see above)<br /><br />2. LSD - not a huge fan of psychedelics, but acid opened up some doors in my mind that I never had access to before. I wouldn&#039;t call it a particuarly life-changing experience like many people would, but I&#039;m very glad I got to experience it for myself. <br /><br />3. Amphetamines (i.e. adderall) - Longer-lasting and cheaper than cocaine and much less neurotoxic than meth. It&#039;s my go-to &quot;get some shit done&quot; workhorse.

				In terms of all factors combined for &#039;illicit&#039; drugs:<br />MDMA<br />LSD<br />Cannabis<br /><br />For me:<br />MDMA<br />2c-b<br />Cocaine<br />(I&#039;m still yet to try LSD, I feel this would probably be on this list instead of cocaine if I had already tried it.)<br />

				1) LSD&nbsp; ---&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally not a fan, but any drug capable of starting a full-blown cultural revolution gets my stamp of approval.<br /><br />2) Alcohol --- Might be an unnecessary and problematic now, but actually saved millions of lived by sanitizing water and providing nutrition throughout history. In fact, the workers that build the pyramids were paid in beer. Alcohol literally build the Great Pyramids of Giza. Watch the &quot;How Beer Saved the World&quot; documentary sometime.<br /><br />3) Cannabis --- Another drug I, personally, am not a fan of. However, after the recent events in Colorado and Washington, it&#039;s proving to be the drug that will hopefully end the war on drugs.

				Is there some sort of line between/difference in discovered or invented? <br /><br />I feel like that difference could be relevant. Especially considering how many people say &quot;weed&#039;s natural, drugs are man made&quot; <br />Where exactly do you draw that line? Marinol? Mescaline? DMT? Meth is only a few steps away from being ephedra, and opium doesn&#039;t even need to be processed. Hell, even naturally occurring DXM and Vynase has been reported.

				In terms for the best for the money when it comes to the subject of the ratio of euphoria to health risk then My vote would be for marijuana. Figuring out the first place drug in any and every category in my opinion would have to be marijuana. The only drawbacks of it are of the legal natures which are slowly changing and become null hopefully sooner then later. <br /><br />I should add that this short list is a matter of my opinion and may be biased according to what I like. Number 2 for me is stimulants. <br />Number 3 would have to be pain pills.<br /><br />sidenote: I don&#039;t have a regular Dr. or nor do i have insurance at this time<br /><br />Number 4 would have to be Silk Road. I am incredibly addicted to Silk Road. Any opinions?
