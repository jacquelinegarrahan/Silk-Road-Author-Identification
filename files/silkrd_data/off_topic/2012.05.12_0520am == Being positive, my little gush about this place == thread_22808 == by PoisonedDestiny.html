				it&#039;s not all sunshine and roses, but this place has treated me well.<br /><br />How many here have had SR change their life for the better?&nbsp; i just felt my experienced my first buyer-side scam, but it was minor (for me) and massive in scale so i don&#039;t feel alone.&nbsp; but with 16 prior wonderful transactions i want to say some things about this place.&nbsp; <br />also tho.. how many have become dependent on SR for their recreational needs?<br />these are the nice things using SR almost exclusively have done for me..<br /><br />1.&nbsp; regulates my drug use.&nbsp; i always hated the &quot;impulse buy&quot;.&nbsp; but when one has inconsistent connections and rotating stock, i tend to blow tons of money to &quot;stock up&quot; on something that i may not see again for years.&nbsp; the quality ends up sucking.&nbsp; <br />i have not recieved a single item from SR that sucked.&nbsp; a vast majority blow away anything i have ever tried.&nbsp; <br />with my slow BTC process and shipping, SR allows me to plan, while simultaneously allowing me to order that substance that i crave.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; rotates my drug use.&nbsp; i have picked up habits in the past, but with SR i rotate hard drugs, moving between stims, opiates, and others in long sluggish curves, stretched over months.&nbsp; <br /><br />3.&nbsp; saves me money (surprisingly!!!):&nbsp; while the prices are premium, i&#039;ve found great deals with intensive scouring and the quality allows me to use less, and save more.&nbsp; i have had consistent supplies of fun stuff since coming here.&nbsp; <br /><br />4.&nbsp; protects lil me.&nbsp; no more face to face, severely disadvantaged or relying on a male friend that may gank my stuff.&nbsp; here being female gives me no perks, up or down.&nbsp; i like just being a person, and i like the physical safety.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; however, lost most of my RL dealers.&nbsp; while i consider this a good thing.&nbsp; most were shady fucks.&nbsp; i hated having to maintain relationships with people i hate.&nbsp; but if SR dies, i may be stranded.&nbsp; i do have emergency plans in place..&nbsp; i hope everyone else does too!!<br /><br />*destiny*

				SR has changed my life for the better as well. I love the fact that I no longer have to deal with shady dealers and constant fear of being pulled over and arrested after I make a deal. This shit happens a lot where I live. In fact I get harassed even when im not buying drugs, but thats another story....<br /><br />Ive only had one deal that was a semi scam that I wont elaborate on, because I did receive something, although it wasnt what i ordered. It was a small price to pay, and i wont ever do business with that vendor again so lesson learned. <br /><br />The prices here are about what I pay on the street, except for weed which I get for free. Im still considering trying some of the high quality edibles that are posted, but its hard to justify spending my hard earned btc on MJ when i can smoke all day and night for free&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I can only hope this place is here forever. If god forbid it were to disappear, Id be really upset, but where theres a will, theres a way, you know what i mean&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have said it before and I will say it again..I have taken giant strides toward self actualization through the use of various hallucinogens obtained on SR. If SR were to disappear I would be devastated but would take solace in the fact that I was able to be a part of something bigger than myself and all of us.

				Yeah man I agree with you.<br /><br />But I mean the sort of girl that is hot.. cool.. and into drugs. I know maybe 1? And she only does coke/mdma etc every now and then.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never met a girl with the party at all times no matter the cost mindset that wasn&#039;t fucked up in some major way. <br /><br />It&#039;s a shame because I know they&#039;re out there..

				Destiny, you&#039;re so absolutely right about that. My girlfriend is pretty darn hot, not necessarily the smartest, but by all means not stupid either.<br /><br />I had used most types of drugs (except needles) when I met her, and she had only once tried a MJ but didn&#039;t like it. After being together for a year or so, she moved in with me and got confronted with my habit of puffing some in the weekends. At some point she wanted to try it too, and guess what, she liked it because this time she felt much more comfortable. From there on she pretty much followed me in trying different things and trusts me for making the right decisions (and I do make sure nothing gets out of hand). Before I knew, I got her in to many things that neither of us would have expected her to get in to.<br /><br />I would say trust in someone&#039;s judgement makes a huge difference. Given that I&#039;m doing quite good on pretty much anything in life, she figured that these drugs didn&#039;t have to ruin you as long as you use them responsibly. It&#039;s the irresponsible/dumb/depressed people who end up getting fucked over by drugs. You need to get people to understand that. Just be responsible and aware of what you can or cannot handle.<br /><br />Anyway, back on-topic, I second the guy who said this is the best discovery since masturbation. And Destiny, I also agree with your original post. This being anonymous, every subject can be discussed. It&#039;s nothing like real life; you can share experiences and thoughts with like-minded people from all over the world, nothing like would be possible anywhere else. I have only been here a couple days so far and I totally love this place already. Aside from that, I finally have a chance to sell my product much more safely and start building a reputation in a way I never think I could on the streets.<br /><br />Peace!<br /><br />

				I may not post all that often, but I&#039;ve been workin on lurkin for a long ass time and I just have to say this thread is much appreciated. There&#039;s been so much melodrama, trolling, and other poisonous shit on here lately. Some good vibes were much needed. Thanks, PD. :)<br /><br />Also, I second your list of awesome SR perks.

				A place to chat with like minded individuals has been wonderfully relieving to my mind.
