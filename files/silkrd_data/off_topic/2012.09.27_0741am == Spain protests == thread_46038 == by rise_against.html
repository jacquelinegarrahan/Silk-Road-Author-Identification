				anyone here from spain? the protests look pretty Brutal.&nbsp; so many arrests, but from the pictures it looks like the protesters have the cops outnumbered 1000:1 and could crush them easy.&nbsp; not sure what the laws are over there on peaceful assembly, here in the states a bunch of UC Davis students that were pepper sprayed by policia sued and were each rewarded $30,000.&nbsp; America needs a good revolution, and it could be coming very soon.

				Its great too see, the solidarity in Spain is very encouraging, fair play to them. Here in Europe the battle lines have been drawn years ago between the working class and the higher classes and their state thug pigs who defend them and beat us off OUR own streets.<br />Capitalism and the rich&#039;s parasitic &quot;norm&quot; that has strangled our society is and will come to an end, all we need is something major as a catalyst to wake up the millions of lumpen that are too bothered watching fucking x factor and getting fat and stupid.<br /><br />America will have a far right wing revolution if any, the lack of political understanding is shameful there, even within the &quot;occupation movement&quot; it was a big bag full of air and resulted in nothing because it had no agenda or politics, you have two parties, one is a far right wing party the other is just right wing ha ha? Some clowns even think Obama is a socialist for christ sake, Hes center right wing! <br /><br />Off yer knees! Viva los trabajadores!

Viva los trabajadores!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The Occupy Movement did have an agenda: to raise awareness of the wide-spread corruption and misuse of power by both corporations and our politicians. It didn&#039;t have any real impact because the corporate-controlled media - who make their beds with our politicians - did EVERYTHING in their power to discredit it and to cover only enough to make it seem like it was nothing more than a bunch of beatniks in a drum circle. It was far, far from that, but too many people are too trusting of the establishment and far too many people believe everything they hear reported by the big news corporations.<br /><br />Mark my words: it will happen again. It will happen soon. The next time it happens, it won&#039;t be so peaceful. The US can only repeat Roman history for so long before going tits up the way the Romans did.<br /><br />And don&#039;t tell me for a second you think the problem of being uninformed - or just being stupid enough to believe your country&#039;s politicians - is centralized only to the USA. It&#039;s a world-wide crisis.

				I followed the news, it&#039;s intense stuff. The prospects for the Spanish youth are deplorable, so I can completely understand that they&#039;re angry.
