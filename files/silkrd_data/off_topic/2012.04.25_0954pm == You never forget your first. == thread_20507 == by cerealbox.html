				What was the first time you got fucked up like? For me, I was about 7. I had some sort of dental surgery (I don&#039;t remember what kind) and they gave me nitrous. Only they didn&#039;t tell me what it was for or what it&#039;d do. So as I started getting sleepy I summoned every once I had to not fall asleep and embarrass myself - imagine, for instance, having to take a shit really bad and not wanting to shit your pants in public. I summoned that kind of will power. So, amazed that I was still awake after several minutes of this, they turned it up. And up. And up. Until it wouldn&#039;t go any more. And then I lost consciousness in the most glorious way ever. This was also, by the way, my first erection (I understand this is an unusual reaction to nitrous). IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME. I had no idea what was going on or if it was ever going to end, but I fucking loved it. I ask for nitrous every single time I go to the dentist. None of them have agreed to give me some, even with some seriously painful procedures, but fucking nitrous. That made me want to do drugs once I understood what they were.

				I was 17 the first time I smoked weed. A couple college friends of mine were hanging out watching a movie, someone rolled a blunt, and the rest is history..

				I was 13 when I started smoking weed by my own curiousness to try new things. (I LOVED it so I kept doing it).<br />At 15, I dabbled in Shrooms occasionally and rarely X or LSD.<br />Until I graduated college I did just that, but after college I knew more people and they got me stuff so I said &quot;Oh, what the hell, I&#039;ll try it,&quot;<br />So here I am...

				Nitrous at the dentist. He talked like Goofy and always hooked you up. (Instead of turning it off and turning on the oxygen like most dentist)<br /><br />Went to a 3d gold room where I was shown floating gold objects. Also had plenty of OBE&#039;s in that office :D<br />No wonder I love drugs so much, I was introduced at such an early age!

				Was 12 when I first smoked weed on vacation at my cousins, they stole it from my aunt so I figured it should couldn&#039;t be that big of a deal. Started drinking around 16. Started smoking on my own around 17 even though none of my friends did I had just always had an interest in it and liked the culture. Did just about everything else within my first year of college, crazy fucking stupid year. Got my shit together and decided weed is the main thing for me with the others to be taken for celebrations or whatever.

				First smoked weed when I was 14, I was pretty sheltered up until that point so it was a huge deal to me, I was really nervous and felt like kind of a badass. I was really naive back then and thought weed was something that was difficult to find and everyone who claimed to do it was lying to sound cool. Imagine my surprise in 10th grade when I found out its as easy to get as a bottle of soda :P <br /><br />Smoked weed erry&#039;day for a few months, eventually tried E and shrooms soon after, which are now my DOC. Started dabbling in the world of DMT recently as well, mind blowing stuff but it kind of scares me.
