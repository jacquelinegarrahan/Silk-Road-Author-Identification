				So i&#039;ve ordered some green from 2 different vendors. I sent them a message before hand letting them know &quot; hey im gonna be making a purchase &quot; <br /><br />And once the purhcase was made, i sent them another message saying &quot; Okay, i&#039;ve purchased, when can i expect them to ship out, and how good is the strain i&#039;ve ordered. &quot; Typical stuff like that.<br /><br />One vendor, its been 3 days and no reply, and no change in the order, still stuck at processing.<br />The 2nd vendor, it&#039;s been 2 days, and still no reply or change in my order.<br /><br />I understand that it&#039;s the weekend, but i mean, i feel its a little rude that a vendor wont respond to my generic questions about when its gonna ship, and how good it is. <br /><br />

Did you use PGP when you contacted them? If you didn&#039;t, then that might be a reason why they have not contacted you back. A lot of vendors are strict on their communication and if someone does not use PGP they will simply discard your message.<br /><br />A lot of vendors get swamped with orders, and they simply do not have time to answer your questions. Some vendors on here are strictly business and do not have time for small talk. You have to realize it might take multiple days before your package is put into transit if the vendor is busy. Perhaps they have fallen behind on orders and will get yours out as soon as they can.<br /><br />Good luck with your orders!<br /><br />

				Vendors don&#039;t need to be told that you&#039;ve ordered, they can see that.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be shipped when it&#039;s shipped, most vendors will have time estimates on their pages. <br /><br />Most vendors don&#039;t work on the weekend, why should they?<br /><br />Why would you ask how good the product is after you&#039;ve ordered it? This is what the reviews are for.<br /><br />Unnecessary questions that don&#039;t warrant responses imo. <br /><br />HTH :)

				Yea, you guys make good points.<br /><br />They do have PGP keys but from the feedback thats been left with them, alot of the consensus is that they&#039;re quick to respond to messages, and their pages even say send them a message if you have questions etc etc.<br /><br />And Tiger, i didnt even think about checking out the reviews, but now that you mentioned it im gonna take a look, cause to be honest, what i purchased looks good and it sounds amazing, i was just trying to figure out wether they are indica, or sativa.<br /><br />I suffer from severe insomnia ( not due to drugs ) and so im just making sure the weed i&#039;m buying will definitely help with me sleeping ya know?<br /><br />Thank you all for you input and suggestions, its been greatly appreciated.

				What strain did you order? <br /><br />Have you seen the new weed sub categories? There&#039;s indica and sativa dominant categories now.<br /><br />I&#039;d be checking the reviews on the item page (and the other weight variants), searching on these here forums and maybe searching on the reddit site to see if there&#039;s any more information.<br /><br />Some vendors will be more friendly than others but I&#039;d hold off messaging them unless I really had to.

				Well every vendor i have ever dealt with on this website has been very chatty, they always answer any Q&#039;s i may have and so its just weird to me that 2 don&#039;t ( which is completely understandable if they dont wanna chit chat or answer any silly questions that arent important ) <br /><br />As for the strains, i Ordered 2 strains, White fire Larry OG and Border bud. ( i know what to expect with the border bud, but it was dirt cheap, and im on a budget lol ) But the fire larry has me intrigued. <br />&nbsp;and reading about them just makes me want this orders to be pushed into TRANSIT even faster now. @.@ i&#039;ve got several health issues, and the state i live in doesnt provide Medical Marijuana to people with my health problems.<br />Normally i&#039;d just be going to some street dealer, but seeing as how i never leave my home, and have severe social anxiety its hard to meet people lol.

				Fair enough, just my view on the situation-could be way off the mark!<br /><br />I still wouldn&#039;t be expecting a reply on the weekend though.<br /><br />Hope the Larry does the trick.

				Well after reading the vendors review thread, im not the only one who this has happened to.<br />He doesnt respond to a majority of messages, and if he does at all, it&#039;s days and days after the initial message is sent.<br /><br />I know he&#039;s been on, cause his vendor page says last seen today.<br /><br />Either way, im canceling my order with this vendor. <br />I&#039;ve sent him a message to cancel the order, if he has shipped it already, then i will of course finalize when it arrives, but at this point id rather buy a couple grams and pay a good vendor who ships quickly.<br /><br />And i understand, vendors don&#039;t have time to bother with simple messages like mine, but i mean, at least give me a heads up why everything is taking so damn long, all i want is a little common courtesy...<br /><br />UPDATE: <br />So i re-checked my orders, and both are now in transit. :/ So i guess now im stuck with this order.<br />Oh well lol...<br />@.@ guess i cant complain too much lol....<br /><br />Thanks everyone for your input on the situation. <br /><br />now we play the waiting game...

				You also want to thoroughly read their vendor pages. A lot of them are very detailed and vendors get irritated when you ask stuff that&#039;s on their vendor page. Believe me, I irritate them all the time. Many tell you specifically that orders could take up to x amount of days to go out. They all don&#039;t go out the same or the next day.

				I always read their vendor pages, read every page of feedback, and sometimes i&#039;ll read the actual forum reviews. And both vendors state &quot; have a question? Send us a message &quot;<br /><br />wellll i had questions...sent them a message...no response from 1 of them lol.<br /><br />But it&#039;s all good now.

				Have they read the message yet?<br />If the word &quot;unread&quot; is bold in the message (instead of the word &quot;read&quot;, that means it is still unread.<br /><br />It has been the weekend and you have to remember that we have lives too. We like going away on the weekend or getting out, which means we can&#039;t check Silk Road constantly.<br />I usually check messages at least 2-3 times per day, but if I&#039;m out I cannot check anything.<br /><br />Also, we get a lot of messages and it isn&#039;t necessary to let us know you&#039;ve placed an order. We can see the order details easily enough.<br /><br />I hope you get your order arriving soon anyway. Enjoy what Silk Road has to offer!

				I always do enjoy what i order, that was never the issue.<br /><br />Like i mentioned in my previous posts, im just use to a certain kind of friendly banter between myself and the vendor while my order is still being processed or waiting to be delivered.<br /><br />Either way, the vendor has marked the package as in transit, so now we play the waiting game. <br /><br />And i do believe he has not read any of my messages, because if you go to &quot; messages &gt; sent &quot; all his messages are still in bold black, while the rest of the other messages to other people and vendors are not bold.

				There&#039;s no reason to message them saying you will purchase and that you have purchased. As for the processing it is marked in transit when it is shipped and mail doesn&#039;t get sent out on the weekend so its moot to mail it then, only sits in packaging letting the smell seep out.
