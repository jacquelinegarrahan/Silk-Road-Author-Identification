				Hey!<br /><br />This may be an interest to anyone with some stash of Litecoins . New hidden market, just like SR but accepting LTC instead of BTC, has just been opened. You can find it here: atlantisrky4es5q.onion <br /><br />Given the current situation &amp; shifts on digital crypto-currency mining scene, combined with lessons learnt from BTC exchange rates - this may be a great thing!<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts on this...

				I can&#039;t find an exchange anywhere?<br />Google it and you&#039;ll see there are only proof of concept stages and a few sketchy exchanges. . .&nbsp; <br />Theoretically, it would be easy for anyone to watch this one or two exchanges closely and track stuff.. dunno. . .<br /><br />One thing, is the site asks for your country.&nbsp; Then, it shows only items from your country sort of thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />It seems hard to cash out. . if its even possible in some countries. .. cool idea, but finding someone willing to exchange is tough at this stage. . ..&nbsp; its like collecting hockey cards and not being able to find anyone willing to pay x amount for a card that you paid xxx for.<br /><br />Nice site.&nbsp; Seems like they are finally coming up with competing sites.&nbsp; They seem like they are litecoin because they are related to it somehow.&nbsp; Like the site was made just to promote litecoins .&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder how vendors cash out without using a bank?&nbsp; Fly to denmark and walk into a litecoin shop?

				The litecoin community is so small that you can mine coins with a desktop GPU. That&#039;s the best way to get them, and they are rewarded every 2.5 minutes instead of 10. There&#039;s nothing more anon than coins with no transaction history, provided you&#039;re running your litecoin-qt over Tor.<br />
