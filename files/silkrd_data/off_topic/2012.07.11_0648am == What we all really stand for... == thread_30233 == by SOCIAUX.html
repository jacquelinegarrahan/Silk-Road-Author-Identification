				For those of you who aren&#039;t aware, the community has recently lost a great man. One of the greatest. If you want to read more about it, and stay informed: dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7913.0<br /><br />This was a huge reality check for me, as I&#039;m sure it was for other people. I just can&#039;t seem to stop thinking about it.<br /><br />SR isn&#039;t just about an easy and safe way to get quality psychoactive drugs. It&#039;s so much more than that. It&#039;s a living, breathing community; one with more life and passion than I&#039;ve ever seen.<br />In a world filled with propaganda and misinformation, we strive to spread accurate information. We want to help people and make their lives better, not hurt them. <br />I actually shed a tear when I was reading about Ene being incarcerated. It completely blows my mind that someone as good as him could end up with a possible life sentence... I just can&#039;t put my feelings into words right now...<br /><br />We&#039;re fighting a war here, and SR is on the forefront of advocating personal freedom and the spread of accurate knowledge and clean, safe drugs. We&#039;re fighting the good fight.<br /><br />Here&#039;s SR Admin&#039;s response to the Feds threatening to shut us down:<br /><br />&quot;The die have been cast and now we will see how they land. We will be diverting even more effort into countering their attacks and making the site as resilient as possible, which means we may not be as responsive to messages for a while. I&#039;m sure this news will scare some off, but should we win the fight, a new era will be born. Even if we lose, the genie is out of the bottle and they are fighting a losing War already.&quot;<br /><br />I can&#039;t escape the feeling that we (as a community) are on the cusp of something HUGE. It&#039;s a little tingle in the back of my head.<br />With the singularity approaching (Dec. 21, 2012) and the major spiritual shift that is predicted to precede that, I can&#039;t help but think that this has something to do with the way the people of the world view knowledge and psychoactive substances. I can only hope.<br />Big things are happening, people. Big things.<br /><br />Regardless, we are fighting a war. And I know which side I&#039;m on.<br />Keep fighting the good fight, guys.<br /><br />PEACE<br />--SOCIAUX
