				I&#039;ve been told to go to health stores, but I was wondering if there were any chain stores that carry them such as Rite-Aid, CVS,Wal-Mart, etc. Or, if the GNC or other stores have any caps that you can empty out and re-fill with mdma. The bottles aren&#039;t transparent so I can&#039;t tell what type of caps they have- I have some temazepam caps I was going to throw out that I can re-use, but they seem a little small.

				I go to GNC and look for the blue clear bottle and get the cheapest one with the biggest caps. Last time I bought some type of fertility supplement but ti was like 8 - 10 dollars and were huge caps. If you have time order those ones that are empty if not 10 bucks GNC and your good.

				i got mine off ebay across the pond. just empty ones and they have a variety of sizes. best way for shrooms. until they get stuck on your tonsils and you got to choke it back out.. still preferable to that taste.

				as people said you can get em online or in a store. 00 sized ones (kinda big) are the easiest to find. they&#039;re really only good for things that are taken by the gram. anything in the milligram range i&#039;d recommend smaller size 4 or size 5 pills. amazon definitely has size 4 pills and many health stores may have size 3 pills (bigger number is smaller pill size)<br /><br />so yeah, if you just want empty gel caps and don&#039;t care about size, amazon. if you need something specific look for a vitamin or health food store

				GNC <br /><br />100 empty gel capsules for ~4 dollars.<br />Dont waste money or time by buying them with a supplement already in them. GNC will gladly sell you empty ones<br /><br />And none of your customers are going to care what size your empty gel capsules are

				there&#039;s a ridiculous variety. caps or just normal pills but then you can taste the nastiness. soluble has to be the worst though. i prefer ibuprofen it&#039;s always sugar coated or liquid gel. goes down easier plus anti inflammatory goodness. yes this is the off topic section :)

				They&#039;re really cheap on eBay, don&#039;t go too small though. Size 0 or 1 are good for MDMA.
