				Orders under $10 no longer affect rank at all.<br /><br />I would list up a sample worth $30 for $10 and say that only buyers with over 10 transactions and 100 posts in the forums are eligible.&nbsp; That&#039;s what I did when I first got on here (oh, so long ago :)&nbsp; ), and I think I did 10 samples in a matter of hours.&nbsp; Got the ball rolling for sure!

				Moon Bear, one thing i gotta say... You make me laugh.....One word of advice. you should probably stop buying or selling drugs for a while. At least until you get some more knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp;Im not knocking you, im trying to help you. <br /><br />Next time you post something, let an adult read your post before posting.. Maybe your Mom or Dad may help.. Im not trying to be condescending. Dont you want people to laugh with you instead of at you? <br /><br />Maybe its all part of your game plan and you know this already. But I find your posts HILARIOUS!!!!

				I&#039;m also not fully aware of the happenings surrounding you moonbear but have seen your name pop up in threads a lot and can only assume that it&#039;s for bad things since people aren&#039;t saying particularly nice things about you.<br /><br />I won&#039;t message anyone on your behalf but I can give you the benefit of my consumer point of view.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly new around here, and have only made a couple of purchases, therefore I don&#039;t have the luxury of sticking only to vendors I know. On reading your posts in this thread I asked myself &#039;would I ever buy from him&#039; - the answer, probably not. Some ideas that could potentially change my mind (assuming you sell things I want):<br /><br />&nbsp;- post a link to the discussion regarding your problem transaction in your profile...I&#039;m a rational human being, as are most people here, and if I can see for myself that you&#039;ve been shafted and you really weren&#039;t at fault then I&#039;d consider buying from you if you were selling what I wanted at a good price. This only works though if what went down with this person is the sole reason for your bad rep, if it&#039;s a slew of different bad interactions I&#039;d probably think it was you and move on.<br /><br />- That brings me to point 2...entice people with slightly reduced prices. I know this isn&#039;t ideal, especially not for other vendors, but it could be a way to illustrate you&#039;re serious about building up a respectable business.<br /><br />- Other things I appreciate in a buyer - a well structured, proof-read, and informative profile and item listings. - This may just be me, maybe I&#039;m a grammar Nazi, I don&#039;t know but it just makes me feel more comfortable.<br /><br />- Again probably just me, but having a rapist as your picture is also not endearing. Not a deal breaker, but not as nice as some of the cool graphics that fly around here :)<br /><br />All of this was said with the best of intentions but knowing very little about you, your products, and your situation.

				Moonbear if you want to make money to repay your debts I would recommend that you buy 25i-nbome,doc,doi or whatever and make your own blotters and sell them on the street for 10 Dollars a hit.<br /><br />Or so I would say if I hadn&#039;t read some of your posts.I suggest you go ask neighbors paying for cutting their garden or sth and wait altleast annother 3 years before thinking again about selling drugs.

				after all this, your rep as a seller is going to drop immensely. go take a business course. there you will learn that when a product (inferior or not) is attached to a bad name, you change the name. I don&#039;t think many people will be buying from moonbear anytime soon. therefore, I suggest that you start over and change up - starting with your name. detach yourself from &quot;moonbear&quot;. get an extension from badboy, change your name, then start selling again. no one has to know. and next time, only sell quantity to trusted buyers. so you don&#039;t get fucked over again.

I don&#039;t think many people will be buying from moonbear anytime soon. therefore, I suggest that you start over and change up - starting with your name. detach yourself from &quot;moonbear&quot;. get an extension from badboy, change your name, then start selling again. no one has to know. and next time, only sell quantity to trusted buyers. so you don&#039;t get fucked over again.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The funny thing about the name problem, is thats what got him into this mess to begin with. He didnt have 150 dollars to get his sellers account in the first place. So, he&#039;d need another 150 to get a new one, and i&#039;m sure thats at least two months in allowance for him. <br />and if no one will even buy from him. I dont think anyone&#039;s going to give him another loan. <br /><br />moon bear. You tried. You failed. EVERYONE here is trying to give you good advise by telling you to stop with all this shit. Get a real job. pay back your debt that way.<br /><br />However, the more and more this goes on, i cant help but think moon bear is just trolling. Theres no way someone could fuck up this much, and have no idea why.<br />

				All that those cliches about the village idiot, shit if they weren&#039;t true. Someone else said laid it down with true eloquence it in the thread they dedicated to you: &quot;moonbear needs to smarten up&quot;. I do enjoy this tragicomedy but it makes me cringe to think that your legal guardians will almost certainly have to deal with the brunt of the trainwreck that is your attempt to peddle kiddie crack on the d33pwebz. Yeah, for anyone who doesn&#039;t know, moonbear is like 16, and there&#039;s no way the avatar is his picture because I guarantee he can&#039;t serve up facial hair like that -- in spite of how fitting that picture does seem, I must admit. <br /><br />You&#039;re so compromised at this point, you should probably just turn yourself in before they build an ever bigger case against you. Just default on your obligations and gtfo, the amounts of money you&#039;re all worked up about are utterly miniscule compared to the consequences that await your continued involvement in the biz. If someone was dumb enough to front you a sellers acct they deserve to learn a lesson in foolish capital allocation. Not to mention they should have held the withdrawal PIN until you had enough in there to pay it off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fail this strong = double facepalm

				I hate to sound like a cold hearted prick but the alarm bells were ringing for badboy..<br />He had as much warning as we all did that this was going to end badly. <br /><br />Are you trying to get the community to help pay for both of your fuck ups?<br /><br />My 2c. You cant sell on SR. There is more than likely just as many haters as those you make laugh. I told you people will just trash your feedback even if your service was A++..

				badboy is a businessman and he knew it was a high risk investment, which is why the interest rate was so high.&nbsp; but i still think it is admirable that moonbear is atleast trying to make his debt right,&nbsp; the majority of fucks around here,&nbsp; people like doublemint etc, would have just run off with badboys money.

				come on now mate. I dont think you can blame one buyer on your terrible reputation. Take the heat for it and just look to sort yourself out.<br /><br />Maybe if you asked SR if theyd let you sell the account (and change the name) and you could sell it for a reduced price?<br /><br />Even if he did change it to 5/5, from the looks of it everyone else has provided poor feedback too.<br /><br />sell your account, cover the rest with your pocketmoney and then dont consider selling again. <br /><br />Dont sell on here, you havnt got the skills, resources or respect too. Thats not an insult, just saying... But also, dont consider selling on the street either. From the sounds of it, you&#039;ll get your ass robbed or arrested in seconds. And people out there wont be having a laugh with an otherwise positive meaning. They will kick your ass, kidnap you or worse. Let alone getting set up by police or worse; having to deal with other dealers. from your posts if really seems you dont have the street smarts. you&#039;l get eaten up. <br /><br />its good you want to repay badboy, people will have a lot of time for that. Just do it right and then stick to personal use from another nym.
