				Ooright, I&#039;m pretty much a &#039;meat and potatoes&#039; guy.&nbsp; Mostly these days I stick to Molly, and on odd occasions I turbo boost it with 2CB. I haven&#039;t tried a heap of stuff, but recently I&#039;ve been eying off DMT as a potential new experiment. The short duration is definitely on the plus side as I&#039;m &#039;time poor&#039;&nbsp; :)<br /><br />So, what have you recently tried that you liked, or what is next on your list?

				DMT is on my short list as well. Been reading a lot of the experiences on Erowid and it&#039;s gotten me excited to try it out. I&#039;ve got no time for the long-term stuff either. I can&#039;t be the shitty dad saying, &quot;well I hope this shit wears off before I go pick my kid up at daycare.&quot;

				Yeah that seems to be the best option according to the &quot;experts&quot;<br /><br />Now the trick is just finding the time to do it. There&#039;s a documentary on Netflix called DMT: The Spirit Molecule, that I&#039;ve been wanting to watch.

				&quot;DMT The Spirit Molecule&quot; is really good. Have you watched the documentary on Shulgin?&nbsp; That&#039;s good, too.<br /><br />Looks like DMT is now top of my list!<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe I&#039;m looking at doing psychs again....

				You should try 25i-NBOMe.<br /><br />Keep in mind it&#039;s a research chemical with an awful safety profile and was first publically available in 2010 but if you&#039;re feeling experimental it&#039;s cheap as fuck ($0.44-$1/tab) and it&#039;s a great trip. It has great visuals for most people and it has a clear mindedness to it that most psychedelics don&#039;t have. To be honest you could take it and go to school/work without incident unless your job includes anything physical.<br /><br />Many describe it as &quot;clearminded and more euphoric LSD&quot;, it&#039;s great for a party. Not introspecive in the slightest for me.

				How do you get on with other hallucinogens? <br /><br />My advice would be to treat DMT with a lot of respect, it can be a wild ride but some people I know who have used it have found it a catalyst for a profound and an incredible journey.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Classic - The burden of the 21st century, too much hustle/ bustle and not enough time to trip.

And I love it for its briefness (Apparently the chemical compound is naturally broken down very quickly within our brains synapses) So you go very hard, then you pop back up - or back out of the toilet cubicle and back into the office.

				DMT is just... well it is strange.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants to leave their body and experience another universe.<br /><br />The short duration and safety of the drugs is a huge plus and the trip leaves you slack jawed and amazed each time. I never see the same thing twice.<br /><br />You should have someone watch you while you do it so that you don&#039;t burn yourself with the pipe though.

Then by an hour after dosing up to two hours after dosing you&#039;ll be peaking for 2-4 hours. Typically closer to four hours for the peak but all bodies are different. Then it is followed by a 2 hour comedown which is pretty peaceful, not really bad unless you wear yourself out by having an orgasm or mixing it with other drugs (not recommended).<br /><br />In total it&#039;s about an 8 hour trip.

				I&#039;m fine on psycs.&nbsp; Been doing them for 20 years, basically, and my first forays into the rave scene was with acid.&nbsp; I like acid but by the time it&#039;s run it&#039;s course I&#039;m always pretty much over it and just wanting to get off the fucking bus. It&#039;s fine when you&#039;re fully immersed with a bunch of people who are also fully immersed, but these days it&#039;s more frequent that I&#039;m doing goodies for my own edification or for &#039;spare time fun&#039;, so I really can&#039;t be fucked up for 8+ hours unless I magically have a free evening and that&#039;s reasonably rare.

				i know its not a psychedelic really but mxe was something I tried when I was feeling a bit experimental.&nbsp; Pretty crazy stuff I got a half gram off some vendor and managed to get the last of their stuff.&nbsp; After trying out increasing doses I decided i wanted to &quot;hole&quot;&nbsp; so I sniffed about 40-50 mg and then immediately put another 40-50 in my lower front gums.&nbsp; The things i saw I can only begin to describe.&nbsp; It started with this really intense falling sensation almost as if being thrown from a spaceship and into a wormhole (which is how i describe it now &quot;the wormhole&quot;) and from there it is what i would imagine a wormhole looking like.&nbsp; A lot of blue and white electricity looking shit spinning and pulsing around me with the falling sensation just getting faster.&nbsp; From there the memory is a bit faded (this was a year and a half ago too) but i remember being on some sort of different world or small moon or something completely crazy.&nbsp; But it was comfortable and peaceful there was long grass all around me but it was shimmering black and gold. and i remember seeing the sky as a blue-green color, but then i was just shooting through the wormhole again.&nbsp; One of the last things i remember seeing before i started to come back down was looking at myself laying in my bed (not sure how its possible but it happened) i was on my ceiling looking at myself laying on my bed, but it was backwards too as though i were laying on my ceiling head to foot with myself below me.<br /><br />I have tried to reach this kind of hole again but ended up getting some of the yellow sandy mxe (someone should know what im talking about) which was a bit weaker and more stimmy than the mxe i got the first time which was pure white and fluffy. <br /><br />all in all i may go get some coins now that im back to thinking about it and take another go at it;)<br /><br />good luck with the experimenting and happy exploring!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />thought i should add that low dose mxe really only lasts 4-6 hrs

				If you haven&#039;t tried it already I would like to recommend MDA. It can get fairly psychedelic but in a fairly gentle way, combined with the happy glow of MDMA and quite a bit more energy in my experience.
