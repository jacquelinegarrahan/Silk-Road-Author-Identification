				depends largely on the vendor and their situation.&nbsp; Some are A LOT slower than others, I&#039;m talking over a month. You just need to decide if you want to wait or go with another vendor.

				vendors, if you can&#039;t get your package out in the 4 days before the cancel button appears, you shouldn&#039;t be selling - and you should delist and stop wasting peoples time.<br /><br />imo, as soon as the cancel button is available it&#039;s been too long. if i haven&#039;t heard from the vendor as to why the order is delayed i&#039;ll cancel and move on. i&#039;ve only had to do this once.

				It&#039;s your right to cancel at your discretion as soon as the 4-day period is up.&nbsp; If you haven&#039;t heard anything from the seller and have tried at least 1 PM attempt (I recommend this for the sake of cordiality, since you never know what&#039;s going on in someone&#039;s f2f life), cancel away!<br /><br />That being said, be sure to read a vendor&#039;s profile page for their policies as well.&nbsp; For me personally, I&#039;m only able to ship Mondays and Fridays (pre-commute and post-commute because I work out of my city during the week and do not have product at that time), and it&#039;s made very clear on my profile page that the cutoff time for shipments is the night before (because I usually have to package at like 4 in the morning before I hit the highway).&nbsp; So if a buyer orders at 8am on a monday morning, it&#039;s not going to get shipped until after I get back from work on Friday, which is usually the afternoon, which means there will be a short stretch where it&#039;s Past Due.&nbsp; Big pet peeve of mine is when I package something up and go back to mark &quot;in transit&quot; on my way out the door and the order has been cancelled.&nbsp; Not the buyer&#039;s fault per se, but it&#039;s still a pain in the ass.<br /><br />Anarcho47
