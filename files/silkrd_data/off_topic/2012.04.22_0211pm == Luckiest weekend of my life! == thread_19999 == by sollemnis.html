				I&#039;ve always been one for the weekends but wow, this has been the weekend of a life time! My package came through on Sat, 2 grams of base, gram of MDMA and a gram of drone. Yesterday I must say was amazing, bombed 200mgs of MDMA... had a fantastic roll since I quit for a while (lost the magic a little), as I was coming down I had a cheeky line of drone... The euphoria at that point was entirely overwhelming! I was appreciating all the good moments in my life! If heaven does exist, it can&#039;t compare with that!<br /><br />Later on I had a few dabs of base... Speeding my arse of all night, got maybe 4 hours sleep! Which is a lot for me... normally I&#039;m up all night after a few dabs of speed!<br /><br />Woke up this morning, logged on to SR... Guess what? I&#039;ve only won a 420 sale prize! 20 BTC gift code to be exact :D... Well safe to say I&#039;ve ordered some more base, 5 grams of the shit! I&#039;ve had a few more dabs this morning to get me going, I&#039;m here speeding my ass of in pure bliss at how lucky I was!<br /><br />Thank you to all the AMAZING people of this community! It has changed my life for sure. No more cut up street grade crap... Well thats all I have to say, please feel free to post about your weekend! I know mine was truly amazing...<br /><br /><br />Sollemnis

				Drone = Mephedrone... It&#039;s very euphoric.. I find that taking that just as I&#039;m coming down from mdma really does extend the roll a little. Makes it more stimulating (and in my opinion more euphoric) <br /><br />And yeah, speed isn&#039;t for everyone... But I love it personally, great to save sex on! (Talk about dirty thoughts lol) I&#039;m just astonished that I won a prize... Wasn&#039;t expecting that at all!<br /><br />Sollemnis
