				I am tired of seeing misinformation. BHO is NOT honey oil. Honey oil a form of refinement of ANY hash oil. Sooo what this means... <br />Black Oil - Lowest Refinement<br />Brown Oil- Second Lowest<br />Light Brown <br />Orange (Not see through)<br />Amber<br />Honey<br />White<br /><br />These are the grades of hash oil. Honey Oil involves cleaning with acetone, dewaxing, and cleaning with charcoal. Hash Oil does not have to be extracted using Butane but is cheap and easy, though the resulting product is very impure it is quite delicious. However with a little work BHO can be Honey Oil. They are just two different things.. and It&#039;s starting to irritate me to see some much false advertising Cannabis Section.<br /><br />Be Informed as a buyer and as a seller. If you are selling a product it is up to YOU to know what it is!<br /><br />Flustered,<br />DigitalAlch

				I have a slight argument , but I do agree with you fully. <br /><br />BHO , as an acronym stands for &#039;Butane Honey Oil&#039; but does not mean that the oil will be the lovely honey coloration/purity.<br /><br />The argument I present is : <br /><br />Butane is a much more polar solvent with less additives/oils and evaporates more cleanly.&nbsp; Get the top end butane (its expensive) and it&#039;s amazing for oil quality.<br /><br />Acetone is not a &quot;superior&quot; method for extraction over butane, however, they&#039;re about the same.&nbsp; The purity and cleanliness of both Butane and Acetone vary greatly and the best butane is about the same as the best acetone.&nbsp; Both solvents contain unwanted materials for the lungs, but they both evaporate very quickly, work well as a solvent for THC/CBD and are relatively cheap.&nbsp; <br /><br />The coloring of the oil itself is rarely dependent upon the solvent, black/brown/greener oils contain a lot of plant material and extra nonsense that negatively impacts both the flavor and the potency of the product, while the more transparent honey oils are usually made with top notch starting product and a high end solvent. <br /><br />I&#039;m with you though DigitalAlch, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d buy oil off of here, its too variable in potency/consistency&nbsp; and warrants a hefty price tag!<br /><br />I&#039;m curious as to your thoughts on the acetone though, I try to avoid acetone altogether =/<br /><br />THC addict,<br />-wicked420

I think a more accurate name for BHO is Butane Hash Oil (As I have always known it be), and yes I agree the selection of butane is everything. I buy very specific butane for just this reason, what I am saying is refine BHO with Acetone and you achieve real honey oil - http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/imgzapr/upload/hun.jpg (Not me in photo) . Let me break down the refinement process and what it does - <br />&nbsp;First make your solvent based Hash Oil. When thats done the following steps can be taken in refinement: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Take a jar and add near boiling water (making sure the jar is hot first). (Only fill the jar 2/3 of the way full. Glass jars work best, gallon jar for big batches, pint for small)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Add oil via spoon + blade, then put the lid on somewhat loosely&nbsp; (Observe that oil is sitting on top of the water? It is creating two phases.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Over the sink lightly shake the jar and depressurize the jar by loosening the lid and allowing air exchange, repeat (Notice that the two phases temporarily mix? As soon as you stop shaking the non-polar phase rises, but not before the water-soluble compounds such as chlorophyll and some other non-psychoactives are left behind.)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Close the lid tightly, shaking more vigorously this time. Give it a minute to settle, then repeat. Continue this cycle 5 - 10 times. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Place the jar in a warm water bath, then progressively bring the temperature down. (Bring the temperature of the the glass down slowly so it dosn&#039;t shatter. )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. When the water inside the jar gets very cold the hash oil should become somewhat solid, retrieve this. Then filter the remaining water through a coffee filter, keeping the hash oil and discarding water when done.&nbsp; (As the water gets cold the oil will harden and consolidate, making a puck that can be retrieved)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Place oil in stainless steel bowl and chase water out with a hair dryer on high, taking care not to burn the oil. (Get out all the water seriously, after you think it is all chased out let it sit for 25 minutes)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Dewaxing: Make a hot water bath. Take a jar and place it 3/4 of the way full with Acetone, then place in hot water bath. After it is pretty warm, take it out of the hot water bath and add the oil.&nbsp; Stir it in well. Place the lid on and give it a few light swirls to mix them further. Place jar back in hot water bath, and run the faucet over it (hot as it will come out of the faucet)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Dewaxing: Slowly bring down the temperature of the faucet/water bath, cooler, cooler, cold. Now it should be a cold water bath. Keep it in there for an hour.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Dewaxing: Put it in the fridge for 8 hours. After this, while still cold, pour through a coffee filter. You know have a bunch of wax and you have hash oil. You could pour acetone through this wax and use it for common wax uses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Add some acetone to a jar of dewaxed oil. Stir in with a spoon.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Add a few spoon fulls of activated charcoal. Add lid and swirl. Let sit overnight.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Now siphon the liquid into another jar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Now evaporate the solvent very well. A hair dryer may be used to speed this process up.<br /><br />You see this removes the water soluble materials, the color related impurities and more. Now, keep in mind I use this for my ether extractions, and this is my first time using it with BHO but it should work the same.&nbsp; Thanks for the questions, it helps others learn. Not mention I could always be mistaken and I love to learn, so I am always glad to have mistakes corrected.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch<br /><br />

				Thanks. I&#039;ve gotten my hands on honey oil once, good stuff. Really cool to have this stuff lying around, just has a great wow factor for me.

				Sweet. Thanks, DA...I&#039;ve been looking into making some oil and this helps..I&#039;d never heard of the acetone refinement process.<br /><br />Any suggestions on which butane is the purest?

				Good info:<br />&nbsp;I would think 99% IPA&nbsp; might help to clean that up, or even used as an extraction?!<br />Ive never had true &quot;Honey&quot; oil, but always dreamed of trying it.
