				I have done almost every drug, and enjoy/liked all of them besides for cannabis. I&#039;m not sure why but whenever i smoke i get very anxious and i get panic attacks and I feel very spaced out and its not a pleasent feeling for me.. Which is really weird because I love acid and i enjoy doing shrooms every once in awhile, it just seems like weed is more intense than acid is for me, i dont know why that is.<br />So i was just curious do other ppl out there not like cannabis or is it just me?

				I LOVE cannabis now, but rewind 3-4 years back and i couldn&#039;t smoke it. spaced me out, made me nervous and unsociable and almost always made me that annoying kind of &quot;people know I&#039;m high @_o&quot; paranoid. I drank way too much back then, though.&nbsp; and did blow. lotzz of blow. <br /><br />Now, i have access to any kind of drug i want, as well as vendors and other users who are knowledgeable and happy to school me on their favorites. I have tried some new things... ghb, mdma, and meph are my new favorite party drugs :)&nbsp; but there&#039;s nothing i like as much as &lt;3 cannnabis &lt;333 <br /><br />POTHEAD 4 EVA

				i know a few ex stoners who won&#039;t smoke anymore because of paranoia and they used to be fine. it depends on the individual. some drugs just don&#039;t agree with certain people. opiates don&#039;t do anything much for me which is awesome unless i genuinely need strong pain relief and have no spliff, then i&#039;m screwed like now. i&#039;d say setting is very important but you know that if you trip. i think the strong smell and the fact it&#039;s illegal can induce paranoia if you&#039;re smoking in your home/public as opposed to in your toker friendly hotel in amsterdam... i fucking love all types of cannabis but it&#039;s not a one size fits all kinda thing.

				I used to smoke so much weed... and then something happened.. I&#039;m not quite sure what but now everytime I smoke I get really anxious, verging on panic attacks. It&#039;s hard because I still have an addiction for weed so I keep smoking it...

				I used to smoke up everyday. Then I found harder drugs and I was like, &quot;I have been doing some pussy shit for years.&quot; First time I did acid I was like fuck weed I&#039;m dropping acid everyday. From there it just kept getting crazier and crazier.<br /><br />Chaos

				i did it for 20 years daily and i continued with it as dependency on it even though i was anxious and all that shit plus my lungs were fucked. kept putting off life till i quit it and at the same time used it as an excyuse not to live to my full potential.. then 14b months ago finally quit it and never looked back. <br /><br />started getting powders on the sil road and in comparison the hard drugs are so much more valuable than the high and experience weed can give me.. when the hard drugs from sr came in not only did weed become worthless but alcohol just became something i have no interest in. so essential a coke high made me &quot;chuck away shit drugs&quot; like alcohol and weed.<br /><br />this year i started on the meth and when i got my &quot;this is it&quot; high i instantly devalued the core base of other drugs like lsd, 2-cb. ghb, mdma, coke. it was like i found the best high and the other drugs just dont cut the mustard. i still like them more than weed and alchohol though.<br /><br />whatever happens to me on meth.. if my teeth fall out or whatever.. ill do my best to avoid the traps. meth is vastly way more dangerous but id rather walk on thin ice with meth than cough my lungs up on a crappy weed high that lasts shitfuck all and makes me anxious.<br /><br />weed in my exerience make me feel miserable and silkroad showed me that you can take drugs that last longer and have more pleasant feelings.. good cocaine makes a weed high seem like smoking cowshit.<br /><br />all my opinion and experience though, no disrespect to the cannabis connoisseurs and i know its enjoyable and rewarding pastime for folks to settle back with on an evening. if you enjoy it like your a wine taster enjoys wine then more power to you.

				Try experimenting with different strains if you haven&#039;t already. A good strong indica will probably be best for anxiety, although it obviously varies from person to person. The cerebral sativa high can sometimes amplify whatever anxiety or paranoia you&#039;ve got going on in your head. But yeah, as others have said, some drugs just don&#039;t agree with certain people, for whatever reason.

				I smoked several times a day for probably 4 or 5 years. I grew, I sold, I smoked, I cooked edibles. I was all over the cannabis culture. I really enjoyed it for sometime. A couple years back it changed for me, I stated to get wicked anxiety from whatever I smoked, bud or hash. It was strange but I didn&#039;t really have much say in it, was all my body saying no. I burned my stash and didn&#039;t regret it, haven&#039;t craved it since I stopped.

				Again, you guys are just generically referring to cannabis as if it is all the same. It can actually be quite effective for treating anxiety in a lot of people. If you find the right strain you might completely change your opinions. If you&#039;ve already completely written it off, that&#039;s cool too. Like I said before, certain drugs just don&#039;t agree with some people for one reason or another, and that very well may be the case with you.<br /><br />Just offering some suggestions. :)

				I used to smoke everyday from mid teens to mid twenties. Used to love it. cant smoke it now because it gives me anxiety and paranoia to the max. Not good. Anyhow its an expensive habit and made me lazy so its not too bad. Ive smoked it when on benzos and that seems to get rid of the anxiety, but its not something you could do everyday, or you would be like the walking dead. made the mistake of eating a brownie in amsterdam last year. Sent my head sideways, met these really rough scottish guys who came and sat with me and my girlfriend. Usually im quite sociable, but weed makes me into a social spastic and it really freaked me out. Weed just makes some people paranoid and anxious, thats just how it is.

				I hate weed - which is funny since I smoked it for about 5 years :(<br /><br />I just noticed it started affecting me differently, felt more paranoid and anxiety so I just quit. I kinda stopped liking the feeling of the high as well its hard to describe but some people on here will know what I mean.<br /><br />Quitting has almost realised how much it stinks when your smoking a joint, which clings to my clothes etc.<br /><br />Though I still love the smell of weed in bud form :) I swear someone should make it into an air freshner somehow, might get a few akward moments if the police where to pull you over though :)

				I used to smoke 24/7 for about 8 years.. like before work.. during work.. after work.. had a professional job and functioned 100% but when your smoking all the time it barely has any effect on you. It used to be like - going to pick up milk, goto have a cone.. going to walk the dog.. goto have a cone.. etc etc. First few years it was great.. then it had reverse effect and I had to smoke to feel normal.. when I tried to quit I got depressed and what not. <br /><br />anywho.. I stopped finally a few years back (yay!) and I&#039;ve tried once or twice since then and I hate the feeling now.. I get really anxious and its just not a nice feeling at all... hard to explain, but yeah, pretty much everything OP mentioned..&nbsp; I hate it, now. Everything else is good to go :)

				so ive been off weed for 14 months and a few months back i went to a friends house and he smokes allot of wed.&nbsp; though i only ate weed the last years of use i watched how he packed and had a cone every 20 minutes or so and i didnt say nothing to him but i really wondered &quot;darn, thats your 5th cone.. is it even working??&quot;<br /><br />maybe he got small hits but they would have lasted long and he had a bong cough... still i guess its better than doing heavy drugs like coke every 20 minutes for years.

				Fascinating thread and I hope it gets a lot more input. Seems like a definite trend with some tokers experiencing anxiety late in the game and from that point on. Very curious what&#039;s behind that.<br /><br />I&#039;m chiming in because, for me, I got nothing positive out of mj for years. I&#039;d occasionally try and just feel cloudy-headed and unpleasant. I am still trying to put my finger on what changed, because one day I smoked some pot and it was FANTASTIC. Completely different. Lucidity-enabling, rather than crippling. And I thought wow, this stuff can be genuinely good. Before that point I could not have imagined cannabis *improving* my mental state (other than mood).<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if that was a change from cheap stuff to good, or a strain difference. Maybe I&#039;d been toking indica to that point and this was a sativa? I don&#039;t know. Now, with SR, well, I don&#039;t smoke at all. I vape, and only the good stuff, primarily sativa or mixed strains. I&#039;ve also upgraded equipment (to a volcano from a cheap Chinese box whip) and that also makes a hell of a difference.<br /><br />Of course, mj is a stealth-difficult item, so I know a lot of people don&#039;t get it from the Road, but if any of the anxious tokers have already identified one of SR&#039;s stealth wizards who vends the stuff, you may want to give it another go just to see.<br /><br />I still gag at the thought of some unstrained cannabis butter I choked down not too long ago, though. Ugh. I just shuddered typing that.

I believe it&#039;s something to do with the subconscious psyche. I stopped smoking weed for quite a while after I went to rehab (I was there for harder drugs). It was in rehab that I learned how addicted to weed I actually was. I realized I was constantly after that immediate gratification that I got from weed. It&#039;s been since then that I started having bad experiences with weed (every time I smoked). I believe subconsciously I know that smoking weed has never been productive for me and if anything it&#039;s the main contributor to my social anxiety. It was only recently (over the past year) that I started making those connections. <br /><br />I think once you start questioning why you smoke weed and observing the implications of your weed usage, something changes neurologically.<br /><br />Of course this is all speculation but it makes sense to me.

				Please stop. the more I read this thread, the sadder I get, not just for everyone who doesn&#039;t like weed, but also for me. I see where you guys have been and see I might be heading down the same road. Good thing is that weed isn&#039;t physically addicting and if you had the will power, a person can stop smoking weed.
