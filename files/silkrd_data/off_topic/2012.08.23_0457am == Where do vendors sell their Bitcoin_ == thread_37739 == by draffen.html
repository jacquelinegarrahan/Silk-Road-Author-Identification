				Question for vendors: How do you end up disposing of your BTC? Do you find people locally for cash transactions (localbitcoin, btcnearme, etc.), use bank deposits, or what?<br /><br />I suppose I&#039;m assuming that most vendors *do* cash in, rather than investing. And I can&#039;t imagine the Bitcoin economy is complete enough yet that you can just make purchases with BTC that you would normally make with fiat currency...<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m being too nosy, but I&#039;m really curious how other people are handling the BTC-fiat exchange, and I figure vendors have more trouble with that than most.<br /><br />ETA: Oh, looks like I should be reading the Security forum -- lots of threads over there about bank deposits and the like.

				Yeah. You are being nosy.<br /><br />with that said. You can buy gold for BTC, But you would be betting on gold to continue to trend upwards. <br /><br />I do not know what the current fees are, but I bought gold with BTC once (a longe time ago, before SR) and I got raped.<br /><br />Its doubly risky as you are betting two markets instead of just one (BTC or GOLD)<br /><br />I do however keep my eye on the gold market and needless to say the BTC, but this is totally unrelated to SR.<br /><br />Anyone wanna buy some gold? :)<br /><br />Can we sell gold on SR?
