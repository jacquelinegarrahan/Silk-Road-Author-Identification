				I used to have one with my real info until I noticed how much it compromised my privacy. I then deleted it and remade one with fake info just to keep in touch with really close friends and play some of the games in the little free time that I have.

				ive never had a myspace, facebook or twitter or any other shit like that. i dont want anyone to have a profile on me, or know my status or location or my favorite color even. seems like one day all that facebook shit could be used against you, and i think its creepy to let thousands of strangers see my pictures and know basic shit about me and i know who they could be. another huge reason i never had any of that shit is for if any of my friends were to get busted for something major i dont want the LE to look at his top ten friends and there i am. i dont want to make it easier for them.
