				fuck, my life would be so much better if I never let myself play this game.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think the US should start a war on video games, these things are WAY more addicting and destructive than drugs

				Not to hijack the thread, but what about Diablo 3? Looks like they are going to miss yet another holiday gift season. They were showing playable parts of the game 2 year ago...<br /><br />Aiyah!

Add another few months on top of whatever release date is announced.

				Picked it up on release date, haven&#039;t had enough time to play it much yet. I&#039;ve only just killed the first dragon :(<br /><br />For those who haven&#039;t heard, it&#039;s been discovered that the entire environments for Cyrodil and Morrowind have been mapped and included in Skyrim, but are inaccessible at the moment. Huge future DLC, hopefully!<br />

				Chez, I hadn&#039;t heard that, that&#039;s awesome! I too am about 60 hours in, one of the funniest bugs I have seen was when I decpitated a bandit and their head just kind of floated around in the air for awhile. It&#039;s an awesome game, it&#039;s easily going to be a 200 hour plus game, oblivion was like for me too. What are you guys playing as? I am playing a female nord. I always go warrior on rpgs for some reason.

				Been enjoying this game as well I must add. Had some issues though, one of the main quest will not give me the quest item needed so it never works. Sad. Waiting on the patches, and having fun with the side quest. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch
