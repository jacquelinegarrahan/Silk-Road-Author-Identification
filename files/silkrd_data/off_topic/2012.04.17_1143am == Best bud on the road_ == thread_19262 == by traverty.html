				There is no such thing as the best, it all depends on if you want a Sativa or Indica or even a good hybrid that gives you some of each. It always makes me laugh when someone says this sellers has the best, it might be the best for them the effects they like but not the same type everyone is looking for so first you have to figure out what type you are really looking for.

				You might have better luck posting in the rumour mill. AAA and AAAA listed items are the best, with AAAA being just about as good as you&#039;re going to get with the weed genetics we&#039;ve got so far on earth.

				Depends on your flavour mate...<br /><br />I have a couple of favourite strains depending on my mood and/or what level of stoned-ness I need.

				It all depends on what you&#039;re looking for.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; Lots of vendors will be selling stuff cheap (myself included) take a peek around and decide what&#039;s right for you, that&#039;s half the fun!

				Doesn&#039;t everyone think their stuff is the best? :/<br /><br />Regardless, I have respect for all of my fellow bud vendors and have bought from many of them. Diversity, that is what it is about. Maybe some are cheaper than others, maybe some are REALLY high priced, but you have a LARGE variety to choose from. Something different all the time.

				CannaGrrl has the most fire I&#039;ve encountered so far on SR, but it&#039;s not cheap. Definitely some prime buds though.

				The best value I&#039;ve come across were Rocker&#039;s ounces. Always extremely fast to ship and very high quality. I&#039;m not sure if Rocker still has any weed listings up though.
