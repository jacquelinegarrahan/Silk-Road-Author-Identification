				Decided to try to m-hole as a treat to my myself since I just got some MXE and hadn&#039;t had some in a long time. I waited until after my bedtime and took some and then m-holed. Then my cat wanted in my room. My brother noticed this and knocked on me door to let me know. Not hearing a response they picked my lock and found me unresponsive to their attempts to wake me up. Then the cops and ambulance were called and I lost about 1.5 oz of mushrooms, nearly an ounce of weed left, a gram of mxe and all of my booze was destroyed for some reason (I have crazy parents). So supposedly my mother had to give me mouth to mouth (my mom&#039;s a little crazy and I&#039;m not sure she needed to) although I remember talking to the ambulance people thinking they were a crazy hallucination. Anyway, now I have a &#039;meeting&#039; with the cops sometime this afternoon. FML.

				Been there done that :D<br /><br />After my first month of madness with MXE I&#039;d gone as far as 150mg and while it was a bizarre experience I was still in control. Cranking it up to 200mg was a *bad* idea. My parents thought I&#039;d suffered some sort of psychotic break and took me to hospital, kicking and screaming. I remember thinking I was trapped in a mental institution forever. My whole life had been a sham, a fantasy, I&#039;d never been outside the walls of the institution. The person I&#039;d considered my mother all this time? Just a nurse (she was in fact my mother, I was just totally fucked). I had to escape. I tried removing the ceiling vent and going through there. Eventually I overpowered the &#039;nurse&#039; and opened the door and got out onto the ward; there were big burly men at either end of the corridor. I sensed something was wrong and went back into the room. I later learned that they&#039;d locked down the ward because of me and were seconds away from giving me an asskicking I would never forget.<br /><br />It took me about 24 hours to learn to walk properly again. I also have a bizarre recollection of the hospital being underground, even though it definitely wasn&#039;t.

				Cerealbox, you are on a fucked up trajectory, stop the drugs for a while, try meditation. <br />For your own sake, if that isn&#039;t important enough, for your family&#039;s sake.

				Been there myself so I registered to give you the advice I wish somebody gave me.<br /><br />I ended up in hospital a few years back, more or less indifferent to staying alive and unable to walk.. I was shitting myself and pissing myself and basically insane, ranting and raving, I fucked up every single aspect of my life in a few years. It was the most undignified humbling experience of my life. I was extremely lucky to be alive tho, I later learned a few more days &#039;under the clouds&#039; would have been it.

I cannot recommend this enough.<br /><br />The first time I achieved &#039;a really nice meditation&#039;, I would say it was like natural free heroin but better. And yes, I have done a lot of it so I can say that.

Why had nobody told me this was accessible all along? Free inside my own mind, with no side-effects..<br />&nbsp;<br />I think it&#039;s great to experiment with all mind-expanding substances, I believe they can take your hand and &#039;show you the way&#039;. They can be a short-cut to these profound states.<br /><br />But once you have truly been around the block, you have done them all to excess many times, you are old and such an experience is draining, then you must use your own mind to create the conditions for profound states of being.

				(New account)<br /><br />Keep at it, but try some different explanations for &#039;how to meditate&#039;. There are many different ways, you just have to find the right method for yourself.<br /><br />This one worked for me for some reason: http://what-buddha-taught.net/Books/Ajahn_Brahm_Basic_Method_of_Meditation.htm<br /><br />I had the same experience tho, for years I would &#039;meditate&#039; but never really get anywhere.. Sure it was slightly relaxing but that was it. When people told me &#039;it was as good as drugs&#039; I thought they were ignorant and didn&#039;t have access to proper drugs. They were fucking right, it&#039;s better, it&#039;s one of the reasons I loved drugs so much - for their ability to shortcut my way to these profound states.<br /><br />One time I got the technique right, finally, and experienced such a release and state of pure bliss - I knew I had touched on something big, so I kept at it, practicing and reading the talks monks give at meditation retreats.<br /><br />That book gives an excellent description on how to reach the first stages in Meditation, even these first stages are very blissful and profound. Don&#039;t give up :)

Good, now perfect it so your mind is literally akin to the condition of non-existence except focusing on breathing. It considerably increases your attention span too!

				My sympathies bro. I know that sucks. I would agree with what everyone else is saying: Chill out for a while, and stay clean. Apologize profusely to your parents and family, and be the &#039;good little recovered son&#039;. Maybe even start saving cash, you have a job? Get a place, and then do whatever the fuck you want.<br /><br />See if you can find some cool people to room with, and cut the costs of living by thirds.

				Agreed. I don&#039;t mean to negatively judge. There is just something in the back of my head that finds it strange and a little bad when kids under the age of 18 do drugs. Perhaps that&#039;s just me and my weird morals though.

				I have mixed feelings about this issue.<br /><br />When I was a minor, I did copious amounts of drugs. So I&#039;d be a hypocrite to judge. God what a field day I&#039;d have had with access to this site when I was in high school.<br /><br />And I think if the dude is smart enough to find this site (I know, it&#039;s not THAT big of an achievement... but most adults, let alone kids his age, still wouldn&#039;t be able to figure it out, even with the browser bundle, and gawker staring at them), then I think he&#039;s capable of deciding what drugs he wants to do, especially considering some of the people who legally have access to alcohol.<br /><br />On the other hand the guy may deserve to do his drugs and perfectly capable of deciding whether or not he wants to scare the fuck out of his parents like that, but some parental figures I&#039;ve observed in other people&#039;s lives can be just ridiculously overprotective, and ready to justify the actions of their perfect-crotchfruit-which-can-do-no-harm by blaming them on anything they can, us included. So this is worrisome.
