				Seen this post going around on facebook and really rubbed me the wrong way:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Molly has been a common drug lately &amp; everyone is trying it. Pop 1 and your sweating? Let me explain why your sweating: Molly is a drug made up of cocaine, crack, ecstasy, meth &amp; bath salt. It slows your heart rate 10x the normal limit &amp; reeks havoc on your immune system with just one pill. Take two &amp; it damages your brain without you even being able realize it. It becomes an addiction &amp; soon a cry for help. By the fifth one you take, it starts killing your organs &amp; preventing them from functioning as normal. It increases your chance of stroke &amp; heart attack and can cause your lungs to stop functioning all together! It is a very powerful &amp; VERY DANGEROUS drug! More harmful than crack itself. Many rappers are promoting it to involve young people in the manufacturing, selling, and usage of the drug. Spread the word to save lives of young people across the country! Show them the truth so they can make an informed &amp; smart decision if they&#039;re ever offered it</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Miseducation is the biggest killer out of drugs...tell people lies and then when they take drugs and realise they have been lied to in one instance they are likely to not go careful with other things that need it. kids who are told weed is super addictive, try and realise it isnt so then jump to shoot up smack.
