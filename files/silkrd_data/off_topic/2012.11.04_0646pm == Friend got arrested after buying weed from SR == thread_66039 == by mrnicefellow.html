				A guy I know bought a few grams of hash from the vendor Swee about a week ago, and thursday evening, the cops raided his house, made him admit to everything (no previous record, was scared shitless etc). They had brought a dog who found everything. They asked lots of questions about SR and they seemed to know exactly how much he had bought. Swee hasn&#039;t been online for six days or so, ie before the police made a house call to my friend. Just thought you all should know.<br /><br />Not sure if this is the correct forum, tried to figure out which one was most appropriate, but if this is the wrong one then feel free to move it.<br /><br />EDIT: both vendor and buyer are located in Sweden, btw

				Here&#039;s a great reason to make your delivery address different from your home address. I have a feeling that we haven&#039;t heard the last of the &#039;Cops broke down my door after I ordered on SR&#039; stories.<br /><br />Sloppy security just makes LEO&#039;s job easier. If they want to bust us, let&#039;s do our best to make them work for it!&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />On an unrelated note, did you know that Sweden IMPORTS nearly a million tons of garbage every year? Those progressive fuckers are burning it to heat homes. They&#039;re burning it because landfills are fucking ILLEGAL in Sweden. <br /><br /><br />

				Sure, not ordering to your home adress is fine and all, but what scared me was the fact that the cops obviously busted the vendor before knocking on my friend&#039;s door. Has law enforcement, even such a crappy one as in Sweden, become so good at tracking down SR vendors?

				Are you sure the vendor was busted for the sales they did over SR, or for sales they did in-person?&nbsp; If a vendor follows protocol, there&#039;s really no way LE can track a package back to them.<br /><br />My guess is the vendor got busted for in-person deals, when the cops raided his place they found evidence of him selling over SR and then went after anyone he sold to in your home country (primarily to build a case against Swee.)&nbsp; I can&#039;t see them chasing people outside of Sweden for buying, though.

				It is of course very possible that the Vendor was stupid enough to do sales in-person. Even so, that means that he somehow kept record of whom he sold weed to through SR. Very sloppy.<br /><br />He also pointed out specifically on his profile that he didn&#039;t vacuum-pack the stuff, but that it was &quot;safe anyway&quot;.

				My guess would be the vendor got busted, and gave away his customers&#039; names and addresses. This why customers should leave feedback about both the quality of the product and stealth of packaging/overall security impression from the vendor.

				I say BULLSHIT, these threads pop up from time to time and if you analyze what has been said, it doesn&#039;t add up- if the police knew how much had been ordered, they would not wait a few days- your average regular toker could smoke that amount in an afternoon- they know that, so why wait until the evidence has been smoked, plus it is a lot of police resources for a tiny amount, I don&#039;t know what Swedish Police protocols are for cannabis, but in many countries, even the UK (which is pretty strict), a few grams would only incur a caution.

				For those of you who claim what I say is bullshit, I&#039;m sorry but I don&#039;t really care.<br /><br />My point is not to whine over someone who orders cannabis without vacuum-sealed package, the point is that the vendor was arrested and they knew whom he had sold to. The vendor Swee<br /><br />( http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion.to/index.php/silkroad/user/9ed4843235) <br /><br />hasn&#039;t been online since a day before my friend was busted.

				There&#039;s no way LE would setup an account and sell real drugs , also there&#039;s no way the package got intercepted then delivered and they let the buyer for a week to enjoy the product. That&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />The only plausible scenario, if the story is real, is that the vendor got raided and police found about what he was selling and to whom, but even then it&#039;s at least impressing they got a warrant for a small buyer who maybe had already smoked the product. Though i m sure cops would get a hard-on by arresting SR members, so I can&#039;t be sure if its real or not...<br />

				This is kinda concerning. My hunch is that customs and Swedish police is focused on swedes using SR/BTC. So if this bust is true, I am not surprised that they cracked down on your friend even though the amount was small, since Swedish law has zero tolerance for any narcotics, and if the objective indeed is to attack SR users the amount of drugs is irrelevant<br /><br />I&#039;m not aware of what/if Swee offered any other products than weed, or how he got hold of his products himself. Might it be the case that he re-sold products and/or purchased something else&nbsp; internationally on SR? If that is the case a package could have been intercepted by customs and the police got involved somehow. leading up to an arrest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I didn&#039;t want to name the thread &quot;SR vendor + customer busted&quot; since I&#039;m not sure Swee was actually arrested by swedish LE. It seems pretty damn likely that he was, but I wanted to go on just what actual facts I had.<br /><br />How Swee was arrested is up for speculation. Maybe customs got their eyes on him when he purchased what he later sold on to other customers, maybe he made RL deals and the police caught him etc, but the big mystery is:<br /><br />How come the customer was arrested at least a couple of weeks after he bought the stuff? It does seem strange that Swee would keep a file with records of all his customers (unless maybe he printed out address stickers in Word or something). If that wasn&#039;t the case, how could the LE catch the customer?
