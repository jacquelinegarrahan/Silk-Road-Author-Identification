				The bitcoins I was supposed to receive today never came because it was a &#039;high risk&#039;&#039; transaction. Coinbase can suck a fatty...can someone please direct me to a similar online bitcoin purchasing website that DOESNT require me to wait a week on my first transaction?

				Go to localbitcoins.com<br />Do a transaction face to face<br />If you want you can try without f2f, but, make sure that escrow is funded and active before you pay.<br /><br />If you have been sending all of your coins to the same btc wallet, get a new one.&nbsp; If they said that you are high risk then they obviously see the shady stuff going on with your account.&nbsp;

				Dude this is the first time in my life that I&#039;ve ever even attempted to buy bitcoins. My banks account is fine, im not a shady person im a regular guy. I didnt have a btc wallet before yesterday. So I dont really see a reason why they would have done that?

				Could be your band new wallet? I agree though with localbitcoin, a f2f transaction for a little more then you would pay for a coin online is well worth it! Take this case alone you lost how much cash for a coin when you could have paid a little more to get the coins you needed right then and there! Just IMO

If it is under 100$, alot of people have that sitting in their acc from transaction surplus.&nbsp; &lt;--That last one is pretty risky, if you do it try to find a VERY reputable member of the forums
