				Sorry if I have missed this thread somewhere - can someone give recommendations for a good vape for bud?&nbsp; I guess things that would be important to me include being discreet, small,&nbsp; and minimizing odors if at all possible. I saw someone mention the Magic Flight Launch Box - good choice?&nbsp; Pro&#039;s, Con&#039;s, Others?<br /><br />Thanks!&nbsp; 8)

				I own a Magic Flight Launch Box - you get a great heady high from vaping with this. :D<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to use much in the tray, which might save some people on bud. It runs on batteries and comes with 2 AAs to start you off, though I ended up buying more powerful batteries (IMEDION 2400 mAh) due to the original ones losing their capacity after a while. :/<br /><br />The dimensions of the box are 7.5cm(L)x4cm(W)x2.3cm(D).<br /><br />As for odour control, the mflb is pretty damn good but it does give off a burnt popcorn-like smell if you hold the battery in for too long, or let any vapour escape... Nothing an open window or some air freshener can&#039;t fix.<br /><br />Actually using it is a bit of a learning curve for some - you have to control the temperature with your tokes (ideally speaking, you want to use it like you&#039;re sipping out of a straw). There&#039;s a nice tutorial on vaporpedia.com.<br /><br />For vaporiser size, I guess the Iolite is the closest matching. There&#039;s also the VaporGenie which is a lot cheaper, and functions as a pipe too.

				I have the newest Vapir one and love it. Come with either a tube for direct smoking as well as 5 bags you can fill and sit with. The only draw back I have with it is that the fan is super loud.

				I actually just got the Dragon Lite mini vape and it is fucking awesome. It&#039;s a rip off of the MFLB but works exactly the same and its only $30 with a lifetime warranty.&nbsp; (+ $20 for batteries/charger)<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve used this thing at work, in a movie theatre and on the bus and it produces no smell at all. So if you can&#039;t afford the MFLB I highly recommend this, it will be the best $30 you have ever spent.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also tried the original MFLB, the Iolite and the Vapir n02 and the only ones worth considering are the MFLB and the Dragon Lite. <br /><br />

				The Herbalaire vaporizer is highly recommended.&nbsp; If you like the Volcano&#039;s bag system, the herbalaire can also blow up a bag with vapor, or you can use the included whip.<br /><br />For around $200, this is a more economical Volcano.&nbsp; $300 is the difference between an herbalaire and a volcano.&nbsp; For that price you could have bought an herbalaire AND an ounce of weed to vaporize in your new vaporizer!<br />http://www.herbalaire.com/tri.htm

				For a portable model don&#039;t choose anything else.<br />Am waiting for my Arizer Solo which is far superior to the iolite models.<br />I have tried the Arizer and was convinced after the first puff.<br />The glass pipe makes a very tasty smoke whereas the iolite has a plastic taste.<br />A friend has tested ore or less all vaporizers currently on the market and sticks with it too.<br />Check the video here:<br />**CLEARNET**<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2xoRZCsYME<br />

				Like connoisseur, I bought the Arizer Solo. It seems ok I guess but I still think that I get higher off the same amount of weed in a regular smokable blunt. I dunno maybe I&#039;m doing it wrong. <br />Anyone have any tips on the best way to use a vaporizer? Maybe I&#039;ll start a thread in the Drug Safety forum.

				Vape xhale cloud is the best on the market now. Roughly same price as the volcano, but much better. $450-600 depending on the attachments you get. <br /><br />For mid-price range, the PLENTY vape is excellent @ $315 from ezvapes with their standard coupon. <br /><br />For low level, the Extreme-Q is great for the price. I got it for $164 from ezvapes or vapeworld. I don&#039;t remeber, but they had a &quot;price match&quot; guarantee, so I just found it on some sketchy site, and they matched it with great shipping and legitimacy. <br /><br />I don&#039;t vape on the go, so I have nothing to say about portables. IMO, they never hit as hard as I&#039;d like and for the money you&#039;re better off getting a plug-in one. Also, spend the money and don&#039;t get anything less than what I&#039;ve recommended.. you won&#039;t regret it. <br /><br />Also, I have nothing but good things to say for both vapeworld and ezvapes. They both have the best customer service, quick stealth shipping (if that even matters), and are just all around easy to deal with. The only portable vape I ever got I ordered off of vapeworld and they fucked up and sent me TWO. My lucky fucking day!

				Really good thread, lot of recommendations to check out. I&#039;ve got a whip style vaporwarez &amp; have been using it for years but I&#039;m interested in changing up soon.

Having a screen in the glass piece significantly improves results. Vapor starts at level 3, increase temp every other hit. I&#039;ve put hash, weed, even oils through mine - all worked great.

				Timely thread. Shopping for a vape to replace my cheap Chinese box whip.<br /><br />Must have read and watched a couple of hundred reviews today, spending a lot of time particularly trying to compare the Volcano against the Xhale Cloud. The Xhale is pretty cool, but frankly I want the freedom of bags. It&#039;s the cano for oldtoby. Probably get the classic although more precise temp control would be handy for spice.

I like the xhale because of the excellent control it gives you. It reminds me of the control you&#039;d get with a head wand or gun. The quality is also better than the volcano. It delivers the highest quality vapor at a thickness that I thought was impossible with a vaporizer. It&#039;s also the first that&#039;s neither whip nor bag. It&#039;s literally a vapor-bong. While I love the volcano and would still haven&#039;t if it wasn&#039;t so branded and recognizable (a friend offered almost what I paid for it used). IMO, the volcano&#039;s price really should have dropped. It&#039;s an old product with new competitors. Hell, they even released the PLENTY themselves, which is great for thickness too. <br /><br />I do love the ease of a bag, but personally if smoking (vaping) gets too easy, I&#039;ll do it too damn much.&nbsp; ;D That said, it&#039;s still no challenge to use the xhale. <br /><br />Best of luck in your decision, you&#039;ll enjoy yourself either way. Vapes are something that I can always recommend spluring on. It&#039;s always worth it.

				I definitely like the monster hits you can obviously get off the xhale, or the plenty. <br /><br />But here&#039;s my routine with the cheap box. Having realized at some early point that it&#039;s building no vapour when not in use, I said to hell with pacing myself, and I started hitting the vape in sets of 5 (count to 10 or 15 or 20, hold, exhale, next hit no fresh air). Then sets of 10. Then 20. Now 25. That&#039;s 25 deep hits, no fresh air. <br /><br />I keep track because otherwise I lose track. So I know what to expect at 50 hits. At 100. At 150. At 200. (I was shroom-deprived for a long while, so I made do on mega-doses of mj, eventually blasting off and even reaching states of depersonalization at 250+...)<br /><br />And I am goddamned tired of huddling over that fucking piece of machinery. :) <br /><br />Granted, I expect to need nowhere near this many hits with an xhale. And moisturizing the vapour would be a godsend (can you imagine how raw my throat is after 150 deep hits?). But after all that, I wanna sit on my couch and watch milkdrop. I want to pick up the guitar. I want to play vids. I want bags! <br /><br />I&#039;m also slightly concerned with my, er, penchant for overdoing things, that I won&#039;t be taking proper care with the xhale equipment, getting water where it shouldn&#039;t be or maybe even breaking glass. I like that the volcano is safe in basically any state (I do plan to use it for spice) and requires basically no maintenance. The xhale is a gorgeous piece of equipment, though, no question.

				So, ah, wow. Volcano vapour is NOT to be underestimated. I was a little nonplussed at the instruction booklet that suggested I should be looking for a certain density of vapour in the bag before disengaging, but sure enough, it&#039;s thick. Doesn&#039;t really show in the videos. I&#039;ve had to curtail my usual enthusiasm, as I can quite easily pass the point of bliss and just get knocked on my ass instead.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to acquire some more freebase DMT to give this a whirl.
