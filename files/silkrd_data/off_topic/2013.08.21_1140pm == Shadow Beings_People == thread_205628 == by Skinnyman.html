				Anyone believe in shadow people ? Had any encounters or experiences and are they linked to incubus/succubus, sleep paralysis, Energy vampirism etc?<br /><br />I know when consuming certain drugs these can open up the doorways and people can see crazy shit.<br /><br />Any thoughts?

				This is the first im hearing about &quot;shadow beings&quot;, but I have something that might be similar.<br /><br />I took 2 hits of acid then smoked 40mg of DMT during the peak of the trip. I didn&#039;t breakthrough with the DMT but as soon as I exhaled the smoke about 5 or 6 full sized silhouettes of people appeared in my room and began walking around. I sat down on my bed, blinking over and over to try and see if they were real but they wouldn&#039;t go away. All they did was walk around too, they didn&#039;t look at me or talk. After maybe 45 seconds the figures faded away and it changed to my window sills and walls moving a bit, but that was really it.<br /><br />I swear to god though, I thought I was in a room with 7 fucking people. It was the coolest thing, I wasnt scared at all either. All I was thinking was &quot;holy shit this is fucking awesome&quot; the entire time 8)

				not obviously. our eyes only see a limited range. not too hard to believe other things exist that we dont see, just like others sounds exist that we dont hear because they are out of the range. pretty arrogant to think humans with our very limited sense can see hear and smell everything thats real.

				I remember reading somewhere about a solution for fearing the mysterious shadow people (or any monster), if you get scared as shit (and your body is functional) - just look at them non-stop(preferably in the eyes) and start touching yourself... <br /><br />And now seriously - this happens when i sleep on my back and don&#039;t move at all. even when you feel like you HAVE to move to be comfortable - stay in place, on your back.<br />that&#039;s when dreams and reality start mixing up - and I usually see a dark figure standing not far from me - while not being able to move. scary as hell. Last time i was trying to scream and move and my gf apparently noticed something as she woke me up completely before the dark figure can get to me.

				sleep paralysis is scary I&#039;ve had a few times.

				A lot of this can also be explained by the hypnagogic/hypnopompic phenomena. It is absolutely fantastic the types of visual and auditory imagery that these twilight states can bring.<br /><br />I encourage everybody to be on the lookout for them.

Yes, this has very much the feel of reality. The whole high strangeness feelings associated with alien abductions and close encounters go hand in hand with it as well.<br /><br />That&#039;s why Dr. Michael Persinger&#039;s research in Canada is so on target. He stimulates areas of the brain like the occipital and parietal lobes and produces these states almost on demand. However, I do believe these states are not just epiphenomena of consciousness. In many instances (which? that&#039;s the question) they are indeed real.<br /><br />MODIFICATION: I meant to write, epiphenomena of neurology instead of consciousness. Because ALL is in a very definite sense, a phenomenon of consciousness.<br /><br />goblin
