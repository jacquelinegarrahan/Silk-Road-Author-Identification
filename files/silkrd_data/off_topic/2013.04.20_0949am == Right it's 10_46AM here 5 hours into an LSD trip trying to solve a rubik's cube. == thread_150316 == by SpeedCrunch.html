				Reading the topic name made me smile. I haven&#039;t tried on lsd but I a few years back on while on my first mushroom trip I picked up a rubik&#039;s cube and started playing with it. After not making any progress I felt like I should stop and just accept the rubik&#039;s cube as it was.

				The title drew me in and I couldn&#039;t resist. HAH! I&#039;m proud of you for solving it. I was going to say look up how to solve it on an internet search engine of your choice. I hear they&#039;re easy once you know the algorithm...to those people I say I&#039;ll just stick to my drugs but thanks. Lol. Good job though.
