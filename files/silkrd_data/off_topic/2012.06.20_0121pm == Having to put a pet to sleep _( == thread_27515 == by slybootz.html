				So, I&#039;m typically not an emotional person IRL, at least when it comes to negative emotions.&nbsp; However, my cat suffered a pretty bad eye injury the other day, and I had to take him to the veterinarian.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the first time he had injured his eye, a similar situation happened just over a year ago, and one of his eyes ended up a permanent milky/non-normal color. We aren&#039;t sure of he had become blind in that eye, but he made a full recovery and was back to his happy, energetic, loving self.&nbsp; This time, however, it looks like its badly infected and there isn&#039;t much hope. He&#039;s at the vet right now, they&#039;re going to put him under anesthesia and try their best, but it&#039;s looking grim.&nbsp; They said we do have the option to take him to an expensive animal-vision specialist, but it&#039;s something way out of my budget, unfortunately.&nbsp; So, if the vet can&#039;t do anything today, it looks like our only other option is to put him down. :(. Not sure why, but I can&#039;t stop thinking about this while at work, and it&#039;s getting me a bit depressed.&nbsp; He&#039;s had a good life, about 10 years old but still with the heart and energy of when he was a kitten.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any positive words or vibes sent my way would be much appreciated!&nbsp; Not sure why I decided to post this on SR forums, but it feels good to get my feelings out in the open for once :)

				Always tough to have a sick or injured pet- they&#039;re always by your side even when everyone else has abandoned you- they love you and look up to you with unadultered loyalty, its a special relationship.&nbsp; Its tough to have to put one down- Im dreading the day I&#039;ll have to do that for my pup (hopefully years down the line) but 10 years is a good run and it seems like you care for this cat a lot.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let it suffer, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.&nbsp; There will always be other pets who will love you and you&#039;ll love them.&nbsp; They&#039;ll never be the same, but thats half the beauty of it- its a new chapter- something new to work on.&nbsp; Have yourself a few final days and enjoy what you had.&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#039;ll always have the memories and you made that cats life awesome.<br /><br />Sorry you have to go thru that- its a shit part of the life of a pet owner, but be strong man- its the circle of life

				Just try to remember all of the good and happy times, and hold on to that, and he will forever live on in your heart and mind :) Don&#039;t let it suffer, that will only make it more difficult to remember your happy times.<br />Good luck :)

				my puppy got hit by a car around her first birthday.&nbsp; her bone was hanging out from her elbow, to her paw.&nbsp; some of the bone had been ground.&nbsp; the vet who came and opened up the clinic thought they would have to amputate it.&nbsp; but, 2 days and several hours of surgery later, and she still had her leg.&nbsp; she is just now where she can start putting weight on it again.&nbsp; she still holds it up, but uses it every 3rd to 4th stride.&nbsp; <br /><br />so, don&#039;t give up hope in your vet.&nbsp; they usually love animals as much as we love our own, and will do everything possible.&nbsp; try to think positive : )&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;d recommend giving him large doses of vitamin C, it&#039;ll have been worth it if it works.

				Update:&nbsp; After an uneasy day thinking about this situation at work, I came home and found the little rascal running around, hyper as always.&nbsp; Girlfriend had brought him home from the vet, and after a bit of closer inspection, the vet thinks he will be able to make a near-perfect recovery!&nbsp; His eye is still in pretty bad shape, quite a large gash straight across it and a pretty nasty discharge coming from it :o<br /><br />They cleaned it as best they could, gave some antibiotics, and we now have some medication to give him as well as some painkillers for the next week or so until the next checkup.&nbsp; It&#039;s still likely that he&#039;ll end up losing the eye, but at least he&#039;s still with us!&nbsp; Not sure if it&#039;s the painkillers they gave him, but he sure is extremely happy and excited at the moment, lol...<br /><br />Thanks for the kind and supportive words everyone, it really helped get through today at work.

				Good to hear he&#039;s home and doing well.<br />It&#039;s still a possibility he&#039;ll lose vision in the eye if he hasn&#039;t already, and they may recommend an enucleation of the eye if it gets too bad.<br /><br />sdesu

				I hope all goes well slybootz. I had a cat for 15 years, and when I had to put her down, it was not easy. Some people don&#039;t understand the reality and mechanics of bonding with a pet, but It can be like losing a friend.

				This is sad dude :( i have two cats myself and i will be really sad if i have to put one of them to sleep.. but if the poor animal is suffering i think this is the good thing to do, you can always adopt another lovely cat&nbsp; ;) i have adopted my second cat in a refuge because i wanted an adult cat, baby cat are cute but they are too energetic for me and they cause some trouble sometimes until they grow up a little.
