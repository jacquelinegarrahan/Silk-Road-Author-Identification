				I&#039;ve been waiting for a drop - at least a small one. Last time coins hit around $15 USD per coin, the same thing happened.<br /><br />If you were sitting on a small pile of coins and you needed to cash out, wouldn&#039;t you wait until the market price climbed a bit? I would. The market will recover like any market, but now is a good time to buy!

Paradoxically, their &#039;behind the scenes&#039; attempts to impede BTC markets by pressuring banks is resulting in BTC value gains and making BTC investors very wealthy.<br />

				There is always (almost) a flow of coins at my control. I usually throw some here and some there for fun.<br /><br />When the market reached that $15 high a couple months ago, I was able to cash out quick. Most the coins I was hold was from a $6.50 high in the middle of June. I dumped a bunch at $14 and damn year doubled up.<br /><br />when you are talking a couple thousands coins....it adds up quick.<br />

				Its like holding silver, gold, ammunition etc., everything has its up and downs- what I have figured out with any of the above, regardless what happens in the markets, if you hold a solid number of any of the above or all- you will stay pretty good monetarily ;) <br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br /><br /><br />Made FRNs in 2008-09 selling extra ammo, made FRNs in 2006-2010 selling/ buying silver and gold, and have made money using bitcoins for buying and selling those items the state hates. ;0 <br /><br /><br />Ahoy mateys, ye see the skull n bones, i see&#039;s the broad strokes of profit.
