				Over the past few weeks, I have been putting various keyloggers onto systems with no protection. It has been fairly unsuccessful, as all I had managed to get was some facebook details and such, but I have just got the Debit card details from a person with no protection at all, and as far as I am aware is fairly old and inable to use a computer well. They put their card details onto Amazon, which doesn&#039;t require a CVC code, which means that I can&#039;t exactly do much with the card. But I am able to use the card on amazon though, so here&#039;s my question;<br />&nbsp; -How am I able to use this card? Is there a way to anonymously buy items through amazon?(Set up with false details on tor), I do not have a PO Box, So would have to get it sent to mine or a friends house.<br />&nbsp; -If not, is there a way I can use this card on another site to get money from it? I haven&#039;t found any websites that don&#039;t require a CVC code, and the keylogger no longer works so I can&#039;t carry on monitoring to get the CVC...<br /><br />Any advice would be great, as far as I am aware she is fairly old, so would not likely to have much knowledge of small payments,<br />Cheers,<br />Locker.
