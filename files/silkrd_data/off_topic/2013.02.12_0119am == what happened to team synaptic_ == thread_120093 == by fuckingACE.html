				I read through many posts from Team synaptic. .&nbsp; .<br /><br />He was a master of scamming teen boys.&nbsp; Teen boys looking for a gun always fell for his tactics.&nbsp; He got them to FE, send money in otherways, get them to send even more money (jeese) lost orders, lost coins, excuses. . . boy. . it was no wonder they closed the armoury-&nbsp; it was a honeypot for attracting teen boys looking for a gun.&nbsp; Desperate to get one, they threw money at this guy to get a gun. . . . in some ways he made off with a lot of money that he didn&#039;t have to work too hard to get.<br /><br />The NEWBIES section of this forum is a setup too.&nbsp; Its a target for scammers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Put all the newbies in the daycare and leave the door unlocked. .&nbsp; jeese. .&nbsp; easy to con others when you know where all the beginers are located and they are desperate to make their first purchase at any cost. .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . .&nbsp; &nbsp; Some moderators are even charging bitcoins to help others out.&nbsp; They make things complicated for them and set them up to ask questions.&nbsp; Then, they have to pay to have their questions answered. .. hahaahaha newbies section is easy selling spot for answers for bitcoins.<br /><br />Just my rant and observations. <br /><br />

				This is the scammer you keep refurringg to:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/f9a7bbe59f<br />That is synaptic who is a huge scammer that for some reason is still on the road. For example he has a lottery for 1000$ that with SR fee&#039;s he gets 900$ for.<br /><br />How can this person create an account with the same name as that old scammer. <br />And ace he was a scammer, lost some money to him myself.<br /><br />Chaos
