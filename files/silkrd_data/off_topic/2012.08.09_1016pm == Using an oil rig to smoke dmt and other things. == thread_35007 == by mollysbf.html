				I have a nice quartz oil swing for my bong. Hopefully there are some smokers big enough to know what it is on here. Anyway it&#039;s the puddle swing version so you torch the quartz puddle then rotate it under the dome and stir with a rod while inhaling the vapor. I bought a meth pipe to smoke dmt and I just can&#039;t get it to give me massive hits. I was wondering if throwing dmt would work on my oil rig or if I would be getting it to hot and possibly burn it or would taking the bong rip of pure dmt vapor hurt to much.

				If you&#039;re using a torch, it&#039;ll probably be too hot. But you can always try it with a lower dose and if it works then you can try it without fear of wasting a lot of it.

				very true. the quartz cools quickly so maybe I can just wait for it to not be red hot anymore then drop it on. or someone could help with my shit pipe method.

				Letting it cool would definitely help, I&#039;d be interested to hear how that works but I&#039;d understand if you don&#039;t want to potentially waste DMT.

				this is something i&#039;ve been very interested in. i have a rig with a titanium skillet and i&#039;ve been wondering about smoking crack or maybe deemsters on it. <br /><br />seems like things could get a bit runny...

				idk if I would recommend with the titanium skillet or nail because of leakage. The best would be to have the noodle one made of quartz...no worries about puddles running there. I don&#039;t mind wasting it a bit. I feel it&#039;s the most underpriced drug on the market....including IRL. Nothing like a good blast off.
