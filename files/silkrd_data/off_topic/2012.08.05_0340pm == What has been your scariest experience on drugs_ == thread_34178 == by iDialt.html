				Basically the title, I&#039;ll start it off my writing mine! :P<br /><br />My scariest experience would be when I took a walk down to my local market and bought 1 &#039;Benzo Fury&#039; legal high pill and 3 grams of &#039;Black Mamba&#039; legal weed and 1 &#039;Blueberry Burst&#039; flavored blunt wrap. The plan was to save the pill for a New Year as it was the 24th of December when i bought them but I went home and waited till about 11pm and decided fuck it, I&#039;m taking it now. I waited an hour for it took take effect, nothing. Merry-fucking-Ripoffmas.<br /><br />&nbsp;I then glanced over to see my Mamba and the blunt wrap and thought since this pill was a waste I may as well toke up. Being the second time I had taken Mamba, I hadn&#039;t realized how it grabs you by the balls and smashes you against your walls if you smoke too much. I put about 2.5ish grams into the blunt, rolled it, licked it, and sparked it. Within a couple puffs I could already feel it kicking in, where you get the lightheaded and the giggles and pretty much good feelings. <br /><br />After I had powered through the blunt, I stumbled back into my room and turned the lights off and turned on &#039;I feel like dying- Lil Wayne&#039; (Big mistake!) I started contemplating who I was and believed my life was like &#039;The Truman Show&#039; and thought everybody could see me, and was watching me, extreme paranoia washed over me. This continued on for about 30 minutes which seems like a lifetime when utterly mongo&#039;ed!<br /><br />&nbsp;My vision seemed to have a 3 second delay and a strobe effect which is quite hard to explain unless you have been in this state before! I then made my way out of my room and into the kitchen so I could get rid of the cotton-mouth where something clicked in my brain and convinced me that I was breaking into a strangers home which resulted in my creeping around my house like I was in the game &#039;Metal Gear Solid&#039;, Very fucked up. For the rest of the night I hid myself under my covers and waited for soberness to arrive.<br /><br />-iDialt. :)

				Either the first time I tried am-2201 or the time I took 50mg 2c-t-7 with 3mg 25i-nbome. That trip was just so far out there I was convinced I was jesus... the am-2201 was just euphoric yet made me very anxious, confused and terrified. I came to like other synthetic cannabinoids though.

				In no particular order...<br /><br />1) The very first time I did shrooms. I had no concept of tripping, and my girlfriend at the time assured me, &quot;it&#039;s like weed, but colors shift and stuff.&quot; I was so scared and unprepared I almost killed myself. Found a happy place and called a close friend to babysit me.<br /><br />2) One time I overdosed on heroin. Intense puking, labored breathing, difficulty walking, and a bunch of other nasty effects. Thought I was going to die.<br /><br />3) One time I smoked weed in my 100+ degree trailer, drinking energy drinks. Obviously it wasn&#039;t just the weed that did it, but I lost sight and sound, called 911, and crawled to the door and managed to get outside. One word: Dumbass.

				Shrooms for me to, first time i done them i had no real concept of the effects, id researched and brought some from my local head shop, went way over bored and thought id fucked myself mentally, slept the hardest iv ever done before and woke up felling brilliant. I still under dose myself now though, id rather take too little and top up than go ballistic.

				I remember at camping I had bought a gram of mephedrone and was giving people lines and my friend hadn&#039;t touched it before and as I was ruined, I told him that I would make a small line for him and a big one for me, I made the big one first and by accident gave it to him and up his nose it went! He had so much energy but couldn&#039;t control it and he had to get someone to hold his stomach because he said his &quot;insides were going to fall out!&quot; haha! After that he was fine and wired!

				on a recent camping trip we hired a Forrest and stayed in a huge teepee, the owner was obviously into psychedelics and had drawn some amazing images on the outside of the teepee, when we were at our peak we sat inside and when the sun came through it gave us the most amazing visuals, snakes, birds, flowers all fully animated, one of the best experiences iv had,id recommend it to anybody.

				I don&#039;t mind camping with a load of people and drinking and having a good time but as soon as it gets to about 11pm-ish and It starts to get cold, the fire turns to shit since everybody is wasted and forgets about it, I usually find a way home and fuck the actual camping part of camping!

The plan was to save the pill for a New Year as it was the 24th of December when i bought them but I went home and waited till about 11pm and decided fuck it, I&#039;m taking it now. I waited an hour for it took take effect, nothing. Merry-fucking-Ripoffmas.<br /><br />&nbsp;I then glanced over to see my Mamba and the blunt wrap and thought since this pill was a waste I may as well toke up. Being the second time I had taken Mamba, I hadn&#039;t realized how it grabs you by the balls and smashes you against your walls if you smoke too much. I put about 2.5ish grams into the blunt, rolled it, licked it, and sparked it. Within a couple puffs I could already feel it kicking in, where you get the lightheaded and the giggles and pretty much good feelings. <br /><br />After I had powered through the blunt, I stumbled back into my room and turned the lights off and turned on &#039;I feel like dying- Lil Wayne&#039; (Big mistake!) I started contemplating who I was and believed my life was like &#039;The Truman Show&#039; and thought everybody could see me, and was watching me, extreme paranoia washed over me. This continued on for about 30 minutes which seems like a lifetime when utterly mongo&#039;ed!<br /><br />&nbsp;My vision seemed to have a 3 second delay and a strobe effect which is quite hard to explain unless you have been in this state before! I then made my way out of my room and into the kitchen so I could get rid of the cotton-mouth where something clicked in my brain and convinced me that I was breaking into a strangers home which resulted in my creeping around my house like I was in the game &#039;Metal Gear Solid&#039;, Very fucked up. For the rest of the night I hid myself under my covers and waited for soberness to arrive.<br /><br />-iDialt. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Isn&#039;t it ironic how legal highs can often have much more adverse side effects than their illicit counterparts? <br /><br />It&#039;s bonkers!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I fortunately, haven&#039;t had an experience nowhere near as bad as yours! <br /><br />Just getting greedy, overdosing, and going a bit crazy!<br /><br />Once, shamefully, I did an eighth of shitty street coke in a line, yes I know, that&#039;s pretty bad!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />It hit me HARD and fast, I collapsed and couldn&#039;t get up afterwards, cowered in a corner, shaking my ass off, for about an hour, then I was violently sick! <br /><br />Serves me right for pushing my limits way beyond the line, no pun intended!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />It took me 24 hours to fully recover! Never again, I&#039;ll limit myself to acceptable sized lines and enjoy it!<br /><br />Lesson learnt, you can have too much of a good thing too soon!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />How long did it take you to make a full recovery iDialt?

				1.) LSD. Thought I was dead and stuck in a time-loop. The same thing kept repeating itself over and over, seemingly without end. I thought I was in hell and destined to relive the same moment for eternity. <br /><br />2.) Mushrooms. Same thing, and delirium. The trip felt like it lasted for years.

				One night I rectally administered a gram of methylone ( I had previously that day taken about half a gram orally, and the past few days I had taken about .2 or .3 a night, and was noticing increasingly diminished effects, so I decided to go for gold ) and anxiety struck me as I realized how much that was. I don&#039;t know whether it was the fact that I was nervous making it so bad, or the actual drug, but all of a sudden my heart was seizing up and I had a lot of hypertension and my BPM was ( i couldn&#039;t count it very good &#039;cause it was so high ) was probably 180 - 200+ (I remember it was at least 5 beats a second) and I started to freak out. All I could do was sit at my computer and masturbate. The past few nights I had done methylone alone and was having a good time as I usually did, although not being around people forced me to facebook to talk with a bunch of people at once which made me happy. But as time went on I noticed the empathy was going down and all that was left was stimulation. By the time I took the gram I was feeling nothing but really anxious stimulation, almost like stimulation from ephedrine.<br /><br />But anyway - I was sitting at my computer and (being high for about 4 days straight now, with very little sleep, maybe 1 - 1.5 hours a night ) I noticed the shadows on my walls making patterns and slowly morphing into people. The shadows of chairs and wardrobes formed into distinct silhouettes of people I didn&#039;t know and I could hear them whispering. I didn&#039;t know what they were whispering about but I assumed it had something to do with me. I recognized this as a symptom of a stimulant induced psychotic episode, as I consider myself quite familiar with drugs and their effects ( although that didn&#039;t stop me from nearly OD&#039;ing on &#039;em ) and tried to calm myself down but eventually I just became a babbling mess, trying to talk with these shadows in my room at 3 A.M.. <br /><br />I decided that I needed to lay down. I laid down on my bed, and tried to fall asleep, but every time I closed my eyes I was haunted by horrible visions. People I know and love dying, and the like. At one point a giant flying millipede with razorblades and other assorted weapons instead of arms flew inside of me but didn&#039;t hurt me. It just sorta phased through me.<br /><br />At that point I realized I was probably either dying or having an out of body experience, so I focused on trying to astral project myself to different places. But I couldn&#039;t control where I was going.<br /><br />I went to my dorm room in college and the place was dilapidated and covered in blood and my roommate was lying dead so I opened my eyes. When I closed them again it was as if I could see everything in my bedroom, without having my eyes open. Like a third-eye opening sort of deal. I even got up to test if it was right and I was surprised to find that everything was the exact place it was in my minds eye.<br /><br />All in all, it was a very fearful experience, lasting probably 8 or 10 hours for the residual stimulation to depart in which time I could go to sleep. I notice now that I see a lot more floaters in my eyes, I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s because of the drugs or because I didn&#039;t notice all of them before. However, I don&#039;t regret the experience. I learned a lot about myself by examining myself as I thought I was going to die and all that. It was rewarding as well as terrifying. I don&#039;t think I did any long term damage to my system, but I don&#039;t know. Soon after that experience I began noticing tingling feelings in my legs, and went to the neurologist and figured out that I had restless leg syndrome. I&#039;m diabetic, so this sorta makes sense, but I don&#039;t know whether the strain on my system from all the methylone exacerbated already existing neuropathy or created new neuropathy altogether.

				A few years ago I decided to experiment with a massive amount of Cubensis. I didn&#039;t even know how much, but I&#039;m thinking 5 to 5.5 grams.

				having a house party during the &#039;drone craze of &#039;10/&#039;11 and literally seing a guy have&nbsp; afull blown anxiety attack because he had no more &#039;drone and was coming down like a motherfucker.<br /><br />was about 3pm on the sunday, we&#039;d been partying like a motherfucker since friday and were a little scatty due to no sleep but this guy had gatecrashed the party and never left, aparently he&#039;d been seshing since tues/weds and not slept. within 20 mins of his last line, his head crashed into his knees where it didnt move for the next hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;towards the end of that hour, the guy starts breathing stupidly heavy, looked like he was heaving or puking. starts making these strange whimpering noises and stands up. EYES OPEN clutching at his chest making muffled strangled sounds, obviously when the party casualty (a gatecrasher whos friends had already left) starts showing signs of distress you try sort it out, but because nobody knew this lad, i think people over-amped their concern and everybody asking him, &#039;you alright?&#039; must have really freaked him out because he started thrashing his arms out at nothing or nobody. <br /><br />managed to get him upstairs to my room, put him in my bed (room was at top of the house, dark, quiet &amp; cool) got him a biiiig glass of pure OJ and told him to rest, keep hydrated and to try n relax. after about 4 hours he managed to sort himself out, got him a cab and i never saw him again in my life.<br /><br />what happened while we let a complete stranger KO in my room?<br /><br />smashed out the Regretamine :D

				Never had a really bad experience personally despite some heroic dosing and mixing of substances.<br /><br />I bought some Ecstasy in a techno club from a trusted dealer once, I double dropped and it turned out to be a pretty big dose of ketamine (for someone who had never used it). I ended up getting taken behind the scenes in the club with a friend thanks to the nice security guys, I sat on the stairs feeling like I was made of plastic and melting into the stairs, couldn&#039;t even stand up. Was kind of nice and fun tho after I clocked onto it being ketamine.<br /><br /><br />

				Funny shit, this is mine.<br /><br />1. Scariest.. smoked a bong bowl of 80x purple sticky salvia, after i cleared the binger, i handed the bong and lighter and fell into a dark pit. The most intense colorful animations of a cartoon world in my mind. I jumped through a bunch of different scenes/events in my mind as if i were in some scroogish christmas nightmare. It seemed the whole world was held together by my finger tip and at the end of the 30 minute trip i was just a free floating spirit thought that didn&#039;t know what or who i was. then i took a bong rip of nugget and went to bed. after that i tripped in my sleep for the rest of the night.<br /><br />2. One time, my senior year in high school, i ended upwards of 13 thizzle pills and did a bunch of coke and drank hella. At around 3am, i was at my buddies party and i managed to sit myself down in the shower with all my clothes on (shoes, snowboarding jacket etc).. i swear it was the most euphoric shower i&#039;ve ever had, literally just like sitting on a beach, anyways, a different buddy called a cab. I eventually got out of the shower/bathtub soaking wet and jumped in the cab. I was rollin my face off, soaking wet, sitting in a cab with no money. The cabbie turned around and asked me if there was anyone else, i promptly replied no and we took off for town. As we pulled into town ten minutes later, the cabbie had to turn around and go back and get the rest of my couple friends. all that wasn&#039;t that bad but, that morning was scary as shit. I tried to sleep, didn&#039;t work. tried to warm up, didn&#039;t work. my heart felt like it wasn&#039;t going to stop i just laid in my buddies mom&#039;s bed and shivered the whole night. got up at 9am, railed a line of yayo and biked home :)<br /><br />3. I&#039;ve had numerous bad mushroom trips, probably 5-6 weighing in at different intensities.. from just freaking out to almost offing myself.. shit&#039;s a trip, fuck that shit.<br /><br />4. On my 21st, my buddy blew me down some yayo and then dosed me some lucy in my drink that he bought me.. kinda scary shit when you don&#039;t know you&#039;ve been messed with. overall, kinda lame night, but got fucked up.<br /><br />5. I&#039;ve smoked all kinds of synthetic herbage, but this summer i smoked some shit called dragon&#039;s breath or something... i hadn&#039;t smoked weed for like 4-5 months at this point and wanted to get super ripped outta my skull so i rolled up 3 fat ass doobies, i got half way through one and i thought to myself damn i&#039;m really stoned... then five minutes later my heart rate went up two fold, my vision got all mushie near vision shit goin, i felt like i was gonna have a panic attack and my head felt like my shit was gettin railed by a bunch of semi trucks.<br /><br />6. Doin a bunch of blow, then driving around is one of the scariest shits for me too. I swear i sketch about everyone. Last week I went to a rave, brought up a ball of mdma, some herb and some addy. Anyways, I made like 45 bucks from selling a few points, then bought a few pressies. One of the was actually from SuperTrips. That red Q thing was Bomb as fuck, it was the last pressy i took the morning after at 7am. Hiked up to a ridgeline, took a shot of whiskey, for the sunrise, then ended up puking and rollin even harder. After a few hours, decided to leave the rave, so i got sketched out and ate my last 2-300mg of mdma. i threw my pipe in a coffee cup and burned my molly bag. we decided to stop at a beach on the river and i got sketched out by the family of 4(mom dad and 2 kids) and had to leave cause i was rollin so hard.

				Hmm, not a simple one. Reflecting on all the bad experiences I&#039;ve had, they got one thing in common: They all arose from that same fatalistic state of mind, you know, where you do moronic things against better judgement...the drugs themselves have never let me down ;-)...<br />Let&#039;s see (leaving out my stories involving psychedelics ;-): There was a time when I was struggling with insomnia and happened to have some H lying around and thought (actually, it prolly didn&#039;t involve a whole lot of that ;-) it was a good idea to regard it as a sleep aid and dose accordingly (heroically, that is). Well, the end of that story was my roommate being torn from his sleep by me running into the toilet door. Though I still somehow managed to keep a firm grip on the foil while crawling back to bed and later even came up with a half-assed story as to what the fuck I was doing there ^^.<br />Another time there was nothing around but etizolam (oh, the irony) but, you guessed it, a certain moron felt like squeezing some chemical euphoria out of that, too. I&#039;ll spare you the details of what must have been a very awkward and embarrassing benzo blackout. Today I realise that the only good thing about benzo ODs is that you won&#039;t remember shit unless somebody told you what happened (and that&#039;s the catch, there were plenty of people around unfortunately ^^). Damn, I sure want this to remain the one and only time that I screwed up like that...

				I&#039;m still new to this whole drug thing so I&#039;m taking baby steps. Had my first hash brownie, 1/4 of a brownie that is, it was good. Next day I had the other 3/4..too much too soon. When I closed my eyes it felt like I wouldn&#039;t be able to open them again because apparently I ceased to exist, and when I did open them I was very disoriented. I had to focus to tell if I was breathing or not. It felt like I was someone else looking at my arms and legs. I also learned that trance, and NOT death metal is a better listening choice. I was able to stay calm, however, and came up with some excellent story ideas, but I&#039;m not eating that much again.

My latest experiment was fasting and meditating for a day, no food for 24 hours, then I ate a pan of brownies and ripped bong hits until the brownies kicked in. There&#039;s a point where a trip is so intense that it&#039;s not even bad anymore, and I can honestly say that it was comparable to LSD or shrooms. Crazy stuff man, I love it&nbsp; :)

It seemed to me like the only escape. Thankfully my mom eventually found me, but if no one found me I might easily have killed myself.&nbsp; When you have experienced a trip as bad as the ones I have had, it doesn&#039;t strike you as absurd when you hear &quot;urban legends&quot; about people having committed suicide while tripping. Such stories seem very plausible to me. It should be noted that I also have a mental illness, so I don&#039;t blame LSD itself for it, but in my case, I blame the interaction between LSD, schizophrenia, and a very bad setting.<br /><br />I know of several other cases. One is the man who jumped out of his window in the 1950s while under the influence of LSD. He was a victim of MKULTRA. He didn&#039;t know he had ingested LSD. He thought he was going insane. And this isn&#039;t an urban legend. It&#039;s well documented. Another case I have read of is a girl who committed suicide in the 70s or 80s under the influence of LSD. I don&#039;t remember who she was, but I remember seeing her father argue with Timothy Leary about it on TV. (I know of one more case, but it won&#039;t help you because it is anecdotal. It&#039;s someone I know personally.)<br /><br />While I would never blame LSD for it, it is obvious that people with a pre-existing mental condition, or people who have been given LSD without their knowledge, could easily kill themselves under the influence of the drug. LSD can be dangerous in the wrong setting and psychological state.

I did think that the only way out was to kill myself. As if i had gotten stuck in an alternate reality.<br /><br />Thankfully i&#039;m pretty chill, so I never acted on it.<br /><br />But it was scary. I started thinking my life was a lie. Like I played this act (everyone plays an act, duh!). It was crazy self reflection, really. when I got home I took a benzo to knock me out because I was still freaking out. I woke up totally different and felt, the best way I can explain it, is damaged.<br /><br />Of course, recently I find out that you shouldn&#039;t take a benzo to exit ego death, you should just let it pass. <br /><br />I tried dosing acid a few times after that and it was never the same. too much fear, and not enough loathing, if you catch my drift.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />Understanding that I went through an ego death, I may be more willing to try some shrooms in the future. But i&#039;m in no hurry :)
