				In the southern provinces,&nbsp; Limburg, Noord-Brabant and Zeeland, the new law applies since 1st of May 2012. In the rest of the country, including Amsterdam, it is planned to go into effect 1st of January 2013. The law makes it illegal for coffeeshops to sell to persons without a Dutch ID and a copy of the city records that states his address. When you have showed that you become a member and get a membership card/item and you can use that together with your ID for future purchases. <br /><br />That is the plan, but we have to see if they will follow through with all this. Because 12 September there are elections and it is likely the political landscape changes. And in the areas where it is in effect already it isn&#039;t a definite success.<br /><br />&nbsp;In Maastricht the first day the law applied 38 of the 39 coffeeshops closed because only 100 persons became member at one shop. 390 people were fired because of it, and since then illegal trade exploded. Smokers just didn&#039;t feel comfortable registering themselves to buy some weed. And especially Amsterdam would suffer considerably on the economy, as did Maastricht.

				&nbsp;Seeing how chill everyone is about smoking weed there I bet that even if they enforced that law, a tourist can easily just ask a local resident to buy it for them.

				What the fuck happened? <br /><br />Can any of you Dutch shed some light on this..<br /><br />Did some morons get baked and drown in the canal? Or are you just tired of all the English tourists? <br /><br />Way to kill off your tourist trade. I suppose it&#039;s a good thing you&#039;ve still got the hookers. As soon as you get rid of them all you&#039;ll have left is the architecture and the cool flag, and who the fuck ever went to Amsterdam for that? ;) Actually, I&#039;m pretty sure we all went to the dam to &quot;admire the architecture&quot;.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that Prague is becoming the new Dam anyway. Weed is still illegal for foreigners but the Czech mentality is very laid back from what I hear.. only a matter of time before they realise they&#039;re sitting on a gold mine and make it a full industry.<br /><br />

Of course the politicians in their ivory tower don&#039;t realize that the people will still go to Holland to buy it, only illegally from kiddo&#039;s on the street, and in this way making the purchase AND the use (because there is no quality control on the streets) more dangerous.. The weedpass is already required in some parts (southern) of Holland and a massive increase of street violence and disturbances is noticeable.<br /><br />Today there are elections for the parliament and there will probably a coalition between 3 parties, one of them have the canceling of the weedpass in their election program... Soooo you all just have to wait and see what happens, for now the weedpass will still go into activation nationwide at Jan 1 2013.

				It really sounds like a plan for a monopoly and to try to increase their population but not really because how many coffee shops do they have? Couldn&#039;t each one have a full membership with the size of the population already?

				Well, the elections don&#039;t appear to have a positive effect, allthough a government hasn&#039;t been formed jet, so nothing is certain. But the party to which the person that came up with this bad plan belongs has become the biggest party off all, and a new record for the party itself.&nbsp; There is some resistance by local politicians, because it&#039;s not working. Every honest analysis will confirm that. And the warlock that concevied this knew it also I suppose, he just isn&#039;t telling his real motives.

				News article in the media today <br /><br />ALMOST TWO million tourists who visit Amsterdam every year to consume cannabis in its famous “coffee shops” will still be able to get stoned legally after January next, despite fears that a controversial new ban would exclude foreigners.<br /><br />Although the ban will still come into effect across the Netherlands in the new year, the new Liberal-Labour Party coalition government has given local councils the power to opt out – and the mayor of Amsterdam, Eberhard van der Laan, says the city’s 220 cannabis cafes will remain open to everyone.<br /><br />The tighter regulations were proposed by the Liberal-Christian Democrat coalition that lost power last April, and the new opt- out clause is part of a wider rethink that will substantially relax plans to turn the coffee shops into private members’ clubs open to Dutch residents only.<br /><br />The rethink will also abandon the hugely unpopular requirement that even Dutch users of the cafes would have to register for a wietpas or “weed pass”, which customers maintained was an unacceptable invasion of their privacy and coffee shop owners said would ruin their businesses.<br /><br />However, the new government says customers will have to be able to present evidence of age to prevent sales to minors, and it is to go ahead with a plan to place a maximum limit on the level of THC – tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient in cannabis – in the drugs on sale. A ban on so-called “drugs tourists” was introduced on a trial basis in the south of the country on January 1st last in response to complaints about public nuisance – but a recent report by Maastricht university said one result of this had been a noticeable increase in street dealing, including to young teenagers.<br /><br />Mr van der Laan, a consistent critic of the proposed ban, has welcomed the opt-out.<br /><br />“A ban would have undone all the good work that has been achieved in recent years. We would have seen more robberies, more arguments over fake drugs, and less quality control – all the old problems would have come back.”<br /><br />Other cities such as Rotterdam and Haarlem have been similarly critical – and are also expected to try to sidestep the ban.

				http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/30/dutch-amsterdam-weed-marijuana/1668761/<br /><br />This is only a partial victory <br />11:50AM EDT October 30. 2012 - <br />AMSTERDAM (AP) — The incoming Dutch government has ditched plans for a national &quot;weed pass&quot; that would have been available only to residents and that would have effectively banned tourists from Amsterdam&#039;s marijuana cafes.<br /><br />However, under a provisional governing pact unveiled this week, cities can bar foreigners from weed shops if they choose.<br /><br />The pact says that it wants only Dutch residents to have access to marijuana cafes, but leaves enforcement up to cities. Amsterdam opposes a ban, which would hurt tourism.<br /><br />Some cafe owners said Tuesday that they are satisfied Dutch weed policy will remain unchanged, while others criticized the lack of clarity.<br /><br /><br />

				they have been talkin about this for yrs and every yr now it always goes the same way, i wouldnt worry guys, at the end of the day money talks and bullshit runs the marathon, the tourist trade in amsterdam keeps the dutch economy afloat, speak to any dutch citizen about credit cards,HP, loans or mortages, none of them do it, their economy is so strong because of the tourist trade they do not have to exploit their citizens and this is why they are one of the few countries in the world that are not in debt to the elbow...<br /><br />in my opinion the dutch have their shit sorted yrs ago, its seems to me its new political parties trying to get votes by trying to pass new legistration/ideas onto the younger generation. Even if it did pass, i give 1 yr max n it would be back the same old tricks, cos theres to much infrustructure based on the sale of weed just to give up like that...<br /><br />
