				Hey guys,<br />So fuck MyBitcoin.com. It may be the latest scam. About 2 days ago I noticed some of my temp MBC accounts were way lower than before and yesterday it started 504ing. TTL expired. There are a lot of large spends on blockexplorer and I am really hoping that isn&#039;t all out money being funneled out. They are registered thru PrivacyShark. Fuck. So if you recently placed an order with me and were happy with the outcome (95% are out of 42 trans) please feel free to donate via SR User&gt;User. Also we will be posting a new item on SR to help raise funds. Rent is due the 1st and I&#039;m tripping out. Anything is appreciated and I would only post this in the most dire circumstances. I have many friends on here and I hope nobody takes this the wrong way. If you recently placed an order with me, it will still be shipped. <br /><br />We are not stopping business, as we have plenty of chocolate/hash and postage.<br /><br />*If this is not allowed here, please let me know. I wish to preserve my reputation.<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/14644<br />edit: Thanks for the kind wishes guys! We are holding in there!

				I am SOOOO Glad that I never used my online bitcoin account. about 3 weeks ago, I read that they were selective scamming over at the bitcoin forums. Just use your computers bitcoin wallet and you should be fine, I agree, I dont think that they are coming back, if they do, stay far away...

				that sucks. i didn&#039;t know it was down. i used it before, but never kept coins in there for very long.<br />it seems that keeping coins in your account at gox or tradehill is a good way to go before you send to tumbler.
