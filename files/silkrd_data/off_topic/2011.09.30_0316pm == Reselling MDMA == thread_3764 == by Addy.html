				Hello, all. I&#039;m going to buy bulk MDMA on SR, and then resell it where I live. I&#039;m in a pretty dry area, with incredibly expensive (and shitty) weed, heroin, and a few other substances. The only MDMA to speak of is from people willing to drive an excessive distance to the city, and even then, more often than not it&#039;s just pipes and other shit.<br /><br />I intend on selling it to people I&#039;m fairly close with, people who don&#039;t do it on a regular basis, and presumably they will distribute it to their friends.<br /><br />So I guess my question to you guys (for anyone that&#039;s taken MDMA before), is how much did/do you find to be the perfect amount? For those who do MDMA on a regular basis, how much did you take when you were just starting out, or at least before you built up a tolerance to it?<br /><br />I pose this question because I&#039;d like to know the best way to portion out the bags. I know 125 mg is fine for some, while others require more than 250mg... I was considering making a ton of 150mg bags and then some 50mg &quot;booster&quot; bags/caps on the side. Any ideas?<br /><br />Much appreciated,<br />Addy

				why not just sell it by the gram then?&nbsp; people i would buy molly from would sell it by the gram or capsules with 100 mg in each for 10$&nbsp; or just buy a bunch of dutch pills then sell them for 20$, i sold a Q dance for 25$ and the kid was happy to have it.&nbsp; The dutch pills are like gold.

				I think 100MG capsules for $10 is a good deal and that is what I have been doing IRL. If you live in an area with crappy rolls, people will be pretty happy. If they just have to have a Gram, just give them 10 capsules.
