				So today a bunch of me and my friends were prank calling escorts from cl and backpage. We were calling ones mostly from are middle of no where country town and the % of asians here is honestly like 1% or less. But for some reason like 60% of the escorts on backpage are asians. They dont use real pics they steal model pics you can find all over the web with a reverse image search. Also the different escorts all have the same generic message and different escorts use the same phone number which all have some creepy guy answering the phone. The 14k have a known presence in are small town they open a lot of grows in farm houses because its safer than growing in the city. If a few high school stoners can figure this out you would think the police would be able to also?

				Some cops are dumb but there are many professionals working for the police who are not dumb by any measure. Getting cocky about being more clever than the police is a fast track to prison. Prison is full of people who thought they were clever.<br /><br />NEVER give cops an attitude. <br /><br />Cops will spend years infiltrating drug circles. Look at some of the big busts and you will see that some sophisticated police work goes into it. Mostly its just dealers getting arrogant. <br /><br />As for Asians, its the same in the UK with Vietnamese, Laos and Chinese all growing weed. But there are gangs who target homes growing and in some parts of the UK the Asian gangs pulled out as they were just too obvious plus local gangs all want a piece of the action. The Asian gangs had poor illegal immigrants living in the kitchens. Every room was used for growing. If someone Asian moves in my area they will be visited 8-10 weeks later. I&#039;d rent out houses if I had some - and it would be easy to give the tenants a choice of 50% to the landlord or call the cops. <br /><br />The cops know that there are hundreds of thousands of little grows. <br /><br />Some cops develop an instinct and can sniff out a drug dealer pretty easily. Plus the police are using technology to scan number plates and car tax. there are a million excuses to pull up motorists and for non traffic cops its just a lucky dip as they nose about looking for anything naughty. We will have roadside drug tests next. Bad for potheads as we have the drug in our system at detection levels for 28 days or so.<br /><br />The cops will try to bring this place down but mainly I guess they would target dealers who leave too many clues and go for the odd big shipment which they could track and visit. Its difficult no doubt but easy for cops to simply message each dealer and try to pay in a manner which can be traced. There is an element of luck in all dealing. We have to be lucky all the time and the cops only need to get lucky once. <br /><br />To be honest there are so many dealers on the clearnet that places like this that keep out of the public eye are likely seen by most cops as discreet.<br /><br />Boasting about your criminal prowess will merely get the interest of some cop who likes a challenge.<br /><br />The cops are not stupid. <br /><br />The law is stupid.

				@ OP- The cops know who is commercially growing usually, its being able to prove it that really matters. They dont want to just go willy nilly and lose a conviction.<br /><br />The average IQ is 100, that includes all the retards out there. Of the average &quot;working public&quot; I would say the average should go up a standard deviation to around 115.<br /><br />But IQ is not the end all be all. The cops have a very huge war chest that helps them out.

				I wouldn&#039;t say they&#039;re dumb so much as amoral. When someone chooses to become a police officer they adopt a duty to uphold the laws by force, every law in all circumstances. They voluntarily surrender moral authority to the lawmakers as they are no longer capable of acting according to their personal moral consciences but rather are bound by their civic duty to act always in accordance with the law. If they feel a disparity between their own conscience and the dictation of the law, they have no choice but to betray their personal morality and enforce the arbitrary moral legislation of the state. They are either completely proud of every thing they have ever done in their entire career as an officer and have no involuntary objection to any aspect of the law because they agree with it totally (I imagine quite rare), or they live constantly with guilt and become machines operating on behalf of the faceless power that is the state. If they feel no guilt they would be amoral and thus the perfect tools to mandate an arbitrary moral order, positive law in a liberal democratic society.<br /><br />&quot;Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and natural result of an undue respect for law is, that you may see a file of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys,7 and all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars, against their wills, aye, against their common sense and consciences, which makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation of the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable<br />business in which they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what are they? Men at all?&quot;<br /><br />Henry David Thoreau

				I agree individually on average cops are pretty dumb, but collectively they are pretty damn smart especially with all the information and technology on their side not to mention the law.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t the one cop you need to worry about, but the team of them that are monitoring your every move to make a case on you.<br /><br />A few a smart by themselves, but usually they aren&#039;t on the street patrolling and get higher positions like Chief of Police or something.

				Some&nbsp; Myths about the Police.<br /><br />#1 The police exercise legitimate authority. <br /><br />The average police officer is not a legal expert; he probably knows his department protocol, but very little about the actual laws. This means his enforcement involves a great deal of bluffing, improvisation, and dishonesty. Police lie on a regular basis: “I just got a report of someone of your description committing a crime around here. Want to show me some ID?”<br /><br />This is not to say we should unthinkingly accept laws as legitimate, either. The entire judicial system protects the privileges of the wealthy and powerful. Obeying laws is not necessarily morally right—it may even be immoral. Slavery was legal, aiding escaped slaves illegal. The Nazis came to power in Germany via democratic elections and passed laws through the prescribed channels. We should aspire to the strength of conscience to do what we know is best, regardless of laws and police intimidation. <br /><br />#2 The police are ordinary workers just like us; they should be our allies<br /><br />. Unfortunately, there’s a big gap between “should be” and “are.” The role of the police is to serve the interests of the ruling class; anyone who has not had a bad experience with them is likely privileged, submissive, or both. Today’s police officers know exactly what they’re getting into when they join the force—people in uniform don’t just get cats out of trees. Yes, most take the job because of economic pressure, but needing a paycheck is no excuse for evicting families, harassing young people of color, or pepper-spraying demonstrators. Those whose consciences can be bought are everyone’s potential enemies, not allies.<br /><br />This fairy tale is more persuasive when it is couched in strategic terms: for example, “Every revolution succeeds at the moment the armed forces refuse to make war on their fellows; therefore we should focus on seducing the police to our side.” But the police are not just any workers; they’re the ones who chose to base their livelihoods upon defending the prevailing order, thus the least likely to be sympathetic to those who wish to change it. In this context, it makes more sense to oppose the police as such than to seek solidarity with them. As long as they serve their masters, they cannot be our allies; by denouncing the institution of police and demoralizing individual officers, we can encourage them to seek other livelihoods so we can one day find common cause with them. <br /><br />#3 Maybe there are some bad apples, but some police officers are good people.<br /><br />Perhaps some police officers have good intentions, but once again, insofar as they obey orders rather than their consciences, they cannot be trusted.<br /><br />There’s something to be said for understanding the systematic nature of institutions, rather than attributing every injustice to the shortcomings of individuals. Remember the story of the man who, tormented by fleas, managed to catch one between his fingers? He scrutinized it for a long time before placing it back at the spot on his neck where had he caught it.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20427.msg212636#msg212636">Quote from: souledout on April 28, 2012, 11:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Some&nbsp; Myths about the Police.<br /><br />#1 The police exercise legitimate authority. <br /><br />The average police officer is not a legal expert; he probably knows his department protocol, but very little about the actual laws. This means his enforcement involves a great deal of bluffing, improvisation, and dishonesty. Police lie on a regular basis: “I just got a report of someone of your description committing a crime around here. Want to show me some ID?”<br /><br />This is not to say we should unthinkingly accept laws as legitimate, either. The entire judicial system protects the privileges of the wealthy and powerful. Obeying laws is not necessarily morally right—it may even be immoral. Slavery was legal, aiding escaped slaves illegal. The Nazis came to power in Germany via democratic elections and passed laws through the prescribed channels. We should aspire to the strength of conscience to do what we know is best, regardless of laws and police intimidation. <br /><br />#2 The police are ordinary workers just like us; they should be our allies<br /><br />. Unfortunately, there’s a big gap between “should be” and “are.” The role of the police is to serve the interests of the ruling class; anyone who has not had a bad experience with them is likely privileged, submissive, or both. Today’s police officers know exactly what they’re getting into when they join the force—people in uniform don’t just get cats out of trees. Yes, most take the job because of economic pressure, but needing a paycheck is no excuse for evicting families, harassing young people of color, or pepper-spraying demonstrators. Those whose consciences can be bought are everyone’s potential enemies, not allies.<br /><br />This fairy tale is more persuasive when it is couched in strategic terms: for example, “Every revolution succeeds at the moment the armed forces refuse to make war on their fellows; therefore we should focus on seducing the police to our side.” But the police are not just any workers; they’re the ones who chose to base their livelihoods upon defending the prevailing order, thus the least likely to be sympathetic to those who wish to change it. In this context, it makes more sense to oppose the police as such than to seek solidarity with them. As long as they serve their masters, they cannot be our allies; by denouncing the institution of police and demoralizing individual officers, we can encourage them to seek other livelihoods so we can one day find common cause with them. <br /><br />#3 Maybe there are some bad apples, but some police officers are good people.<br /><br />Perhaps some police officers have good intentions, but once again, insofar as they obey orders rather than their consciences, they cannot be trusted.<br /><br />There’s something to be said for understanding the systematic nature of institutions, rather than attributing every injustice to the shortcomings of individuals. Remember the story of the man who, tormented by fleas, managed to catch one between his fingers? He scrutinized it for a long time before placing it back at the spot on his neck where had he caught it. His friends, confounded, inquired why on earth he would do such a thing. “That wasn’t the one that was biting me,” he explained. <br /><br />#4 Police can win any confrontation, so we shouldn’t antagonize them<br /><br />With all their weapons, equipment, and surveillance, the police can seem invincible, but this is an illusion. They are limited by all sorts of invisible constraints—bureaucracy, public opinion, communication breakdowns, an overloaded judicial system.

				I know this isn&#039;t going to make me very popular on SR, but where I live, cops are sweet as hell (with the exception of state police, and a few corrupt police departments of cities I avoid).<br /><br />Every interaction I&#039;ve had with a cop has been positive:<br /><br />-When my car ran out of gas, a cop noticed me stranded on the side of the road and helped push my car to a gas station<br /><br />-When I parked in an area clearly labeled NO PARKING like a retard and blocking a fire hydrant, instead of getting a ticket and a tow, I got a phone call telling me I needed to move my car.&nbsp; No idea how they got my phone number, but I&#039;m glad they had it and weren&#039;t dicks about it.<br /><br />-When I was drunk in my work parking lot sobering up a bit before work (I work odd hours, so this was the middle of the night) a cop knocked on my window to make sure I wasn&#039;t passed out or needed medical attention.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just lucky I guess.

When a certain parasitic fraction of that society legislates the exclusive use of force to it&#039;s own auspices.. and then proceeds on pillage and rapine with regards to rest of the society that is what we call government. A Force Monopoly. It typically starts (historically) as an outside force bent on robbery and slaughter which conquers a populace and is then slowly replaced from the inside via interbreeding and absorption by native elites who <br />take over the robbery show. THAT is history.<br />&nbsp;As long as governance is largely the product of voluntary interactions it is ORDER but not GOVERNMENT (at least in the evil sense). <br />&nbsp;The more power that accrues to a centralized authority the less responsive it becomes to it&#039;s victims/constituents. The more institutionalized its power apparatus becomes, the less transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;Thus we get what is the greatest historical source of death, evil and outright chaos ever in human history.<br /><br />&nbsp;Which is what you are playing apologist for. This is all pretty basic stuff.. you just haven&#039;t read the right books.<br /><br />&nbsp;Since you are on Silk Road.. might I suggest you take a look at DPR&#039;s signature and read some of the books that inspired the fine work of the guy you apparently approve of enough to use his site? Just a thought...<br /><br />&nbsp;Everyone here is practicing anarchy.. but some are too ignorant and/or hypocritical to call it that.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Protip: They aren&#039;t your friends. They aren&#039;t your allies. You are getting fucked.. but you aren&#039;t getting off.
