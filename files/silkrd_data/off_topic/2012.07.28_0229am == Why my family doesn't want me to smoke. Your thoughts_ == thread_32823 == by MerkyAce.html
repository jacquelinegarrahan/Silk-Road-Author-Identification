				I&#039;ve only just started smoking weed, because I&#039;ve just quit smoking baccy, but not really sure what to think. My mum, who is on her own with me still living with her, just found out i smoked. She&#039;s pissed because of some of the things that it has caused in our family. <br /><br />When I was 6, my dad left me and my mum because she wouldn&#039;t let him smoke weed, so he left for Thailand to get baked day after day. A year later he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, which when mixed with weed made him extremely ill mentally, sending him into a mental hospital where he died 18 months later (death unrelated). <br /><br />At 14, my cousin (on my dad&#039;s half, who was only 21 at the time) was sent into a mental hospital, diagnosed with schizophrenia. before this night he had shown no signs of it. His mum was an alcoholic, used to despise of him and had treated him terribly all his life, so to relieve some stress he decided to get baked. The weed had brought out the schizophrenia and he started hearing voices in his head telling him to kill his mum, later that night he stabbed my auntie 7 times to death, and called an ambulance shortly after. He would have been sent down for life, but because of the schizophrenia he was instead sent to a mental home.<br />After 4 years in there, he was released last year - he is on daily medication, and as long as he takes that he is fine, we have forgiven him and know it wasn&#039;t his fault.<br /><br />I get why my Mum is worried, Mental problems (Mainly schizophrenia) are in the family, but wouldn&#039;t these show if I did have it?<br />What do you all think about this, should I just smoke in private?

				I think you should listed to your mom and stay away from it completely, for ever. Never know..<br />I dont think theres a way to proove whether you are prone to schizophrenia in advance? Think it (or other things) can come out in different ways any time, maybe not now but in 10 years in some way? Iv no idea tho I may be wrong; Im just some stupid kid..<br /><br />If you smoke cannabis you are still prone to many airway illnesses, cancer (?) etc. cos of the smoke.. ure lungs/airways didnt get to heal properly, better stay away from all smoking, if you absolutely insist on using cannabis- eat it instead, but I think you should stay away from Cannabis alltogether (and all other drugs aswell?)-- especcialy as you may be prone to mental illness.. <br />just my .2, hope ya&#039;ll do well and good luck with whatever you choose<br />

				That family history is far too concerning for me to condone you taking any type of mind altering substance. Drugs aren&#039;t for you kid and there are bright neon signs right in front of your eyes saying so.<br /><br />Take up tennis or something. Your mum will love you for it. Schizophrenia and drugs do not mix well.

				Yes from what I have read, the likelihood of weed causing schizophrenia has a strong genetic component. And the thing is, you could have it and be unaware: one of the bad things about it is that a sufferer has little insight into his condition, hence believing that hallucinations and delusions of persecution etc. are real.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two brothers I know have a schizophrenic mother. One is fine, the other has at various times developed full on paranoid delusions after smoking weed, causing him to attack freinds. I personally would not like those odds!

As for your cousin... sorry but I do not believe that cannabis drove him to kill his mother. I`m not saying he killed her with full intentions, but I definitely don`t think cannabis drove him to do so. <br /><br />You should consult a doctor dealing with these special cases and research about the correlation of cannabis and schizophrenia.

				I don&#039;t think the schizophrenia necessarily breaks out when you use cannabis for the first time. It could happen later, too. It&#039;s more likely to happen with sativa strains I think, as the THC:CBD ratio is different than in indica strains. CBD (Cannabidiol) is an anti-psychotic which can actually help against schizophrenia. The THC can cause anxiety, panic, depersonalization etc.&nbsp; CBD counteracts these effects. So instead of &quot;just smoking some dank weed&quot; you may want to specifically look for strains with high CBD content, to reduce the probability of unwanted side-effects.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Leweke et al. performed a double blind, 4 week, explorative controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of purified cannabidiol and the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride on improving the symptoms of schizophrenia in 42 patients with acute paranoid schizophrenia. Both treatments were associated with a significant decrease of psychotic symptoms after 2 and 4 weeks as assessed by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. While there was no statistical difference between the two treatment groups, cannabidiol induced significantly fewer side effects </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol

				If you have a family history of mental illness and are at some point in your life going to become schizophrenic, smoking marijuana can significantly lower the age of onset.

				I got a load of personal experience with schizophrenia, even if our current medicine can describe what happens to you, the reason is still unknown.<br /><br />What is proofed by statistic, is that when you have parents with mental illness, you as a son have more than double the chance to get shizophrenia, depression or any other kind of mental illness (that is what a doctor would probably tell you). Smoking weed or doing any kind of drug (including alcohol) can faster you psychic illness, even if no one can ever tell you, that you will guaranteed be inflicted. In some cases even some hard emotional events can cause schizophrenia (girlfriend left you, shocked by car accident, smth like that). You should also avoid smoking weed, when you are under deep emotional feelings.<br /><br />At the end we all can get it one day, but you have a real higher chance.

				I have personally witnessed a potent sativa (Green Crack) push a person with history of bipolar illness into a full-on manic phase for months. Of course there are always going to be other variables but I was close with this person and I think the sativa weed was the greatest catalyst in furthering their mental illness, granted they were puffing like a train, nearly all day every day for weeks.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Many people underestimate weed.

				I see my avatar is still relevant.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Honestly, the whole &quot;weed sends you mad&quot; thing is so fucking overblown it makes me want to puke.&nbsp; The prohibs have been backed into a corner on every other part of their farcical argument, and have retreated to this: that weed may trigger an episode in those already predisposed.&nbsp; And by may, I mean a slightly increased chance, much less than alcohol, for example, or simply emotional traumas such as a relationship breakup or argument, like an earlier poster mentioned.&nbsp; Weed is a relatively minor trigger in comparison,.<br /><br />Much has been made of the prevalence of weed use amongst schizophrenics, depressives, and other assorted crazy types, with the suggestion that weed is the cause of these issues.&nbsp; The problem with that is that correlation does not equal causation, and the real reason that weed is more prevalent amongst people with mental issues is that it helps to alleviate or quieten many of the sufferer&#039;s symptoms.&nbsp; &quot;Normal&quot; people use weed to get high, but us crazy people use it as medicine.

				As both an early teens starter in smoking weed and a sufferer from schitzophenia, while also being as much as a doubter in ANY statement made outside of a scientific bulletin, I find the notion that THC doesn&#039;t in some form, miniscule or exponential, affect the possibility of a mental disorder development occuring happening.<br /><br />This is based on several extremely sound theories but for now I&#039;ll just keep the most easily acceptable - Weed makes your thought process race out of control and breaks down various barriers where &quot;common sense&quot; comes into factor.<br /><br />I could go into so many sound discussions to clarify what that means but I&#039;m tired so I&#039;ll make it a very plain (but easy to argue against) explanation so at least I&#039;ve got something to come back to tomorrow morning :D<br /><br />THC is an extremely unique drug. It makes the brain work in an almost &#039;perfect&#039; way in the sense that it fires up creativeness, decreases negative thought, massively increases mood (further boosting the chance of a valid idea being shot down for perfectly acceptable but none-the-less simply current-problems (ie. not solutions found yet) all the while reducing chances, where taken with others, of being argued against.<br /><br />Basically, weed users don&#039;t like to argue bullshit but live in a fairy world, and this conflicts with the core processes of humanity&#039;s progression - we evolved by fighting against concensus.<br /><br />There is more to it than that but I&#039;m just waffling...btw, not high, drunk as shit :D

				+1 for an interesting reply. :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure I follow your line of thought there at the end, and the part about reducing chances of being argued with.&nbsp; Are you saying, basically, that weed smokers are too agreeable, and that this is bad for progression of the species?

				With such a strong family history of schizophrenia, I would avoid the MJ mate. If you have a predisposition to developing the disease yourself, the risk that you actually will is greatly increased if you smoke regularly. The risk of developing such a life altering disease as schizophrenia is definitely not worth it.<br /><br />Really though,&nbsp; it is daily/chronic consumption of cannabis that you need to avoid. A sneaky doob now and again is not going to get you sent off to the psychiatric hospital. If you can keep it that way, you&#039;ll be fine. You just have to be careful that those occasional joints do not turn into daily ones.

				sit them down and make them watch the union: the business behind getting high. if this doesn&#039;t sway their narrow views of cannabis, i don&#039;t think anything will.
