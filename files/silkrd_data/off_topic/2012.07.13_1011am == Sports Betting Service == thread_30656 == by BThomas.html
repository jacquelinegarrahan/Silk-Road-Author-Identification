				I would use SR gambling IF the vendor held enough escrow to cover the bets.<br /><br />If I bet 10 BTC on an Olympic event for example, and got the first scorer in some event or the winner at 10 - 1, I would like to think that there was enough coin to cover me.<br /><br />I need incentives to gamble outside of the legit betting office or online services with good odds.<br /><br />Tax aside, give us an example of how you can undercut RL outlets?

				I am essentially your old school bookie but with a website; that is why it is unique. The obvious reason is the no tax aspect and all transactions are cash or bitcoin and uncle sam never knows. I offer all the same plays you find in Vegas, I follow their lines, I DON&#039;T adjust them to my favor and you can always buy down half a point on a posted line for double the juice on a losing straight bet. No juice on parlays, teasers, exotics, futures, props, or A&amp;R&#039;s.

				I totally understand. No risk No reward pretty simple. You place bets and your team covers; I pay you. You place bets your team doesn&#039;t cover; you pay me. Try it for 100 bucks and you can see this is legit.

				The only difference is that I will send you cash money discretely through the mail. A cold hard 10 grand off a parlay concealed in a package is a nice gift.<br />Bottom line is if you want some action let me know, otherwise don&#039;t waste my time with idle chit chat and &quot;what if&quot; scenarios. <br />
