				You&#039;ve got some great choices on there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve recently been really enjoying Blackmill, both when rolling and tripping.<br /><br />Here are a few examples (note: clearnet links!):<br />&quot;Let it Be&quot; http://youtu.be/sDI6HTR9arA<br />&quot;Reach for Glory&quot; http://youtu.be/em3-CFkl3gY<br /><br />Hope you enjoy!&nbsp; Let me know if you like that kind of stuff, I can suggest similar artists.

				I like mostly rave music, so things by Darude, Darren Styles, that kind of music. My all time favorite for rolling is the song Technobeam by the New Deal. Go look it up on Grooveshark. It has the perfect come up, and then two minutes of pure heaven.

				I like to listen to dubstep while rolling.&nbsp; It&#039;s a very unique genre with a broad range of sounds, so even if you&#039;re not a fan of Skrillex or the &quot;brostep&quot; sound you should find something you like.&nbsp; I&#039;ll try to cover a broad range here. If you have a subwoofer handy, or some good headphones with good bass response, I suggest checking some of these tunes out.&nbsp; Even if not, most of them have nice ear candy in the mids/highs, although some of the &quot;deeper&quot; stuff might not.<br /><br />Emalkay - &quot;When I Look at You&quot;<br />Plastician - &quot;Japan&quot;<br />Psy:Am &amp; Stinkahbell - &quot;Don&#039;t Tell Mum About Ibiza&quot;<br />Biome - &quot;Space&quot;<br />Trolley Snatcha - &quot;Make My Whole World&quot;<br />Tek One - &quot;Broken String&quot;<br />The Others - &quot;Africa VIP&quot;<br />Ellie Goulding - &quot;Lights&quot; (remixes by Dream and Bassnectar)<br />AFK &amp; Dks - &quot;Shining&quot;<br />Kryptic Minds - &quot;Can&#039;t Sleep&quot;<br />La Roux - &quot;In For The Kill&quot; (Skream&#039;s Let&#039;s Get Ravey Remix)<br />Eddie K - &quot;Serial Killer&quot;<br />Subscape - &quot;Universal&quot;<br />Freestylers - &quot;Cracks&quot; (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br /><br />I could go on, if you&#039;re lazy/have ADD like me I&#039;d definitely also get Rusko &amp; Caspa&#039;s Fabriclive 37 DJ Mix.&nbsp; Probably one of the best mixes of the genre, to come out, like ever.<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend getting these songs in lossless FLAC/AIFF/WAV if you can, it definitely adds to the experience.&nbsp; Especially with things in higher ranges, like white noise &quot;whooshes&quot; and hi hats.<br />

				Call me old school, but last time I rolled with friends we played like late 70s disco and&nbsp; dance funk. Earth, wind, and fire, funky old george clinton with parliament funkadelic, James Brown ( whose drums are sampled to death! &quot; I don&#039;t know karate, but I know Ka-razy!&quot; LOL) even some up-tempo the black crows numbers.<br />And If you like the black crows ,so you have to go to the source with the rolling stones, exile on main street especially tumbling dice, loving cup, and happy. ( the black crowes ripped that record so much heh).<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t hate techno or dubstep electronic rave stuff. It just can all get a little &#039;same-ish&#039; formula wise. I love like early industrial stuff like ministry and nine inch nails. But we didn&#039;t play that, its a little harsh for a roll, heh. I really dig some chemical brothers remixes on rock songs. But hey what ever gets you happy and grooving on a roll, I say its all good.

				really digging a lot of tunes i&#039;m seeing...speaking of burial, kindred is a good new one, i think...<br /><br />for me:<br />emalkay- critical hit<br />mount kimbie- would know<br />siriusmo - high together<br />crystal castles - baptism (SERIOUSLY! :D ) <br />**crystal castles as a whole is pretty good for rolling, but crimewave, untrust us, and vanished come to mind)<br />neon indian - terminally chill (or deadbeat summer or should have taken acid with you...i like his first album for rolling more than his new one)<br />bibio-s&#039;vive<br />com truise-brokendale <br />JUSTICE<br />tycho-dictaphone&#039;s lament (x10)<br />geographer-kites<br />DAFT PUNK<br />flying lotus - massage situation and beginners falafel (and a bunch more :P)<br />gonjasufi - ancestors <br />washed out - feel it all around<br />tonikom-instar one<br />sexy sushi - distraction (fuck yeah french electropop! :P )<br />gold panda - triangle cloud (or fucking anything, i love this guy)<br />nit grit - prituri se planinata remix <br />nicolas jaar - space is only noise if you can see<br />hot chip - and i was a boy from school<br /><br />in terms of more ravey dubsteppy stuff, well, you cant go wrong with noisia or some nero, crizzly, older skrillex, benga, rusko, caspa, etc<br /><br />its just that i have been off of that dubstep, as it seems to have turned into a pissing contest of who can have the most balls to the wall guido fist pumping drop possible :P not to sound uppity, but i dont really like what i hear or see of &#039;mainstream&#039; dubstep lately...ill stick to my burial, james blake, mount kimbie and other like-minded folks, thank you very much! and hey, if i need some filthy sub-bass every once ina&nbsp; while, those artists listed and some others im forgetting provide me with enough already :D ....long live dubstep! *stares into a bleak future*<br /><br />what are y&#039;alls thoughts on the current state of &#039;mainstream dubstep&#039;? (in clubs, &#039;commercial raves&#039;, radio, tv, etc)<br /><br />also, sorry in advance if this was a rambling post&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				im in agreement with you romantic era about the current dubstep. i do still like it in small doses, or when im going out and in the right mood but have found myself steering towards drum and bass/garage/funky more whilst at home choosing my own songs. <br /><br />i want to avoid saying that dubstep is shit now etc etc because its not, its just the wobble wobble that has gained popularity isnt my cup of tea. i dont understand why its hasnt been relabeled with its own sub-genre name? look at dnb and garage music, both have lots of sub categories. dubstep is such a wide category. <br /><br />that said, cant go wrong with some trolley snatcha or&nbsp; in a a little club with a strobe light in your face...<br /><br />sorry OP hope i didnt ruin you thread il stop now&nbsp; :-X

				Andrew Bayer &amp; Matt Lange feat.

But that tune I linked is one of my favs at the moment.<br />

				Sorry young fellas, I just looked at my old post in here, and realized I&#039;m the old creepy guy in the room. Geez, no wonder my avatar is a facepalm. Sorry go back to your raving, trancing, and dub-stepping. I will just be over here in the corner doing the &#039;Charleston&#039; (that&#039;s an Old-timey dance). &quot;32 ska-do!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />.....These kids today with their hair and their clothes.... bah.. ahh.. oww my back..... lol.

				In my opinion there is only ONE song that really seems to embody the experience.<br /><br />&quot;Fasten Your Seatbelts&quot; by Pendulum<br />It starts off a little odd, which I feel embodies the dizziness and lightheaded feeling that I get for a few minutes when it hits me.<br />Then, we&#039;re off.<br />Also, with it&#039;s almost wave like bass I feel that it just fits sooo well (because MDMA seems to hit me in waves and it&#039;s just great).

				EOS is a pretty good DJ, along with un4bomber and Downlink for dubstep.&nbsp; Item 9 also.&nbsp; Look them up on soundcloud.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually got a huge list of artists I like to listen to while rolling.&nbsp; DJ Pekas especially if you like electro.

				I love threads like this started another similar one entitled what&#039;s your theme song for SR, but to contribute here, I thought I&#039;d throw this one out, friend of mine sent me this song a while back and I really enjoy it, great for late night trips if you live in the city like myself.&nbsp; When I trip I like to listen to all kinds of music, although predominantly 90&#039;s grunge/alt rock and house.<br /><br />http://vimeo.com/12220236<br /><br />just in case some of you guys are too paranoid to go to the link directly for whatever reason, the song is called Fantômes by Joakim, a french electronic musician &amp; graphic artist<br /><br />Here&#039;s another one, it&#039;s an 8 bit mix of Take On Me by A-ha, I love this... puts a big smile on my face whilst tripping or candyflippin&#039;<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C_M1TNNeHg
