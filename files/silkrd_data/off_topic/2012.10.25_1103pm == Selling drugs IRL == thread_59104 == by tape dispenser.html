				So it&#039;s come to this - my goal is to purchase drugs, mostly MDMA and weed but anything I can find a market with a workable profit margin for - and sell them IRL for a profit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any dreams of huge profit or anything - I just need enough to survive so I don&#039;t end up on the streets.&nbsp; Minimum wage where I am works out to about $1300/month - meeting that is my immediate goal, anything else is gravy.<br /><br />The only real obstacle right now is getting a client base.&nbsp; Save a street level weed dealer who I&#039;m trying to market MDMA to his buyers, I pretty much know no one who&#039;d be interested in buying.&nbsp; How do I find clients?&nbsp; How can I advertise?&nbsp; There&#039;s got to be some good creative ideas I haven&#039;t thought of.<br /><br />Let the hate begin.

				1 Watch all seasons of Breaking Bad.<br />2 Give up idea of becoming a dealer IRL<br /><br />to be honest if you can buy cheap stuff in bulk I&#039;d become a SR trader. It is 10x safer than being a dealer IRL. Think about it. The BTC you earn is partly spent on product and partly saved, if you don&#039;t need cash you don&#039;t have to worry about how to cash out, your bank accounts look squeaky clean. You send all product anonymously not even cameras to record your mailings. You erase all customer details no need to keep a little black book or burner cell phones. Christ you could repeatedly sell to the feds, and still be safe. Compare to the risks RL dealers have.

				two words..... mushroom capsules. If you are near a college and can get in with the right crowds or if you are a festival/music goer you can make a killing off reselling my mushroom capsules. I know a few locals i used to vend to were selling the caps 4 for 20 and making a TON off my oz and qp.&nbsp; 8)<br />I will be back in biz soon but check out my vendor profile.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly if you need to ask about it here than your not cut out for it. I met all of my customers through a few friends when i let them try my mdma that i got from here and they all loved it. After that i got hit up a bunch by people literally begging for it. At that point i decided to cash in&nbsp; ;) You REALLY should not deal if its a chore for you to find customers! and a rule of advice: Never deal any hard drugs that you enjoy using!! (opiates, coke, meth etc.) And seeing as you dont seem to know much about the subject i have a few very important tips: 1. Never deal out of where you live! 2. Keep your customer base as low as possible, you want to work with a small amount of people who pick up a large amount of product. I personally only sell to 5 close friends and they do the lower level distribution.

				OP, i would suggest you go to college. College dorms are drug infested place. I sell shit IRL, i sell to all my friends, they get uber quality at half rates on the street, they happy me happy. Also i would suggest, its important to get a loyal customer base, and deal to guys that u know, rather than finding people at nightclubs,etc because this is much less stealthy and im my city atleast, would end up with me in jail quite soon (i live in India, lol half the people would go &#039;DRUGSSSSSSSSS, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and call the cops&#039;). I started doing drugs much before selling them, and thats why i know and trust most of the guys i sell to, and i would really love to keep it that way. Money will come man, make sure you keep safe and sustainable

				Fuck i just realized something, you might have meant as a full on profession, so maybe disregard what i said lol. Mine is more of a part time hobby, and i am in college. I seriously doubt i will continue after college. I am pretty sure i will never give up SR though, so maybe i will keep supplying my friends throughout life? Who knows lol.

				If I may chime in here... seriously consider the risk/reward ratio of becoming the street-level drug dealer that you&#039;re thinking of becoming. You are going to have to bust your ass and expose yourself to a lot of risk for what will end up being only marginal profit. You&#039;re better off just getting a job at a grocery store, in fact, you can take your chances selling to your co-workers. Everybody knows that grocery store employees love to get high! So I would advise that you do a legit, entry-level job and get paid that way, with a little bit of bonus cash from a deal here and there.<br /><br />Whatever path you go down, good luck, and be careful.

				as someone else said in this thread, you don&#039;t just BECOME a drug dealer, you have to have the connections first.<br /><br />That being said, with the limited amount of connections that I have, if it were not for the Silk Road I would be out on my ass.<br />I was out of work for almost a month and living off of my meager profits from selling personal amounts to friends.<br />That does not mean paying my rent and bills, that means putting gas in my tank, herb in my pipe and food in my dog&#039;s dish.<br /><br />If you want to be full time then you need to do a lot more networking first.

				this will not help you at all, but its best to start in high school when your young and friends are all around you then your friends go to college and make friends who buy large amounts then you order off here and drive to the college they go to with out opening the package then distribute it there $$$$$

				1. Option: Sell Drugs in clearnet. Searchthe net for drug forums or pishing/stealing/carding forums where people talk about illegal thinks. Then register and try to sell drugs.<br /><br />2. Option: Ask everybody and say: &quot;Hey my friend want a bigger amount of stuff. Do you know somebody how sells 10g+?&quot;&nbsp; If you find someone, you say &quot;Okay i found another one with even bigger amounts, but i can sell you some stuff for xx$&quot;<br /><br />3. Option: Use your education and try to get a standard job. <br /><br />Option 3 is definitely the best one!!!

				like most have said, nobody really plans to become a drug dealer. Opportunities arise and some seize them while most dont. I would suggest NEVER to be scared but to be smart. Most successful dealers IRL are fairly smart depending on the level of operation they have met. If your going to do something, you shouldn&#039;t accept being mediocre at it, regardless of what it is. I must add that being a street level dealer is alot more work than supplying street level dealers. You have SR at your fingertips, if you cant utilize this resource easily IRL then yea, you probably shouldnt try to.
