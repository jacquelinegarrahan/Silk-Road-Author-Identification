And the yeah I guessed from how candid you were that it was well known, the definition of madness IMO. <br /><br />And yeah I know, I had a quick look at it a min ago when ya posted the URL. It&#039;s the fact that it asks you to put emails and URLs in the search bar in the first place. I would shit a fucking BRICK if I found out anything to do with me was on there and contact the admin to have it removed. I&#039;m also not a fan of the idea of the fact that accessing a site that is clearly widely known about by the law being on your net history because I&#039;m pretty sure that not everyone who uses that site goes through TOR to do it.... Also I can&#039;t really be bothered to look myself but I&#039;m guessing that those clearweb sites that sell RCs and stuff on and the clearweb forums are rated on there as well? If that&#039;s the case and they talk about how they use the drugs they buy from there and that then no fucking wonder all that shit happened recently. Just sounds like a fucking disaster waiting to happen to me.

				Lol I did hear about Tor from the media dude. :P I am not an IT-nut, never have been really. Money/Drugs are my area. :)<br /><br />And yeah but how do you register the website URL anonymously? If you can do that GENUINELY anonymously and then host the site anonymously on the clearweb then fair do&#039;s I guess but I am rather skeptical of this. Although having said that if you can show me that ya can and explain it please go ahead and show me the light on this. :)<br /><br />And yeah YOU do, I WOULD, I hope to Christ everyone on here would as well but the world is, undoubtedly, made up of retards as well as people with common sense. I wouldn&#039;t want fucking Google, Microsoft, or Apple if you use Safari or fuck it, any other Clearweb browser that you care to mention knowing that I&#039;m checking out the best place to by my rave tipple, or even no doubt a kilo of whatever my favourite thing is to sell. You did give me that email and you said he was shottin 100s of keys of his main product every calender. Also why the barnacle bill would you allow someone who sells 100s of keys of whatever illegal shit it was to be on your clearnet site and be recommended to others to use? If they think that is legal they have another thing coming, that comes with about 5 different charges off the top of my head but there&#039;s probably more that can go on top if I checked it out. Madness. <br /><br />And yeah that&#039;s the shit I was referring to. I never actually went to those forums or whatnot myself, just heard about that stuff on the threads on here about it. I saw the sheet that was done by the feds on whoever this &quot;w00t&quot; character was and I&#039;m sorry but that man sounds like he could be the life-form with the lowest possible intelligence on the fuckin planet. He was talking about washing money and importing drugs....on Skype and he had a conversation on Skype with a fed. If anyone asked to talk to me on Skype they would get a royal (yeah...this is so bad I&#039;m bringing Liz into this) FUCK RIGHT OFF. I don&#039;t even talk to the people I work with on Skype. Only people I talk to on Skype are my legit clients, my broker, my friends and my dear old Mam. They aren&#039;t even canaries in the coal mine, they are just sheep and they are sheep that are probably just better off being shot because &quot;It would be the kindest thing to do&quot;. <br /><br />And yeah I see the positive side of having SOS, I think the principle of it is a good idea. I just think that having it on the clearnet is complete folly along with any forums where recreational drugs can be sold tbh.

				sometimes I think your fucking with me Limitless.....FH=Freedom Hosting.

Clearly this Mike kid isn&#039;t just a snitch, he&#039;s a stupid snitch as well lol. Was Mike a member of the staff on that AK sit too? <br /><br />From what ya said they sound a bit fruity. I sell RCs but only the ones I can get rid of in the U.K IRL, not bothered about all these fruity analogues, they just sound like an accident waiting to happen. I&#039;m ditchin them and just gunna do Meph and Ket soon. :)

				Yeah +1. It makes for a quite interesting yarn to see idiots get fucked over. Still can&#039;t quite get my head around the fact they use Skype to actually talk properly, I assumed it was just Skype IM before. Get&#039;s worse and worse lol. Balls up from the word go or what!?

I know I am in the U.K but as ML is my area I can say with a fairly high level of certainty that discussing laundering money and then forming a conspiracy to do it is rings the illegal bell pretty fucking hard in the U.S as well as the U.K lol. <br /><br />Also Shan, if they even need to discuss laundering money they know damn well that doing that shit is illegal. If things aren&#039;t illegal then you don&#039;t have to wash money. Simple as that. What they are trying to do is have their fucking cake and eat it lol. And we all know what happens when you eat too much cake, you have a heart attack and die lol. Which, is exactly what happened with this lol.
