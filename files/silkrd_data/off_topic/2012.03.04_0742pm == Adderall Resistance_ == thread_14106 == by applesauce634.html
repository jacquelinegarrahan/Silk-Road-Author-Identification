				1) It&#039;s SO nice to finally have a place that I can talk about stuff like this without having to say that gay SWIM shit :)<br /><br />2) I&#039;ve taken adderall about 4-5 times before this. (50mg at a time) all ATLEAST two weeks apart and each time I had an AWESOME euphoric buzz. (I also have a really really really bad comedown; I get depressed and suicidal and completely un-motivated -- Lasts ~ 4 hours.)<br /><br />But any ways, it&#039;s been approx 1-1/2 weeks since I&#039;ve taken any. Today at 9 am I took 50mg of XR. After an 1-1/2 hours I started to feel a moderate come down already. (I had been setting down on my laptop and playing halo with friends the entire time.) After that it went away and I started to get hungry. I knew SOMETHING was awry, but I didn&#039;t know what. And I know the stuff that I got IS legit stuff. It&#039;s a close friends girl friends prescription and I trust her, and my friend didn&#039;t notice anything off about the pills. (I got them from his personal stash.) Anyways, after I got up the light headedness hit me ever so faintly. I then ate a grilled cheese and some Doritos. Half way through that my appetite started to disappear. (This is a little over 3 hours in.)<br />After that I walked back to my friends room and sat down. The adderall then (and still) started working slightly, but by no means did I reach a euphoria. <br /><br />So this got me thinking.<br />1) Is it possible that I just build up a resistance even though I barely take the stuff? Note: I&#039;ve always had a high tolerance to stuff. I went to the hospital for a procedure which I was extremely, extremely nervous about, and the loaded me up with medication because of that. All of which was intended to calm me. Needless to say none of it had any effect, but that could have just been because I had such high anxiety, nearly to the point of an attack. The procedure in itself wasn&#039;t ALL that painful though. <br />Anyways, I had to go back and get it again. (The awesome doctors fucked up.) They DOUBLED the dosage of what they gave me (Was vallium and two other things) and it still barely hit me. <br />2) If not that, is it just because I haven&#039;t been active at all? Like should I get up and walk around until it full kicks in or something, because this was just a pathetic waste of money.<br /><br />---<br />This other part is just another adderall experience that I would appreciate some thoughts on if anyone is feeling anxious/wants to read for some reason. <br /><br />Note: This was the experience from 1-1/2 weeks ago. <br /><br />I hadn&#039;t taken any adderall in a long time, so I was more than ready. Well my friend that I get it from hadn&#039;t purchased his stash yet; he was getting it at lunch. He did however have one 25mg pill with him, so I took it. Around noon we got the rest of the pills and I took another 25mg adderall. Well needless to say I never reached got a full euphoric buzz. Maybe 3/8 there. <br />And to top if off, my come down hit me at TWO PM. I usually get a good 13 hours in with adderall before it wears off! <br /><br />What has been going on with this stuff?<br /><br />Thanks a ton everyone ;)

				1) .... So then this is about someone who IS you then? FREEZE! <br />2) How are you taking it? Because eh... Your post sort of reads like it was written by someone on Adderall:) .. It&#039;s not supposed to cause euphoria, y&#039;know. People respond to it differently, and if you&#039;ve actually got some of the conditions that the medication is used to treat, you may just feel . . . . Better. So really massive several-hours-long euphoria is the Strange symptom, savvy?

				For someone who seldom takes adderall, a 50mg dose should cause quite a bit of euphoria. As Shredder mentioned, your post reads like it was written on adderall - so I bet you are feeling something. I am not a big fan of adderall but have still taken it quite a lot for school and work. Used to take upwards of 200mg a day during finals. Adderall does not feel the same every time. Some days, 50mg may get you extremely high while other days you feel very little. Perhaps it was just one of those days where 50mg did not hit you very hard.<br /><br />Another possibility is the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period is wearing off. The first X number of times you take a drug, it is new and different so your body doesn&#039;t know what to expect. It is usually those first X number of times taking a drug where that drug is the best it will ever be. Once your body has kind of gotten used to the effects it just isn&#039;t the same. This is not the same as physical tolerance although they are related. Tolerance is probably not an issue seeing as you haven&#039;t taken any in a week and a half.

				Ugh, I responded do this but something went wrong, it didn&#039;t go through and lost it :( <br />(Probably because I&#039;m using someones satellite internet connection. On top of being slow in itself we went over the allocated daily bandwidth so it&#039;s super slow. Every page takes so long to load even on SR xD) <br /><br />But any ways, in response to the two replies:<br /><br />I am feeling something yes, it&#039;s just not the same. I&#039;m in a way &quot;floating&quot; between an approx 3/8 euphoric state and a depressive overwhelmed come down state. It&#039;s hard to describe, but it&#039;s weird. <br />But that is definitely why I&#039;m typing like this. (The previous times I had taken adderall and went on forums everything I typed was PERFECT. (Though extremely lengthy.)) This is just, well I don&#039;t even know. It&#039;s between a &quot;I don&#039;t care&quot; state and a &quot;I can take on the world!&quot; state. <br /><br />And @ shredder - I know it&#039;s not MADE to cause a euphoria, but it does. I&#039;ve heard a lot of people on ADD forums saying that it does, and it does for all of my real life friends that take it. But that&#039;s what makes me like it so much. (That and the extreme focus.) But I&#039;m kinda eh this time. (Approx 3/8 there like I said above, but that mixed with &quot;floating&quot; between states I&#039;m only like 1/8 what I usually am.)<br /><br />And I was also thinking about what Fred said, about the honeymoon period, it just slipped my mind between then and now. I think that may be right, it just seems strange that it would be such a drastic change. <br />And I definitely didn&#039;t know that it affects you different at different times. <br /><br />Do you guys think that it could also be due to a lack of sleep? I only got like 6 hours of sleep, but I got like 15 the night before xD<br />In the past when I took adderall I got anywhere from 6.5-9 hours of sleep. <br />And is there any chance that it&#039;s because I haven&#039;t been moving around/have just been setting in this dudes bed? (No homo o.O) <br /><br />&amp; Thanks for the help so far Shredder &amp; Fred. This is definitely one of those things where the more you know the better ;p

				I&#039;m in a similar situation as the OP, so I&#039;ll be watching this thread.<br /><br />By the way applesauce, have you done any other stimulants recently? Ecstasy, any other amphetamines, etc.?

If you meant just a general pretty-good feeling, then yeah Addies will do that:)&nbsp; What was said earlier about the &quot;honeymoon&quot; rings true, though. Be careful upping your dosages so quickly; you may end up with a monkey on your back much quicker than you&#039;d end up catching that feeling again.

				I can only speak about my experience, but yes there is definitely such a thing as Adderall tolerance. However, I used it daily for months at a time, and it seems unlikely to me that you&#039;d develop much tolerance to it with the casual, sporadic use you describe. <br /><br />Best guess? You were tired, or maybe overly full, when you took it. Or, was the latest dose XR, and earlier doses IR? That makes a huge difference.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never used the XR, but with IR at least you can crush it and snort it for faster onset. I don&#039;t care to use it that way myself, since it gives you funky saccharin sweet rainbow colored snot, but it seems popular with many people.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard you can shove it up your butt and it&#039;s much more effective. I&#039;ve never wanted the buzz bad enough to try that though.&nbsp; :o
