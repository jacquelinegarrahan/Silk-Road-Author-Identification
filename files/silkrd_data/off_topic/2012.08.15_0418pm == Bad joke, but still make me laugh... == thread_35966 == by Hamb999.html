				A 17th Century captain was sailing along with his crew when a pirate ship came over the horizon. <br />The captain says, &quot;Cabin boy, get me my red shirt.&quot; <br />So, he gets his red shirt and they victoriously battle the pirates. Several days later, they spot another pirate ship off the port bow. <br />&quot;Cabin boy,&quot; says the captain &quot;get me my red shirt.&quot; <br />They again battle the pirates and are victorious. <br />Later when things had settled down, the cabin boy asks, &quot;Captain, why do you always want your red shirt before battle?&quot; <br />The captain responds, &quot;Well, in case I am wounded, I don&#039;t want the crew to see my injury and lose spirit.&quot; <br />&quot;I see,&quot; says the cabin boy. <br />A few days later, they spot 20 pirate ships in the distance. <br />The captain yells out, &quot;Cabin boy, get me my brown pants.&quot; <br />
