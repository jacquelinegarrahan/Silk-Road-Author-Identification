				This thread was prompted by my appreciation for Star Trek. Dr McCoy can synthesize pretty much any compound imaginable in the medical lab of the enterprise. And then he could use the transporter to beam packages for free, instantaneous shipping seven days a week! Just pgp your transporter coordinates. And I doubt even the federation could curtail the black market use of Bitcoin in their foolishly idealistic money free society. <br /><br />In episode 43, Wolf in the Fold, McCoy dispenses this silly drink which makes everyone giggly and immune to fear, so as to starve the space ghost of Jack the Ripper who feeds on the emotion of terror.<br /><br />In episode 24, This Side of Paradise, some whack flower has spores potent enough to make the whole crew mutiny and beam down to live as agrarians on this pretty planet, and it even makes Mr. Spock fall in love with some chick. <br /><br />In episode 06, Mudd&#039;s Women, Harry Mudd has these really ugly chicks hooked on the Venus Drug, which makes ugly people attractive, so that he can sell them as wives. Might be good to cut mdma with that. <br /><br />There are definitely more from Star Trek, but I can&#039;t remember just this minute.<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to try some of that substance D they have in a scanner darkly. I hear it fucks you up. And there is Soma in Brave New World. And that Valkyr junk from Max Payne, seems intense.

				Discussed this with my friends before and what I&#039;d love is to find a drug that is a cross between MDMA and K that could put you into a sort of MDMA-hole or an &quot;M-hole&quot;.

				I agree about NZT. Also the bug powder from Naked Lunch, deepweed from Shadowrun, nuke from Robocop 2, skooma from Elder Scrolls, Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, Romulan Ale, SQUID from Strange Days (not sure if that counts as a drug), substance D from A Scanner Darkly, swampweed from Gothic, valkyr from Max Payne, and zyme from Deus Ex.<br /><br />Hope I didn&#039;t miss any&nbsp; ;)

				I want some CAN-D or CHEW-Z, from Philip K.

Anyone living there would have a limitless pharmacological playground.<br /><br />The way the milk bar is described in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; presents it as offering a wide variety of additives with a broad range of effects.
