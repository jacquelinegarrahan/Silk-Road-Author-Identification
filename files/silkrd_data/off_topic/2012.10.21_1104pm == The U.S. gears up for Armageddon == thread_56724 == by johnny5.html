				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN5FMaZDllQ<br /><br />It has become almost crystal clear we are near the end of all things.<br />Strange noises coming from the sky around the world, massive flocks of birds and see animals dying out of nowhere. etc etc etc........<br /><br />Now my message to any police officers who may have user accounts here or on the road. Let the stoner&#039;s smoke their weed, it takes the edge off of this craziness. Seriously, bigger things are going on, why bust people for trying to smoke a plant that helps them calm down ?<br /><br />I for one am NOT looking forward to living in times, where you will be killed by someone just curious to see whats in your pockets that they can use to survive another day.<br /><br />I never thought the world would end in my lifetime, but it is exactly in my lifetime that most of the signs are actually happening. As a kid this was always my biggest fear, after seeing the movie &quot; the day after &quot; that they played on television in the 80&#039;s.<br /><br />and fuck me it&#039;s happening.... we&#039;ve come so far and built the world up so much, it will be gone within seconds, all the work we did. Think about it, we used to ride around by horse and live in log cabins many years ago, look how far we&#039;ve come and all that we will lose.

				In fairness, thats a heap of ignorant paranoid rubbish and not going to happen. Your deluding yourself to the actual problems, this conspiracy rubbish its like religion, its absolute fantasy &quot;the opium of the masses&quot; and just a distraction to what IS wrong with our world. <br /><br />The Zombie Apocalypse..... now thats a total different story!

				This zombie apocalypse will likely come from all the people on SR and around the world, who do &quot; experimental research chemicals &quot; those will turn into zombies, im not worried about kids on 2c-b coming after me drooling. there are bigger things going on than THAT !<br /><br />so you got a good explanation of what the tanks are for then jollyroger, since you believe the video is some kind of allusion and not real. it&#039;s very real, the tanks you see in the video are not a mirage and the video was not edited or dumbed up. real people shot this video as they were stopped at a RR crossing.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=56724.msg536724#msg536724">Quote from: TheJolllyRoger on October 21, 2012, 11:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Zombie Apocalypse..... now thats a total different story!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Their made in factories and sold all around the world mate, same as guns, rockets, ships, ammunition, jets, hum vee&#039;s etc? Dont you think they might be just transporting them to bases around the country to update the current model tanks and selling on the older models, or moving them to airports to sell to the Israelis etc? Their small tanks compared to most too.<br /><br />Americans have been saying this paranoid stuff with the last 50 years, for nothing, and its caused hundreds of thousands of senseless deaths, time to get real me thinks!<br /><br />I personally think they should be spending the money on the thousands of malnourished kids in the US, the poor, rhe unemployed, the homeless, social services etc but you dont get that with an imperialist country, Its all about the ignorance and violence.
