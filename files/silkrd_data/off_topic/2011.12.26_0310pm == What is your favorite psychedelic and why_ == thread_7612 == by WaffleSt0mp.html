				shrooms - spiritual and therapeutic reasons<br /><br />Every time I have a problem, like I can&#039;t decide a major decision in my life, then shrooms help give me the answer. It has taught me amazing lessons and so far has not failed me. I&#039;m grateful to have it in my life.<br /><br />However, it isn&#039;t a fun party drug, so it might not be what you&#039;re looking for.

				5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT)<br /><br /><br />Most all other psychedelics or dissociatives alter the current reality. For example: LSD changes perception on colors and sounds or might make you see something that isn&#039;t there... but that&#039;s all an alteration of reality not a change. For both 5-MeO-DMT and DMT, your complete reality is changed. You more or less enter a different realm all together all which is met with colors, visuals, sounds. You&#039;re left with no sense of the current reality you reside in. It&#039;s almost as if you become a different being in a different reality all together.<br /><br />It&#039;s the most intense tryptamine I&#039;ve tried to date.<br /><br />Truly a life changing experience.<br /><br />-DF<br />drugfather

				I like LSD more than any drug in any category.&nbsp; Every color seems to glow and becomes more vivid than ever thought possible, and to me, the trip feels absolutely pure in lower dosages.&nbsp; It just makes everything beautiful and offers a deeper introspective view that I do not find in other drugs.

				But acid was also the first drug I&#039;ve ever wanted to do so I may be romanticizing it a bit; it isn&#039;t a drug I take in stride... it is always a big deal to me.&nbsp; ::)

				my favorite pschedelic (if you would choose to classify it that way) is ketamine.&nbsp; i am a bit of a control freak, mostly sticking to substances these days where i can maintain good self-control, and ketamine for me is like a powerful lucid dream that i enter consciously.&nbsp; in higher doses i can commune with the goddess.&nbsp; ketamine gave me a significant spiritual awakening, and my experiences have shaped my entire view of the world, universe, afterlife, and metaphysical reality.&nbsp; <br />other hallucinogens have just showed me parts of myself.&nbsp; not without merit tho...<br /><br />*destiny*

				Yeah 5-Meo-DMT is some serious business.&nbsp; However I think N,N-DMT provides the same depth and introspection as 5-Meo with less chances of having a purely dark and terrifying trip.&nbsp; Not that you can&#039;t have a good 5-Meo-DMT trip, I just find the chances lower.<br /><br />So my vote goes to N,N-DMT.&nbsp; Not only do i get amazing introspection and ego loss, but I have a blast the entire time.&nbsp; I find myself getting more euphoria from a good DMT trip than any other drug.&nbsp; I really wish it was active orally, friggin pain in the ass to find a good place to smoke it outdoors with no disturbances.&nbsp; Can&#039;t smoke it indoors in my situation.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll try higher doeses of 4-aco-dmt, that&#039;s a decent orally active psychedelic.&nbsp;

				Have to agree with the shrooms for things I&#039;ve tried so far. It&#039;s always pretty relaxing for me, nothing too intense, and does help me sort life issues as well.

				In June I did a therapeutic high dose of psilocybin with an experienced sitter. I ingested 6.9 grams dried. Psilocybin is a serious sacred medicine. Three months later, with the same sitter, I ingested 6 grams dried. I would suggest 5 grams psilocybin will easily work. At the much higher doses there was, with me, a higher chance of some delusions. The mushrooms have a special place with me. At these larger doses, they are definitely not &quot;fun.&quot;<br /><br />Changa was like a 10 minute psilocybin trip... too quick to work with, but nice to be in and out.<br /><br />MDMA, though not technically a pychedelic, has a special place in my heart.<br /><br />LSD is Love.<br /><br />I am going to do my first ayahuasca journey in 5 days.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				shrooms have almost always been fun for me.&nbsp; not sure what the difference between acid and LSD is, but i took one of them once and was talking to little grey aliens and riding in UFOs (not fun).&nbsp; haven&#039;t done acid or lsd since.

				Lots of good info here. I really want to try DMT but I&#039;m a little hesitant to enter a new realm. I&#039;m afraid it might to be intense. <br /><br />Shrooms are good but I&#039;ve only had 1 good experience on those. Also I can never remember the experience for some reason. <br /><br />LSD is my favorite, the set and setting is easier to control and I feel that its more flexible then mushrooms. <br /><br />But its surprising that no one is saying anything about the 2c family.

				I snorted 40mg of 2cc once, besides the horrible stinging pain, it took nearly two hours to kick in and then it just made me all smiley (but not happy, I was actually paranoid as hell) for 4 hours.

				Glad I&#039;m not the only one. I took 2c-b once and it took 8 hrs to kick in. I totally forgot about it because I thought it was bunk. But I thought someone but something in my drink at the party I was at but my friend reminded me of&nbsp; the 2c-b. It was a fun time I was drunk and a little unprepared to start tripping.
