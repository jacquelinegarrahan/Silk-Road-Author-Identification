				I did an 8ball of cocaine on Thursday, then Friday found out I will have a NAMSHA 5 panel on Tuesday afternoon. Needless to say I was not as concerned because in general I believe it is out in 3-5 days. After more research I am reading alot of conflicting reports about heavy use. I&#039;m not sure if an 8ball is a heavy amount or not but I&#039;m not a regular user. I have been pounding water, green tea, and exercising vigorously the past two days and plan to continue til the day of the test. I am also hitting the sauna every day. Anyone have any tips or experience with this type of situation? Thanks in advance...

				Drugstore urine kit popped me at 5-6 days post IV use, maybe a gram every other day or so for a week prior.&nbsp; Oddly it didn&#039;t pickup my cherry popping heroin night from from 4 days out.&nbsp; Push fluids, be very, very hydrated day of test.&nbsp; Catch urine in mid stream if that&#039;s what it is, make sure you don&#039;t offer first piss of the morning.&nbsp; Dilution is your friend brother, good luck

				NAMSHA 5 is the standard 5 panel urine screen. Well shit... 48 hrs after last dose today and I was definitely dirty with an @home, although I could see the very faintest line about to show up. I got about 72 hours now so that gives me a bit of hope. Gonna keep up this flushing and hope for the best. I think even a faint line is considered passing. Tabbenoit did you flush and exercise or just let it go on its own?

				Any line in the negative panel at the specified time for the test - any line at all, ANY shadow -&nbsp; means the test is considered negative.&nbsp; The intensity of the line doesn&#039;t matter.<br />-Must- hit threshold to be considered positive.<br />There should be an interpretation sheet with the test kit.<br /><br />--f.<br />(search for&nbsp; [ SAMHSA urine drug interpretation ] - lots out there)<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks! I&#039;m aware of the list of ++positive metabolites with no credible alternate explanation.<br />Cocaine metabolites would be #1 on that list. <br />I wish more people knew that. Glad you brought it up.<br /><br />--f.<br /><br /><br />

I am not a habitual user... Just ended up using an 8ball that day. Haven&#039;t done it for months before that... I&#039;m just doing all I can to flush until the day of the test.... I reckon I will probably be okay! Will post back tomorrow night after another @home.

				By dilution of course I meant, crazy hydration.&nbsp; They way I look at it if they flag you for a sample that is not concentrated enough and ask you back another day you&#039;ve just bought yourself another 24 hrs.&nbsp; An innocent excuse would be you wanted to make sure you could pee for them.

				Table spoon of ACV with every meal and before bed, followed eaqch with at least 500ml of water, started whole process 3 days before urine screen (not sure specifics of type of test, but was for entrance into U/G mining), pissed water at the screen and passed fine!<br /><br />NOTE: I had been chronic for about 3 yrs, been mostly off it in the month beforehand, but binged in celebration 5 days before the test, hoping like hell the ACV tip from my flatmate worked!<br />ALSO NOTE: The longevity of shrubbery in your system far exceeds most powders and crystals... I&#039;m led to believe anyhow!<br /><br />Hope this helps!
