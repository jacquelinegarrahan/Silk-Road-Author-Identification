				Does anyone have any feedback or have tried out his stuff yet?&nbsp; I tried his blotters and they&#039;re bunk. Nothing happened. I haven&#039;t taken two yet but then I tried these other blotters he sent and they tasted a bit odd kinda like 25i.&nbsp; So whats up with this dude? <br /><br />&nbsp;I really don&#039;t think he&#039;s selling LSD at all! Watch out.

				Reading his vendor page he seems like he is honestly trying to fix the situation. His supplier and/or friend fucked him over and he is trying to make things right. I bought a few of his lotto tickets for 2x 150ug tabs to see whats up. He even said if you lost the lotto he would refund your purchase. But of course this is all based on his word. Maybe I&#039;m just being too hopeful.

				NO WAY this guy is legit. He is either a scammer or a pig. No one sells acid for as cheap as he advertised and you gotta remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Also, use your head - no one will undercut the average price by ~50-200 on the road unless it&#039;s bunk, just use common sense and stay away from this retard
