				You get cool ass shit like kittycopters!!! Gotta see the video, god I want one of these badly! I&#039;d go to the park every weekend just to see the looks of disgust or laughter on peoples faces when I&#039;m chasing kids around with my kittycopter. This might motivate me to get into taxidermy for roadkill, maybe a opossumcopter is in the future.<br /><br />http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9313591/Orvillecopter-rises-value-of-cat-helicopter-increase-tenfold.html<br /><br />Bart Jansen, the artist, is expected to turn a tidy profit after stuffing his cat Orville after it was run over by a car before attaching motors and propellers to turn his pet into an airborne work of art.<br />Mr Jansen had originally put a £8,000 (€12,500) price tag on cat helicopter, which was on display in Amsterdam as part of the KunstRai art fair but Dutch newspaper Volkskrant today reported that its value has soared.<br />“The work has not yet been sold but we have an offer of €100,000 on the table,” Mr Jansen&#039;s dealer Geoffrey van Vugt told the newspaper.<br />The flying cat has been heavily criticised by Dutch animal lovers and the gallery that exhibits it has been daubed with graffiti saying “kill the animal killers”.<br />The Dutch animal welfare party, which is part of the country’s ruling coalition government, has written to the art fair organisers in protest.<br /><br />Last year, a Dutch conceptual artist known as Tinkebell was found not guilty of animal cruelty for an exhibit featuring 95 hamsters in exercise balls.<br />She also caused outrage for killing her “depressed” pet cat and turning it into a handbag.<br />Volkskrant reported that Mr Jansen decided to turn Orville into an aircraft because his pet cat and its brother Wilbur, which is still alive, had been named after the Wright brotherswho invented and built the world&#039;s first successful plane.

				This is hilarious<br /><br />LOL @ the animal lovers. They need to grow the fuck up. It&#039;s not like he killed the cat for this purpose.. It was already dead. So what are they saying &quot;How dare you not put the corpse of that lifeless animal to decompose in the ground.. How dare you use its body for entertainment&quot;.. Fucking lunatics.<br /><br />Ironically, I bet these obsessive cat lovers are exactly the sort of people that get no pussy.
