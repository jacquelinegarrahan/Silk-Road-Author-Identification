				Yeah, the S should have the circle with the bar going through it -- ie the universal symbol for &quot;no&quot; :) -- on top of it, when scripts are blocked.

				That&#039;s mostly a myth perpetuated in onionland. I don&#039;t know where it started, but I first noticed it on the Hidden Wiki, where clearnet links were labeled with big warnings. Then people did it on this forum. For some reason, people believe clearnet sites are more dangerous than hidden services.<br /><br />A hidden service could supply malicious scripts just as easily as a clearnet site, and a hidden service operator knows that his visitors don&#039;t want to be identified, so he may have more interest / reason to try to deanonymize them, whereas random clearnet sites don&#039;t give a shit about identifying proxy users. They just block them if they become a nuisance.<br /><br />The likelihood of getting pwned by some random JavaScript is vanishingly small, while blocking scripts will break a lot of functionality on clearnet sites. I&#039;ve been using Tor for years, mostly without blocking scripts, and it hasn&#039;t been a problem so far. Of course it could be, but the cost-benefit analysis doesn&#039;t make me worry about it.

				You might want to check out Freedom Hosting but you need an invite code http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/<br /><br />I assumed the clearnet warning was done so you&#039;d know you&#039;d be popping out a tor exit node if you click the link?<br />

The basic idea would be that I am not(but most obviously could be) a government agent who is trying to send you to a honeypot link, just finding a random link on normal websites is more than likely not a honeypot link but I would never trust a link that I got from anyone on Tor.<br /><br />It&#039;s just an extra safety precaution as websites can use tools such as javascript, flash, ect in order to identify you.<br /><br />So say I was a government agent who signed up this account for the sole intent of investigating you. I could watch your threads and wait for you to ask for help, send you to a fake link which reveals your true IP or other identifying information.<br /><br />Again as another guy said it&#039;s just paranoia but better safe than sorry, safe than sorry, safe than sorry, safe than sorry.
