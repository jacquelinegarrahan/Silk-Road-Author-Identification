				There are hundreds out there, they&#039;re like goddamn pokemon, you gotta try em all! So what&#039;s your favorite strain? <br /><br />Mine:<br />White Widow - my favorite strain to vape, oh man good times.<br />Jupiter OG - best all around strain, I feel like you can smoke this for any occasion.<br />Bomb OG - so hard to find but one of my all time favorites, it&#039;s a really good way to relax after a hard day.

				Pretty much all of them.<br />I&#039;m not kidding either.<br />I would like to smoke as many strains as I can before I die.<br /><br />Give me a pound of crap swag Mexican.<br />I&#039;ll bake cookies ;)<br />And get baked.<br /><br />The biggest credit I&#039;ll give the SR vendors is very little CBD or burnt out THC.<br />No more red eyes, and I&#039;m still stoned.<br />Some of you growers are simply amazing.

				+1 on Sour D, definitely my favorite strain.<br /><br />I remember nearly a year ago I got a few g&#039;s of Sour Diesel Kush off Hashuk, hands down the best weed I&#039;ve ever had on Silk Road to date, and probably the most potent weed I&#039;ve ever smoked!

The buds where long and coiled like a snake and the bud was very dark green/brown with parts that where black! At first I thought it was burned and gonna be shit boy was I wrong that bud is tasty. Too bad he got fucked and they deported him back to ny then to jamaica :(

				The popular ones seem to be OG, Blueberry, White Widow and Sour D. Would anyone care enough to compare and contrast the four for me so I can figure out what to buy on my next pot purchase? (bought an &quot;unknown strain&quot; recently because of the price, but will definately save up to buy more once that&#039;s used up. I&#039;m looking for a more intellectual high, something trippy and interesting and unique and definately not something that might produce paranoia or anxiety (i&#039;ve had trouble with that in the past).

				Blueberry would be a good choice for the descriiption you posted. OG, Sour D, and White Widow are all a little heavier with Sour D being the more sativa like high, but still a hard hitter and gets stonier as the high progresses and more is smoked.<br /><br /><br />There are different Blueberries, so you should ask which one theirs is, because there I True Blueberry from DJ Short, and the original or maybe it is just called Blueberry from him, and the one you want is the original I believe which is more Sativa but very light, flavorful, and cerebral.<br /><br />Dutch Passion and almost every other seed company have copied his Blueberry, but you want a Blueberry that is from seed stock of DJ Short for guarenteed real Blueberry.

When I was a kid it used to be sticky as a wet weekend and left scissors unusable with resin,smoking it put the top of your head on the cieling. Awesome weed!<br />I had some about 2 months ago, still wrapped in the yellow and red cotton, but it was a weak head stoned and minimal body buzz. The bud looked exactly the same but it was dry, not sticky and much weaker smoke! What would change the potency in 16 odd years?
