				So, I&#039;ve been doing a lot of candy flipping lately (lsd+mdma) and I&#039;m starting to want a new experience and I&#039;m not sure what to try next. <br /><br />It would be nice if some of you guys can list your favorite combinations to give me an idea of what to try next.

				the just-fucked-up-but-not-really-having-fun combo I tried recently was 2c-b and mxe.<br /><br />MXE and pot work fine.<br /><br />MXE pot and booze is too much.<br /><br />Some MXE and some booze is almost too much, but I&#039;d rather smoke pot.<br /><br />DXM and three beers is terribly painful.<br /><br />Mushrooms and Pot are the best way to go.<br /><br />Mushrooms and 2c-b don&#039;t even work.<br /><br />Ritalin and Risperdol make you pass out for two straight days not &quot;hallucinate&quot; as your friend assured you.<br /><br />Those are all the combinations I&#039;ve tried.

				Lessee what I&#039;ve tried...<br /><br />Cannabis and Shrooms - Lovely lovely lovely, as I first felt the high within the shell of the trip, then they bled together and my thoughts and visuals kaleidoscoped like you wouldn&#039;t believe. Or maybe you would.<br />Cannabis, Shrooms, and Ecstasy (pill, unsure of exact makeup) - One of the most relaxing and spiritual experiences I&#039;ve had, shared just once with a dear, long-term friend. He created universes while God spoke through him and told me that before I&#039;m done, the whole world will know my name.<br />Cannabis and Acid - This combination is just... right. That&#039;s the best word for it.<br />Cannabis and MDMA - The cannabis helps me, personally, keep the experience more therapeutic and mellow rather than party mode, unless I&#039;m in a party circle with pieces going around.<br />Ketamine and Ecstasy (more unknown pills) - I danced my ass off for some 12 hours with breaks only to drink water, snort ketamine, and pop another pill or two as people at the rave house showered me with drugs. I was also doing handstands (feet braced against a ceiling beam) while everyone else partaking of ketamine was K-Holed pretty hard. I did 4.5 fat lines that night and took 3 or 4 pills.<br />Acid and MDA - I took 8 drops that were likely 70-80 mcg, and 130 mg of MDA. It was great at first, though the stimulation of the MDA was high for my taste, then I was ripped out of reality while still able to move, which was a horrible idea as I lost the concepts of time and consequence. Not trying that combination again.<br /><br />I should qualify my ketamine/ecstasy experience by saying I&#039;ve never K-Holed even on straight ketamine. After dissociating, I commit myself to re-associating with my body. The new association feels amazing, and forming it is like learning to use your body all over again. Seems more fun than K-Holing.
