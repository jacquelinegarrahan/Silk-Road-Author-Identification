				I liked them more as well. Personally I don&#039;t need/use thread subscription and a few of the other features so it was nice having both parts of the site integrated into one.

				I liked posting on the main site better myself, it just kept with the uniformity of the site, something that &quot;really tied the room together&quot; to quote TBL.&nbsp;

				With the new forum it makes finding and tracking stuff easier which I like but also if I find it easier, then LE would find it easier to track conversations and find information.&nbsp; The same goes for the SR site.&nbsp; Honestly its kludgy and crap compared to many off the shelf e-commerce products.&nbsp; But I like it as it gives you just enough tools to do what you want and you know it&#039;s not going to be compromised by known exploits in it.&nbsp; (eg. The mass Zen-Cart hack from earlier this year)

				I&#039;m glad to have the forum and marketplace separate. <br />Reduces the panic factor when SR goes down and allows SR to provide info while working on SR server. :D

				I prefer the new layout, but not the new headaches.&nbsp; Holding shift and refreshing pages to see posts show up is a bit annoying.&nbsp; But things like post count, search, and unread threads are incredibly useful and make the minor headache worth it.

				vbullshit is the worst forum software I have ever had the displeasure of using. I am a big fan of phpbb, punbb is nice quick and lightweight though. <br /><br />SMF is somewhere between vbullshit and punbb imo. The private messaging system sucks ass, but other than that it is fine, nothing exceptional though.&nbsp;

				Not me, again too many exploits, but mainly I just don&#039;t like the way it operates and looks. Oh well difference of opinion there :P. Personally if vbulliten and IPB weren&#039;t such exploit heavens I&#039;d like them both a lot more.

				I do not even know how people can complain.<br />We have a service that is illicit and free to use.&nbsp; You should just be grateful for what you have, no matter what form it is in.<br />And as for risks of exploits, well didnt you think about risk when coming on dark net?? 8)
