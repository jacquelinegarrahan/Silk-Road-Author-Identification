				Hey all.<br /><br />I&#039;m about to try out one tab of 25b, one tab of 25d, and two tabs of 25d (all 1 mg each). I&#039;ll be taking them bucally/sublingually/somewhere in my mouth.<br /><br />May or may not update this post as my journey progresses.<br /><br />Weeeee....<br /><br />Anybody have experience with anything similar?

				Blam. And I&#039;m back. That was something else. I don&#039;t even know where to begin...<br /><br />Glad to be spat back out on this niche of reality I can call my own.<br /><br />Have you ever considered that EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED (leave tangible fact behind, everyone you&#039;ve known, anything ever felt, , anything) has simply been an attempt by a set of dna-instructions to make more of itself? That&#039;s it, make of reality whatever you want, but when it comes down to it....

				I&#039;ve snorted 9.6mg of 25i once. Possibly the most retarded thing I&#039;ve ever done. Was an awesome trip though :D

				Damn. I can&#039;t even imagine where that took you.<br /><br />Curious, any negative side effects to report at such a high dose?

I&#039;ve discovered later that people have died from less than half that dose so I don&#039;t know if I got lucky or I simply have a robust serotonin system :D<br />I did see some crazy stuff though. Like translucent objects resembling water pipes but their surface resembled that of a soap bubble with all kinds of crazy colored patterns and reflections and those pipes were fucking everywhere! And at one point there was a tiny little dust particle on my white desk so I dashed it away with my hand and when I moved my hand away there suddenly were two dust particles. So I wiped those away too and they multiplied again. This proceeded until my whole desk looked like it hadn&#039;t been cleaned in years ;D<br />But the most fucked up thing was that at one point I could see my reflection in a wall like in a mirror with an uneven surface, as if the wall was silver-plated.<br />And, of course, I saw colorful fractal patterns on literally every surface. Crazy, crazy stuff :D
