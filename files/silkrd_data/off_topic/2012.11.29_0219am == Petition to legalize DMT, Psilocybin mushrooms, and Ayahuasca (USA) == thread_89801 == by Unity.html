				Check it out. One guy brought up the fact that religious peoples get to use psychedelics like these but regular people can&#039;t. <br /><br />https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/legalize-use-dmt-magic-mushrooms-and-mescaline-all-people/v2tTkGBB<br /><br />It needs like 24000 more signatures before December 15th or something. <br /><br />Think it&#039;ll pass? I think it&#039;s cool to see it but probably won&#039;t work.<br />If it does I&#039;m certainly going to finally put my shroom growing materials to use.

				LSD is a modern synthetic drug. The others have a history of thousands of years of safe use in Native American religious ceremonies.

The effects of LSD, mushrooms, and mescaline are very similar. DMT and Ayahuasca&nbsp; are mere hallucinogens, and have very little if any spiritual value.&nbsp; Personally I think if we could only legalise one psychedelic,&nbsp; it should be a spiritually valuable psychedelic such as LSD or mescaline, rather than a substance that merely produces very powerful hallucinations.

Whether you can obtain spiritual insight on a chemical depends on whether you&#039;re receptive to the way it communicates insight. I&#039;ve had spiritual experience on as little as a single puff of DMT. Five minutes of having semi-legit conversation with the entities that normally speak to me in half-formed compulsions. By semi-legit I mean I heard tiny machinery, little clicking and whirring, and an english translation bubbled up from my subconscious. At the end of it I asked for a breakthrough and I felt a rising energy somewhere in my head as I felt myself being pushed out of my body... then it passed and I was sober.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love DMT. I am aware that it can produce very powerful experiences.&nbsp; I just think there is a difference between spiritual experiences and experiences of sensory phenomena. Even if you regard the DMT entities as arising from some astral or extradimensional plane of existence, it&#039;s still a sensory experience. This other realm would itself be a part of some physical universe. LSD and mescaline also involve sensory phenomena, but there is another component of the trip which I&#039;ve never been able to experience on DMT, and that is the complete dissolution of the Self into a boundless universal consciousness that transcends space and time. It&#039;s not some identifiable &#039;entity&#039; that is recognised by the senses, but is an all-pervasive presence which transcends the senses and is immediately recognises as God. This is a pretty common experience on higher dosages of LSD. Leary, Watts, Huxley, Alpert, Grof, and others have written about it. I&#039;ve never experienced this on a DMT trip. Instead, I experience sensory and hallucinatory phenomena, which are fascinating, but I think must be carefully distinguished from spiritual experiences.

				A lot of people were excited about these petitions at first, because the government promised to answer the ones that got enough votes. One of the very first ones to receive enough votes was, of course, about legalizing marijuana. And a lot of people, including me, waited anxiously to see what their response would be. And it was, basically, &quot;Nah, we&#039;re good, it&#039;s cool.&quot;<br /><br />They don&#039;t even care that a lot of Schedule I drugs don&#039;t even meet the Schedule I criteria. For instance, it just doesn&#039;t correspond with reality to say that marijuana has 1.) a high potential for abuse 2.) no accepted medical use and 3.) a lack of accepted safety. Its potential for abuse is less than that of alcohol, its medical uses are many and well-established, and you basically *cannot* injure yourself with it.<br /><br />They just don&#039;t care about your well-reasoned argument or your evidence. They&#039;re mentally sick psychopaths.
