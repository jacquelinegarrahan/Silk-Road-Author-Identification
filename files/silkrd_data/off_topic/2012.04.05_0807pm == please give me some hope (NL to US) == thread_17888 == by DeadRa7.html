				Hi all-<br />I need some guidance...<br /><br />I ordered some MDMA from NL on march 21, FE on 22<br />Another member ordered same day<br />Im in Midwest, he was East coast<br />I chose &quot;priority&quot;, he chose &quot;international&quot; which is just regular post<br />He received his the week after<br />Two Weeks later, still haven&#039;t got mine<br />contacted vendor, he reshipped half my order <br /><br />Has anybody else experienced anything like this? Im assuming his order was sent the same time mine was, same packing, and he is a very well respected vendor (AA) <br /><br />Any possibility itll still come? Oh, and what should I do if customs actually has it? Should I be expecting feds breaking down my door? I only use tor on my Droid which has the latest security apps, without my password theres no way to gain access to my shit.<br /><br />I love this community, please help me out with this one my fellow silkroadians :)

				Lots of illicit shit comes out of NL, if customs have it they likely just destroyed it or swallowed it themselves. I wouldn&#039;t worry about a seizure unless you ordered a very large amount. If I were you though I would stay away from ordering international for a while. I would also take this as a lesson and stop finalizing early. There is nothing in it for you. Show your appreciation for your vendors by leaving good feedback and giving repeat business, not by putting yourself at risk.

				I ordered from schizofreen(Red Defqons{small order}), I was getting worried for a while be he didn&#039;t require me to finalize early, so not too much. Took 15 days to reach west coast, while the average is usually 10 days. If you order from schizo, the product is cleverly stealthed...

				As was mentioned earlier, if it&#039;s small and customs has it, I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. I would change your shipping info, get a new address if possible. I try to only purchase domestically but some of the products I want aren&#039;t supplied by vendors in my country. I just ordered from NL for the first time last week and am curious to see if it arrives or not. I&#039;m in North America and all my packages from north american vendors arrived so I may just stick to that even though NL is much cheaper.

When you check your mailbox and find it completely empty only knowing that its gonna be another fuckin&#039; 24 hours to most likely come back and find nothing? Yeah, story of my life, and its really starting to fuck with my psyche. <br /><br />There&#039;s a very well known trance artist coming to town this Friday and I remain hopeful that I will be able to get my package this week and roll my nuts off with a group of my closest friends and my girl<br /><br />Im a good person, kind to others and always pay my taxes on time- please let karma be to my advantage this time, oh international shipping gods!!

Iv heard 3jane has some pretty good K, i hope she restocks soon. Honestly Iv only done K a few times so its not like i can really tell good shit from bad.<br /><br />I talked to my NL vendor and he said he&#039;d reship the 1g sample. ( i ordered a 1g sample, then ordered 5g before the 1g showed up, despite my better judgement)<br /><br />I always see people say they asked for a reship, then two weeks later they get both packages! Do people normally pay for the reshipped package when this happens?<br />If it happens to me I too am going to pay for the reship package, I would feel bad for the vendor if he gave me two orders for the price of one just because i got a little impatient.

				Sometimes it takes a long time to get here. I&#039;ve ordered from several vendors at the start of March and only two out of four made it and its a month later. Even tho NL vendors try and make it get there, there is always a gamble.

				According to the Australian customs, the netherlands isn&#039;t actually that big for drugs to come from, Canada and a few other countries are the real problems. Maybe it&#039;s different in the US but I don&#039;t think you have anything much to worry about.
