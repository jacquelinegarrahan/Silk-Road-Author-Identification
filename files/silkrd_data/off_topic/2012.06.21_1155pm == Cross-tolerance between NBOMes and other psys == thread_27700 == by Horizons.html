				Title: <strong>Cross-tolerance between NBOMes and other psys</strong><br />

				Hey all!&nbsp; :D I have a few questions.<br /><br />I like to think of myself as an experienced psychedelic user - something I&#039;m prouder of than I should be - , but I&#039;m new to NBOMe compounds (which are new themselves, having only popped up a few years ago). I&#039;ve only taken 25i-NBOMe on about five occasions, and it seems to behave very differently from every other psychedelic I&#039;ve ever taken in regards to tolerance.<br /><br />The drug seems to be extremely sensitive to tolerance buildup, either from previous NBOMe use or cross-tolerance from other psys. From my experience, it seems that ten days after tripping on X amount of 2ci-NBOMe, or an &quot;equivalent&quot; amount of, say, 2c-b, I&#039;d need about double the dose of 2ci-NBOMe to get comparable effects. Compare that to LSD, for instance, to which I have no noticeable tolerance at all after a week, unless I had been using regularly for a while, or the last trip had been very strong (upwards of 600 mics). It&#039;s a much higher tolerance, and it takes a lot longer to subside.<br /><br />To my non-biochemist mind, it seems like this is a property of the drug that makes it more susceptible to the tolerance mechanisms of my body, and so the effect would only present itself if NBOMe were the latter drug in the sequence. But I&#039;m not 100% sure that this doesn&#039;t work both ways, and would rather not waste more expensive drugs to find out when I can maybe count on somebody else&#039;s previous experience.<br /><br />My question, therefore, is thus: Does tripping on an NBOMe compound create a cross-tolerance with other psychedelics that is heavier and/or longer-lasting than usual, or than what one should expect from that other psychedelic&#039;s self-tolerance?<br /><br />I&#039;d also like to throw in a bonus question: 25i-NBOMe gave me some great visuals, but almost zero of the psychedelic headspace, even on 1100 micrograms (which according to erowid is a high enough dose that I should be actually tripping and not just seeing pretty colors). Are any of the other NBOMe compounds more similar to classic phenethylamines in mental effects? Ideally, I&#039;m looking for something similar to 2c-e, which is quite possibly my second favorite psychedelic after the Holy Grail that is DMT.
