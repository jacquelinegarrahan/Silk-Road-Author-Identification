				I&#039;ve always been proud to be a Brit. I love my country, weather is terrible, but I don&#039;t like being too hot anyway. Living up north (North side of England) I&#039;ve gotten use to the crappy weather.<br /><br />However, Nick Clegg needs to take that dildo out of his arse and stop speaking shit, making promises that he can&#039;t keep.

				Dude, just see it as an excuse to party if you hate it that much.<br /><br />Sure, we had no choice in being born here but whatever, that&#039;s not going to change, and it remains Britain, you may as well make the most of it. It&#039;s a good chance for people to actually have good will for each other instead of acting like twats. <br /><br />We all know politics is bullshit, we all know society is corrupt, we all know that the laws are literally insane in certain cases and aren&#039;t based in anything like reality.. none of that is going to change any time soon, so you may as well enjoy the show.

				I&#039;m only half British, spent half my life living in thailand (where i had my first j&nbsp; ;D ), why would you not be proud to be british? Sure there&#039;s shit weather, stupid laws and full of some complete dicks but man, free healthcare, great quality of life and the country has massive history. Enjoy man, until you go to somewhere worse you will always think England is shit, just live it!

Also, your use of the English language and grammar is really turning me off from writing anything intellectually stimulating. &quot;British&quot; is quite a broad word, there are Scottish people who have their own culture, Irish, Welsh and English too and they all are different from one another, but they are part of Britain. They also have their own languages. However, we all would agree that the English language and culture is the dominate one in Britain.&nbsp; This is where the comedy begins. I know immigrants with better grasp of the English language than yo&#039; &quot;I&#039;m proud to be British&quot; ass. You so proud, yet you can barely write a coherent sentence with an language of the country you are so proud of. <br /><br />As for the point you missed, and probably will miss again. Why would you be proud of something you had no control over. To say, we should make the most out of it and to say I am proud to be British or whatever place your mum pissed you out, is two different things. Completely two different things you cognitively challenged muthafucker. I agree to make the best out of it, we have places to educate ourselves, better ourselves, provide for our families, go out and play with our love ones without being bombed or shot, among millions of other things compared to places like Somalia, Palestine, certain South American countries and dozen of other poor countries.&nbsp; To invest a piece of yourself cause you fell out of a pussy on point x, y or z is foolish. What did you? Nothing. You fell out of a pussy, that is all you did and you take pride in that? <br /><br />I am proud to be a child of the universe, something that has been here before man started naming things and assigning ownership out of ego and foolishness. I&#039;ll piss on every single flag, even if it means getting my head cut off.

				sixteenpointfive you made no point to begin with.<br />And as for your telling everyone else that their grammar and use of the english language is shit, most people here who speak the language would point out to the sentence you used &quot;yet you can barely write a coherent sentence with an language of the country you are so proud of. &quot;<br />Sorry, but most would say &quot;a language&quot;, not &quot;an language&quot;<br />Again, your just using this as an excuse to either make yourself look incredibly impressive or you think you are a cut above the rest.<br />Either way, since when was the internet a place for grammatical correctness?<br />Your just picking out holes in an argument you know you wont win.<br />A child of the universe? If that were true then you would respect other follow beings in their beliefs. <br />However, i think you come across as a child who believes in himself, and nothing more.
