				OK I got my first weed order through the mail and I have a few questions. I hope this hasn&#039;t been covered 100 times before but I haven&#039;t seen it if it has.<br /><br />1st: It was very well vacuum sealed and the weed is flatter then a pancake (like 1/4in thick in most places).

				Hi High Friend (heh),<br /><br />1st: I&#039;m unsure for personal amounts as I only ever buy bulk, and internationally at that, so the buds I receive are always compressed to some degree, but speaking with your vendor about looser vacuum packing may be an option (this will decrease security to a degree, and not all vendors will be willing to do that.)<br /><br />2nd: If you take a read through this topic: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=656.msg111446#msg111446 you&#039;ll find the method (with accompanying photos) to fluff up your buds!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

This breaks the trichomes exposing the THC to air and degradation = schwag. Not to mention smashing the weed makes it smell more in the mail.<br /><br />If you order from me, I put your buds in a hard container and then vacuum seal the hard container. Trichomes come intact, thus THC levels are still high and you can&#039;t smell a thing.<br /><br />And no, there&#039;s no way to &quot;un-squish&quot; it. You&#039;re like everyone else where I live - you want buds that don&#039;t look like shit. If you want those kinds of buds you can order from me.

				To be perfectly honest Mister Dank, you have no proof either way. You should certainly place a caveat of &quot;In my opinion&quot; preceding your comments. Giving your argument more weight than should ever be attributed to it, for argument&#039;s sake, if most of the top vendors here are LE and people buy enough off you to make you one of the top vendors then won&#039;t that, by your logic and to brand new buyers, bring the possibility that YOU are LE?<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to be aggressive or insulting here, not in the least, but you really need to look into getting help / self-medicating for paranoid tendencies.<br />Methods that compress weed for stealthy sending do not a Law Enforcement Officer make.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Speaking of stealthy sending, do you sell bulk? I think you&#039;d have a very hard time sending bulk amounts disguised as documents for stealth purposes if they&#039;re in a hard container.. A stack of documents will usually bend.. A hard container won&#039;t. It&#039;ll also need to be thin enough to look like documents.. Can you get, say, 4 Oz to me without them being compressed, and still looking like documents?<br /><br />Hmmm.. Then again... What if I&#039;M LE..? In truth, yes, there is a possibility that everyone on here is a member of law enforcement agencies. Every. single. person. It&#039;s possible, though not plausible - just like your initial argument, funnily enough.<br />Even if the odds are a billion to one against, an idea can still be *possible*, but there has to be a modicum of actual believability for something to be plausible.<br /><br />High Friend, I&#039;ve been ordering bulk amounts of green for over 6 months from some of the top weed vendors here. With the necessary precautions, you can&#039;t really go wrong ordering from them.&nbsp; :)<br />Mister Dank may come back and imply that I&#039;m a law enforcement officer colluding with the top vendors in order to lull buyers into a false sense of security - possible, yes, though not exactly plausible. Most people here are just regular people like yourself looking to get high or make some profit, or both. Always stay within escrow, always do your research on the forums, and always go with your gut instinct - you&#039;ll be just fine!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Domestic weed maybe crushed a little but not flat.<br />No reason.<br />So complain you your vendor about packing methods.<br /><br />Non domestic comes flatten for a reason.<br />You are told this in the description, or the many threads here.<br />We break it up and put orange peel, or lettuce in a jar with the compressed bud.<br />24 hours and they will loosen enough.<br /><br />I was down at the police station, and the local boys said thats&nbsp; how they do it. ::)<br />

				Many vendors do offer solutions to this<br /><br />For example one I remember used these cardboard boxes and they where vac&#039;d <br /><br />Also some use these metal sealed bags that dont have to suck the air out but keep the smell out well enough, they probably wipe it down with ISO Alcohol after too. <br /><br />But unless you are planning on dealing the weed I dont see the problem, its the same weight, grinds up the same..

				I&#039;ve received several QPs from different vendors and I&#039;ve had 100% success ratings and no doors being kicked in. No amount of studying can guarantee you&#039;re safe because anyone can be compromised at any time but there&#039;s a lot to say about doing your homework on your vendors.
