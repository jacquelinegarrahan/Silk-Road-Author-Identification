				I&#039;ve only bought from buy-jwh.com to get MXE. Its still in the mail, but my tracking number is working. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m wondering what sites on the clearnet will let me buy MXE/other legal RC&#039;s. Note, I&#039;m in the US, so they must ship to the USA.<br /><br />If you have a good site, post the link below. Please only recommend a site you or a close friend has used successfully No one likes getting ripped off..<br /><br />Thanks for any new sites!

				All the good forums that are worth a damn are 100 percent private now. The RC scene is fucked unless you can get by with word of mouth. Good luck.

				Quite frankly. FUCK RC&#039;S. They ruined a lot of drug scenes and caused me to have to kick some ass after being betrayed by my own family. Yeah, fuck RC scammers. I stick with the real shit. My health is not worth random chemicals. Maybe 2C-B and X, but other than that fuck it.

				When RC stops being RC and becomes regular drug? Like AMT been around for ages and it&#039;s still considered RC..<br /><br />On topic:<br />http://arc-research.net/ - made multiple orders, zero problems so far. I&#039;m pretty sure someone is reselling their stuff on SR for double or triple the price.

				i&#039;ve rather enjoyed the couple of rc&#039;s i&#039;ve tried.&nbsp; 2c-i and mxe.&nbsp; mxe even moreso than some &quot;real drugs&quot; i&#039;ve done over the years.&nbsp; 2c-i was ok by itself, but if you take 15-20mgs with your x pills, it&#039;s an amazing candy flip.&nbsp; it really intensifies the roll.&nbsp; better visuals, more body sensation.&nbsp; but i can see why people don&#039;t like them.&nbsp; there are a lot of dirt bag street dealers that pass them off as something else, and that can be very dangerous.&nbsp; <br /><br />maybe i&#039;m old fashioned, but there should be more ethical drug dealers, who know and explain their products, and won&#039;t sell to people that will be retarded with them.&nbsp; when i sold, i always taste tested my product before i put it out there.&nbsp; if anybody was going to be harmed, it would be me.&nbsp; and i refused to sell certain products to certain people, for whatever reason.&nbsp; i was the friendly neighborhood drug dealer, not a street thug serving fiends.<br />
