				One of my mates is pretty huggy IRL but straight (as far as I&#039;m aware). Anyway we are more party mates i.e. see each other when we&#039;re out and get on it. Anyway, he popped up in one of my dreams last night and he was trying to get into bed with me. I felt he was trying to do this to get some gear off me. I was def not into it and told him nicely to bugger off. <br /><br />Anyway, I know it&#039;s just a dream but it&#039;s made me feel pretty awkward about him now. Weird right?

				They say some dreams can reveal our deepest darkest desires ;D. Seriously though, it&#039;s just a dream, bro. Weird, weird, weird shit happens in dreams, most of the time we don&#039;t even remember them, so I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve had even weirder ones.

				For real though, we live in the fucking 21st century mate, nothing wrong with experimenting with something other than drugs. Drop some molly, get the bisexual shit out of your system and realize how much time your wasting dreaming about dudes when you could be thinking about...oh I don&#039;t know boobs and the taste of vaginas and whatnot. I&#039;m no psychologist but if I had to take a guess I&#039;d say you&#039;re probably just really young, horny, and take drugs that make your peepee feel funny around other young and horny individuals. ;D

				In view of your obvious repressed homosexuality, you may want to think about redefining your sexual preferences and removing yourself from that closet.
