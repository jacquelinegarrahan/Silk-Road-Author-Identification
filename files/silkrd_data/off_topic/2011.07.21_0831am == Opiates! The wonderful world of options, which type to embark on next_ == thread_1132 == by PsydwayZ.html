				Gday,<br /><br />As i watch the list of opiates on SR go up and down with various listed choices i wonder to myself which would be the best one to choose next?<br /><br />I&#039;m a long time codeine user via CWE method and occasionally i go one better and get straight to the point with morphine whenever i stumble upon it. Sometimes i will prepare opium in a tea..<br /><br />I hear a lot about china white and black tar etc and all the variations of generic morphine/methadone etc...<br /><br />Id like to pick the brains of the loyal users of above mentioned chemicals too see what the best bang for buck or most decent high would be if one was to purchase from the listings in sr?<br /><br />My methods of admin would be mostly orally and smoked. Im going to give im and iv a miss as i know i will take a liking to it too much. I am told to stay away if you have never done it before.<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated..<br /><br />Time to explore opiates some more!!<br /><br />Cheers

				My current favorite right now is roxicet (roxicodone), and before they were almost completely eliminated here in the US, oxycontin (the ones with OC on the pill - not that OP bullshit), both gave me and my girl energy and nice buzz. Hydrocodone gives a nice buzz as well, but more of a relaxed one for me. Recently ate some tramadol for the first time, had to eat 2-3 50mg - but it was a low-end buzz that i would do again. Never tried black tar, or &quot;china white&quot;, stuff i got was sandy-brownish colored - nodded me the fuck out.<br /><br />BTW, all of these i either insufflated or just ate. My rule of thumb is, if it has less than 50% of the narcotic mixed with another non-narcotic (i.e. hydrocodone/apap), i dont snort it. But i got friends that will basically snort anything (like ozzy).

				im not sure on exactly which but i hear a decent antihistamine will help control the itching, promethazine (sominex) possibly? i once did 300mg codeine but it didnt seem to have much effect on me at all aside from the fact that the caffiene stays in with cwe too so i was twitchy and wired for the evening, guess i could be one of the unlucky 10% on whom codeine doesnt work, guess id have to go straight to the morphine/opium to get anything from it

I don&#039;t have a habit now but I almost lost my life to opiates.&nbsp; I first starting using heroin to come down from coke, eventually gave up the coke.&nbsp; Just be careful, opiates are fun but can easily take over. I don&#039;t do many opiates now, just a few roxies now and then or to come down from coke<br /><br />Benadryl or any antihistamine with Diphenhydramine will help with itching but it&#039;s also a good Codeine potentiator. That just means it makes it stronger, many prescription opiods have potentiators that you can take to increase the effects, you can google them.&nbsp; Personally never thought potentiators did much for me I would&nbsp; just take more drugs and not worry about them but some people swear by them so might be worth checking out especially with something like codeine.

				I think what he meant was that roxicet is basically a percocet made by roxane labs, roxycodone is roxane&#039;s trade name for oxycodone IR.<br /><br />Roxicet contains APAP, roxicodone does not.&nbsp; Roxicet does not contain apap.<br /><br />In general a roxy is 30% pure but I see what you mean you are talking active vs inactive pain killer, not inactive binders.<br /><br />Taking the step up from lortab or even percocet to sniffables is a leap.&nbsp; You just dont realize it until you do the math 6 months later and go &quot;fuck this is 27 percocets worth, I&#039;m fucked&quot;<br />

				Hmmm I have no clue.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen opium in real life but will admit I&#039;ve never sought it out online.&nbsp; &nbsp; Without any trip reports or advice from people you trust I&#039;d ask the vendor.&nbsp; If that don&#039;t work the only thing you can do is try to gauge from the price what you think it might be and start small working up.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know the consistancy of real opium, isn&#039;t it like a super sticky black substance?<br /><br />This guy isn&#039;t selling you dragon bloods incense aka &quot;Redrock opium&quot; is he?&nbsp; If that&#039;s the case you throw it all in or throw it down the toilet it&#039;ll have the same effect.<br /><br />There has to be someone who has actually tried real opium out there.&nbsp; I always just figured that if they could produce opium they can take it all the way to H so it would be hard to find and rare.&nbsp; If it&#039;s real it almost makes me wish I used still to be able to try the fucking original gangster of them all.<br /><br />Let me know how it feels.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				the seller also sells heroin acquired from the same source, supposed to be the real deal and his h certainly gets the reviews, im not going down that road, at least not yet anyway but it leads me to believe its going to be the real deal, i should be able to tell you very soon (more on that once its sorted, but it again leads me to believe the vendor is legit)

				Ok, being an opiate vendor, i will give you my take on it.<br /><br />if your DOC is Codeine, and you are looking for the next step... dont jump to far. there are a few factors to take in account..<br /><br />1) if you are NOT opiate tolerant, jumping to a strong med like oxy/roxy can be dangerous, so be safe and do your research. if its your first time with any opiates,(not you in particular, just in general), DO NOT snort a 80mg oxycontin!! you may hurt yourself! they are time release and when crushed and snorted all at once, you will intake all 80mg at once... for a person that takes 15mg 4 times a day, that will probably give them a buzz and thats about it.&nbsp; <br />2) once you do make that step up the opiate ladder, you most likely wont go back to codeine.. so if i were you, maybe start with Lortab/Lorcet then Percocet before i would go with Roxicodone or any harder drugs..<br /><br />Also only take a few at a time and give yourself 2-3 days between taking them for recreational purposes.. it will slow down the dependencies.. and believe you me, Dopesick sux<br /><br />PS... Opium Rocks!
