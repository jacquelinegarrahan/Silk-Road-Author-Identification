				Very interesting stuff, I watched the first two vids but don&#039;t know what to make from them. Do&nbsp; you think that Toole is blinking every second on purpose? Could it be some kind of hypnosis-technique he is using on us and we respond subconsciously?<br /><br />Gonna watch the long vid tomorrow, too tired for that now.

				well, I tried to let go today, what happend was I fell 5m off the climbing wall into the safety rope ;)<br /><br />I consciously realized my ego, or my fear-voice, for the first time today. It is that little sucker that keeps whispering: What if your belayer fucks up? What if the rope fails? What if you want to put the rope into the safety and slip while having 6m of lose rope?<br /><br />Little asshole :P <br /><br />I tried to calm me down by breathing deeply and slowly and by embracing the moment. I tried to realize what I was seeing at the moment, eg. the wall, the rope, which colors the holds were etc. That helped a little.

				What Tolle is talking about is ego death. For me the involuntary experience of ego death imprinted itself so powerfully upon my memory, that I can now evoke the same state of consciousness by an act of will. I don&#039;t need LSD any more. I don&#039;t even need to meditate. This, I believe, is the cure for depression, but it can also be dangerous; if you are not suffering from depression, I see no particular reason to desire it. The danger is not physical or necessarily psychological, but existential and spiritual. Ego death deprives you of the illusion of free will. You watch yourself as if you are in autopilot. It&#039;s as if you are a puppet whose strings are being pulled by some higher consciousness.

				I practiced letting go for two weeks now, the results are pretty awesome. I can not induce this state of mind on purpose yet, but sometimes, I just am. This is the best way to describe it. I just watch things happen, without judging them, without judging me, without any need to do something. That is pure bliss.

				Sorry for bumping an old thread.&nbsp; I can relate to many things in this thread.&nbsp; If this topic is important to you or you have suffered this I IMPLORE you to read this entire post.<br /><br />This thread brings both joy and trepidation.&nbsp; I believe it&#039;s very possible for a person to be possessed by a spirit and those that would possess us(rather than minister to us or guide us) don&#039;t have our best interest in mind.&nbsp; I&#039;m nervous when I read people describing &#039;letting go&#039; and &#039;just watching things happen&#039;.&nbsp; After a person &#039;lets go&#039; you see them post things like <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You watch yourself as if you are in autopilot. It&#039;s as if you are a puppet whose strings are being pulled by some higher consciousness. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> lead me to believe there may be possession occurring here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What makes you believe the consciousness pulling your strings is &#039;higher&#039;?<br /><br />I fully believe that this IS spiritual.&nbsp; Spirituality is such a global concept and has been for millenia.&nbsp; There is NO way it&#039;s just myth or imagined.&nbsp; As science improves it&#039;s disproving myths, but not the bible.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never experienced ego death, even on extremely heroic doses of psychedelic cocktails.&nbsp; I believe this is because there is ego death is the experience of being removed from yourself and the control being taken over by another.. Demonic Possession.&nbsp; Also, When described, people say you need to &#039;let go&#039; and &#039;go along with it&#039; and allow it to run it&#039;s course&#039; or &#039;take you were it wants to go&#039;.&nbsp; These are all statements that are similar to things the bible warns about.&nbsp; I&#039;m of the opinion that ego death is actually demonic possession and that I can&#039;t experience that as I have a higher power living inside of me(invited in)<br /><br />You&#039;ll notice how people say they didn&#039;t ask for the experience of ego death.&nbsp; For instance, <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90989.msg645200#msg645200">Quote from: use LSD with caution on December 05, 2012, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What Tolle is talking about is ego death.

It&#039;s as if you are a puppet whose strings are being pulled by some higher consciousness.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Notice the &#039;INVOLUNTARILY experience of ego death&#039;?&nbsp; This is because demonic possession isn&#039;t USUALLY something people ask for or invite(knowingly).<br /><br />You need to keep a tight rein on yourself and be in control.&nbsp; Would you willingly let something else CONTROL your life? That&#039;s the beautiful thing about the Bible, it shows us how despite the trouble it causes, God sees it as important for us to have personal choice because He wants a relationship with us, not a bunch of robots.&nbsp; He&#039;s willing to provide guidance but specifically warns to be in control of yourself mentally and physically.<br /><br />I&#039;m nervous that these videos may be setting the stage/prepping you subconsciously to &#039;let go&#039; and open yourself to outside influences. There is talk of hypnosis as well as other things on this page.&nbsp; I think there&#039;s something to be said for mind over matter but honestly we were made with the ability to experience these emotions(if we evolved surely we&#039;d have done away with these &#039;weaknesses&#039; generations ago).&nbsp; Why do you think these emotions are unhealthy.&nbsp; Maybe there&#039;s a good reason you feel this way.&nbsp; Maybe the depression is the effect, not the cause.<br /><br />Try some vitamin D and some christian counseling at your local Christian church.&nbsp; I&#039;d recommend a 4 square denomination or calvary chapel.&nbsp; God Bless you all!

For those who must hide among Christians, the concept is referred to as a &quot;Guardian angel&quot; in cases where the guardian angel intervenes and speaks to you.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been studying the ancient teachings referring to daemons (spiritual teachers) for a very long time, and although I do not conform to the rules and guidelines of LeVayan Satanism, I have read a lot about it, and have studied it to some extent.<br /><br />For those of you who do not know what LeVayan Satanism is, it&#039;s basically extreme fierce individualism taking to its logical conclusion.<br /><br />According to LeVay, you are an individual, and rather than worshiping an external god, you worship yourself, only. LeVay teaches us that we should constantly strive to improve ourselves, define and refine ourselves, and become the gods we wish we were.<br /><br />I have also studied Chaos Magic and Discordianism.<br /><br />Chaos Magic is more of a meta-spiritualism than any particular denomination of paganism. Chaos Magic holds that belief systems are a tool, and teaches us how to use these tools more effectively. Chaos Magic teaches us that you can always change who you are, change your beliefs, and change the world around you by doing so.<br /><br />Discordianism teaches us that you should never take anything too seriously, and resembles Absurdist Zen in that only when confronted with the absurd can we achieve enlightenment. Discordianism teaches that you cannot study wisdom from any book or guru, and you cannot communicate it to others secondhand; it must be observed directly, and presenting yourself with the absurd can help you observe reality for what it is.<br /><br />I hope that helps.

				It&#039;s an interesting topic. I think I am a bit odd in that I sort of realize the world through whatever context I choose to while other people seem to react to the world through whatever context they have been trained to. I was once, long ago, in a position where I was fairly confident that I was going to end up in prison for some legal issues I ran into. I spent about a day reacting to the whole deal before I took a sip of coffee and came to the conclusion that whatever was going to happen would happen and a good deal of that was out of my control leaving me with a profound understanding that what was in my control was how I was going to receive those new circumstances. <br /><br />I decided that since I love new adventures and stories, prison would actually be an interesting fork in the road for me. I accepted the fact that if it happened there was no reason to go around being miserable about it and instead I could look forward to telling stories about doing time and the lessons I would learn from it.<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty sure that was the turning point for me in my life. I came to terms with the fact that there are some things I can control and I do my best to move those things in favor of a life I want and there are other things that are outside of my control and it&#039;s up to me if I choose to experience those things as good or bad. Sometimes I find I like being miserable, it adds character and makes being happy all the more fun, but I never surrender to my emotions since they are nothing more than a decision we all get to make if only we appreciate that the one thing in life we can control is how we look at the world.

A therapist visited the class, and administered a &quot;locus of control quiz.&quot;<br /><br />Guess who got the highest score for internal locus of control? The teacher! I was second only to the teacher.<br /><br />All of the other students had external loci of control, the teacher and I were on the other side of the scale by far.<br /><br />There was a huge gulf between the teacher and I and the one who was third in line.<br /><br />This idea that believing that you cannot control your own fate is not unique. In fact, it is extremely common.<br /><br />ALL of the other students in that class believed they did not control their own fate, and that there really wasn&#039;t anything they could do about it.

				Yeah it&#039;s always been one of those things that confused me with people. They get trapped in their trained reflexes never stopping to appreciate that they are the ones who get to dictate their reactions to the world rather than the other way around. I normally try to stop myself from commenting on posts about depression because my view on it is so similar to a SNL skit I saw years ago that went something like this:<br /><br />&quot;Doctor, I get terrified when I go out in public, the world seems to close in on me, my heart starts racing and I begin to panic.&quot;<br /><br />The doctor looks intently at the patient, takes his one dollar fee and then says:<br /><br />&quot;Stop doing that.&quot;<br /><br />For me, and I imagine some folks out there, it really is that easy. If I don&#039;t want to be depressed I stop focusing on the depressing thoughts. If I want to loose weight I stop eating like shit and get off my ass. If I want a beautiful girlfriend I start talking to beautiful girls. I think ultimately it just comes down to confidence (or more likely arrogance), in that I firmly believe that I am the master of my mind. The world is a show that will play on with or without me but my realization, interpretation and reaction to that show is entirely up to me.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve been progressively dropping superficiality from my life over the last decade or two. I came the conclusion that the only thing that a man who has everything is left to want is nothing. I literally gave away a 6500 sqf house, my cars and motorcycles, quit a high six figure job, packed a few important belongings up in the back of my SUV and became a travailing vagabond some 12 years ago. I stopped trying to be the guy that every girl wanted and instead started approaching relationships with the following disclaimer:<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m not a boyfriend or a husband, I have no desire to do anything anyone else thinks I should, I tend to fall in love completely but enjoy it so much I rarely limit myself to one person, I look at the world through a child&#039;s perspective and have no intention of growing up or becoming more mature, my only redeeming quality is that I can do anything I want and right now I want to be with you.&quot;<br /><br />Since adopting the above creed I&#039;ve met the love of my life and have never felt richer or more satisfied. I think my self induced suffering was brought about less by failing at life and more so by succeeding at trying to live someone else&#039;s dreams.<br /><br />Happy that being gay helps you avoid some of the drama on this side of the fence but I&#039;m sure there is plenty of crazy stuff to deal with on your side too. Honestly I think I&#039;m somewhere in the middle myself. My girl is about as butch as they come but we manage to compliment each other perfectly. I realized a while back that if she was a guy I would still be totally in love with that person, which I think is the way it&#039;s supposed to be. Sex, at least for me, is not so much about the stuff we hide in our pants as much as it is the connection we share with the person we are having it with.

				This is kinda&#039; how I beat anxiety/panic disorders.<br /><br />I always began to panic if simple things happened like my heart race increased, or if I started getting warm or the likes - and then one day I just said to myself: <br /><br />&quot;If I die - then I die, there is nothing I can do about that&quot;<br /><br />And slowly, the panic and anxiety disappeared. It was amazing.
