				Ok, so I&#039;m new here so forgive me if this is redundant as I haven&#039;t seen anything that touches on this topic and it appears that a lot of people have no clue how to deal with a troll here as most people argue with them and try to have actual conversations with him. Crazy! So I&#039;ve gotta touch on it. <br /><br />In regards to the troll:<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious. It&#039;s so obvious to me that there is a really good troll amongst us on almost all threads. I&#039;m not going to say the name, since that is part of his troll, but if you even spend 10 minutes on the forums you&#039;ll know who I&#039;m talking about always saying extreme theories ect. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve gotta ask, do you guys understand what a troll is and what they try to achieve? Trolls want you to argue, debate, and their sole purpose is to get a reaction out of you!!!<br />The rules of the internet states it like this &quot;14. Do not argue with trolls â€” it means that they win.&quot;<br /><br />^^^ this is a basic rule of the internet. There are guidelines set out for dealing with these annoying twerps. If you haven&#039;t ever heard the saying &quot;Don&#039;t feed the trolls&quot; learn what it means. It means don&#039;t argue or even respond to trolls. If you must respond, tell the troll to go back under their bridge. The troll on this board is eating this stuff up and he most likely doesn&#039;t believe in a thing he&#039;s saying. That&#039;s part of the troll too! Learn your meme. Ignore the troll completely because a lot of you are getting wrapped up into each one of his trolls and he gets off on that, he wins when you don&#039;t just ignore him. Act like he doesn&#039;t exist!<br /><br />Google rules of the internet if you have to.<br /><br />That is all. I just lost this round with the troll, but I needed to cast some light for some of the people who don&#039;t understand trolling so maybe he&#039;ll disappear. I hope that helps some of you as he&#039;s causing some of you a lot of grief and stress it seems like. I&#039;ve seen some tempers get real short and it&#039;s just a play on his part. Annoying. <br />Cheers and love fam!
