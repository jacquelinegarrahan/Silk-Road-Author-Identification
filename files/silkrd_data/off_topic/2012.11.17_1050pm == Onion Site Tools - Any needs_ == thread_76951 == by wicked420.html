				Hello everyone,<br /><br />I joined this community a little over a year ago, when SR was going through major changes, with separating the forums to the new site, and the news articles brought in huge growth etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />During that time, everyone was still trying to get setup on PGP/GPG and there were a lot of brand new users to TOR in general.&nbsp; It was during that time, that I threw up my own onion in order to compile guides and help people get setup and started in the world of TOR.&nbsp; <br /><br />I created http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/&nbsp; to host guides, and built a few tools as well.&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; a GPG encryption test tool, that allows you to test and see if you&#039;re encrypting messages correctly.&nbsp; and 2) I created a database to store all of my contact info on, so that I could reliably keep my public key stored somewhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />All that being said, my question now is:&nbsp; Is there a demand for any other simple tools to help people remain safe?&nbsp; &nbsp;My little onion, in just over a year is getting over 1000 hits a day of people learning how to use PGP, and testing their setup.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad the little tools I built are being used and referenced.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I would like to expand my small knowledge of PHP and webdev and build some other simple quick tools to help people.&nbsp; Some thoughts below:<br /><br />While I dont want to necessarily host images, I&#039;m thinking of creating an image METADATA scrubber, to remove all the hidden personal information in pictures/videos/etc.&nbsp; Basically you upload a picture to my site, and it cleans all your metadata, and lets you redownload it, all cleaned up.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I could also do a privnote type tool as well, but really dont want to store any personal information , even for a small period of time,&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I want that level of responsibility.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any thoughts/suggestions would be lovely!<br /><br />Thanks -<br />wicked420

				StExo - This is what ive got setup so far, I&#039;ll add a rolling log soon, and make it so it caches for a while, but for now, i&#039;ve got it so you can at least test a site: http://p3lr4cdm3pv4plyj.onion/updown/<br /><br />and damaged - very true, i dont want to be responsible for/with any personal information at all. so maybe i wont do that at all. thanks for input!<br /><br />
