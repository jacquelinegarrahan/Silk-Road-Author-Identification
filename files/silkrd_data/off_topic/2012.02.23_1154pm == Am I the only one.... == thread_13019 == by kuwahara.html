				...who hasn&#039;t even heard of some of these drugs.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t even know what to do with half of them!<br /><br />Maybe I am just too old.&nbsp; It was acid+speed, the E when I was younger.&nbsp; Then more traditional drugs.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t even spell what half of you lot are buying.&nbsp; :o

				I also grew up with the basics and only heard legends of some of the more exotic drugs from my friends.&nbsp; Vague stories of concerts and festivals two states over where the &quot;designer drugs&quot; never managed to find their way back home.&nbsp; &nbsp;Happy that I found SR and can finally satisfy my curiously,

				Some of these name make me wonder if people even want to bother making names or if they&#039;re just in a rush to make drugs haha<br />Seriously though, a lot drugs on here just have scientific names, their are many, many longer and more &quot;designer&quot; drugs than what I&#039;ve seen

				Yeah. I wandered onto SR and saw the 2C family and a bunch of other things and thought, &quot;what are these? Supplements?&quot; It never ocurred to me that there were psychedelics outside of the obvious shrooms, LSD, etc.<br /><br />Now I&#039;ve spent a lot of time researching every drug listed on here, mostly on erowid. Lot of it is fascinating stuff.
