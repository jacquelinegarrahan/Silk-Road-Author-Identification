				I like McDonald&#039;s.&nbsp; So I decided I&#039;m going to go there 47 more times and then never set foot in it again.<br /><br />Seriously -- what&#039;s your logic here?&nbsp; Do you think there&#039;s some sort of escalating risk if you keep buying here?&nbsp; Your risk is exactly the same on the thousandth transaction as it was on the first -- and I figure that risk is pretty low compared to other common ways of buying illegal drugs.&nbsp; Unless you intend to quit buying drugs altogether after X purchases, leaving a (relatively) safe market for another one only widens your footprint and _increases_ your risk.<br /><br />I intend to keep using Silk Road as long as it&#039;s the best place for certain things I want to buy.&nbsp; I&#039;d really like to hear why you intend to do otherwise.

				&nbsp;My plan is one and only, I ordered on 420. I have a terrible history with hard drugs....&nbsp; so I don&#039;t wanna fall back in to it. It&#039;s been almost 7 years and I figured I&#039;d treat myself to some K (my old fave) for my birthday. I must admit I am finding the forums highly addicting. Also my fiance is pretty interested in vending (just green),&nbsp; &nbsp;not really fond of the idea, but he has been researching. lol.

				When I first discovered SR I figured I&#039;d make a couple decent sized purchases and then be done with it... Ha!! I&#039;ve pretty much drained all my savings of several thousand dollars... oops!!&nbsp; Hell, I would have spent it all on drugs anyway if I had local hookups IRL! It&#039;s easy to get on here and just go crazy because you can find anything you could want! It is a blessing AND a curse...

				I came here planning for it to be a one time deal, buy a few e pills to save for special occasions since I couldn&#039;t find any locally. Bought a small amount of shrooms to test the waters and they ended up being my new DOC and I come back to buy more every couple of weeks. I don&#039;t plan on stopping.

I don&#039;t agree with it. I plan on using this site for as long as it&#039;s safe. And then probably still afterwards.<br /><br />But let&#039;s put it this way: you&#039;ll tolerate a 50% chance of getting caught, but not a 60% chance. If there is a 1% chance of getting caught every time you use the silk road, you might determine before hand that you&#039;re willing to make 50 purchases, but not 60.<br /><br />To use a different example, the marginal risk of smoking a cigarette is very low. One extra cigarette has a very low chance of killing you. But if you used that excuse forever, &quot;one more isn&#039;t going to make a difference&quot; then eventually there is a very high probability of dying from smoking. One might decide that they&#039;ve taken on enough risk smoking and quit - they may even know how much smoking it will take them to quit before hand.

				Unless you use SR for other reasons, it&#039;s a market for drugs.<br /><br />Drugs are either consumed or sold, which means you&#039;ll need more of them.

Although my intention is for a one use time (read some posts of mine) I feel this is an amazing community where I can have great input. I like it here because I feel I wont be judge no matter what its going on in my life. I have great respect for users who use smartly:) And I have GREAT sympathy for those who have lose themselves in use..... like myself once.

				not to mention this is the most drug informative forum on the web. <br />i&#039;ve researched more shit on this forum then bluelight and erowid combined. <br /><br />i love this forum<br />where else do you see drug users begging for change online<br />where else do you see people offering free samples for drugs<br />where else do you see usernames like &quot;here4meth&quot;<br /><br />this place has replaced all my &quot;friends&quot; sadly to say. lol <br />if this place went down, i would cry harder than any man has ever cried...<br />this place makes me feel like a celebrity that has access to any drug any time of the day. <br /><br />Thank you SR admin and everyone that makes this site possible. thank you a lot.

Unquestionably. Cheaper? Not even remotely. I understand the premium is for the reliability and quality, and not having to deal with what&#039;s often lowest common denominator in human gene pool so I&#039;m not complaining.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br /><br />
