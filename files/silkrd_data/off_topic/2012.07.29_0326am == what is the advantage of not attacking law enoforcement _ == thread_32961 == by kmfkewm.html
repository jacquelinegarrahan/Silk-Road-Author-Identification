				The only reason to not anonymously attack LE is that there is a death penalty in some countries, but I don&#039;t understand vendors in countries without death penalties and with strict drug laws, why don&#039;t you mail bombs to law enorcement agents? You should be anonymous in either case right? I mean, if they can get you mailing one thing why not another. So I guess what I don&#039;t understand is, why do you risk going to jail forever mailing drugs, when you could risk going to jail forever mailing bombs to people who want you to go to jail forever for mailing drugs?

				If you remember back when, I had a thread like this, albeit I was asking whether or not a defensive posture always makes logical sense for tactical reasons.<br /><br />My main problems with killing LE agents is:<br /><br />1. The intelligence agencies will be forced to hunt us down as domestic terrorists. So... that could be a practical problem, ha. Seeing as right now we&#039;re leagues out of their jurisdiction, seems like a good idea to keep it that way. <br /><br />2. Some LE agents pretty much agree with us completely and soften the face of the hardliners in the DEA. <br /><br />3. Reputational damage to the Silk Road, which is after all, a market, a business and not an army, its appointment as a service depends entirely on being in the people&#039;s favor.<br /><br />However there is a 4th point I think you&#039;re missing here kmf. Sending mail bombs is not a terribly efficient method of obtaining results however thrilling it may seem. I mean that you could kill an awful lot of people if<br />you planned it correctly, but if it doesn&#039;t achieve a higher goal, then what is the entire point? It strikes me <br />as both unimaginative and unambitious. I have been studying the Baader-Meinhof group and I hate to fail.<br /><br />I think the Silk Road correctly views soft power as the best available weapon to influence the course of <br />events in its favor. <br /><br />However, major caveat. If we all literally were being collected into boxcars and put into concentration camps<br />to be tortured and murdered, then obviously the gloves come off and it is a fight to the death until one of us<br />is the victor. You can tell me this is already happening in some areas, and I would agree it is occurring in particular places, but that is a proxy war mostly waged in the South America countries and Mexico. <br /><br />I mean, I sympathize with the plight of those involved and otherwise caught up in those underground conflicts, but the Drug War is still a metaphorical concept inside the West. That is kinda the tacitly agreed deal. Make no mistake, I think it could spread to North America and Europe much more easily than most people imagine, but right now it is not. If LEO ultimately comes to force our hand (this happened before in Maoist China as students of history will know), then the economics of System D will lend support to political action which will obviously begin the equivalent of an Operation Condor with a series of targeted assassinations and finance a coup or two.<br /><br />However, such thoughts are ludicrous right now. For one thing, we are closer than ever before to winning the Drug War. More Americans agree with SR&#039;s fundamental positions than ever before. There will come a tipping point and the DEA will quietly have its teeth filed down and its warmongers retired. Why get in the way of some an excellent result? A war today would tip the balance in the favor of the DEA, not ourselves.

				Needle exchanges are an example of ignorance and the need for policy reform and hopefully not spite. People addicted to drugs are going to get them and use them, may it be with a clean needle or a used needle with pond water. Blowing fuckers up is certainly not going to win anyone over. Mail sent to federal buildings and agencies is scrutinized with spectrometers and shit, and to think you&#039;d attempt to blow up a building is disturbing. <br /><br />Have you ever been to a federal building? it&#039;s not just the DEA or law enforcement. Innocent government workers and for fucks sake, local military recruiters and MEPS stations are in federal buildings. Are you going to start killing American soldiers as well? It&#039;s the policy, not the people that enforce the laws that need to be dealt with.

If LEO ultimately comes to force our hand (this happened before in Maoist China as students of history will know), then the economics of System D will lend support to political action which will obviously begin the equivalent of an Operation Condor with a series of targeted assassinations and finance a coup or two.<br /><br />However, such thoughts are ludicrous right now. For one thing, we are closer than ever before to winning the Drug War. More Americans agree with SR&#039;s fundamental positions than ever before. There will come a tipping point and the DEA will quietly have its teeth filed down and its warmongers retired. Why get in the way of some an excellent result? A war today would tip the balance in the favor of the DEA, not ourselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Dammit Pine your posts are always on point I feel like I just steal your opinions&nbsp; :D <br /><br />1. I agree, so long as we don&#039;t mess with LE they won&#039;t really mess with us unless we start giving them a reason too and attacking them with bombs, threats, etc is certainly a reason to come after us.<br /><br />2.I feel like a lot LEOs agree with what SR is doing because essentially we&#039;re cutting down on local drug crime, before I found SR I used to have to go through scary people just to finally get a connect. On top of that we&#039;re really ruining the cartel&#039;s business which I think LE can agree is good.<br /><br />3.Exactly, if we show nothing but compassion and show that we are the drug revolution then people will see that there is nothing wrong with responsible adults wanting to experience drugs without risking having to go out in public and getting hurt. <br /><br />4. Well, you said it perfectly.

				Certain fuckers who operate without logic and run on bile, propaganda and misinformation are undeserving of life if they do not strive toward a peaceful and tolerant society. But might I ask who are we to choose who lives or dies? Is there some criteria? Do I necessarily wish death upon those who would wish that I be imprisoned and raped in the ass for ordering MDMA or marijuana in the mail? Not particularly. From the viewpoint of society, from the perspective of the majority we are criminals and deserve our punishment. The only way to reform policy or move toward acceptance is peaceful co-existence.

Without that you&#039;re sunk, you don&#039;t have the market behind you. Unconventional warfare only works when there&#039;s an enormous groundswell of support. The force with the largest amount of control over GDP inside the territory being fought over wins every single time, that&#039;s what history says.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i accept that other people may have an stockholm syndrome-esque relationship with the state and will disapprove of violence against it, usually with some useless platitude like &quot;we are the government!&quot; that doesn&#039;t mean that i won&#039;t resist violence against me with violence of my own<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But Shannon, I am not arguing against violence as a tool. Although sympathetic to the anarcho-capitalists like anaracho54, I think there is a limit to the NAP concept. There are exceptions that prove (as in test) the rule.<br /><br />Violence is legitimate when you are being physically and directly attacked. Hardly anybody would disagree to that, since natural selection, well...<br /><br />Violence is also legitimate when you have a mandate from the market/people (don&#039;t see a distinction between those two things). Violence is also completely legitimate for the state to use in certain situations. For example, picture this in your mind&#039;s eye:<br /><br />You are alone in your house, possibly on SRF. You hear somebody knocking on the door quietly and run down to investigate the source of the noise. There is a little girl, only 7 or 8, carrying a small baby. Her clothes are stained with blood and she trembles constantly as she tells you that her Father has attacked her Mother in a intoxicated rage and caved in her head with a tinned can in the kitchen. She waited until he began to sleep in a drunken stupor and then took her smaller sibling and ran as fast as she could from her house to yours where she is now appealing for you to help.<br /><br />Your options:<br /><br />1. Take on this degenerate yourself.<br />2. Call the police.<br />3. Do nothing.<br />4. Call your friends and take this guy on.<br /><br />Out of these, No.2 is clearly the best option in the vast majority of situations. The state will use violence here, but so it should. You could argue that because he employed coercion on another human being that he loses the right to expect his civil liberties to be respected. But then there is the thorny subject of the alcohol, which he consumes as a free choice. Should that free choice be allowed to this man, who repeatedly becomes violent when drunk?<br /><br />Obviously I am not for Drug Prohibition, which is a naive &#039;first glance&#039; way to tackle this situation IMHO. It is just that unless you are a -&gt; responsible &lt;- drug taker, you are impinging on other people&#039;s liberties, at which point you ought to lose your own. Most people choose the police to achieve that end for practical reasons.<br /><br />Now, if we are talking about the responsible use of drugs, and the police are putting the boot in, then yes, this is an illegitimate use of coercion. The central problem is that a lot of people think you are all irresponsible and impinge on other people&#039;s liberties. They may be wrong. Indeed, this is very frequently the case. But the police still have a mandate to enforce the will of the majority because of the first situation, and so we have this dreadful trap we are in.<br /><br />We are gradually wining the war on drugs because it is an injustice to penalize functional, responsible users of drugs for the behavior of a much smaller group of people. If you start to commit violence yourself in a preemptive strike against the state, then you jeopardize that trend.&nbsp; <br /><br />Indirect violence that you referred to before, is not the same thing as direct violence. Yes, prohibition makes drugs impure and costs lives. Undoubtedly. The trouble is that this logic leads you to other conclusions that are insupportable positions. Like, why not murder all the non-functional drug users who are clearly disenfranchising the majority of us? What about killing all those salespeople who sold property at inflated values during the housing bubble? Did they not hurt people? Seems like you&#039;re assuming a great deal of prescience and authority without telling me where you got all this power from.<br /><br />I think the market is partly a mechanism that exercises a optimal harm reduction algorithm, and I don&#039;t mean harm reduction as in drugs, but in the sense that it dispenses the least pain for the greatest gain. e.g. people lose jobs in one industry, but growth overall is a net positive. There will always be winners and losers. The issue is whether it&#039;s a positive sum game or not. If the police start engaging in a negative sum game by generalizing and begin executing us all, then do you think we&#039;ll sit back and take it? Hardly. Don&#039;t worry on that score, pine is quite capable of fighting back.<br /><br />Right now, you are committing the same moral sin that permits the hardliners in the DEA to exercise their unjust war of mass generalization. It is the same sin that allowed Osama Bin Laden and his ilk to bomb civilians, the majority of whom don&#039;t even support the inane activities of the US Government that caused him to plot the 9/11 attacks. And the same that allowed G.Bush to &#039;free&#039; Iraq and Afghanistan. It is legitimate for an Iraqi affected by the war to murder the Bush or Blair. It is not legitimate for him to bomb a typical American household because they live in the same geographical region.<br /><br />This is not complex. This is Prisoner&#039;s Dilemma, and I pay Tit for Tat. I cooperate first, but if the other entity continually defects, then I will play the same card straight back to him. This is the most optimal algorithm for determining net positive economic, social and political progress, however simple minded it sounds.<br /><br />--<br /><br />TLDR; The logic of preemptive strike and the greater good is not a scientific determination, but arrogant thinking. If participating in indirect harm, or making mistakes is punishable by death, then society will eat itself up.

Anything.<br />Do people get bored of things they&#039;ve seen before? Yes.<br />Is there a need for new, fresh, or at least re-hashed content? Always.<br />Do some people collect CP? Yes.<br /><br />So, what can we extrapolate from these facts? Oh right, I already extrapolated them.<br /><br />See how it works? The collection, consumption, or desire for CP creates a market-environment for the for-profit production of CP.<br />Thus, you are a miniscule, but non-negligible, cause for the rape of children and the production of CP.

				I think I kinda agree with that its not That bad to do something like this in such a &quot;war on drugs&quot; with the means/force that the other side (the law) is unrightfully (in our eyes) using, and would be the strongest and most unavoidable signal there is to send them. <br />Too many who were unwilling to use violence thru history were the ones who were forgotten, gone- they lost, to the ones who did dear to go to the extremes.<br />But for it to work in a beneficial way for us would require much sacrifice from many dedicated ones (&quot;martyrs&quot;) who would not stop, and be willing to face prison/death before the goal is reached once they step up and put harder measures to counteract these attacks. I don&#039;t think that many are willing right now.. would prolly require something like a religious conviction to sacrifice ones life (and continued by many, in huge numbers to make a difference). I can&#039;t think of ways to convince sufficient amounts..&nbsp; and no way to tell how long this drug-war will continue like this for it to be worth doing it like this<br /><br />Theres no doubt of the mass-death and misery all over the world caused by the current bad situation. Something like this could save many more lives in the long run if it worked. But Im not sure it would be the best..I guess you can use similar arguments for many similar situations, most of the time it may just end in chaos or worse if goal is not reached.&nbsp; But sure, may work, I think.. especcialy on a local level even if done alone (for however long ud manage to keep doing it...), killing off a bunch of agents and thinning out their lines would if nothing else get even crappier investigators in the job taking the deceased&#039;s place, getting much more attention around the cause aswell and surely new sympathizers tho many new enemies (any pr is good pr- many here who knew about al&#039;qaida before 9&#039;11?)<br />Im not sure tho, therefore wont be the one to be sending away the first bombs anyway=P&nbsp; But I think theres something in it.. if this turns out to get even worse, eventually, I think something like this will and should happen- for everyones best in the long run.<br /><br />If I lived in a country with deathpenalty for what I was doing, and I thought there was a good chanse I would get away with such- I might very well have wanted to pick off some agents any way possible for whatever reason if it would increase my chanses to stay safe/alive and deter adversaries<br /><br />here a quote from ure President JFK: &quot;those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable&quot;<br />hopefully our peaceful revolution is not futile and this will never be needed..=) not sure when we can say whether it has failed or not....

Maybe that path will be the best for all parties.<br /><br /><br />And yes I think so, Al&#039;quaida now has huge global followings (perhaps not publicly showing off that they agree with them, using the same name etc. but thru new groups with similar views- ) with large amounts identifying with many of their ideals and hostility to the west and it worked to unite and organize many many millions aruound the world with these same views who now all agrees on the same (conservative/extreme/true Islam) that has been very apparent past 10 or so years now.&nbsp; Even in my tiny country in northern europe theres many new hostile groups of young muslims now identifying themselves with these people who wants us dead and their islamic state established. Without these terror attacks they would not have these things to unite them and &quot;set the agenda&quot;, atleast they would be hostile different ways and less organized within their groups<br /><br />Sure it needs a cause that people will be able to sympathize with in sufficient numbers (altho if reaching enough with attention- whatever reasons u have, loads will agree with you however stupid), but unfortunately it seems that currently military-style shock-attacks and murder of many and the likes seems to be the clearest path to attention. Thank our media for that (?)<br /><br />&quot;Our war is a social and political war, not a physical one.&quot; -- it is very much a physical one I think, atleast whats being done by the other side, altho we may be lucky to avoid the worst of it. If waiting till it would get that bad (like Mexico?) when we would be affected like that (if they step up the war on drugs or something) it could be too late, when the other side are too powerful or public opinion too hard to sway. People are killed, end up in misery and die all the time (probably very many every day) cos of this drugwar. If it could be ended tomorrow with the murder of example 100 people I would accept that.<br /><br />Sure terror works and the like works, and may often be the only (and &quot;best&quot;) thing that can lead to change under oppression<br /><br />But again I dont think I support such attacks.. if I was certain it was the right thing I might have contributed somehow already, but Im still far from convinced this would be the right for this cause nor dedicated enough to sacrifice myself . . for reasons u and others already stated^^<br /><br />But hypothetically, in the extreme case that things clearly would turn for the worse without chanse for our side winning this war, or something.. I dont think we should exclude this, and I may understand desperate unfortunate victims of this war to sacrifice themselves trying to make a difference along the way before we get there<br /><br />again, Im not really supporting that stuff I think.. not now atleast. I wont be killing anyone, Im a very peaceful guy=)

				&nbsp; &nbsp; This &quot;Why dont we just, like, kill all the pigs maan?&quot; bullshit seems to crop up round here<br />depressingly often.I hope you would be assasins realise, that far from the anarchist freedom fighters<br />&nbsp;you think you sound like, you actually come accross like 13 year old geeks who&#039;ve been listening to too&nbsp;<br />much Ice-T.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike most of you wannabe cop-killers, I have been arrested on numerous occasions (for heroin related<br />&nbsp;petty crime) and I have mostly found the police to be decent and sympathetic. Some were dickheads,<br />but not to the extent they deserved death.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The police do a difficult and dangerous job, which most of them would characterize as &quot;preventing people<br />&nbsp;from hurting each other&quot; All societies need policing, unless we are to revert to the extremely violent past.<br />Unortunately, our society has dug itself into a hole by including drug use and trade in the category of &quot;hurting<br />each other&quot;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This isn&#039;t entirely false; drugs do cause harm. If as a drug user you havent witnessed this harm then, well<br />wait and see. This is why I have little sympathy for drug vendors who portray themselves as oppressed minoritys, being<br />persecuted for trying to make people happy. You have chosen to make money in an extremely profitable field, which<br />is so lucrative because of its illegality. It is unregulated, and you are reckless of the harm your merchandise may<br />cause. You are not the villain, but neither are you the hero of this scenario. I am not saying drug dealing is bad, but it isn&#039;t<br />a revolutionary protest.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; However, it has become obvious to all sensible people, that our drug policy is doing more harm than good.

				Yep, I mean the reason the Nazis get brought up so often in these arguments is because that was one of the few times in history where an armed struggle was pretty much unavoidable.<br />It&#039;s important to remember that even the Nazis right up to Hitler himself...well.... They didn&#039;t KNOW they were evil! They genuinely thought they were doing the right thing! Now that&#039;s not gonna be much consolation if you witness your family getting murdered but it&#039;s worth thinking about. There&#039;s a funny comedy sketch by Mitchell and Webb(not usually funny outside of Peep Show) with an SS officer coming to a dreadful realisation: &quot; Hans... Look.... We&#039;ve got SKULLS on our hats....Hans.... Do you think? .....are we the Baddies?!&quot;<br /><br />Still, I don&#039;t think we are in a situation where some kind of armed uprising will get us where we want to be. If we killed all the police and all the politicians then the army would declare martial law and good luck persuading them to legalise drugs. I don&#039;t think &quot;DENY! Lawyer&quot; is going to do much good when you are being summilarily executed by firing squad.

				So the Op has rape and pedophilia fantasies, believes child pornography should be legal, and wants to go on a bombing spree. Seems legit.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />This dumb shit is going to end up in an article. I&#039;d rather not be labeled as a boy-fucking terrorist because some deranged individual feels the need to spew his weird manifesto on to Silk Road.&nbsp; If this site wasn&#039;t moderated like shit I believe this shit would be deleted and there would be some bannings. <br /><br />If you feel like rambling about killing fuckers you should have posted this in the Armory forum. Now some faggot at Gawker gets to call us domestic terrorists and pedophiles.

				Lol this thread is totally ending up in some media article.<br /><br />First of all mailing bombs is the stupidest way to be a terrorist. They almost always go off during handling, or killing some poor receptionist. If you want to murder random people or possibly yourself mailing bombs is a great way to do it.<br /><br /># when you mail bombs, you will get caught, every other mail bomber was caught, and all thought they were &#039;uncatchable&#039;<br /><br /># attempting to kill cops is a federal terrorism charge and the death penalty in a lot of countries. <br /><br /># attacking the police is misguided, they are only enforcing the dumb assed laws our politicans and largely the idiot masses have voted in. <br /><br />Instead there is considerable advantage on spying on law enforcement to avoid prosecution, or learning about their processes to beat them at their own game.&nbsp; Setting up your business so it flusters the police trying to take you down, and the courts have to set you free. It&#039;s not about becoming a terrorist and randomly killing postal employees and receptionists. It&#039;s about using 21st century technology and loopholes to become untouchable, showing their unjust prohibition laws are meaningless to try to enforce, therefore should be dropped.<br /><br />Bruce Schneier likes to blog about how criminals never use probability or consider the propagation of errors effect in their crimes. If they did, they&#039;d discover how utterly stupid and futile an endeavor it was. Mailing bombs = propagation of errors and max probability it&#039;s going to kill some innocent person. There is no empirical data that terrorism has ever worked in any country to acheive law changes either. Why don&#039;t you organize some anti prohibition riots instead

				Non-violent resistance is the only way we will achieve our goals.<br /><br />It can be hard, I know, but violence will only make us look like thugs, which we aren&#039;t.<br /><br />Being non-violent isn&#039;t an easy path to take, but it&#039;s the only one that will allow us to succeed.&nbsp; It can be easy to lash out in anger, but it is infinitely more rewarding to take the road of peaceful resistance.

				I know this has already been locked but I have to say I am fucking astounded by the naivety of this thread. You are posting shit that makes SR look like it&#039;s advocating violence against LE which will only gives them more of an excuse for them to saddle up and kick in DPR + Co&#039;s doors much faster and with the aggression that people are bitching so much about. <br /><br />You want to have SR around for a long time?
