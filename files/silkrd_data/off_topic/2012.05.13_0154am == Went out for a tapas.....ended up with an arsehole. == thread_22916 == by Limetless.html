				Bit of a &quot;Fuck My Life&quot; thread here. <br /><br />Went out with the fam-a-lam today, overdue a visit and it&#039;s always good to reconnect. You know how it is. <br /><br />Anyway after a fine day out doing all sorts of fun things we went out for dinner at this plush tapas restaurant ran by one of my friends (nah, not one of the shitty chain ones, fuck that shit), my treat. It get&#039;s well busy there on a Sat night so I booked a week in advance and made sure that we had the nice end of the place upstairs because it&#039;s less crowded also it&#039;s near the bar and the waitresses and bar birds are FIT. Eye-candy + tapas = sorted. <br /><br />Anyway we arrived and we sat down and all was well but then this party came in that were obviously on a work do. At first they seemed ok and in fact, all apart from one of them were. This one fucking guy who reckoned he was was jack-the-lad basically seemed to think that his personal space included the whole room. Typical obnoxious prick approaching an early midlife crisis and the people who were with him clearly were embarrassed to be with him. <br /><br />Before I continue, just want to clarify a few bits. <br /><br />1. I realize I&#039;m a bit blunt/rough round the edges, but I only am when it&#039;s socially acceptable. I reign that shit in when I&#039;m with fam/kids. <br /><br />2. I can&#039;t deal with people who make pervy and sleazy comments in front of women. Massive pet hate. <br /><br />3. I can&#039;t stand it when people do that stuff around kids. <br /><br />4. This is my friends place he&#039;s in, by acting like he is he&#039;s making people feel bad. It&#039;s disrespectful.<br /><br />Anyway I started hearing him saying some really coarse shit. Stuff that really made my skin crawl and he was swearing a lot. Normally, I wouldn&#039;t give a shit at all but only when it&#039;s appropriate. If I&#039;m with my friends then I will say what I like, but you can&#039;t when you are in public and obviously you have to respect other peoples personal space. Anyway he started coming out with things like &quot;Yeah Jenny (person who he was with, name changed) I know for a fact I&#039;m making you moist babe&quot; and swearing like there is no tomorrow. The woman he was with was clearly creeped out by this and my family. My Ma shouldn&#039;t be subjected to that and neither should the kids in my family (they are very young) so I went over and asked him to keep quiet, he asked what my problem was so I told him what the issue was and that he needed to shut the fuck up yesterday. He did. I then went back to sit down, carried on and was fine but as I got up to go to the lav this prick called out &quot;Yeah walk by you fucking wanker&quot;. I left it because you can&#039;t cause scenes in front of the family, isn&#039;t cool. After a while everyone from his table left and it was just 3 of them that stayed behind including Mr Cunt so I saw this as a perfect opportunity. When I got the bill I deliberately left my ciggies and lighter on the table so I could go back in while the fam got in the taxi. So I went back in and walked over and tipped his food and his drink in his lap and told him if he had a problem with my earlier request then he needed to walk the fuck by me and go outside for a good hiding. He did not move. <br /><br />Went out for a tapas....ended up with an arsehole. <br /><br />Rant over. Needed a vent.

				Nothing quite like watching a cunt get put in their place. ;D Me and my mates run into this bullshit on a near weekly basis, but it&#039;s like you said, the majority of these assholes are all talk when it comes to a confrontation. Just so long as no one&#039;s packing heat, I don&#039;t hesitate to show my knife to shut the fuckers up. Best part of being under the influence of 25i is when a chance for violence springs up, it makes me feel like I can take anyone on. I&#039;ve always been a masochist though luckily, and noticed my fair share of scars helps intimidate the average wanker off before it ever escalates to anything further unfortunately.<br /><br />I&#039;m really a teddy-bear on the inside though. ;)

				+1<br /><br />I&#039;m with Pine though, I expected a striping in this story :) But well done on keeping cool...I had a similar situation a few weeks ago and I wanted to cut the fucker (I&#039;m a chick, all of about 5ft nothing, and not tough at all so it was slightly laughable but I gave him so harsh words - he was calling my friends &quot;fucking cunts&quot; in front of my Mum and some kids, what is wrong with people?!?!)<br /><br />Also, Tapas - food envy!!

				WTF is up with people?<br />Sorta related story... a friend of mine went out for tapas the other night, and he and his lady came out to find five high school kids kicking in their car doors and smashing windows.&nbsp; My buddy told the kids to fuck off and got a hammer to the side of his head, followed by a curb-stomping for it.&nbsp; Docs say he&#039;s going to have brain damage &#039;n shit.<br />I know how to find almost anything.&nbsp; Drugs, people, etc.&nbsp; I&#039;ve already tracked down most of the kids, and am prolly only one more conversation away from finding the guy with the hammer.<br />I&#039;m thinking a Dexter approach for grabbing him, and a Limetless striping to teach him a lesson is in order.<br />Assholes are everywhere!!!<br /><br />Tips Limetless?&nbsp; Vertical stripes with the stanley, then you pull every other strip of skin off, so he looks like the black flag symbol?

				If you want them gone you don&#039;t need to be that public. All you have to do is find out where they live and break in to their homes and duct-tape matches to their door frame and the phosphorous strike stip to the other side. Ripe out the oven so there is a gas leak and put the over back in place to conceal. <br /><br />They will get a shitty shock when they walk through their door but this will only last about 1-2 seconds before they hit the bricks.

				Problem with gas though is if its left to long they might be able to smell it before they get in, but then again they will still open the door to check things out. Either way they will probably die from the blast way could brake in while they are asleep and let them die from gas poisoning, not as pleasing visually but would get it done.
