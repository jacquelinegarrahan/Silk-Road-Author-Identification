				Let&#039;s get a &quot;You know you&#039;re on drugs when..&quot; thread going here, I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve ever had one.<br /><br />Anyway one time I was hanging out with a buddy back in the day when I was still experimenting on my edibles. They hit me hard, I ate two brownies thinking you know &quot;Oh I&#039;m veteran, this won&#039;t get that high.&quot; My buddy&#039;s wife isn&#039;t fond of drugs and I couldn&#039;t hide the fact that I was blown cause it came out of nowhere and my buddy knew right away so he said something like &#039;hey come check out the new amp I got in my car.&quot; (I don&#039;t even like cars, let alone stereos but I knew where he was going with it) So we leave and go into his car and the first thing I do is put my seatbelt on and look forward ready to leave but then I slowly turn my head over to look at him and we both start laughing our asses off.<br /><br /><br />Obviously you guys have better stories than me so let&#039;s hear them.

				Funny shit bro! Props to your bro for getting you out of there. <br /><br />A while back I was with my buddy in st. louis for a bachelor party. I had 4 x beans I got off SR, didn&#039;t know the strength of them. They were the red Defqon&#039;s (!!). There were four of us, but two of the dudes weren&#039;t down, just were going to stick to beer. Anyways me and my boy popped both and didn&#039;t feel anything. We had both rolled around ten times, but always just molly powder. Anyways about 35 minutes in we were at a bar, and it fucking hit me like a ton of bricks. I took a few minutes to collect myself and glanced over at my friend and he gave me this wide eyed OH SHIT look. Haha. I was like...hey man let me show you something outside. We both went outside, sat down, rode out the come up, and after that went to the strip club ROLLING BALLS. Holy shit, best night ever. The other dudes were like wtf. hahaha&nbsp; so funny. Then i dropped like $250 on strippers. holy shit what i&#039;d give to relive that night

				Ahahaha so funny.<br /><br />Back in the day my boys and I would toke up and go out to malls and just act like total fuckin&#039; fools. The malls here are HUGE so it&#039;s like being in a fucking amusement park when you&#039;re riding kites. Anyway, one time it was one of our buddies first times smoking, and you know how it is the first few times. We go into an ice cream shop at the mall and we all order our shit and start chowing down. Well the newbie smoker was just standing there staring at the fuckin menu... eventually he goes over and explains to the teen working behind the counter why a certain ice cream was named the way it was because of how they wittily combined the names of the ingredients in the ice cream together. He went into such detail with this that the kid finally got fed up and yelled at him if he&#039;s gonna order that or not. My friend was so offended that he couldn&#039;t even talk and just walked over and sat down and looked at the table like he just got dumped.<br /><br />We were laughing so hard the entire time until he turned and came to sit down. Then for some reason we all shut up super quick and stared at him while eating our ice cream.

Normally i go 200 mg with a 50 mg booster if needed (not always). But these defqons were rated at 190 mg+ according to pill reports. Needless to say i was sweating like a MOFO all night and the comeup was brutal. But once I settled in It was ok. Had full eye wiggles and everything.&nbsp; They are deceiving because they are so small. Up until then I had never tried any pills. I actually ordered 20 of the triforces from the same dude, shit never showed :(&nbsp; Shipments from NL are widely unrealiable as of late.&nbsp;

I think we all remember our first times or should at least. I still remember my first time smoking weed which now seems a million years ago because my friend&#039;s buddy got him into weed (I was against it in my teen years, ironic I know) but it was my really good friend so of course I didn&#039;t judge him for smoking it, then one day we go hang out at the park at night and his buddy came through and pulled out his pipe and my friend freaked out thinking I was going to freak out but I didn&#039;t I figured I might as well try it if my best friend does. I&#039;ll never forget how it looked too, it was straight up grass, that famous Mexican dirt weed. He didn&#039;t even have to shred it cause it was so dry it was already crumpled. Anyway, so he loads up the bowl for me and of course I look like a retard smoking I mean who doesn&#039;t look retarded when they smoke out of a pipe for the first time. So it was a 3 man job, I held the pipe, my friend held the carb, and my friend&#039;s buddy lit it up. I took a big hit and immediately started coughing cause it was so harsh, oh god it hurt so bad all that harsh smoke in my lungs. I couldn&#039;t take another hit and didn&#039;t feel anything after the pain went away so I was pretty let down cause I wanted to get high especially after all that pain so we get up and decide to go to the restaurant next to the park and as we&#039;re walking I get the biggest grin on my face and my friend is like &quot;do you feel it now?&quot; Then I realized for the first time in my life that I was walking, they start dying when I tell them something like &quot;wait how am I walking right now? like what&#039;s telling my brain to move my legs, am I telling it? how am I doing it?&quot;

Classic first timer hazing! I did that with my buddy and some acid. His first time, about three hours in, we went for a walk at like midnight and went to a whataburger. He was trying to order a meal and i could see he was tripping balls. He got his drink cup and almost left without his food lol. The fear was definitely getting to him LOL

				You know when you are on drugs when you are snorting in Aiya Napa snorting Blow and Meph and off a birds tits in a Jacuzzi but then do a massive line of ket and then go into a K hole under water and have to be fished out. <br /><br />Ruined the moment and did not get laid. Fucking epic fail. :(
