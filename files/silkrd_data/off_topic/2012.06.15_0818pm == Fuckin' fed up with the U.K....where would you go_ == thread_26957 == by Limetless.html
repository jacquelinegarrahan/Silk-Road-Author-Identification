				This is especially for Brits, but fuck it anyone give an answer as well. <br /><br />Basically I am fed up with this morbid country with it&#039;s shit weather, ever increasingly invasive laws, crap food, crap society, stupid kids that are getting dumber every leaving school year, crap finances and just general shitness. So given all that I am mulling over the idea of getting the fuck out of dodge and wandering off to somewhere with a bit more sun, where summer actually starts in May/June, where people don&#039;t wander around proud of wearing shell-suits and where Ed Milliband wouldn&#039;t be considered a good candidate as leader of the opposition party. <br /><br />So out of the places I&#039;ve listed above vote, give your reasons why or if you&#039;d go somewhere else. Please share and tell me why. <br /><br />And just to make it clear, just because I have listed these places DOESN&#039;T mean I&#039;ll be going there or going at all. It&#039;s just an idea that popped into my mind today and I was wondering where people would go themselves. However if LE are reading this I&#039;ll be moving to an igloo at the South Pole so yeah, send SOCA or Interpol or whatever police force covers Antarctica because THAT IS DEFINITELY WHERE I WILL BE. I PROMISE. HANDS DOWN SWEAR ON MY LIFE I WILL DEFINITELY, 100% BE AT THE SOUTH POLE. <br />

Baring mind what I do for a living I&#039;m alright for tangling with the FBI and all that other shit you have. Also, imagine if I got nicked there. I can&#039;t speak bloody American and I&#039;d get mugged off because of my accent. I speak more Italian and Spanish than bloody American.

				I will consider a nation which might look after me with free health care.<br /><br />The UK compared to other nations is great. It might be that some of you are young enough to leave but usually you could feel pissed off anywhere. Even more so if you broke a leg and someone asked if you could pay for treatment.<br /><br />Travelling is good.<br /><br />but the UK has too many good things for me to leave.<br /><br />That said I have thought about it. Spain is good. I know someone who moved to Mexico also.<br /><br />Australia, New Zealand, they are too hot!!<br /><br />The USA - got relatives there who love it and made a good living there. I know others who went to the USA and hated it. The people are great but the USA has little for the poor! <br /><br />the UK we have safety nets. If I lost my job I would be in need of the safety net!<br /><br />Millions would come to the UK in a flash.<br /><br />And if Africa had free health care and free housing I&#039;d live there for 6 months, get a crop in at least&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Laters

				I have thought about Brazil but I don&#039;t speak any Portuguese. <br /><br />Also I don&#039;t care about paying for healthcare and things like that. I have enough money to deal with things like that and I prefer private health anyway because you get a better quality of care. Sorry to any socialists out there, but it&#039;s true and I don&#039;t like the idea of getting things free when I can pay for them myself. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t go to Australia or New Zealand because it would be too hard to set up shop there and I really can&#039;t be fucked with their customs or getting beaten up by a kangaroo. I can see me going to a bar in the outback and thinking one is giving me a funny look. And come on, Kangaroos can box, no human stands a fucking chance against an animal that can box. It&#039;d kick my ass all over that big red rock they have.

				I understand what you are saying about the shit weather Limitless.<br /><br />I am in Ireland and we haven&#039;t had a decent Summer in about 10 years. <br /><br />If I was going abroad, i&#039;d move to somewhere like Peru. I am very interested in Shamanic society and their way of life, so i&#039;d get real Shamanic experiences down there from the originals :-)<br /><br />The idea is in my head now! :-) I&#039;ll have to act on it one of these days!

				I&#039;d go to Spain, without a doubt. Anyone watched the film &#039;The Business&#039;? I&#039;ve wanted to go Spain ever since, nice looking women, good drugs, nice weather from time-time. That&#039;s what I call perfection.

				For me definitely Ibiza, I go there several times a year and it&#039;s like heaven. The police are practically none existent, you can go there and back holding your suitcase without it being checked once. Several times they haven&#039;t even checked my passport going on to the island. You can drive whatever you want however you want, noone seems to care. All the roads are practically brand new and you can drive from the airport to the center of the main city, Ibiza Town in about 5 mins.<br /><br />The weather is amazing, even during winter, I was there in February this year and got severely sunburned like a lobster as I forgot to pack suncream. <br /><br />The villa prices are really good, and you can get some spectacular villas, such as on top of hills with an infinity pool which flows over into the sea and steps down to your own beach with crystal clear blue water for about £400,000, Engel &amp; Volkers the famous international German estate agency are the place to look. They will deal with you in cash and no questions asked.<br /><br />The food in most restaurants, even local bars is Michelin Star compared to what they serve up here in the UK (and I eat in a lot of Michelin restaurants in the UK). The food is also ridiculously cheap and any drugs are incredibly easy to come by. Pacha now has a new restaurant which is simply mind blowing, the service and food is amazing and it&#039;s always full of British bankers looking to party away from Canary Wharf for the weekend. <br /><br />The clubs are without a doubt the best in the world, you&#039;ve got Pacha, Space, Privilege, Amnesia, Cafe Del Mar, Bora Bora etc etc, which are all mind blowing, and cater to all social types, from Cafe Del Mar which is nice and chilled out and an amazing place to have a Mojito and watch the sunset onto the sea to Pacha which is just something else.<br /><br />You can literally buy drugs anytime of year outside most bars from the Russian looking guys on the pavement or black guys who walk up and down the beaches all day selling &quot;Sunglasses&quot;, and they&#039;re amazing quality, most straight from the Netherlands.<br /><br />I mean just look at this shit:<br /><br />http://www.engelvoelkers.com/es/ibiza/cala-carb%C3%B3/modern-designer-townhouse-with-views-to-es-vedr%C3%A1-w-00ivza-881254.210989_exp/?startIndex=49&amp;sortField=sortPrice&amp;businessArea=&amp;sortOrder=ASC&amp;q=&amp;facets=bsnssr%3Aresidential%3Bcntry%3Aspain%3Bdstrct%3Aibiza%3Brgn%3Aibiza%3Btyp%3Abuy%3B&amp;pageSize=50&amp;language=en&amp;elang=en<br /><br />http://www.engelvoelkers.com/es/ibiza/ntra-sra-de-jes%C3%BAs/stunning-villa-with-top-view-w-00s7px-1316373.366103_exp/?startIndex=4&amp;businessArea=&amp;q=&amp;facets=bsnssr%3Aresidential%3Bcntry%3Aspain%3Bdstrct%3Aibiza%3Brgn%3Aibiza%3Btyp%3Abuy%3B&amp;pageSize=10&amp;language=en&amp;elang=en<br /><br />If you&#039;re older you can explore the old town on top of the hill in Ibiza&#039;s main city, which is spectacular, and like a town built into a castle ontop of a really tall hill, it&#039;s fully of jewellery shops where they will make stuff for you by hand infront of you, and some amazing restaurants with views over the harbor:<br /><br />http://www.travelandlivingchannel.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Ibiza-Holiday-Deals.jpg<br /><br />http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=677&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=9G9fGnctm8tGkM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.travelguideibiza.com/visit-the-old-town-of-ibiza/&amp;docid=GVuH1029jJFeoM&amp;imgurl=http://www.travelguideibiza.com/wp-content/uploads/Ibiza-old-town.jpg&amp;w=1280&amp;h=960&amp;ei=H7DbT9-oIIrt8AP0yLGeCw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=176&amp;sig=104295618488582869994&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=139&amp;tbnw=185&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=21&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:105&amp;tx=105&amp;ty=50<br /><br />You can get return flights for £20 to the UK. I don&#039;t know what else to say really. If you don&#039;t go there once in your life then all I can say is you&#039;ve missed out one of the most special amazing things life has to offer.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got family that work in the travel industry and I&#039;ve been to most places around the world now, but still for me nothing touches on Ibiza.

In fact my understanding is that in certain territories like the Caymans there is actual legal provision to state that the government is not entitled to see the financial records of a bank so in the absence of a court order I think the vendors would be much better off. <br /><br />Another advantage of course is that you can open bank accounts denominated in all major currencies USD, GBP, EUR, CHF and so on so as you say you could contend with Intersango very easily. Of course there is the issue of extra processing times and wire transfer fees but I don&#039;t see any reason the exchange couldn&#039;t have a business account in the US/UK/EU as well to make such payments.<br /><br />The issue of initial capital is a worry but if you did go ahead with this I&#039;d suggest you actually start selling off stock for it on GLBSE - it&#039;s in every vendors interest for an exchange like this to exist. Moreover, as you say the very creation of the exchange itself could trigger a run on the existing exchanges as happened when BTC China launched which could drive up the price of the Bitcoin - the beauty of that of course is only you would know when the exchange would launch so you could make a King&#039;s ransom through this alone!<br /><br />Another suggestion might be to offer a &quot;cash out&quot; option, which would be easy to set up and implement if you were actually living in this location where the proceeds from the sale of the BTC are transferred to the exchange&#039;s own bank account and then withdrawn as cash over the counter to be sent to the mailing address of the vendor&#039;s choice by registered mail - perhaps this would be impractical for very large amounts though? In the department where I work many clients still use banker&#039;s drafts which are nearly as anonymous.<br /><br />If you do decide to go ahead, please do let me know if there&#039;s anything I can do to help, even if it&#039;s only convincing vendors of the necessity for such an exchange!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				In very basic terms you are correct but there is a lot more to it than that, for example, banking in the Caymans is an absolute no-no when you want to avoid tax let alone launder money nowadays.

I imagine in the next three years another cryptocurrency will be formed to run in parallel with the Bitcoin although what kind of rate of exchange there&#039;ll be between it and the BTC remains to be seen. Of course there are &quot;Freecoins&quot; and &quot;Strongcoins&quot; already but am I right in thinking they never took off because they&#039;re too closely regulated?<br /><br />As you say the Bitcoin is as susceptible to the law of supply and demand as any other currency - there&#039;s certainly a demand for a currency that does the job of Bitcoin but we&#039;re not wedded to it any more than you or I are wedded to the Pound - all major currencies accepted :)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The Chinese were fucking SMART to keep devaluing their Yuan because it&#039;s reason why the West has made China the center of the universe for manufacturing which is what is sustaining their economic miracle. What people don&#039;t realise is that now China has had such growth and now the Red Dragon&#039;s society is shifting so rapidly (the emergence of the Chinese middle class, improving living conditions, migration to the cities etc) that China doesn&#039;t just want to sustain their growth and it&#039;s % of annual growth every year, it HAS TO and it&#039;s TERRIFIED of the consequences if it doesn&#039;t. China&#039;s devaluation of it&#039;s currency isn&#039;t just an exorcize in keeping the West sweet, it&#039;s an exorcise in self preservation due in the fear of losing control of their own society. <br /><br />And yeah I agree it wont be that cut and dry, like I said these things have yet to be revealed. Personally I hope that the BTC is allowed to carry one and become a stable long-lasting currency. <br /><br />Lim

				Personally, I&#039;m torn between wanting to live somewhere remote versus living somewhere with a good internet connection ... that&#039;s sad I know, but it really is high on my priority list.<br /><br />I would say the Virgin Islands. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s the same for British citizens as Puerto Rico is for American citizens, where we don&#039;t need a passport to travel there. Any Caribbean island would be interesting, amazing beaches, lot&#039;s of interesting places to visit inland, is a short distance away from Cuba which having now opened up is a budding criminal hotspot, short flight to the Bahamas or Miami for heavenly night clubs.<br /><br />Then given your love of bing, you&#039;re on the doorstep to South America. Only downside I can see would be hurricanes and shipping anything out would take quite a while I&#039;d imagine, maybe not.

It would be southern Oregon, you have northern California weather (wine country) without the insane California taxes, on the ocean and can drive south if you want the beach, drive east if you want mountains, and legalization of marijuana with a limit of 24 plants iirc, much higher than California&#039;s limit.

				I think someone already mentioned it but I wonder if you&#039;ve thought about Uruguay? I&#039;ve heard that it&#039;s really easy to become a resident and the government there is very limited and nowhere near as invasive as ones in supposedly free countries such as the UK (I live here too) or the US.<br /><br />I totally get what you mean about wanting to leave the UK too. I can&#039;t wait until I&#039;m old enough to just pack up and leave - I mean what is it with these ridiculous laws like the communications data bill? It seems people here don&#039;t care about their privacy, or anything else for that matter.
