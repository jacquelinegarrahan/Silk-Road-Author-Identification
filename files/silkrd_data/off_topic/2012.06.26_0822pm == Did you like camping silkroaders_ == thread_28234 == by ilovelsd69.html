				Hi everyone! I come back from a 3 days camping trip and it was really fun, i brought some weed, beers and LSD with me, the first day was the national day here and we made a big fire while getting high on LSD with some friends, drinking some beers. This night was incredible and the all week end was so relaxing just drinking beers and making fires. I have decided&nbsp; to do that every national day from now on. There&#039;s nothing that relax me more than camping in the nature. Do you enjoy camping like i do people ?

				Camping is great!<br /><br />And yes, hotel suites are great also!<br /><br />Sadly, I mean, happily, I don&#039;t have any other bitches! I mean, my Missus is not a bitch - she is in the rap sense of the word. My little ho! But enough of that! <br /><br />Camping is great and a man can think things over.<br /><br />In a hotel suite, with some hooker riding your dick and an 8 ball of coke, maybe you don&#039;t want to think!<br /><br />But each man has his moments he wants to be quiet and away from it all.<br /><br />Me and the guys camped for years.<br /><br />Some even camped all summer, but growing a little weed they grew attached when it was a successful outdoor crop. They went feral but it was worth it when they harvested. Camping out with a crop would be great.<br /><br />Plant some seeds or clones near the site. Return Autumn. Its like a date - waiting for the action to start! <br /><br />Seriously though, every man ought to be able to live off the land.<br /><br />Just camp near a good restaurant! <br /><br />Or for some - a whorehouse!<br /><br />Never took coke camping but the missus has. I like it myself - she gets horny and wants to tie me up. So I, well, best not dwell on that.<br /><br />I camp out on my own a lot also. I piss on my campfire to put it out. Nothing better than being out there under the stars in the fresh air with a nice bit of hash. I like a pipe outdoors. Makes me look like Sherlock Holmes, but a stoned one who would likely get the wrong baddy hung and marry a murderess if I have not already!&nbsp; :(<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
