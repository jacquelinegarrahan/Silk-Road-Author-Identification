				Hey Guys, <br /><br />So I want to buy a 10 packs off a vendor very soon, no I am not a troll I have bought many lbs off of here before. I am sick of having go keep deposting coins on coins and getting new drops, so I want to buy 10 at once. My problem is that once I do so it is going to take me quit some time to get rid of it all, bc a lot of my old guys stopped dealing. Obviously it will be shipped to me in 1lb increments in triple sealed vacuum seal bags. I heard I can put these bags in the freezer? i just don&#039;t want the bud to dry out in the sealed bags. Any advice is appreciated.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Guys<br />Nuggets5

				Cannabis flowers are best kept long term stored in a cool/dry environment. Vacuum sealing helps to preserve the moisture content, however it is not necessary. The buds will gradually become darker, but potency will remain intact. I have kept weed for over 2 years in jars and plastic bags. The bud must be cured properly for long term storage ,otherwise you will end up with moldy schwag. I am vaping on a strain called Dutch Treat currently which is around 1.8 years old.

				Do not put the bud in the freezer this will knock the trichomes off and ruin the product.<br /><br />Just put the weed in glass jars with a lid and store in a cool and dark place, it will be good for years this way.<br /><br />Take it from me I have been growing for a long time.

				Thanks Guys, and special thanks to Dingo +1. I will probably order from either kensho or darkexpresso. From what I gathered, I will buy lots of large pickle jars and stuff the weed in those and store in a damp cool environment. Thank everyone for the help!

				you can keep bud in vac bags for quite a while, but look into c-vaults from freshstor. their humidors for ur buds keeps em perfect consistency, humidity, and minimizes shake. also seems to bring out flavors better. cool product a little pricy but if your storing some lbs shouldnt be outta ur price range. the biggest one the sell will hold 2 lbs of fluffy chronic medical buds with extra space in it.

				Alright, I went ahead and got 20 or the ultra large Ball jars, that should hold 5 pounds. I&#039;ll have to locate some more in my area, I was sketched out buying so many at one time, so I had other people go in and do it for me haha.<br /><br /><br />Thanks guys

				If you need to store longer, I&#039;ve been using 72% Boveda Packs attached to the inside top of my jars. When I used the higher % ones I did have some issues but since I went to the 72% humidity packs there has been no mold and the buds in stay in primo condition. They are cheap and last a few months.&nbsp; Just check on them from time to time and when they get rigid, just toss it and pop in a new one. Easy peasy japanesey!

				Not to knock darkexpresso as he is great, but iv bought from both and can honestly say ken has superior quality. If you do buy from kensho don&#039;t forget to review the bud and if you could drop me a line on how the transaction went maybe how much you spent I would greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />Chaos

It&#039;s crazy that an airsoft gun is in the the highest / worst category, along with machine guns, etc, because they are &quot;unregisterable.&quot;<br />You&#039;d be better off being caught with an unregistered handgun than an airsoft gun. In QLD now, any possession of a unregistered gun without a license is mandatory prison. It&#039;s either 6 or 12 months. So having an airsoft gun can land you in jail. Welcome to Australian law.<br /><br />I bought one overseas once, from a toy store. I was gunna bring it back with me, but when I saw how harsh the penalty is if you get caught with it, I just dumped it.<br />I even got someone to shoot me with it from a few metres away. It gave me a slight sting, but didn&#039;t hurt me at all. It&#039;s absurd how they are even illegal, let alone being in the same class as automatic weapons.

				Actually, if your caught with real steel, and its been registered before, but serial number is rubbed off, they cant charge you with an unregistered firearm, because its already been registered. Its a loop hole they have trying to fill...crazy huh?<br /><br />Well airsoft doesnt kill people, and the laws here are crazy. Its because they are exact replicas, thats half of the attraction to it.<br /><br />If australia were to ever have airsoft legalized, gas blow back semi-auto pistols would be a no-no. So it wouldnt be worth having it legalized here.<br /><br />Look at NZ, poor bastards lost their full-auto option for airsoft, because some kid sprayed a house who was on holidays from the USA.<br />Ruined it for a whole country. Semi-auto only is stupid and actually bad for the AEG gearboxes, they last longer on full-auto, thats what they were made for. If your sniping, single shot is great.<br /><br />Anyway i never take my airsoft out, only for the skirmish.

				Don&#039;t put it in the freezer. If the weed has not been cured and dried properly be very careful it doesn&#039;t go moldy. If its been dried properly just store it in a jar out of the light.
