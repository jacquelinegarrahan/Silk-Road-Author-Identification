				I smoke an e-cig because I am trying to quit smoking. <br /><br />The one that I use is made up of 3 parts, A battery, an atomizer and a cartridge that I fill up with a mixture of pure nicotine, Propylene Glycol or Glycerine, and flavoring. Generally the concentrates they sell for making hard candy! yum, I love my Apple and coke flavored mix. <br /><br />Anyway I have grown to love vaping as its called, its like having your own shisha with you all the time, you can switch flavours when you want and you get thick lush yummy smoke out of it that satisfies your craving and dosent kill you. The liquid is wicked from the reservoir to the atomizer via a small wick this is why the substance must dissolve and not form a precipitate. <br /><br />Right the resevior that I fill up is about the size of a AAA battery. I guess I could fit around 2CCÂ´s of P.G or Glycerine in there. Since you are allowed to smoke this on planes, trains, restaurants, work etc.. legally. I was thinking of making it interesting. <br /><br />I am looking for any drugs that will stay in solution / dissolve into P.G or glycerine and that are not denatured by the heat that the atomiser gets to in order to create the vapour... I have put one drop of water with methamphetamine dissolved directly on the atomizer and had a puff and it was like a very strong pipe hit. <br />I ask this with the view of perhaps selling e-cigarette bundles on SR with pre-filled cartridges made to order with your drug and flavour of choice :D Just imagine being able to sit on a plane and slyly take a puff of your electronic cigarette filled with DMT, you could trip away with your eyes closed and no one would be the wiser. or puff away on methamphetamine at work, your employers would just think you are quitting smoking! <br />&nbsp;<br />Right, so any suggestions / comments would be welcome<br /><br />ACE<br />

				Lol I &#039;ve been thinking about this and if it is possible.<br /><br />I &#039;ve seen a post on dmt-nexus and some guys have tried DMT-PG mixtures with success, and the atomizers temperature might be ideal for DMT vaporization.<br />I don&#039;t think there will be any problem with heat since the cartridge is a bit away from the coil, but I don&#039;t know if most drugs can stay in solution/dissolve with PG.<br />Anyway its very interesting... hoping for some answers too.

				I regularly use meth and THC in my e-cig - they both work great although, esp with the thick sticky THC, its good to experiment with different cartridges/cartomizers to see what works best.&nbsp; Ive done a little MDMA that way too, but not really enough to have formed an opinion.&nbsp; Maybe ill go mix some up now and try again.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Syn
