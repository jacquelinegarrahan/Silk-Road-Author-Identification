				But at the same time I love it (sometimes). Tried to do that several hours ago with mxe. Snorted ~225mg and then another ~50mg an hour and a half later. I didn&#039;t hole, so I was just kinda left dancing by myself to some obscure &#039;80s new wave (perfect for disassociative highs) for two hours afterward. =/<br /><br />I wished I was at a rave, but at the same time I felt great anyhow. So euphoric!<br /><br />... Yeah this topic is kind of pointless.

				~225mg? Are you really big or is it a weak batch? Or both?<br /><br />Just curious cause that sounds like an insane amount.

				Now that I think about it he probably meant &quot;25&quot; not &quot;225&quot;, but it&#039;s more fun to think godzilla does mxe.

				lol...<br /><br />I only weigh 140, but I&#039;m pretty healthy and active, and on top of that I seem to be naturally resistant to some drugs. On top of that I&#039;ve built a tolerance. Or maybe the mxe I was using from awakened is just weak. Or my scale could be broke. Dunno really.

				i miss mxe. haven&#039;t done it since march when i did way too much. i was already fucked up and i kept snorting it because i felt like it wasn&#039;t going up my nose oh god. don&#039;t remember much, but i was covered in mysterious scrapes and bruises. <br /><br />it&#039;s a good thing that happened to me though, because i was abusing it really bad and i needed to be turned off it for my sanity&#039;s sake. <br />
