				Do you guys know any good place where one could hide drugs? My problem is that I&#039;ve been keeping the stuff in my car, since my wife cleans up the house and I&#039;m afraid she would find it there and flush it down the toilet. On the other hand both house and car appear dangerous in case there should ever be any law enforcement checks. <br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about burying them in the garden, since that way there would be no proof of me having put them there, maybe put a sealed plastic box into the earth in the garden? I&#039;m talking about a couple of grams for consumption here, which I want to keep away from both my wife and law enforcement in case either comes checking. Digging around in the garden appears kind of weird and impractical as well and at night all kinds of bums + animals enter the garden.<br /><br />You know any place where the possibility of finding it is low and even if it&#039;s found there is no clear connection that would stand up in court between you and the stuff + where it is easy to retrieve when you want to consume (like not in some forrest or hole 3 miles away)?

The same with some weird room in the cellar my wife is afraid to go in because of spiders etc., still this would clearly place the stuff in my place and possession, also easy to find in case you can sniff it.<br /><br />So I think it must be some place outside where one can say one has never seen the stuff and wasn&#039;t aware somebody must have hid drugs there. At the same time it has to be close enough one can easily reach it when one wants to consume. Maybe buy a small sealed plastic container and hide it under some dirt in the backyard?

				if it is that small, pull up a small corner of carpeting in a closet or similar place and stick it in there. Also, if you have heavy drapes, the kind with the weights in the bottom, inside the hem is is good, too.

The theoretical problem remains that drugs like meth could be sniffed out by dogs (I guess?). Don&#039;t know if the police once they suspect something regarding narcotics come with dogs to search your place? <br /><br />Then again law enforcement seems to often be unbelievably incompetent. Like I remember reading somewhere in an interview with Boston George Jung that when they arrested him and raided his villa he had 300 kg! of cocaine stashed away in the chimney of his villa, which the cops never even noticed, so all they ended up arresting him for was a couple of ounces of Coke that were distributed for his birthday party guests spread around on serving trays in his villa. Of course that was 30 years ago.

				I really wouldn&#039;t be worrying about police searching your house with dogs. I don&#039;t know where you live but in the US cops aren&#039;t just going to come tear your house apart because they suspect that you are a recreational drug user... or even if they know for a fact that you are. Unless you&#039;re dealing or something. <br /><br />So it seems the only issue is hiding from your wife, which shouldn&#039;t be too difficult. You&#039;ve already come up with some good ideas.<br /><br />When I was a youngin&#039; I was so paranoid that my parents would find my pot stash that I lifted up the corner of the carpet inside of my closet, drilled a hole into the wood flooring, attached a string to my bag and dangled it down underneath the floor. So unnecessary haha, I wonder what they will think when they re-carpet the room. :D

				Power adapters... Not sure that&#039;s what there called in the USA but here in Australlia thats what we call them..<br /><br />on the back should be a little screw, undo that and open it up..<br /><br />Put your stuff inside, i put my caps and roll up my baggies and fit them snuggly in there..<br /><br />Put it back together and screw it back up and your done :)<br /><br />maybe lightly mark it so you know which power adapter you&#039;ve used

				My Top Five places to stash:<br /><br />5. Safe or Lockbox - I know, way to obvious but at least no one can find out the contents while you&#039;re gone with out leaving a trace, (unless they have the key/code).<br /><br />4. Improvised Stash compartments in plain sight. A computer case like previously mentioned, or a video game contrller, Speakers work great, especially the Bass, as long as you don&#039;t plan on using said stash compartment. Duct tapes to unnoticeable parts of perhaps a cabinet or hidden compartment, you could also make a hidden compartment in a bag or suitcase or even between the lining of your clothes. Deoderant, Dental Floss, and other household items that are personal and not commonly used by anyone but you. <br /><br />3. Burying it, rather than in your backyard garden like you mentioned, why not get an indoor plant or better yet a synthetic indoor plant, pull out the big fake soil and carve a hole in there to put your stuff. I wouldn&#039;t reccomend your garden, that&#039;s for bodies. Jk<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Decorations Not a vase of some sort unless the mouth is small enough you can&#039;t see what&#039;s inside. But statuettes with a built in shelf would be a good idea, look for one with barely noticeable seems or the lines of the shelf look like they&#039;re part of the design. Furniture, not so much as inside but maybe attached to the back or underneath something against a wall where you&#039;d only clean in spring. Whoever even looks at the back of a washing machine or the fridge except the repairman? Which is probably you anyways, lol kidding, or not...<br /><br />1. Hidden compartments in your house - Vents, Ducts, or take a knife and cut open the carpet, break open the floor boards, throw away the materials (also previously mentioned) and then put a shelf or your stash plant on top of it! However a rotating bookcase that leads to a room with a 7&quot; thick titanium blast door and a retinal scanner is preferable.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Also try to keep whatever you got in a mason jar if possible for preservation and smell! Dryer sheets and Silica packets work great, next time you&#039;re forced to go shopping or whatever, just go to the shoe section and open up boxes and take the packets, I also found some really cool big packets inside suitcases and backpacks at the mall.
