				I know im going to feel guilty for saying this, but i kinda hope that he, and those others who get sent back end up in the chair.<br />It would sure as hell send a message that these so called muslim clerics cant just infiltrate a western country and promote terrorism.<br />My only fear is of something kicking off in the uk in response to them getting shipped out.

				I just glanced over who he is. It seems like the vast majority of his crimes are not illegal under USA law. We have freedom of speech and freedom of press. What exactly is he being extradited for?

				Ah I see he had more recent charges that are actually warranting of being called crimes. His previous charges were for things that would not be illegal in the USA though (hate speech, having terrorist propaganda, etc).

				The only issue I see arising here is not one of human rights but it&#039;s going to be a bastard to find a human pinata that has that much surface area to hit again. I mean who the fuck else has 2 hook hands like that in the U.K?

				i am glad that he is getting extradited its what he deserves for inciting hate.<br /><br />but i think the biggest issue atm is the muslim guys gangraping girls in UK cities.<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-18540902<br /><br />grooming, this isnt a single isolated incident, its something thats becoming serious.<br /><br />this video talks about how its almost a cover up <br /><br /><br />http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCkQtwIwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dan-DgorV8HM&amp;ei=_xhwUI3KOYfB0QX33oCQBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAS9TLeqE6Pm0Dhu2FKzrgK_wApQ<br /><br />

				It&#039;s a bit ridiculous that it took so long and was such a fraught process. The guy is ugly as sin, not British and spent most of his time here drumming up support for Al Qaida.. Well, he&#039;s off to the States now. The only country with a worse human rights record than China. Have fun.....
