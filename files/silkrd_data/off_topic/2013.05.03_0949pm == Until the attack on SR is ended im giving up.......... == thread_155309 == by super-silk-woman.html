				Yes, it is starting to look like TorMail now, isn&#039;t it. (Which was up last night by the way) As soon as I start to think it is up for another 30 days it is down again. The messages are 10% sexier....<br /><br />Sorry, an error was encountered.<br /><br />We could not process your request. (ext)<br /><br />.... but still down. Don&#039;t give up shaving your legs though. And try waxing, it isn&#039;t painful if the hairs are still short, it&#039;s a much smoother feel and lasts a bit longer. ;)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Thats the whole point. Kind of silly but when I saw the ad I thought about how it could be applied to SR but it cant really. Just something to pass the time. Until SR is back up and running :P<br /><br />I dont really know or understand the technical aspects of the attack but what is happening and why cant it be prevented? <br /><br />I thought of a few what ifs but this is just my imagination so I have no proof of anything. In fact im asking about these things not making any claims to them being fact or anything like that.<br />&nbsp;<br />Is this attack so people would start using the other sites available? I remember when SR went down hard last year and people were going to BMR (and getting robbed A LOT too I might add) then when SR came back up BMR went back to being what it was.<br />It wouldnt take a genius to figure out if you gave people an option that was better than BMR and SR was unavailable they would go there and if you can get the vendors to put up ads you can get the customers. Especially if this is their main source and they are facing withdraw without it.<br />If a competitor site (started) with LOW rates for becoming a vendor and had low fees for listings.<br />Then knock SR down and keep knocking it down until you frustrate the customers enough to head over there.<br /><br />I also was thinking about how SR affects the BTC value and if you can knock down SR and lower the value and then buy low you would make a profit on the uprise. Especially when SR comes back to normal. Then you could sell at a high.<br /><br />Is any of this even a possibility? Who would want to do this? An angry SR customer? Seems a little harsh and unrealistic. An angry hacker group? Who? Dont they claim what they do usually? LE wouldnt do this would they? <br /><br />Ive said it before but I will say it again I am loyal to SR until the end. I may someday entertain the idea of other sites but im confident this attack will pass and SR will be back to normal soon enough.<br />Also I wont put my trust in something new when I already have something established that I can trust. Thats just my opinion&nbsp; :-* <br />

				During the winter months I would happily oblige (usually do anyway) but I simply cannot support this given that it&#039;s recently been beautiful where I am and I&#039;ve busted out the summer dresses.

Like you said though, it has been going on a long, long time. Before November, incidentally. Who would have that kind of money to sustain a year-long attack? What motivation? I guess it depends on whether the attacks from last year and this year are from the same source. If it IS friom the same people then they are certainly well funded and dug in to the point of going beyond short-term customer base expansion, but that is just my opinion.<br /><br />(Try Veet. :) )<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.
