				So in early March, I purchased some LSD from a reputable vendor. It didn&#039;t arrive, so we agreed to file deadline extension tickets; but pretty soon it was mid-April and the product still hadn&#039;t arrived.<br /><br />The seller offered me a 50% refund, which I accepted.<br /><br />It&#039;s now late June. I went to check my mail, and found an international package. Within it was the product I&#039;d ordered in early March. It was a very nice surprise as I&#039;ve been without acid for ages.<br /><br />Anybody have similar experiences? Should I inform the seller as an act of courtesy? I currently can&#039;t repay the 50% refund I got, though to be honest a 50% discount seems fair for an item that arrived four months late.

				I have had a order that is 10 days late, but 4 months is a really long time.<br />Keep your money, and enjoy your trip.

				Send him a thank you and update your feedback. I wouldn&#039;t offer to pay as you had to wait so long, but a thank you and feedback repair is plenty!

I presume it was the international mailing system that fucked up, given how other reviews of the vendor are overwhelmingly positive.<br /><br />The only other time I waited a long while for an order was from Lucydrop; and given how Lucydrop was a gigantic scammer, the product that arrived was 10 blotters with the strength of two.

I guess it&#039;s not his fault though. Keep your money and enjoy your abnormally late acid.

				If I were a vendor I would tell you to keep the money anyway as it is too long to reasonably wait for product but I would also politely remind you I had actually sent them and you were &quot;free to do business&quot; with me as I hadn&#039;t ripped you off (not the best way to write it but im stoned and you get my drift right ?)

I was making a separate point. No amount of customer service and reassurance would convince me to put myself in a situation where I spent 4 weeks waiting for a package and thinking I lost 50% of my money for nothing.. There are other vendors out there.

I&#039;d wanted to order changa from this vendor (as I could never properly smoke DMT crystals), but I&#039;m not thinking that&#039;s a good idea given how long it took my acid to arrive.
