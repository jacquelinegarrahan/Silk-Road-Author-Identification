				It&#039;s well known that this guy never pays back anything.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give him any money.&nbsp; Just look at his karma, that&#039;s because he has nothing better to do than beg on forums all day.

				Seriously, I will give you the darwin award just for killing yourself.&nbsp; If you somehow find a woman as stupid and worthless as yourself willing to breed with you then I fear doom for the species.&nbsp; If you&#039;re too stupid to figure out how to kill yourself I will start a bitcoin fund to buy you a gun.

				How do you rationalize spending so much time begging for small change?&nbsp; You don&#039;t even make minimum wage.&nbsp; Do you even realize how pathetic you are?<br /><br />I feel like I should study you as a specimen for how low a human can go.&nbsp;

				You don&#039;t have 30 bitcoins, just answer the questions please.&nbsp; Or is that how you manage to have good self image, by ignoring every negative thought that pops up in your head about the sad nature of your actions?

				Dude, you&#039;re not fooling anyone, give it up already.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that you do have 30 btc then yes you did beg for them all, but you don&#039;t have 30 btc or you wouldn&#039;t have been begging for 0.2 for a sample.&nbsp; Please just answer the questions.

				Hahahaha, I&#039;m sure you did&nbsp; ;D.&nbsp; If someone gave you the money and posts here(not a 4 post count newb posting though) I will give you .5 btc.&nbsp; That ought to get you drooling since it&#039;s more than you&#039;ve made in the past week.&nbsp; Please answer the questions though, I think you&#039;re just in denial and therefore ignore everything negative like I said before.

				Yop called you out lovestotrip and he is 100% correct in what he has said. ::) Your scamming good natured people out of&nbsp; small amounts of BTC over numerous threads using a variety of user names on this forum. Now you&#039;ve been busted, scamming generous members, with your details to be sent to mods shortly. You don&#039;t happen to know Steve123 by any chance? Mmmm!!

				That is a real quote that YOP posted from another user on the forums in another thread lovestotrip made about a week ago asking for .2BTC fro a sample he wanted. You know he didn&#039;t make up a fake quote you just thought other people are stupid enough to belive you when you say &quot;nice job making a fake quote&quot;, which is to try and make it sound like he is lying and not you but you forgot people know you.
