				I like the idea. I think SR needs more lotto&#039;s as well...<br /><br />&nbsp;I get what you are saying though, completely. <br /><br />Some people here have A LOT OF MONEY... Most have so much they don&#039;t know what to do with it...<br /><br />Why not get on the forums and donate to some members that truly deserve it or run a lotto?<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s because it&#039;s not a tax write off lmao! :P

Mad props to you.. you know who you are!!<br /><br />so yea, i&#039;m on here all the time anyways.. so i can do all the researching on prospectice&nbsp; ticket holders (to avoid a prize going to someone unfitting), updating ongoing events, answer pm&#039;s and such.. :P<br />i am soooo down!!<br />and to show my downess.. i&#039;ll start by emptying my SR wallet!! a grand total of .019&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />please feel free to pm me if you&#039;ve got some bomb ideas, or if you want to tell me how dumb i am!!<br /><br />seriously, thank you for all the positive feedback!!<br /><br />much love!!<br />be safe!!

				I think this is a great idea.. <br /><br />&nbsp;It might be hard to get off the ground at first but some of us could really use a hand up not a hand out.. LOL.. <br /><br />I know a lot of people here have been let go from their &quot;day&quot; jobs and are just trying to get by and make a buck were they can and a few bitcoins coins for some of us could be a life changer for a month or so.. <br /><br />I&#039;m down ..

				<br />you are all the awesome people i&#039;m referring to!!<br /><br />so, the next step would be to create a wallet either as an SR buyer account or another wallet.. but so we&#039;re clear.. i do NOT want to be in charge of pooling and paying out winnings.. i don&#039;t want anyone thinking for a second that i&#039;m in this for myself!! so, any volunteers would be awesome!!<br /><br />any additional info/ advice??<br /><br />much love!!<br />peace!!

				sweetness!!<br />when i feel there are enough interested parties.. and if no one wants to volunteer to run deposits/ payouts.. i&#039;ll just do it!!<br /><br />but i&#039;ve been thinking about how to keep it so everyone who buys in knows no scam is going on.. and haven&#039;t really figured it out!! because it would have to be through a buyers account, and therefore, essentially it would initially be entirely on trust.. so, to ease that stress, i could edit the OP including all buy in&#039;s and their amount donated.. so everything is accounted for.. i dunno!!<br /><br />then the winner(s) chosen randomely..<br /><br />i dunno..<br />i&#039;m tired!!<br /><br />peace!!

				I don&#039;t have a sellers account, YET, but will in the next coming months.. At that time I would not mind running it but on the sellers front I am of no use as of yet, But I am happy to help out in any way needed.. <br /><br />&nbsp;I will ponder on tactics for making this go easy and what the best method is for the entire thing..

				I think the best way would be to use a vendor account. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to be 100% guarded against anyone just running off with the money but if it is a vendor it seems to me that it would be much much less likely and probably only happen if that vendor was already going to go poof. It would not be good to just blatantly screw people in need after offering to help facilitate, I&#039;m not sure if you can work out the logistics to get it under the umbrella of SR official business, but then you could count on a ban to help keep them honest.

				<br />soooo stoked to see all these positive responses!!<br /><br />i was thinking about how to implement some form of &#039;checks and balances&#039; to avoid just that..<br />maybe one party collects and pays out, while another party decides (hopefully randomly) the winners..<br /><br />i truly hope this pans out!!<br /><br />thank you, all of you!!

				Yeah I like the idea of a global SR lottery, Scurvy Crew would be up for donating say $250 if another 10 or so vendors donate the same then I guess $2500 would be a cool prize for someone with not much money. Also We could sell tickets at say 5 dollars each. if 500 people buy a ticket the prize fund could start looking interesting <br /><br />ACE - TSC

				<br />..and my seed is blossoming into a beaitiful fruit tree!!<br />we shall see if it bears any fruit..<br /><br />@WhiteOut<br />i am loving where your going with this!!<br />most importantly.. don&#039;t pm Ace regarding this thread!! he has enough going on.. and even though you have all been nurturing this wonderful idea, let&#039;s try to keep all ideas on this thread.. if you feel necessary, please pm me!!<br /><br />i would just like to see some sort of checks and balances implemented to prevent the lotto holding vendor (you, or whoever) to just say thppppppp and take the money!! an established vendor would be ideal.. <br /><br />but let me worry about contacting vendors.. i don&#039;t want any vendor getting uppity up with you over a seed i planted!!<br /><br />IMHO i think ticket purchasers should meet a loose criteria.. no new accounts, trolls, or shit listers!!<br /><br />much love!!<br />long live SR!!<br />peace!!

				I think the idea of Silk Road having a vendor account is brilliant as others have stated above :-). An account that does lotteries and giveaways.<br /><br />ANY form of give-away, lottery or free-be generates interest and traffic, that is just fact. If you start giving away coins and drugs people will flock, but not only that, original members will remain over BMR and Atlantis. Not dissing those sites, I like them both, but Silk Road will always be my true love.<br /><br />There are barely any lotteries anymore. Sometimes I used to log on just to see what ones there were, and sometimes I&#039;d save coins and wait untill the amount I had was enough to enter a lottery. It was exciting for me. They aren&#039;t a waste!!! There&#039;s a reason every country still runs lotteries :P!<br /><br />Everybody loves &#039;em.

				I have the best fucking idea ever.<br /><br />tell me if you guys think it would work...<br /><br />I was thinking of setting up a vendors profile.<br /><br />Sell tickets for $5 a pop to the whole SR community for a pot luck type thing.<br /><br />Have them FE.<br /><br />You can buy as many tickets as you would like.<br /><br />Have a lotto type drawing at the end of every week of 10 random #&#039;s and letters out of a hat.<br /><br />5 different #&#039;s<br /><br />5 different letters<br /><br />Whoever has most matching digits in their 10 digit transaction # for their ticket purchase wins the whole pot!<br /><br />You will pretty much never have a tie!<br /><br />Totally random, massive amounts of buyers, huge pot.<br /><br />Then on top of that shit, vendors can do run weekly ads on my vendors page in return for offering some extra free BTC or product to the winner.<br /><br />We can have a MASSIVE weekly pot built up in no time and have winners every week.<br /><br />I think this is a sick idea guys....<br /><br />Can I get your opinions?<br /><br />It will all be mostly forum based so everyone can keep track and I will be constantly updating here.<br /><br />I think this is the type of thing SR really needs for our community!<br /><br />I can get a vendor account going for this specific lottery if a lot of people would be down?

Only ONE ENTRY per person per drawing. I love the idea of using the transaction # for your &quot;lotto ticket.&quot; I also believe that there should be a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winner. My issue is HOW the numbers (0-9) and letters (a-f) since the transaction # is a HEX number will be drawn, and WHO will do the drawing. One idea is for SOMEONE to use this CLEARNET LINK:<br />http://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=5&amp;format=h<br />I can see scenarios where a group of people using teamviewer or similar software sharing their screen could generate the winning ticket while others watched, but then that defeats the anonymity aspect.

				Yeah, I mean we all had some good ideas but it&#039;s worth fuck all if we can&#039;t execute. I nominate you to be first candidate. Won&#039;t look good to choose yourself, but you&#039;re the one with the idea and mentioned you&#039;re in need. I&#039;ll throw a little bit your way.<br /><br />So basically this will limit it to people who have been around a while. Hopefully you guys in this thread are already aware of a number of people we could help so this could go a little while without much risk of anybody getting gamed. Maybe people could volunteer to be notified when a new person is chosen, or we could just use this thread as it will turn up on new replies, or new thread every time idk. I figure the more often we do it, the less BTC we will be able to drum up for each person. I mean I can&#039;t throw in much, probably whatever leftover BTC I have sitting around. So maybe every 2 weeks? I don&#039;t remember who offered the $250 but I think it would be bomb to split that up between like the first 5 people. Otherwise 1st person gets bank and next might get $25.

				My fear is that as soon as a vendor holds the lotto, it&#039;d appear to just be a vendor&#039;s lotto. I guess the vendor could make it abundantly clear that its a lotto by the community, for the community. Maybe he could provide a link to this thread in the item description but still. Too bad we can&#039;t just get http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/923820dcc5 to hold it. haha. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m not sure if the community voting would work.

				<br />After hearing what Libertas had to say, the whole concept of trying to do this &#039;lotto&#039; style seemed kinda&nbsp; dismal.. only because going through a vendor wasn&#039;t what i initially had in mind.. and any and all &#039;purchases&#039; must be through the SR system.. but there IS nothing wrong with giving coin away!!<br />I do appreciate what White0ut is doing.. but there are a ton of &#039;lotteries&#039; out there!!<br />I love the whole concept of the community choosing a winner!! Maybe via a poll er something..

ALL of you are straight noble for even chiming in!!<br />Let&#039;s keep this sanctuary and our true community members as solid and faithful as the original intention for SR!!

				murderface2012, I bet we&#039;d get along IRL.<br /><br />To be honest, I&#039;d rather have less money won at a time but more winners. I&#039;d like to see people having a 4/25 (aka 24/150) shot at winning $187.50 MUCH more than 1 lucky ass guy winning a ton of money/drugs. Yeah, $187.50 is less than $1,500 but its still a decent amount of money that was received for only a $10 ticket. We hear about people winning lotteries IRL and those very few bastards just live like kings. I&#039;m saying we should spread the wealth more.
