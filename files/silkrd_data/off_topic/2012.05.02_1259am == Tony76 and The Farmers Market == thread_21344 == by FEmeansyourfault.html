				&nbsp;:o So anyway a few months ago i was browsing forums bored out of my mind.&nbsp; I saw a thread tony76 had started i believe asking how to get on the farmers market.&nbsp; This was just after TFM stopped allowing anyone to join.&nbsp; He was asking how to get on,for a invite,etc. Seeing how back then SR showed the spot the vendor was in (tony76 being #1) theres not much doubt someone,somewhere jumped at the chance to help tony76 get onto TFM.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I have never bought anything from him,but i wonder if the last comfirmed orders to arrive from tony76 would be close to the time frame of the TFM bust?&nbsp; Maybe the last confirmed order from him was sent out the day of or days close to TFM being busted.&nbsp; Him running sell,talking about new products,this and that could have been the police.&nbsp; They have every right to use his computer and tell whomever whatever they want to further thier case, like &quot;FE im trustedby everyone,im number one&quot;. Then they have umpteen more leads to watch/follow. Also they get to keep the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;I know every cop shop would sell thier first born for crack at that,plus resources would pour in from every corner faster than they could blow them.&nbsp; Also about that bullshit&quot;if he was busted there would be a news story about it&quot; &quot;Someone would take credit for it&quot;.&nbsp; And that may be the case at the end of the case against tony76 and everyone connected to him.&nbsp; During the case however no stories will be told,no police body will take credit.&nbsp; Seeing how tony76 also had H from the middle east,the GOV could label him terrorist suspect,i.e money laundering.&nbsp; <br /><br />If that happens the sun and sky become distant memories for him,and the info surrounding him disappears. Any situation i see doesnt look good for anyone involved including SR.&nbsp; People that bought from him might want to go mailess for awhile. or have it sent not to you .&nbsp; Funny shit so many FE even though there has been 100,000 posts saying never too. Just my two cents.&nbsp; PS if you have bought from someone 100 times and still dont know thier first name your not friends,your dealer/user.

				http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/international-online-drug-market-busted-arrests_n_1429544.html<br /><br />No one from Canada was arrested as far as I can tell. All these conspiracy theories need to stop. Everyone for some reason wants to avoid the truth of what happened here: Tony took our money. End of story. No cops, no sudden death or injuries, no computer going down, no extended vacation, it was just a scam.

				Tony was not selling anything from the farmer&#039;s market, so if he bought from the farmer&#039;s market it was for his own personal use. Tony&#039;s stuff is TONS better than Joot&#039;s cid, and while I feel bad for Joot, it isn&#039;t a loss for this community.<br /><br />No need to worry. :)
