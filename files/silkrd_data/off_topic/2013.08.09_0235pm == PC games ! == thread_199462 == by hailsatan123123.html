				I&#039;m dedicating this thread to my favorite computer games, They are a big part of my life and i like to spend most of my spare time playing them !~<br /><br />Ive been in World of Warcraft for about 6 years.&nbsp; Spent most of my time playing PvP arena and raiding, I had more than a year and a half of game play and i have to admit it was the most addictive thing ive ever got sucked into.<br />Dota I/II , One of the best PvP games in my opinion , Team have to be well coordinated, It&#039;s a classic 5v5 with only 1 map to choose, You have to be familiar with more than 40 hero characters each of them have their own set of skills - This game is free via steam !<br />Heroes of might and magic III , Never gets old! never gets boring. <br />Red Alert II , Classic and fun <br /><br />

				Man I miss WoW, I hopped on the WoW wagon only by lich king, quit right before cataclysm and only had a 75 Deathknight and didn&#039;t couldn&#039;t get the new game because I was saving money... but played on private servers time to time a year back. <br /><br />I used to play runescape as a kid, good game but now theres too much.. I had dota 2 but didn&#039;t play it much, Skyrim, Oblivion is just amazing as well, Fallout 3 and new vegas...black ops, kindom of amalur, gah tons more games...<br /><br />But my gaming laptop had issues and had a long life I must say. But the game I probably played the most would be WoW
