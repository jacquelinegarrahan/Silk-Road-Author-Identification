				I started thinking a lot about this after I had my first experience with a psychedelic a couple weeks ago. The experience was mentally moving for me and I felt like it reshaped my entire mental landscape including things I&#039;d been indoctrinated to believe since I was a child. I felt to some extent like I had emerged from a state of &quot;1984 doublethink.&quot; I was sort of pulled out of denial about some things. Since then I&#039;ve been finding myself thinking that psychedelics (and other drugs) would be something governments would inevitably want to control, not necessarily only to protect the population from harm,&nbsp; but they would definitely want to control them because they make thought control/intimidation of the population difficult. It&#039;s hard to keep someone on a psychedelic in a mental box it seems.&nbsp; Once something breaks through all the fear and shame and guilt, what do you have to control people any more with ? I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one to be thinking along these lines! (It may not even be an original thought, my one friend who has experience with drugs also has pretty anarchist leanings so I&#039;m sure I connected the two things partly because of them). I&#039;d be interested in hearing others thoughts on this though.

				i think thats a very common thought to have when you&#039;re new to psychedelics.&nbsp; i once thought that.&nbsp; <br /><br />upon further consideration, though, i think it lends too much credibility and intelligence to the people who are &quot;in control&quot; if you can even call it that.&nbsp; I think that the truth is much more frightening than the idea of us being under some sort of mind control through religion and government and whatnot (which is true to a small extent)...the real scary part, is that no one is in control.&nbsp; the world is just a great big jungle filled with organisms eating other organisms and dancing on like that from generation to generation through the eternity of time.<br /><br />what i&#039;m trying to say is, there&#039;s no great evil wizard trying to keep us all under a spell.&nbsp; its all smoke and mirrors and sleight of hand trickery on the part of the media, governments, churches, etc, who&#039;s sole objective is to get your money...nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp; <br /><br />if you free your mind, then it is free.&nbsp; &quot;they&quot; can&#039;t even comprehend what that means.&nbsp; &nbsp;acid was made illegal simply because it was weirding out the squares.&nbsp; there&#039;s no conspiracy to keep you in the dark.&nbsp; &quot;they&quot; don&#039;t even know they are in the dark.&nbsp; their third eye has never been opened.<br /><br />but the age of one million buddhas is upon us, and we will commence shiva&#039;s dance of destruction on this sillyness.&nbsp; religion and civilization were merely tools to unite us as species.&nbsp; now that we are united they serve little purpose and will soon be destroyed.

Well the church was/is also used as a mechanism of political control. Some people think that the population is being controlled by propaganda. I don&#039;t think the church would be happy if people started mentally breaking out of their boxes.<br />

				As controversial as it may be to say it, I don&#039;t believe psychedelics should be made available to the mainstream public. That being said, I don&#039;t support the efforts by our government to stop people from using them via means of fear, imprisonment and violence. Psychedelics are extremely strong and open up your &quot;third eye&quot;, and if that third eye is crusty it can be more than someone can handle to have it opened up wide after all these years of taking a nap.<br />I&#039;ve encountered many people who could use a hit of weed to put their rat race into perspective but rarely do I encounter an average joe for whom I would recommend trying out a psychedelic. These are things you must seek out when you feel mentally ready for them. Think about your average unenlightened frat boy or office drone buying a few hits of L with his 6-pack, the world would be ass backwards with psychs being just another drug to get &quot;wasted&quot; on. When people start seeking the truth and the third eye expansion of consciousness, they will seek psychedelics. And when there&#039;s a will, there&#039;s a way.

				psychedelics are a tool, government types fear psychedelics because it introduces an x factor into the equations they use to control the public.&nbsp; if the ruling elite have the chance to make money by making something illegal -then prosecuting the offenders, they will do so with no regard to good moral obligation. <br /><br />&nbsp;Last time i checked, government is the impetus to egotistical, they are one in the same, psychedelics promote ego loss... however if psychs where to saturate the world, that won&#039;t equal anarchism, it just means the government would have to spend more money and push a few extra buttons to sustain order with a iron fist.&nbsp; psychedelic use is a art like tai chi, which must be studied and practiced to gain great benefit..&nbsp; many of the hippies did master this practice; but most of them turned out to be simple charlatans. <br /><br />the government is egotistical, hence the illuminati comparisons(which are true by application)..&nbsp; they feed off that false sense of world domination and superiority, when in reality the workings of the world are completely organic and self perpetuating from engrained codes based off universal dna.&nbsp; They are parasitic viruses, but such virus can be observed within any framework.
