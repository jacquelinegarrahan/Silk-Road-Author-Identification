Next time you fund your account, buy more Bitcoin than you&#039;ll need to allow for Bitcoin fluctuations. I sincerely hope nobody helps you out this time so as you will perhaps learn something from this experience, or at least learn something from the massive withdrawal you seem to be undergoing.<br />Order less product if you can&#039;t afford to order the quantity you want. This is not a soup kitchen.<br /><br />I&#039;m 99% certain sdesu will not be helping you out here, and rightly so. Why should he pay for your drugs simply because you didn&#039;t have the foresight to buy enough Bitcoin to cover your order?! Stop begging, get a job / some other means of making money, and buy your own damn drugs.<br />I&#039;m sure you can buy more Bitcoin in the next few hours which will allow you to keep your account overfunded for your next purchase.<br /><br />Oh, and last but not least, desperately bumping your own thread is not looked on favourably here, especially when it&#039;s a begging thread.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
