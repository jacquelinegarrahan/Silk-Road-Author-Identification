				The whole deal with streetc101 was hilarious. I laughed hard when I saw your new avatar for the first time.<br /><br />Having said that...<br />Outing a member, as easy as it might have been, isn&#039;t something we want to do here. It weakens the community in many ways. We all deal with sensitive information about each other (packaging techniques, physical addresses, etc) and it is our responsibility to do what we can to keep everyone anonymous to the best of our abilities. I probably should have messaged you this when I saw your avatar.<br /><br />Another way to look at it is that yes, there was a victim to your action. No one is allowed to make a victim out of someone else in the agora.<br /><br />I saw some of this going on when vladimir dipped out. I don&#039;t know if that went unnoticed or not. Maybe it was ok because he fucked others over first? Could it be construed as some form of self defense in that case? I will have to chew on that for a moment.<br /><br /><br />Don&#039;t sweat it. So DPR made you walk the plank. Now you have a cool story, and hopefully learned something.

Any SR member who met with in real life would have been a fool, and yes, in order to protect said fools these attempts to lure them out should have been reported; the course of action you took went far beyond that.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />His face was plastered everywhere that one of your past posts appeared, regardless of whether you advertised the connection between his identity and your avatar only once or did it a thousand times.<br /><br />Granted it does seem like you were trying to act in the best interests of the SR community in your own way, but tearing someone&#039;s anonymity to shreds certainly isn&#039;t the way to protect a community which holds anonymity in the highest regard.<br /><br />How long have you been a member here, gestaltassault2? Your previous account, I mean.

				Yeah I thought that thread was out of order. Yes the guy was asking a stupid question but he started out being polite and friendly. It was only when people started taking the piss out of him ( his spelling etc. which by the way was fine) that he got defensive. Y&#039;all came across as a bunch of smug cliquey motherfuckers yo.<br />Posting his picture just struck me as against the principles of the community. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not saying the guy wasn&#039;t a dickhead. But you could have PM&#039;d him and told him his arse was showing.

				So what happened to the member who&#039;s identity was revealed?<br />He has to be pretty pretty stupid like dude was saying to use the same handle on here as he does for his everyday things like facebook.<br /><br />SR is the ONLY place I use Hope2come and if it were ever searched you won&#039;t find anything even related to anything I would ever even consider thinking about...<br /><br />I mean he should be banned too, right? If a member could so easily be found out LE could just as easily to a google search and link it to his YouTube then to FB...<br /><br />After getting caught its only 1 step shy of working with LE to try and bring down SR or its vendors.. They could have him continue to try and meet ppl on SR and then bust them or have him order from vendors in the USA and figure out what city they are shipping from and then do some detective work and ask the PO about people who send a lot of the same package and then start busting vendors..<br /><br />Something definitely needed to be done, Revealing his identity may not have been the best call, but I understand that it was a HUUUGE security risk. And SOMETHING should have been done..

We&#039;ll get along famously on our sexual murder spree! (Or murderous sex spree, either or!)<br /><br />3) I do still take issue with though.<br />I&#039;m certainly not basing my statements on anything that I&#039;ve read here; I don&#039;t trust anything I read here until I back it up with my own research on the subject, and I would advise everybody here to operate with the same mindset. I&#039;m basing my statements on my own experience and research of the methods I use, including their potential vulnerabilities, before I use them.<br /><br />You&#039;re more than right, we are certainly not invulnerable here! There is definitely a lot of &#039;low hanging fruit&#039; here that could be picked off with ease. However, I take my security very seriously, and many others do the same.<br />I said it is &#039;nigh on impossible&#039; to find someone when they&#039;re following proper security procedures. Nothing is impossible. Many things are implausible, but nothing is impossible. &quot;Nigh on impossible&quot; literally means &quot;near impossible&quot;, not &quot;impossible&quot; in an absolute sense.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a betting man, but if I were you would be getting your dollar - there is always going to be some people who attack problems in new and innovative ways. Indeed that is what drives advances in technology and science.<br />Were I to ask the question you posed of people with far more knowledge than I on the subject then I would certainly hear some techniques I&#039;ve never heard of, but given that I don&#039;t just utilise my own security procedures, I research the procedures others are using and work them into my security setup if they are sound, I&#039;m very well hidden from any who would wish to uncover my identity.<br /><br />The only potential security flaw that is a real threat to my security at the moment is 3 different vendors who have received my personal information for a very low single digit number of purchases of prescription drugs, and one legal product. If they&#039;re following the rules, then that personal information is gone. There is of course every chance that they&#039;re not following the rules, though I&#039;m not worried about being unmasked for such small orders.<br /><br />I suppose in conclusion the only thing to state is that we are all only as secure as we make ourselves. Many implement &#039;security blanket&#039; security procedures which make them FEEL safe, but in reality do absolutely nothing to protect them. I like to count myself among those who take my security a lot more seriously than that by constantly reading up on new techniques, new potential vulnerabilities with the programs and techniques I am using and implementing what works for others after researching the method thoroughly myself.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a paranoid person by nature, but just because I&#039;m not paranoid doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not out to get me.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I didn&#039;t know that.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a great hockey fan, but I&#039;ll always support the Habs. I&#039;m old enough to remember the &quot;glory years&quot; when it was said that, &quot;The Stanley Cup parade will take its traditional route though the city.&quot;&nbsp; The only year that stands out was Centennial Year, when the Toronto Maple Laughs won the Stanley Cup.&nbsp; I remember being really disappointed that Les Canadiens didn&#039;t win it that year, but I suppose that we had Expo67, and all that. <br /><br />One of my brothers-in-law is a die-hard Maple Leafs fan, and I never tire of teasing him about how he supports such perpetual losers.&nbsp; It&#039;s 45 years this year, since the Leafs last won the Stanley Cup. That was at the start of my brother-in-law&#039;s working life... he&#039;s retired now, just turned 65. There is little doubt in my mind that we&#039;ll both be dead of natural causes before either of us sees another Stanley Cup win by the Leafs. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />LOL.. at least he never gave up hope your bro-in-law.. thats some determination if you ask me... I just dont understand how you can root for a team that has not won a Stanley Cup since 67.... I&#039;ll tell you something... its because of people like your bro in&nbsp; law and I that hockey rocks!!!!!&nbsp; without us diehards it would just be another game!<br /><br />I love going to the mtl VS tor games.. its my favorite match-up..well second... bruins are number one!<br /><br />
