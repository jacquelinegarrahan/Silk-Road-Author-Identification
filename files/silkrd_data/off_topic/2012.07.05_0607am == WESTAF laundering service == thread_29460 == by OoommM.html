				<br /><br />To all SR users, I know that this letter will be a surprising one to you. Firstly, I will like to introduce myself formally as Mr.Sanusi Lamido, The Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). You are been officially contacted by me today because your Inheritance Funds were Re-deposited into the \&quot;Federal Suspense Account\&quot; of CBN last week, because you did not forward your Claim as the Right beneficiary. Well known to all. The Central Bank of Nigeria is the mother Bank of all commercial Banks here in Nigeria. Really these men were unexpected by me because their visit was impromptu. I had to ask them why they came to see me in person and they said that they were here to collect the Inheritance Bill Sum of (US$9.7Million) which rightfully belongs to you, on your behalf. At this development I asked them who authorized them to come down to Nigeria for the Collection of this Payment and they told me that you asked them to come and collect this Funds on your Behalf.<br />&nbsp;They actually tendered some Vital Documents which proved that you actually sent them for the Collection of these Funds. Honestly, it really baffles me that you took such decision without my consent. Here is the Document which they tendered to this Bank today:<br /><br />&nbsp;1. LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION.<br />&nbsp;2. HIGH COURT INJUCTION.<br />&nbsp;3. ORDER TO RELEASE.<br /><br />&nbsp;Actually, these Documents which they tendered to this Noble Bank are a clear Proof that you sent them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally, I told them to come back tomorrow morning and they promised to come back. As the Governor of this Noble Bank, I was supposed to Release this Funds to them but I refused to do so because I wanted to hear from you first. Due to the Nature of my job, I will not want to make any mistake in Releasing this Funds to anyone except you whom is the Recognized Beneficiary to this Funds. Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make this Payment to these foreigners whom came on your behalf.<br /><br />&nbsp;OFFICIALLY SIGNED.<br />ZERO EFFECT<br />&nbsp;GOVERNOR, CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA
