				I&#039;ll be brief. I have developed a benzo dependency in a very short term. I use to party all day and all night it seemed when i was in my twenties! Benzos i take for legitimate reasons. Some prescribed, the rest off of SR. I can&#039;t seem to find a working system for tapering off of the benzos gradually. I&#039;ve tried and been forced to go cold turkey a few times and i say that is not an option! Klonopins don&#039;t do shit for me and ativan&#039;s are the same, but a little bit better than the k-pins. I need to find a way to taper off that works for me. I&#039;m moving to a new part of the country working on an oil-rig and don&#039;t want to be loaded while working up in the derricks, but don&#039;t wanna be sick from wd&#039;s either. It&#039;s tough physical work. <br /><br />Anyway, my original plan was to taper off of the benzos completely before i went back to work, but that shit ain&#039;t gonna happen. I&#039;ve had the body aches and chills for the last 24 hours and during this time i&#039;ve taken a total of 5mg&#039;s of ativan and 2mg&#039;s of xanax. I&#039;ve got the BAD chill&#039;s. WTF?! Just what i&#039;ve taken in the last 24 hours should at least prevent me from having withdrawals i would think. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a virus, because i&#039;ve gone through opiate withdrawals in the past many times&nbsp; times and can tell the difference between a flu bug and wd&#039;s. The only thing i can come up with is that my tolerance&nbsp; has gotten so high that 2mgs and 5 mgs of ativan isn&#039;t enough to keep wd&#039;s at bay. If that&#039;s the case, then i&#039;m fucked. o i need to get more xanax and start at a high daily dose, then taper down to say 2mgs a day before i switch over to ativan or valium?
