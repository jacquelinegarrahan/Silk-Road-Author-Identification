				Just wondering how many of the SR vendors actually use their own product&#039;s regularly? Like do you use just 1 or 2 specific items or do you use everything you sell? Or do you use nothing at all???<br />It&#039;s never a good thing to get high on your own supply, especially if it&#039;s coke or an opiate! ha ha You might run out and not be able to fill orders...<br /><br />All feedback welcome! :)

				I use my weed when I am stressed out only. Weed isn&#039;t really my drug of choice. Shrooms on the other hand :D YES<br /><br />Each batch I make my own personal stash, apart from the stuff I sell. Its so I always know the amount I have to sell and the amount I can play with :)

				I don&#039;t sell meth for that very reason. I would be completely unreliable unless everyone finalized early so I could have the money to pay my dealer, because I could not spend my own money on meth and then not use it. I have been sending small amounts of meth to a few people I know well, and they could tell you it takes fucking forever before I actually get their package shipped, lol.. I hate it, I love nothing more than making people happy, but I literally just cannot send my last bit of meth to someone..

				I don&#039;t use any of my products any more.<br /><br />Once upon a time, I used to smoke and occassionally do my cyans, a long ways back, but I haven&#039;t touched anything in 5 or more years.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use &quot;focus groups&quot; to test my latest strains (which I usually have in stock for a while so it&#039;s not like I&#039;m doing it every 3 days).&nbsp; Veterans with far more experience and tolerance than I have who give me good honest opinions on my options.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite fun and because it&#039;s a decent group of people it takes a lot of the subjectivity out of picking the best bang for my buck as opposed to just trying stuff myself.<br /><br />It&#039;s all business these days.&nbsp; Which in the end is probably better for my customers anyway.

				I never get high on my own supply, but that&#039;s just because if I liked what I have to offer it would never be listed! :D

				As someone who only sells Adderall and dexedrine, i&#039;ve never had the need to test my product for quality.&nbsp; I have taken a few adderall over the time ive been selling, but then it throws off the number i have to sell (i like to sell in lots of 10)
