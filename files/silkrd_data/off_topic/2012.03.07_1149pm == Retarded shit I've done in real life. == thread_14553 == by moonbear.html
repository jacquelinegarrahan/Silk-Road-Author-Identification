				Once when I was 14. I walked into mcdonalds high and walked up to a black guy working inside. He said can I take your order? I tried to order but was too high. He said are you okay? Soon this got the attention of other employees. No one else was there because it was around midnight. I finally said, &quot;I&#039;ll take a mcdouble nigga&quot;. I thought I sounded cool. He jumped over the counter and put me in a choke hold. I couldn&#039;t breathe and soon the other employees grabbed him off of me. We all agreed not to get LEO involved. I ate a bunch of food and fell asleep in the corner. When closing came they literally kicked me out because I was too messed up to leave myself. I stumbled over to a park and slept on the grass, then told my mom I stayed the nigt at a friends house.<br /><br />I was once in juvi and they would take the shackles off you after court by having you go on your knees in a chair while they crouched down and unlocked them. I blasted a warm, smelly, sightly wet fart into the gaurds face. I was lucky enough to have the biggest asshole gaurd unlock my shackles. He was pissed and stuck me in isolation for a day. I hated him because he made fun of a smaller kid who cried for his mom. Even the other kids left him alone because he was just too young for juvi. They had to drag him out of the visiting room once when his mom came to visit and he wouldn&#039;t leave. The gaurd was always like, &quot;Gonna cry?&quot; and sometimes he made the kid go up in tears. It was totally worth farting in his face. <br /><br />Another time in juvi someone pooped on the floor. To this day I don&#039;t know how it got there. The gaurds cleaned it up and a couple kids thought I did it. They started making fun of me and I said fuck you. Then they beat me up.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				How much disk space does a thread like this use? Maybe 500 bytes per post, then 20 to 50 posts before people move on. 10k to 25k bytes average is my guess. So (check my math) a 1TB disk could store from 40 to 100 million threads like &#039;Retarded shit I&#039;ve done in real life&#039;. <br /><br />My question is, why are these threads censored, blocked, harassed or tampered with in any way? In a community of liberals, anarchists and pirates how does that make sense? If it isn&#039;t mislabeled why interfere with artistic exploration, humor, banter, whimsy, play and fun? This bully-boy moderator behavior seems to parallel the state oppression that SR claims to be resisting. <br /><br />How ironic.

(How can you have any pudding if you don&#039;t eat your meat!) The first to be dealt with are the trolls. (Are there any queers in the audience tonight? Get &#039;em up against the wall!) Next will be the commies. (That one in the spotlight, he don&#039;t look right! Get him up against the wall!) Then of course all of those damned Nordic types. (And that one looks Jewish... and that one&#039;s a coon! Who let all this riff raff into the room?) The final solution in my plan for a perfect community will be to get rid of all of those stinking junkies. (That one&#039;s smoking a joint! And that one&#039;s got spots! If I had my way, I&#039;d have all of you shot!)<br /><br />So vote for me as the new moderator :)

Maybe 500 bytes per post, then 20 to 50 posts before people move on. 10k to 25k bytes average is my guess.

In a community of liberals, anarchists and pirates how does that make sense? If it isn&#039;t mislabeled why interfere with artistic exploration, humor, banter, whimsy, play and fun?

Maybe 500 bytes per post, then 20 to 50 posts before people move on. 10k to 25k bytes average is my guess. So (check my math) a 1TB disk could store from 40 to 100 million threads like &#039;Retarded shit I&#039;ve done in real life&#039;. <br /><br />My question is, why are these threads censored, blocked, harassed or tampered with in any way? In a community of liberals, anarchists and pirates how does that make sense? If it isn&#039;t mislabeled why interfere with artistic exploration, humor, banter, whimsy, play and fun? This bully-boy moderator behavior seems to parallel the state oppression that SR claims to be resisting. <br /><br />How ironic.&nbsp; &nbsp; This +1<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
