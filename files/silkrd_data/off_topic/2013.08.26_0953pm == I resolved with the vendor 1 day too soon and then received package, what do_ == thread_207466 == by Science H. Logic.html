				Title pretty much sums it up. I ordered from T5 over a month ago and we agreed over the weekend to reship 1 part of my order and refund the other part. I intend to send him back the refund (unrefund? rerefund?) since he did provide me with the product (albeit very delayed). <br /><br />But what do I do about the reship? It would be nice if I had a swimming pool full of bitcoins that I could just double my payment every time a vendor sends me double the product. <br /><br />I feel bad about giving him 0 though, unless he assures me it&#039;s okay then he will probably have my repeat business anyway. I think the profit margin on these materials is probably pretty high for him. Maybe 50/50? <br /><br />What do you guys think?<br />

				Hey,<br /><br />Although a month is long time, itt obviously was not either of your fault for that.&nbsp; I think sending the vendor back what he refunded you is fair since you didn&#039;t do it on purpose and he isn&#039;t expecting any more money at all from you.&nbsp; Should make him happy about your honesty and will probably be good to you with future orders.<br /><br />Thanks for the honesty a +1 for you mate.<br /><br />Libby<br />

				Thanks bro. Just trying to live by the golden rule. With that in mind I don&#039;t feel bad about sending him back the refund and calling it a day (with a tab in my mouth).&nbsp; 8)
