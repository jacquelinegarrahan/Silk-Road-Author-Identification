				ok I am either the dumbest person in the room, or the smartest.<br /><br />Satoshi= Super<br />&nbsp;Naka =inner<br />Moto=Motivation.<br /><br />Personally I think it means &quot;Super Mario&quot;&nbsp; AKA Shigeru Miyamoto&nbsp; Inventor of Super Mario and Excite Bike a Moto-cross game.<br /><br />Mario Gets Coin, Mario takes a chance on a package (? block), Mario gets some leaf and goes High, Mario gets a mushroom and gets Big,&nbsp; Mario gets a flower and throws FIRE, Mario gets a star and has a invincibly good colorful time.<br /><br />It&#039;s either an inside joke everyone knows and I&#039;m just catching, or i am revealing to those who haven&#039;t gotten it.&nbsp; Am I ahead of the curve, on the curve or behind the curve?<br /><br />Please enlighten me.

				Satoshi was most likely a team of people, at least 2. The writer/talker, possibly also the conceptual designer (this could be 1 or 2 people), plus 1-3 people on a coding team. I favor the &quot;R.A. Hettinga&quot; hypothesis myself.. with him having a couple of guys working the code/development side.&nbsp; All speculation of course.. whatever his actual name.. his pseudonym will go down in history.<br /><br />Even if Hettinga WASN&#039;T Satoshi his intellectual work prefigured and informed whoever actually invented/wrote the BTC code.<br /><br />Check this out..&nbsp; http://www.systemics.com/legal/digigold/discovery/postings/Geoecon.pdf&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;Geodesic economics, bearer digital cryptocurrency etc. ... and Hettinga was writing about this stuff in his newletters and WIRED articles in the late 90s.<br /><br />&nbsp;It&#039;s stuff like this that makes me think vendors should try NOT to cash out, but hold onto their bitcoins as a retirement fund. Chances are.. 40 years from now they will curse themselves for taking paper money for their Bitcoins which would (at that future point) make them very wealthy indeed.

				I&#039;m not suggesting Hettinga was numero uno in conception, by his own admission he was mainly a idea conglomerator. But his take is fascinating. <br /><br />BTW Changed the link above, copied in the wrong one.
