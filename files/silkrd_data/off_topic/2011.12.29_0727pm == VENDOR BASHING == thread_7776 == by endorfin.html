				Please consider that all this vendor bashing may just be some LE trying to disrupt the trade. Free text comments in the Forum could be from anyone. Many SR buyers do not use the same handle on the Forum as they do on SR and many Forum contributors may not even have an SR account. It would be very easy for me to add to an existing thread and influence others.<br /><br />One solution might be;<br />Responses concerning; shipping time, packaging, product quality, vendor communication, compensation etc. should be standardized in SR as a drop down list. SR should remove the free text box from the finalizing page. <br /><br />With respect to vendor performance, there are only a finite number of responses one can make concerning a transaction. I got the shit in x business days, the packaging was from 1 to 5, the quality was from 1 to5, communication was 1 to 5, an so on.<br /><br />So:<br />When a customer selects less than 5 on finalizing SR should pop a dialog saying; <br /><br />&quot;Your score selection is used to rate this vendor. If you were not satisfied in some way with this transaction, please message your vendor first. Give the vendor an opportunity to make good with you before influencing his overall reputation.&quot;<br /><br />Leave all free text commentary to the Forum and take it with a grain of salt, or your favorite drug.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I found the current implementation of SR feedback just fine. No need for eBay style feedback, where 4 out of 5 stars = ban.<br /><br />LE most likely will not to disrupt sales posing as a buyers. They better get off posing as vendors and busting buyers. Few high profile cases and the chaos and paranoia will follow.<br /><br />If Seller deserves 4 out of 5 stars, he will get them! My scores:<br />1 of 5 = seller take my money but never sent package or in package was baking powder and dried dog shit.<br />2 of 5 = package was sent, but lost due to gross neglect of seller - wrong receiving address or hash oil leaked out of bottle or envelope. No refund given or out of escrow transaction.<br />3 of 5 = Sames as above but partial refund received.<br />4 of 5 = Product not as advertised, such as product described as pure fishscale coke but it was mixed with additives, pills does not contain even half of indicated ingredients or ingredients that have adverse effects. Unpotent ganja such as 3% THC when advertised as containing 15+ THC and so on.<br />5 of 5 = Everything as advertised, package arrived prompt and safely.

				lol these forums are some of the coolest i&#039;ve ever been on in terms of community respect but one thing that really pisses me off is when everyone goes &quot;LE! / LEO! / fucking pigs / narcs!&quot;<br /><br />guys...LEO doesn&#039;t give a FUCK about vendor bashing and disrupting the drug trade by posting false feedback..do you REALLY THINK they are going to waste precious man hours TROLLING these boards and trying to stop a TINY sale or two this way?<br /><br />I DONT THINK SO.<br /><br />they go after the BIG FISH...people shipping out KILOS and even then it&#039;s substances like coke &amp; heroin that put sites like SR on the priority list and that&#039;s if it&#039;s done openly too. Interesting post I read on here today where somebody said the heroin dealers on SR are &quot;part-time&quot; and it&#039;s true there&#039;s not really a constant supply of this or pure coke...if you read any of the coke threads on here you&#039;ll get a lot of people disputing the quality of coke sold on these boards...<br /><br />there has YET to be a seller offering large quantities of class a&#039;s/schedule 1&#039;s and until that happens SR will still be low priority despite all the shout-outs SR has from magazines, politicians e.t.c<br /><br />by all means secure your systems, use PGP keys, use your common sense but lets stop all this bullshit...
