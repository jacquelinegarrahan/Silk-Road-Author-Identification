				Here beith the deal!<br /><br />This guy I&#039;ve known for a long ass time turned into a piece of shit scum bag and is trying everything in his right mind to take me down, even going to the local PD and making up stories about me and shit..Even hired a private investigator and I was followed in my car 2 weeks ago.<br /><br />If this douche bag say&#039;s some shit to the police about he knows someone who buys off a Black Market online, all I got to do is not admit shit right and I should be good?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Clean house, clean phone, clean car.<br /><br />They can&#039;t just barge up in there without evidence. What type of stuff are buying, like personal or mass amounts. And personal being 1/4 ounces of pot, or grams of mdma and mas being ounces, lbs/s etc

				It seems to me that if this guy is willing to lie to the police, then they&#039;ll be able to get a warrant.&nbsp; How much more can it take than a civilian randomly reporting &quot;he&#039;s got POUNDS of it in there!&quot;&nbsp; Seems like a judge is gonna authorize it awfully quick.&nbsp; Just think: how would you fuck yourself over if you really wanted to and were willing to lie?<br /><br />Figured it out?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Now defend against it :)

				If all you&#039;ve got is a couple bongs at your house, don&#039;t sweat it, but also don&#039;t bring anything in that&#039;ll screw you over until you find out what&#039;s going on; If the PD decides to storm and search, and not find anything, it will just further discredit your asshole adversary. Just let your pad &quot;cool down&quot; for a little while.<br /><br />Best of luck to ya man
