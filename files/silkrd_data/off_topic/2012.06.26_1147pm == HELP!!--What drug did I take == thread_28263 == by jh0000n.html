				Contrary to the title this isnt urgent but a while ago I got a sample of what was supposed to be K from an online vendor (not SR). having never done K back then I didnt know what to expect..the stuff was very fine small transparent crystals (like glass) and when I snorted a very small line it made my throat very minty and numb. Then almost instantly my body got so heavy I couldnt hold my head up and I blacked out for a split second and couldnt see anything. It was almost like a rush so to speak from every little line...my body feeling was&nbsp; that of a large dose of K like when your so heavy it feels like your falling. After doing about 6 lines I also felt very happy..I dunno it isnt like any K ive done since then and honestly I liked it more than any K after it. The only thing is im not sure it was K at all...maybe it was mxe? i dunno if this sounds familiar to anyone please let me know id love to get more of whatever that was!

				If you were taking mxe with K doses that would be terrifying so probably not that but that all depends on how big your lines were.<br />If you had over 150/170mg then I think it&#039;s highly unlikely it was mxe as that would of sent you a lot more crazy than that

Ive never done s-isomer K only the reg stuff if you say it gets your throat minty maybe thats what i got back then because reg K dosent do that. Also does mxe make your throat numb/minty?

				I hardly even noticed MXE on my throat at all. I think it&#039;s easy to snort. Mild bad taste but easy compared to most. 100% not minty
