				I&#039;m facing at least 6 to 7 years in prison in USA.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to decide to stay and do the time or leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no ties or family, so no issues there.&nbsp; I have means of making money temporarily until i permanently leave the country.&nbsp; &nbsp;Out on bond now, so I&#039;ve gotta decide what to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;Advice?&nbsp; &nbsp;No passport, so I&#039;d need a fake one once I finally get ready to leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Do you have bug out cash?&nbsp; Then, if you did run, how eager would they be to try and find you?&nbsp; Would they go to the trouble of putting it on TV and all that?&nbsp; Fake documents are fairly easy to aquire, but staying a ghost long term takes some skill.&nbsp; There is more than one way, can&#039;t say here.

				Absolutely flee to Mexico / South America if you have the means to get by.&nbsp; I personally would rather walk there by foot from Maine than take 6-7 in prison.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have the means to get by or any life plan, then take the sentence.&nbsp; Really boils down to how much liquidity you have, your skill set, worldliness etc.

				The general advice if you&#039;re thinking about fleeing is... don&#039;t. You have to break all contact with absolutely everyone in your life and you can&#039;t see them again, ever. As in EVER, not even funerals or anything. You have to spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, never fully trusting anyone and being ready to flee at any given moment. Which means you&#039;ll never have &quot;real&quot; friends again... because even going for a few beers and some lines of coke and a few spliffs at a new buddy&#039;s is risky because you could accidentally &#039;fess up you&#039;re on the run then they talk to someone else and... next thing you know you&#039;re in prison and doing way more time than you would have done in the first place. <br /><br />It sounds like a horrible existence being on the run, more so than doing the time in some cases. Do the time if at all possible. <br /><br />But IF you&#039;re serious there&#039;s some great advice in this thread. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182109.0<br /><br />What Madseason says is the best advice of all. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182109.msg1334613#msg1334613<br /><br />NickNack also has a good viewpoint http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182109.msg1336380#msg1336380<br /><br />and again Madseason on fake IDs http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182109.msg1344584#msg1344584<br /><br />Think very long and very hard before you flee and good luck.<br /><br />

				If you are a rich fuck and have all the finance you need, but are facing a decade or more behind bars, then fleeing is the best way to go. <br />If not then it may not be worth the trouble. <br /><br />Then again, starting a new life in tropical paradise from scratch is always appealing...

				May I ask, what was the sentance for? How eager would they be to chase you to whatever country you flee to?<br /><br />If you have the means to, then do it! I&#039;d much rather spend my life on the run than spend 6 years in prison, but that&#039;s me.<br />Locker.

				Cutting all ties is no issue, as I could care less to see any one again.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe have 5k bug out cash to get away, and then make money from there to leave permanently.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I&#039;ve searched the forums and seen most of the above mentioned threads.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t like the idea of running either, but 6 years is a lot.&nbsp;

				5k bug out cash will get you away to somewhere, but once your there, that is the question.&nbsp; Unless you know someone or start small and hustle up some money dealing where you end up.&nbsp; It can be done, just alot of bullshit to go thru

What kinda time woulfd you do? Fed? State?&nbsp; These are things to consider .&nbsp; 6 years seems long, but, especially the older you get, 6 years is shit in life terms. Look back at the last 6 years, 2007 was yesterday to me and a lot of folks I know are in the same places they were 6 ears ago. Not geographically. but the same places in their lives, same job, girl, living conditions, etc, etc.
