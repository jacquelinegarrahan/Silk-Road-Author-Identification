				I wish all you miserable half lifes would stop making threads about leaving and STFU &amp; GTFO!<br />If you think some world police is looking for you and that is gonna bring some marvelous glory, well that shit will never happen. <br />You whining sore twats obviously don&#039;t even understand the concept behind Silk Road in the first place.<br />Although 90% of the people here think SR is just a cleverly hidden drug market, it&#039;s more than that in the origin and in the big picture. Sure I buy drugs here, drugs I would never be able to experience where I live and I think that&#039;s true for 50% of the community but there&#039;s more here.<br />The Origin of Silk Road is about Freedom and Community. There is so much potential here being squandered by numb skulls that it&#039;s created a china blind effect. Silk Road could be just the tip of the iceberg that one day spawns a place on this planet where some fuckwad commie govcod tries to tell me what I can and can&#039;t do while I&#039;m alive on this planet and I can simply tell him to &quot;FUCK OFF BABY CUNT, I LIVE IN A FREE WORLD&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=dbb0c5884df415889f9730d152b36095.jpg

				Ummm guys I think I might have inspired Scampony into this making this thread.<br />She had a personal issue with a vendor and i helped her out and told her doing things like for people like her was really the only reason I&#039;ve stayed a moderator here at Silk Road. It certainly isnt for the popularity or a target on my back. I&#039;m a volunteer so it wasnt for money. I&#039;m really only here to try to help those I can not make a mistake that actually ruins their life from ignorance.<br /><br />IDK or maybe I&#039;m reading to much into this. She is right though and I agree with what forgotmypassword said as well. Sorry if that doesn&#039;t gel with some of you.<br /><br />You guys see those negative karmas I have by my username....every one is from someone who didn&#039;t want to hear the truth I was trying to tell them. <br /><br />For the knuckleheads posting Tits or GTFO, grow up.

				I think people are just on-edge lately. With the increased media coverage and there being a huge influx of new users, nobody really knows what to expect. It&#039;s impossible to say whether the increased publicity is going to be a good thing or not. <br /><br />The best thing to do is just chill the fuck out and continue as normal. At the end of the day, top quality drugs are still for sale here with unmatched convenience. If you don&#039;t like certain people on here, just ignore them. There&#039;s no need to get in a twist over people on an internet forum. <br /><br />Complaining about negativity is just creating more negativity. It&#039;s feeding the trolls. I can honestly say I didn&#039;t even notice all of these supposed bad vibes until people started making threads about it. A cacophony of people talking about how things &quot;aren&#039;t the same anymore&quot; and diminishing everyone elses faith in our system does more damage to this community than any single scamming asshole ever could.
