				Mine was during the first wave of MtGix spam. My account was somehow wrongfully suspended and I started an angry thread about it. One of the mods (can&#039;t remember which one) gave me 2 BTC, to &quot;make up for it&quot; kinda. I waited a few days to profit from the steep value gain back then and sold the coins for â‚¬17.2, which I donated to the German Hemp Association.

				&nbsp;ADDICTED TO SNIFFING PANTIES.<br />Â« on: July 04, 2013, 02:33 pm Â»<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote Courtesy Northern Star<br /><br />&quot;Can someone help me I have a problem, I can&#039;t stop smelling sexy panties, not like handbrake marks or even pissy pairs&nbsp; just 1 day old beautiful panties.<br />It started when me and my fiancee moved to a student shared house. The 2 girls in top flat, are proper cockteasers, like getting fucked and moaning so loud, well I stumbled into the bathroom one afternoon, and couldn&#039;t help noticing the washing basket was full, but on top was a pair of sexy pink silk panties. I immediately grabbed them and stuffed the down my pants, I quickly retreated to my bedroom for a proper inspection, They were so fucking sexy, with a stunning smell of pussy, this Charlotte is so fresh, she&#039;s a fresh fox, anyway I started wanking furiously and soon had them on my head,, the crotch part was damp with pussy juice and cum, it was such a turn on, Imagining her pussy inside them I soon exploded all over the crotch bit. Then I was ashamed, I put them back and hoped she wouldn&#039;t notice there was a pantie theif on the loose, we ll its now become a routine and \i can&#039;t stop, everyday I&#039;m fishing through looking for lotty&#039;s panties. Sometimes she leaves a thong, Oh it&#039;s so addictive help am I ill?&quot;<br />

				I had a good experience with a vendor that made me feel pretty solid. <br /><br />I placed an order, it got sent and I got the tracking info. Takes 2-3 days, so nothing to do but wait, and finalize when it shows up. (And get high)<br /><br />Next day, there&#039;s a message from the vendor that a mistake was made, they sent me the wrong parcel, but not to worry. He&#039;ll send out the proper order immediately. Sends me a drop address with PGP, so I can send the mistake parcel back. Made me realize that the guy obviously trusts me, since I ended up with both parcels, plus a few btc for shipping. <br /><br />At this point, I could just walk away from the deal with my stuff, extra stuff, and some cash. Never, ever, ever had a real life dealer treat anyone this decently, or show so much trust in me.<br /><br />And this has happened twice, with different vendors, though not exactly the same the 2nd time, but basically. Got sent way too much by mistake, which I could have denied, or walked away, but I sent extra funds to cover the cost and square up.<br /><br />Feels good to deal with honest people!

How have you been? When did we implement avatars? Yours seems familiar.<br /><br /><br />My best moment would definitely be finding my current boss. BudCentral will never ask anyone to finalize early, and this is why I work for him. The Silk Road has mechanisms to deal with issues, among them is the Resolution Center, which I have been using since my first purchase on the silk road.<br /><br />Now, I&#039;m still hard up for money, but at least I&#039;m high and smiling while broke.

Set the bar high for me when i got here. I remember when SR was down for a few days, i remember when it the 3rd or 4th day hit, I was thinking I just might have to start going to more events and talking to douchebags again trying to get into the local scene. <br />But DPR is the man and does what he does. <br /><br />As far as know you could use an avatar when i first made my account, which was like a year an a half ago. Once I get to around 400 posts though I make a new forum account. Don&#039;t want people collecting shit I say, not that I say anything incriminating, but if I had a single account for the whole time I was here, it might not be too hard to track someone

				Fav moment was the billybigbuds debacle around about a year ago. Would&#039;be referred to it as a fiasco if BBB hadn&#039;t turned it around and rescued his rep and account and appears to have created a solid customer base. <br /><br />For those who dunno what I&#039;m on about, BBB was testing the water for apretty impressive range of green and selected 10-12 samplers (myself included) who all received minimum 2 strains, usual 4, with 1 lucky muthafucka getting an oz worth of strains to review. <br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp; the delays on these eventually going out and subsequently being received had everyone wondering if this was maybe an attempt to dox SR regulars. What didn&#039;t help BBB&#039;s cause were the rambling lengthy posts that appeared about 4-5am, went off on a tangent and finished up concluding something totally different, and only seemed to further convince buyers that BBB was hammering coke while trying to run a weed service. <br /><br />So... once all samples were received and the first coupla rounds of paid for orders went the same way, more and more increasingly paranoid forum members were posting in&nbsp; single use forum accounts that they had been approached by Dispatches journalists doing a story on SR and were quite clearly freaking the fuck out. Meanwhile BBB, trying to stick to his rambling guns was obviously trying to hone his client base to a manageable number, and using the full 17 days for domestic deliveries, and appeared to only be sending when buyer took order to the Resolution Centre. Needless to say this pissed more than a few cunts off who&#039;re used to waiting 3 days max for UK domestic orders. <br /><br />There also seemed to be a suggestion that BBB comprised a few posties who may or may not have intercepted or rescued prospective orders going out which&nbsp; would not have made it ordinarily due to stealth or other issues, but this was never fully clarified, adding to more folks donning their respective tinfoil hats. <br /><br />Then BBB got his account suspended despite not ripping a single buyer off, but from what appears to have been an inability to manage demand and PGP. <br /><br />It&#039;s all been well sorted and having just checked BBB is back in the 98+% bracket. But that was a serious clusterfuck and baptism of fire into vending but way better than any soap opera. Kept me coming back to his thread daily.&nbsp; Definite lulz without the usual prank intent.

				Yeah I liked him as well. I got an 8ball and an oz of his paper thin weed with no problems from customs. I was sad to see him go. Although it seemed there were a lot of very shady things going down with peoples packages going missing and with what looked like fake feedback. I never had any problems though and I loved the coke.
