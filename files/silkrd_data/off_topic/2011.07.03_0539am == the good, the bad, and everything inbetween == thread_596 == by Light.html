				So I figured there are some people on these forums with a broad range of drug experiences, the tales of which could be very entertaining to read, not to mention offer some valuable information to those seeking to explore those particular drugs.<br /><br />For those that are interested, post a list of drugs you&#039;ve tried, along with whatever details you feel pertinent... like how many times, and how you&#039;d rate it. Here&#039;s my list:<br />Marijuana, appr 30 times, never really been a fan<br />Salvia, 3 times: cool shit, weird out of body experiences, though intensely uncomfortable<br />LSA (no not LSD): 2 times, mild experiences, not worth the nauseau<br />Mescaline, 3 times: Incredibly energetic psychedelic, brewed a tea from San Pedro and drinking it ruined the experience<br />Mushrooms, 4 times: Fuck yeah mushrooms. Taken up to 5.2g. They&#039;re notoriously difficult to handle, but nothing compares.<br />MDMA, maybe 15 times now: Cured my depression, nearly saved my life. Pure MDMA is incredible, the peak of which is a moment of inexplicable, euphoric epiphany. Definitely something everyone should try.<br />Methamphetamine, 1 time: HOLY FUCK<br />Oxycontin, 3 times: just made me itchy and lethargic<br />Ketamine, 1 time: weird, dreamy, trippy, euphoric. overall fun. I&#039;d like to hear what others have experienced with K. Any input?<br />DMT, probably 30 or 40 times: this is the true universe. The DMT breakthrough experience will unveil the truth of reality, that there is an underlying current not visible to the sober mind, and the cosmos is ours to explore. 10/10 you must experience it to understand<br />2C-I, 12 times: doses have ranged from 10mg orally to 30mg insufflated, this is one of my favorites. Lucid, beautiful visuals, euphoric and peaceful. <br />2C-E, 15 times: same dose range as 2c-i, but different experiences. Can be more difficult during the come up, but 2C-E is pure musical heaven. I&#039;ve rediscovered music because of it, even had multiple ego deaths from snorted doses. You can get lost in a song with 2c-e, amazing stuff.<br />2C-D, 5 times: tried 3 nootropic doses, but tolerance develops too quickly. Psychedelic doses are extremely light... eh, not a fan.<br />4-AcO-DMT, 4 times: THE BEST DRUG EVER. Like a superior, cleaner mushroom trip. Beautiful, intense visuals, especially when paired with a MAOI. <br />Desoxypipadrol, 6 times: most powerful stimulant in history, will keep you awake for 36 hours. Be careful, this shit can kill you at 10mg but be perfect at 7mg...<br />5-MeO-Mipt, 10 times: Fuck yeah, Moxy. Like the tryptamine version of MDMA, its euphoric, tactile, and gets visual i the end.<br />GHB, twice: Like being drunk, but without any of the negatives. Fun as fuck.<br /><br />let&#039;s see what you&#039;ve got.&nbsp; ;D I&#039;m interested in hearing about some real LSD stories, plus other RCs.

				I don&#039;t feel like listing all the drugs ive taken, but I will say that Ibogaine was the craziest i lied in bed alone for 3.5 days no food no water. Projectile vomit, shat myself, hallucinations were unlike any other drug ive ever tried.<br /><br />I had psychic sex with a reindeer, I was a mexican mafia member pawning gold for black tar H. I was in portland trying to cop and never could also I tried to trade yeyo for h but no one would I also could never find cleans. I was a cuban gangsta doing yeyo in casinos and drinking scotch. I was in the tv show dexter and there was a jap dexter and everyone was covering up for dexter. apparently every 10000 years another dexter is born. I also was a king and my brother tryed to usurp the throne from me. fucked up shit. Anyone put any significance to this?<br />also dreamed about hunter s thompsons attorney oding on mescaline in the desert. <br /><br />Wierdest experience of my life

				light - I always wanted but was afraid of psychedelics (I fear those who live inside me:). What is the most mild psychedelic you suggest to try for a psy-virgin? Would be best if the trip could be interrupted if needed. The other thing that scares me off is a 8-10 hour trip. The other thing.. I&#039;m not very fond of nature - I know, that best to go tripping somewhere in nature, but I&#039;m not a fan:).. After your post i read about 2C-E. That sounds interesting. But is it not to powerful for a &#039;virgin&#039;?<br /><br />on topic:<br /><br />Speed (amphetamine) tried~4x : Strange surge of energy - you can do endlessly whatever you are doing - talk to strangers about most intimate things, dance, shine shoes, anything... aaaaand no sleep for you mate for next 24 hours. Lying in bed sweating like a pig, strange depression-like felling the next day. in general - not worth it<br />Mephedrone ~6 times: Nice sobering effect, chatty, energetic. Once went to take a dump, somehow took my mp3player - some nice whole body vibes, music sounds awesome (gabber)..<br />xtc (pills)/mdma 15+ times: awesome drug - when i took it first time and a guy asked what music do you listen to, said - you wouldn&#039;t know it&#039;s hardcore (gabber) - he took me to his car packed up with stereo and played a dj promo - killerz.. I thought i will cum there. Since then I always try to listen to music with mdma/xtc. I even do a once per year &#039;solo tour&#039; - just me, some mdma and some hardcore...<br />Metylone (bk-mdma) ~5times - only did micro-doses. A nice sobering effect (Somehow, after 15 years of drinking I don&#039;t tolerate alcohol so much - 3/4 pints of beer is a absolute maximum for me.. and around 12 I&#039;m all sleepy and drunk;) - and this thing keeps me through the night. Haven&#039;t tried normal doses yet... (p.s. music sounds awesome too;)<br />Hash cake 1 time: a quite long trip (~6-7 hours).. well we did smoked some more after about 3/4 hours:) - A interesting experience. Bit different than smoking. Can&#039;t say it was awesome, but.. strolling through some kind of city-day&#039;s fair full of people, food and stuff was quite interesting;)<br />Weed/hash 20/30+: Best experience when smoking with a vaporizer. Or getting stoned on hash and watching through the wormhole with morgan freeman on discovery - that day i understood what dark matter really is - it&#039;s time... well, not time, but snapshots of time stored within the universe =)<br />Salvia 3 times: no real effect :(<br />EDIT: forgot these 2<br />Cocain - 1x: Found it utterly useless. Mephedrone, small doses of mdma, or methylone give the same energy, but at much leser cost, and most importantly - risk.<br />MDAI 2x: Was pressed into tablets - first time took 3 tabs - effects were very, very minimal, yes - mydriasis, some very minuscule mdma-like effects, but when my friends went somewhere to clubs, i just had a very strong urge to lie down, so went home lie down in front of tv.. so would categorize this as &#039;meh&#039; drug;)<br /><br />that&#039;s my boring list.. <br /><br />EDIT2: after some research narrowed my psy-to-try down to DMT. Or is dmt only for &#039;expert-trippers&quot;, maybe i should start with shrooms?

				Toxin, if you have any repressed feelings or anything, it&#039;s not recommended to take any psys unless you want the drug to help you face it and resolve it. Shrooms are fine, but take a low dose first then work your way up to stronger doses. DMT seems way too powerful for your first time, in my opinion.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t done much, but here you go:<br /><br />Shrooms: Everything in my room came to life and wanted to play with me. It made me feel like I was 4 years old again. :)<br /><br />Salvia: Uncontrollable laughter, time sped up, mild visual distortions<br /><br />Weed: Since the time I did shrooms, every time I smoke weed, I get mild visuals (like colors darkening and becoming more sharp, etc.) and I feel like I get high more easily now.<br /><br />DXM (lol): Couldn&#039;t finish the entire bottle (it was the worst thing I&#039;ve ever tasted) but drank about 2/3&#039;s of it. Dancing became really fun and I just couldn&#039;t stop dancing for like 15 minutes. After an hour or two, my arms and legs felt dissociated from me and I had weird mild CEV&#039;s. (I could see myself inside my head but it wasn&#039;t that intense)<br /><br />Ephedrine: Very nice relaxing body high, nothing powerful. Became speedy after few hours.<br /><br />4-AcO-DMT: Nothing besides very very mild visuals. Will try again later by putting it inside an empty gel cap.<br /><br />Kratom: Nice buzz. I&#039;ve never done opiates but other people say Kratom has an opiate-like buzz. The feeling was like being really buzzed from alcohol but without the dizziness. I get easily irritated though. Threw up when I tried going for 10g. Gonna stick with 6-7g from now on.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m getting some LSD and Mescaline soon. Can&#039;t wait. :)

So i drown that little bitch in alcohol and drugs;).. kidding;)<br />DMT sounds awesome because of its short duration. If I will not like it - so what I can loose 15-20 minutes of my time. On the other hand if I will like it.. I was thinking maybe starting my psy adventures with DMT is like trying heroin before alcohol, sex, tobacco, week and so on. Could this be that after dmt all the other psys would juslt feel like &#039;meh&#039; ?
