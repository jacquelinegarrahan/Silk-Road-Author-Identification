				$50 an eighth is an extreme overprice. Try $30 or maybe even $35 if your area has no shrooms. I wouldn&#039;t sell more than $30 just because I don&#039;t like to have people feeling like they have been ripped off.

				really depends on where you are, but since you can&#039;t give that info away, i would say you could easily charge 40/eighth...50 if shrooms really are crazy rare in your area.&nbsp; last i checked though, it&#039;s really easy to grow shrooms and it would be even cheaper that way.&nbsp; your margins would be insane.

				So I&#039;m about to try shrooms for the very first time.&nbsp; I&#039;m kind of nervous...not about the trip but about the possibility of getting sick, throwing up, etc.&nbsp; Is this common?&nbsp; Is there anything I could do to help this..&nbsp; I was thinking about putting the mushrooms on a pizza and just eating the pizza.&nbsp; But that might be a horrible idea.<br />Is this a common problem?&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for any advice on hot to actually ingest these

				Guess it all depends on where you live! Shrooms are cheap in my area<br />$100/oz<br />$35/quad, can&#039;t even get 1/8&#039;s. <br />It&#039;s funny, too,cause when I joined,I thought I would run into cheaper prices on SR, but was surprised to see 99% of EVERYTHING was 2x as much as street!! <br />Well,EXCEPT for DMT, which is about 3-4X cheaper on here, which REALLY bummed me out! DMT is $200/g where I live.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also,to avoid stomach problems, you can grind them into a fine powder. Most people get stomach aches because the fibers of the shroom are too difficult for your stomach to break down properly. And then you throw up. Isn&#039;t the human machine awesome?<br /><br />I&#039;m also with RowdyRasta, don&#039;t bake em. I don&#039;t even like chocolates,as melted choc is hot, and heat kill psylocybin &amp; psylocin.

				Anything is worth whatever somebody is willing to pay for it... just remember that. Also, the price is set in the black-market by how well you know the other person and how much of a dick/ how nice the seller is.

				In all honesty from my experiences in many areas with many groups of people, solid shroom connections are rarer in the average communities. 30 an 1/8th is how you need to go though. Don&#039;t be a dick with odd numbers. 40 and 1/8th if high grade cannabis/lsd/mdma is a little higher in your community.

Ive seen 25-30 when people are friendly with the connect and about 40 on the high end when they did not. 50 Seems a little high, but if there is really that low of supply you might be able to get some business
