				How&#039;s it going guys, n&#039; gals. Viscoto here, and im here to stay. <br />After about a month of inner negotiations, and 60 bucks to spend. I throw to the wind in hopes of getting some Nbome Complexed tabs. But before doing so i plan on figuring the more inter workings of PGP tonight before placing my order. But from a future customer, i love the place, and it was exactly as i thought it would be(that is a website like amazon, that sells chems, and other delightful things ^.-) <br /><br />Well i&#039;m off to do some reading. <br />Have fun, and be safe yo!

				Hi Guys ,<br />I am a newbie who has been looking for this place for a long time but I will be doing a bit of buying and selling pretty quickly.&nbsp; Am 3rd year chemistry drop out. Never got my degree but by that time I had learned to make pretty much all of Pihkal . I wish to f%%K now I had finished because there seems to be a hell of a market on the old acid just now. I love all things psychedelic and uppers. I never do anything that will depress my CNS. The war on drugs does that on its own. My hero is Casey Hardison . Hell he did his Nelson Mandela bit&nbsp; on principle for LSD. So anyway I have a couple of landmarks that I would like to achieve over the next 10 years. I want to make L Cocaine out of nightshade and I want to follow Caseys LSD synth which I do not have yet but he will be out in another&nbsp; years if he behaves himself. All help will be gratefully accepted and if i can be of assistance with my meagre knowledge then&nbsp; feel free to ask. I like to fart around in the lab trying out new stuff and am always happy to have friendly guinea pigs&nbsp; to share the wealth if it doesnt kill me first of course.

				I first found this place after it first hit the news. At the time I linked through and couldn&#039;t see any way to join and figured it was invite-only.&nbsp; At that time I hadn&#039;t really started smoking yet anyway, so I put it out of my mind and the months went by.&nbsp; When I did start smoking (just got curious and came to it all on my own... didn&#039;t have a joint shoved into my face at a party or anything, etc.) I went through a relative to get a couple local hookups.&nbsp; The quality was always a shot in the dark and being somewhat of a hermit I didn&#039;t like having to interact with the shady underworld in town anyway.&nbsp; I gave the Road another shot a few months ago and fortunately this time there was a sign up link on the login page.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made 3 orders now for personal amounts of cannabis from Canadian (domestic) vendors and couldn&#039;t be happier. As a geek, the technical hurdles to overcome were actually an added point of interest for me rather than barriers.&nbsp; Other than smoking pot I&#039;m an extremely law-abiding citizen and never thought it would feel like such an honour to be part of this revolution. :)

				Welcome aboard!&nbsp; Word of advice, be careful with the nbome&#039;s, they can be very intense and unpredictable.&nbsp; Good luck! I hope you have much success (as I have).&nbsp; That goes for all noobs on this thread.
