				So, I&#039;m high.&nbsp; And I am thinking of ways to smoke discreetly like using a cologne hitter or a dugout with the cigarette/bat painted to look like a cigarette.&nbsp; For those of you who don&#039;t know, a cologne hitter is an empty tissue roll with a bounce dryer sheet inside.&nbsp; You take a hit, then exhale into the end of the paper tube and through the dryer sheet.&nbsp; This air that exits the other end doesn&#039;t smell like dope!&nbsp; <br /><br />I digress.&nbsp; What innovations have allowed you to toke like a good bloke?&nbsp; What keeps the parents/spouse/5-oh at bay in your life?

				Not that it has anything to do with stealth but reading this thread just reminded me of all the ways I used to smoke pot as a kid in Jr. High School:<br /><br />1. Rolled up a piece of tinfoil.<br />2. Took the pen out of a bic pen and widened one end to make a bowl covered with tinfoil.<br />3. Cored an apple with a pen almost all the way through and then used a needle to poke holes and create a &quot;bowl&quot; on the other side.<br />4. Toilet paper rolls with tinfoil bowls.<br />5. Empty school milk cartons with tinfoil bowls.<br /><br />Stealth, in Jr. High School terms, was accomplished by smoking under a jacket or hoodie.<br />

				i&#039;ve only used a &#039;cologne hitter&#039; at friends or family&#039;s houses who asked me to.&nbsp; <br /><br />Honestly I&#039;ve always just kind of stepped out for a cigarette, went around the corner, hit the pipe, continued smoking cigarette..

				I had a buddy who had to spend a long time in hospital due to a bike accident. He loved his bongs at the time, and smuggling the bong in was easy... But what to do with the smoke???<br />Well,&nbsp; my mate got so bored in there that he started blowing up latex gloves and taking pot shots at the bin on the other side of the room.... Problem solved! <br />He&#039;d&nbsp; smoke a cone, exhale into a latex glove and throw it at the bin. The nurses were happy to let this go on as it relieved his boredom and supplied him with as many gloves as he needed.<br /><br />

				Stealth is critical here in Thailand where a little reefer can get you 2-15 years.&nbsp; I love the vape idea with the two-way valve so you exhale through a cologne hitter.&nbsp; The smoke buddy looks great but for size.

				Remember that drink like 15 years ago called Element that came in metallic bottles? Carefully cut the bottom off, sanded it, then installed tiny air inlet holes, a very small buttom and a mount for a new false bottom which contained batteries and a nichrome heating element and weed chamber.&nbsp; Press the button for a few seconds and suck through the container like you are drinking from it.&nbsp; I would just smoke in plain sight at a distance at school.

				I use a Magic Flight Launch Box.<br /><br />http://www.magic-flight.com/<br /><br />Its a very stealthy, very efficient portable vape.<br /><br />I have used it in packed cinemas etc before.<br /><br />When used correctly (and I will say now that you need to learn how to draw correctly on one of these, just mindlessly sucking on one will not work very well) 0.1g will get you high!, There is very little smell, but the smell dosent smell like weed, its more like burned popcorn.&nbsp; &nbsp;The smell also dissapears in under 1 minute (its only a slight smell, it dosent last long and it dosent smell like weed!)<br /><br />I regularly take this with me when I go out.&nbsp; I try and nip off to somewhere thats a bit discrete, but if thats not possible then Ill use it right in front of people.&nbsp; Its so small that you can do it infront of people and it just looks like you have your fist clenched infront of your face.<br /><br />The only other thing I should mention is that it needs the weed to be ground much finer than most grinders do.&nbsp; So if anyone is thinking of getting one then make sure you get the little grinder that MF sell too.<br /><br />
