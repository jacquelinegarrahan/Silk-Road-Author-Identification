				I hate this shit man, I have been stuck at my fiances friends house for it seems like all day now and I cannot get my SILK to connect on my laptop.&nbsp; Granted I have no idea what is on my laptop anymore since it has been sitting in a grocery bag with the power cord for well over a year now.&nbsp; It just sucks I thought my thumb drive was configured to run everything from drive.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t matter, installed pidgin to laptop itself and still cant get SILK to work once generating new key pair.&nbsp; It has been pissing me the FUCK off!<br /><br />The laptop is older but was top of the line when I built it.&nbsp; But we all know that isn&#039;t saying much since technology is old the day you buy it.&nbsp; This POS I put together back in 2005 and is maxed in tech from the day but still runs like a dog.&nbsp; No wonder I never use the damn thing and just run the desktop, plus this thing likes to overheat for some unknown reason.&nbsp; It never started overheating until about a year after build.&nbsp; Since it started I have re-set the CPU and GPU with some arctic silver thinking that was the issue, changed fans, mad bigger openings for fans (of course I dusted the bitch).&nbsp; It just likes crashing even with a fresh load of XP.<br /><br />I think when I get home that is what is needed, fresh install of XP pro!&nbsp; It&#039;s only a centrino 2.0ghz with 2gig RAM and forget the GPU (kinda fucked up) but it was the whip in the day!<br /><br />I think it is just me trying to config things to run off flash going from Win7 to XP or something but who knows?&nbsp; This is just a RANT!&nbsp; I sometimes hate this thing, sometimes love it...But it has been sitting in a fucking grocery bag for over a year it seems.&nbsp; I generally know my shit when it comes to PC&#039;s whether it be PC or Linux, but this cat has pissed me off!<br /><br />Better times are coming, finally leaving this place and going home to my humble abode or whatever!&nbsp; A place with securely running OS, everything with hours of debugging, VS now this POS sitting in a closet for a year.&nbsp; OK love everyone except you fuckin SCAMMERS!<br /><br />Peace<br />bupebuddy

				This is turning into a true rant!&nbsp; So I went to leave my friends last night and we get not even a mile away, the whole time the car is not running worth a shit.&nbsp; I cannot get it to rev above 3k RPM and can&#039;t exceed 35mph unless going downhill.&nbsp; Well anyway we turned around since it was 130AM and slept on an air mattress at the friends.&nbsp; This morning we had her follow us home.&nbsp; I had my 4-ways, my friend behind me, and 20 following her.&nbsp; The car just broke down a month ago and I lucked out and had it towed for free compliments of my last employer.&nbsp; At that time I got it running perfect! I mean, I went through the whole fuel and ignition systems and diagnosed the ICM and replaced.&nbsp; Everything else was fine, getting 60+psi to the fuel rails.<br /><br />Just about 3 days ago the brakes go out, and I mean out there are none! E-Brake only!&nbsp; Well I had to drive it and down shifted to get it slowed down enough then applied e-brake to stop.&nbsp; During this time I think I have plugged the CAT.&nbsp; It has no power.&nbsp; I can put my foot to the floor in neutral/park and it wont rev passed 3k!&nbsp; I&#039;m freaking the fuck out, this is the only vehicle between my GF and I.&nbsp; She just got a job which is about 25miles away and starts tomorrow.&nbsp; I have been unemployed for 3 months searching for jobs within a 5ish mile radius due to being limited to a pedal bike.&nbsp; This is lovely, I can&#039;t imagine whats coming next!<br /><br />Sorry for the rant but fuck this sucks!&nbsp; On top of it all I have started my own cleaning business and cannot get to my few clients homes without the vehicle.&nbsp; Its tough starting a business, there is a ton of competition and the limits we have with only 1 vehicle..err I mean 0 vehicles.<br /><br />FUCK FUCK FUCK

				Grey bud,<br /><br />You are something else, helping, kind, commendable, I could go on.&nbsp; I&#039;m not looking for a pitty party or anything just somewhere to vent.&nbsp; The people here are some of the nicest people I know.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have many friends IRL due to my drug problems, but have been mostly clean for a year now.&nbsp; Yes I do get some junk maybe once a month but I want a treat!&nbsp; I am doing good I&#039;m not causing problems, I feel like I am doing everything right.&nbsp; I have applied for probably over 60 jobs in the past 3 months and haven&#039;t landed a thing.&nbsp; It&#039;s the holiday season everyone needs extra help, WTF hire me.&nbsp; I am very smart and can do anything from auto mechanics computer repair customer service, you name it.&nbsp; I have been the best at each and every one of my jobs before I left.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a criminal record (so what I have a misde)&nbsp; I know felons who have no probs getting jobs.<br /><br />My dad works doing collision repair and is a fair mechanic but him and I are not speaking so every text to him has gone unanswered.&nbsp; I am 90% sure my CAT convert is plugged due to downshifting with the brakes being out.&nbsp; I was planning on fixing the brakes today, but why do that if the car is dead.&nbsp; I can&#039;t even make it to the auto store!&nbsp; I have replaced the EGR valve just now and that did nothing.&nbsp; I just changed the ICM last month when it broke down and happened to grab an extra so I will put that on now and see what happens.&nbsp; I know it isn&#039;t gonna do shit but why not right? I have to do something

				Well hope fully things will work out!&nbsp; My girlfriend missed her first day at work today due to the vehicle not running and having no one to take her.&nbsp; She called and they are still willing to give her the job as long as she can make it in tomorrow.&nbsp; Well her vehicle is still not running but I have made progress.&nbsp; Her friend is supposed to take her in tomorrow.&nbsp; The blazer has no brakes whatsoever.&nbsp; E brake only!<br /><br />I have found where the break line is broken.&nbsp; Just have to get some line and make sure everything unblots correctly, being a crusty old rusty ass blazer from the 90&#039;s in winter climate.&nbsp; Makes working on these things a bitch!&nbsp; Finally got my dad to talk to me.&nbsp; He isn&#039;t going to help me, but he is going to bring me some tools such as a code reader and fuel pressure gauge.&nbsp; I&#039;m excited about that but fuck, I just wish I never had these problems.<br /><br />Now I need myself a job!&nbsp; I gotta hit the applications hard again tomorrow after I get done working on the blazer.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see why I don&#039;t have a job yet I have been applying for over 3 months and with everyone needing holiday help I figured I&#039;d be in somewhere.&nbsp; At this point I dont care what I&#039;m doing as long as it isn&#039;t fast food.&nbsp; I am well qualified for many jobs, but it seems that doesn&#039;t matter.

				Fucking hell!&nbsp; Worked my ass off all day in the blistering cold trying to get that stupid blazer running.&nbsp; I got no where with it.&nbsp; I was thinking the CAT was plugged, so I drilled a couple little holes right at the beginning of it but I don&#039;t think they were big enough to unrestrict the air enough.&nbsp; I also put a new fuel filter in.&nbsp; Man that was a motherfucker!&nbsp; The old one would not come out.&nbsp; I ended up cutting the bitch out.&nbsp; Then I had to put new steel gas line in, which I had to bend and cut to the perfect lengths and connect to the old lines with compression fittings.&nbsp; Well I didn&#039;t have the tools to bend the pipe so I was forced to use pliers and figure a way to get nice even bends without kinking the lines and breaking them.&nbsp; It took me hours to get done what should have taken 20 min.&nbsp; I also had to change out a rear break line.&nbsp; Surprisingly that was not a problem, usually you fight with them and sometimes break a fitting.<br /><br />The fucking car is still not running for shit though!&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what to do.&nbsp; I think I am just going to cut the CAT off.&nbsp; It will be noisy as fuck but at least I will know if that is the true problem or not.&nbsp; Since I live less than a mile from PD hopefully I don&#039;t get a ticket.&nbsp; Oh wait go to jail...(suspended license)

				Live just keeps getting better and better, NOT!<br /><br />So 3 days ago I get home and the power is off.&nbsp; I think no big deal consumers will be out here shortly to fix the problem.&nbsp; Well turns out it wasn&#039;t an electrical problem, Consumers Energy had actually shut off my utilities.&nbsp; I did not have a clue what to do as it is freezing where I live.&nbsp; The bottom line is My fiance and I lived here for 3 days straight without heat :(.&nbsp; It was horrible!&nbsp; The internal temp of the house dropped down to somewhere around 45deg Farenheight.&nbsp; Horrible to say the least.<br /><br />I thought I had everything figured out.&nbsp; Her and I were just going to have the utilities switched over to her name, only downfall with that was it could take up to five das to hve someone come out and turn everything on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like I said it is one of the most horrible experiences I have lived through.<br /><br />They never turned off the gas, just the electric.&nbsp; Although I have a gas heater it does take power to run the blower moter which distributes the heat throuout out the home ( and without the elec the furnace at there unused).&nbsp; I have never experienced anytjomg along these lines.&nbsp; Let me just tell everyone/anyone listening that I wish this upon nobody, not even my worst nemesys.<br /><br />Everything is now up and running like it was previous due to the previous problems power outage and my bad luck. I hope you all see the problems I have been having and are understandable.&nbsp; I &lt;3 my opiates and I would love to sell them but they are &quot;dangerous&quot;.&nbsp; I need the money more than ever right now.&nbsp; I have never lost power in,&nbsp; I have just opened a new addio
