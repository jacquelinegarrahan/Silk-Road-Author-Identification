(CBC)<br /><br />But upon closer inspection, operations manager Scott Mills said something was clearly amiss.<br /><br />The envelopes were printed with low resolution Jukebox logos, and inside, entire paragraphs from the company’s website were lifted and printed on a flyer. But tucked in between the pages were small, square stickers.<br /><br />&quot;The stickers were a little eerie looking,&quot; Mills said. &quot;They had psychedelic pictures on it. They were thicker.&quot;<br /><br />Mills said the company called Vancouver Police, but the last officer they spoke to said the mystery envelopes were just junk mail and advised them to put the letters in the garbage.<br /><br />But Mills sent the stickers to a lab instead and discovered they were laced with LSD.<br /><br />The illegal hallucinogen – which is odourless, colourless and tasteless – is often painted onto small pieces of paper that people lick or swallow.<br />Operations manager Scott Mills worries the printing materials the company sends to its clients could be flagged by international customs. Operations manager Scott Mills worries the printing materials the company sends to its clients could be flagged by international customs. (CBC)<br /><br />&quot;Our worst fears were realized,&quot; Mills said. &quot;It could potentially be a drug smuggling ring going internationally because each of the three envelopes that we got returned were from the States.&quot;<br /><br />The Gastown-based company, which prints and ships business cards and other promotional materials to people and businesses all around the world, says they want people to know they are not shipping LSD.<br /><br />Mills worries that the printing materials Jukebox sends to its clients could be flagged by international customs.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vancouver police now admit it was a mistake to dismiss the company’s concerns.<br /><br />&quot;We’re taking this very seriously. This may be the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said VPD spokesman Sgt. Randy Fincham.<br /><br />&quot;There may be a small number of packages returned to the company but possibly a larger number reached their intended recipients, whether in the U.S., other areas in Canada or possibly foreign countries.&quot;<br /><br />There is one potential clue found on the envelopes: the cancellation mark applied on the postage stamp indicates the letters were originally mailed from Vancouver, which means whoever stole Jukebox&#039;s identity isn&#039;t far away.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t think I have ever seen a story where someone got busted because they bought BTC or had stuff sent to a legit address. Most stories I see of people getting caught are a result of someone using a bogus address and having the package(s) returned.

				What hasn&#039;t already been revealed? This is a news story that is being posted on other forums and whoever the vendor is better change their shipping technique because LEO is now on to this particular front. <br /><br />If a mod thinks that this thread needs to me taken down or a link needs to be removed then so be it. I&#039;m not trying to be difficult, but I don&#039;t think taking the thread down or removing a link is going to provide anyone more safety. <br /><br />Maybe SR needs to make users take a quiz before they can make purchases. SR could provide a study guide that includes basic info such as &quot;use a legit address and name&quot; to avoid dumb shit like this occurring. <br /><br />Just a thought.

				1.) THIS THREAD SHOULD BE DELETED. Yes, law enforcement is aware of this shipping technique now, but that doesn&#039;t mean the police have associated these packages with Silkroad and to the vendor (you know who) in particular. If the thread stays open, it&#039;s more likely to be linked to Silkroad.<br /><br />2.) One good thing about this story: we now have definitive lab test proof that we are getting real LSD from this particular vendor. :) Now I can be rest assured that my previous LSD experiences were the real deal, not some research chemical that mimics the effects of LSD.

				I don&#039;t think the thread should be deleted or locked. What is the point of doing that? The vendor is obviously secure enough that they have not been arrested so far, and they are unlikely to be arrested through what they mailed unless they left forensic evidence like fingerprints on it. The people who had shit sent to wrong addresses are not going to get busted either because they gave incorrect addresses. Hopefully they didn&#039;t have it sent to their real names with wrong addresses though!
