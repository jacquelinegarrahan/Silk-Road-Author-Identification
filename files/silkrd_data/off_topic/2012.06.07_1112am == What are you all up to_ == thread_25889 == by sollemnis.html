				What did I see.. hmm.. might be a bit different than normally because I was also on 2c-b but I could just go anywhere I wanted to do everything I want. <br />It was also quite confronting, don&#039;t know why exactly anymore but it felt that way :P<br />Also sometimes I didn&#039;t know whether I had my eyes open or not lol.<br />And when I was like 75% into the hole my roommates came knocking on my door asking if I came for a drink, that was a bit of a downer, slammed me back to the real world quite hard :P Good thing next line knocked me right into the hole :D

I felt waaaaay more than the last times I tried Keta, which was closely after MXE use.

				I knew it would happen because damn, IT WAS K NIGHT, would be boring if no one holed! It&#039;s funny knowing other people have holed! <br /><br />I&#039;d have felt like a failure if I didn&#039;t encourage one fucker to hole&nbsp; :(
