				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />I am thinking of taking MDMA and Cocaine together and was wondering if this is:-<br /><br />A. A good idea <br /><br />B. what effects should I expect?<br /><br />Are there any others that the informative and progressive SR community would recommend?<br /><br />I appreciate any feedback given:)<br /><br />

				MDMA + anything can be nice if you do it right. Make sure you have enough coke to redose throughout your trip. Also make sure you drink plenty of water (not booze) and don&#039;t overheat. If you have never done it before E + cola can be kind of overwhelming so make sure you have a spotter or other people around. Have fun + be safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;:D

				Personally not a fan of MDMA + cocaine. It makes my heart beat way too fast, just doesn&#039;t feel particularly safe.. I was dancing at a rave on this combo but had to stop because I was worried about my heart rate.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like combining two drugs that are hard on your heart/body. MDMA + LSD/2CB/ketamine can be really fun imo.

				OOH! One thing I forgot to mention is only ever think of doing this if you have clean, pure MDMA. Don&#039;t do it if you are rolling with pills that might contain speed or even MDA as the heart rate thing can be an issue as Gigles mentioned. Can feel like your heart is gonna pop right out of your body and run away.

				I&#039;m not a big fan of the MDMA/coke combo. You get a good MDMA high going, and then the coke tends to cancels it out (for me at least). Also, if the MDMA is speedy, things can get sketchy. <br />MDMA + Ketamine is a great combo. <br />Coke + GHB is also a good one, the GHB cuts through the coke sketch waaay faster than liquor. Just don&#039;t overdo it if you don&#039;t have much G experience. G flailers are funny.

				MDMA + MDA is good. MDMA + MDA + coke is not something I would recommend. Too much rush for most people. Seriously will make your heart beat at like 900 MPH and is not comfortable at all.

				MDMA with 15-30mg of 2c-b after the peak is an awesome combo. Dunno about Ket + MDMA sounds like it would be pretty weird.

				Ketamine on the MDMA comedown is lovely for me. Coming back from a party with some friends, chilling with some music and then a little line of K. Walk on clouds, feel like your made out of cardboard and experience how it feels likew hen your limbs are not yours! Fun for the whole family! :o ::) :P<br /><br />Small bump of coke when being on MDMA. Not too much, fucks up the MDMA high.<br /><br />GHB with MDMA. Welcome to heaven! Watch out with dosing of the GHB though, drooling over yourself isn&#039;t cool on party.<br /><br />MDMA with minor dose of 4-fluoramphetamine. Ideal for anyone with a higher tolerance too MDMA. I&#039;ve been using MDMA for years now (6- 10 times a year or so), sometimes MDMA makes me a couch potato. Roughly 30 mg of 4-FMA on every 100 mg of MDMA extends the overall rush and gives you a bit more energy. <br /><br />MDA with... well, a few cold beers. Watch the curtains wave at you and your buddys!<br /><br />Coke with a few beers. Conservative mix but can&#039;t be beaten.<br /><br />Coke with a good glass of malt whisky. May I suggest a Lagavulin 16 years?<br /><br />

				meth + ketamine<br /><br />meth + ghb<br /><br />xanax + pain meds + soma<br /><br />gabapentin works well 4 hours before sleepy time for opiate users.

				MDMA + __________? = Happy energetic empathetic dancing?<br />Since I&#039;ve given up on street pills and stick to SR&#039;s &quot;known-ingredients&quot; magic, I&#039;m not sure what makes me super zoned in to music and want to dance. The MDMA alone is awesome but I want to chill on the floor, not RAGE! <br />Maybe add some of that dutch speed??<br /><br />Your thoughts?

				Pregabalin works well with weed, alcohol(2 drinks max), oxycodone and other opiates, and some Chinese food, &#039;cause you get mad munchies.<br /><br />Marijuana enhances pretty much everything, in my opinion, though I&#039;ve yet to have a bad reaction from it<br /><br />Cocaine and Opiates pair very well, not necessarily a true speed ball, but I love mixing some Opana or Roxi in my lines<br /><br />Opiates and benzodiazepines are great together, though be cautious with dosage. 20mg of Oxycodone and 6-12mg Lorazepam is a great mellow buzz<br /><br />I am too high and tired to type any more, I&#039;ll make camp here and go for the summit tomorrow.<br /><br />

				Coke followed by 6mg lorazepam (Ativan).&nbsp; A coke binge then the Ativan kills it and puts you in a nice state of sleep.&nbsp; Maybe this doesn&#039;t count.&nbsp; I have a scrip for the Ativan.&nbsp; Nice combo though.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also added half a hydrocodone to the mix.&nbsp; Hope this isn&#039;t dangerous.&nbsp; Somebody please tell me if it is.

				It can be dangerous to stack drugs that do the same thing like speed + coke or benzo + opiate. Lots of people have done it seeking a better buzz and some have died. Be careful. Go under your normal dose until you know how the combination affects you. <br /><br />Some fire dope and ice meth is a good chemical high. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m coming or going. Rush then relaxation. It&#039;s doctor recommended too. :P<br /><br />I like some Valium to take the edge off speed or coke so I don&#039;t feel as tweaked and anxious and to help me sleep when I run out. <br /><br />My best trips were with San Pedro cactus extract + mushrooms and MDMA + mushrooms.<br /><br />I agree that nitrous can take an experience to another level. It&#039;s ok with weed but was mind blowing under the influence of LSD or mushrooms. It&#039;s hard to describe it.
