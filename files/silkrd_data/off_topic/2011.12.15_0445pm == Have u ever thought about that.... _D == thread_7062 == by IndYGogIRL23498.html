				1st of all I&#039;m not LE<br /><br />I just read a lot of posts where ppl are keep screaming LE!!!<br /><br />Then suddenly something came to my mind,<br /><br />What do u think how many &quot;bad&quot; cops are out there, buying dope of the SR?<br />I mean, they cant buy them p2p.. so they dont have a choice.<br />And as far as I&#039;m concerned there are a lot of cops doing drugs especially in the states.<br />

				They don&#039;t have to buy anything, they just need to report less of what they found during a traffic stop or bust/raid and keep the rest.

				I know a few cops who are crazy into drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even the ones that don&#039;t work narcotics specifically just trade favours with the guys that do and make friends, and in exchange get tons of product.&nbsp; Not to mention the money.<br /><br />I KNOW what human nature is all about.&nbsp; That&#039;s why I could never let myself become a cop.&nbsp; I would be the most crooked cop on the damned streets lol.

				When I was a teenager, many moons ago lol, all the cops in my town used to buy from the same guy I worked for.&nbsp; We would see them walking in and out of the back room...they would say to us &quot;I&#039;m gonna tell your mother I saw you here&quot; lol but they never did.&nbsp;
