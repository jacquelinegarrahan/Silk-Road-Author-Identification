				What do you guys think..... whats harder for you to control use with and also what do you find more taxing on your overall health/life?<br /><br />Alot of people say that opiates ie.heroin, oxy are alot more addictive than cocaine for example but for me I find that I can control opiates alot better when it comes to dosing than stims. Cocaine is a horrible drug for me to try and control and by the end of my cycle of use i spent all my cash and the cash i borrowed my nose is fucked to shit and bleeding all the time etc. With oxy or heroin for example I can binge for&nbsp; a week or so and stop and feel fine like a million bucks no bleeding nose or any depression in sight.The downside with this is that I KNOW ill never stop using heroin...coke I really couldnt care less if I ever saw it again I think i developed an allergy to it or something. I threw psychs in ther just for fun maybe well out some dmt addicts lol 8)

				I think only the clinically insane can get hooked on psychedelics! The fact that they are so non-addictive says something about there effects doesn&#039;t it? You have to have a pretty wild imagination to get anything &quot;useful&quot; from psychedelics. Meth is more useful - it makes me feel good and I enjoy it!<br /><br />I find both reasonably tricky to control. Though I can surprisingly use meth most responsibly of all stimulants and I was using poppy tea once or (rarely) twice a week for years with absolutely no ill effects. Recently went on a week long speed binge using poppy tea to round of the edges after drinking the tea almost every night for a month..... For a week after that I experienced my first true drug-induced withdrawal/crash. Never felt so miserable, I felt absolutely and utterly helpless. Aches and pains, couldn&#039;t get out of bed, could barely move, crying all the time, panic attacks whenever I smoked bud etc. I was seriously worried that I would never enjoy bud again...... :(<br /><br />For me though, this one time is enough to convince me I don&#039;t want to live the life of an addict!&nbsp; ;D Heroin will have to wait until I&#039;m an old man I think.<br />As much as I hate to say it these drugs cannot be used as much as your brain is telling you you should! For most people I think the best plan of action is to avoid them altogether, especially if you have pain in your life you would rather avoid. I&#039;m very stable and happy so my junkie tendencies stay under the surface&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />And Limetless, from what I&#039;ve read you are a pretty big meph user.... How is that treating you? Do you not get the fabled side effects such as vasoconstriction and visual blind spots?

				I do get SLIGHT vasoconstriction sometimes however I counter this with daily supplements of L-Argenine and other Vasodilators.

				Sedatives because I feel like I&#039;m in control until I&#039;m not. <br />With stims I can easily tell when I&#039;m going overboard. With sedatives I feel relaxed and easygoing about my use, but soon enough my tolerance is higher than the Himalayas.<br /><br />Psychedelics are my cup of tea these days and I have no problems spacing out trips. As for damage from psychedelics; it hurts my world views, but they recover.

				Ups/Downs together is IMO, the absolutely best. The harder the better, ie- freebasing while tooting some No.4...ohhh fuuck yea. You look like an absolute mess, but everything&#039;s ok&nbsp; ;D!

				Sorry i forgot the original pointy of the post&nbsp; :D. I believe Sedatives are most definitely harder to keep control of. They are a guaranteed plus, while most stims can occasionally give you the fear/anxiety...

				meth is very useful... if you want to churn out mindless tasks at the speed of light.<br /><br />psychedelics open up your mind and present you with new ideas and worldviews. you&#039;d have to be a psychopath to not get anything useful from psychedelics.<br /><br />that&#039;s not to say that one can have a purely mindless trip sometimes, and those are nice too :)
