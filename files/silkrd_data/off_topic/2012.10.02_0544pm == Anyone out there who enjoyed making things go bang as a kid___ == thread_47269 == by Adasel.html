				Everyone has done things as a youngster they regretted at some point.<br />For me was one instance where a friend showed me how to make a small &quot;fun&quot; explosive.<br />Basically all you did was take a penny, wrap it in a shit load of explosives and the wrap the whole thing in cellotape.<br />After that all you do is throw it, fuck me did it make some noise.<br />I have heard about people doing shit with tennis balls, packing them out with matchstick heads and then just lighting a fuse and throwing it.<br />Its classed as urban anarchy now, but im wondering if anyone else out there had that kind of fun as a kid, or if anyone had strange, ingenious ways of making things go bang.<br />I heard one about packing a big cola bottle with fertilizer although not sure how reliable this is.

				I once made a &quot;bomb&quot; out of those little snap pop things. I unrolled each of them and put the contents in a paper towel and lit the &quot;fuse&quot; and ran.<br /><br />It barely fizzled. I was highly disappointed.

				Yep, when I was younger I used to make deodorant can bombs, they were insane! Also sparkler bombs which were so loud. Some friends and I also made a 7ft+ long potato cannon made out of piping with a combustion camber and everything, in which you would spray butane and this would then be ignited with a BBQ lighter sending the potato for miles! If you got the air to butane mixture right it would be louder than a 12. shotgun! <br />Surprise I never killed myself when I was younger but they were good times. :)

				Yeah, 10 or so years ago my friends and I made explosives quite often. That was when you could buy black powder at a gun shop and no one would care. If we would&#039;ve done that stuff today... I bet all kind of government agencies would be after us thinking we were terrorists. oh nostalgia =)

				seriously, is there anyone who doesnt enjoy blowing things up??<br /><br />i was a freaking pyro as a kid, i have become more responsible and less reckless so moved onto things like shooting guns now.<br /><br />&nbsp;i would light anything on fire i could, including my entire backyard and myself for a movie we made for school. used to even breathe fire which was fun<br /><br />anyone else ever make MRE (meal ready to eat) bombs? just take the old style army MRE heaters and crush em up, add to some water in a two liter... then watch as the bottle expands to triple its normal size - then bursts with a surprisingly loud bang, throwing boiling liquid everywhere<br /><br />used to strap rocket engines to my batmobile and rocket it down the street which was always fun. rocket engines just upside down in a small hole were interesting cause they blow themselves like twenty feet in the air at the end - fireworks in a state where they werent accessible

				When I was 8, I took the powder out of two boxes of cap gun rounds. I carefully put it in a match box, and wrapped it in an old news paper. Together with my dad, we set it on fire in the garden. It went *whoosh*. Loved it.

				Me and my neighbor used to be real fucking psycho pyros. We made an electrolysis cell to synthesize potassium chlorate from potassium chloride and used the potassium chlorate to make explosives by mixing it with sulfur or red phosphorus (&quot;Armstrong&#039;s Mix&quot;). We made the best pipe bombs ever made by amateurs 8)
