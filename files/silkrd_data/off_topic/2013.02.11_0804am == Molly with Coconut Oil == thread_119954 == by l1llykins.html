				I decided to try some canadian brown sand with coconut oil. I scooped some coconut oil into the capsule, sprinkled the sand over it, then topped it off with more coconut oil before capping. <br /><br />I ended up having a steady come-up and peaked at around 30 minutes. Then I rolled for a solid 3 hours (I normally crash around or before the 3 hour mark). It was a steady decline to baseline after that, about another 2 hours before I was left with a nice afterglow. <br /><br />Anyway, it was a smooth ride and I&#039;m definitely going to try it again, maybe swirl the stuff into the coconut oil for a more even distribution and maximize absorption.&nbsp; 8)

				Love extra virgin coconut oil, the body recognises it as a carbohydrate and not an oil so it is instantly metabolised and not layed down as fat, makes it great for cooking up ganja treats.could well be why it worked so well with MDMA.<br />Great tip mate gonna try it soon.

				It was the extra virgin stuff. I heard that the combo may help more absorb into your system which seemed to be the case ... slowed down the absorption but also allowed more to be absorbed over time rather than a quick come-up followed by a deep crash at the end (as common when taking powder on an otherwise completely empty stomach). I never had a good press but the affects of presses are often described this way. I definitely feel like I got more for my buck! <br /><br />In any case, be sure to chime in once you try it.
