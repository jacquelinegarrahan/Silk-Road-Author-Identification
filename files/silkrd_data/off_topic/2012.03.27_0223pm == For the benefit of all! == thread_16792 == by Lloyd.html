				Good day everyone,<br /><br />TOR is quite slow and this is due to congestion within the TOR network (amongst a few other things). I reckon that SR probably is home to the majority of TOR users and this is why I thought that this would be the best place to post this.<br /><br />If each of us sets up a relay for the TOR network the speed of TOR will improve for all of us. Please would you consider setting up a relay to benefit the rest of the community.<br /><br />For help on setting up a relay and more information, go to: https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Lloyd

				I would feel find doing that if I wasn&#039;t doing business on SR.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; Am I wrong in thinking this?

				I would be pretty surprised if your conjecture about the majority of Tor users being from Silk Road is true.&nbsp; There are a LOT of reasons people want to surf anonymously, a lot of them shady and I&#039;m sure a lot not so shady.&nbsp; I mean, there are probably a fair number of Iranians and Chinese people etc. who just want to fucking go on facebook or youtube but can&#039;t because their government bans it.<br /><br />Running a tor relay is still a good way to benefit the community, but I still concur with others on not really wanting to take that risk.&nbsp; People do all sorts of shadier shit than buying drugs on darknet.&nbsp; Stuff I really don&#039;t want tied to me, even if it goes away when I tell authorities I&#039;m running a tor relay. No extra red flags for me, thanks.&nbsp; <br /><br />I may donate some bitcoins once I get those straight though.&nbsp; That seems like a better alternative and a good way to help the cause while preserving the thing I came to Tor for: anonymity.
