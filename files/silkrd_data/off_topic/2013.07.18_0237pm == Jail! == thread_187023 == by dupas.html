				Title: <strong>Jail!</strong><br />

				Hi girls and boys :)<br /><br />I would be interested what charges consumers of drugs face in the US. For example, they find&nbsp; 5g of heroin on you. How much time you in jail you would spend? Do you even have to go to jail for this amount?<br />5g of H were just an example. Would be interesting too to hear what the sentence is for other amounts/drugs, provided that you are only a user and not a dealer.<br /><br />Another interesting question: How do drug users from Thailand, Malaysia and other Asian&nbsp; countries with extremely strict drug laws fight their fear of being caught? Not to speak of dealer who could even face death penalty ...<br /><br />I think in most west European countries, you wouldn&#039;t go to jail as a user who is&nbsp; caught with 5g H on them.<br /><br />Do you have friends who only use and had to go to jail because of drugs?<br /><br />dupas

				In the US it will depend on if they are state or federal charges. Sentences for state charges can vary widely. You can get a 5 year sentence probated immediately, meaning you go home but you have to follow certain rules and of course get drug tested regularly. Federal charges follow more structured sentencing guidelines, which for drugs depend on the drug and the amount. You can find the federal sentencing guidelines online.

				Ok, so in general you won&#039;t go to prision if caught for the first time with an amount that can be considered for personal use. I thought that the US laws were pretty strict ...

A first time offender with a personal amount of drugs will almost certainly not do any jail time beyond the night he spends in jail on the initial arrest. He will have the option of going through a drug program / drug court, if that exists in his state. Repeat offenses, or aggravated offenses (involving a gun, for example) combined with large amounts of drugs can get you up to a mandatory life sentence, which is pretty draconian.<br /><br />Certainly not as bad as southeast Asia, though, where 15 grams of heroin is a capital offense.

				As far as I know, if you&#039;re caught in the US (at least in my state) with 5g of heroin, they throw you in a cell for life but give you free syringes and allow you access to SR and TOR.&nbsp; Many incarcerated folks receive SR packages up to once a day.&nbsp; They have scantly-clad ladies come in and help you shoot up if you&#039;re too tired to do it yourself.&nbsp; Then they do a little dance for you.&nbsp; There is an optional happy ending as long as you &quot;tip&quot; in BC.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pun intended.<br /><br />Oh, and they give you a 100BC/week allowance.&nbsp; It&#039;s all paid for by taxes.

				Interesting. Contrary to Europe in the US a life-time sentence is really life-time, whereas in Europe it&#039;s more like 20 years. Beside that, you won&#039;t get life-time for drug dealing in Europe anyways.<br /><br />Aren&#039;t there vendors from southeast Asia selling drugs on SR ? I really wonder how those guys overcome the fear of being caught by LE. I could never ever do this. I would be paranoid as fuck ;)<br /><br />I remember being on holiday in Malaysia. Once a completely stoned taxi driver asked me if i wanted to buy hash from him. He even gave me a telefon number i should call in chase I need drugs. Lol. He doesn&#039;t seem to be afraid at all. He just approached me when i was walking by with my girlfriend ...<br /><br />dupas

				Yeah, that Norwegian mass shooter got, what, 15 years or something? But the judge can extend it by 5 year increments and effectively keep him locked up for life.<br />
