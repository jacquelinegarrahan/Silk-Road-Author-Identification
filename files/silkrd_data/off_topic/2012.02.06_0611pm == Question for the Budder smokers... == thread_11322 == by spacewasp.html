				how the fuck do you deal with this stuff?<br /><br />I&#039;m a big fan of BHO and thought that budder would be similar in consistency (kinda gummy so you can pull off a little nuglet of it) but boy was I wrong.&nbsp; I tried freezing it for over an hour to see if it would be hard enough for me to get a little chunk off, but its still just a sticky gooey mess inside the pocket it came in.&nbsp; If I just leave it for a few days will it dry out a bit?&nbsp; do you store this stuff in the original packaging, or do you have a better way of storing it?<br /><br />My preferred method for smoking BHO is with an oil burner (sadly aka meth pipe) and I really don&#039;t want to smoke this on buds...much prefer to use it on its own.&nbsp; I was thinking that maybe with a medical syringe I could get some out and drop it into the oil burner...but its bad enough I&#039;ve got meth pipes laying around, but to have those AND syringes?&nbsp; jeez, if anyone unexpected comes over they&#039;re gonna think i&#039;ve gone off the deep end when really i&#039;m just a pot head.<br /><br />any thoughts?

				ok here is how ya do it, ive found myself in a pinch without all the handy tools etc... and it doesnt need to be cold, infact hot works better :p&nbsp; so you just take the corner of bag and cut a tiny little tiny corner cut in it, then you can squirt the budder out.&nbsp; when you cant squeeze anymore, just cut the bag so you can entirely open in, then just&nbsp; press it onto foil , when you lift up all the budder will stay on the foil and you can smoke it from there,... just little tips ive found ;p

				so, i think i&#039;ve changed my mind on my intentions here.<br /><br />First off, smoking budder in the oil burner is doing a number on my lungs due to the sheer heat of the vapor.&nbsp; If I take a hit the way I want to it burns pretty bad for 5 min or so.<br /><br />I was going to buy the &quot;green goddess&quot; vapor bubbler from aqua tech (their cheapest oil rig at $110), but after reading reviews I see that the glass nail is shite and you&#039;ll end up needing a titanium nail which is another 80 bucks or so.&nbsp; then I need a kitchen torch, which will be about 20, some dental picks for $5 or titanium dabber for 10.&nbsp; then I need to drop another 70 at least on more budder, so we&#039;re looking at almost $300.&nbsp; And I have reservations about this pipe, wondering if there&#039;s enough water space to really cool the vapor.&nbsp; so maybe i&#039;d need to be spending 300 or so on a vapor bong.&nbsp; so, basically, this is a really big investment and I still don&#039;t even know if it will cool the smoke enough for me. also, i don&#039;t like the idea of using blowtorches and red-hot titanium while getting stoned.<br /><br />but I am an e-cigarette smoker and see that Budderman also makes ecig liquid.&nbsp; i&#039;m skeptical as to how good of an experience this stuff really is (like, does it goo up the atomizer or cart real quick?&nbsp; can you get a thick cloud or does it end up weak and thin? and other concerns &amp; curiosities), but if its like my nicotine liquid it could be great solution to this lung-burning situation i&#039;m dealing with now.&nbsp; I think its worth the 120 to give it a whirl.&nbsp; so i&#039;ve decided on it<br /><br />btw, So grateful to SR and superstar vendors like Budderman for making options like this available to the common person.

				@dance4life<br /><br />Thanks for the review; glad to hear that this stuff is worth it.&nbsp; and thanks for the tip on jayesh, I was actually looking at his super cali haze and thinking that i might grab a quarter.&nbsp; It seems from his words that he is the grower and I really prefer my money to go straight to the grower; good price that way too!<br /><br />@FiveSeven<br /><br />I could do that, but I really prefer to smoke the budder on its own.&nbsp; weed mostly gives me a dopey kind of high, but when i smoke only oil or budder I get a really lucid and uplifting high.&nbsp; combining weed and concentrates gets me extra stoned out of my mind, but my goal is rather to ride a consistently mild high throughout the whole day

				Oh yes, just titanium nail with oil dome in a bong or bubbler is definitely awesome.<br /><br />And aqualabtech has an amazing selection for the smokers. Great professional customer service too.

				Are you a tobacco smoker?<br />I usually end up making little roll up cigarettes and using a cocktail pick, smearing the oil evenly down all sides of the paper. Takes a long time to do as the oil is so hard and sticky and doesn&#039;t transfer very well. <br /><br />When I do a butane extraction the oil I&#039;m left with is like pale glassy treacle- there&#039;s no way I can scrape up a ball of it, it&#039;s impossible and infuriating to handle but it softens if you immerse the container in warm water.

				This thread seems like a good place to ask...<br /><br />I&#039;m new to budder and wanted to know how to store it. Room temp or cold? I don&#039;t smoke often so would like to know the best way to store it and how long I can store it before it goes bad.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
