				Did any of you have to take D.A.R.E. in school? Drug Abuse Resistance Education, that is. Where a police officer came to your elementary school and spoonfed you all kinds of propaganda about how bad and dangerous drugs are. This was required in my school. Worked really well, didn&#039;t it? I started smoking weed at 14, lol.<br /><br />Please share your experiences.<br /><br />Jah Bless

				Both my other half and I were D.A.R.E. kids.. Still have at least one of the shirts around here.. I thought it was funny to wear to raves.. <br /><br />&nbsp;Funny enough, yeah it did work.. My other halfs father was a real hard nose, right wing straight edge&nbsp; kinda guy so between that and D.A.R.E. my other half was about 31 before touching an &quot;illegal&quot; substance and had never even been drunk before.. I am a horrible&nbsp; ;D, Terrible&nbsp; ;D, corrupting person that has brought both experiences to life... First had to get drunk, then talked into MDMA, then came the LSD followed by shrooms and herb .. Odd order I know but hey its what worked! LOL<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;As for me.. Between D.A.R.E. , Propaganda and not wanting to be anything even remotely like my mother...Some things I dipped into as a teen, others I am still warming up to and or fight with my self on.. Not that it makes a lot of sense but then its called brainwashing for a reason , RIGHT?

				Word, DARE&nbsp; worked fucking wonders for me!<br /><br />It taught me all about the lovely world of drooogs, lol..<br /><br />It was soo many years ago, but all i remember is drooling over that fucking little brief case! lol.. by the time i was 12 i was an all out junk box, lmao. That Fear &amp; Loathing starter kit was the apple of my eye, lol. At the time i wasnt wise enough to consider the possibility that it was all bunk shit though hehe

				Yes, I was brainwashed with all the other kids.<br /><br />Luckily I was blessed enough for my parents to send me to a private institution instead of these government run propaganda centers disguised as public schools!

				UK here so no DARE, but we had similar things including a workshop named &#039;Cannabis to Chaos&#039; which essentially involved parading a couple of ex-junkies in front of us and having them talk about how they started with weed.<br />The most nonsensical thing I remember were some of the &#039;drug education&#039; books I read...this was in the early 2000s and they were written in a kind of schizophrenic way, torn between &#039;don&#039;t do it&#039; and trying to be cool, like it was all our choice and they knew where we were coming from. <br />One book divided drugs into &#039;uppers, downers and weeeird&#039; and the &#039;weeeird&#039; was all written in green swirly writing. The page on LSD had psychedelic imagery in the background, while the text starkly warned us that we were all going to die of strychnine poisoning.<br />I was always interested in psychedelics and the teachers never told us shit about them so I read this garbage. One leaflet warned that &#039;on LSD, you may see things which frighten you!&#039; The first time I tripped I got hard into the headspace and laughed for about an hour about the fact that the leaflet really thought it would be what I SAW that messed me up. They never mentioned the mindfuck, no they did not...<br />Not as bad as DARE, but clueless all the same. I was lucky that my parents at least were far more open minded and would answer my questions honestly. The DARE shit really fucks kids up, I think there&#039;s a quote from Trent Reznor saying he got into heroin &#039;cos he was always told pot would kill you, and once he found out it wouldn&#039;t he couldn&#039;t believe any of it, the lies or the truth&nbsp; :(
