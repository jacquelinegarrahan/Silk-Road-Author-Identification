				Epipactis helleborine (L.) Crantz nectar has been found to contain the strongest naturally occurring opiate found in nature, oxycodone.&nbsp; Wasps tend to drink the nectar and crash down to the ground lol.&nbsp; Google it!

				Not to say your wrong and certainly not trying to pick a fight, but Oxycodone is a man made chemical that does not occur naturally. It does take a specific chemical from a particular plant for synthesis. But perhaps that wasps have the ability to change this chem from the orchid into something that gives the affects of a high powered opiate.? :o <br /><br />I&#039;ve been a WASP all my life! haha ;)&nbsp;

				Sounds familiar.<br /><br />In Australia we have &#039;Drop Bears&#039; which are a subspecies of the normal Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). <br /><br />The Drop Bears are usually placid, however upon ingestion of the Australian Tea Tree, they can&#039;t reduce the inherent poison in the Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia)** as efficiently as normal Wattle Trees and thus become highly agitated and outwardly aggressive.<br /><br />These Drop Bears then physically attack any passer underneath them....dogs, kangaroos, humans. They can inflict very nasty damage. Many unsuspecting tourists receive horrible facial wounds every year here. The weird thing is that the drop bear has a certain bacteria (related to the Indonesian Komono Dragon&#039;s saliva:&nbsp; E. coli, Staphylococcus sp., Providencia sp., Proteus morgani&#039;,&#039; and P. mirabilis) which prevents healing and can, in rare circumstances, result in death within a few days to a week.<br /><br />Now you know why we Australians keep well away from our forests...and obviously, not something we promote in our tourist brochures.<br /><br />So if you ever venture Down Under be damn careful of these nasty creatures...and keep well away from the forests!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />**According to the American Cancer Society: &quot;Tea tree oil is toxic when swallowed. It has been reported to cause drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, coma, unsteadiness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, blood cell abnormalities, and severe rashes. It should be kept away from pets and children.&quot;[22]

				They should give those bears some chronic. <br />Ever tried hanging from a tree after eating tea tree leaves?&nbsp; Ever tried it on weed, man? <br /><br />And to think in high school biology they taught us that ants are the only animals which willfully become intoxicated.&nbsp; Bullocks! <br /><br />Next step: acquire knowledge on how to extract oxycodone from orchids... without wasps.

				The paper cites 10 university institutes and they tested the nectar from several orchids using gas chromatography mass spectrometry so there isn&#039;t really anything to argue about...&nbsp; They also contain ethanol lol.<br /><br />They also put the nectar in capillary tubes near the orchids to see if the nectar attracted the insects and yes it did.&nbsp; It seems like those pollinators and vectors like getting fucked up.

I am trying to save some poor dumb bastard that thinks if they just get this orchid and drink the nectar they will get a buzz like that of oxycodone. More than likely they will destroy their renal system and possible go blind, if they don&#039;t just die from toxicity. But there again is the thinning of the heard, eh?&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How does the chemical compound that I got from a google search prove anything to do with this paper published by a respected institute?&nbsp; They worked on this for years.&nbsp; You would see that if you read the paper. ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />OK, I will agree to disagree with you, but only because I do enjoy reading most all of your posts. I do however have concern for those that lead people to the fore gone conclusion that if you read a paper or have partial information on a subject you can make statements that are fundamentally WRONG!<br /><br />Basic Chemistry, when you change the bonds between molecules you are changing the outcome of said compound, regardless how similar that compound may look or act(keyword here) as another, it is still a completely different compound due to the bonding. Thus it will react differently.<br /><br />In this case there is much more different than just bonding. :o<br /><br />So regardless of what some paper says and how many years of research these so called scientists have they are merely publishing a paper on a very hot topic to pad their resume for future endeavors on someone else dime.&nbsp; :)
