				Find somebody on #bitcoin-otc IRC channel and trade with them for cash via Western Union or some other method. They also sell moneypak recharge, so you can apply to a greendot card and withdraw cash. http://bitcoin-otc.com/<br /><br />Use all those bitcoin near you sites to find people to exchange with for cash, or find somebody on bitcointalk.org in your area<br />Get a card from OkPAY or Aurumxchange and then they&#039;ll load it directly and you can withdraw. Typically you can sell on MtGox, then just withdraw in MtGox pincodes and give it to exchangers for WU or whatever. Beware of getting goxxed for ID scans tho<br /><br />

				Yeah, this one changes weekly, it seems.&nbsp; When TradeHill fell apart, and bitinstant was &#039;noncomunicado&#039; for about a week, I finally opened an okpay account, and had my money sent there, and just last week it seems, okpay started allowing btc to be sent there and transferred also...but I warn you, to get full privileges at okpay they sure want a lot of info, including bank statements and shit, to prove identity, and I don&#039;t like that...<br /><br />Now, in spite of past scammers, I trust the inhouse btc people more than the outside, tho I&#039;ve used them in the opposite direction: changing dollars to btc., but both btc buddy and btc King did me right, and several people I trust have had good luck with Sugar Mama, so I&#039;d see if one of those three works.<br /><br />I&#039;d read over the &#039;security&#039; thread, and see what you think....used to go with get-bitcoin.com, before that with exchangebitcoin: they were good, there&#039;s been a few problems with get-bitcoin.com, but I guess they are alright....<br /><br />Here, see: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14083.msg138579#msg138579<br /><br />AS far as &#039;secure&#039; goes, I&#039;m not sure there is any, not after what happened with tradehill.&nbsp; I know it *seems* more trustworthy if they have a website and want id and all, but damn if I know....

				Get-bitcoin.com will get you bitcoin in 24 hours if you do a cash deposit at chase or bank of America and charge a 5% fee. That&#039;s cheap and fast compared to the 15+% that the MP to BC venders on SR charge. I personally use dwolla to mtgox which takes about a week but only charges about 1.5%. I use them because I always deposit $1000+ at a time and the extra couple days wait is worth the couple hounded dollars I was losing by going other routes. I use get-bitcoin for smaller orders or when I need bitcoin quickly and don&#039;t care about my percent loss.

				He s asking to get fiat with BTC not the other way around.<br /><br />No one here should be using gox unless you are just a casual buyer. They will eventually lock the account and require AML verification. Not only do they comply with all LE request (all exchanges most likely will) but they also go out of their way to help law enforcement agencies. <br /><br />You should limit BTC &gt; USD / EUR&nbsp; transactions at exchanges as much as possible as these are highly scrutinized. USD / EUR&gt; BTC is mostly ok in small amounts like 3 digits a month.&nbsp; If you had to use an exchange you should look for a small independent ones like get-bitcoin.com or spendbitcoin.com who likely don&#039;t keep the best of records or papertrail.&nbsp; <br /><br />Otherwise you should try to stick with p2p. bitcoin-otc was an excellent suggestion. You can also look on bitcointalk forums marketplace or make a post of your own. <br /><br />The best way to cash out big amounts is to save up a good amount of BTC then f2f trade USD for BTC on a laptop in a public place. Just make none of your online identities are linked so they have no idea who you could be then f2f isn&#039;t a problem.Pretty mu ch every other way, if you move big amounts, you could be easily caught (doesn&#039;t mean they will bother, but you&#039;re not safe.)

				As mentioned before: GetBitcon <br />5% Fee (cheap)<br />Anonymous: Cash deposit (Bank of America or Chase)<br />FAST: Guaranteed 24hr turnaround (normally within a couple hours!)<br />EASY: Place your order, deposit the cash (no ID required), send your receipt, then get high while you wait for them to come through :D

				I&#039;m not sure how the MP BTC vendors convert them to cash once they get the codes. My best guess is i know that MP isn&#039;t tied to a person, just buy a prepaid visa card &amp; activate the moneypak code on it &amp; there you go. You now have cash money &amp; send person that gave you code corresponding btc amount. Would this not be one of the easiest methods for cashing out btc via mp?
