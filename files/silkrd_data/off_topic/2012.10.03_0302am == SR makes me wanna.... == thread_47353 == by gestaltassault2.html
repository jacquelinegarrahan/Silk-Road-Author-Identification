				at first, I knew the way was open for everyone to see...I shared my knowledge with a very close few, whom I trusted with the very sacred aspect of what is a simple revolution in the eye of the beholder. Time will tell how I have learned to respect limits and thresholds that keep me yearning for insight that can only be gained from understanding self control. <br />I never graduated from academy, and haven&#039;t any paper to tie to the wall......Just the simple smile of a love which will never fade away....<br />Long live the Silk!
