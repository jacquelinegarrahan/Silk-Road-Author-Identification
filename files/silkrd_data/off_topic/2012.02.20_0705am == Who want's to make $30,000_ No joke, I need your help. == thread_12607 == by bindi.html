				Hey everyone, I have a special request that I hope someone here can help me out with.&nbsp; I have a large account tied up at a bitcoin exchange that is going out of business and another at the main btc exchange and they won&#039;t release the funds until I identify myself.&nbsp; There is no reason for them to be suspicious about the account, it is just that they are updating their compliance standards and have to collect info on people with large accounts.&nbsp; It is not worth it to me to be identified in connection with the accounts, but I thought maybe someone here might be willing to be my surrogate and make some good money.<br /><br />I would need a picture of your driver&#039;s license, a pic of you holding the license, a copy of a recent utility bill of yours, and a &quot;notarized and apostilled&quot; copy of a valid photo ID.&nbsp; I know this probably all sounds really shady, but in all likelihood your info would just sit in the exchange&#039;s records for a few years and never be seen.&nbsp; As soon as the accounts are verified, I will empty them and never access them again.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there is someone here that could really use $30k and wouldn&#039;t mind sticking their neck out a little.&nbsp; Once used, I would destroy your info and keep no copy of it (this is in my interest as I don&#039;t want to be connected).<br /><br />If you are willing to do this, please pm me asap.&nbsp; Please include the state/country your id is from.&nbsp; I hope someone can help.<br /><br />PS, please do not mention the name of the exchanges in this thread so it won&#039;t come up in searches of this forum.&nbsp; you should easily be able to figure out which ones I&#039;m talking about though.

				I would simply use your own information, get the bitcoins out and stop using that account.<br /><br />Most times sites like that will not even bother reporting you to DEA or anyone like that. They only ask the information from you when you do large amounts of cash so they can have plausible deniability to say they ID&#039;d you if anything ever did happen.<br /><br />So along as you don&#039;t get caught moving pounds of drugs and as long as they don&#039;t find history of the bitcoin site on your computer(after they find drugs), then you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Remember, it&#039;s not illegal to be a bitcoin trader.

				I&#039;ve posted a bounty in the title so hopefully that price point will attract someone.&nbsp; Even if it&#039;s not worth it to you for $30k, surly you know someone that it would make a huge difference for.

				Maybe this really is all legit, but I can&#039;t help but be reminded of my dear Nigerian friend, Dr. William Monroe.<br /><br />-------------<br />Good Day,<br /><br />My name is Dr William Monroe, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, here in London, England. One of our accounts, with holding balance of Â£15,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Nigeria.<br /><br />Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.<br /><br />I have decided to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. I therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after necessary processes have been followed.<br /><br />This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.<br /><br />On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Dr William Monroe Financial Analysis and Remittance Manager<br />

				I agree it is totally shady looking when you step back and look at it.&nbsp; random guy on a hidden service drug forum is waving a bunch of easy money around.&nbsp; Kinda screams scam, but I&#039;m open to suggestion for making the transaction work.&nbsp; We can use the Silk Road escrow system if you like, or any other reasonable measures you can think of.

				Oh come on people!!!! Do i have to remind you of the old saying &quot;If its sounds too good to be true,&nbsp; it probably is?&quot; Why on earth would anyone give you 30k dollars for just giving you an ID? If this was a true problem, Im sure he would get a false Id or someone that is close to him. <br /><br />I guarantee that he will eventually ask you for some money saying that he needs X amount to get it all out. Or its an identity theft scam... Use common sense people, please!!! This thread should be closed or deleted. Which I will do now!!!
