				So I got a package of H in the mail yesterday and went over to a friends house. Turns out his dope man lives next door. We went over there because I buy from this guy too, through my friend. Where I live though, no one has H, and most wont even try it. <br /><br />Anyway, the dope man is a 35 year old guy who lives at home with mom and step-dad. The mom had just gotten back from the pain doc, with her fresh scripts of 30mg roxies and xanax. I didnt have my wallet on me, so I told her I would give her 5 bucks next time I was over if she gave me a xanny, they were the blue footballs. She agreed and handed me a pill. I put it in my shirt pocket and a moment later my friend and I went back to his place to re-dose on H.<br /><br />I pulled the pill out of my pocket and&nbsp; put it in the spoon where my H was, I love shooting opiates and benzos together. I wasnt really paying attention, and the only reason I discovered it was a roxy, and not a xanny, was that it was&nbsp; a roxy V and it turned everything that lovely shade of aqua. So I went ahead and banged it. No way to give it back at that point. I got to say I liked the combo.<br /><br />Anyway, a moment later, the dopeman (the womans son) knocked on our door to explain that hey &quot;momma gave you the wrong pill, can I get it back?&quot; I showed him the spoon, and said it would be rather difficult.<br /><br />We went back over a few minutes later because they wanted to &quot;talk&quot; about it.<br /><br />Step-dad decided to handle the situation. We sat down and he said &quot;where is my money&quot; I told him that I left my wallet at my place before I came over, and that I told her that and the deal was I would give her $5 bucks when next I saw them. He then said &quot;where is my pill&quot; to which I responded by pointing at my arm.<br /><br />I asked him how much money he thought I owed him, he told me I owed him $35. I told him that I had a different opinion. He asked what I thought I owed. I told him that I dont feel I owe you anything, I made a deal for a xanax, and I had no use for a roxy since I had a phat sac of H. But I told him that I will give him 5 bucks next time I saw him, just to be cool, and that I felt that was fair.<br /><br />He then said it isn&#039;t about fair, that the pills sell for 35 or 40 bucks, and that I did one, I owe him one, or the money for it.<br /><br />I then told him that the mistake was his/his wifes and that I am not going to eat that fuck up, he is going to have to.<br /><br />So my plan is this. The dr visit cost under $300 (that is what they told me) and the pharmacy charged a little over $200 to fill 180 roxy 30&#039;s. Let&#039;s be generous and call that a total of $600. Take that figure and divide it by 180 (the number of pills) and the grand total is $3.33<br /><br />So that is what I think I should give the guy, what opinion do you folks have?

				You should just tell the guy to fuck off. At the end of the day like you said, you made the deal for the Xanax and the silly tart gave you an Oxy (or whatever it was). How is this your issue? It isn&#039;t. The issue is that she should have gone to Specsavers. <br /><br />Tell the guy if he wants to do business then they need to learn how to monitor their stock. Ain&#039;t your problem. If they don&#039;t like it, show them the iron fist.

				sounds like you are in a pickle. I wish I had a dealer that lived next door to me. I would go half with him just to shut them up and give him like 15 bucks for it. Just so they will shut up and it wont tarnish your rep with them in the future. Unless you dont give a fuck about them then screw em and pay the 5!

				Yeah, they have just about 3 dollars in each pill and sell them for 35 or 40.<br /><br />But shit, I cant blame them. Junkies around here dont have any option other than roxies, now that the Opana has be reformulated. Even at $40 for a roxy they sell out in just a few days. <br /><br />Some dumb shit called my friend while I was at his house yesterday. He was trying to find a roxy. I told my friend to tell him I would sell him a point of H for $20. A point of H is better than 2 roxies. The guy still had no interest. &quot;I wouldnt do heroin&quot; he said. He would just rather be dope sick apparently.

Thats what made me an addict. But yesterday was the first roxy I&#039;ve done since I found SR and got my first order of Heroin. I have no use for them now. <br /><br />It cost me $120 to get high on roxy one time. I can nearly get a gram of H on here for $120 and get high several times, and the high is much better and lasts much longer. <br /><br />Oddly enough, Heroin and Silk Road has saved me a bunch of money, and makes me use opiates less frequently. Now, if I could score good heroin from my neighbor (or even within 100 miles of here) I would use it a lot more. After trying H, roxies seem pointless.

				I&#039;m gonna have to agree with Limitless on this. Where does the guy get off trying to make you pay for a fuck-up that wasn&#039;t yours?<br /><br />Normally I&#039;d say that you should be diplomatic about this but the dude seems like a sour little cunt, so he doesn&#039;t get my usual sympathy points. Pay him the five bucks you had agreed on and be done with it.

				How about telling this guy to fuck off... <br /><br />Explain to him he is lucky you don&#039;t take all 180 pills from him.. His stupid cunt wife gave you the wrong god dam pill. You are lucky that her mistake did affect your high. <br /><br />In fact&nbsp; he owes you a Xanax pill still. <br /><br />And for your headache another Roxie. <br /><br />The fact their loser son came over first would bother the fuck out of me.

				The guy dont live next to me, he lives next to my friend. I am at my friends house every few days. All he knows about me is what I drive. But even the registration on my license plate reflects my old address, not my current one. He may know my first name also.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I think I have decided to give them $5 because they were cool enough to front me a xanax. But I will tell him that acceptance of the $5 concludes the deal and if they ever start shit (or refuse to deal to my friend) over it, that it might end badly for them.<br /><br />But neither my friend nor I really care about doing roxies anymore since we tried H. We both take a certain amount of money from our pay checks, what we used to buy roxies with, and now we buy bitcoins. Ha.&nbsp; <br /><br />By the way, the son&#039;s girlfriend has great tits. So not being able to go over there and stare at them anymore might be the biggest loss.&nbsp; 8)

				Armtrax don&#039;t bother saying anything like that to him unless he flexes. There will already be tension in the room when you go on, no point in escalating it before you have to. Just give him the $5, say to him that&#039;s all you are agreeing to and wait for it to play out. IF he decides to crank it up and try and ask you for more then you make sure you are clear that you wont and that it will be all there is to it and he needs to drop it. <br /><br />From there, IF he flexes just give him something to think about. Don&#039;t kick the fuck out of him, push his head into a wall nose first and keep it there for a sec. He will shit it and shut the fuck up. From there yoou just say &quot;This is where it ends, we are done now&quot; and walk out. <br /><br />That&#039;s all you need to do but ALWAYS let them be the first person to take it up a gear, don&#039;t do it yourself because you may not have to do that.

				I&#039;m at my buddy&#039;s house now. Going to be walking over there in a few. But yeah, sounds like a good idea, no need to raise the tension any if it isn&#039;t needed, glad you pointed that out.<br /><br />One thing that is different here than in the UK is that almost everyone has copious amounts of firearms. I don&#039;t think I will physically try to manhandle a dude in his own house, but I will make it clear that $5 is all he is going to get should he decide to manifest some sort of attitude.<br />

				Just pay that asshole the $5 you have already agreed to and forget the rest.&nbsp; Don&#039;t let his dumb ass push you around he or his wife fucked up and will have to eat it bottom line.<br /><br />On a side note you cannot inject xanax because it is not water soluble.&nbsp; Some of the binders and shit may dissolve in the water but when you draw up the xanax will be leftover in the spoon.&nbsp; If you really want to inject xanax you can use some everclear or some other alcohol that is a very high percent.<br /><br />Remember be safe.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />StuntBum

				i wish you the best of luck man.&nbsp; i too also carry, but i hope i never have to use it.&nbsp; if it comes to it, let the little fucker knock you around a bit before you pull your piece.&nbsp; then shoot him in the belly.&nbsp; nothing too vital is in the belly, and takes quite a while to bleed out.&nbsp; call 911 yourself, after he&#039;s gutshot.&nbsp; this will insure self defense.&nbsp; you&#039;ll have the bruises to prove you were attacked, and not aiming for vital organs, and calling his ambulance will show you didn&#039;t want him to die.&nbsp; self defense will be clear cut.&nbsp; the only issue may be why you had the firearm.&nbsp; but, that depends on the state. mine allows open carry.&nbsp; meaning if it is on your hip in plain sight, it&#039;s kosher.

Mine is Ex MOD so it is basically a tank minus the guns and military upgrades. Resists grenades and landmines though so good times. <br /><br />Anyway, if you are interested in some ballistic armour just let me know. All my armour is brand new so you wouldn&#039;t be getting anything that had had anything fired into it previously. Buy them direct from manufacturer. :) I have the covert model that is combined ballistic/stab proof. Dead comfy.

If you wanted them upgraded to NIJ IV then that&#039;s not an issue. You are really better off getting the covert vest though because it provides more comprehensive cover to your torso.

				kapp, my bunker idea would be at least 200 feet under ground.&nbsp; 2 feet of concrete walls, ceiling, and floor, with 6 inches of lead between the concrete, to keep out radiation.&nbsp; it would be 100 yards by 100 yards in size.&nbsp; one half would be for growing plants.&nbsp; food, small trees, herbs, ect.&nbsp; this would eliminate the need for air filters, to bring in contaminated air.&nbsp; the plants would put off enough oxygen to support me, and one other person.&nbsp; i would have it near a river, with a turbine style generator, and possibly a windmill generator.&nbsp; if we block out the sun with all of the fallout, solar panels would be a waste of money.&nbsp; another good size chunk would be to store dried goods, such as pasta and rice, and canned goods.&nbsp; not to mention lots and lots of distilled water.&nbsp; the radiation contaminated river can turn my turbine, to provide the light to keep my plants growing, but i don&#039;t want to filter it to drink or give to my plants.&nbsp; only a small quarter would be used as my actual living space.&nbsp; might keep a tv, laptop, and old xbox, just to keep from losing my mind.&nbsp; having ammo stored is a plus of course, but a bunker of this size, and these plans, should theoretically hold up two people up to 5 years.&nbsp; 10 if you manage your crops and water properly.&nbsp; <br /><br />so, yeah, not very affordable at this point.&nbsp; it&#039;s my dream at this point.&nbsp; but who knows, 5 years from now, i might be able to start construction.
