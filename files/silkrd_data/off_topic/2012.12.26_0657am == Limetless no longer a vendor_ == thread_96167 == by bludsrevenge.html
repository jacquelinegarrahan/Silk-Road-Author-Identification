				Yeah, it seems out of place in that thread<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30938.msg682432#msg682432<br /><br />Only thing I can put together is it had the newest comment in that section at the time (I posted minutes before, refreshed and saw hist post).

				My theory is that several people have independantly discovered a way to abuse the &quot;report vendor/item&quot; link into forcing a vendor to be suspended.

				I really think this report a vendor things needs to be taken away. It was a good idea, but obviously people aren&#039;t responsible enough to have it.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t I just make 50 accounts and methodically ban every vendor. Than I will have cornered the market. Also an easy tactic of anyone anti SR. LE could just start clicking that button until they are forced to take it away.

				God damn kids stop speculating. I posted around the link to the ticket thing because sales were slow but &quot;apparently&quot; I have been doing OOE sales which isn&#039;t true. I&#039;m waiting for a response from DPR about it now. coz this is some straight up shit.
