				I think i´ve been high on opium for like 3 days maybe 4, I didn&#039;t realize it was Tuesday, just been processing orders and drinking opium tea. Not sure what day i started.&nbsp; I would say I´m very very high. Although I can´t tell anymore apart from it being really hard to see straight with both eyes open, oh and when I try to sleep like my mind plays me films, mostly about weird shit like monster munch packets fighting. But also occasionally something entertaining on wildlife.<br />I´m gonna try sleep again whilst the last batch of tea brews... someone had to test the potency of the tea before I send it to you guys.. stop judging, I can feel it. <br />

				Since I stopped smoking weed I only use psychedelics and alcohol...<br /><br />So unfortunately, I am usually sober. Once I start my career in the next year or two I will probably start smoking pot again, if my job allows me to do so. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere
