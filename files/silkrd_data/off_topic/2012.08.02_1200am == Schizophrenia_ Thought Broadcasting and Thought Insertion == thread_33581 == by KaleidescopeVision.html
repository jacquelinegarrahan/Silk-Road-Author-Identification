				Ill start off by saying I am writing about this because I have suffered from these symptoms of schizophrenia. I am curious to see opinions on these occurrences from the group of people that one would find on SR, rather than psychology forums found through google.<br /><br />I am sharing this today because of the certainty that I am not the only one who has experienced these among such a diverse drug culture. I was not high when I experienced these, and I am not formally diagnosed with any mental disorder.<br /><br />I would also like to say that I am not saying I am schizophrenic, or than anyone who experiences these is schizophrenic. I will now define the terms as seen in the medical dictionary.<br /><br />Though Broadcasting: &quot;a symptom of psychosis in which the patient believes that his or her thoughts are &quot;broadcast&quot; beyond the head so that other people can hear them. &quot;<br />My story of thought broadcasting: When i was sitting in the car on my way to the movies I was listening to my ipod. I was sitting in the back seat while the driver and passenger were listening to the radio. I continually felt as if I could not keep my mouth shut and as if I were speaking what was on my mind. It was especially concerning as it was of illegal nature, and would have been inappropriate for the others to hear. I continually took my headphones out to make sure I was not speaking, and I was perpetually uncertain as to whether my mouth was speaking or I was simply thinking. <br /><br />Thought Insertion: &quot;A schizophrenic delusion in which the patient believes in or acts on hallucinated external voices&quot;<br />My story of thought insertion: I had what felt like a mental battle with someone who was unhappy with what I had given them for a price. However, this happened a day after it occurred and absolutely nowhere near the individual. I experienced alien thoughts in my head rationalizing why he must be re compensated that overpowered my thoughts that argued that he was full of crap. I felt his thoughts overpower mine and then I was more than happy to re compensate him. I lost said battle.<br /><br />
