				If they&#039;re blotters, wrap the in foil, stick them in the fridge. <br />If they get hot and touch plastic it will stick and weaken the dose.

				I&#039;ve always felt throwing drugs in the fridge for storage was unnecessary. Unless you live in a very, very humid and hot area, then you should be fine wrapping the blotters up in foil, putting that in a plastic bag, then putting that in a mason jar or something similar. I have kept Acid like this for over a year with no noticeable decrease in potency whatsoever.<br /><br />However:<br /><br />The 2C&#039;s are NOWHERE near as unstable as LSD is. I kept my 2C&#039;s in the bags they came in between a book and that was it. If they were synthesized right and have no impurities, then I see absolutely no reason why any of the (common) 2C&#039;s would decompose at all over time.

				I store mine either in my mouth or wrapped in foil, stuffed in a plastic or paper bag, which is stuffed in a velvet bag with a drawstring, which is placed in a box along with the rest of my drug collection. I love opening my special box....so many goodies await me inside. :P
