				I ordered from a new vendor, who apparently is out of product. I received a message from him saying he ran into issues because his friend was in jail but is sending orders out Monday and offered to cancel if I wanted.<br /><br />Should I be worried? If this friend was &quot;locked up&quot; for selling drugs ... should I cancel and not have this vendor send drugs to my address or am I just being paranoid? It seems really sketchy to me, but I am a paranoid person. I thought I would check for other opinions.. <br />It would be sent priority anyway so it&#039;s not like they could do a controlled delivery but still not sure what to think, I don&#039;t want my address on a watch list or anything.<br /><br />Thanks for any clear-headed answers.

				Nah dude,the cops wouldn&#039;t let him operate if they know he&#039;s selling .&nbsp; So he would&#039;ve got nabbed by now. <br /><br />If he follows the vendor rules then you have nothing to worry about. <br /><br />I prefer old time vendors with lots of experience.&nbsp; It&#039;s worth the extra cost for reliability. <br /><br />Saving a few bucks and letting some teenager sell you drugs is always a bad choice.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a vendor who&#039;s stealth is so damn good , he hides it [PACKAGING DETAILS REMOVED] !!&nbsp; So it just looks like a product you ordered.&nbsp; Totally gets past customs.&nbsp; &nbsp;That extra mile counts&nbsp; &nbsp;[PACKAGING DETAILS REMOVED]

				Hey Jedi, I&#039;m not trying to sound like a prick or anything, but I think that its generally bad practice to out vendors specific methods of stealth packaging. Not saying that you told a state secret or anything.. just something to be mindful of on here.<br />Idk, sorry if I&#039;m being a paranoid asshole&nbsp; :o <br /><br />As for you H, I&#039;m totally with the jedi on this one.

Not many choices.<br />I was just worried that his friend would get out of jail on a plea and then possibly have told them about this friend, the SR vendor, who would cop a plea and then the police would investigate SR and take down any addresses this guy has and then talk to those people.. haha At least I&#039;m not just paranoid about drugs it&#039;s everything.<br /><br />Thanks

				Just my $.02, I&#039;d cancel till this blows over. Pending order means your vendor still has your address. If his situation is not certain, I&#039;d rather not have him holding on to it while shit gets sorted, you know? Should be encrypted, obviously, but you don&#039;t know his operation. No established trust as of yet. <br /><br />That said, I get the observation about limited vendors for your product, something I note whenever people wax poetic about finding ideal vendors. There often aren&#039;t any. I&#039;m not saying never. But I&#039;d let him ship more product to other people, first, once he gets re-connected. How well can your vendor trust his friend? You don&#039;t know.

				guys, please do not post specific details about any vendor&#039;s stealth packaging techniques.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can understand how this is dangerous to do considering the LE presence in the forums.

				One more thing...<br />Just because someone sends a parcel &quot;priority&quot; doesn&#039;t mean LE cannot do a controlled delivery.<br />They can do it on any parcel, USPS, DHL, UPS, FedEx, it doesn&#039;t matter the shipping company or the method of shipping used.<br />Don&#039;t think there is some magic to priority, it&#039;s fast, but mail is mail.

				Thanks. I ended up not cancelling and I believe I made a mistake, but nothing I can do now. <br />I got it, but ... me and everyone else pretty much got ripped off.
