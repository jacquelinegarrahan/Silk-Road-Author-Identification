				&quot;...Once you have completed 35 successful transactions and have been a seller for at least one month, you may ask your customers to finalize early without reprocussion...&quot;.<br /><br />Maybe this helps a little bit to understand why it is not very probable that vendors scam customers.<br />The rules make sure that ONLY vendors are allowed to ask for FINALIZING EARLY which have build already a good reputation and have been a vendor for at least 1 month!<br />That also means that vendors with less than 35 successful transactions and or being a seller for less than&nbsp; 1 month are NOT ALLOWED to ask for it!<br /><br />At least it is the buyers decision if he has trust into a vendor or not. ;)<br /><br />But every buyer should be alarmed if a vendor violate against the above mentioned rule out of Silk Road´s &quot;Seller´s Guide&quot;.<br />I ask all my new customers and customers outside of germany&nbsp; to finalize early with NO PROBLEMS.<br />If you have any doubts in finanlizing early, please have a look into my given feedback and you will see NO ONE COMPLAINING :D

				I understand that vendors have capital tied up in escrow but then you see vendors like ObamaGirl who, by their own doing or actually sending out product, had good reviews and a forum presence. Here over a month and then run off with people&#039;s money. A vendor can also get busted and if you have finalized early, tough shit. It can happen to anyone, they don&#039;t have to be trying to scam.

				That´s what I said...<br />You can not be sure a 100% even in this illegal business but you can have a 100% certainty.<br /><br />If you are going to buy something on ebay you can have the same problems with a vendor.<br />Also with commercial vendors. That´s why I think that this discussion about it is absolutely<br />needless.
