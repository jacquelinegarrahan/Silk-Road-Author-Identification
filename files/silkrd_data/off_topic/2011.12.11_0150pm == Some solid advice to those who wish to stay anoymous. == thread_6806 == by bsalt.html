				My advice to others (especially vendors) is do not use the same name on here that you will use other places. I just found a vendor here that is posting to another forum asking about items specific to what they sell. Coincidence perhaps but I find it unlikely. So the name you use here and on SR main page do not use on other forums.&nbsp; (especially vendors!!) The questions he is asking can land him clandestine lab or manufacturing if the project got far enough and tie him to here and you have sales. Bang 20 years in a nice online package.

				If you are trying to source somewhere and resell, yes - that is the craziest thing you could possibly do.&nbsp; I&#039;m on multiple sites under the same name but that&#039;s only because I am a seller - never a buyer - on all of them.&nbsp; I&#039;m so paranoid about my location I don&#039;t even ship from my own city and I use my work commute to drop mail over an hour away from where I live twice a week.&nbsp; Nobody is getting my address, other than the region that i live, which is larger than most countries in EU.<br /><br />Handing a bunch of people your address on a different online drug site then coming over here and selling is a bit loose-cannon on your security.&nbsp; The online drug community isn&#039;t exactly vast when stacked up against traditional online communities, and there are Le everywhere.&nbsp; be smart people!

				Not as a seller but as a user asking about extraction tek&#039;s. I just would think if LE is watching lots of boards and I am sure they are they would love to prioritize by who can catch the most charges.
