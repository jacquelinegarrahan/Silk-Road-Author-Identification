				So normally it you would just use a heated plate (One sitting on a stove on low heat is good)<br /><br />but what do you do if you want to rack up a bit somewhere without access to something like this? has anyone come across this problem?

				Years ago after I got a new car, I went back to the old one to clean up up for sale and I found a quarter. It was in the summer heat of a car for a few weeks and it was really soft and sticky. I tried everything to dry it out but there must&#039;ve been some cut in it that would keep me from fixing it.<br /><br />I had to find someone to cook it instead of me enjoying it myself.<br /><br />Try putting it in a dry place with some desiccant. <br />All I had was rice and silicone packs from vitamin bottles. It helps but it didn&#039;t work for me that time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sorry I don&#039;t have a solution for you.<br />

				I once had some GHB that was fairly wet.&nbsp; GHB is very hygroscopic.&nbsp; I put it in a small bottle with a desicant that got out of an over the counter pharmaceutical, omeprazole, actually.&nbsp; It completely dried the GHB within a few hours.
