				What is everyone&#039;s opinion on Tramadol? How would you compare it to other opiates, most notably codeine. What&#039;s a good recreational dose for an opiate virgin, what other drugs go well with it, etc. On erowid all of the drug experiences are like reading short novels, which I don&#039;t really feel like doing, and they all give conflicting opinions. I take it you guys would know the most on this, so please enlighten me!

				First of all, Tramadol is just as dangerous as percocet or vicodin as far as potential addictiveness.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never been addicted to it, but i&#039;ve heard some horror stories (people taking upwards of 30 pills per day).<br /><br />I&#039;ve never really mixed it with anything other than alcohol.&nbsp; For me, alcohol doesn&#039;t really enhance it the way it does for other opiates, i can have a few beers and not really notice much of a difference.<br /><br />Normally, for recreational purposes i take about 3 or 4 (50mg).&nbsp; I actually like Tramadol better than percocets or vicodin for a couple reasons.&nbsp; First of all it&#039;s cheaper.&nbsp; Second, the buzz lasts a lot longer.&nbsp; Typically i get a good buzz for about 8 hours from tramadol, whereas percs/vics i get about 4.&nbsp; Another thing about tramadol is that for me, it gives me a lot more energy than other opiates and i&#039;m just generally a lot more productive and happy.&nbsp; Pretty sure Tramadol also works as a very short acting SSRI, which may explain the glee i get from it.<br /><br />One oddity about tramadol vs other opiates is that for some reason, it sometimes causes lymph nodes in my neck and behind my ear to swell a bit.<br /><br />Just be careful, there is a lot of potential for addiction, and tramadol withdrawals are supposedly worse than typical opiates<br /><br />(sorry if this was like reading a short novel!)

				I&#039;ve been addicted to Tramadol as well as other stronger opiates, and Tramadol detox is nothing to fuck with. I was only taking about 10-12 pills a day, but it was over the course of about 2 years with no breaks. It&#039;s all of the shittiness of normal opiate withdrawal accompanied by SSRI withdrawal. Fucking brain zaps constantly. It does seem to last a lot longer than other traditional opiates as booringflooring said so that&#039;s a plus I guess. Just don&#039;t underestimate the addictiveness of the drug because it&#039;s not perceived as a strong opiate. Also be careful taking large doses with no tolerance because Tramadol is known to cause seizures in some people even if they have no prior history.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Love/hate relationship here. From everything I&#039;ve read (and please, correct me if I&#039;m wrong) it does not show up on standard drug tests. It is easier to get without acetaminophen. It lasts much longer and is generally more energizing. I can see where a lot of people would like this a lot. <br /><br />It&#039;s just not as much fun IMO. <br /><br />I used it on and off while quitting percocet, and for that purpose I found it very helpful. I still take some every now and then, it&#039;s just not the same as your classic opiate prescriptions. I find myself much more restless and itchy along with seeming more obviously intoxicated. Also, though it is less addicting to me personally, there seems to be a decent population for which this is not true. <br /><br />If you aren&#039;t dying to try it, I wouldn&#039;t suggest starting.

				I did try, but I think the SSRI&#039;s I&#039;m taking are blocking all of the effects. Yesterday I took 600mg, after the week before trying 200 and 300, and still felt nothing like the previous times. I&#039;m trying to push these so I just want to know if there is any value in them at all, but it seems impossible for me to tell.

				I was addicted to tramadol for 3 years. 18 pills (50 mg). Every fucking day. To give you an idea of how addictive it is, consider the following:<br /><br />I was coming off of a daily Vicodin and Xanax habit that was extremely expensive. After unsuccessfully trying to quit several times, I began purchasing the 180 packs of tramadol online because I thought I would be able to replace my addiction and then wean off the tramadol. I was right about replacing the addiction. And while tramadol is cheaper, I felt much sicker when I would miss a dose. Heroin sick, even. The migraines from attempting to quit were legendary. Sometimes, the headaches would last for several days, during which I was unable to sleep and began getting delirious. My weight would drop 10-15 pounds because of the constant fever and inability to eat. The withdrawals are longer than most opiates. <br /><br />And the best part about tramadol: after you have gotten to the point where you can&#039;t stop taking it, dosing will start to make you ill. And then you&#039;re trapped between that kind of sickness and the sickness from withdrawals.<br /><br />A long, long time ago, when I was in high school, tramadol got me really, really high and happy. But it fucks with your serotonin, and your brain/body chemistry changes over time. It really will make you crazy and a cracked out shell. Stick with the good stuff - Vicodin, etc., because while it may be &quot;harder&quot; according to general opinion, at least it will not leave you completely whacked out. Being addicted to tramadol puts you in the same emotional category as someone who rolls too much.

				Also a lot of doctors will tell you that it&#039;s non addictive which is the biggest bullshit that I&#039;ve ever heard in my entire life. I got Tramadol instead of hydro cause I&#039;m so young, and there&#039;s &quot;no chance for addiction or withdrawal&quot; according to my ex doc. Don&#039;t let them fool you. Most don&#039;t know what the fuck they&#039;re talking about.

				I take 2 tramadol 50mg tablets when I have a headache or other ache in my body. Personally, I like them for my aches and pains, but I can&#039;t even imagine taking 10 or more a day. I don&#039;t even take 2 a day. Needless to say, I&#039;ve never been addicted to opiates of any kind. I dunno, that&#039;s my 2 cents, probably not exactly helpful..

I actually wrote a post on SR forums the other day concerning the rare effervescent variety of Tramadol. It&#039;s the effervescent variety which got me liking the stuff. And I mean REALLY liking it. I obtained it on private prescription from an online pharmacy for pain relief, and prior to using it I had no experience with opiates and not much clue what to expect. I was pretty naive I must say.<br /><br />Anyway I took one of them (50mg) in a glass of water and it fizzed and hissed and tasted like a wonderful glass of lemonade. Within maybe 5 or 10 minutes I started feeling something very very nice...a pleasurable euphoria moving up my spine and a warmth and light feeling spreading out over my body. It kept on building and building until I felt so wonderful and in a daze.. really loved up and comfortable both emotionally and physically. I imagined this is how heroin must feel. All my problems just vanished and I felt at peace and one with the world. <br /><br />I started using it daily, my magic lemonade drink became a breakfast routine. The strange thing was, as much as it gave euphoria and the intense physical and emotion comfort, it also gave me loads of energy. I had become a bit withdrawn and wasn&#039;t going out much, but on Tramadol I just wanted to be outside and among people... I started exercising and went for long walks and rides into the countryside and was happy to see people. Nothing felt threatening and it was as though nothing could bother or worry me. The exercising was great too because I would never feel tired and felt my strength and stamina was almost super human as I got fitter and fitter! I could run 4km and then do 40 minutes heavy weights and not feel tired..it just seem to add to the Tramadol buzz. <br /><br />I had a very very good summer on those effervescents..probably the best in my life. It&#039;s a strange thing about Tramadol...it seemed like the perfect drug. Not just one drug, but three drugs.. a narcotic opiate, an antidepressant and amphetamine. All rolled into one. I swear there were times I was out in the summery countryside where I felt like I was tripping on MDMA or something..just sooo loved up with nature and seeing the beauty all around me in everything and everyone. <br /><br />For me it was nothing short of a miracle. It solved all my emotional hangups and health problems. But like all good things, it had to come to an end.. my supply dried up and I was forced to try regular tablets and capsules... to my dismay, they did not work the same as the effervescent tablets.. the magic was not there, and they seemed to have too much simulation for me which made me anxious. I tried all kinds of brands and different types of Tramadol over the next year, including Tramadol Melts that melt on the tongue...but nothing came close to those effervescents.. I still to this day don&#039;t know if it was the combination of extra ingredients in them, or just the fact I wasn&#039;t used to Tramadol and maybe had developed an aversion to Tramadol later on or something without realising. But the bad effects began to soon outweigh the positive effects so I simply lost interest in taking it. In fact, the pills started to cause me liver pain and I could tell it wasn&#039;t something I should keep doing. Strange thing is I never experienced any tolerance (never took more than 50mg) and never experienced any withdrawal symptoms when I stopped taking them, apart from a return to my usual lethargic and chronically fatigued self! <br /><br />So that&#039;s my story and love affair with Tramadol.

				I have tested tramadol 2 times. I was very confident in club enviroment with 50mg tramadol only.<br />Then I smoked very nice weed and ate 100mg&#039;s of tramadol and nodded and was very warm and could feel the euphoria in my spine.<br /><br />If you want occasional fun i guess they are good. Just remember to start off small 50-100mg depending on weight. Wouldn&#039;t recommend using them more than occasionally as they can be addictive.<br />

				I would just like to add from my experience...that Tramadol does not seem to be as addictive or tolerance forming as codeine and proper opiates because it&#039;s not a true opiate drug. However, there are cases of terrible withdrawal problems associated with it for people who take higher doses for extended periods, so be careful. I think many of these withdrawal problems are because of Tramadol&#039;s multiple (three-way) actions on the brain and it&#039;s like coming off a powerful anti-depressant drug which also can have very unpleasant and scary withdrawal unless you taper down gradually. <br /><br />One lasting and hard to shake side effect for me though is a psychological one... because the drug was just so fantastic for me in the beginning its become like a benchmark which I compare all other drugs too. And I also find myself missing that feeling on it and thinking that my life is not as good now. I have tried all kinds of opiates to replace it (poppy tea, kratom, codeine extraction etc) but nothing is quite as good. I guess I crave it and hope some day I will find the effervescent tablets again. That&#039;s the thing with narcotics and opiates...the psychological dependency can often be the hardest thing to get over and it can take years and years (if indeed you ever do). Just like some delicious cake you tasted and you yearn to taste it again. Maybe some things are just too good (like heroin) and you just don&#039;t want that memory ingrained in your brain.

After I moved I was on and off OCs, codiene, heroin, vicodin and what have you for a few years, managed to quit everything for a while then moved in with my brother who was still doing it all and was getting tramadol bottles off the interweb. <br /><br />Now i don&#039;t know if there is some difference in the different brands as dimitri suggested but when i started taking them again I got a bit more of a stimulant effect than i had previously (and i hate stimulants) and not nearly the same warm euphoria. And to those of you who are thinking, oh his tolerance just went up, i&#039;m actually currently very happily taking kratom every day and getting a good buzz on every 4-6g dose.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how different the different types are but- i&#039;ve had a love affair myself with them (that ironically ultimately broke up my real love relationship with my ex..) only to come back to them and much rather take kratom.<br /><br />So get some kratom! It&#039;s good for you!

				Wise words audacity, and interesting to read you had a similar experience to me with changing Tramadol pill.&nbsp; I too use Kratom now and find it a good substitute. It&#039;s not in the same league as my Tramadol experience but it&#039;s still a useful plant to work with. It seems to be far gentler on the body/liver and not toxic like Tramadol. I have tried 4 different strains of Kratom and its an interesting plant, each strain offers unique effects. The white vein variety is like a full-on physical opiate-style high.. but the red vein sumatra is much more subtle and cerebral for me..just one 400mg capsule does me and really perks me up and puts me in a motivated mood to work. Kratom does tend to make my anxiety worse though so its no good for me to take if I&#039;m going outside...but I sometimes counteract that with a low dose of benzo. <br /><br />I also take opium too from poppy tea occasionally..I can buy 500g of poppy pods for around £13/$20 so that&#039;s a good cheap alternative for codeine or morphine.. It can be quite stimulating though for me and can also cause bad nausea. Really screws up my digestive system too...so it&#039;s best taken with antihistamines or other drugs to reduce the nausea and gastric upset. I find around 15g of powdered dried poppy pod steeped in boiling water for 10 minutes gives me a full-on opiate buzz if drunk as cold tea with lemon juice and sugar. <br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m currently on Tramadol; prescribed 200 mg daily, with the option to take another 100 mg dose or two as needed for pain.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t get any sort of buzz off of it, although I did when I first started using it.&nbsp; I do get decent pain control (not total, but nothing I&#039;ve tried so far gives me total pain control).<br /><br />So I have minimal experience using it recreationally.&nbsp; Ironically, I&#039;d like to come off of it if I can - the primary reason I decided to get on SR and start poking around is to do some research on pot and buy some and see if I can find a strain that will give me the same (or better?) level of pain control so that I could stop taking the Tramadol.<br /><br />I know I&#039;m physically dependent on the shit - I start to get shaky, irritable, and nauseated if I forget to take them on time and I go 13-14 hours without - and if I&#039;m going to have to take something for the rest of my life to help deal with pain, I&#039;d rather use pot than opiates.&nbsp; Not that opiates can&#039;t be fun, but they&#039;d be more fun if I wasn&#039;t on them every damn day.&nbsp;

				Doc told me me good med for some bad for others and that he was experiencing patients going through varied experiences. Turns out for me its a great anti depressant. If you decide to use it.....spin the wheel. <br /><br />Im at 300mg a day and doing quite well. If for some strange reason that changes and I fhink I need more.....its time to quit. titrate for a month...and bye bye. Oh, also Ill get Doc to add a bit of effexor during coming off...and clonazepam I already have. <br /><br />just rememeber its effects everyone differently; gotta watch out for seretonin syndrome especially if you like dropping MDMA.

				Tramadol is stronger than codeine, no doubt. I prefer it over codeine because I&#039;m so much of an opiophile that for me to even get something from codeine I have to take heroic amounts (upwards of 400mg), and I don&#039;t really get euphoria at all- just dopesickness alleviation and a bad case of the itches.<br /><br />Tramadol takes me about as much (450mg-500mg) and I actually get a bit of feel-good from it. Definitely go with the Tramadol over codeine, but don&#039;t take much more mg of the tramadol than you do the codeine for your first dose. Because of this, I learned to stay away from weaker opiates such as hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol, and even oxycodone. But I&#039;m far from normal when it comes to tolerance<br /><br />DO NOT TAKE ANYWHERE NEAR MY DOSE UNLESS YOU&#039;RE A JUNKY, TOO ;). I am, unfortunately, a very seasoned opioid user and am currently on MMT (methadone maintenance treatment), Most NORMAL people that I know get a great buzz from 150-250 mg of tramadol, and I wish that I had never advanced past that threshold ;). <br /><br />But, for sure, it is a much better buzz than codeine. Not as strong as hydrocodone and probably not as euphoric, either, but still beter than codeine.<br />
