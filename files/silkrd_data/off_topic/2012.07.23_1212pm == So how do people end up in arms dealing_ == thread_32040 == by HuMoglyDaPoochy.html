				Have you seen the movie Lord of War? It&#039;s worth watching. Also the biography of one of the biggest arms dealers, Viktor Bout provides some insight.<br /><br />I think people just sorta roll into it. For whatever reason, you have weapons available and you know people that would like to buy them. And then you just do the logistics and earn money.

				It&#039;s sort of like asking how does anyone end up doing anything. Some people just decide to walk down that path.

				Yes, I also think it&#039;s more or less the same as with other &quot;illegal&quot; wares, if you can get them and see that someone wants them, you try to fill that demand and earn something.

				Id imagine that they have a decent amount of cash at their disposal, find somewhere they can obtain weapons at a low cost and are able to set up a meeting with someone who is prepared to buy them at a premium.

				Usually its the same way someone becomes a drug dealer.They hang out with a guy that knows a guy that knows a guy.Then that guy says hes selling guns you take a look you think its cool he thinks he likes you he asks if you ever sold guns blah blah blah.You know how it goes right? They make you go through all kinds of bullshit to see if you can handle yourself,can you even fire a weapon,do you know anything about weapons,would you be willing to kill if need be,maybe even set you up in a situation where you have to kill or be killed just to test you because they don&#039;t want someone who caves easy working for them.Its like pretty much drug dealers except they sell weapons and its way more risky and its way more dangerous and they make a crazy amount of money.The gun runners tend to be more business like because they&#039;re conducting business and its very risky business.Very risky and very dangerous.And once you know where the stashes are and the names of the big dudes no ones going to let you leave and have a possibility of you snitching.Once you&#039;re in you&#039;re in til death. &quot;blood in,blood out&quot;
