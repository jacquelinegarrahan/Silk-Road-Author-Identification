				How do i get more sales?<br /><br />I&#039;m a mushroom vendor here, and i have great competitive prices, excellent customer service and i pay for shipping, but sales aren&#039;t what i originally hoped for. i&#039;m trying to get more, but i don&#039;t like mindlessly bumping my posts in the &quot;Product offers&quot; section. is there any way that i can increase the amount of Fans i have so that i can sell out more quickly?<br /><br />Anyone have any sound advice?

If you become known for exceptional stealth and well versed customer support people will flock to you.

A lot of customers will want to buy off you if you&#039;re cheap and selling quality product, but would rather go with what they know than risk getting ripped off. Fair enough. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, jokes aside, CannabisConsumer is absolutely correct. Even though the majority of customers don&#039;t use pgp, they will be alarmed at a vendor who doesn&#039;t provide the option. You need to be a stealth &amp; customer service oriented professional.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;A tried and true marketing tactic is dramatically dropping the price for a period, even to the extent of making a (small) loss. This can help you reach critical mass, a tipping point where enough customers now see you as there go to guy/girl that their repeated confidence in you reassures and attracts more and more customers. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;CannabisConsumer&#039;s appeal for patience and perseverance is fundamental. Most vendors peak, plateau, dip constantly. Establishing a loyal base should be an immediate aim. Treat good customers especially well, give them more attention, prioritise them. It doesn&#039;t need to be extra gear or discounts, just make them feel like you appreciate their business and the fact that they hand over their hard earned coin too you!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone else has prob got better ideas, best of luck, AB.
