				**edit: I&#039;m taking a break. Be back in a few months. Other members in this thread may be willing. If you need more or need it faster, try BlarghRawr&#039;s microloan service: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=40749.0 with interest though if you&#039;re in a pinch)**<br /><br />Hi everybody,<br />I&#039;ve noticed a lot of posts requesting miniscule amounts of bitcoins to complete an order. I feel for you. This has happened to me twice in the last couple weeks. I&#039;ll forget to add on shipping or forget the bitcoin vendors fee and end up just a couple cents short of what I need. And then to get enough, it requires more time and money (at least $5 instantly gone in fees and a minimum addition amount of $20 if you use bitinstant like me) and I really hate asking for a custom listing for something like this (and some vendors just won&#039;t do it or even respond to these requests).<br /><br />Since my unfortunate mistakes, I have a little extra money on here with no plans to buy for a while, so I think I&#039;ll offer some micro-loans(or just gifts if it&#039;s small enough or I forget). If you need a few cents because of a stupid mistake like the one&#039;s I have made, I&#039;ll consider helping you out.<br /><br />I am only offering around 0.05btc(currently) because there is really no way of enforcing the repayment of a loan this way (and I wouldn&#039;t be TOO heartbroken if I lost that much).<br />Please post a description of what happened (not just a post like &quot;btc plz lol&quot;) and what you need. You must have decent forum stats and it will help your case if I laugh or feel bad for you. Senior members may get special treatment and higher limits.<br /><br />I will blacklist users who repeatedly ask for gifts/loans without first paying back the last one.<br /><br />I would like it if loans given out are paid back (plus a tip if possible), but I&#039;m not going to enforce any sort of time limit or interest rate because if you&#039;re like me, you try to avoid adding bitcoins as much as possible, sometimes months between deposits. Other than that I&#039;m not going to keep logs or anything.<br /><br />If you want to do the same through this thread, please just respond to the requester&#039;s post asap to reduce confusion and let others know you&#039;re doing it.<br />I think the best way would be to do it through the SR username so people knows who helped &#039;em out.<br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT PRIVATE MESSAGE ME FOR THIS, just do it here or on off-topic. If I have an order coming, I&#039;m usually on SR quite a bit and will respond fairly quickly, but if not, I may not log on for days/weeks.<br /><br />If this goes well, I might up the amount a bit. If it doesn&#039;t go well or is ignored, I&#039;ll delete this and pretend it never happened. It would be nice if we formalized this a little more or had a sticky for it or something, but we&#039;ll see how it goes.<br /><br />The only way a site like this can continue is if it&#039;s run with honesty and integrity... even though... you know... drugs...

				First time I&#039;ve been able to check this since posting. Looks like it&#039;s doing ok!<br />Edited the first post and Subject a bit. If wanted, I&#039;ll add members who are willing to do this and their max amount to loan to the first post. Any other edits?<br />Hopefully lenders won&#039;t lose any money in the long run and maybe even make a little.&nbsp; 8)
