				Anyone buy anything else besides drugs here?&nbsp; Just curious since I read on a thread a while back about plausible deniability basically saying that not only drugs are sold on SR, there are many legitimate, legal items for sale on SR.&nbsp; Well lets hear it, what have you bought that here that is not illegal??

				Some dude is selling an instruction manual for tampering with ATM machines, so that when you withdraw, say, £5 from your account, a £20 note comes out but only £5 is deducted from your balance. Also I saw someone selling a magnet-type-thing that removed security tags from clothes in shops. I&#039;m kind of sceptical on both of them and am a bit broke at the moment so I don&#039;t have the money to buy stuff I don&#039;t even think will work but maybe in a few months I&#039;ll give them a go.

				HOFF! keen as a bean I am!<br /><br />Gotta go one day to Myers or David Jones or Armani Exchange and do a spree! <br /><br />on that note thought I&#039;ve always wondered. They do 2 things, one is they take off the security tag, but don&#039;t they also run the price tag over something at the coiunter?(I don&#039;t know what it is since it&#039;s ALWAYS covered EVERYWHERE) Does that have anything to do with the beep beep that goes off?

				Guys, the coupons on SR are easy to make. I make n use em all the time as the guy who originally made em would post them on /b/ for free and made several guides on how to make them yourself. Pretty annoying that people sell something that was originally intended to be free to all.
