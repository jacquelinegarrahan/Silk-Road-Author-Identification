I&#039;m going to shoot the most important off that come to mind.<br /><br />1. Decide if it will be a legally or illegally owned firearm...<br /><br />2. Decide if it is strictly for defense.<br /><br />3. Find what&#039;s comfortable for you, test a bunch of different cal. &amp; styles at the gun range. Se what fits you the best.<br /><br />4. .357 as you mentioned, typically with a snub nose is popular for self protection. However, I am fairly sure all guns jam, it is just a matter of how well of a quality it is and how it is maintained by the owner.<br /><br />5. I would suggest hollow points as ammunition.<br /><br />6. For strictly self defense I would suggest one of the following as they are easily hidden, reliable, and have significant takedown power.<br /><br />https://www.google.com/#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=1af70e12f74a2e98&amp;q=ruger+lc9<br /><br />https://www.google.com/search?q=ruger+lcr&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZLYPUomAOab12wXSooCwAw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=666<br />

				Just remember, if you get caught with narcotics and a weapon at the same time, you are screwed. Even if it a legally owned firearm. You will get an extra crime tacked on.

				There are so many guns and everyone has different tastes it&#039;s hard to say.<br /><br />I love 1911 pistols. Very reliable and a hell of a lot of knockdown power. Not high cap mags though. Only about 8 rounds per magazine.<br /><br />If you are looking for a pistol to conceal carry everyday I would suggest the Smith and Wesson M&amp;P Shield. Very reliable weapon and easily concealable. <br /><br />As for caliber, almost any well places bullet will stop a human attacker, so you can really get whatever you want, 9mm .40 cal, .45ACP, .38 special, .357, they will all get the job done. <br /><br />One important question you need to ask yourself when carrying a firearm is.... Are you capable of killing someone?<br /><br />If the answer is no, do not buy a firearm for self defense.<br /><br />You don&#039;t &quot;shoot to would&quot; if you need to discharge your firearm in self defense it should be to kill an attacked that is threatening your life. <br /><br />I hope I could help out.<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

They&#039;re pretty well regarded because they don&#039;t use the same loading/firing system as a spring-loaded clip-fed semi-automatic pistol. They&#039;re incredibly reliable for that reason, and of course you don&#039;t have to pick up shell casings should you wind up in a crime scene.<br /><br />Others have covered everything I would say, so I&#039;m just backing them up here. Be ready to spend &gt;$600USD to get your piece, depending on where you go for it.

				I personally hate revolvers. If you have to reload in a hurry, good luck with that. I myself love glocks. I have previously carried a glock in a past job (not a cop). It is also what I carry daily. Glock 26 might work perfect for you. And all the naysayers who claim a 9mm wont stop anyone has obviously never shot someone or seen someone shot with one. Its all about round selection and shot placement. For 9mm I recommend Winchester Ranger RA9B or RA9T. You wont find a better performing 9mm round. You should also take a concealed carry class if available. Lots of myths and rumors about what is legal and what is not. Best to take the course and find out the truth.

				I rather reload another 14 as opposed to 6. Not to mention the trigger pull is usually heavier on revolvers. Heavier trigger pull means more missed shots under pressure. Yes revolvers will shoot 6 rounds in a row usually without problems. But there is a good reason the majority of pd&#039;s use glocks. Higher capacity and probably the most reliable semi auto pistol out there. To each their own

				Don&#039;t forget the good ole 12 gauge shotty!&nbsp; In my humble opinion, those are superior for home defense.&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy to grab and shoot quick.&nbsp; If you&#039;re not a&nbsp; great shot - it doesn&#039;t matter.&nbsp; And those hardly ever jam.&nbsp; <br /><br />A revolver won&#039;t jam, but if you need to let off more than one shot fast to protect yourself you could be fucked if you miss on your first shot.&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to rer cock it after every shot.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a good shot using hollow point bullets in a 45 revolver can fuck someone up bad so the first shot should be good enough.&nbsp; It&#039;s also easy to find great used, affordable revolvers.&nbsp; Glocks are pricey and sometimes jam.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love my 45 revolver.&nbsp; Man who am I kidding - I love ALL my GUNS!

				First off revolvers CAN and DO jam, just less often. However revolvers are expensive, a cheap revolver (h&amp;r, Rohm or RG, and Llahma are the WORST) WILL probably let you down. Lastly revolvers are thick and heavy and therefore are more difficult to conceal. Not to mention that revolvers tend to have muzzle flip which makes follow up shots somewhat difficult.<br /><br />As far as autos go, DO NOT buy anything made by Pheonix, Jennings or Century Arms.<br />I would suggest any of the FEG or Polish 9mm makarov chambered pistols, the bullet it pretty powerful for the size, the guns are quite inexpensive and they are small and insanely reliable. The FEG makes multiple PPK clones that are better in every way than the original PPK. You could also look at a subcompact or compact glock, reliable as hell, comes in multiple calibers, and easy to find.

				In my experience I would/do carry a m1911A1 chambered in .45ACP with federal hydrashok rounds. While shot placement is critical it becomes less so with this set up due to hydrostatic shock, although most people think they are capable of this when under fire it becomes difficult to achieve unless adequately trained.

Anything less for a 1911 will be a rust bucket and not a good idea.<br /><br />The bests ammo for any weapon is usually Glaser blue tip, or Hornady XTP hollowpoints, I PROMISE you will not be disappointed.<br />
