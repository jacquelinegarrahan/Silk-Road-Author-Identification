				It scares me because it can be the most astonishing, powerful experience you can have (from what ive read on the subject). Kind of like how I really want to skydive but im shit scared of that too.<br /><br />Plus when I read &#039;The Spirit Molecule&#039;&nbsp; I read a trip report about a guy being raped by a crocodile for eternity or something. Fuck that.

				First off, boss name and quote in the sig. He absolutely demolishes Dembsky in that debate. One of the slickest guys of all time that&#039;s for sure<br /><br />And people are scared of DMT.. because its different to normal life. And we have trouble letting go. That&#039;s pretty much it

				I&#039;ve got a few friends who don&#039;t wanna smoke DMT. Which sounds kinda reasonable when i think about it, cus me and my other friends who have done it will talk about it. And from the sound of it, it sounds powerful and intense as fuck. Even though we always tell them it has a natural beauty to the intense &#039;fuckness&#039; they still dont want to.<br /><br />Hell, I still get pretty anxious when getting ready to smoke DMT. The fact that my consciousness knows its about to be blown away puts my brain on high alert. I&#039;m almost glad that happens though, it forces me to meditate before i do it, which i find helps me out.<br /><br />I&#039;ll just lay out some gem stones, burn some insence, maybe play a soft Dead song, and do deep breathing. While i&#039;m doing that, i go over in my head why im doing this, what is more than likely going to happen and that in the end, all will be well. <br /><br />Then.<br /><br />BLAST OFF

				Well I&#039;m not too sure about the gemstone nonsense, but the setting sounds about right. There is nothing to fear but your own mind. You control your trip, especially with DMT, it&#039; quit dependent upon you chilling out and &quot;letting your mind wander&quot;. Get 1 maybe 2 very good friends with experience in psychs, make sure there is nothing pressing in the background of your life, and set aside some time. If you go into the experience with the belief that it will be enriching, you will have a good time. Over thinking can kill ;)&nbsp; .<br /><br />There is nothing to fear.<br /><br />-Cheers

				it can be an overwhelming experience, the rapid onset and the sheer intensity of it tend to be frightening to most people. <br /><br />even a lot of very experienced DMT users have quite a bit of pre-flight anxiety. because you know the intensity that it can hit you with, and sometimes you can have quite an ass kicking from DMT, much like any other psychedelic but just a hell of a lot more intense.. but its short lived. <br /><br />the best thing you really can do it relax and try to accept what comes.

				Thanks for the feedback guys, much appreciated! Also, I was wondering if DMT is anything like my experiences with LSD, where I always got the feeling that I will &quot;forever be stuck in this new reality&quot; type feeling. <br /><br />@Kappacino thanks bro, yeah IMO Hitch demolished every one he debated but I could be a bit biased as I loved the man and his ideas.

				Before smoking, I&#039;m always scared shitless.

It&#039;s so amazing once I &#039;return&#039;, it feels like someone jump-started my brain because I immediately just start rambling on about the weirdest shit that surprises even me. One odd time returning my sister told me I was talking insanely fast, almost like I was on speed or coke, about That 70&#039;s Show as if I were in a trance. This was recently after watching every episode of every season on Netflix which blew me away how much I could relate to the show. It was like the show was about my life, I had similar friends, similar parents, pretty much the same experiences as the character Eric Forman was depicted as having in the series only not as exaggerated. It was eery to say the least. ;D Suffice to say, it seems as though your subconscious plays a much larger role than your consciousness. You&#039;ll definitely find answers, although they may not be the ones you seek. ;) You people are going to think I&#039;m so fucking weird after reading this...err weirder I guess. Oh well. ^-^

				Idk, marvelous things have happened to me on DMT, you don&#039;t even have to go to &quot;hyperspace&quot; to experience it&#039;s wonders. I can take a few hits, and get back to my computer.
