				I am an evolutionary psychologist. I think of reasons why masses of people do things the way they do, and how that effects the reproductive situation of that society. Today I will be reviewing the parapsychology of prohibition,&nbsp; and why it exists.<br /><br />1. The Prison Industrial Complex.<br /><br />This is pretty simple. Hundreds of thousands depend on enforcing laws to make their living. Policeman, judges, drug counselors, social workers, prison guards, DEA agents, and others all benefit when they have something to do. Making laws against substances that they &#039;know&#039; many will use gives them a reason to exist. They will rationalize that they are &#039;helping&#039; society, and many actually believe this, but this is a mechanism used to suppress their own guilt. This artificial sense of self-superiority which they think gives them a moral mandate is perhaps the greatest obstacle for us to overcome. A lot of them are also drug tested, and they resent this, so this seek to pull us down to their level. Cops are also trained to see secondary and tertiary effects from actions, and they see you putting money into dirty Mexican cartel hands when you buy that eighth of dank.&nbsp; Others, though, genuinely believe in their mission, misguided as it is. It&#039;s hard to change someones mind when the relevancy of the job they&#039;re been doing for twenty years is threatened with destruction.<br /><br />2. Alcohol-Tobacco Industry.<br /><br />Simple, again. These guys know their substances are ACTUALLY bad for your health. They don&#039;t want competition from all the safe, illegal drugs out there. Suddenly, the alcoholic who would rather take LSD once a month is no longer a regular in his favorite bar. Also, the government loves tax revenue from these things, and thinks it would lose on big money if suddenly everyone is growing weed in their closet instead of buying their $9.00 pack of cancer smokes. There is nothing inherently wrong with either alcohol or tobacco, but their industry has a vested interest in prohibition.<br /><br />3. Continuity.<br /><br />If the government ended prohibition, they would look very silly. Tens of thousands of people, both cops and users, have died. Millions worldwide are in jail. To pardon all those people it would be a bureaucratic nightmare. They also think that it would undermine the credibility of the government, and rightly so. The Fed can&#039;t just admit they were wrong for decades, because that would give them responsibility for all the devastation from the failing war on drugs. When drugs are used responsibly (ie don&#039;t take Lsd and then drive on the highway or don&#039;t smoke meth for 5 days straight, or don&#039;t spend all your money on Heroin) they are quite safe. Also, so goes the US, so goes the world, and when half the world&#039;s nations base their drug laws on DEA guidelines, to say lifting prohibition in the US would cause some disturbances is putting it lightly.<br /><br />4. Female Psychology.<br /><br />Believe it or not, females are more suitable than men to addictive things. They are walking organic factories. Subconsciously, if things like meth and heroin were legal, a lot of mothers may spend their money on those things instead of their children, or not have children at all, instead, choosing to devote their life to drugs. Males can also use drugs to entice females or keep them in relationships, and the collective &#039;government psychological entity&#039; wants to limit male power.<br /><br />5. Christianity.<br /><br />There is a strong meme here that pleasure=bad. Pleasure is something you get by &quot;going to church&quot; or &quot;experiencing god&#039;s love&quot;. Since we know that is a load of bullshit, these people really dislike the idea of a pill (vyvanase!) that could give them those feelings without putting any &#039;work&#039; into it. Many Christians are in a &#039;trance&#039; of sorts where they will instinctively suppress anything that threatens to &#039;displace&#039; their god and his worldview. Also, a lot of these guys have lots of children, which ties into number four a bit. Religion in general worships pain as being better than pleasure, so drugs that give you nothing but pleasure are seen as demonic. Also, especially in this age, religion is on the wane and so these people are strongly attracted to preserving their world view.<br /><br />6. Parents.<br /><br />Parents are worried that their children will discover drugs that lead them to question the world and their authority. Their child will in this process draw away from the parents and replace that with love of their substance of choice. Parents want their children to find mates, a job, and reproduce. They are scared that their children won&#039;t follow this path if they, say, smoke weed everyday, or something.<br /><br />7. Fear<br /><br />Fear of the unknown, fear of the darkness ahead. It takes courage to take that first tab of acid, or that first puff of marijuana. Millions of people are scared, and unwilling to try it, but at the same time they don&#039;t want others to &#039;get an advantage&#039; from the drugs they refuse to take. DEA propaganda and DARE nonsense really amp up the fear. Many still believe in 2012 that marijuana damages your health, and does all sorts of horrible things to your body, when in fact, THC kills cancer cells and opens up your airways.<br /><br />8. The Pharmaceutical Industry.<br /><br />These guys are smart. They know if you can grow a plant or synthesize a drug you won&#039;t be buying Zoloft or Ambien as much anymore. You can&#039;t patent a plant. You can&#039;t patent a drug people can make in their basement from tree bark (DMT). You can&#039;t patent the poppy plant. They are already trying to make a drug like Marinol that mimics THC&#039;s health benefits, and this actually has side effects and will cost you an arm and a leg.<br /><br />9. Dumbasses.<br /><br />There is always going to be that guy who smokes meth for a week straight, gets in a car on his forth day of hallucinations, and drives into the wall of McDonalds. These are rare, but devastating for our public relations. This gives the impression that the lawyer who smokes meth one night to finish his casework is as bad as the deadbeat who totaled his car because they like the same substance. There is also that toothless bum who holds the local foodmart because he needs his fix. I honestly believe that these problems would be mitigated by lifting prohibition, although it would have to enacted in a staggered, geographic manner. We all know that the lawyer with an IQ of 140 who likes to smoke speed every once in a while is a MUCH less threat compared to stupid people, but we can&#039;t exactly make laws only allowing smart, responsible people to use drugs.<br /><br />10. Government Psychology.<br /><br />Remember, the government isn&#039;t a person. It is millions of people. It is those millions of psyches that &#039;enact&#039; the &#039;will&#039; of that mass. They, like all of us, like power and money. They also like the idea of being able to arrest you if you &#039;step out of line&#039;, and tying this to pleasurable substances that millions enjoy is a great way to instill fear and obedience into the populace. A populace that fears authority and constant arrest is more pliable and controllable than one that has to pretend to obey pointless and silly laws. Also, politicians and these gov. employees are scared silly by former drug dealers and drug facilitators (like DPR) gaining wealth and public opinion, because they could actually become a new political force to contend with.

				Thanks for this thought-provoking&nbsp; post. However, many things in it make me doubt you&#039;re a scholar. There are some serious mistaken inferences and flawed reasoning, not counting bad pop psychology.

				Yeeees; when you say you are an evolutionary psychologist, is that a salaried position? I mean Ive read a lot of Dawkins, Dennet, Steven Pinker etc. but I don&#039;t think I could call myself an evolutionary psychologist. Little of your post refers to how&nbsp; particular human behaviours become widespread due to the fact they help genes for that behaviour pass to the next generation.<br />Also a couple of specifics: THC kills cancer cells and opens your airways? I realise cannabis is a fairly benign drug and should be made legal ( along with all other drugs) . But those hippies have been lying to you. You can cite the single small study that shows these effects, and I&#039;ll explain to you why it&#039;s worthless.<br />And you definitely definitely CAN patent a plant, or at least a plant extract. Both morphine and Heroin are brand names originally.<br />The reason drugs are illegal: there&#039;s no conspiracy; drugs can be harmful, but the Governments of the world have grossly mishandled the problem and now the media and dumb public wont let them back down.

				+1, thanked. Good post.<br /><br />Government is our collective name for the parts of people&#039;s minds which are fearful and ashamed. We desire to have a world safe from unknowns and to have things deleted from reality that cause too much uncertainty in life.

				A lot of this just sounds like some PopPsych you read out of Reader&#039;s Digest or some magazine from the grocery store checkout line. You need some sources mate.

				I&#039;m pretty sure most people who smoked a joint and had some sort of existential night realized a lot of these things in one night when they were 16.<br /><br />Great job. You&#039;re a genius.

				Just imagine what the world would be like if all drugs were legal. Looks a lot like the same world we already live in just with less prisons. Its utterly ridiculous how they keep throwing money at drug prohibition expecting to make a dent in the problem. Think of the receptors in the brain that naturally match to marijuana. Man cannot impose unnatural law on his fellow, man has the innate ability see that is in fact natural, and not only that, but already has a predisposition built into his very body.<br />So natural medicine is illegal, but one can be prescribed any number of side effect causing drugs based on these very natural things. But the government&#039;s mind fucked world view doesn&#039;t stop here. Look at what has been done to the financial systems over a period of time. Look what has been done to liberty, if you even openly want it you&#039;re labelled as some kind of freak at the least or terrorist at the worst. <br />I think a world with legal drugs would be a world with more responsible use of drugs. I think the best argument for getting pot legalized is abortion. LOL it&#039;s fucked up but think about it. So you can kill an unborn baby, but i can&#039;t smoke a joint? As a bumper sticker or t shirt.

				1. Retards want jobs<br /><br />They have no skills and the only job they can get is guarding people in prison cells, busting people with drugs via snitches, and regurgitating bullshit government propaganda. If they could not make money regurgitating propaganda, guarding people in cages or threatening to send people to prison for life if they don&#039;t give up information, they would starve to death. I blame the liberals for being so fixated on jobs that they think Slave Master is an acceptable position. <br /><br />2. Christians want you to love Jebus<br /><br />Jebus is the human-zombie-ghost hybrid form of the all mighty Sky Wizard who created you and drugs and decided to make you like the drugs that he created, but he totally hates it when you take the drugs that he created and forced you to take through his omnipotence, and he was nailed to a cross by a bunch of Jews to save you from your drug using sin but if you take drugs you might anger him and you don&#039;t like it when Jebus gets angry. I blame the Republicans for thinking they can force Jebus on the people through law. <br /><br />3. Psychopaths want money and power<br /><br />Politicians want power, alcohol and tobacco and pharmaceutical and rehab and construction and a billion other industries want to make money and the slave trade is a booming industry and infinite source of slaves! I blame psychopaths.<br /><br />4. The majority of people are so fucking retarded that they should be sent to special needs facilities <br /><br />They think if you smoke weed your dick will fall off
