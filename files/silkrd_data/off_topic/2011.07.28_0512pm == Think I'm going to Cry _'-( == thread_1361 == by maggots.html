				So I went to bed last night with a 100% positive feedback on 19 transactions and wake up to my score being a 88% :&#039;-(. Apparently one of my customers edited a past feedback down to 1/5 from 5/5 (I don&#039;t know why this small transaction compared to the other larger ones dropped it so much). The feedback has no comments, and they never tried to contact me about it. Kinda fucked up if you ask me. I PM&#039;d a few customers that I narrowed it down to be to simply ask them what was up with the intention of trying to fix whatever wrong they felt the need to give me a 1/5. Till I hear back, I&#039;m just gonna be sad........<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/7454

				That&#039;s disappointing! It would be much nicer if people would just be honest. How can they expect you to improve if they don&#039;t tell you what was wrong!<br /><br />By the way, I didn&#039;t know you could edit feedback! How can you do it? I&#039;d like to correct some bad feedback I left a seller who has since made it right :)

				stick it out maggot.<br />I wish Silk Road did not allow blank or &quot;Leave Feedback Here&quot; feedback text.<br />This has happened to some of our top vendors, ListenToTheMusic and envious among them. GreenCo&#039;s worst rating was also left blank. <br /><br />It may be a troll, or who knows. Start a forum thread, don&#039;t be too defensive. 1/5 is reserved for the very worst. Maybe it was a mistake and they will correct.<br /><br />And buyers read the reviews. A blank or anomalous feedback should be taken with a grain of salt, trolls about. Ask and learn about your vendor on the forum.

				nomad: thanks!!<br /><br />maggot: If I was looking at bad feedback for a seller and it was just blank I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much, or I would write to the seller and ask them if they could explain. I&#039;m sure it will work out after you get a few more transactions&nbsp; :)

				Even I think that SR operate under single person and it is hard to give a &quot;key of haven&quot; to somebody, feedback should be also moderated.

				Maybe you could encourage your buyers to visit the forums to leave feedback here (more detailed).<br />Then in your seller description you could link to the thread.
