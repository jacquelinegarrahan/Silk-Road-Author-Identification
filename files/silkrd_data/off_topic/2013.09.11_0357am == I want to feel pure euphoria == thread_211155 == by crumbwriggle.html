				What&#039;s the best drug to get an incredible euphoric feeling? I&#039;ve used all sorts of psychedelics, benzos, and cannabis but I&#039;ve never really dabbled in opiates. Opiates are supposedly the best way to achieve euphoria, but which one exactly?

				This might sound a bit strange but you need to get a really good ecstasy pill and put it in your bum, it&#039;s the only way.

				Idk, if the ecstasy NEEDS to go in your butt but it may help. I wouldn&#039;t say you should find a pill though. You should get MDA (or at least MDMA), regeant test it to make sure it&#039;s good, then snort a line. If that&#039;s not euphoria, I&#039;m done.

				Never dabbled in E because I&#039;m not one who can tolerate the crash.<br /><br />I have never felt more Euphoric than on opiates. Morphine is the best, imo.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re gonna get people saying opiates and E. E is more of a hyper Euphoria from what I can tell. Opiates are very lazy.

				No matter what you chose to do to go on your mini vaykay, be safe, first and foremost.

				Play lottery, and win. There you go, pure euphoria. ;)<br />You can not achieve that with MDMA. Not even 1%.<br /><br />I will try MDMA rectal now, I&#039;m such an anal freak but I never tried it, AussieMitch convinced my with his seemingly not so serious post, but hey he still managed to make me try it.<br /><br />Substance induced euphoria is nothing compared to brain generated euphoria. The brain is so much more powerful than any substance.

				Surroundings, people, will play a large part in the amount of euphoria you will feel. : )<br /><br />Please stay clear of opiates. <br /><br />MDMA/MDA is and has always been an amazing mix, can be very touchy feely and lots of euphoria. <br />I&#039;ve had great euphoria from just MDMA and 5-MEO_MIPT(Moxy)....just be very careful with your Moxy dose, 8mg-10mg is plenty. I&#039;ve had 14mg once, and was peaking for hours...great fun, but body load was intense....: )

				Yeah these people have the right idea, for &#039;euphoria&#039; euphoria, &#039;fucking buzzing i love you all so so much this is the best thing ever&#039;, you won&#039;t get better than good ol&#039; MDMA. Crack has a good initial rush but pretty soon you&#039;l be selling your spare kidney for &#039;just 1 more&#039; wee pipe<br /><br />Opiate euphoria is complex to explain and varies massively from person to person, and opiate to opiate. It depends on a lot of psychological factors, but for me, after a long hard day at work, to come back and shoot or some a bag.. that feeling is unbeatable, pure bliss, relaxed beyond words, wrapped in comfy warm hugs and nodding off, kinda like when you&#039;re on the edge of sleep whilst really tired but infinately more enjoyable.<br /><br />IV cokes meant to be great, i&#039;ll be trying that some point this week when my package arrives from &#039;ere, anyone had any exp with it?

				my fav is iv coke and h. just blissful when mixed. its hard to explain how great it is but its hard to find coke thats the right feeling to mix correctly. iv doesnt feel the same batchwise.<br /><br />Acid, Mushrooms, Mdma was a pretty mindblowing expierience very euphoric and all together negated any neg effects they might produce. <br /><br />
