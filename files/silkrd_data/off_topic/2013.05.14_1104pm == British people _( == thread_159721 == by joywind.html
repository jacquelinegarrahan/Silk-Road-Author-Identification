				I&#039;m like those Japanese female tourists who cry when they discover England isn&#039;t like they read in the Sherlock Holmes stories<br /><br />England since the War produces these Willy Wonka/Austin Powers/Elton John mutants who fuck kids and seem like their live on paint thinner, cotton candy, and poisonous mushrooms.<br /><br />I like England. I just don&#039;t like it that they became wannabe Americans and made Elton John their God Emperor.<br /><br />I liked the English and Scots back before they embraced realness. I liked them back when they were repressed and starchy. They&#039;re awful when they&#039;re real.<br /><br />&quot;Listen to my glass-cutting accent!! Isn&#039;t it just foookin&#039; brilliant????&quot;<br /><br />The worst thing about the Brits generally is they seem to all think they&#039;re sooooo fucking charming and loveable as they wallow in their own filth.

				England and Scotland were legitimately well-thought of about 50 or more years ago. Italians, South Americans, Spaniards etc thought the English and Scots had their act generally together and that it was worth imitating. Does anyone at all think that now? <br /><br />Even a Frenchman who thought England was a world centre of Judeo-Anglo-Masonic-Protestant troublemaking still had time for English suits and the rule of law in Britain. Who thinks things like that now?

				With the logic used by the OP you get:<br /><br />Americans - They all love guns, they&#039;re all fat, they enjoy MTV reality shows and all love listening to country.<br /><br />Australians - There is at least one kangaroo on every 10 squared metre of land, we all call prawns &quot;shrimp&quot;, everyone lives 5 minutes away from Ayres Rock and we all say &quot;mate&quot; constantly.<br /><br />Canadians-&nbsp; They all played a part in the making of &quot;Fargo&quot; and they all say &quot;eh?&quot;.<br /><br /><br />I assumed OP was trolling but I&#039;ve seen him say silly shit on several occasions so....
