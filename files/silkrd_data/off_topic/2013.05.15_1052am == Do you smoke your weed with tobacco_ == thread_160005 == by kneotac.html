				Yeah I do, both rolled and with a bong - not too much tobacco of course, can&#039;t handle weed straight just burns my throat. I think the yanks refer to straight weed as a joint and mixed with tobacco as a spliff.

				I think I originally started smoking with Tobacco as that was what was taught to me.....having said that, I much prefer the mildness of the tobacco/weed taste compared to weed alone...Also, I don&#039;t smoke cigarettes, just mixed with my buds.<br /><br />

				i was also wondering about this question&nbsp; :) Somewhere I&#039;ve heard that in the U.S its more common to smoke it without tobacco, and in the EU its common to smoke it with tobacco! <br /><br />I also started with tobacco and never tried it without. But only a little, like 30% tobacco and 70% weed!

				I do sometimes, as it is like doing a line of amphetamines/cola. I don&#039;t smoke tobacco, and I rarely roll spliffs, so when I do, I get super fucked up from the nicotine, and the cannabis intoxication takes on a completely different mood--nothing like smoking pure ganja. What I do not like is the nicotine withdrawals after a weekend of smoking spliffs. I get cranky, turning into a fucking grumpy little bitch. But the high is fantastic...

				indeed it is very common in EU to smoke with tobacco. personally i dont like pure spliffs, <br />well maybe the light outdoor weed is smokable.. indoor stuff makes me cough like crazy<br /><br />the main disadvantage to smoking pure is that you end up smoking A LOT more cause you need the nicotin fix too.. when i felt the craving for tobacco i didnt smoke a cig, joint tastes much better.. :-\<br />the same with bong hits, in the end ur gonna take the hits just for the nicotin rush<br /><br />atm im smoking only vapo and no tobacco at all, <br />therefore the amount of weed im smoking has decreased drastically!<br /><br />cheers minchia

I think the fact that we aussies punch whole cones each at a time is a fair reason in its own to smoke with tobacco......weed goes a bit further, but also burns better and sessions can last a little longer as we may be able to smoke 3 or 4 cones each instead of 1 or 2 I I personally LIKE smokjng a bong- the more the better!).

				Nope, I do smoke the odd cig but separately from weed. I like to take big hits of pot and the tobacco burns my throat too much and gives me an unpleasant head rush. I had a friend that used to mix tobacco into joints and give them to me without giving me the heads up, it always made me feel sick after taking a big pull on one.
