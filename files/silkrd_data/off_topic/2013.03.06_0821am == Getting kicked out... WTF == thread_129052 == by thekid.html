				That sucks no doubt, take solace though that things could be worse.. <br />My only real advice is to take care of your mother if you can, but don&#039;t allow her needs to derail your life. At the end of the day she made her decisions in the past, and those decisions played out in the present. Your parents have pretty selfishly just put YOUR life at a disadvantage and now you are having to deal with THEIR drama as well... and it sounds like that wears on you. <br />Your mother married the man. She made that choice. She should have known better. Period. Please take care of yourself as you are priority number one at this point, you can&#039;t help your mother in the long run if you don&#039;t brace yourself and keep your shit together. Don&#039;t become a victim of your weak parents. . <br />That being said... your father sounds like scum, If I was around I&#039;d gladly put his balls in his mouth for you (good times&nbsp; ;D). As a product of a multiple abusive fathers I know how strong that hate is, and feel free to hang on to that. Keep a cool head and sometime down the road your opportunity for final retribution will show itself. Trust me on that one&nbsp; ;)<br />Sorry if all this sounds harsh, I am just trying to give you some realistic advice from someone who has traveled these paths, and has seen things pull through and get better.

What is very enjoyable however is psychological torture. For example, you could send him death threats written in blood (fake but real looking blood. I don&#039;t recommend going to murder humans or animals or using your own) or mess with his personal belongings since you know where he lives and where he keeps all of it. Send messed up e-mails, call late at night and don&#039;t talk at all, send him disturbing pictures, this will eventually drive the guy into some kind of psychosis and paranoia. It is a lot more enjoyable than just killing a man, since you see him suffer for the longest time. Or of course you could kidnap him and inflict physical torture until he bleeds to death, It will be more fun for the time being but not as fun (long term) as psychological torture. I tend to think physical torture and punishment should only be inflicted on true scum of the earth. If you were to go that route, one of the best ways to truly physically torture someone is by finding a small cave somewhere, taking him there, taping him to a chair and leaving him there for two weeks. After few days of him being there, rats should start showing up and start eating him alive. Piece by piece. (Leaving raw meat near the chair would make the process even faster, since the raw meat would start decaying within a day or two). Of course there are more creative ways of killing a man, just something of off top of my head.<br /><br />~ Cooler

				I know it&#039;s a shit situation man, but honestly you should try your hardest to love both of your parents no matter what. My dad used to do all of those things to me and my mother, given he changed before he passed &amp; left a completely different person. But I felt the same hatred at points. Be better than him &amp; that. <br /><br />He probably has a drug addiction or has had one. Maybe he is going through some serious shit that is triggering this. All I know is at some points in my life I hated my father to the fullest, some points I loved him more than anything in the world. But in the end when he passed away I regretted ever thinking 1 bad thought about him. I would give anything to have my father back, even though he did what he did in the past. All I can offer is get on better terms with your father and let him know you love him even though what he has done to you, because if you don&#039;t and he passes away you will never have that opportunity again. I know I wish I would have taken time to tell my dad how much I loved him, instead of having anger towards him. Now I don&#039;t &amp; never will have the chance again. I do realize however we have completely different lives and situations!<br /><br />Hope your situation improves buddy!

I am providing for 2 girls now that my father is gone. It&#039;s the main reason why I come to SR. &amp; What you said is right.&nbsp; You need to stay clean, stay away from him when he&#039;s negative or hurting your family, stay in school, get a job, and make sure your mother will always live comfortably. Because the beauty about getting older is that when we were younger we had no control, now we control not only our future but our loved ones future. Then later down the road when you have your own children you can break the chain. You don&#039;t have to be like your old man. If you don&#039;t fuck up in America early on and can complete college or even HS, I can honestly say you can probably bank on a satisfactory lifestyle at the least! Just keep your head up man and try not to think on it too much! Your still young. I wish I didn&#039;t have the family issues I have at such a younger age either, but we do. Let&#039;s overcome bro.

				thanks guys! you guys are like a fam on here and i love it!! he is a very manipulative ass hole he turned me against my mom as a kid to make here a bad one, he also had a drug problem and still has one i caught him a few times in hotels not that long ago. its for the better now i have nothing to say to him or that i want to say to him. like i tell my girlfriend that ive been with for almost 3 years i dont want to be anything like him i want to be better and break the chain that is in the family on his side they are all ass holes and nothing but bunch of stealing, drunk no good people. they will lie straight to your face and think they are telling the truth sad that people are out there like this. but i hope i am one cool fuckin kick ass dad that you can come to for any help or want to talk to about anything and not get mad about it even if it was about drugs. i just want to be good livin with money and have a good head on my shoulders, and full time job. hopefully that comes soon. its hard to get a good job around here even if you have gone to college in this state kinda sucks but im in a private school for real estate though so hopefully this goes good for me and i also have a company that says they are waiting for a position to open up but its been about 2 months now. stay up guys! if i dont get back its because im in a hotel waiting to move into the new house should be soon! hopefully

I would like to maybe add at least 50 mg of mdpv into the mix... mainly because I want to see if the brain can even get anymore overloaded, and a kidnapping is as good a time as any for irresponsible experimentation. Permafried on 2c and mdpv... that would be fun to see&nbsp; :D

				The first thing I thought when I was reading that was.....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why are you living at home?&nbsp; Are you not 18?&nbsp; &nbsp; And if your not then why are you here?<br /><br />If your over 18 then disregard I suppose.&nbsp; &nbsp;And move out on your own?&nbsp; &nbsp;Life is going to suck, people are going to let you down,&nbsp; you learn to take it in stride or you stay miserable.<br /><br />Hating or being mad at anyone is a waste of energy.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are all human,&nbsp; you will hurt and piss off a lot of people in your time, and you will make very selfish choices for what you think is love.<br /><br />Such is life.&nbsp;
