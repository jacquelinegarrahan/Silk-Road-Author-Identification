				Hello Silk Roaders!<br /><br />So, I held a contest recently that gave away FREE COKE to the 3 funniest stories about what you folk have gotten up to while on cocaine.<br /><br />It made me laugh so much, I thought we could have a central thread for general story sharing of funny experiences we&#039;ve had on coke :)<br /><br />So come on in, post a story or two, and comment on the mishaps of others - but please keep things friendly!<br /><br />(To see the winning entries from the contest, visit this link and jump to page 4: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206104.0)<br /><br />Enjoy the party!<br /><br />Charles Floyd

				Too bad I can&#039;t find that girl that got gangbanged by a few pit bulls while wired to the gills. This girl usually has class and would never bang more than 1`dog at a time, and she usually makes them line up in an orderly fashion. This time, while wired, she let them all just jump in at the same time. <br />Dirty Dirty Girl. Almost makes me want to take back the engagement ring I gave her....,..almost.

				Here&#039;s a quick one : <br />A couple of years back I was working in another country, towards the end of the night I ran out of C and was looking for some more. Met this dealer in a club who said he had some nice shit I could buy. Ok lets check this out, went to the toilets and told him to have a line of his stuff first (didn&#039;t know the guy) which he took, let me sample and everything was good. We ended hanging out going from club to club which was fun until he started crying !!! I was like what the fuck, get your shit together. Sitting in the back of a taxi between clubs and the guy is crying his eyes out talking about how he was an intelligent person and didn&#039;t want to flip burgers for a living (where the fuck did that come from ?). He didn&#039;t want to sell drugs and was on a complete downer. I felt a bit sorry for the guy and told him to stay off drugs and stop dealing if this is what happens (great advice :P) and he could change his life if he wanted. <br />He ended up apologizing for his meltdown and decided to keep selling drugs.&nbsp;

				Considering I have never told anyone this story or even put it into words, here goes nothing.<br /><br />It was 2001 and I was young and very fearless...or fucking stupid, whatever you want to call it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was out at a bar one night by myself, just unwinding from the week and ran into a &quot;bar friend&quot; whom I hadn&#039;t seen in a while.&nbsp; He was there with a group of his buddies and they were celebrating his birthday.&nbsp; After many drinks, they invited me back to the house where the after party was happening.&nbsp; I agreed to go, not really knowing any of them outside of the bar scene.&nbsp; We got back to the house and I was promptly offered some blow.&nbsp; Of course, me being a regular user of drugs in general, I said sure.&nbsp; We all proceeded to get high as fuck and before I knew it, a mass orgy had ensued.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sometime the next morning after a night of drugs, sex and who the hell knows what else, I woke up in a tree, naked.&nbsp; Luckily for me, I had apparently undressed before climbing the tree so when I got down I didn&#039;t have to find my way back to my car in my birthday suit - my clothes were right there.&nbsp; I was not too far from the house because I found my car in about 15 minutes.&nbsp; As I reached my car, I saw a few police cruisers leaving the guys house, along with an ambulance.&nbsp; I have no idea what happened there considering I never saw any of those guys again, but I am guessing it wasn&#039;t good.&nbsp;
