				True story, these were the infamous words uttered to a dealer, the first time going to score some H.&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; It hadn&#039;t occured how fucked up that would sound after a few weeks of learning all the lingo, never thinking about how you would incorporate that word when it finally came down to it. Right after the words were spoke, the realization sank in of having walked right into that one, was humiliating. Strange but true, just one of the many amusing little trivial shits that come with all that.<br />So does anyone else have any amusing noob stories?<br />

				I don&#039;t really get what your trying to convey. Do you mean the guy told you he&#039;s looking for a little boy? And why were you humiliated?

				Who told you that was the correct lingo? Is it really called that in your area? I do feel you, that&#039;s a huge foot-in-mouth moment to be sure!<br />How did the dealer react?<br /><br />I remember all the drugs leaflets at school would give all the different street names for the drugs. Some of them where ridiculous, I don&#039;t know where they got their information from. Horse was one, in my area if you tried to by some &#039;Horse&#039; of a Heroin dealer you&#039;d be laughed off the street! Is there anywhere in the world they call H &#039;Horse&#039;?&nbsp;

				It&#039;s actually funny looking back on how green I was, eventually I gleamed the locals call it &quot;ferl&quot;, as in foil, as in the packages they wrap it in. So now you know you&#039;re in the south when you hear ferl.<br />When I was just dabbling someone told me coke was called girl &amp; H was called boy, so thats how all that started.

				8 years ago around my area Ecstasy pills were called &quot;small boys&quot;. To us it wasn&#039;t about keep it on the dl it was rebelling by saying fuck you, this is just as likely to get your attention.<br /><br />Just as dumb as any other slang.

				I&#039;m not going to lie, I came to this thread in extreme confusion about a &quot;little boy&quot;. <br /><br />Perhaps you should change the thread title, a tad misleading
