				Well, I am in a unique position.&nbsp; I live in an area where you can sell bud that is considered mid-grade by Cali standards for a high price, hence the 20$ a gm price tag.<br /><br />I can sell bubble hash for 40-50$ a gram if it&#039;s of decent quality.

Its a joke<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy weed but powder wise, I&#039;ve seen people sell grams that weigh 0.7/8. I remember once someone sold someone I was with a gram of mephedrone and it weighed .6 <br /><br />Needless to say he got his money back

				My 1 gram bag weighs 0.80 - 0.90.<br />You got to make profit somehow.<br />When I first started selling weed I also did 0.80g bags and when i passed it to my customer he was like &quot;woow..there must be over a gram here&quot; ;D

				once i got on my feet financially standard prices I would offer (depending on how i see fit with the quality of the herb.. this is in USD) 15 a g, 20 for 1.2, 30 for 2, 45 for 8th, 85 quarter, 160 half, 300z... sometimes, if the herb wasn&#039;t top notch or I got a better deal on that I would drop 15 to 20 bucks on halfs and oz&#039;s to frequent buyers. now to my friends i still would do 15 a g 30 for 2(those two were always fair to me, 20 bucks for 1 g is a bit steep in my opinion and i like to think im saving someone 5 bucks for food or whatever else. but if they choose to drop 20 ill throw them a bit extra) 40 an 8th, 80 quarter &amp; for those who wanted to sell &amp; were consistant 150 half, 280 zip.. prices would get better with bulk, but were nonnegotiable unless I was speaking with a serious buyer. Once all your friends or ounce &quot;dealers&quot; start getting an idea of what you pay, shit hits the fan because of their greed &amp; then &quot;friends&quot; will try to manipulate you(at least that was the case for me). everyone is happy with prices until they find out what YOUR prices are. So anyway to answer what you are inquiring about, your prices in my honest opinion are more than fair, those are your prices &amp; it is what it is. hes getting a bit more than what most would expect anyway. Some people are just spoiled rotten. If hes upset with the weight from the amount he has paid. Tell him to find the guy that he thinks will do him one better, take his business elsewhere, &amp; to leave you alone next time. In a mature, respectful way of course. I don&#039;t know you at all obviously, but Im sure you have better things to set your mind to than hearing some brat complain about .05 off(which is like pixie dust anyway). Its nothing worth holding up your daily duties of the world to take care of immediately. shit happens, and if i were you &amp; this matter was addressed appropriately(idk HOW you were approached about this but) itd be nothing I wouldnt give back on the next purchase. When small time buyers have .00 scales or whatever its the most annoying thing. when i did my thing i only had a .0 scale so its inevitable that it would be sometimes .00 whatever light(or heavy) and it was always completely unintentional! SOME people i use to encounter never understood that the scums who made a quick buck off ripping people off .2 or whatever everytime dont make a fraction of as much to those who are honest, consistent, and reliable. They just think anyone and everyone is out to play them. So keep up with what you are doing dude, i see no flaws.
