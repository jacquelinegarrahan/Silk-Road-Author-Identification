				Yes, the powers that be can destroy people secretly.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it happens as much as you would think, although the cases of John Lennon, Tupac Shakur, and Christopher Wallace were definitely allowed to happen by police.&nbsp; Think of creativity as a finite amount of work of a certain quality, that can be produced by an individual.&nbsp; Once they run out of original ideas, or the ability to create works that keep complimenting themselves.&nbsp; If you run out of that energy, lets say the scene changes, you change, the fall from extreme popularity and worship to being a regular joe is not tolerable for some.&nbsp; Others just take risky chances with their lives, but either way, they gave 100% of what they had to give.&nbsp; It pisses me off when I hear that &quot;oh if kurt cobain were alive, he&#039;d kick drugs and write 1000000 more hit songs&quot; that is bullshit.&nbsp; If Kurt Cobain were alive, he would write little indie song and stuff that some of his fans would appreciate, but not the masses.&nbsp; The masses kill artists, as does the industry surrounding the arts.&nbsp; Did someone kill Kurt? IDK, he was making music that didn&#039;t really synch with what the studios and other people wanted, maybe he just got sick of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The real test of this is if you look at how many songs he recorded, compared to how many have been released posthumously.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don&#039;t think courtney love would have passed on releasing his songs 1 or 2 at a time, ad infinitum, you are crazy.&nbsp; Tupac is another good example, people would release the unreleased songs, if they were hits, but 99% of them aren&#039;t.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not saying that they suck, just that they don&#039;t appeal to a big enough audience for the record labels to care or for consumers to find the work published.&nbsp; It sometimes is better to burn out, than to fade away, but I don&#039;t understand why someone would throw it away rather than quit while ahead.&nbsp; Always quit when you&#039;re ahead.
