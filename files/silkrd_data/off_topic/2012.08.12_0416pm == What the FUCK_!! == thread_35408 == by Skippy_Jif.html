				Has anyone seen this new drugfree.org commercial where the father beats the shit out of his son&#039;s TV? What the fuck?<br /><br />How fucking violent is this country with their anti-drug propaganda? Jesus Christ they send mixed messages! Burn in Hell you fucking lunatics!

				*CLEARNET*<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGNZ9mEzzQ<br /><br />Here&#039;s the ad for anyone interested, it doesn&#039;t really work on an anti-drug level I think, unless they are advocating smashing your kid&#039;s stuff because of DRUGS in his room, in which case they&#039;re cunts. I think they&#039;re trying to stop parents from going apeshit on their kids though and have a measured response to drug use, but I&#039;m not American and don&#039;t really know what they do. I want to hope it&#039;s the later, but the name &#039;Drugfree&#039; isn&#039;t a good thing.<br /><br />http://www.drugfree.org/drug-guide<br />&nbsp;:o

				It&#039;s a mixed message because it focuses on the kid afterwards. It is fear mongering, but they throw in a little message at the end to justify they&#039;re the good guys. It&#039;s complete bull shit and they should be ashamed of themselves. Just look at who contributes funding to them.

				agreed. it does send sort of a mixed message. obviously they&#039;re using the dad smashing stuff as a metaphor for why his kid shouldn&#039;t do drugs. ie although he may have the desire to smash all of his kid&#039;s shit with a baseball bat, it doesn&#039;t mean that he can or should do it. This metaphor could be used in a million different parenting scenarios, yet they decided to focus on drug use instead. <br /><br />it&#039;s the same bullshit DrugFree has been pulling for years now. Totally off base and exaggerated events, or even completely made-up and falsified information, in order to get THEIR message across. It&#039;s a pretty solid parallel for how most organizations like DrugFree are run here in the States (see: any political campaign ever run). This is just a good example of how far off base these organizations need to go in order to jam their message down the throat of the American audience. Absolutely pathetic. <br /><br />Good news is I don&#039;t know one person (drug user, or not) who buys into this bullshit. These type of ads would have been more successful in the 70&#039;s with Nixon around. And fortunately for us, most people the only people buying into that type of cheap advertising are out-of-touch Grandparents.<br /><br />And who listens to those old bastards, anyway?&nbsp; ;D

				If they want to sent an effective anti-drug message they need to show the kid getting high then cut to him sucking some dude off in the alley for another rock, then pan up to REVEAL its the father. <br /><br />That or just loop requiem for a dream

				I remember a few months ago they put out a commercial with a kid doing parkour on 10+ story buildings. He was jumping from one building to the next then the camera turns to some teenagers sharing a joint sitting down watching this guy. One kid asks him if he would like to take a hit and chill.<br /><br />The parkour kid ultimately says no and then goes back to jumping from rooftop to rooftop. The ad ends with &quot;Above the Influence&quot;<br /><br />I lol&#039;d ever so hard.

				I&#039;m just going to come out and say it..<br />I think this ad is better than a whole lot of anti-drug ads out there. The message was, &quot;Sometimes what you want to do isn&#039;t what you should do.&quot; I think this says a lot about what goes on in the minds (and in some houses) of parents. They want to get so angry that they trash their kid&#039;s stuff, but this isn&#039;t how it should be handled. Talking to your kids and being honest about the good and bad sides to drugs is the best thing to do. I absolutely loathe those anti-drug PSA ads that use scare tactics rather than to be honest about drugs.<br /><br />sdesu
