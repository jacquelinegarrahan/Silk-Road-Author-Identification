				Marijuana made me a bit chubbier thanks to the munchies, and kept me entertained for about a year and a half. MDMA gave me the most euphoric night of my life, and made me embarrass the hell out of myself. Alcohol made me vomit everywhere and left a permanent stain in my carpet. Mushrooms &amp; DMT made me reconsider being an atheist, and got me to appreciate the natural beauty of nature, whereas before I used to despise the outdoors and just wanted to hide in my room all day

				As of yet, I haven&#039;t had a profound life-changing experience with any drug. Hopefully this will change once I order some Pharmayahuasca from DiMiTriSpice&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve used Adderall for years to help me get through almost all of my schooling, and I&#039;m not ashamed to admit that. I&#039;ve made it through high school, got into an awesome tier 1 university, as well as one of the top medical schools in the country, so I&#039;ve obviously done something right. <br /><br />In regards to recreational use of drugs, yes, I enjoy doing them as much as anyone else here, but I&#039;ve been smart enough to know when it&#039;s time to party and when it&#039;s time to do work, I know my limits and my expectations.<br /><br />As DiMiTrSpice says, &quot;Be safe, know your body, know your drug, do the research.&quot;<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				Well that&#039;s a loaded question, isn&#039;t it. I guess I&#039;ll list some of the cooler impacts.<br />When I refer to the drug by name, I&#039;m generally talking about one specific experience out of many.<br /><br />* DMT made me doubt my atheism for a bit.<br /><br />* LSD made me permanently immune to suicidal ideation, <br />and made me restart my hobbies of painting and playing piano,<br />which I still engage in whenever I have time<br /><br />* Methamphetamine made me spend close to 90% of my earnings at one point,<br />and gave me the best sexual experiences of my life<br /><br />* Mushrooms made me participate in environmentalist activism,<br />and essentially a very liberal mentality <br /><br />* Heroin made me get an EMT certification.<br /><br />* 2C-I made me experience ego death, which is quite different from DMT ego-death, in the sense that it was more comprehensible. I saw myself, the system: (&quot;ZA6&quot; definition: a collection of programs running to maximize probability of survival). I saw multiple personalities manifesting at once, and how they influenced my decisions.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />******** Drugs made me pursue a career in chemistry and drug synthesis ********

				I&#039;m honestly surprised at the lack of interest in this topic.<br />We are on the largest &quot;public&quot; private drug market on the Internet, where we can have nearly every &quot;drug&quot; sent right to the doorstep, yet they haven&#039;t had a real impact on your life? I far doubt that and just believe this thread is over looked. If drugs had no impact on life they would have no use. ;)

				Drugs make me more open in general, obviously not things like weed etc but mdma mainly. Speed gave me the confidence to talk to the hottest chiks when im out without sounding like a tool to them<br /><br />I think in moderation they can generally shape you in more of a positive person, sometimes its hard to reframe but it makes it all worth it! Currently on md btw LOL<br /><br />

In the entire 20 years on earth I spent before trying psychedelics my mind was so closed to things outside society. I was told, EDUCATED, that all drugs are bad and that they will all fuck you up. These things broke me out of society and allowed me to appreciate me for me. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also given them to two women who each had different things going bad for them, one was more depressed than the other, and their lives both changed instantly for the better after the trips.<br /><br />You&#039;re right though, the wrong ones used the wrong way can really do you in.

				There has been a lot of bad, many negative effects.<br /><br />At the same time, I don&#039;t know how I would have overcome all my anxieties and fears without the reality-shattering effects of my drug use.<br /><br />Drugs, for me, have been like taking two steps back so that I would eventually take one step forward.<br /><br />I don&#039;t regret anything. There has been a lot of pain but I think, overall, I am more mature at this point in my life because of the drug use. Kind of like throwing myself into the fire and coming out stronger.<br /><br />In retrospect, I wouldn&#039;t recommend drug use to anyone because things could have ended up a lot worse.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I went off to college and smoked a lot more than I should have. I ended up in a psych ward for a week and a half due to a psychotic break from smoking too much cannabis. I now know that you can smoke too much cannabis and that I probably have some underlying mental issues. <br /><br />I still love pot but don&#039;t see how it has benefited my life. Now strong sativas make me anxious and seeing as how that&#039;s popular around my area I can&#039;t find any Indicas and when I do I can never get a hold of the &quot;vendor&quot; again. So I&#039;ve stopped using cannabis for a bit. <br /><br />• Nutmeg made me laugh at the mundane and find humor in church as well as pretty much started me down the road of drugs. <br /><br />• Sativa makes me a certified crack head around certain friends who bring that out in me. <br /><br />• Indica/Sativa hybrids are my favorite and increase introspective analysis, the enjoyability of music as well as take the edge off my newly developed anxiety. <br /><br />• LSD sent me on a psychedelic mission to get blasted into space and further my experience in the realm of spirituality. I love L and hope to find more. Having only done it 3-4 times at low (~70ug - 200ug) dosages I can&#039;t really say much about the hallmark effects.<br /><br />• Alcohol makes me everyone&#039;s best friend. Seriously. <br /><br />• DXM made me realize how wasteful I can be... with my money. I may never buy OTC DXM products ever again after only ~4 experiences. <br /><br />• MDMA is great! I tried it twice and loved it both times. Want to try it at a club setting (Hopefully with me as the DJ). People seem to think I am a smug jerk. AT heart I am not but I guess it can seem that way, I often have no expressive response for things I should feel emotional about. I try to be friendly but at times I find it futile. If I could have MDMA pumped into me every day maybe that would go away. Awesome experience. Not to be missed with good friends and even better tunes. <br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been doing some thinking about drug use and see no reason to delve into it. If life is good why change it? I tried Cannabis at 16 and I liked it but there was no reason to keep going. I was searching for a high. A high that I found many times after my first few experiences but I haven&#039;t really gained anything from my use. <br /><br />Some may say drugs are like food. You are willing to pay good money for some good food that tastes great and makes you feel good. But food is necessary for life. Some drugs or most drugs aren&#039;t necessary but they can easily become a necessary part of your day if abused. I&#039;ll undoubtedly raise my kids to understand, and respect drugs and their users but wouldn&#039;t care either way about their position on the matter. As long as they have the common sense and education I think they&#039;ll make responsible decisions when it comes to drugs. I didn&#039;t act responsibly even with the education and respect. That may just be a character flaw. But then again why am I talking about kids when I&#039;m only 18. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />-Liquid Eater

				Drugs to me have been the cause, and solution to, all of my lifes problems. <br /><br />Let me elaborate........<br /><br />I started out smoking weed. I was infactuated by cannabis from as early as 12 years old. Smoking became a daily ritual. If i didnt smoke on any given day, it was all i thought about and i was pretty much an asshole until i had another puff of that sweet sweet cheeba.<br /><br />LSD was the next drug i tried after marijuana and of course alcohol (which goes without further mention because it has and always will be a daily part of my life for a long time now). I remember my first trip.... Laughing my balls off with my friends...not just chuckles or laughter from a funny joke, but that strong laughter you get where your stomach hurts for a few days later. But something else was happening...conversations were deeper... I had known my friends for years, but that night the discussions we had we truly opened our eyes to the world and things would never be the same.<br /><br />My first LSD trip was also the first time i dabbled in cocaine. Just did a couple of small bumps from one of the older dudes at a party i was at. I slowly started doing cocaine and incorporated it into my daily drug routine. Mostly sniffing, but sometimes adding a 100 mgs or so to a joint or blunt with my MJ and smoking it. Woolies we called em....<br /><br />Then ecstasy hit the scene and once i took a pill it instantly became my new drug of choice. It was everywhere and i had unlimited access to it. I was just a dumb kid who had no access to harm reduction sites that exist now and over&nbsp; a few month binge i depleted my serotonin levels and began suffering from panic attacks and anxiety. I had no self control and ended up fucked up in the head still to this day....<br /><br />Along the way i came across some mushrooms....I think it was due to my lack of serotonin, but i had a horrible trip where i suffered ego death. I thought i was going to die that night and although i survived the trip, i was left with hppd and i havent been the same since. There is something about ego death that causes you to realize how insignificant you really are in this world and how life is so short and meaningless. To this day i have social anxiety and always put everyone else above myself. Self confidence is zero, and im a good looking, smart, and well educated semi successful individual. Ive accomplished so much in my life, but cant accept that im worth 2 goddamn shits.....Its hard to explain but my life is daily struggle....<br /><br />Then i discovered opiates....Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh finally some relief. I feel like a million bucks when im high, and i even have to power to shut of my brain from its crazy ramblings if i ingest enough to just nod out and say fuck the world. Its a selfish thing to do, and i often fuck people i know over to enjoy the peaceful serenity of a good old fashioned nod session, but i feel i earned it. Why cant i be selfish sometimes??????<br /><br />Anyway i love drugs. Yes they have caused me some problems in my life, but they have also always been there for me unlike many people in my life who have fucked me over. <br /><br />There is so much more to this story, but ive said more than enough. Im very grateful for silkroad and the community here on the forums. Sites like erowid are really great too and help with harm reduction and information to avoid misuse of the thousands of different mind altering substances out there. I wish i knew growing up what i know now about responsible drug use. Drugs have been such a major part of my life...honestly i spend more time, energy, and money on drugs than anything else which is kind of sad but at the same time its so deeply instilled inside of me i honestly dont feel like its that bad. It just sucks that i or anyone else has to fear being thrown in a cage because of the desire to explore our minds through the use of recreational drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				weed treats all my pain, depression, etc. shrooms allowed me to start healing from a decade long illness. mxe and dmt made me realize the power of my own mind, and that i could even heal in the first place. mdma saved my relationship. every trip i take is one step closer to getting well.
