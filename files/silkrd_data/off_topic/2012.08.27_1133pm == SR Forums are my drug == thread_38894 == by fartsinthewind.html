				No drugs anywhere in sight....so for now SR and Bluelight forums are my drugs! <br /><br />Anybody else find themselves doing this while they wait for their shit to show up? Currently I&#039;m on a budget where i only have about $100 bucks every two weeks to spend, so after i get bent over by BTC vendors and everything else, it turns out to be closer to $80. Ha. Here&#039;s hoping it shows :)

				hell yea bro we are in the same boat. I sell shit on craigslist and have a minimum wage job. I have child support along with regular bills. i wouldn&#039;t have internet if it was only me paying the bills. Me and the old lady split the bills thank God. I mow yards and whatever so I can buy shit from the road and then you got these rich pricks who down me for not being a big spender. Yea I am addicted to these forums but I have loved to go to forums in many areas like topix forums and torrent forums. I got a little dignity tho. I dont give head or anything like that. I do collect aluminum cans but it takes a friggin year to have enough to buy a gram of coke

				Financial concerns aside, these forums are most enjoyable. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see more trip reports like Erowid, not just &quot;woah dude that shit was da chronix&quot; type ones either.

I just moved here 4 months ago and i am just starting to get to know who wants what. Everybody wants roxy 30&#039;s but they are the same price here as in real life so i can&#039;t make nothing there. I am thinking about some mids weed because that would sell good here. The medicinal grade stuff is great but people around here are like&quot;I aint giving 25 bucks a gram for pot no matter how good it is&quot; but they&#039;ll give $5 a j all day long for mids and there&#039;s a couple of mid dealers with great prices. The 25c I been getting is gaining popularity here and I have been honest about it. I would never try to say it&#039;s acid like some folks would.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38894.msg435754#msg435754">Quote from: fartsinthewind on August 28, 2012, 03:00 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=38894.msg435560#msg435560">Quote from: ralph123 on August 28, 2012, 01:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">hell yea bro we are in the same boat.

My family members go to clinics and sometimes they will turn me on to a 30 but that&#039;s it. I&#039;d rather not have somebody know my business and try to hold it over my head. I would rather not be caught hanging around the wrong crowd. I&#039;d rather not end up in a brawl because some dickwad try to rip me off in broad daylight. Yea I like this SR setup really good. Hell I am home more then I have ever been and that keeps the chances of me going back to jail pretty low.

				^ right on bro. I feel the same way. I bet if i creeped around town I could find what i&#039;m looking for, but i&#039;d rather do it here. Sure, it sucks getting a package lost or scammed, but at least nobody is gonna kick your teeth in. Except maybe the DEA at your door hahaha

				hahaha right on I didn&#039;t lose my front teeth from bad hygiene hahaha but my partials look real. I was homeless at one time and lived on the streets of a magor city. You will not believe what kind of shit your capable of when it&#039;s a have to case. really learned a lot about myself during those times but to be honest i chose to do that kind of like christain bale in batman. I wanted to get out there and see for myself what it was like. I got tired of people around me telling me how it is and shit so I walked with nothing but the clothes I had on. Lived on the streets of the worse hood in Ktown. Met some descent folks and some desperate rippers and got into a few scrapes. Escaped death on more then 3 occasions. Faced up against knives and was shot at on two different occasions during those times. I had been shot at during another time all together tho. yea I have no doubt that god loves me. All that shit happened after i lost my daddy back in 2002. I lost it. That was the first time I had lost someone so close to me. I flipped out and did not care if I lived or died.&nbsp; Went to jail several times
