				I&#039;m so jealous you were tripping balls in an empty movie theater watching an amazing movie while smoking that seems like so much fun. It would have been a complete mind fuck for me to be in there all by myself though knowing me I&#039;d probably constantly be trying to figure out why I&#039;m the only one in there lol. +1 though for having an awesome time, seeing good movies while tripping is something else, especially if you&#039;ve already seen the movie the change in perspective of the film can be astonishing.
