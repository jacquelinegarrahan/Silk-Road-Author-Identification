				Big +1 - I too found my love of psychedelics fostered by Erowid&#039;s informative library. It also began much of my love of documenting my experiences. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I REALLY don&#039;t like to part w/my cash or btc. BUT in this case it was a no brainer. 10 btc from me! Erowid deserves it!! It&#039;s good to see a lot of people feel the same.

				Thanks for letting me know about this. As a responsible seller on Silk Road, we think it&#039;s important to support causes such as Erowid to help bring drug education to the masses.<br /><br />We have also made a 10 BTC donation to Erowid. This site has educated our team over the years of experimenting with interesting substances.<br /><br />Long live Erowid!<br /><br />EnterTheMatrix

				I donated btc as well. Erowid as an amazing site, my first stop on any drug related question. When i think about it there are only 2 sites i have ever donated money to: Wikipedia and Erowid. They both have similar philosophy, which is coincidentally the same philosophy i share :), that knowledge should be freely given to those who ask for it.<br />Long live Wikipedia and Erowid!

				Thank you for posting this! Erowid also played a major role in my development as a psychonaut and was my homepage for many years. <br /><br />Here is a link for donating to Alexander Shulgin Collection I thought might be worth sharing:<br />http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/get-involved/donate/<br /><br />&quot;Alexander and Ann Shulgin are well-known elders who have been working in the field of psychoactive research for decades. They have a large collection of both primary and secondary physical materials that need to be organized, archived and made publicly available. We are seeking $25,000-$50,000 for this project to support scanning and processing costs. Donations can be made either through Erowid Center, or directly to the Shulgins.&quot;
