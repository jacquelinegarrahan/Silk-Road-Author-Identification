				I would recommend Church. My local connect used to get it all the time, I saw Pot2Peer had some but didn&#039;t have pics so can&#039;t verify if that&#039;s the same stuff or not.<br /><br />My girl very rarely smokes and refuses to smoke out of my bong, if she dose I have to hold it, light it, tell her when to stop inhaling etc. Yea it&#039;s that bad, and a tiny hit she&#039;s coughing her lungs up.<br /><br />Point is, she&#039;s not a smoker and she actually liked Church. It was really long piney emerald green nugs, looked like the pine tree of cannabis.<br /><br />All the girls say it smelled and tasted like mint, although I didn&#039;t think so. Smelled piney to me and tasted like weed...It was an ongoing discussion every time I got Church, no guy thought it smelled like mint yet 5+ girls all claimed it smelled like mint to them, no idea how that would be but whatever. Get Church, girls love it.

				Ever tried Bubblegum?&nbsp; I&#039;m smoking some right now as it happens, and it sounds like exactly what you are looking for.&nbsp; Very smooth and easy on the throat, with a nice sweet taste and distinctive odor.&nbsp; <br /><br />The high is euphoric and energetic with virtually no couchlock,&nbsp; which doesn&#039;t appeal to everybody, but it&#039;s been a nice change for me after years of smoking mainly indicas and hash, with the inevitable lethargy and fuzziness that comes with them.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if there is any available on the road right now, but it&#039;s a great strain if you can source it.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure &quot;the ladies&quot; would love it.&nbsp; ;) ;D

				I think Sweet Tooth is exactly what your looking for. A very sugary/sweet strain that gives you an extremely nice stone. Cannamed had some of the best on the road but he is taking a break for a few weeks. Grape Ape has a very sour (in a good way) and grape like taste which you and the ladies may find appealing.

				I know you are looking for strains but perhaps method of ingestion would help too, if you pick up a vaporizer they tend to be nice and smooth, and very easy on the throat I recommend an Iolite Portable Vape<br /><br />http://www.iolite.com/index.php/default/our_products/
