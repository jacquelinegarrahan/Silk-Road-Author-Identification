				As someone wise once said, you dont need to be a Muslim to support the plight of the Palestinians, you just need to be a human being. <br /><br />http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/Gaza_appeal.aspx<br /><br />Please allow me to start with this: I have ZERO interest in starting some kind of Anti-Israel thread, this isn&#039;t the place for such a thing<br /><br />I am not interested in discussing Hamas Vs IDF or anything close to that in this thread, nor am I interested in discussing <br /><br />Israel has a right to defend themselves Vs So do the Palestinians against Israel<br /><br />Afterall many Israelis protest in Tel Aviv right now against this attack on Gaza, many soldiers have refused to serve, and MANY Jewish people and Rabbi&#039;s <br />globally have protested strongly and in times far more aggressively than me against the state of Israel, no kind of prejudices even come into it<br /><br />Personally I believe, if you have an Oppressed and an Oppressor, always side with the Oppressed.<br /><br />But lets bring this down to facts<br /><br />Fact: There are, last I checked 650+ Severely injured people right now, of which HUNDREDS are CHILDREN &amp; INFANTS, These are innocent human beings in this conflict <br />Fact: Before this recent soar in violence began, Hospitals in Gaza where short of such things as paracetamol (Aspirin) such a basic thing, imagine how it is now.. they desperately need help<br />Fact: There are innocent men and women, children, infants currently in hospital and either in critical condition or in agonizing pain, what you give, even cents or pennies could literally save life&#039;s<br />Fact: They are in desperate desperate need of equipment, people WILL die because they dont have enough, people will be dying as I type this <br /><br />That&#039;s all it comes down to, literally guys, you sending money could save a life.<br /><br />They are talking about invading by ground next, and if 08/09 was anything to go by the number of casualties and therefor need for medical equipment and aid <br />will be HUGE<br /><br />The charity I am posting is posted for a very specific reason, this Charity is trusted and more importantly just days ago (the 15th November) they gave Â£1 Million pounds<br />worth of equipment and aid DIRECTLY to Gaza Hospitals, as in they visited the hospitals themselves, confirmed it was going where it was meant to, I know this because its been confirmed AND I know people in Gaza, which is where I also have a lot of information coming<br /><br />Citizens of Gaza have no bunkers to hide in, approx 1.5 Million people (50% of which are under 18) crammed into a TINY space, seriously there are many cities multiple times larger than Gaza, and for citizens of the UK, the entirety of Israel/Palestine could fit inside of Wales, now go look how small Gaza is and know it was under siege before this, meaning there is no escape, you get an idea of how &quot;shooting fish in a barrel&quot; the situation is.<br /><br />http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/Gaza_appeal.aspx<br /><br />Please, PLEASE, Look into your heart and give something, even loose change, loose change is amazing, it took me literally a minute and a half to do it, so even if you donate 70p, or a dollar<br />or hell 5 cents, it all adds up, and it feels amazing to give to the needy<br /><br />The great thing is, because Islamic Relief have buildings and offices so close to Gaza geographically they can get this aid to them very quick, so within a week or less<br />your donation could be used to supply much much needed equipment <br /><br />Thank you, and for those of you that believe in God (I dont personally) please pray for Gaza tonight :( <br /><br />http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/Gaza_appeal.aspx<br /><br />I gave what I could, and will do again later next time I get paid, if you donated post in here to bump it and well done :) you have done something truly selfless <br /><br />Please - PLEASE help save an innocent life, or ease the pain of someone who has just lost a limb (I&#039;ve seen quite a few pictures, they even attacked RussiaToday&#039;s building and one of their Cameramen lost a leg) who also has the pain of knowing many of his family members are now either dead or could be by the time he leaves the hospital (like the 11 members of a single family, 4 of whom children that where killed yesterday) <br /><br />http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/Gaza_appeal.aspx<br /><br />Thank you

				Ive been a life long active supporter of The Palestinian Struggle against Zionism and the artificial country its up against, <br /><br />Donate what you can, these people are the epitome of what suffering under the occupation of barbaric religious terrorists are. You have one of the worlds biggest nuclear and military powers up (illegally occupying Palestine) against empty rockets used as scare tactics and sticks and stones, the fucking animals should be ashamed of themselves. They have every right to resist and fight back. <br /><br />Long Live Palestine!

				You Started nice - sticking to the facs can be even better :)<br /><br /><br />1. 130 dead compared to Israel 3, THREE, out of those 130, 2/3rds Civilians, out of those 2/3rd civilians around half Children<br /><br />What does the numbers have to do with anything?<br /><br /><br />===&gt;&nbsp; 2/3rds Civilians - that&#039;s plain bullshit.&nbsp; 2/3 rocket launchers and other terrorists<br /><br />==&gt; if Hamas wouldn&#039;t hide behind their own civilians while launching rockets at israeli cities for the last 12 years&nbsp; there were 0 dead.<br /><br />==&gt; if Hamas wouldn&#039;t shoot 12&#039;000 (!!!) rockets **every year**&nbsp; without any reason (let me remind you that Israel left Gaza 100% at 2005, so why shooting?) on Israeli cities there were 0 dead Palestinians.<br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas would not suicide bomb buses and clubs and kill Israeli civilians there were 0 dead Palestinians<br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas / Abu mazen&nbsp; would accept the offer of 3 Israeli prime ministers to get back 98% of all the occupied territories in exchange for peace, there was peace by now! (sharon &amp; rabin &amp; Olmert) - but they chose to start the second intifada. and than the other stuff..<br />egypt and jordan excepted - and WOW - there is peace for years!<br /><br />===&gt; Gaza was not getting electricity from Israel there was no electricity there! - without paying! (let me remind you again that Israel left Gaza 100% at 2005)<br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas and the rest of the idiots would accept the fact that israel is here to stay and not wishing to go back to the time before 1948 (and declaring they would want all the Jews out) it was peace by now.<br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas would not try to send 1000&#039;s of KG&#039;s of&nbsp; explosives every year trough the borders - to Israel, they would have free supply of everything all the time with shit loads of money from israel (like it was in the past)<br /><br />===&gt; if they would not kill every person they don&#039;t like and drag their bodies on the streets of Gaza with motorcycles the world might look at them as humans rather than crazy killers.<br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas would use the tunnels he uses to smuggle high-tech weapons into Gaza from Iran to smuggle supply and medicine to Gaza, there were no shortage of anything!<br /><br />===&gt; If Iran and all the other countries wanted to help Gaza they should have built it and developed Gaza - not send weapons <br /><br />===&gt; if Hamas had cared about hes people he should have spent hes grants money from all over the world to build up Gaza which can be one of the most beautiful place in the world and attract tourism , like it did in the past!<br /><br />====&gt; If Hamas would not make terrorist nests in Sinai, Egypt would let them enter freely into Egypt and make their trade there.<br /><br />==&gt; if all the other arab countries cared so much about the Palestinians they would help them, not shut up while they are bombed and closed their boarder to keep them out.<br /><br />Should i continue? i have lots more.<br />Know the facts. not the shit from the media. lots of &quot;ifs&quot;... (on both sides)<br /><br />* if you send them money make sure it goes to hospitals and not for weapons, send directly to hospitals there not the organization being taxed by hamas to get more weapons and than bombed again after israel being quiet for 4 year and cry why there are dead!<br /><br />Peace and love to the middle east &amp; the rest of the world, really, i love both sides and hate whats going on there :)

				You start off all righteous by saying this is not about taking sides, Not interested in Hamas Vs IDF.. and progress to saying you should only give your money to Palestine because Israel isn&#039;t worthy.. I&#039;ve got little time for political debates on this forum. But the poster above me said it perfectly.. There were Israelis killed in rocket attacks by Hamas so there IS a need to help Israelis as much as there is to help Palestinians.. If Palestinians were without blame, if they fired no rockets and transported no explosives my point of view would be different. My point is there are injured on both sides.. You are clearly pro Palestine so you are in no position to state that you are purporting an unbiased view. Clearly come out and say you are Pro Palestine and you want people to donate.. Don&#039;t masquerade as being unbiased and then say ah but only give your money to Palestine its all the Israelis fault.. 12,000 rockets can kill a lot of kids too.

I think that people should look to diplomacy always, I dont think invading a country is correct any more than I think that firing rockets at innocents is correct. I do not agree with murder 100%, not the death penalty, retaliation or war. I believe that we will only grow as a species when we realise that we are all the same and that land is not something we can claim as our own.. I also don&#039;t believe that it is right for people to jump on a band waggon and fuel racial tensions that ultimately cause more bloodshed.

Although it is under constant siege and surveillance by Zionism so it may aswell be! they aren&#039;t free. <br />Unfortunately things for the Palestinians and Bedouin are worse off in the west bank even,&nbsp; it IS occupied, as is the parts of Syria and The Lebanon by the same fascists. <br /><br />The thing i love about the Palestinians is that they never give up, ever, they fight suffer and struggle on till death, with whatever they can muster together before they are either murdered by Zionists or thrown in prison forever with no conviction or jury like they have had since the invasion. Balls of steel, I wish them every luck in their resistance as i would the Polish, French, Spanish (against Franco) Resistance during WW2 etc.<br /><br />

				let me rephrase what i said. azza, as it is truly called, is under occupation by hamas, the west bank, however, can be considered under occupation by israel. now, that being said, there are many people in the west bank, especially the palestinian christians, who prefer israel to be controlling the west bank over the fatah aka the PA. this is because since they are christian, they are persecuted by the religious Muslims in the area. a lot of you people are making statements about hamas, but it you want to know their true intentions, you need to read &quot;the son of hamas&quot; written by Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of one of the main founders of hamas. *** http://www.amazon.com/Son-Hamas-Gripping-Political-Unthinkable/dp/1414333080 *** .<br /><br />&nbsp;now, with your statement about bedouin being worse off, that is complete and utter horse shit! bedouin are full israeli citizens which serve in the IDF, as is the druzie population living in haifa. the druzie population living in the lower golan valley however are a bit different.<br /><br />now, with azza, when israel made the peace treaty with egypt and gave back the sinai, they tried to give egypt azza aswell, however egypt would not take it. israel has atempted many times to give it to egypt, but they refused every time. you see, the muslim countries do not truly like the palenstians, in jordan, they tried to kill the king, in lebanon, they are hezbullah and took over the government (and persecute the northern lebanese christians as well as assanated the former prim minister). israel tried many times to have the sorounding countries incorporate the palestinan peoples into their own, but they all refused because of the 1% that controls them (hamas as an example) are a bunch of extreamists. but, you have to remember, the jews are al dhimi, and therefore can not have their own land, aka the enemy of my enemy is my friend.<br />and if jerusalem is a holy city for islam, why did hamas launch rockets at it? what would have happened if hamas hit the dome of the rock or the al aska mosque? the rockets ended up hitting palestinan villiages in the west bank . . .<br /><br />i just want to clarify, i am not anti palestianian, i think we are all earthlings and all have a right to live in peace anywhere we chose, the death of any person is a same. . . but i will say i am anti hamas.

Everyone on this earth has the right to resist the occupation of their country or to defend themselves,their families and their communities, especially against people who are genocidal religious maniacs who dont recognise you as a nation or a people in the first place. Why didnt Zionists go to their &quot;Homeland&quot; in Uganda instead?? If the US stopped pumping its badly needed taxpayers money into its 51st militarized state in the middle east the &quot;country&quot; wouldn&#039;t exist!

				Israel has immense US backing - THAT&#039;S the difference. That&#039;s why I&#039;m more likely to give to Palestinian victims.<br /><br />OP is not taking sides, (I am though) he is focusing on a single tragic incident. There is no need to give to Israel because in this incident, the majority of damage fell on Palestinians.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I didn&#039;t want to get into a political thing (just explain why I donated the way I did) but the people trying to present Israel as needing and deserving help as much as Palestine are insane. There&#039;s one particular person: You admitted you don&#039;t know much about the conflict, yet you&#039;re talking like you&#039;re an authority.
