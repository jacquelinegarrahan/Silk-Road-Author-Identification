				Hello to all you fine people here at Silk Road!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />Wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced a loss in their SR wallet. I just recently changed my settings to show the dollar amount of things instead of the bit coin amounts. I noticed I was losing 3 cents a day. So if I were a bit coin minor and able to get 3 cents a day for just one day from each SR member then How long would it take me to have enough to buy a vendors account or an once of pot or a gram of coke or anything?<br /><br />This 3 cent loss happen for 3 days without any evidence in my transaction history. When i reported it to SR support, well, the next day I had a 1 cent increase lol. I just wanted to see the dollar prices on things. I never even expected to see something like that.<br /><br />I would like to challenge everybody here to change your settings to the monetary denomination used in your country and report it in this thread if you are experiencing any kind of loss.<br /><br />I would like to try to keep this place as honest as possible.&nbsp; If anybody that works on the SR support team can clarify this issue and let me know if I have made a mistake then by all means please do so with convincing evidence.<br /><br />Thanks everybody 8)<br /><br />

				The USD value of the button has been dropping the last few days.&nbsp; This should answer your question http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59117.0;topicseen<br /><br />Also when it comes to bitcoin mining your looking at like a six month wait before you&#039;ve generated enough to make an order i believe.&nbsp; There are alot more qualified people to answer your questions on btc mining hope that relieves any worry

				Well if the coin value&nbsp; changed or not it should have no effect on the amount of your cash that you have in your account. You notice that vendors hedge so they will be sure to get what dollar value they listed an item for.<br /><br />And as for bit coin mining, sure I know that they don&#039;t get paid unless they solve a bit coin chain block which it was suppose to be halved this month. So where does the reward come from when a minor solves the riddle?

				SR is just a bitcoin wallet.&nbsp; It is not like mtgox and it does NOT convert your bitcoins to usd.&nbsp; It does have a feature that will show you the value of your bitcoins in USD though.&nbsp; That is why the USD will change but the amount of btc in your wallet does not change.<br /><br />When you make a purchase, depending on the sellers settings, the coins may be hedged.&nbsp; That means the transaction will be tied to the USD (minus 4%) and at the time of finalize the amount of bitcoins the seller receives will be based on the bitcoin rate at the time of finalize as opposed to at the time of the order being placed.

				Ok thanks everybody for helping me clear that up. I know it took a couple of people but I got it now lol. I&#039;ll take down this thread in a little while&nbsp; <br /><br />I got the understanding after reading the last comment that when the value of the coin drops then it&#039;s only natural for your SR cash amount to drop. It kicked in after a couple of minutes and almost replying in a different way lol
