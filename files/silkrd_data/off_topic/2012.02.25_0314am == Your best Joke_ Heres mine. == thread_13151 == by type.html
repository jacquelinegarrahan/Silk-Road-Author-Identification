				Once upon a time, there was a cowboy who loved to spend his days off at a bar making conversation with random strangers that happened to show up.<br /><br />One day, he was sitting there, drinking his beer, when a man in a fancy suit showed up and fired up a little chat, asking the cowboy what he did for a living. When he said he was a cowboy, the stock broker asked what that meant. He answered: &quot;Well, I take care of cattle. In the mornin&#039; I milk the cows, then I set them loose on the fields, and I corral them all in for another milkin&#039; at the end of the day. It&#039;s all about the cows. What about you? What&#039;re you?&quot;<br /><br />So the stockbroker replied. &quot;I&#039;m a stockbroker. I buy, I sell, I calculate and try to predict the market. It&#039;s all about the numbers.&quot;<br /><br />A few minutes later, a man with long hair and a leather jacket came along and asked the cowboy about his job. &quot;Well, I take care of cattle. In the mornin&#039; I milk the cows, then I set them loose on the fields, and I corral them all in for another milkin&#039; at the end of the day. It&#039;s all about the cows. What about you? What&#039;re you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh, I&#039;m a rock star. I tour the world singing and playing my guitar and rocking out. It&#039;s all about the music.&quot;<br /><br />After a while, a very butch woman came along, dressed just like the cowboy, and asked him his business.<br />&quot;Well, I take care of cattle. In the mornin&#039; I milk the cows, then I set them loose on the fields, and I corral them all in for another milkin&#039; at the end of the day. It&#039;s all about the cows. What about you? What&#039;re you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m a lesbian. When I wake up, I&#039;m thinking about pussy. I eat my breakfast thinking about pussy, then I spend my whole morning thinking about pussy. During lunch, and all through the afternoon, I think about beautiful women and their pussies, and at night I go out on the town to try and score some pussy. It&#039;s all about the pussy.&quot;<br /><br />After she was gone, a man in a jumpsuit came along and asked the cowboy what he was.<br /><br />&quot;Well, I used to think I was a cowboy... but I just found out that I&#039;m actually a lesbian!&quot;

				One night a man comes stumbling out of a bar.<br />A nearby cop sees this and approaches the man.<br />&quot;I cant let you out on the streets in such a condition, I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll need to get a cab or have a friend pick you up&quot;<br />The man responds by arguing with the cop and saying he&#039;s perfectly fine.<br /><br />After this goes on for a few minutes the cop becomes annoyed.<br />He tells the man that if he can pass a simple test he can be on his way<br />The man agrees<br /><br />The officer pulls out his maglite, points it to the sky and turns it on.<br />He looks at the beam of light and says<br />&quot;if you can climb this pole I&#039;ll let you go home&quot;<br /><br />The guy looks at it and proclaims<br />&quot;you must be out of your mind&quot;<br /><br />The cop figures the dude must not be as drunk as he appears<br /><br />The man then says<br />&quot;I&#039;ll get halfway up and then you&#039;ll turn it off&quot;

				A duck walks into a bar and says, &quot;Do you have any grapes?&quot; <br />The bartender says, &quot;No, this is a bar, we don&#039;t have any grapes, I&#039;m sorry.&quot; And so the duck leaves.<br />The next day, the duck comes back and asks for grapes again, and the bartender says &#039;Like I told you last time sir, we have no grapes here, and we never will; this is a bar after all...&#039;<br />Next day, the same thing, duck asks for grapes, and the bartender goes &#039;I&#039;m sorry sir, but you come back in here and ask for grapes again, I&#039;m going to have to nail your bill to the counter.&#039;<br />So, the duck comes back the next day, in the evening, and says &#039;Got any grapes?&quot;<br /><br />The bartender sighs.<br /><br />He reaches down for a hammer and some nails, under the counter. But when he comes up, the duck has a shotgun pointed right at his face<br /><br />There is a pause.<br />The bartender starts to cry and says, &#039;Please ... please don&#039;t hurt me, I have three kids.&#039;<br />The duck&#039;s eyes are cold and alien.<br />He pulls the trigger and the bullets rip into the bartender&#039;s shoulder. He screams in agony, writhing on the floor, like a marrionette with its strings&nbsp; pulled at random.<br />The duck, climbs over the counter, being sure to step on the bartender&#039;s wounds to hurt him more.<br />The bartender&#039;s blood is spraying everywhere, and the duck is drenched in it.<br /><br />The duck opens the fridge behind the counter.<br /><br />And grapes fall out.<br /><br />The duck goes fucking insane, yelling, &quot;No grapes?! No grapes, huh?!&quot; He shoots the bartender, again and again in the face.<br />Just as his wife and children enter the bar.<br /><br />His wife screams in pain, and his three kids just go pale as fuck.<br />The duck turns around and starts laughing maniacally.<br />Then, he shoots them all, before turning the gun on himself.<br /><br />Thus, ending the joke.<br /><br />edit: A wizard walks down a street and turns into a super market.

I work long hours at unfair wages for my boss and it seems that neither of us know what i&#039;m doing there anymore. It seems as though the only thing that my boss knows is that he has power over me and that that makes him happy. My daughter was killed in the blizzard last year and i feel as though i no longer love my son. When i look at him, i see the same cowardice that i see when i look at the mirror. Maybe if i wasn&#039;t so cowardly i could bring myself some peace by grabbing the shotgun out from under my bed and end this horrible excuse for a life.&quot;<br />the dentist says &quot;moth you seem to be really troubled but why did you come to me? you should be&nbsp; seeing a psychiatrist.&quot;<br />the moth says &quot;the light was on.&quot;

There must be something wrong with the pills you gave me! My farts didn&#039;t stop, and what&#039;s worse!

				top ten worst puns:<br /><br />10. I went to a seafood disco last week… and pulled a mussel.<br /><br />9. Two antennas met on a roof, fell in love and got married. The ceremony wasn’t much, but the reception was great.<br /><br />8. A jumper cable walks into a bar. The bartender says, “I’ll serve you, but don’t start anything.”<br /><br />7. An invisible man marries an invisible woman. The kids were nothing to look at either.<br /><br />6. Patient: “I can’t stop singing ‘The Green, Green Grass of Home.’” <br />Doctor: “That sounds like Tom Jones Syndrome.” <br />Patient: “Is it common?”&nbsp; <br />Doctor: “It’s Not Unusual.” <br /><br />5. Two cows are standing next to each other in a field. Daisy says to Dolly, “I was artificially inseminated this morning.” “I don’t believe you”, says Dolly. “It’s true, no bull!” exclaims Daisy.<br /><br />4. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, so they lit a fire in the craft. It sank, proving once again that you can’t have your kayak and heat it too.<br /><br />3. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the manager came out of the office and asked them to disperse. “But why,” they asked, as they moved off. “Because”, he said, “I can’t stand chess-nuts boasting in an open foyer.”<br /><br />2. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He also ate very little which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. This made him….. A super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis. <br /><br />1. And finally, there was a person who sent 10 different puns to his friends, with the hope that at least 1 of the puns would make them laugh. No pun in ten did.
