				Hi,<br /><br />In a few weeks I am gonna go to a 7 day music festival and I plan to take some drugs with me. However, I&#039;m a bit scared about the bag-checks that they have at the entrance. Most people say that they don&#039;t look THAT well and if you hide your drugs well enough then you can get away with it. However, I don&#039;t know how well they mean by well enough.<br /><br />The drugs that I&#039;m planning to take are 8 pills of XTC, 6 blotters of LSD, some 2C-B in powder-form and last but not least, 150 mL of GHB. I&#039;m also taking speed with me, but I can get a statement from the doctor that those are medicines so that won&#039;t be a problem. Now I was thinking that the pills, the blotters and the powder are best hidden inside my tent. Because I can&#039;t imagine that they will unroll my tent when they check my bags. Is that a good idea? Or are there other better ideas? I have no idea how to hide 150 mL of GHB, because that is just pretty big. I don&#039;t even know where to get a 150 mL container (right now it&#039;s in a 500 mL water bottle).<br /><br />Could you people give me some advice on how to get these drugs in relatively safely.

				I am sure you can get some good ideas through an in depth google search, and people here may have some clever tricks as well. That being said, the safest thing to do is to find someone you trust who lives near the festival and mail everything ahead of time. As a general rule, prescription pills and medication, including small amounts of liquid medication, are not scrutinized by TSA and are permitted for travel. Vitamins and supplements are also allowed on the plane. Therefore, if you can disguise anything inconspicuously in gel capsules which can be stuffed in old pill bottles, that should suffice for some of what you are bringing. When I go through this, I just pick a friend and mail everything USPS priority. I would urge you to do the same. However, if you can&#039;t find a mailing address by your destination (even a hotel may hold your mail for you), then you should listen to other responses from people more experienced than me. Hope I could help some though.

				Personally, I would just NOT take the chance. Everything that cannot be legally explained should, at best, be mailed. The TSA is pretty smart when it comes to this sort of stuff and they do care (unlike the USPS).

They have electronic sniffers, ask you lots of question, dogs and all. While smalls amounts may be excused and disposed off at the customs anything above that will land you in serious shit. Worse hiding it inside your body would be considered drug trafficking no matter what amount, and then they`ll make you sit on their &#039;special&#039; toilet.

The customs officer can check your bag, and send the bag without its contents to the x-ray to detect any hidden items. Many returning passengers/tourists/students/workers are busted for bringing in uncanned foods/spices and things of organic origin. No one can even smuggle an apple or kiwi fruit through there. The fine for bringing in fruit and the items I just listed themselves are 220 AUD, if you don`t pay they take it to court. Seeing the problems that can arise from not declaring a fruit, imagine your pills. Your best bet is to buy it there or order from SR once you get there. Even their mail customs are well trained. Thats why many vendors here don`t offer refunds or even shipping to Australia. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30982.msg348471#msg348471">Quote from: weedsaves on July 16, 2012, 08:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I really do not like seeing threads like this, it just gives LE an extra page in their search and seizure manual.<br /><br />OP is taking such small amounts of drugs...be creative&nbsp; ???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its doesn`t give any new information to them. If they just discovered vacuum bags right now they`re wayy to behind. Vacuum bag are for making the product compact and to some degree smell proof. <br />

				Yeah it is. I hear lots of different story.

Just a peek in my runsack, thats all. Well, you can put the E into a condom or a plastic baggie tie the end with a string and swallow it, and tie the end of the string to one of your molars (back teeth). Once the coast is clear you can pull the string out along with the baggie.
