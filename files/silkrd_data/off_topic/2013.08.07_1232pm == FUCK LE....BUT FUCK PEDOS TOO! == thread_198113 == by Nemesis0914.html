				So i hear the freedom hosting author was arrested and is refused bail due to an extradition attempt by the u.s to try him for a whole number of pedo offenses. This is meant to be the same guy who created tor mail right? How ironic that such a liberating tool is used for the most grotesque, heinous and deceptive crimes. I hate fucking pedos , i wish them an eternity in hell for abusing the purest innocence known to man, the child.&nbsp; But i hate LE too, and these pedos are giving us tor/SR uses a bad name. They create heat for us, like a kid robbing on your block and bringing fedz. thats what happens to us. Why dont we honest SR users do the polices job and team up to rid the world of these cunts. I got love for fellow dealers man, but fuck the pedos. we should go undecover and shit and fuck these cunts up cos they bring heat!! what u guys think.

				Sure, but somewhere at this very moment some other people are conspiring to gang up and rid the world of sick and evil drug dealers. Drug dealers! They prey upon children! They destroy families! They force young women to sell their bodies! They smell like patchouli! So you get the idea. Pretty much everyone is in the crosshairs of someone else&#039;s morality.

				dont even feed the bait men. they want to talk about here but if no one else did they wouldnt. so just look past what they say, it may sound bad but they have a different state of mind then other people who are normal if you understand which i hope you do. over the past week ive seen way to many posts about CP and its got out of hand. this isnt what it is about, im sure you could find 1000 other sites on onion about that shit without even having to search for 5 minutes, so why talk about it here when people are going to diss you. go to some actual pedo file where people will agree with you and get it the fuck out of here. straight up.

Not just here, in several security oriented IRC channels I am in as well. The FH bust has been a really big trigger for this obviously. I am sorry to say that SR has been the only place I have seen people advocating for castration and murder, it really is the least rational place I have seen discussions of this spring up so far.

				I may be off key here, but someone really needs to create a hosted email in a extradition free country, and make sure that none of the shit hosted on there is kiddy porn, problem solved as long as they know what they are doing. Shit even take btc donations to host it im sure you could make some money. I may just be talking out of my ass but hell it would be nice to have a solid place to use email without worry of being busted cause some idiot decided to host child porn.

				The majority of you sound like pedophile sympathizers and you try to sound so intellectual with your fantasized, deep understandings of human nature and morality. So ill dumb this down for you. If you sympathize with pedos FUCK YOU. If you dont like talking about reality because it scares you on silk road, FUCK OFF . And if you dont agree with me on the topic of pedos, SHUT THE FUCK UP! real talk.&nbsp; Cos i promise all of you if any human being MIKE TYSON for example tried to justify pedophilia to me, i would do everything in my power to hurt that person.&nbsp; Drug dealing is in no way shape or form in the same league as pedos.

				With all this renewed attention to CP and pedos I wonder if/hope that pedobaiting will become a viable moneymaking option again. <br /><br />Normally scamming should earn you a IRL beating in my opinion but when it comes to pedos I say all is fair game, take their goddamn life savings if you can get by with it. Most are wise enough to know that past a certain point isn&#039;t worth it but every once in a while you get some sick middle aged professor who&#039;s married and a deacon in the community and they&#039;ll gladly fork over $250 in the hopes that you&#039;re not willing to risk anything taking their info to the cops or spreading it all over Facebook.<br /><br />Really other than lotteries I can&#039;t think of a better way to pay for trips on the Road than with the hardearned money of sick fucks. A few hours of work and the small amount of dignity associated with playing the pretend game for however long it takes can be a nice startup.

I agree drug dealing is in no way in the same league as pedos. <br />As far as what KMF said, ok maybe there have not been a lot of posts created by pedos my mistake but in my opinion one post justifying it is too much... and in the past I have seen people here boasting about it and justifying it. Why they come to SR?? beyond me...this place is for drugs not that shit. Furthermore I think its really important people understand that this is mostly a community of Addicts, and addicts IMO need to be this organized and anonymous because of the dangers we face but blah blah if i continue Id probably be preaching to the choir. While Im not calling for the death of pedos like some others and, i guess that pisses some off, I am deeply concerned that we will be grouped together with them in the end by LE in their efforts to take down the site. And thats not right. Like someone said in a different thread awhile back, most of us in this community are drug users, not to be confused with criminals, and dont commit any other crimes really than occasional or frequent drug use. This is of course up for debate, Im aware of that, but lets at least have the talk without threatening one another, its childish and solves nothing.

				Surely no one here thinks that taking down Freedom Hosting was primarily about preventing the circulation of CP? The deep web is not answerable to any authority; it is outside the US Government&#039;s control.

				HUGE difference between being attracted to 16 year olds and being attracted to children. For all of recorded history, until maybe the last 50 years, a 16 year old woman was suitable for marriage and starting a family. It&#039;s only in our overly prudish culture that someone attracted to a young woman would get smeared as a pedo. FWIW I prefer 21-25 year olds, but I&#039;m not criticizing anyone else&#039;s choices.<br /><br />I&#039;m stunned by the anger and rage from some here lately. Take a deep breath and relax.

I mean, I always knew there were laws against people looking at CP, and that the age of consent was 16-18, but I never realized how dead serious people took this matter until a few years ago when I started reasearching CP groups to see how they managed their security. I was really pretty shocked to see that people actually go to prison for decades for looking at pictures, and to realize that people actually claim to want to castrate everybody who thinks teenagers are sexually attractive. I must have been kind of young and naive myself, but I just had no clue people are so rabid and illogical about this. Prior to this I kind of assumed only the producers got in much trouble, kind of like how people don&#039;t usually get big charges for personal use possession of drugs but do for drug production and dealing. But these days it doesn&#039;t stun me anymore, I just feel kind of sad to live in a world dominated by emotional bigoted brainwashed dumb fucks, and wish that I could have been born just a few hundred years in the future. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It must be weird dropping your girlfriend off at highschool though.

If there is any genetic basis for attraction to partners of a certain age, it will be a miricle if anybody is actually more attracted to those who are 35+ than those who are 14-23 , because 35+ year olds have much lower fertility, and 14-23 year olds are at the peak of their fertility, which means that over the ages those who were attracted to 14-23 year olds the most would have passed their genes on, and people attracted to older people the most would have died out from their evolutionarily maladaptive behavior. From an evolutionary perspective it makes no sense that the average male would prefer 35 year olds to teenagers (and all the research shows that they don&#039;t).

				&quot;&quot;Sure fucking children is wrong. 14 year olds are not children.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />----THAT IS THE POINT !-- this is the key of the debate<br /><br />in my opinion, a 14 yo ( boy or girl ) can choose by himself to have sexual relation or not. (like you said, at this age you&#039;re &quot;physically&quot; ready for)<br /><br />but (s)he can also be more influenced by major people. MORE MORE EASILY<br /><br />so yep, its not a secret, teenage have sex...&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT WITH TEENAGE ONLY<br /><br />SURE 14 YO ARE NOT CHILDREN, BUT IT&#039;S SURE THEY&#039;RE NOT ADULT TOO...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again, &quot;Half your age + 7&quot;<br />Regardless of the legal age in your country if you stick to that your doing ok.<br /><br />I&#039;m beginning to think Americans have such a fucked up attitude toward sexuality reading some responses on here. <br />Just because it might be legal to have sex with 14 year old where I live doesn&#039;t mean people are doing it. <br /><br />Are people here suggesting 16 year old&#039;s are not having sex, Doesn&#039;t that come with a mandatory rape charge attached even if you are 16 yourself? <br />Is that not just a little fucked up??<br /><br />I think movie classifications sum this up best where in the states generally speaking movies that depict female orgasm or passionate lovemaking get slapped with a nc18 or whatever it&#039;s called but depicting rape and violence is just fine. I watched a Doc about the MPAA a while back and some of these points really stuck. <br />Just this summer I was running around naked at a few festivals but would never chance that shit in the US and pretty sure if&nbsp; I carried my way of being on over there I&#039;d be slapped with a sex offender conviction by now. Not that I&#039;m condoning it you cant even piss in an alleyway right?

Or to encourage people to do illegal things? Or just for child pornography? You just have a double standard is all. You apply special logic to child pornography that is not applied to anything else. How about we have a law that says you cannot encourage people to use illegal drugs. You can not say &quot;Good!&quot; when somebody has robbed a store that you think exploits its workers. Any speech that gives the impression of support for criminal behavior should be outlawed. You fucked a fish because you wanted to fuck a fish, if I look at the pictures it doesn&#039;t make the fish you fucked any more or less fucked and if you go out and fuck more fish because of it you are the one who is at fault. I did not put a fucking gun to your head and tell you to go out and fuck fish, I did not help you fuck fish, I did not pay you for photographs of you fucking fish, I am not responsible for your behavior and putting the blame on me is only reducing the blame on yourself. Saying that somebody only fucks kids because people look at the pictures is minimization of the behavior of the person who fucked a kid saying that they cannot control themselves and they are under the control of people looking at pictures. It is fucking insanity, there is no sense in it, if your logic was applied to anything else in life you would scream bloody murder about how your freedom is restricted (&quot;Oh I cannot say I think people should smoke weed? I cannot say that I smoke weed? This is fascism!&quot;). You people who argue against me have no validity to what you say, you have only mantras and emotions, you do not have science or truth on your side only baseless lies that you have repeated so much that you believe them. <br /><br />So anyway let&#039;s make a technical solution then! Really Encrypted Keyword Search seems like it is the answer to all of your complaints. You go and fuck a fish and then you tag the image with keyword &quot;fish fucker&quot; and upload it to Encrypted Keyword Search server, now someone who likes fish fucking pictures can go to a program and type in &quot;fish fucking pictures&quot; and it queries the EKS server in such a way that they can obtain your picture without the EKS server being aware of what they searched for or what picture they obtained (nor can the EKS server even determine that it had such a picture). Now the demand is hidden, you do not know if anybody downloaded your picture, the EKS server doesn&#039;t know if anybody downloaded your picture or even what your picture is. There is no demand that can be observed. Why should it be illegal for them to use a program such as to obtain files that nobody can know they obtained? It is irrelevant in any case though, because such a program would offer nearly perfect anonymity anyway so literally nobody would be able to tell that they obtained that image or what they searched for. It seems to have the added advantage of hiding this demand that you think translates directly into people running off and finding kids to fuck. So I think you have no problem with this system right?

Good luck. Even if you find such a person it makes no difference anyway. If somebody decides to rape kids because the word &quot;the&quot; is used in English, are you going to campaign that we strike the word from the dictionary? It doesn&#039;t matter why somebody else decides to rape kids. The only exception to this is in cases where you pay them to rape kids. If you pay somebody to kill people you both go to prison. If you say you think that people should be killed and it leads somebody to kill people, only they go to prison.&nbsp; If you tell somebody to kill a certain person you both go to prison if they do. If you say that you wish a certain person was dead and it leads somebody to kill them, only they go to prison. This same logic applies to all criminal activity other than child pornography related offenses. If you pay somebody to molest kids you both go to prison. If you say that you think children should be molested (what you argue is happening when people view CP, and why it should be illegal), then in some cases you both go to prison. If you tell somebody to molest a certain person, you both go to prison if they do. If you say that you wish a certain person would get molested (by looking at CP featuring them, which you claim is essentially encouraging the person to be molested again), then you both go to prison. <br /><br />The only way you can be logically consistent is to either bring your stance on deviant pornography in line with every single other thing you have belief on, or to claim that people should not be allowed to say they think any crime should be committed and to claim that you should not be allowed to say that illegal things should be allowed to happen to anybody. If you were logically consistent you would be locking up the neo nazis who talk about how they wish the Jews would be subjected to genocide again, you would be locking up the KKK members who think that blacks should be lynched again, you would be locking up the Anarchists who say they think the government should be violently overthrown, you would be locking up the people who say they wish that somebody they hate would die, etc. But you are not so illogical to say these things are you? But in the case of deviant pornography you hold people to a totally different standard and you want to police their thoughts and their beliefs rather than their actions. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your drug analogy is lost on me for the same reason because I am not harming somebody for smoking a joint.&nbsp; If you can tell me how I am maybe I will reconsider my morals.

The war on CP viewing is a multi billion dollar industry in the USA alone. You smoking weed causes no more harm to others than someone looking at CP causes. If you want to say that somebody looking at CP causes demand that is then filled with supply, I could say that you smoking weed could fund violent Mexican cartels who kill innocent people. You will say but oh that is the fault of the Mexican cartels it is not my fault! And then I will say yes just like it is not the fault of somebody who views CP that somebody else rapes children. You cannot use this stretching of responsibility on CP users without doing it on yourself. Your demand for drugs leads to violence, there is no question about it, if there was not a demand for drugs a lot of people would be a lot less victimized in the world. Do you feel the responsibility for the deaths linked to the cartels is on your shoulders? Then why do you want to try to say the responsibility for child molestation is on the shoulders of people who do not molest children? Using double standard logic is one thing but in this case you are just being hypocritical.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But anyway that&#039;s my view and I&#039;d like to move on to say I think what you propose as regard an Encrypted Keyword Search is actually a good idea in the sense that it can take away exactly the sort of egotistical part that I believe is inherent in human nature and would be all for it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sure Encrypted Keyword Search is good. But even today the P2P network CP viewers come close to this, and they are the vast majority of those arrested for CP. They do not network with each other on forums or communicate with each other, they simply type search terms into P2P programs and obtain files from them. The only real difference is that in the case of the P2P traders it is theoretically possible for somebody to notice that a CP file was searched for and downloaded, Encrypted Keyword Search can remove even this possibility. Somebody uploads a file to a set of servers and it is essentially in a knowledge black hole, nobody knows where it is anymore or if it ever comes out again.

				Fifty years ago, drug offenders were at the bottom of the European prison pecking order. The threats commonly made towards them were similar to the threats in this thread made against pedos. The lower down the chain one sees oneself, the more important it becomes to lash out at those below in order to preserve a sense of worth.<br /><br />As for the age of consent, the argument is less about what it should be, than whether one culture has the right to lay down what it should be for other cultures.<br />

This is meant to be the same guy who created tor mail right? How ironic that such a liberating tool is used for the most grotesque, heinous and deceptive crimes. I hate fucking pedos , i wish them an eternity in hell for abusing the purest innocence known to man, the child.&nbsp; But i hate LE too, and these pedos are giving us tor/SR uses a bad name. They create heat for us, like a kid robbing on your block and bringing fedz. thats what happens to us. Why dont we honest SR users do the polices job and team up to rid the world of these cunts. I got love for fellow dealers man, but fuck the pedos. we should go undecover and shit and fuck these cunts up cos they bring heat!! what u guys think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />So, you want to be a cop? <br /><br />I think it was Jacob Applebaum that said the consensus was, they don&#039;t want to introduce an element that they are trying to avoid in the first place. <br /><br />Dude, if you want to play Cops and Robbers, or Cowboys and Indians, I suggest joining the military first, and go kill innocent women and children in Afghanistan. Then, when your tour is finished, you can become a policeman. Until then, perhaps you should stick to the clearnet. <br /><br />When you host your own site, then you can pick and choose what you allow to be posted on it.&nbsp; I host a site and I don&#039;t allow any CP on it. That is MY prerogative because i own the site, thanks to the good graces of the Tor people. <br /><br />If I happen to come accross someone who is actively raping children, I&#039;ll kill him myself. But I am not, nor do I have any desire to be a cop. I&#039;ve been locked up several times and did two bids in prison. I fucking hate cops. You should too. When you say &quot;Fuck LE...&quot;, perhaps you should fuck yourself.

Even criminals look down upon them and someone needs to be at the bottom of the pecking order. If it ties up FBI resources, look at CP, by all means. Just don&#039;t expect to be able to type out an articulate reply or defense on a forum in a special housing jail unit because crackheads and other social failures plan on choking you to death with a towel or treating you like a victimized child. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Pedophiles are picked on and reviled for a reason, I cannot argue with that. The primary reason being that the media has made them equal to child molesters in the eyes of the general public, the secondary reason being that humans have a tendency to hate people who are not the same as they are, and pedophiles are a pretty small percentage of the population. The primary reason they hate ephebophiles I am not sure considering all evidence points to the majority of men being ephebophiles, probably it has something to do with the media casting such people as deviant sexual predators. In most of the world ephebophiles are not despised at all or even made into criminals, I am not sure what is so special about USA, UK and Australia that they want to play pretend. <br /><br />Sending people who look at illegal pictures to be choked to death by crackheads in prison is extremely cruel and barbaric. In the future people will look back at today and the mass hysteria and primitive thinking of our times will be studied much how we study the Salem Witch Trials and similar.
