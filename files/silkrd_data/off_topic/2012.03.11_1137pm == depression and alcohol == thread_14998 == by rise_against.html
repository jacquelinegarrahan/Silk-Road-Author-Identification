				i suffer from severe depression and i know i shouldn&#039;t be drinking anyways, but i&#039;ve noticed some alcohols will make me happy / not depressed while drinking them, while others seem to make me more depressed while drinking them. maybe its just all in my head, and it has more to do with my mood before i start drinking..... i&#039;ve also noticed that some types of alcohol leave me more depressed the day after. i&#039;m no alcohol expert, so i&#039;ve come here seeking suggestions from my fellow alcoholics.&nbsp; i&#039;ve noticed that Vodka gives me a happy and energetic buzz with only a little depression the following day.&nbsp; what other liquors would you suggest that will also give me the same happy/energetic mood that vodka gives me?

				I&#039;ll second the tequila, nothing better than a nice bottle of patron silver. If, however, you&#039;re not a tequila person, then may I suggest some nice cognac. Always puts a smile on my face!

				If I drink when I feel down it just get&#039;s worse by drinking, no matter what type of drink it happens to be, but that&#039;s just how I function. The fact that I tend do say more stupid shit while intoxicated doesn&#039;t help the day after either.

I am an ex heroin addict who sometimes smokes 0.5gr, but i have it under control togheter with my doc. It is the same meds somebody gets when they are alcoholists, at least in my country but they get an extra med and that one i don&#039;t remember. Maybe alprazolam? I have here still a box of 2mg with 4 strips, but i don&#039;t touch it if its nots neceary<br />Sorry for the bad Enlish everybody<br />Greeettzz

				1800 Tequila is pretty good stuff for the price.&nbsp; its less money than patron or don julio but great quality compared to the bottom shelf garbage....i wouldn&#039;t go near that stuff.<br /><br />I find good tequila to be quite delicious, actually, but most liquors I enjoy drinking straight up with some ice maybe.&nbsp; if you sip on (no shots, you barabarian) some good tequila you&#039;ll notice that it has a very sweet rich taste and it should go down smooth.
