				like the topic says, I need friends. I mean those friends who&#039;s willing to do drugs with me for the fuck&#039;s sake. I want to/plan on dropping some cid this week while watching &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; but I don&#039;t have anyone to drop with or even sit with me. This is depressing. I DO have a friend who&#039;s a deadhead but she&#039;s traveling out of the country for the next few months and won&#039;t be seeing her until August. That&#039;s just not enough. Almost all of my &quot;friends&quot; judge me 100% for the fact that I talk about how awesome LSD/Shrooms is. ughh. <br /><br />tl;dr. I have no friends who would do drugs with me. How did you find yours?

				I&#039;d imagine it would be harder to find friends who don&#039;t do drugs, unless you are older than say 30. Me and my friends who do drugs all went through our high school years together so naturally we were all experimenting. Maybe try going to a music festival?

				Your friend sounds awesome because the grateful dead are awesome, its too bad shes away. I found my friends by being a weed smoker in an educational institution. It just sort of happened on its own. And I&#039;ve outgrown weed since then.<br /><br />Most homeless people will hang out with you if you give them stuff, like cigarettes or drugs. And if you treat them respectfully.&nbsp; But it might be a bit much to round some up and bring them over to watch a movie. <br /><br />Sometimes you can convince friends who don&#039;t usually do drugs to try them. Or you can get high by yourself, which I know is miserable from experience.<br /><br />If you need some motivation to engage life, I would recommend reading the Will to Power by Friedrich Nietzsche, you can find it online. I find it empowering, but I&#039;d say to read it critically because parts were edited by Nazis in way which misses the point. Definitely read book one. Or try some of his other works.

				LOL thank you all. and yes. we probably should start a &quot;club&quot;. Sometimes I wish that I could post on my fb saying &quot;Dropping acid this week and watching fear and loathing, anyone wanna join?&quot; but no...I&#039;m decent and proper. I believe that psychedelic drugs should be legal with some ramifications such as an age limit or medically controlled like provided by a doctor. There&#039;s studies that shows alcoholics dosed with LSD has a better chance at sobriety than with AA meetings and therapy. I&#039;m going off on a tangent but yes. <br /><br />We all need a friend who would be accepting of everything we do otherwise, there&#039;s no reason why they should be our friend. There should be an irl anonymous club where everyone&#039;s on a first name basis and are encouraged to do our respective drugs together and share like-minded ideas/thoughts. I&#039;m glad that we have this forum so we can connect to one other even though it&#039;s via a computer screen/keyboard.

				Just go to a local dive bar on a college night, or some sort of event, based on what you like (rock concert, dance party, rave, etc.) and just talk with people there who look like they do drugs. I was out of weed once and couldn&#039;t get any from people I know, so I just went to a scummy-but-cool bar and made friends with someone who looked like they smoked, and low and behold, they sold me the best weed of my life, and I never saw them again&nbsp; :(<br /><br />If you&#039;re willing to share and have a good crazy-dectector, just meet random people.

				Here&#039;s the thing, without giving way too much information about myself, I have a disability that prevents/hinders me from communicating with others verbally and I have severe social anxiety (that only can be resolved if I have someone I know extremely well with me). This bothers me so much because I know that I&#039;m an intelligent person and totally able of having awesome time with people. It&#039;s so frustrating to sit in a room full of people and not being able to muster up enough courage to attempt communication and feel extremely lonely. Without the common ground, I wouldn&#039;t have friends at all in the first place. This is the only place that I can express my frustrations because this is an anonymous forum and most of you probably could understand where I&#039;m coming from (hopefully). <br /><br />Every time I&#039;m tripping, either on shrooms or LSD (sometimes both if one ends up being a bad trip, I take the other to make it a good one), I watch The Big Bang Theory, it makes me feel like these people on tv is my group of friends, this is where I belong. The type of characters that&#039;s being performed on BBT is the type of friends that I would love to have. Geeky, smart and fun. It sounds stupid and sad but during the trips I have, it&#039;s the best thing in the world.&nbsp;

				In the past I&#039;ve used the dating site plentyoffish.com and there was an option of setting your profile purpose/goal to &quot;hangout&quot;, &quot;long-term relationship&quot;, &quot;intimate&quot;, etc. There are a surprising number of people on these sites that are actually just interested in meeting local friends.<br /><br />I set my profile looking for &quot;hangout&quot; and met various people, of the same and opposite sex. Some led to simple friendships, and some to not-so-long relationships, but hey, I was just an asshole back then, so it was my fault. You mentioned you wanted &quot;geeky&quot; friends, and I do believe there are sites for that niche crowd as well. <br /><br />You seem like a great person and I&#039;m sure you would be a great friend if I knew you irl.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />

				I met my friends in University because we all sat on the steps and smoked outside. Luckily, it turns out we have more than that in common and it just turned out we were all interested in drugs/ were willing to gain an interest. You&#039;ll be surprised how open minded people can be concerning that sort of thing. Other shared interests are a better way to start, however the bonds formed in some drag crazed blitz to the End of the Night can be surprisingly strong.

				I am in a similar situation myself.. no good friends to get high with (i do mostly opiates). I just recently got my bf to do pills with me but he is still a little freaky about it. I dont have &#039;friends&#039; other than people at work, and I rarely hang out with them more than once a month, if that, plus they are all younger than me. Ive always been a loner and a shy, quiet person, and most people would be shocked to know the truth about me! My closest &#039;friends&#039; know i did some hard partying in the past, and a later rehab stint, but thats about it. I have a &#039;sweet little good girl&#039; personality about me... which has kept me out of alot of trouble ;) over the years...&nbsp; When i tell people about my hardcore addict and rehab days their jaws literally drop. They just cant believe it because im so &quot;cute and sweet&quot;, and seem so &#039;level headed and bright&#039;, lol. This has also kept me from finding my own local hookups.. its hard for me to talk to people in the 1st place and even if someone was dying for a customer, they&#039;d for sure think i was an undercover LEO or something.&nbsp; A blessing, but also a curse. = )<br />I feel ya.

But go outside for a smoke and everyone is talking! O have met countless people as a smoker because of this. In any situation, a smoker needs to change the scenery because of many of today&#039;s anti-smoking laws in many regions. When you go outside and stand for a smoke, there is often others there to chat up. I still go out for smokes with people because I like the whole idea of going outside for &quot;fresh air&quot;(in my case&nbsp; :P). But I definitely don&#039;t suggest taking up smoking or continue if you want to quit.

				Also in your boat; traveling has been lonely for me at times. <br /><br />A few of my friends are always itching to trip but always seem on the fringe of a bad trip while doing so. Its like they always wanna double down on their bad experiences and try again. Not sure if drugs are helping them. It also puts some stress on me during the trip.<br /><br />Anyway, this caught my eye:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17424.msg177747#msg177747">Quote from: missunshine143 on April 05, 2012, 02:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Every time I&#039;m tripping, either on shrooms or LSD (sometimes both if one ends up being a bad trip, I take the other to make it a good one), I watch The Big Bang Theory, it makes me feel like these people on tv is my group of friends, this is where I belong.

I am undecided whether making strong emotional bonds with fictional television characters will have a positive effect in life. I could see it resulting in increased social difficulties. Not to say i don&#039;t completely dive into some movies myself when i smoke weed. Guess I have never had the attention span while tripping.<br /><br />Nevertheless I feel for ya and unfortunately dont have any new suggestions for finding drug-savvy friends :(<br /><br />Happy travels!

				The way I found drug friends, is to keep your ears out, bring drugs up in topics every now and then.<br />If you hear someone talking about it, join in.<br />See if anyone knows anything about drugs, then you&#039;re most likely got someone who uses.

				Dear Miss Sun Shine, my name is Lim and I will be your mate if you would like. <br /><br />On another note, I used to be quite introverted myself when I was younger but now I&#039;m a little bit older I&#039;m the total opposite. One of the biggest contributing factors for this was my discovery of MDMA. I popped my first E when just before I turned 15 but I didn&#039;t really understand what MDMA was all about. When you are that age you do it &quot;To get buzzin&#039;&quot; and be cool but as I got a bit older and I realized that the people who took it to be cool didn&#039;t really understand what MDMA can do for you and your personal development if used correctly and in moderation. When I started to do it with a few close friends at our houses etc it showed me that it is ok to form bonds with people and express yourself and be real because ultimately every individual needs to do that it&#039;s a basic psychological need. If you think about people with social problems, particularly those that are extremely violent and unpredictable most of the time it stems from a lack of ability to express how they feel in a positive and productive way. Anyway long and the short of it is that using MD in those settings allowed me to let go of my hang ups and now I&#039;m about as extroverted as you get, maybe a bit too much sometimes! :P<br /><br />Sorry about the ramble by the way, just seemed on topic and sharing the experience! <br /><br />Lim

				thats super you dont got friends, you go high with you, cause if things go bad(i mean really) and you became junky (hope not) and you dont got &quot;normal&quot; friends , cannot get really into normal life cause all your friends are crack heads :D ...but not that i want<br /><br />Hmm know what u talkin about, but its all about you &quot;integrate&quot; was mentioned here , just its up to YOU&nbsp; (as i am older i hate personally getting to know new people, because basicaly the &quot;conversation starters&quot; are always the same: music, travel, art etc. - based on the community you are, wish could skip this phase :D ) so yea maybe its hard to connect your world with someone around you, so you must do something for it , or just &quot;fake&quot; it a little, to get some &quot;soulmate&quot;. I belive you know some community , just like here SR , where they making sessions and u see... But dont pull on it, should be natural and you see...<br />On the other hand i must said its also about luck (me personally dont want be friend with everybody´s seems cool, but he is dick actually, and can do drugs also... i can be rather &quot;alone&quot; than prettend some friend ship even i am pretty extrovert). Also got experience i got one semester(half year) at mine school where dont meet anybody who interested meextra and just hang out with regular lads which was not my cup of tea and that is pretty unluck :/ u know.

				All my friends are willing to try basically anything but the unholy trinity. So, If I say &quot;Anyone feel like watching a movie and getting blazed? I buy the smoke, you buy the pizza.?&quot; I usually have no problemo. <br /><br />However, Limetless&#039; suggestion of a pub crawl would work, too. Lol.<br /><br />Meet new people, be social.

				I&#039;m not sure if anyone suggested this but enroll in almost and community college and you will find like minded people especially depending on the subject involved (try as study of Escher or Peter Max in the arts departments). The problems of not having a psychedelic &quot;wing man&quot; can be vexing but even more so in my 50&#039;s. But I still have an available pool due to school.

				Thank you all for ever lasting support. Tahomas, I&#039;m actually in community college right now. I just applied to the state university for the fall semester but just found out that I didn&#039;t get in. I&#039;m not letting that get to me, I&#039;m taking Ballet and Film (two classes that I always wanted to take) in the fall. I&#039;m pretty excited about it. I haven&#039;t done ballet in 10 years so I feel like a little girl all over again in a tutu. <br /><br />LITTLE GIRL IN TUTU ON ACID. this will be fun.

				This site probably not best for finding friends, go out to social events where there are people of your age group and start a conversion, pretty easy. If your shy or something go somewhere where alcohol is accepted and drink, your more likely to find a drug user in that environment anyway.

				hookah hookah! I&#039;ve met some pretty cool people there and we dropped Molly before. But mind you I wasn&#039;t the one to initiate conversation with the new folk. I&#039;m such an introvert. The only reason I&#039;m into some particular drugs is because I used to be with someone who introduced me. And now I pretty much only party with my ex who is still a good friend. But whenever I want to get something and I don&#039;t know anyone I always have this huge preparation plan built up in my head to just head down to the community college and spark up random conversation. In the end it never goes through and I just sit at home.

				Ya know pipedreamz, I wish there were a name for it, and that it were a treatable condition, but I have no clue! I&#039;ve kinda come to the conclusion that it&#039;s all mental. I stay trapped in my own mind wayyy too much for my own good. I think it&#039;s just a negative effect that comes from being introverted. I feel like extroverts just find more joy and fulfillment from being around other people. I like being around people to a certain extent, but I also really dislike the majority of humanity haha. I suppose it&#039;s hard for me to find people who are genuinely worth my time that I want to get to know, because there is definitely a difference between drug buddy and friend that I can have an actual conversation with! It really just sucks pushing myself out of my comfort zone, which is what it comes down to. My comfort zone is stay away from/don&#039;t talk to people I don&#039;t know, but it feels good to actually break free of that and make a lasting connection with someone. This is a rare occurrence for me though :/<br /><br />Promethean, I do that all the time! There are so many plans I make that sound really good in my head, I just never go through with them haha.

If so I&#039;d recommend the amazing therapeutic value of using MDMA with close friends and family, it definitely helped my anxiety. MXE has done wonders for my depression too, but not everyone enjoys dissociatives so I&#039;d probably advise taking Ketamine as I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s better than MXE.

Not to mention they sort of disconnect your mind from your body, which makes it easier to sort through the different stresses going on in your life and gives you time to just ponder life for a few hours. My favorite thing about dissociatives is that they give me relief from my several medical issues, not to get too personal but I have various aches and pains on a daily basis which MXE numbs. It&#039;s only natural that I&#039;d be happier with those effects.<br /><br />Oh...and it makes music sound bloody fucking beautiful too. ;D

I think you&#039;re mistaken. I used to go to a place down in the city but it got closed like six years ago and haven&#039;t done it since. Even though I miss it. Oh wait, I lied, I did it with friends at their place but it wasn&#039;t the same. <br /><br /><br />I think it when it comes down to it it&#039;s about self esteem. I know I have real shitty self esteem. I&#039;m constantly thinking about what other people think about me. I&#039;m not a fan of downer pills. I find that when I smoke I get anxious and I even still think too much as when I&#039;m sober. Shit is ridiculous. Like some times when I would roll I&#039;d even think too much and ruin my own high.

Like actual physical symptoms that cause others to worry about what&#039;s going on with that guy. This isn&#039;t the case for me either. People with social anxiety cannot bring themselves to go out in public but rarely, and when they have to. My job involves interacting with thousands of people on a weekly basis, so I know I&#039;m not having panic attacks from social anxiety.<br /><br />The difference between work and interpersonal interactions is I feel that alot of work based interactions are to large extent, already scripted. A few dumb comments about the weather, or mention of something in the news recently. That kinda shit. I can do that flawlessly. I waited table for years.<br /><br />Promethean, that&#039;s a GREAT idea.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />while social anxiety and panic attacks go hand in hand, one doesn&#039;t exactly necessitate the other. you can have panic attacks from all sorts of other anxiety issues, not just social phobia. <br /><br />social anxiety can be about more intimate social encounters, as opposed to things like public speaking and all. idfk. im not a doctor, yet.<br /><br />EDIT: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17424.msg233730#msg233730">Quote from: pipedreamz on May 10, 2012, 06:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17424.msg233677#msg233677">Quote from: jewfro on May 10, 2012, 06:00 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">all mental conditions are potentially horseshit/don&#039;t always describe the symptoms/dont always have the same symptoms for the same conditions, etc.<br /><br />-snip-<br /><br />the lsit goes on. the truth is - it&#039;s all in our heads.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In my opinion, anybody who feels this way has never had a mental condition.<br /><br />You make an excellent point about comorbidities though, we have much to learn in the field of psychology still.<br /><br />I will give the valium a try one of these days though.
