				Yesterday i got together with two fellow musicians. My one friend being a drummer, and my other a guitarist, and myself being a bassist, we decided to reserve a jam day. I figured it would be a good idea to show up at the house with mushrooms for each member of the group, and it turned out to be the best day of my life.&nbsp; The drummer, lets call him D, took 2.0g, while the Guitarist, J, and I took 2.5g each.&nbsp; At first we walked around waiting for the shrooms to kick in, eventually we stopped at a friends house to let his dogs out while he was away, this is when we started to feel the tripping sensation rising in all of us, marveling at the miracle of nature we were experiencing around. This was just the beginning though. We climbed on the roof, and laid upside down discussing the visuals that were starting to form in the sky. It was one of the most beautiful sights any of us had ever seen. It was a beautiful day with a mostly blue sky, but the sun was peaking through a few rainclouds giving off this dreamlike mystical feel we were all overjoyed to be experiencing. Eventually we got back to the house and decided to get to jamming, what we originally came here for. We had a few small quick jams while discussed nature, philosophy, and music. We could all tell from what everyone was playing warming up, that this would be a truly psychedelic jam session. Once we really got going, it was a chaotic vortex of beautiful psychedelic noise which flowed through our souls and out of our instruments into the mystical back yard aroud us. None of us had really jammed before or knew how good each member was, and we were all constantly impressing each other the entire time. I have to say that it was the best musical experience ive ever had, the most soulful and without a doubt the most meaningful. i felt a special connection playing music with these people, something the shrooms really taught me that day. After grooving a little more we decided to hit the pool as it was pretty hot (i always bitch about being hot while tripping so it may have not actually been that hot).anyway we hung out in the pool until the sun went down and talked about the beautiful nature of the universe, and shared our beliefs in god, society, commercialism, this country, and all other things we currently experience in our lives. We were starting to come down from the trip, all constantly reminding each other that this was the best trip we&#039;ve ever taken and thanked each other numerous times. Then while in the pool still, the next door neighbor randomly launched fireworks that went directly over the pool.&nbsp; It was an amazing random chaotic light show exploding right above us. After awhile we dried off and went to smoke some ganja. All in all it was a very successful trip where everyone had fun and learned new things. I highly recommend jamming whilst using psychedelics, as it can be a truly spiritual experience that connects you with your co trippers in a way that you would never be able to conceive. Then afterwards there&#039;s a sense of camaraderie between trippers which has made us all closer and more trusting friends.<br /><br />Thanks for giving my trip report a look, the mushrooms that provided this amazing trip were from Rocker, arguably one of my favorite vendors. ;D<br /><br /><br />Shifty
