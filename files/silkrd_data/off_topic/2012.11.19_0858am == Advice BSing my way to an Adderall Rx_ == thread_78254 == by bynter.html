				First, have some background info: <br />-I live in a rural ass town with less than ten therapists, and exactly one psychiatrist, and they&#039;re all at one building. <br />-They have a record from like ten years ago of me taking the TOVA flashy box test and testing negative for ADD.&nbsp; <br />-I&#039;m under 18, and my parent thinks drugs are the collaborative work of Stan, Hitler, and Cthulu(About a year ago, when I brought up with my dad the prospect of maybe looking into a methylphenidate Rx, his responses was, &quot;Sounds a lot like meth to me!&quot; and another time when he discovered I was using caffiene pills to stay up to do homework, his response was to take away my supply of bendryl and claritin[I&#039;m dead fucking serious about that too])<br />-Nearly everything I&#039;ve told him is incredibly distorted or exaggerated(though pretty much all true), and there&#039;s no way I&#039;d actually get an ADD diagnosis if I was truthful. <br />-I&#039;ve taken quite a bit of redirected Rx Adderall, so I know exactly what I&#039;m getting. <br /><br />Now I&#039;ve been seeing this therapist(without my dad&#039;s knowledge) about &quot;seeking some help to fix the problems in my life&quot;, with the intention of getting an Adderall Rx. I&#039;ve made sure to never make eye contact with him, go off subject a lot, tell him about how i&#039;m impulsive, how I&#039;m 6 weeks behind on homework, et cetera. However, this guy has come to a conclusion that he&#039;s very convinced I don&#039;t have ADD, but that I am anxious, and therefore I overanalyze things, and so the end result is ADD symptoms. This is BAD BAD BAD BAD, and he&#039;s thinking something along the lines of a Prozec Rx, if anything at all. However, to get an Rx, he needs give me a session with the psychatrist(who I hear is very Rx-happy). But I&#039;m worried that the therapist will tell him, &quot;Anxiety, not ADD&quot; and even if he is drug happy, the drug I end up with isn&#039;t going to be Adderall. <br /><br />So I need some advice on how I can make an ADD impression on this psychatrist, and on how I can convince this therapist that I do have ADD. From what I hear, they don&#039;t want to think that you&#039;re just trying to get drugs. But since I&#039;ve been seeing this guy for a few weeks, would it be safe to say, &quot;I was doing some research and what if I tried Adderall?&quot; <br /><br />also:<br />-any thoughts on how I could try and convince my dad to not be closed minded to the idea of an Adderall Rx? Even better, is there any way I could get an Rx without my dad? Any legal loopholes or anything like that? I&#039;m able to forge his name on any documents, and I know plenty of 18+ friends who could pick up the Rxs(do pharmacies require photo ID?). <br />-What about getting a benzo Rx? I&#039;m thinking maybe after having the adderall rx for like two months, saying that sometimes i go into anxiety attacks(though I&#039;d want to avoid discontinuation of the adderall at all costs)

				Wait till you&#039;re 18 then go to your family practitioner. Your parents can&#039;t get your medical records from the doc once you&#039;re 18, and they wouldn&#039;t be able to find out. Honestly, even if you&#039;re not 18, it&#039;s unlikely they will find out. Why would they have any reason to ask your doctor?<br /><br />The longer a doctor has known you, the more likely they are to prescribe you controlled substances. Just tell them you have a really hard time focusing on things, and a friend recommended adderall. Say that you did your research on the ups and downs of it and other medications and would like to try it. Be up front about it, or the doc will be actually more suspicious, and also more likely to prescribe something like strattera. <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to give you any more advice, since I personally don&#039;t agree with taking adderall (even for those with severe ADHD) at all in childhood or adolescence.

				I just went to a doctor I normally don&#039;t see. I told her that I just moved here from another state and need to have my adderall prescription continued over into the new state (lie). She asked how many mgz I had and I was on my way with prescription in hand. I suppose I got lucky on that one.

You just have to know what you are talking about, have confidence. I had some bullshit story about how I started with concerta then ritalin and had been using adderal for the last year with great results.... Then after that prescription was up I just went to my regular doctor and had only the records from the doc who prescribed the adderall sent over, he was happy to continue the prescription.

				Stand up to your parents and the docs and tell them you want to try Adderall to see if it improves your quality of life.&nbsp; Hell tell the therapist that you get it illegally if you have to because it helps you make sense in your head.<br /><br />Once you&#039;re 18 just go to a new medical doctor and tell them that your last doctor prescribed Adderall and get a script.

				Hahaha...one Adderall script gives you Adderall scripts for the rest of your life. If I really want some addies I just make a doctor&#039;s visit and say my &quot;ADD&quot; is really bad. It&#039;s on my record so they ALWAYS do it.
