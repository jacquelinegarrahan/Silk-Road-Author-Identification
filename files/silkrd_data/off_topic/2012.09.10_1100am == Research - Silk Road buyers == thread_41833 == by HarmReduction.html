				I have been listening and reading alot of articles regarding this site, and some of the papers written which&nbsp; I believe misrepresent and assume the views of the buyers on the site. I am currently undertaking some research and I am interested in speaking to buyers from the site <br /><br />This is ANONYMOUS and no names are taken in the study. I have already spoken to a couple of buyers from the site and these people have set up a skype account which keeps their anonymity.

				Ok in fairness you guys have a point re Skype and I didnt explain this&nbsp; , the people I spoke to knew my reputation as a researcher and knew other colleagues of mine who could vouch for me.&nbsp; I would like to get as many people as possible and its important to me that you remain anonymous <br /><br />&nbsp;I have a number of publications one of the journal publications was on injecting mephedrone users (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22342322) Others are on my linkedin profile http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-bingham/16/a57/67b<br /><br />I do not need to know the country your from or your name if there are any questions you dont want to answer just leave them out.

				fuckoffehbuddy I am not a copper ....LOL&nbsp; I am interested in&nbsp; hearing from SR buyers , there is alot of media coverage about SR and in some of the media articles its been seen as this merky underworld , from those I have been in contact with alot of them are professionals who dont want to deal with street dealers and others who believe that the gear they are getting from SR is better than the street, as a person that has worked in Harm Reduction for years the SR buyers I have spoken to have said that they are reducing harm to themselves , have a look at my previous messages&nbsp; on this link and your see other research I have been involved in .The questions I can DM to anybody and they can answer the questions they want to answer

Let&#039;s be transparent.

I think someone needs to do their homework on online security before asking members to participate.

				Thanks for your comments @chrispi I have been involved in a study on bath salts / mephedrone and as it was pointed out to me its not a great idea to send a .doc which I did not know and fair enough to be pointed out to me @Ahoyhoy so i am sending the questions Via DM of tormail @fuckoffehbuddy this site is being mentioned virtually every day ...SR even has a twitter AC which has 859 followers . <br /><br />I was at a conference where SR was being mentioned alot, there is more curiosity about SR and therefore its always going to a focus of media attention, it was bloggers and chat forums that first highlighted SR and not journalists or researchers .....see latest article on SR http://www.itnews.com.au/News/315014,police-struggle-with-online-drug-networks.aspx

				WARNING WARNING WARNING<br /><br />It is INCREDIBLY easy to get somebody&#039;s IP address through skype which can inturn make it very easy to find their Location and real life credentials. <br /><br />When I used to play various MMOs, we would get our opponents on skype, get their IP addresses easily, DDOS them to cause them to lag out so we can kill them easily.<br /><br />Do NOT go on skype with anyone regarding SR or you will surly be found out!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s already easy for the average person to get ISP information based off somebodies IP address.... the things Law Enforcement could do with such information is endless. They can find out everything about you!!<br /><br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

				To all those participating or wanting to participate in this survey.<br /><br />1. If you do go ahead with Skype make sure you torify the application with Proxifier.<br />2. I just hope you are getting some compensation for wasting your time with these yo-yo&#039;s.<br /><br />Dank

				Lol, I think you guys are to harsh on the guy. Everyone made valid points here, but if you are a mod/vendor who they would want to bust in the case that this is a sting operation it would be a long shot, since those are the people who are security aware. Now, lets fill out those questionnaire&#039;s for our Irish researcher and be nice, we dont want a research paper showing that we are paranoid people (even though it might be good to be paranoid).<br /><br />-FB

It simply means that the person is accessing the .onion site through onion.to.<br />Nor is it &quot;not supposed to be there&quot;. It is supposed to be there if the user copied the address from onion.to.<br />Furthermore, accessing Silk Road via onion.to whilst using TOR will not reveal your IP address, it simply makes things load more slowly as the traffic is routed through more relays. The opposite is a security risk though; accessing Silk Road or any other .onion site through onion.to with your regular browser means that the operators of onion.to can see your IP address, and may be logging it.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Everyone made valid points here, but if you are a mod/vendor who they would want to bust in the case that this is a sting operation it would be a long shot, since those are the people who are security aware. Now, lets fill out those questionnaire&#039;s for our Irish researcher and be nice, we dont want a research paper showing that we are paranoid people (even though it might be good to be paranoid). - Thanks mate ;-)<br /><br />Just to clarify this is a study on peoples experience of buying from SR , further info on other research can be found http://independent.academia.edu/TimBingham<br /><br />Press / media articles<br />http://www.herald.ie/news/campaigners-call-for-safety-zones-to-treat-drugged-fans-3172804.html<br />http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/higher-rate-of-drug-deaths-202359.html<br />http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/does-portugal-have-the-solution-to-our-drug-epidemic-2672102.html<br />http://www.thejournal.ie/author/tim-bingham/<br /><br /><br />I dont want to keep 2 threads open on the same topic can people please post on&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=58514.0 <br /><br />Hope this clarifies everything
