				I don&#039;t think there would be too many buyers on silk road that are underage. Considering it would require some research as well as an address to send drugs too. I doubt underage buyers would ship drugs to their parent&#039;s homes.

				Thats a&nbsp; good question!<br /><br />That are underage Buyers? By Law you are underage with 21,18,16 depending on the country you are from.<br />Since we all break the Law in some ways every day, that is not relevant.<br />If you have your own money (pocket money, helping neighbours, paperboy or mining the BTC) and you can handle BTC, tor and pgp then you should be old enough to order.<br />99% of the stuff on SR is better, as you get it from your friendly local dealer, also here is a big drug safety forum to inform you.<br /><br />As a seller, if I got the feeling, that this is an inexperience Buyer (does not matter what age), I try to help him to point him to good links to read about his order and/or give him personal helpful information.<br /><br />Something to think about:<br />If I apply for my retirement fund, they will tell me I am under aged.<br />If I see girls pregnant with 13/14, I think they are under aged, but they could be a better mother then your or my mother.<br />

I know my parents never used to open my mail if it was addressed to me. They may wonder what it is, but you can make up whatever you want. Penpal sending a letter as a simple example. Hell if you were using a fake name, you could even say in advance if anything is addressed to x name it is for you from a penpal.<br /><br />Either way, since drugs are illegal anyway there is no legal age for them to be taken in any case. As a seller in person I probably wouldn&#039;t give to any kids, but anon over the net? You never know the age or ever see them, no point worrying what you can&#039;t control.

				I can tell you first hand some of us are not fully legal adults.<br /><br />But a minor in the legal sense is just an age where everyone should have matured according to the laws of science. <br />I sell the drugs I buy on here to keep myself occupied and stoned, do not underestimate the minds of your youth. <br /><br />The circumstances surrounding being able to fund and pick-up the mail have to be perfect or you risk exposure, and everyone who is trying to protect sellers, they are the last on the list. Receiving drugs through the mail is a form of drug trafficking, and endangering the public. (They don&#039;t see it how we do, of course. ) A seller will take a lot of high security clearance and a very smart tech junkie to locate him, and a very long while doing so. However if my mail gets intercepted, it is not hard at all to bust down the door to our house and charge me.<br />I have as a younger kid been on probation, and unless you have a good lawyer they will throw you under the jail, and anyone that survives like I do has no money for a lawyer. <br /><br />Have no worry guys, some kids can be pretty smart. :D

				I&#039;d like to throw my thoughts in too. In my opinion SR is a much better place for under aged buyers to get their weed, E, what ever. The whole buyers experience is much safer than being in contact with druggies who selling drugs. Buying drugs also in some countries may get teens/young adults associated with gangs! Imo if you were smart enough to get to the point you placed an order, you are enough smart to take care of your self on the same level as if you were a full grown adult. <br />Not being well educated enough of the substance you&#039;re taking is the worst thing one can do. Anyone thinking of taking or taking drugs should always be educated well of the possible side effects and risks.<br /><br />The only thing SR can do to teen drug heads is save a few lives! The stuff is pure 99% of the time if you go by trusted vendors, the forums offer a huge database of information and you don&#039;t have to deal with street dealers and people who&#039;d you normally try to avoid.<br /><br />Mrmdma over and out, now I&#039;m gonna go smoke a nice spliff&nbsp; :P ;)

				still if you buy into society&#039;s bullshit about &quot;adulthood&quot; is all crap. Once you become 18 you dont suddenly flick a switch and become ultra responsible and are suddenly able to make your own decisions. Im 17 now and i could have been making my own decisions since i was 15. Instead of giving people every &quot;privilege&quot; of being an adult on one night, why not spread it out over a few years.

				The beauty of the internet is that one&#039;s thoughts and communications are distilled into the written word and I can judge people on the content of their messages. So far I&#039;ve purchased from one vendor on my buyer account who I believe is underage in his or her country and I won&#039;t be dealing with them again. Personally I haven&#039;t suspected anyone I&#039;ve sold to is underage although I haven&#039;t been looking out for it. <br /><br />If someone is intelligent enough to use Tor, bitcoins, and especially make the smart decision to buy from me (lol) then they deserve what they can get their hands on.

				I&#039;m not going to disclose my age but what I can tell you is that there is different types of age. There is physical, actual, and psychological age. Physical age meaning the ability of your body to do certain tasks, actual age meaning your LEGAL age, and psychological age meaning the psychological capabilities of an individual. I can guarantee you there are some teenagers with mental capacities higher than that of people who are 40. Trust me, after going through multiple pharmacology and psychology courses I&#039;ve done plenty of research on this. In fact, I&#039;m fairly young myself and I&#039;ve been told I&#039;m one of the most intellectually intact and intelligent users on this site by a highly reputable vendor. Legal age has nothing to do with the capabilities of an individual. Case closed.

When you&#039;re on the streets, you&#039;re on your own.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well they can&#039;t do drugs if they don&#039;t have the connections for them can they? <br /><br />I&#039;ll admit I&#039;m a total hypocrite when it comes to this, It&#039;s a bit difficult to get what I&#039;m trying to say across as I actually agree with you for the most part but I feel what you said earlier really sums it up <br /><br />&quot;There is physical, actual, and psychological age&quot;<br /><br />people like us who had access to all types of stuff back in the day were WAY more responsible then other people in our age group so Silk Road wouldn&#039;t have made a difference either way.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is r.e the MAJORITY shouldn&#039;t have access to places like SR or be buying/selling drugs under 18...

				I&#039;m somewhat biased as I am 16 and in the U.S. However I feel that if one can find the silk road and make a purchase&nbsp; one is intelligent enough to make the decision to do whatever drug.&nbsp; Yeah weeds one thing and it&#039;s nice to get lower priced, higher quality weed here than the easy coast, but it is the harder drugs that are safer to buy here.&nbsp; I have never done or bought anything beyond weed, but I know many kids from my school who have been robbed or ripped off trying to buy coke/E/molly/shrooms.&nbsp; I know a kid who goes to the grocery store and buys caffeine pills and mushrooms then sells it as coke/molly and shrooms to kid&#039;s who don&#039;t know what to look for.&nbsp; Here with the seller reputation system you know you aren&#039;t getting ripped off, the product will be good quality and you aren&#039;t going to get robbed. <br /><br />There is the problem of where to get it shipped when one doesn&#039;t have their own house.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know too much about the law but i feel like it&#039;s a bit selfish/could potentially put one&#039;s parents at risk if one got it sent to his/her parent&#039;s house if they answer for a CD if something does go wrong, but if one is clever enough to buy a fake ID and go buy a P.O. box then one is certainly able to make the decision to do whatever drug for oneself.

				In the end if anyone wants to get high they will get high regardless of any other factor. Although I disagree with supplying anyone under 18 with drugs I do think Silk Road is the safest place for kids to buy drugs. I also believe that while waiting for the package to arrive most kids would end up researching the drug they bought and it would work out much better than if they purchased spontaneously.

				If you are underage IE- physically, mentally,spiritually developing(technically physical development peaks at age 21)... IMHO fuck off and develop.<br />If I find out Im selling to kids I am going to send a letter to your parents..<br /><br />This is coming from somebody that married and divorced his high school sweetheart very early in life and was very &quot;responsible&quot; and did very &quot;responsible&quot; things like not take drugs until the ripe ole age of 28ish.. and was able to observe from the sidelines the dark side of heavy drug use through those very close to him blah blah<br /><br />That said..as a seller on SR I dont know who I am selling to. I have made the moral decision&nbsp; to only sell&nbsp; substances that I would use myself and are confident through my own warped sense of experience, that I could take or leave anything I use with minimal physical/mental duress. Thats just me. Im soft lol<br />Sometimes I get a feeling of inexperience from buyers which is ok, I didnt drop my first pinger/exctacy till like I said, 28.. but please dont ever tell me you are under 18.<br />In fact dont ever tell any quality vendor you are underage. I maybe a little out of touch but Im hoping they tell you to &#039;fuck off kid&#039;..<br /><br />I respect that age and I also know at that age you know fuck all about things no matter how smart you are.<br />(omg i sound old) but I see a big hole in your teeny boppers attitude toward drugs as mentioned already here... If you think cannabis is a soft drug you are fucking kidding yourselves. Cannabis over opiates?? LOL<br />&nbsp;why ? opiates never fucked up my friends as much as cannabis has. You will realise this you young weed smokers. Any drug has the potential to creep up on you and fuck you over.<br /><br />Between all my drug taking friends and family we all went one of two ways. We could take drugs and have the physical/mental ability to function without or we became dependent and after awhile we may have stopped&nbsp; but the damage was already done... you cant see the damage or be aware of it but everyone else can. hence the term drug fucked, paranoid schizophrenic delusional violent mother fucka <br />Which way are you going... teeny boppers? most of you dont have a fucking clue.<br /><br />What was the question again?<br />Oh yeah if you are underage.. fuck off...

				If a 14-year-old kid actually goes to the hassle of learning about Tor, BTC and PGP encryption, finding Silk Road and placing an order... well, he&#039;s very determined to get high and you can bet your socks that he&#039;s going to get his fucking drugs, even if every vendor on this site refuses him. He&#039;ll just look elsewhere until he finds someone willing to sell.<br /><br />When I was 14, I sweet-talked a vet shop lady into selling me 6g of ketamine for &quot;my cousin&#039;s pony&quot;. It took three months of building up, but I did it - and I tripped responsibly on and off for over three years on that stuff. I sure as fuck was mature enough to handle my drugs when I was 14... and yet, I was still too immature to handle my money when I was 22. Maturity isn&#039;t a single-measure scale.

I also tried hard drugs a few times at a young age and didn&#039;t have any problems with them or get addicted. I don&#039;t particularly think that kids should use drugs (particularly hard drugs) and would suggest against it in the majority of cases, but in reality kids use drugs and if they want to get them online it is probably much better for them in the long run anyway. The reason kids who use drugs end up retards in prison is because of the people they associate themselves with, and the main reason they start to associate themselves with those sorts of people is because drug use is illegal.
