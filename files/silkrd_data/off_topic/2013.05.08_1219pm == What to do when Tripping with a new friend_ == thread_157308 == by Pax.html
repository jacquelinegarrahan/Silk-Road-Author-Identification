				So I have a new friend and she is interested in doing some magic mushrooms with me It is her first trip . She has a nice personality from the very little we have talked and I agreed to help her out . Now to my question I want to make this a memorable experience for her, but I don&#039;t want to look like an idiot,make her have a bad trip or do anything else that could jeopardize our future friendship/relationship . So any suggestion of things of fun relaxing things to do either just us or with a group of her friends while she is tripping to make this a better/great experience for her (also any tips/suggestion for my first steps into sitting or shamanism would be so helpful thank you :) )

				If your all doing it, then great, but if there is only you and her, then i wouldnt.<br /><br />Make sure you will have no interuptions, and make a nice environment.<br /><br />You wont look like an idiot, you&#039;ll both be peaking, dont give her too much, half for starters.<br /><br />Have fun. ;)

				My suggestions :)<br /><br />Make sure she is in a comfortable environment, like her house. <br /><br />Have her invite over a close friend that isn&#039;t going to trip with the two of you, but is willing to hang out in case she freaks or gets scared. A more familiar friend can help ground her.<br /><br />I think music is important, so see if she has a favorite playlist or something. <br /><br />Speak to her about using a benzo in case of a bad trip. Then have one on hand just in case.<br /><br />Good luck and have fun!

				I usually hate to have a sitter when im tripping so its best to ask the tripsitter beforehand to leave after 2 hours after dropping if everything goes well. Ive had some intense telepathy sessions getting disturbed while taking acid in a group where not everyone was on it. For the rest I think everybody else in this thread gave solid advice!

				I&#039;d advise against a trip sitter as well. I always feel uncomfortable when the sober people are asking why i&#039;m breaking my tits laughing etc. It has happened to us all i&#039;m sure!!! :)<br /><br />My suggestion would be to have a nice atmosphere, good music, few drinks and a couple of benzos in case she doesn&#039;t react well to the trip ;)<br /><br />Enjoy!

				Even if you are not into the band sober just TRY listening to some of the slow or acoustic stuff by Coheed and Cambria. I have a &quot;tripping&quot; playlist and it is mostly compiled of Coheed and Cambria, The Academy Is..., Lost Prophets, and other things of the like.&nbsp; But seriously some C&amp;C while tripping is like a whole &#039;nother drug to me, they are such a wonderful catalyst to each other it&#039;s truly mind blowing. <br /><br />Also, the only reason I would recommend a sober sitter in this case is because you two are not super close (yet ;p) and her having a close friend plus the ever recommended benzos should help if things go awry...<br /><br />Hope this helps and have fun!<br />-nameless

				Try having sex with your friend at the peak of the trip. That&#039;s one thing you can do.

				at least 3g if you tripped a fw times before and give her 2.5<br /><br />Id go with it being just you two, first timers and multiple people dont mix as well as 2-4 tops. <br /><br />keep it small, sweet and as for &#039;what to do&#039; you already made the first right choice...tripping!<br /><br />The ideas and conversation will start flowing from the mush. Ive never needed a plan for what to do, prior to tripping.

				Id say yall need to be very comfortable with each other. Being close together while tripping, cuddling and such is amazing.<br /><br />I have some friends that will only trip if the are with girls. not because they want to fuck, but because they want to be able to rub up on each other and cuddle. hangout naked ect.

				So basically No more than 2 other of her friends besides me and her. 2.5 grams should be a good dose for her. a few benzos just in case should not hurt. and I should not have to worry about conversation cause it should be in free flow (hopefully). I always suggest outside and nature as a great setting but should I push this idea or does it really matter?

				If i where you, i would do a bit less than her, so as to be able to manage her if she trips real hard, all the while keeping your self from looking like an asshole if your tripping to hard. <br /><br />Personally im not comfortable tripping balls around people that are new in my life,&nbsp; im just never able to let go and enjoy the trip.
