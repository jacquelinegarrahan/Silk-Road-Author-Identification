				1. Methamphetamine<br />2. Methamphetamine<br />3. Amphetamine<br />4. Weed<br />5. MDMA<br /><br />There really is nothing quite like a hit (or 65) of meth..... The only drug that I frequently dream about or wake up craving even after weeks of not using<br /><br />Though to be fair weed and amphetamine are much better suited to frequent use (far less damage/insanity) and MDMA induced-euphoria would probably top them all. But all round (duration, euphoria, ability to function) meth is the best!

				1. Weed/Hash. Just because I always get good high from it, no comedowns, tolerance increases slowly, and the only negative thing is that I get lazy. Oh, and my IQ probably dropped by ten in a year;D<br />2. MDMA - I love serotonin rush. First time I took it, it blew my mind. Serious downside - I can&#039;t take it more than once every two months, or I get very depressed for a long time after using it.<br />3. 4-aco-DMT - Awesomest psychedelic:) Trips give me this supreme clarity of the mind and feeling of being connected with universe. Most spiritual drug I have tried without the downsides I get from shrooms - nausea, body load, etc.<br /><br />.....<br /><br />4. Cocaine - Only best quality. I like to get social, self-confident and fun sometimes:) Too bad it&#039;s too expensive for me. Well, and I feel dirty supporting this industry...<br />5. Amphetamine - Uncut, best quality. Helps me working and socializing. It&#039;s more useful than fun for me. I hope it&#039;s just temporary thing for me.

				Shrooms, MDMA, DMT, MJ and Ketamine, because the only other drug I&#039;ve done is alcohol and I don&#039;t care for it at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard for me to put those in any particular order because they are all great in their own way for different occasions. If it weren&#039;t for the dreaded loss of magic, MDMA would be right up there with H20 and CO2 as the most important chemicals in the world. DMT is nothing short of incredible but most of the time I want to trip for 6+ hours rather than 6+ minutes. <br /><br />Drugs are simply too awesome to pick a favorite, but if I could only use one for the rest of my life it would definitely be Shrooms. It lasts a nice amount of time, tolerance disappears completely after 8-10 days, and they just turn everything into an adventure, which is invaluable when you are living a life where most days are more or less the same boring grind.

				Mine are the classics, because they&#039;ve always been there for me and really turned me into the no-fuck-giving person I am today. C:-)<br /><br />1. Marijuana<br />2. DMT<br />3. LSD<br />4. Psilocybin mushrooms<br />5. MDMA<br /><br />Other top contenders would be 5-MeO-MiPT, 4-AcO-DMT, Ketamine, 25c-NBOMe, man there are so many more that are equally amazing in unique ways. ::)

				Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve tried enough to make a top 5. I&#039;ve enjoyed...about all of my drug experiences in some way though. Weed, MDMA, Meth, Alcohol, DMT, opiates/heroin, benzos and Shrooms off the top of my head have all been really fun experiences--often in different or unique ways that make them completely separate experiences.

				Damn. Ive tried alotta new shit lately. Used to be an opiate lover, but honestly that shit has sorta phased out. Fuck it I can nod out when I am old and my heart is fucked.<br /><br />Still.... its hard as fuck to pick my number one. I guess I will name 5 in no particular order. <br /><br />Acid: Had some fucking amazing times on good clean acid. And I can still keep my shit together even when combined with a fuck ton of other drugs.<br /><br />Meth- Honestly.... idk why I like it so much. Wasnt to fond of it when I first tried it. But now I realized it was pretty fucking great. Love the taste too when smoked.<br /><br />Beer- Everyone drinks, and it gets you laid. Always will be a favorite. Atleast.<br /><br />Cocaine- Tried today. Shit felt fucking great. And I can hold my shit easy as fuck with it. Just does not last long enough for me.<br /><br />MDMA- Well... my first time rolling was last weekend, with about 200mg and 2 hits of jannis acid, 5 grams of shitty shrooms and alotta beer. it was pretty fucking great. Think its a bit overrated though.<br /><br />Coke and MDMA will probably be 4 and 5, just not sure which would be where.&nbsp; Acid probably first followed by meth, then alcohol. Fuck weed.
