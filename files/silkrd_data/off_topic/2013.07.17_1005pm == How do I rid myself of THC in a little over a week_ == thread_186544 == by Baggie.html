				I agree with cranberry juice but a better solution is to actually get cranberry pills at cvs or walgreens, they are pure cranberry where as cranberry juice is usually a lot less percent actual juice.&nbsp; In addition to that you should be working out a LOT, sweat as much as you can, use a sauna if you can.&nbsp; I am experienced with this, I am and have been on probation for years now and I smoke the day I go to probation every month, right after I take my drug test I go and get SUPER high then smoke for about 2 or 3 days then follow this regimen until my next probation meeting, Ive always been fine.&nbsp; No need to worry, just dont go smoking for more than those few days.

				IMPOSSIBLE to be clean of THC in a little over a wk. You need at LEAST 3 wks and i would recommend that you exercise hard daily to sweat it out. If you dont exercise your looking at 30-40 days for your system to be clean depending on your weight.

If you only smoked three times you should have it out of your system in 1-2 weeks tops. 2 weeks being that you&#039;re obese and completely immobile.

				all you need is to drink a lot of water everyday. eat asparagus the day before so that your piss will be dark yellow and stink when you give the sample. clear piss may result in suspicion.

				You want to drink alot of the cranberry juice throughout the next few days. The night before drink a half gallon of the cranberry juice before you go to bed. The next day drink nothing but water, and alot of it. And probably about 3 hours before your test start pounding water im talking like a gallon. That will probably take about an hour to hr and half to go through your system. You want to piss about 3 or 4 times after drinking the gallon before you take the actual test. Your piss should be as clear as water at this point. Also you are going to have to piss about every 20 minutes after the first hour of drinking the water so I hope it&#039;s not a long drive there :o The cranberry juice helps flush the thc out of your system while the water acts as a repellent for the thc molecules. thc is strange in that it is one of the only drugs that is fat soluable instead of water soluable meaning it sticks to fat cells instead of water. That&#039;s why most other drugs are out of your system in a few days because it sticks to the water and you piss it out. The thc gets stuck in your fat cells and stays around for awhile. Heavy smokers can have detectable thc levels even up to FOUR weeks after last time smoking. Light users is around 1-2 weeks. Believe me, this method works. And since the test is a month away you should be fine. Or you could always just buy a whizanator :) hope that helped.<br /><br />EDIT - read that wrong I thought OP said test was in a month not a week. This method should still work though. But like I said you can always be 100% safe and overnight yourself a whizanator.

				-Niacin<br />-Cranberry juice<br />-Alot of cardio<br />-Alot of water<br /><br />A friend of mine also found that drinking bottles of white vinegar cleaned your system quickly, but I don&#039;t think that you are that desperate considering your time spread.

				@Croskin Yes! A lot of cardio. It burns fat and the fat that gets burnt loses the thc. But no exercise the day of. I&#039;ve personally never tried the niacin method but I heard that helps as well.

				Basically what everyone said already is solid information. The only things I have to add is green tea and going to the sauna is a good way to sweat. Good luck!
