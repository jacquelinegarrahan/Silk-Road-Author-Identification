Simply there&#039;s a listing of this strain down the road and i would like to know more about this stuff before ordering.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;ll be thankful if someone can shed some light on this issue.<br />

I think people mix these things up. <br /><br />There&#039;s K2 which is a blend of plants with a chemical called JWH-018, which is a synthetic substitute to THC with a similar effect. It&#039;s very popular among teenagers and it was legal in the us until last year. Remains legal in some parts of the world.<br /><br />In the other hand. There is a dutch classic strain which is called k2 and has nothing to do with synthetic cannabis.<br /><br />Please correct me if i&#039;m wrong but that&#039;s what i could see from a quick research.

				Well.....There is K2 the Marijuana strain. And then there is K2 the synthetic cannabinoid blend(s). <br /><br />If you are talking about real weed, the answer is yes and no. All the different strains of real marijuana have subtle differences (taste, aroma, different ratios of THC/CBD/...etc) but its like being a wine connoisseur, in the end, it all gets you drunk/high.<br /><br />If you are talking about K2/spice/herbal potpourri, then the answer is: YES IT IS WAY DIFFERENT FROM MARIJUANA.<br />Herbal incense/cannabioid blends are sketchy from the start in that 99% of them wont tell you the chem whats in it (unless you buy from a blend maker are a clearnet forum) and there are literally 100s of different Research Chemical Cannabinoids in existence with more being made each day. And all of them have radically different effect profiles. Plus, Unlike marijuana, it is definitely possible to cause serious issues to your brain and body (possibly even death) by using these substances (THEY ARE CALLED RESEARCH CHEMICALS FOR A REASON)<br />you can find a lot of good info about them at the following clearnet site:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=336<br /><br />as well as these particular Posts from the same site:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=95656<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=111754<br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117873<br /><br />I hope that this answers your question.

That&#039;s excatly what i found on the web yet there seems to be some people ,who are confused about this i think mainly because k2 strain isn&#039;t that popular in the us. (i guess)<br />I&#039;m glad now that this issue has been cleared up.<br /><br />Thanks DrGonzoII i would&#039;ve given you positive karma but unfortunately i can&#039;t. To those who can please give him positive karma on my behalf. ;-)
