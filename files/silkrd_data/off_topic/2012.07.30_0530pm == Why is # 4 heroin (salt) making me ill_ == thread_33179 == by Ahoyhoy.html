				<br />A question for all you H experts; I love china white. I decided never to IV, so using # 4 enables me to insuffate to get my hit. <br /><br />I&#039;m a light user - certainly don&#039;t have a habit. I love the high, but boy oh boy do I come down hard. A couple of weeks ago I insuffated two tiny (match-head sized) piles of H over about 3 hours. It did the trick and I nodded quite nicely. Two days later, I started to feel shit - really weary and drained. I sweated at night and literally couldn&#039;t move for 4 days. It was about 6 days before I felt right again. I&#039;ve done some research on the internet and can&#039;t find mention of any similar experiences. Some of the&nbsp; accounts of people going cold turkey sound similar in some respects but it&#039;s not possible that I&#039;m going cold turkey when I don&#039;t even have a habit. I have only used the stuff 3 times to date and felt like crap after every time.<br /><br />Now here&#039;s the odd thing. I know the stuff I bought was good quality. I bought it from probably one of the most reputable H dealers on SR. In addition, I used to buy from Noriega, whose H was also top drawer and it was the same with his stuff. I think it&#039;s something to do with me. What could it be? <br /><br />Interestingly, I don&#039;t get the same problem when I use Oxys. I&#039;m right as rain after a session on Oxys. <br /><br />Does anyone else have the same problem? Any ideas what could be wrong?
