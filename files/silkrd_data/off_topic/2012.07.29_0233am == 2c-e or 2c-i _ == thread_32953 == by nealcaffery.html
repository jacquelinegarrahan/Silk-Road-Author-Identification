				Yeah. I don&#039;t have any experience with the 2c-I but I was told it was the same for the most part.. But the 2c-E I have experience with. The first time I tired it I ate 20 mg along with Flop(MXT) .. Needless to say I had a good time but the second time I tried 2c-E I snorted it.. Biggest mistake of my life!! It burnt so bad and I puked but the trip was amazing! I saw 2c-b ? what is it?

So really, I don&#039;t know what it was, but assuming it was 2c-i... yeah, no visuals. Until I had real 2c-e some nine months ago or so, I didn&#039;t actually think I could have visuals. Actually, even half-way into the 2c-e trip I was still thinking that... then all of the sudden it kicked in and fucked me over. And lasted for 12 hours. The 2c&#039;s effect me weirdly, I guess.

				2c-i = major euphoria, small body high during come up, slight visuals (increase at 20mg+)<br />2c-e = major euphoria, good body high throughout trip, amazing visuals (starts at 10mg+) <br /><br />I person prefer 2c-i as it is easier to control but 2c-e is fun nonetheless.

				I love 2c-i. <br /><br />I&#039;m always disappointed when I try to trip hard on 2c-e... I think because it&#039;s sort of reminiscent (to me at least) of LSD but it feels like sort of a half-assed acid trip to me. It&#039;s a remarkable chem at lower doses though, like 12-16mg. The headspace is beautiful. One of the few phenethylamines that I feel so spiritually in-tune on.

				2c-i will always have a special place in my heart.&nbsp; I tried 2ce twice and didn&#039;t get enough both times, that&#039;s the huge drawback to Research Chemicals, the dosages aren&#039;t cut and dry.&nbsp; After taking a massive dose of 2c-i in June, I feel I may be done with this chemical.&nbsp; I got pretty much all I can out of 2c-i.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is my trip report from the massive 2c-i trip.<br /><br />Note: I’m a 180lbs male who’s experimented with LSD, 2ci, 2ce, 2ct2, 2cb and DMT.<br /><br />So the other night three friends and I decide to have an epic trip on 2ci.&nbsp; I had taken it a handful of times before but the other three hadn’t.&nbsp; <br /><br />At 8:26 PM we ingest a pretty good amount. <br />Me – 45mgs<br />Josh - 35mgs<br />&nbsp;Girl # 1 – 25mgs<br />&nbsp;Girl # 2 – 25mgs.<br /><br />(T+ 0:45:55)<br />The visuals have started and everything looks stylized.&nbsp; The room becomes a little hazy.&nbsp; My body feels alive and full of energy.&nbsp; The four of us smoke a bowl, followed by a hookah bowl of blue mist tobacco.&nbsp; <br /><br />(T+ 1:00-:15)<br />Things aren’t feeling like the familiar 2ci trip.&nbsp; I can tell I should take more, so I take 10 more mg of powder placed under the tongue…yeah it tastes gross.<br /><br />(T+ 2:00)&nbsp; We’re all very giggily but not “tripping” like I wanted, so we decide to take a little more each.&nbsp; I take 20mg more, as does Josh, the girls take 10mg more a piece.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps we should’ve waited a little more before deciding to take this but we didn’t.&nbsp; #yolo&nbsp; <br /><br />This is where things start to break down.&nbsp; &nbsp;After literally eating the 20mg of 2ci powder, my face feels a little numb and foreign.&nbsp; I can taste the very chemically taste of 2ci and I hear the drug say to me: “Don’t fuck with me.”&nbsp; &nbsp;I realized then, I am in for a fucking trip.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />***Note: I have consumed 75-80mg+ by this point.&nbsp; <br /><br />We break out the bubbles and blow our hookah smoke through the bubble wands.&nbsp; It’s quite amazing to watch.&nbsp; Listening to music on nice Studio Headphones is like listening to music for the first time.&nbsp; <br /><br />(T+ 2:10)<br />A proper trip ensues.&nbsp; Time breaks down.&nbsp; Music becomes ubiquitous, and perfect.&nbsp; Computers are super hard to operate already, yet I don’t feel the body effects that are common with research chemicals from the 2c family.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />(T+ 2:40-3:00)<br />&nbsp;We all start to feel the waves of nausea. <br />(T+ 3:20-:45)<br />The girls will not stop talking, and talking and talking.&nbsp; <br />(T+ 3:45-:55)<br />I can’t help thinking I wouldn’t be as nauseous if these girls would shut-up.<br /><br />***Midnight and onwards there is a gap in my notes as I was so fucked up I couldn’t put a pen to paper.&nbsp; I melted into the floor multiple times and really enjoyed watching the Winamp Visualizer “Milkdrop.”&nbsp; <br /><br />Throughout the trip we did some nitrous oxide.&nbsp; Nitrous adds a weird sneaking trippy feeling to a 2ci trip.&nbsp; It’s interesting to say the least.<br /><br /><br />(T+ 4:00-15)<br />I feel good but on another level than everyone else.&nbsp; I have never been this fucked up on 2ci before.&nbsp; I don’t think I can move but when I don’t think about moving and just move out of “muscle memory” I can move.&nbsp; Any task is extremely difficult at this point in my night.&nbsp; <br /><br />(T+ 4:30-45)<br />After watching Milkdrop and smoking hookah we started to finger-paint.&nbsp; The cool paint felt so amazing on my hands and the pure amount of color that came out of the bottles of paint was utterly beautiful.&nbsp; Colors have never vibrated more than they did and it almost brought tears to my eyes how ridiculously awesome and beautiful all this color was.&nbsp; When you make a stroke on the paper, color just explodes onto the page, and then retracts and then expands and retracts.&nbsp; The painting is alive when you’re on this much 2ci.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remember having tribal war paint on my face, finger-painting whilst listening to Thievery Corporation, staring into my painting thinking these visuals are fucking amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I read somewhere else on Erowid that someone had said it (2ci) has a distinct pattern and at certain doses this pattern is projected onto everything like a watermark, if you will.&nbsp; For me it was an Octagonal orbiting shape orbiting in sync with thousands of others.&nbsp; It was almost as if you were looking through a screen door, but the screen was rotating octagons.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Around 1 am girl # 1 and I go into the shower to wash the paint off our faces.&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: I must highly recommend showering while tripping.&nbsp; Honestly it’s best to do it at the peak and be in a completely completely dark shower.&nbsp; The Open Eye Visuals are out of this world and the water feels amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone asked me if sex on 2ci was fun.&nbsp; I said “Let me put it this way, I won’t trip on 2ci without having a girl that’s dtf.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />(T+ 5:00-25)&nbsp; I am I am so nauseous, I feel like I want to throw up every other min. but of course I can’t throw up.&nbsp; Eventually I was able to throw up, twice, and let me add that I’ve never thrown up on any drug.&nbsp; This was quite an intense experience. <br /><br />(T+ 5:30-45)&nbsp; I am finally able to write down something, and things are still so crazy.&nbsp; Faces move…there are fractal patterns everywhere.&nbsp; When I close my eyes it is bright.&nbsp; Everyone is pretty talkative and its only now that I can actually join in on the conversation.&nbsp; I was pretty into my head and my trip for a while, lost in the amazing music and Milkdrop.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />All of the stimulation really pounded on my brain and at times I had a headache, like an octopus was squatting on my brain.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />(T+ 5:50-6:20)&nbsp; We go on an adventure walk/cigarette break.&nbsp; The moon is nearly full and hung enormous in the sky.&nbsp; It was quite incredible looking at the sky as I was seeing shooting stars (not really shooting stars but hallucinations of them).<br /><br />(T+ 7:45) We head to bed but it takes a little while to fall asleep.<br /><br />Because of this my high dosage I felt severely out of it for days, as did everyone else.&nbsp; I was definitely not ‘back to feeling normal’ for at least 4 days.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I get similar effects from both, with 2C-E just being more intense in terms of visuals and body high, Both have a great euphoria. I prefer 2C-E, but it&#039;s a little harder to handle. Feels like I&#039;m riding on a wave and I&#039;m really close to getting sucked under the wave, while 2C-I feels like I&#039;m riding a smaller wave and I&#039;m in control, but it leaves me wanting a little more.
