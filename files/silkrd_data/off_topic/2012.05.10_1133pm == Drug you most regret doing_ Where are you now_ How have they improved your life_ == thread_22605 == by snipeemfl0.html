				What, if any, drug experience/abuse do you wish you could just take back?<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For me, taking and abusing DXM (my first abused drug) is my worst experience. I did it 2-3 times per week for 3 weeks strait, and my grades went into the shitter. The other active ingredients also couldn&#039;t have been good for me. I even got to the point when I was paying $70/week to get 4 bottles of robosutten every week from amazon. <br /><br />Thankfully, I found the awesome silkroad, and went on to use safer substances and got more information than ever before. <br /><br />Besides that, taking 2c-e, weed (duh), MDA, MXE, MDMA, methylone, MXE (love this shit), shrooms, 25i-nBome, alochol (still is more of a thing to do just because everyone else does it, and I&#039;m damn good too), 4-MEC, and a few more I can&#039;t remember I&#039;ve never had any regrets from them. Always had a good time, and never look back and say &quot;oh fuck why did I do that&quot;<br /><br />Taking rec drugs also gave me a reason to get into shape, hit the gym, and start to diet. Lost 20 lbs in the last 2 months, and going to keep on pushing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve moved all of my drug use to the weekends now, besides the occasional smoke. Working out 4-5 days a week and good diet, haven&#039;t ate ANY junk food for 2 months, and I couldn&#039;t be happier.<br /><br /><br />Share below

				Shit 4-MMC from China. Using it every once in a while was fine, until I started selling it at school. Then my roommates and I became fiends and were doing it daily. I lost about 20 pounds in about two weeks and my grades plummeted. I ended up leaving school. I have since got back in shape, have a good job, and am taking community college classes. I still use blow and am about to try a washed 4-MMC.<br /><br />The Lesson of the story...Monkeys can&#039;t sell Bananas

				I mostly regret amphetamines... Started popping amphetamine salts for a semester of college and kept popping for about two semesters. After the first semester, I started getting heavily addicted to the new rush of energy and cognizant growth I was experiencing. Even though I had harsh hallucinations, delusions, and unrelenting paranoia; it was like I was a demigod! Then came the end of the second semester and I couldn&#039;t live without it, I was losing weight everyday, my body started having a yellow glow to it and I started getting less and less social. <br /><br />The paranoia finally got too intense, I thought the fbi was tracking me! I had to stop. Now, years later, I&#039;m finally done healing all the adverse mental and neurological damage I&#039;d experienced and am sticking to hallucinogens :) I&#039;d like to take this moment to thank BasedGod for fucking my bitch

				&nbsp;Damn this will be&nbsp; hard with out revealing to much shit about myself, so bear with me. <br /><br />&nbsp;First off, Cigarettes are the worse. I am still young but am in to my 20th year of smoking, and feel it. I&#039;ve been trying do hard and so long to stop because I have so much to live for, to no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;On to the other shit. I was a teen parent. Shitty thing, I would not want for my own.&nbsp; I had those parents who begged me to go out and do &quot;teenage&quot; shit. Little did they know I over time I was getting in to E and shit, I did this for some years alone with acid, coke and K and over drinking. Eventually I was spending weekends out. On one fateful day I met a D.J and we did a line of Meth, while hole fuck me sideways I was God. With in seconds. Safe to say that was the end of all.&nbsp; I threw my life in a drain.....&nbsp; I gave no shits about nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;This went on everyday for 7 months, then these dumb fucks showed up at my door and said the kids or stop.&nbsp; So I went out with a bang...&nbsp; 3 day techno fest and stopped in 06. <br /><br />&nbsp;I have not done shit except for smoking since, I&#039;ve added on some more minions an amazing man...&nbsp; am in a good spot. The reason I am on SR is after plenty of talking and researching (my Man is a drug newb) we have decided we would like to do K together, a one time thing. I&#039;m positive I can do it just once. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)&nbsp;

				I dont regret doing anything, but I wish I wasn&#039;t so competitive and tried testing my sanity with hallucinogens especially with what was going on in my life- I truly loved tripping but I ruined it for myself for a little- it would be nice to be able to enjoy them like i did especially for the time of my life im in- however was in a shit place mentally and pushed my limits- fucked with my head socially and thrown me into a slump with a lot of things.&nbsp; Its something thatll pass in time, but have to clear my head which blows but a beginning of a new chapter-<br />&nbsp;

				Ketamine. It&#039;s just too perfect. It&#039;s the drug I&#039;ve been looking for all my life with the perfect effects. I constantly think about being on it all day long. It&#039;s very expensive for me too and only lasts an hour so it kills my wallet.

				I used to huff duster in middle school. I was pretty knowledgeable about drugs at that age and knew that huffing shit was bad, but an elder told me that it was just nitrous and I believed him. Probably killed like 10-15 cans in the span of a year or so. I also abused ecstasy a lot in high school. Taking it every weekend, re dosing all night, rolling several days in a row.<br /><br />It&#039;s been quite a while but I sometimes wonder if I have brain damage because of this.

				Coke was the devil for me. Started off fun enough, but very quickly brought me to a very shitty&nbsp; place.

				The drug I regret doing the most was ether and it was only because it was such a horrible experience.&nbsp; I was on vacation with my parents about a decade ago.&nbsp; Was in a hot tub and some other dude came in and asked me if I smoked, naturally I said fuck yeah and we sparked up a joint.&nbsp; Next thing I know he pulls out this glass vial and starts sniffing the fumes of some liquid and asked me if i wanted some, I was just kinda like fuck it so I did it.<br /><br />I then realized that it was a huge mistake, left the hot tub and wandered around aimlessly puking all over myself.&nbsp; Ended up finding the ocean (we were camping right on the beach) and i was just drinking the salt water and puking it back up.&nbsp; After about 3 hours of wandering I finally found our camper, laid down, vomited all over the pillow, flipped it over and went to sleep.<br /><br />Needless to say the next day my parents where like &#039;someone had a few too many corona&#039;s last night&#039;.&nbsp; I was like, yeah.....musta had one too many, lol.

				I don&#039;t have too many regrets about doing drugs. <br /><br />At a music festival when i was like 17 we had some awesome MDMA we got from our friend who spins fire. I had never done coke and wanted to try it. We found some an bought it, after doing a bunch, we bought another gram coke. I regret buying that second gram, cus we were doing bumps of coke with the molly, and sure enough the loved up feeling went away. we felt great, but i didnt feel as empathetic as i wanted to off the MDMA. <br /><br />Also in high school early on when i was about 15 me and my buddy started doing eating ecstacy pills, although looking back on it I&#039;m sure many of those pills probably didn&#039;t have any MDxx in them, most were probably speed, caffeine or piperazine, or maybe a fucked up combo of all three. <br />But i was 15 so what the fuck did i know? After about two months of eating close to 3 pills a week I was fucking done with that shit. <br /><br /><br />A couple years later i started going to more shows and met some hippies who introduced me to pure MDMA crystals.

				I regret doing coke this one time. I had a ton of orders to fill and one night I was completely exhausted but I had to get these orders done so I took a 20 minute nap and when I woke up I remember my friend left me some coke to help me get wired and complete the orders so I did two keyshots and it was the most horrible feeling ever. The coke was good quality but it was just that I was completely exhausted and all it did was get my heart racing but I was still tired, the worst part was that I didn&#039;t even get any work done I just laid down and watched tv and couldn&#039;t sleep. What I&#039;ve learned is never do coke when you&#039;re tired, seriously it was shitty.
