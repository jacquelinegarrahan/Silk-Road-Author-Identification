				I have not done any drugs for a week and no psychedelics for like two or three weeks. <br />This whole time I have been preparing for an insane breakthrough on DMT.<br />So tonight I set up the vaporizer got 220 mg of pure dmt in and got ready for my first insane breakthrough. I smoked everything and of coarse I tripped hard, I saw shapes, but no breakthrough and I was still really 100% in this world. I only way 170 pounds so how in the fuck is it possible that 220mg of pure dmt doesn&#039;t effect me that much. I have smoked dmt about 30 times before this and have never been able to breakthrough and see creatures aliens or leave the planet.<br />Someone help me out here. I&#039;m thinking of smoking the last 380 mg tonight all at once and hoping for the best.<br /><br />Chaos

				Freebase or changa?<br />If you use this much there maybe somthing wrong with your vapor technique. The effects you describe happen to me with 25mg freebase.<br />A breakthrough can be achieved with 50 mg.<br />

It was strong, not as strong as this one obviously, but no breakthrough.<br />I started dmt at 30mg and have really worked my way up. 120mg was my last dose before the 220mg which was a huge jump which I assumed would put me in hyperspace.<br />I must be doing something wrong. With the sandwich method I took damaina leaf and smoked it. Then put the ashes on the bottom of the bowl, then the 100mg dmt then the ashes again. I took a match and lit the top and took a huge hit kept it in for 15 seconds then I repeated until there was almost nothing left. I even stupidly snorted the ashes with the dmt infused plant matter. <br />What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />Also I am on no medication. As I said, no drugs the whole week.<br /><br />Chaos<br />

				are you looking for a pure DMT breakthrough or just a breakthrough? If you take a hit of acid before smoking i bet 100% your gonna break and fly!<br /><br />&nbsp;The dose should be smoked as fast as possible. try to take it in one hit!<br />and hold it till you nearly choke! <br /><br />Have you tried &quot;the machine&quot;? maybe you should. it is very easy to make!<br />

				http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/The_Machine<br /><br />take a glass bottle, punch a hole on it (carefully) on the underside!<br /><br />take a piece of metal mesh (its like those metal things you wash the dishes with!) burn the shit out of it to remove everything its coated with! burn it till it smokes. (so you wont inhale the nasty shit) <br /><br />load the mesh with dmt. ( sparkle it on top and try to gently melt it into it) <br /><br />load the mesh into the neck of the bottle. <br /><br />heat it from way under. flame should not reach the mesh!<br /><br />inhale on the punched hole. smoke flies up, fills up the chamber and you can clear it in one go! <br /><br />sounds ghetto but i think its the best way to smoke. <br /><br />100 mg of dmt gave me 4 trips like the ones you had! so i think its very efficient if used properly. <br /><br />do a little search on dmt nexus if you still got questions on how to make this thing! lots of threads about it on the forums. (can be used with tor)<br /><br />for my machine i used a vinegar bottle, its about the size of a beer bottle. when i punched a hole on it the whole underside broke off and a bit of the side but i taped it with duct tape and works fine. sorry no pictures. <br /><br />edit: <br />https://mycotopia.net/forums/attachments/botanicals-cactus-misc-entheogens-psychedelics/67822d1195320961-dmt-pipe-83484machine.jpg<br /><br />this is the original article! you can see everything on the pictures. the bottle, metal mesh, the hole and how to load the pipe etc...

				you should sandwich it! put the dmt between two layers of cannabis (or another herb if you prefer) and smoke it out of a bong for maximum effect. it&#039;s simple and effective, the dmt vaporizes because the flame does not touch it. i&#039;ve introduced a few friends via this method and no one had any problems. it&#039;s by far the easiest way.

				We&#039;ve always just used a light bulb. I can rarely break through solo, it is so much easier when you have someone else work the heat &amp; hold the machine/bulby so all you have to focus on is hitting the biggest hits you&#039;ve ever hit, 4 times &amp; you&#039;ll break... Also, be ready to let go. Let it have it&#039;s way with you, don&#039;t fight it or &quot;try to breakthrough&quot;. <br /><br />Good luck.<br />
