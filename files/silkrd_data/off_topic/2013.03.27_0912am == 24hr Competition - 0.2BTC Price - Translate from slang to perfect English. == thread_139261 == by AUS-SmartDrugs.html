				SORRY NO AUSSIES - Winner&#039;s post history will be checked!<br /><br />Hello everybody - Time for some fun...<br /><br />In Australia we have rednecks but we call them &#039;yobbos&#039;. They have a very strong Australian accent and use slang words which are unique to the demographic.<br /><br />The following is a dialog between two yobbo men (and briefly a yobbo wife), there are 51 lines in total. In exactly 24 hours the competition will end and the best translation will win 0.2BTC. We understand that this is a trust thing, but trust is a beautiful thing!<br /><br />We kindly ask that NO AUSTRALIANS participate or contribute. If two translations are equally accurate, the first post will be the winner. We are looking for translations into perfect English (as civilized as possible) - for example:<br /><br />“Wanna strap up n shoot sum horse buddy?” = “Would you like to use a constricting band and inject some heroin my friend?”<br /><br />Also please keep the sentences numbered.<br /><br />Good luck and see you in 24 hours -&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />1. &quot;Pack us up a cone mate.&quot;<br />2. &quot;You gotta chop!&quot;<br />3. &quot;Got any spin?&quot;<br />4. &quot;Fuckin, this is mi last ciggie mate.&quot;<br />5. &quot;She&#039;ll be right mate, stop having a winge.&quot;<br />6. &quot;Where&#039;s mi fucken billy!&quot;<br />7. &quot;Babe!

				No one yet eh, I&#039;ll give it a go I suppose:<br /><br />1.) Good chap, would you kindly refresh the marijuana in my pipe.<br />3.) Would you happen to have a marijuana/tobacco cigarette?<br />4.) Drat! This is my last cigarette, sir.<br />5.) Please stop sobbing like a female dog, things will get better.<br />6.) I would like to know where my tobacco water pipe is located.<br />7.) My dearest gertrude, would you happen to know the location of my tobacco water pipe?<br />9.) Sweetheart, I would adore and love you forever if you were to retrieve a beer for me.<br />10.) Golly, my wife seems to be acting a bit irrational from the menstrunations happening in her knickers.<br />12.) Heavens! We seem to have lost the bowl to our water pipe!<br />15.) I highly disapprove of Julia Gillard being prime minister on the grounds that she does not have a penis!<br />16.) Ahhh, my taxpayer funded subsidy has arrived! Time to phone up my street pharmacist and peruse the streets for some ladies of the evening.<br />18.) I shall be cooking my food tonight with a barbeque.<br /><br />Could keep going, but I need to go get beer.<br /><br />Is american advertising lying to me, why is #1 not Fosters, meaning beer?&nbsp; :P <br /><br />

				Well that took longer than I expected! <br />Source: Living in the UK, working with Aussies and having mates who have spent years there.<br />I hope I did alright, I have to admit a few words threw me!<br /><br /><br />1. Could you please load me a bong, friend?<br />2. You can take on the responsibility of cutting cannabis and tobacco into a fine powder.<br />3. Do you posses any form of tobacco?<br />4. Yes, although only one cigarette <br />5. One cigarette is ample, no need for concern.<br />6. Does anyone know the location of my bong?<br />7. Beloved, have you seen my damed bong.<br />8. I am unaware of the location of your bong as I have been minding the infants today.<br />9. ok darling, could you pass me a chilled beer please?<br />10. My female partner is angry and acting in an unpredictable manner.<br />11. Are you fellows consuming bongs of mixed tobacco and cannabis?<br />12. I&#039;m very concerned about the location of the coned bowel of the bong.<br />13. It looks like we shall have to use a beer can as an improvised pipe.<br />14. Finish your beer, you wuss.<br />15. Damned Gillard.... a female Prime Minister, damned.<br />16. I received my state welfare payment today.<br />17. Indeed, how convenient.<br />18. Indeed, I shall BBQ this eve&#039;.<br />19. I assume sausages shall be cooked?<br />20. Indeed, in addition, my female significant other will be preparing mashed potatos.<br />21. I was considering visiting a brothel.<br />22. I am jealous of you, unsure you practice safe sex by wearing a condom.<br />23. No condom, no sex, it&#039;s the law.<br />24. How about cleaning yourself?<br />25. I&#039;m unsure, it depends upon the working girl.<br />26. One hasn&#039;t had access to a new vigina for an awful long time.<br />27. Do you know if the ecstasy tablets in circulation are of good quality?<br />28. Tap supplied me with some, several weeks ago, they were an acceptable quality<br />29. You are under the influence at this very moment in time!<br />30. Indeed, heavily under the influence!<br />31. I see, would you mind giving me some of said intoxicants?<br />32. Negative friend, I don&#039;t have any.<br />33. Damned heroin addicts committed theft against ourselves at the public house last evening<br />34. I believe their particular vice was methamphetamine.<br />35. Hit my head, have a look.<br />36. But we were no cowards.<br />37. Certainly, you struck one of the black fellows.<br />38. What are your plans for this afternoon?<br />39. No plans, intoxicating oneself with alcohol.<br />40. Cheap and nasty wine?<br />41. Affirmative, friend. <br />42. New Zealand are playing Australia at football.<br />43. I shall ensure to wear my swim shorts, the temperature is very high!<br />44. I whole heatedly concur <br />45. I like your filp flop style sandals<br />46. I stole them and was intercepted by the law enforcement upon my retreat<br />47. Police officers are front bottoms.<br />48. In fact, this officer was a smooth individual<br />49. Did any attractive females frequent the public house last night?<br />50. I was under the influence of six large beers so my observation skills were impaired.<br />51. You just prefer members of the same sex, you damned front bottom!<br /><br />Peace and love to you down under, it&#039;s 1am here so I&#039;m off to bed

				1. I&#039;d appreciate it if you rolled a joint for me.<br />2. You have to grind the bud.<br />3. Do you have any tobacco to mix it with?<br />4. I do, but this is my last cigarette.<br />5. Do not worry about it, it will be OK.<br />6. Where is my weed?<br />7. Sweetheart, where is my weed?<br />8. How would I know where your weed is. I have been minding the children all day.<br />9. In that case, will get me a Victoria Bitter please darling?<br />10. My girlfriend has her period, so she has been giving out to me constantly.<br />11. Do you guys have some weed to consume?<br />12. Where is the roach, I do wonder?<br />13. We will have to smoke joints.<br />14. Drink your beer, you soft person.<br />15. Ms. Gillard, I cannot believe there is a woman running the country.<br />16. I got my medical card today.<br />17. What are your plans for tonight?<br />18. Yes. I am having a barbecue tonight.<br />19. Are you going to put some burgers on the barbecue?<br />20. Yes. and my wife/girlfriend is going to make some mashedpotatoes as well.<br />21. I was going to frequent a whore house.<br />22. You lucky guy, make sure you use a condom.<br />23. No sex without a condom -&nbsp; it is the golden rule.<br />24. What if I only get a handjob?<br />25. I can&#039;t say for certain - I guess it depends on the prostitue.<br />26. I haven&#039;t been with a new female for quite some time.<br />27. Are there any good pills going around at the moment?<br />28. I got some off tap recently and they were OK.<br />29. You are high as a kite right now.<br />30. That is true. I am very high.<br />31. Good for you. Load the bowl with weed for me.<br />32. I would if I had some, but I ran out.<br />33. The native people robbed my weed last night at the pub.<br />34. No they didn&#039;t. It was meth heads that did it.<br />35. They cut my head, can you see?<br />36. But we fought back.<br />37. Yes, you really hit one of the aboriginal people hard.<br />38. What are you doing this afternoon.<br />39. Not a whole lot - going getting drunk.<br />40. Beer?<br />41. Yes.<br />42. Australian rules football - The Blacks vs The kangaroos.<br />43. I am going to put on my board shorts -&nbsp; it is a very hot day.<br />44. That is a true statement.<br />45. Nice flip flops mate.<br />46. I stole them and the police caught me running away.<br />47. Police are female genitalia.<br />48. No, this police man was a real tough piece of female genitalia.<br />49. Was there any hot girls at the bar last night?<br />50. I was too drunk to notice as I consumed six large drinks.<br />51. You are a homosexual vagina.
