				Fucking sucks because I got scammed the first time I bought an RC, but I&#039;ve bought several things on here and everything has been fine. Anyway, this might shed some light on the situation for you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; To those who are wondering wtf is going on, sit down, take a deep breath, and relax.&nbsp; I&#039;ll break it down.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 4/18/2012 at around 3 am or so IlluminationRC begun to systematically edit almost every single post he has made across the big 3 forums, replacing it with &quot;......&quot; or &quot;oink oink&quot; or &quot;I smell bacon&quot; or &quot;Funk dat shit&quot; or similar things.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; His website also went down.&nbsp; People begun to think he was scamming.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DMoTruth posts a pm VisResearch sent to him, revealing Homeland Security possibly has infiltrated EK and arrested the owner (or previous owner?) w00t.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly afterwards, the Admin/owner of this site received a message from IlluminationRC:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&quot;Folks I am sending out all pending orders and then shutting down IlluminationRC, EK has been compromised by the Department of Homeland Security, and w00t is currently in jail with a charge of conspiracy to import and distribute analogs of a controlled substance, with a bail of 1m, and he is looking at 20 years.... Please everyone exercise caution&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The next day I believe someone posts this on EK, mid-afternoon:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Dear users of Euphoric Knowledge,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is in this time of great duress we must inform you about what has been going on, and what the current site admins have been trying to cover up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Woot has indeed been arrested and is in custody. We have little faith that he will not roll on us. Here is proof of his arrest<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [img link removed due to personal info]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see, woot has been in custody since April 10. The DEA has sealed the case as an &quot;ongoing investigation&quot; which means EK is likely compromised beyond salvation. Resu and MrMike are not to be trusted, as they have been trying to cover up these allegations, even going so far as to say he would post from woot&#039;s account to reassure everyone. Their nonchalant attitude here seems to indicate his own LEO involvement, or at least a blatant disregard for the member&#039;s safety by covering up this event. They specifically requested the staff not tell anyone what had happened.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is coming from the entire moderation staff. We have convened long and hard about this. Following this post we will likely be banned.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We extend a hand of friendship to you members to reconvene with us at<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rcbay.org (EDIT: EXERCISE CAUTION HERE.&nbsp; POSSIBLE LEO/DEA INVOLVEMENT IN THIS FORUM)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a nonprofit site. Vendors do not pay to be sponsored. The domain is hosted in russia, out of the USA&#039;s jurisdiction.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In this time of great strife, we must remember to be strong. We are still a community.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We advise you to take measures to protect yourselves. Delete incrimination posts, etc<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Godspeed,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The EK Moderation team</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Every single thread on EK had it&#039;s title changed to &quot;w00t arrested&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot; shortly after the above message was posted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Within minutes after the massive post-editing stated above, the website goes down, as in completely off the net.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard from a few people who state that the Mods/Admins didn&#039;t take down the site, that it was the LEO/Homeland Security.&nbsp; The status of the database with everyone&#039;s personal info is uncertain, but my own personal opinion is that LEO has all incriminating evidence that they need already saved and taking down a forum doesn&#039;t really do much to change that fact.<br />&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 9:30 pm both TAS/UGL delete classifieds/vending section.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards TAS deletes all specific compound sub-forums as well.&nbsp; This is done by both forum&#039;s own decision as a precautionary measure, and for the safety of all vendors/members.&nbsp;
