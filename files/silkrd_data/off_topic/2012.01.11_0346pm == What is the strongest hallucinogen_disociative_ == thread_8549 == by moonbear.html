				I&#039;m looking for a drug that will make me see things that aren&#039;t there, for example a talking airplane in my living room that I can enjoy a conversation with. Not like just melting clouds, I mean something that takes you to a far off universe in the depths of your mind. Particularly obscure drugs, like this one I heard of called jimmy weed.

				Jimson Weed is Datura, and that shit is poison.<br />The alkaloids in the plant material varies so much, from one batch to the next you could take the same amount one could be an okay experience (all I have ever heard is hellish nightmares) and the next could have you in the ER gasping for your last breath.<br /><br />So if I could advise one thing, stick to drugs that are known to be OKAY.<br />Want to go to the recesses of your mind? DMT should be strong enough. If it&#039;s not, then everything else will just be a sore disappointment for you. Maybe 5-meo-DMT would be good for you.

I have had some intensely negative trips on LSD, DMT, and mushrooms, but always ride it out or overcome them without issues. <br /><br />

				A soda can?

				Not sure what dosage you tried with the DMT, but it can go veryyyyyy deep.

More hits if you want to get nice and deep with the trip. <br />If you have a scale then start at 30-50mg and work your way up.<br /><br />When I began smoking DMT it was hard to get the right dosage because after a good hit or 2 you hear the buzz, feel the energy rising through you, and it can be overwhelming.<br />Take one more hit when you reach this point and you are golden.<br /><br />I could never see DMT as disappointing anymore. The experience is so incredibly FULL. The colors, patterns, sounds, creatures, insights, all of it is truly astonishing*.<br /><br />For the mushrooms, be sure to chop them up good or make a nice tea from them to alleviate any nausea that might rise up.<br /><br />As for DXM being weak, how much of it have you tried? You can get some pretty incredible CEVs on lower doses, and with higher doses OEVs get pretty strange on DXM in my experience.<br /><br />*McKenna reference: (clearnet) hxxp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVXvLLOaI7Q

				LSD at high doses can get you where you want to go. Around 300 mics(actual, not advertised) would have a normal person tripping balls and seeing definite visuals. Some individuals can naturally tolerate more obviously but that&#039;s a good starting point to see some eye opening stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just tread lightly because not everyone can deal with what LSD does. I&#039;ve seen people wig out off of low doses just because they were naturally wound too tight. <br /><br />

If you really want to go as &quot;out there&quot; as you say, then it seems like mixing drugs would be your best bet. Just know what you&#039;re mixing and that they don&#039;t interact in a bad way. Just think up something ridiculous that most people would consider way too much. Heavy acid/shroom trip or both, why not? Snort a bunch of ketamine which I believe takes a minute or two to hit you. Smoke enough DMT to breakthrough (i&#039;d recommend looking up &quot;the machine&quot;, what you described sounded like you just weren&#039;t doing it right) and if you still can inhale some nitrous. If that doesn&#039;t shoot you far enough out of this world then I don&#039;t know what will.

I eyeballed about 25 mg but when it melted most of it fell onto the bottom of the can. It definitely gave me a weird expierence, I stared at my reflection and felt like the being staring back at me was part of me looking back at me - like my alter ego or something , I don&#039;t know. I need to try more in a better pipe. I can&#039;t wait to try it with a big dose of shrooms - should be amazing.<br />As for DXM, I don&#039;t know how much I did exactly. Two family size bottles of delsym and a pack of the delsym pills and I was blasted off, but not the right kind of blasted off, you know? I wonder how my liver even survived that shit. I&#039;m lucky I didn&#039;t have to go to the hospital.

				I believe a few vendors are carrying pure DXM pills now that should be a lot easier on the body.<br /><br />And from what you describe it sounds like you had a very low level dose of DMT so I wouldn&#039;t lose hope.

				Have you considered salvia? It is pretty powerful, and legal in some states still. It&#039;s main active chemical (Salvinorin A) is the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen.<br /><br />5-MeO-DMT or regular (N,N-DMT) are both very powerful as well, like salvia they can put you in a different world. After the breakthrough some effects linger for about an hour or so, feeling almost like a small LSD trip (I have nothing else to compare it to but a weak LSD trip).<br /><br />2C-T-2 (and 2C-T-7) is (are) pretty cool, cartoon like visuals in some reports, some other 2C drugs are also pretty interesting including their nBOME counterparts that are in some cases far more potent. ETH-LAD is an analogue of LSD and is more powerful (ug for ug), so I feel it may be worth mentioning.<br /><br />And for LSD, it is very powerful, and it takes so much to OD you could take a whole sheet without putting your health in danger (from dosing, I can&#039;t speak for possible emotional damage or self-caused injury.) That would probably be a very powerful experience, I&#039;d believe more powerful than DMT (N,N or 5-MeO), if you were able to get a thumb print even more so.<br /><br />Datura sounds very fucked up to me, I&#039;d give it a small dose try because it is very powerful, if you&#039;re just looking for amazing power that is. Same with nutmeg, I never hear good trip reports about these 2, people always end up naked knocking on random people&#039;s doors it seems like.<br /><br />All in all, I&#039;d say DMT is the most powerful per price, dose, and availability. Its pretty cheap, easily available, and you wouldn&#039;t have to consume alot of it for desired effects. I&#039;m sure there are some research chemicals that would blow our minds away (which I&#039;d love to try if we&#039;ve got anybody sitting on small amounts of these), but when adjusted for availabilty and pricing I&#039;d say go with 5-MeO-DMT (or if you want something a bit lighter, go N,N-DMT).

				You could take a deliriant like fly agaric mushrooms, or deadly nightshade.&nbsp; Both are incredibly toxic and need to be prepared correctly. Both will take you to realities that shouldn&#039;t be visited.<br /><br />As someone already said, 5-meo-DMT is a good bet if you want an incredibly potent hallucinogen that will take you to places you&#039;ve never seen before for an hour or so.<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot safer than the Jimson Weed type deliriants.
