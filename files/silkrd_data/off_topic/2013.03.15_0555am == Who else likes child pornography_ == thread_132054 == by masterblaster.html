				This is a fucking troll thread, and yeah, fuck you masterblaster.<br /><br />But it does raise a serious question. In reality, it&#039;s not really their fault that they are attracted to children. Like other deviant sexual preferences, it&#039;s not a choice. We can&#039;t kill them (like so many people suggest), because it&#039;s morally indefensible. That&#039;d be like killing homosexuals. A lot of parallels can be drawn between the two, but there is one major difference: homosexuals have sex with other homo- or bisexuals with mutual consent. Pedophiles do not have that option - no child can consent to sex.<br /><br />We can&#039;t &#039;cure&#039; them either. Psychiatry have tried, but has come to the conclusion that sexual preferences cannot be altered. We used to sterilize sexual deviants either medicinally or surgically, because it removes sexual desire - but it comes at a high price, with serious side effects, which could be considered torture. Hence this practice has died out in most of the modern world.<br /><br />In Germany, a hotline was created for pedophiles, where they could call to get counseling on how to deal with their urges - the hotline was overwhelmed with calls. There are many out there, and most of them never hurt any children, but live in terrible agony and shame because of something they don&#039;t want and didn&#039;t choose, but is hardwired into their sick little brain.<br /><br />So that leaves the question: What the hell do we do with pedophiles?

Pretty much answers NorthSouth&#039;s question right there.<br /><br />Of course, I&#039;ve always wanted to see a kind of gladiatorial system in place for the worst of offenders. Pedophiles, Rapists, and Serial Murderers (Maybe bankers) would face off in a ring. If they win, they continue living (At least until their next match), if they lose - they&#039;re dead. People would pay for it, sponsor fighters, bet on it - it&#039;d be a whole bucket of bloody fun. To give them something to fight for, if they win something like 50 fights then their death sentence is removed and they get a bigger cell with a better bed until they die of natural causes. No waiting in a cell for 30 years to get the chair someday long after people lost all their give a fuck.<br /><br />Hell, there could even be theme fights. The possibilities are endless!

				Child pornography is wrong. Don&#039;t allow your sexuality to poison your soul. Stop exposing yourself to child pornography. Stop masturbating. Even if you are not involved in the production of child pornography, getting off on it is extremely bad karma. You will go to hell. I don&#039;t wish it upon you, but it will happen, if you continue.

If you think science presupposes materialism, then you are subscribing to an antiquated view of science.<br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t even mention the fact that I am trained as a scientist.

I am not a Christian, in any case, but I have a tremendous&nbsp; admiration for the personality and teachings of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />(Incidentally, the incidence of child molestation among priests is roughly equal to that of school teachers and psychiatrists. It does not appear that priests have a higher proclivity to this activity than members of other professions that deal with children. But I don&#039;t defend organised religion in any case.)<br />

				The fact that 10 year old girls today dress like 25 year old sluts doesn&#039;t help the paedos either.<br /><br />This comes down to a lack of discipline from parents towards their children.<br /><br />Which comes down to not wanting to look like a bad parent in front of others.<br /><br />Which comes down to the religious term - Vanity - excessive self-regard and/or overblown pride.

				I honestly kind of doubt this dude is actually into child porn. If he really was, he probably wouldn&#039;t start a thread like this. Then again he very may well be a pedo, but I just think he&#039;s trolling. Either way, he obviously gets a rise from pissing people off, and because of that, I think he&#039;s an asshole regardless of whether or not he gets off on seeing little kids naked.

It seems to me like it is pretty much natural for males to be attracted to anyone who is post pubescent, certainly to be attracted to people who are illegal in all of the USA, but recent artificial cultural shaping has caused most people to suppress this natural tendency, in the USA in particular to what can only be described by a rational human as a pathological degree.

Lots of CP has abuse in production really, to different degrees of course, the only CP I think has no abuse aspect is a lot of jailbait anyway. The thing you do that is irrational is you equate producers to consumers, it is like your hate of them is too big to contain and you let it spill over to others. The people who look at a picture of the worst CP, they are not the ones who hurt anybody. Put the blame where it belongs on the people doing the bad things, when you put the blame for them onto others you make it seem like they are not as bad as they are while making others seem much worse than they are.

				Any fuck who enjoys CP (and I don&#039;t mean 17 yr. old chicks, I mean 8-10 yr olds jerking off some fuck) should be done like the Jesus character in &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;, and then while they&#039;re hanging on a cross, sprayed down with a vinegar &amp; salt solution. In the past when I worked at a PC repair shop, we found a lot (20%) of CP on this guy&#039;s computer. We at that shop had high respect for privacy, much like a doctor &amp; patient privacy, but we almost called the cops on this scunbag. We elected not to as none of the pics that we saw were modern, none showed him getting sucked off by a pre-puberty kid. So we figured he was a sick fuck who had a sick (in the bad way) collection of shit. But we did think long &amp; hard (no pun meant) about reporting this fuck.

				Here&#039;s what I sort of figure: child(and I mean CHILD) porn should be legal to distribute, punishable by death to film. that way, it&#039;ll be easier to track down child porn studios. Also, existing child porn will be easier to find archives of, and since it&#039;ll be easier to access, child porn studios will no longer be offering a rare, lucrative commodity. Additionally, viewers of child porn will be able to easier fulfill their fantasies. Children wont have to be harmed, since there is already currently enough child porn in existence to satisfy all the pedos. The damage has been done, might as well make use of what came of it. You might not agree with the methods by which the knowledge was gained, but regardless of how you feel, nearly all of humanity&#039;s scientific data of the effects of extremely cold temperatures on the human body(knowledge which has been applied to be very useful and save many lives) was learned from Nazi experiments. <br /><br />An agreement can be made that to view the child porn, they sacrifice some of their privacy so that whatever authority figure is in place can better keep tabs on them, and ensure they dont take their fetish to the next level. and since their fetish will no longer be so taboo, they might be more willing to come out about it, so as to be embraced by a government that responds, not with persecution, but with mental health &amp; counseling services. To go one more level further of exchanging pragmatism for ethics, an initiative could be set up, so as to observe just how traumatizing sexual acts actually are on children, and learn ways in which those acts could be carried out so as to mitigate the trauma, and ways which would be most effective in post-child-sex-abuse years to learn the most effective trauma-negating counseling methods. You of course wouldn&#039;t be able to completely make up(from an ethical standpoint) for subjecting children to such things, but sums of money that ensure a high uality of life in their later years would of course help. Im not actually advocating this, but it&#039;s a fact that the world is gradually becoming more progressive, and such a concept might not seem so unreasonable to people in the future.

				As far as the ethics of jailbait are concerned, if a 15 year old has C-cup titties, theres notning wrong with fapping to it. <br /><br />If jailbait was made legal, would it be easier for porn studios to manipulate emotionally unstable teenagers not mature of to make decisions rationally, especially at a point in their lives where they are financially unstable? Sure, but that&#039;s the issue you tackle; dont ban jailbait as a whole. If drunk driving is dangerous, then outlaw it specifically, instead of all banning all consumption of ethanol. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve gotten a blowjob from a 14-year old before. Was I more &quot;mentally capable of rationality&quot; of her, and thus, &quot;manipulating her emotions and taking advantage of her reduced ability to make judgements and her sexual insecurity in the face of&nbsp; being pressured into doing so&quot; by making out with her and realizing she&#039;d let the situation go to the &quot;next level&quot;? Well, I was going to say &quot;no&quot;, but I realized after writing that sentence out that it was more accurate than I initially intended. But nonetheless, she still made the decision. and as far as nature is concerned, she was of sexual maturity. and I guess I could also bring up how the ethics of sexuality are arbitrary. <br /><br /><br />Besides all that, distribution of jailbait wouldnt be contingent upon a a soley-concerned-with-profit porn studio for distribution, and the combination of iPhones, bathroom mirrors, and boyfriends a grade-level above making reQuests&nbsp; has proven. <br /><br />

The solution is to make it so sex offenses that are REAL are severely punished, and be libertarian as fuck about everything else. It just fits in with the general theme of nobody being able to bitch about a libertarian world really. Legalize CP possession and distribution, lower age of consent to 14, take the people who pissed in the street off the sex offender lists. Now the remaining people on sex offender lists are actually sick fucks who have done serious harm to people, there is no more controversy to be had, they should be punished severely and strict laws against anything else. All this punishing people for bullshit because of moral panties being in a bunch is ruining the entire fucking world, I am so sick of it. People need to get over their fucking issues already, it is okay, we can be free omg !! We do not need to feel bad about our human nature. I think that religion and the government must have seriously warped the minds of god damn nearly everybody on this planet, we are afraid and ashamed of sex we are afraid and ashamed of drug use. We have no tolerance for people who do things we find disgusting even if they are not hurting anybody. In my mind it is no different to want to castrate somebody for looking at CP than it is to want to beat up some gay people. If CP looker rapes a child then it is justified, if gay person rapes a man / woman it is justified. Otherwise they cause no harm leave them the fuck alone and mind your own business. People say omg omg omg pedophiles rape children we must punish CP viewers. Why not say omg omg omg men rape women let&#039;s punish porn viewers. They mix shit up so much it makes me nauseated to see their logic. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">An agreement can be made that to view the child porn, they sacrifice some of their privacy so that whatever authority figure is in place can better keep tabs on them, and ensure they dont take their fetish to the next level. and since their fetish will no longer be so taboo, they might be more willing to come out about it, so as to be embraced by a government that responds, not with persecution, but with mental health &amp; counseling services. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t like idea of government monitoring people who have not hurt anybody.

They also say this will lower market value for child prostitution and lead to less adults using coercion to make children prostitute themselves, as they will not be able to make as much money from it.&nbsp; I....don&#039;t really care about this.

With the popularity of Bitcoin it is possible some are starting to charge for access, but honestly I doubt it. Yes what you describe is a thing, but most CP is distributed freely on public P2P networks, Tor Hidden Services and of course Freenet is probably the biggest cache of CP in the world from what I gather (though I have heard Lolita City on freedom hosting may actually have more. I really don&#039;t know, not interested in real CP myself so have not done an in depth comparison between Tor and Freenet hidden services). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I dont know if it&#039;s just about youth and fertility, or maybe something more.

I found 14 year old girls attractive when I was 14 and guess I just never stopped. I rather not say my age, but am still considered fairly young myself, although a good bit older than you. Why would my perception of who is attractive change, nothing about them has changed. I didn&#039;t find ten year old girls attractive when I was ten and still to this day do not. Seems pretty normal to me. I don&#039;t feel exclusively attracted to teenagers by any means, although I do find them particularly attractive. Like a 20 year old girl I would rate an 8 I would probably have a 10 if she was a handful of years younger, but that isn&#039;t to say I don&#039;t find any 20 year old to rate as highly. There is just some extra beauty in youth (not youth as in 12 year old, fwiw) that fades away pretty quickly after 17, but it is only something extra not beauty in itself. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Apparently, the self-driven enterprises of self-employed cam whores is also one of the results of teen nudity that is considered negative.

				Allowing child pornography encourages abuse. It may be free, but abusers are encouraged to produce pornographic material by the respect they earn from other pedophiles in the forums in which they distribute their material.<br /><br />For example, a pedophile might start start a thread entitled &#039;My 5 Year Old Daughter&#039;.

My own personal theory is that most men are probably ephebephiles though.
