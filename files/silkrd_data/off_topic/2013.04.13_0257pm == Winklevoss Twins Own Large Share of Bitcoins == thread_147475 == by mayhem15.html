				The Winklevoss twins portrayed in the Social Network movie have come out saying they own a large portion of Bitcoins.<br /><br />Clearnet Warning!!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; http://money.msn.com/now/post.aspx?post=3a9c9d6f-51f4-4611-90e6-b8f1d7a388de&amp;ocid=ansmony11<br /><br />If the article is true then these guys own about 1% of all bitcoins made.

I think &#039;going public&#039; with the position just makes them bigger targets to get hacked and have the BTC stolen.

				That would be interesting to see. Highly doubtful that these guys would go public without having any idea that they might be targets.

				That was an interesting read. What do you think about this man&#039;s take on the coin market?<br /><br />This mans insights seem to me to be an earnest attempt to assess&nbsp; the state of the btc market. <br /><br />At first he says that bitcoin is a &quot;barbie currency&quot; and that &quot;its the same kind of currency you get from blasting aliens in a video game.&quot; It kind of sounds like he is putting it down at first, making bitcoin seem silly and frivolous. BUT...<br /><br />Then he goes to say that once something hits a billion dollar market cap that it is &quot;here to stay&quot; and he was in the process of allocating 2-3% of his investment portfolio to this supposed alien video game barbie currency. ;) For a guy like that,&nbsp; probably 2-3% is a fair amount.<br /><br />http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Business/ID/2375415659/<br />

				Somebody was claiming that VCs aren&#039;t buying into bitcoin.<br /><br />Obviously some of them are, although it may not be to the tune of millions of dollars like these guys.<br />

				Ha! <br /><br />It is just interesting to see people from different branches of life looking into this alternative currency. It really shows me that Bitcoin has the potential to be something more than just a fad.

				I&#039;m not a conspiracy theorist, but I find it suspicious the Winklevii came out as backers of btc shortly after the crash, a crash in which, according to them, they bought up many more coins. These guys are totally the sort to fund some hacker connection&#039;s DDOS op against Mt. Gox in an effort to drive down the price in the short-term, make off like bandits in the long.
