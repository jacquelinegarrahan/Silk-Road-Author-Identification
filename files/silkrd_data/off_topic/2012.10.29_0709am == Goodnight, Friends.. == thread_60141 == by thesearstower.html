				If you should find yourself smoking a cigarette at then end of a speed run, and if you&#039;ve gone outside to smoke said cigarette, and once outside you notice two people sitting in a parked car outside of your house, you will not worry. When the wine has calmed you, and when the small pill has calmed you further, you will realize that there are not actually people in that car, and you will say, &quot;Searstower, your brain is playing tricks on you.&quot;. And you will relax. And you will smoke your cigarette to the filter. And you will see something out of the corner of your eye. And you will relax. And you will once again see people in the car, but you will not fall for your brain&#039;s trickery, as you have fallen for it so many times before.. Instead, you wil,l approach the car, and you will peer in the window. And when you peer closely into the car&nbsp; window, you will see a man with closed eyes. And in his lap you will see a woman. That woman you do not know.. Neither of them see you. When you fall asleep, it happens quickly, and you do not dream.

				&quot;Of all the separate realities, legal landscapes, and metabolic metropolis<br />that thrive beneath the surface of the Cleaver&#039;s USA, no subculture seems<br />as pervasive or uniform as the nationwide-eyed, high dosage<br />methamphetamine club.<br />&nbsp; This group is a tribute to the idea that some things stay the same<br />across time or space... the members come and go, some leave quietly, some<br />go snitch, croak, or disappear, some hang in there after their lights<br />have gone out, and quite a few are dragged off at 6:00 a.m. Friday<br />morning by blue windbreakers with yellow writing.<br />&nbsp; Getting in too deep is what we do, it&#039;s who we are.<br />&nbsp; But despite all this, there are a few of us who have managed to hang<br />around the periphery for decades, avoiding the felonies, gunshots, big<br />ripoffs, and crippling motorcycle accidents. Other than luck, the key to<br />staying alive is knowing when to take a step back, on your own, and avoid<br />the biggest bear-trap in the speed circus: taking yourself too<br />seriously...<br />&nbsp; Truly not giving a fuck is the only way to maintain perspective. In<br />other words, there are worse things that can happen, than having to lay<br />down and go to sleep for a week... no drug or state of mind is worth<br />dying for, killing for, or doing hard time for...&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Tweak on, mah brother.

				I don&#039;t know what some of you guys are talking about; people don&#039;t use the second person singular form near enough. OP, thoroughly enjoyed, would read again.
