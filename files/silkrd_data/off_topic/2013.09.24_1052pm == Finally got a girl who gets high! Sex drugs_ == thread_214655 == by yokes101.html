				OK I have finally found a girl I like who also takes drugs and I&#039;m loving it!<br />She is nice and fun. I want to do some thing special sexually.<br /><br />I was thinking 200mg of MDMA and some viagra. But my blood pressure is a little high!<br />Or I have heard good thing about moxy...?<br /><br />Whats your favorite drugs for mutually satisfying sex and why?

				You set on having sex? MDMA and sometimes coke can be sexy, intimate drugs but the stimulants can fuck with your ability to rise to the occasion. I wouldn&#039;t go the viagra route -- that can fuck even people with healthy HR/BP. I typically avoid or low-dose any stimulants but they&#039;re much better game for the ladies.<br /><br />Psychedelics can be fun: my favorite was 2c-b with LSD up there too -- good for some emotional(and physical) connecting. <br /><br />Opiates can be nice (for the guy) if you want to make sure you have the stamina of ten men.<br />Benzos are a more 50/50 subject -- sometimes it&#039;s nice to help let go a little bit and sometimes it can make people irritable or just disinterested (I haven&#039;t typically experienced those last two but I&#039;ve heard it happens).<br /><br />Weed isn&#039;t one I&#039;m big on but it can be a good one too for getting into the mood.<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m saying pretty much every drug is great for sex! :P

				MDMA eh? Maybe will not not be able, or will not be in the mood for sex during mdma.<br /><br />My sex drugs choices would be weed and lsd. Gives you a very nice and sensual beginning and then you both become beasts during sex. :)

Sex is god damn mind blowing. You&#039;d think that since H would seem like a pain killer you&#039;d be less sensitive but damn it intensifies things for me. <br /><br />I tried 2c-i and it seemed like it would be very good for sex too. Sensual but not overly psychedelic and it has a speedy edge to it that makes it seem like you could last forever like some people on straight ICE meth can do.

Check this Playboy&#039;s story: Sex on the Edge (https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dipt/5meo_dipt_article1.shtml).<br /><br />Also - 2C-B (or so I&#039;ve heard, didn&#039;t try sex on it yet). For me - MDMA worked great. Without any supplementation. But from what I read, it actually makes it more difficult for some. Try.

				Speed/MDMA would be a good choice in my eyes (as a guy I&#039;d take a relatively low dose though otherwise u won&#039;t get that snake up xD)<br />Low-intermediate doses of lsd should work as well (at least it has always worked for me)<br />This might sound boring now but wine can get you going as well (in case that wasn&#039;t clear already^^)<br />Coke should be just fine as well but once again don&#039;t take too much... it&#039;s the same story with all stimulants rly
