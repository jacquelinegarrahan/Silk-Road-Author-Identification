				what&#039;s up with people leaving a 1 out of 5 when they receive a refund? i just don&#039;t get this. Nearly every seller I&#039;ve ever looked at on SR has a refund policy. this policy is usually clearly displayed on the seller profile and sometimes on the actual item page. by ordering something, are you not entering into an agreement with the seller and the rules he has displayed on his page? if your package never comes but the seller gives you a refund, how can you seriously give a 1, or even a 2! Is he not fulfilling what he laid out in the profile? Jesus christ people, this is not amazon. the very nature of what is being sold on here requires maturity, understanding, and a little bit of flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;to new buyers reading this: take my word for it, sometimes shit just doesn&#039;t come in. it happens. you send it to resolution, get what you can, and try again some other time. dont fuck up a vendor&#039;s ratings just because you&#039;re a little pissy. if you can&#039;t handle that, please do not order from us<br /><br />best<br />-sittis

				I agree, it is absolutely crazy to give a vendor a poor rating when they give you a full refund. HELL even a partial refund should receive a high rating. The vendor has lost the product, and the money that they were owed...and people will still give them a shit rating. Come on fellow buyers, they are taking the double hit while you get off scott free!
