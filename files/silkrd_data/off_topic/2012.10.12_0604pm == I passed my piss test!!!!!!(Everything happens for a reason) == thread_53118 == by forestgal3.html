				Long story short...chronic pain sufferer here.Doctor is more concerned about addiction and his own back than about me suffering my ass off everyday. :-\<br />So along comes my little pal SilkRoad(yay I get my life back, working,chores etc ;D)<br />A package does&#039;nt end up being delivered and I have to rely on the piss poor meds I usually get.<br />Cue random drug test! and...................................<br />I&#039;m in the fucking clear.....after using #4 and hydromorphone days before test.<br />YES!!!! Now he is actually considering upping my meds.<br />Guess I won&#039;t be around Silkroad as much now?Naw I still have to figure Pgp out. :D<br />Anyways I hope everyone has an awesome weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				Yeah it does. I&#039;m super skinny so i&#039;m sure that helps. Also, I&#039;m a weekend user so I don&#039;t have a huge build up of stuff.<br /><br />Has anyone tried the condom(full of clean piss) thing? I get tested every couple months and I&#039;ve prepared the condom thing but I&#039;ve never had to use it.

				A few years ago I had to undergo a medical examination (including a piss test) for military service. Of course I didn&#039;t want to do military service so the day before the examination I had an epic drug party with my friends. We smoked outrageous amounts of weed, I took amphetamine and I downed a bottle of codeine-based cough syrup (codeine is metabolized into morphine so I figured it would make the test positive for opiates).<br />The next day I looked like a zombie (because of the codeine I suppose) and when the doctor asked me if I was taking drugs I said yes, weed, speed and morphine. Then they tested my piss but the test came out negative and the doctor asked me why I was lying to her about taking drugs so I demanded another test to be made but it came out negative again. I was lucky to have some allergies and ADD because that was enough for me to be mustered out :D<br />My body seems to magically absorb all kinds of drug metabolites ;D
