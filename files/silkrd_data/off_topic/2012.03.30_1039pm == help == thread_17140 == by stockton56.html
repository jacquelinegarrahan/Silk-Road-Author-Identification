				i want to kill myself. im totally ok with it and would have a long time ago if not for my family. idk what to do. i dont even talk to them or live in the same state but i know it would devestate them. im simply not selfish enough. sometimes i think theyre the selfish ones because we dont even get along. but i know thats just rationalizing. i have no friends nor prospects of making any. i often contemplate using/od&#039;ing on heroin. been sad elementary school and anti depressants dont change the fact that i have no friends. im addicted to drugs and i just need to vent anonymously because i guess theres not much advice anyone can provide.

				Depression is a illness and when you want to commit suicide its a sign you ought to talk to someone.<br /><br />Drugs are not good right now. Depends what you use but for the main part touching yayo or coke for depression is silly. Some drugs might work - the ketamine situation is such that its actually used in trials to help depression. Read up on some report on the other forum which details someone using K for depression once a week.<br /><br />Some drugs can isolate yourself from family and when your not thinking straight maybe you fall out with some people. <br /><br />Best to sort out your addiction which is going to impact on depression as its a vicious circle with some drugs.<br /><br />People ought to be sympathetic but there are better forums to seek help out there for depression. <br /><br />Do ask for help and don&#039;t keep things in. Talk to people you know and trust. Or rebuild your life so its one were you have people to trust. With some drugs such as coke or heroin, E or speed, it can help depression but the comedown is too much for anyone prone to depression. You get addicted and that&#039;s one more reason to be down.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Seriously, heroin, ketamine, valium (...) won&#039;t help you solve your problems. I don&#039;t want to say they&#039;re bad (used valium some times myself), but they won&#039;t lead you to a solution. If you want to face and solve your problems, try LSA, LSD, psilocybin (...). But you really have to want it. They WILL NOT help you to forget your problems, but they will help you to find a solution.
