				Some New Age people believe that the date marks the start of time in which Earth and its inhabitants may undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 may mark the beginning of a new era... So a rebirth doesn&#039;t necessarily means a physical rebirth, but a spiritual rebirth.

				I&#039;d like some of those Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs to go out. They stopped making them in the early 90s, revived recently, and now I&#039;ve lost them again :( . They&#039;re popcorn coated in honey and caramel. Taste like sin. I&#039;ll accidentally-on-purpose spill a load of coke all over them first, tell my parents what a shitty job they did raising me, and take the bag with me to the top of a cliff (not too big, I don&#039;t want to walk that far). But knowing my luck I probably won&#039;t be able to find any (bliss bombs).

You don&#039;t have to think about the end of the world and you don&#039;t have to try anything in this date, but it won&#039;t kill you to believe that something good is gonna happen. This belief could mean a lot if everyone would share it. You know, every end is the beginning of something new&nbsp; ;)
