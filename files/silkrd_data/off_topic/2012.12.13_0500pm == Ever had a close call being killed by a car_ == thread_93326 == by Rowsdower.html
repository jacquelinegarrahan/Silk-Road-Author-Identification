				I&#039;ve never been actually hit as a pedestrian by a car, but one of my best friends became disabled when he got run over many years ago.&nbsp; A couple days ago I was like an inch away from being hit by a car going at least 60 miles an hour that came out of nowhere and ran a red light when I was crossing a street.&nbsp; My natural reaction was to yell some curse words and do a sprint jump as fast as I could to narrowly avoid it.&nbsp; It definitely made me appreciate life more though in some weird way, as soon as I went home I rolled a fat blunt and did some rails of ketamine to celebrate the fact I wasn&#039;t splattered all over the street and sidewalk in a gory mess.<br /><br />I also afterwards thought of how embarassing it might have been to die like that, because I had all sorts of drugs in my system so if a local news story was made about my death it probably would have made me seem like a giant junkie, and I probably would have shit my pants as well as spilling guts all over the place.&nbsp; Anyone here had close calls like this where you avoided death by an inch or two, and did you party afterwards?

				I&#039;ve never been INCHES away, but I did&#039;t have a close call one day. When I was in high school I drove myself and 2 or 3 others to Mcdonalds or something. On the way back, we get to a really big intersection, and I get in the turn lane to take a left back on to the road that our school was on. The light was red at first, and when the arrow turned green, I happened to be looking down to change the CD that was in the stereo I think. I looked up like a half a second after it turned green, and a big ass mack truck comes barreling through the intersection after he ran the red light. I probably still wouldn&#039;t have gotten hit if my head was up because the dude ran the red light so soon after it changed color, but it would have been REALLY close. It was enough to scare me and everyone else in the car. I don&#039;t remember what we did&#039; after, it was like 9 years ago(damn I&#039;m kind of starting to get old.)

				Yeah. I was crossing the street on my bike. The car hit my front wheel, wrecking my bike. I make a very sharp turn and jumped off my bike. I was unharmed, which is basically a miracle. The light turned red as I was crossing and the guy fucking beeped as he hit me! They sped off and got away with it of course. I wheeled my bike to the nearest dumpster...

				Never a car but I survived being hit by a train. It was only a single locomotive and not a full train, though. What happened was I wasn&#039;t paying attention and the crossing was in the middle of nowhere had no lights, nothing at all. A tree line blocked most of your view so you couldn&#039;t really see anyways. Well, I stopped then took off like normal then I heard the horn, looked over, saw a huge round light and bam it hit the front right fender of my friends truck it wasn&#039;t even mine, lol. When the train hit every single window just shattered completely and the train drug the truck 130 feet down the tracks before it was able to stop. While I was being drug down the track the truck was just getting eaten by the train from the passenger side, the passenger door was against me in the driver seat when it stopped. The guy told me if the train was anything more then just a locomotive there was no way it could have stopped, crazy shit...
