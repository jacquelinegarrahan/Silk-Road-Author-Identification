				any suggestions?<br />air port i will going to will have a full body scanner, from what ive read best thing is to use a vitamin bottle and fill a cap with mdma and put in check in luggage,<br /><br />but my idea was to wrap the mdma (between .2-.4) in plastic and wrap gum around the plastic and keep in my mouth so it looks like im chewing gum that way worse case scenario i could just swallow and not have to worry about getting caught. any thoughts?

				I went to Las Vegas last weekend, brought several molly capsules onboard in my my checked bags. Had them in a small container of tylenols (the oblong kind that are capsule shaped), had no problems doing so.<br /><br />I&#039;d avoid the gum in your mouth thing, if I were you.&nbsp; Just my two cents, they may wonder why you&#039;re not chewing on it.

				Body packing is a classic method.<br /><br />-Cut off the fingers of some latex gloves. (You can&#039;t have latex allergies for this)<br /><br />-Use a plastic bag to store the mdma. (Might work better if substance is not in capsules.)<br /><br />-Double or triple wrap the plastic bag with the latex fingers. (Tie the ends tightly!)<br /><br />-Swallow the package. (The latex will not digest in your stomach. And make sure a trusted friend is near just in case of any choking situation)<br /><br />-Board the plane. (Try to appear as normal as possible to avoid being selected for the scanner, &quot;I think&quot; you also have the right to choose a pat down instead of the scanner if you are pulled to the side. I&#039;d just let them grope you down as they won&#039;t be able to feel the package in your gut.)<br /><br />-When you arrive at your destination simply wait for nature to run its course and crap that sucker out. (Do not try to induce vomiting as this is dangerous.) <br /><br />Also note that its not unheard of for the package to become stuck inside of you. Although rare this is really bad for you. I&#039;d make sure that its just a small amount to reduce the possibility of anything going wrong. Seek medical help if you don&#039;t see it in a week or so. I have personally attempted this method once and a little over 24 hours later the motherfucking eagle landed and Walt Disney World truly became a magical place!

				Don&#039;t have it on your person, the full body scanner will see something taped to your leg. Put it in your carry on they won&#039;t notice or care.

				For me, I mail what I want to myself at the hotel Im staying at either the day before or the day I leave (usually just 7g or so of weed and one time a 10 strip of blotter to myself but I was going to Las Vegas).. within in one or two days I have what I wanted and absolutely no worries of getting caught.. This is probably the safest way to do it..
