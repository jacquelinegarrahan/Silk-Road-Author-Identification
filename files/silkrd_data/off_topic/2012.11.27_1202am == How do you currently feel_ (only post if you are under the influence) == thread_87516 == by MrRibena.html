				Currently drunk off rum. I just asked myself whether I prefer the feeling of being drunk or high (from weed) and I honestly prefer weed. I feel great right now but I know in about 2-3 hours time I&#039;ll feel shit, and in the morning I&#039;ll feel shit but for now I feel good. Lots of music, lots of conversation with friends and randoms on twitter but I cant game online which I can when high. I dont like drinking that much but im out of weed so this will have to suffice. It&#039;s a nice feeling but I know the come down is bad, and unsustainable and certainly not productive long term. When I have weed I dont get drunk at all. I probably wouldnt post such a stupid thread when high either. I&#039;ve always been interested in what action you take when under the influence.<br /><br />If you currently are, tell us how you feel and whats going on with you.

If I want to stumble and giggle I take ketamine, a lot less entering your body for the desired effect. Alcohol is just empty calories, horrible body load. Smoking my hempstar diamond kush salad on a cold monday night.<br /><br />Edit: Also I think technically speaking on a drug forum cannabis and alcohol don&#039;t really count. In such a sense I suppose I&#039;m &quot;high&quot; on dexedrine aswell

				whaaat? Alcohol just makes me eat like a fatass and fall asleep. Weed too. I&#039;m not knocking them, but they have no appeal for me. I&#039;m low energy by nature, I need uppers. ;)<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m currently chatty and giddy and really, really horny off MDPV. ^___^ And that&#039;s exactly how I like my drugs to make me feel! I used to dig coke, but I discovered pv has twice the high, less of a shitty comedown, and cost a fraction of coke.<br /><br />Anyway, I fucking love it. Just sucks doing it alone. ;(<br /><br /><br />I could write fucking novels when on MDPV so I&#039;ll stop babbling while I&#039;m ahead...
