				Thats shitty. When I first started I wrote everything down on a piece of paper. I used that for maybe a week or so until I could remember everything and had my first couple of transactions under my belt.&nbsp; Then I burned the paper. <br /><br />Sucks that you have to wait now! Might as well use this time to read up on the forums and work on finding reliable vendors, ask questions, etc. Good luck!

				I did that when I first started too. Contact SR Support on your other account and see if they can do anything for you. Tell them the BTC&#039;s you have in your account for proof. Good Luck my man!

It might be a blessing in disguise though. A lot of people rush into buying without doing enough research and end up getting scammed or fucking up somehow.

				Yes, for accounts created since the PIN came into existence you create the PIN when you create your account.&nbsp; <br /><br />Forgotten PIN&#039;s seem to be an almost daily occurrence on SR.&nbsp; Either they forgot to set it when they created the account (or forgot what they set it to) or they set it so long ago they have forgotten what it is.<br /><br />If you have forgotten your PIN try not to lock yourself out of the PIN entry routine.&nbsp; Stop before the maximum tries.<br /><br />Then send a POLITE pm to SR support.&nbsp; Keep it short and simple:<br /><br />&quot;Hello, Sorry to be bothering you but I was trying to create an order only to realize that it&#039;s been so long since I setup my PIN that I have completely forgotten it.&nbsp; Would it be possible to have my PIN reset so that I may make a new one?<br /><br />Thanks&quot;<br /><br />If you keep it simple and ask politely hopefully you will have your PIN reset in a few hours.<br /><br />It worked for me.&nbsp; I was on SR before they had PIN&#039;s and they installed a routine that would kick in when you logged on asking you to create a PIN.&nbsp; I set the PIN without really paying much attention to it and when it came time for me to place a new order I couldn&#039;t for the life of me remember what the PIN number was.&nbsp; I sent a short, polite, PM and they reset it for me that day.

				Hello everybody. I am waiting in anticipation to make my first buy also. Never even heard of bit coin until I found Silk Road. I surfed the website for two days before I got excited enough to want to buy. I was like a puppy playing with a new chew toy. Then I ran into this bit coin ordeal and realized I would have to wait. I was just so taken by Silk Road that it was 2 days later before I even raised my head. I am totally hooked!<br /><br />I researched the bit coin thing learning about the constant fluctuating market price of the bit coin. I think it&#039;s an awesome currency. Looks like the wave of the future. Has anybody got anything good to say about GetBitCoin.com? I decided to try them since the cost was at market value and their fee is 5% of the total bit coin. I mowed a couple of yards and sent them a money order for forty bucks to do a test buy. They have kept up communications really good so far and they are working 7 days a week. They don&#039;t have a bank in my town but I am moving to a new address and will be there next week. They haven&#039;t got my money order yet but they are on the opposite side of the country then me. The town where I am moving has a bank they use tho. <br /><br />I am taking extra pre cautions when I get moved. I am putting in a new ethernet card and changing the mac address on my router. I am canceling email accounts and starting out new again. I see no reason to cancel out my Silk Road account tho. I am really loving this site. I like it much better than Black Market Reloaded. I found them both at the same time you know. I am wandering if GetBitCoin.com can send the bit coin directly to my bit coin address here on Silk Road. I am also wandering if I can transfer bit coin to any other bit coin address on other websites. If anybody has the answers to these inquiries then please don&#039;t hesitate to let me know right here. Thank you and thank God we got a way to buy the pleasure we all enjoy from setting on our asses. It&#039;s much better then exposing it to kids. It&#039;s better then risking our lives and freedom trying to buy from street dealers. If this kind of business was kept to sites like this then it would greatly decrease the violence and crime.<br /><br />Now there&#039;s a way to get things that are not available in my area. Hell yea!!!

				Here&#039;s the way it goes regarding PIN resets, at least as far as I understand it, and what my experience tells me...<br /><br />If you lock yourself out by using up all your attempts, you&#039;ll receive a PIN reset message from SR.&nbsp; You&#039;re supposed to wait seven days to respond to it, then SR will reset your PIN.&nbsp; Supposed to be another step to protect against people trying to gain unauthorized access to your coins.&nbsp; That way, if your password is compromised, you still have the protection of your secondary PIN to prevent the same person from draining your account.<br /><br />However, if you already know that you&#039;ve forgotten your PIN, don&#039;t use up all your attempts trying to remember it.&nbsp; Message SR preemptively, and let them know what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; Assuming everything seems legit on their end, they&#039;ll send you the PIN reset message, and will let you reset it without waiting seven days.&nbsp; Once you&#039;ve reset your PIN, it may take roughly 24 hours for you to be able to use it.&nbsp; This has been my experience the one time I forgot it.&nbsp; I was off only by capitalization or punctuation, and I suspect that this was probably evident to whoever fielded my request for help.<br /><br />Keep in mind that if something DOES NOT seem legit, no amount of pleading or badgering is going to convince them to let you reset it immediately, and you&#039;ll have to wait the obligatory seven days.<br /><br />Remember that there is a human being receiving your desperate private messages for help.&nbsp; That human being is going to have to make a judgment call based on the information available to them.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t seem to be a set-in-stone, cut and dried process, which is why some people are able to get it resolved immediately, and why others can&#039;t even get it resolved in seven days.
