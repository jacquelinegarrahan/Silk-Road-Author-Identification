				So i was thinking about when the road went down for a week and i ended up going dry because i deposited money to order weed like an hour before it went down. i would like to see some of our respectable and established vendors make accounts to vend also from BMR. dont get me wrong SR is the best and nothing it going to top it. but in the event that the road went down for any extended period of time we would have a back-up option for getting our supplies and vendors would have to lose money from not being able to do business, last time we went down i totally would have made orders from there if only i had seen some of my favorite names that i order from regularly. i would always without a doubt come to the road first out of loyalty and respect if nothing else but it would be really nice to have a contingency plan ya know.

				I am in process gauging interest for a Vendor account but am worried with it always being down and sketchy actively lately.. I just don&#039;t think there are buyers there and do they still offer escrow and a way to see the buyers stats?

				yeah its very similar to the road. and i imagine that as people find out about bmr they will be much more active when the road is down at least. this&nbsp; will always be my first choice

				I created a vendor account on BMR as well.<br />But the activity on this site is only a small percentage of the vast amount of visitors on SR.<br />Not bad to have a backup plan though.<br />I think BMR is very similar to SR, not as good, but good enough to keep in mind.<br /><br />CandM

				Since SR went down I&#039;ve started buying regularly from BMR.I found some really good vendors on there who we&#039;re absent on SR, so while I still use SR for most my buying, it&#039;s no longer my only source.
