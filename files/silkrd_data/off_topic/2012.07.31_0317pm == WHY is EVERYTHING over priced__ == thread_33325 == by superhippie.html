				Why would you come on here to buy weed if you live in cali...lol the prices are so much better there.<br /><br />Anyway, it&#039;s because of the time, effort, and difficulty put in to shipping your product of choice. The ones that go through customs must be packaged PERFECTLY or it will most likely get seized, putting both the buyer and seller at risk. Even domestic ones have to make it through the mail centers without being found out.<br /><br />Safety is a very expensive commodity ::)

				It costs $150 to be allowed to list on SR <br />Silkroad takes&nbsp; 6% commision&nbsp; on every single listing <br />Ecrow system and resolution centre&nbsp; being scammed is another reason for high prices <br />International shipping often gets seized and sellers are forced to refund or re-ship to keep good ratings <br />People with brand new accounts claiming they didnt recieve orders and claiming up to 50% back <br />People asking for unregistered shipping and then claiming the postman stole it <br />Customs need to be bribed to turn a blind eye&nbsp; in some countries to let outgoing parcels through security checks <br />Buying packaging materials and paying someone to drive around posting stuff at various locations to avoid&nbsp; recognition <br />Paying extra to have BTC laundered and exchanged for spendable cash anonymously (without using conventional&nbsp; exchanges or banks where money laundering charges or frozen accounts may occur&nbsp; )<br /><br />there are many reasons why&nbsp; its&nbsp; more expensive than buying some drugs from your neighbourhood dealer ,these are just the ones i could think of off the top of my head <br /><br /><br />

This isn&#039;t your local market in Cali. It&#039;s global.<br /><br />2. If people are paying the very prices you consider &quot;over priced&quot;, then apparently everyone doesn&#039;t share your sentiment on the issue. <br /><br />3. This isn&#039;t your d-boy on the corner gig where a few sandwich bags from the store and a good pusher is all you need to work. People have to pay for shipping supplies, and cover a multitude of other costs (to include one&#039;s own time). <br /><br />If the prices here are so high, then go to that other site with the good reputation that you can buy illegal drugs from.... Oh wait, one doesn&#039;t exist. <br /><br />Silk Road is a monopoly when you think about it. But a much needed one. At least people are growing the balls to defy what society tries to brainwash us with.

				You say you are using weed as an example when you say EVERYTHING is overpriced. Using a product that can be acquired legally and locally in your area as an example is a terrible comparison. It&#039;s like comparing the price of an imported Durian compared to an apple you can get in your backyard.<br /><br />Internationally, the prices on SR are very decent, except for LSD (which loses additional value due to shipping overseas). I would buy weed on SR if it weren&#039;t for the inherent dangers of shipping something smelly. If all the prices on SR are &#039;way too high&#039; for you, then please stick with your locally procured ganja. You&#039;ll be supporting local businesses as well as the American economy.

				Okay sure you can get quality weed because you live in Cali but does everyone live in Cali?<br /><br />I bet you can&#039;t find quality coke, DMT, 2c, LSD, MDMA, ketamine, etc. On top of that you don&#039;t have to drive to some shady place, talk to shady people, and most importantly risk getting caught by LE.

Like I had talked about before with cannabis. If I&#039;m selling mids in my country where some places weed is hard to get, I wouldn&#039;t have a problem selling 8 gram sacks for $20 just like on the streets. I believe the possibility of the clientele i could have would potentially even out the cons that come along with shipping. I mean how many people in the Eastern US can pay 120 for a quarter pound? From what I hear not allot.<br /><br />But yeah MDMA and LSD are the shit in the NLD! You guy&#039;s don&#039;t fuck around. A buddy of mine took a quarter of one of the pink stars I bought and said he was rollin for a few hours.&nbsp; ;D

				About the LSD dry spell though, there defiantly should be more lad production in the US. And I lack the chemistry degrees to back my knowledge up but if I had the funds or could find my way in as an assistant in a lab I would utilize all my time and knowledge to producing a legit product. I love organic and bio chem even though I&#039;ve been studying didactically. I&#039;m probably the only one who has no science career (yet), but still keeps up a lab notebook . ;D

				You also have to remember that you&#039;re paying for convenience. No meeting a dealer you don&#039;t know to get a product that&#039;s new to you. No back alley deals. No strangers seeing who you are. With SR you just set up your account, and if you wanted you could try a new drug every week (not recommended... just saying) all without having to meet anyone or put yourself in any precarious positions.

Supply and demand control the entire market. If someone is overpriced, I just ignore them. no matter how badly I want whatever it is, I will not go for the ripoff. I&#039;ll wait. Even if waiting sucks.<br /><br />Also, SR strikes me as a privilege. When people complain about pricing and say &quot;it&#039;s cheaper on the street&quot;, I&#039;m confused because that means you have the prime opportunity to make bank. Why complain? Get on here and take advantage of the privilege. Seems the logical thing to do. I live in an area that is one of the top twenty suppliers in my personal favorite entertainment method, but I like the security SR affords me much better than running around the streets begging to get jacked. That security may come with a price, but I accept that.<br /><br />Just my opinion and meaning absolutely no offense, but if you know of a cheaper place to obtain the entertainment, please share your bounty in the market and I&#039;d imagine you could be rewarded well for your efforts.<br />

				Not everything is that over priced.The only thing that I can get cheaper on the streets is weed (but they DO have cheap mids and schwag on SR) and heroin and crack that I&#039;m not really that interested in anyway and the quality isn&#039;t the quality of the SR products and I cant get DMT local.Not to mention the fact that half the pills I can get locally are just some bullshit pipes or amphetamines with the occasional legit MDMA tab but on SR you can find vendors who have there shit tested and everything.The weed is crazy over priced but I&#039;m not complaining haha all you have to do is pay securely and the product of your choice is delivered straight to your door.The convenience and large selection are worth the price on some things.And I think that the pharms are so expensive like adderall and shit because most people only have a limited supply unless they can write there own prescriptions which I sincerely doubt more than like 1 or 2 on SR do.The LSD is expensive because they have to buy all the equipment all the chemicals,they have to make it,they have to deliver it to the vendor,the vendor has to buy all the shipping things,and then spend there time to check your messages and rages about how slow he is,then he has to ship it out and wait for the money to get out of escrow.So $10-20 for a hit isn&#039;t that ridiculous considering all the shit that had to happen while you&#039;re sitting on your ass just waiting for it to come.And one more reason I wouldn&#039;t complain about paying a little higher price is the anonymity and security as opposed to buying from the streets where there pigs around every corner just waiting to bust your ass and then there&#039;s the tweaking crack heads that are sometimes so strung out that they cant form sentences and get random crazy ass mood swings and there&#039;s the disgusting lowlife snitches and the psychopaths that shoot up random people and the muggers and hookers and you aren&#039;t always sure whats in your H you don&#039;t know what your blow is cut with your X is probably piperazines or amphetamines or bk-mdma which I&#039;m not saying aren&#039;t good/decent/ok drugs for some people it just makes me want to bust peoples skulls open when I pay for MDMA and get bullshit pills without them warning me first that they&#039;re adulterated.I&#039;m thankful that I found SR and I&#039;m not worried about the prices at all.

				People who are mad about SR prices should realize two important deductions from their madness:<br /><br />A: Drug X is more expensive on SR than in their country Y.<br />B: That people are visibly paying Z for drug X because they have to.<br /><br />implies<br /><br />C: You should become an international drug smuggler.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I cannot understand then, why you are mad. You should be pleased to find a lucrative opportunity in an economic down cycle.<br /><br />Yeah, thank me later or whatever.<br />&nbsp;
