				<br /><br />We are a special community no?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />I found&nbsp; this place through one of the vendors, and after thinking&nbsp; of it as a mass&nbsp; global &#039;ebay 4 drugs&#039; i was wrong there is much much more to the Silk Road new community.<br /><br />Yes drugs are being sold, and they are not cheap. In fact nearly every prohibited narcotic that has&nbsp; been made infamous in a certain part of the world is now available for mail order. This opens up a whole range of potentially amazing once in a lifetime or dangerously life threatening experiences by a few clicks of the mouse and some nervous anticipation when waiting for the postman&nbsp; &nbsp;every morning.<br />Within SR friendships and relationships even animosities are&nbsp; developing through drug sales and forum reviews are based&nbsp; around a central theme&nbsp; of &#039;trust&#039;. The strong desire to make SR work is shown by its users. There are a bunch&nbsp; of established vendors who now&nbsp; have built up a rapport through trading with&nbsp; a finite number of real honest&nbsp; &nbsp;customers in amongst&nbsp; an infinite&nbsp; number of scammers, cheats&nbsp; ,liars, thieves and (heaven forbid) Law Enforcement Officials. <br /><br />Oh yes I am guessing nearly all of us have been caught&nbsp; out at some point, and&nbsp; I bet I&nbsp; am not the only member worried and constantly looking over my shoulder half expecting a visit from whoever has intercepted the (surprisingly&nbsp; small) number of orders that&nbsp; were&nbsp; &#039;lost at sea&#039;.<br /><br />Silk Road&nbsp; has changed my&nbsp; life, rather&nbsp; than being constantly demonized&nbsp; by my nearest and dearest&nbsp; &nbsp;for being a&nbsp; ‘junkie’(even though I am a middle aged professional father) I was/am still my parents little secret ‘druggie’ son, and the secrecy about enjoying getting high&nbsp; is much less an issue now I have a great outlet in the forums and&nbsp; personal&nbsp; friendships from SR that I am not bottling anything in.&nbsp; That is not to say I am&nbsp; a&nbsp; social&nbsp; failure, however I live in a society that frowns upon&nbsp; and takes&nbsp; legal action against anyone&nbsp; openly supporting the use of ‘drugs’&nbsp; And I love most&nbsp; drugs moderately . <br /><br />Well I am happy to say&nbsp; here that I am a poly drug user with stimulants ranging from&nbsp; &nbsp;ice to caffeine in the morning slowly unwinding through the day with a mixture of CNS&nbsp; downers, opiates&nbsp; marijuana and sleeping pills. Of course weekends are for raving rolling and tweaking. Man I love SR.<br /><br />&nbsp;These days I am&nbsp; getting great advice on issues I knew very little. So Silk Road is much more than a place I buy drugs. It is now a global gathering place where goods are offered and&nbsp; there is huge discussion&nbsp; on a wide range of issues that lots of people round the World have in common. It also goes some way to show that drug users are not all junkie washouts and not&nbsp; all sellers&nbsp; are mafia type criminals.&nbsp; Although I am sure there are&nbsp; &nbsp;some big&nbsp; &nbsp;boys making use of the net to reach out and extend their customer base.<br />I hope Silk Road will be viewed as a major stepping stone in the global liberalization of drugs and drug advisory services. Without a doubt some of the best shit I have only ever dreamt about has fallen through my letterbox and I feel a more enriched confident&nbsp; character because of it. <br /><br />Tell&nbsp; us what you love&nbsp; about Silk&nbsp; Road, maybe we can&nbsp; get some form of spiritual heartbeat&nbsp; going?<br />

				Gosh a spiritual heartbeat sure would be grand, but the sad truth is that we are just a &quot;community&quot; of individuals. While Silk Road&#039;s anonymity is fantastic, all it allows us to do is exchange the money for the drugs and move on. That&#039;s about as much trust we can give; anymore and that new buddy who&#039;s coming over to get a buzz could be a LEO or you finalize early because you&#039;ve done business before and you could get scammed. If anyone is here to make friends, they&#039;re in the wrong place and sometimes its difficult to remember that (especially for loners like me).<br /><br />What Silk Road represents is a group of individuals who stride towards a common purpose and embody several of the same ideals. The idea of SR being a community is really an illusion, while in reality we&#039;re just a bunch of strangers with nothing more than an at times silly alias to distinguish amongst one another.<br /><br />Hopefully if we take the appropriate measures to legalize substances then we will be able to finally throw off the cloaks we&#039;re all wearing (oh how melodramatic).

				We are a community I would say. We are all striving for the betterment of drug control, drug safety, and the free market. <br />Every user(as a whole) is welcomed and treated with respect. I personally love silk road for the fact that it demonstrates what would happen to drugs if introduced into a mass free market. Quality will increase, prices will decrease, irresponsible using will diminish, and overall productivity will increase.

				great posts everybody. v01d, you stole the words right outta my mouth.<br /><br />i do feel as if we are a community here, we are all participating in free-trading of consumer goods. we all understand that free will is the most valuable trait of humans and we capitalize on it through this website. no tie downs of banks intercepting our transactions. this website is here for good and i am glad to be apart of this revolution.<br /><br />Let me put in my two cents - <br /><br />with this anonymous market place, the only thing that gets you sales is the reputation you earn with your customers. and there is no fear of anybody else stealing your business, unless you over price your products or send out low quality product. <br /><br /><br />

				Seems like a community to me. I am new here to SR and I have already received more help and information in an extremely expedient manner. Much better than I thought for a website of the type. Hopefully I will eventually be able to aid the community, instead of just asking questions all the time c:

				To all those who believe that profit is their only concern and this is&nbsp; just a widening&nbsp; of customer base. Please remember you are making history like it or not&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Some forum sagas are fascinating, almost bordering on insane real Hollywood&nbsp; drama&nbsp; .<br /><br />However the forum and member to member contact also creates an information superhighway with all about SR and more. And of course a handful of extremely successful sellers&nbsp; &nbsp;have built up regular client/customer relationships that are as extensive and personal as they are anonymous.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are a community I think&nbsp; we are an economic commercial political organization leading&nbsp; a fight against the global prohibition of drugs.<br /><br />But fuck the revolution I&#039;m too stoned ;D
