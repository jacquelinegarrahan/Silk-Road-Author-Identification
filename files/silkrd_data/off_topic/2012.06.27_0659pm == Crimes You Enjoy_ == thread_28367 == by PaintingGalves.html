				What other criminal things are people interested in? I&#039;m fairly fascinated by lots of crime as I assume most people are given the book section in most airports. Two things that have always fascinated me are art theft and gun running from the perspective of how would one network with clients/vendors in real life.<br /><br />Say a snatch and grab is carried out on an art piece from a museum- how do the culprits find a seller? Clients would be the super rich prepared to squirrel away the pieces for decades. You would think most art crime is contracted in advance by the purchaser but then you have cases in the last few years such as France and Sweden, where people are stashing it for safe keeping once they&#039;d stolen it. Is that a prime motivator for art theft? Just sitting on it for generations?<br /><br />Second thing I&#039;ve been obsessing over this week - if money wasn&#039;t an option - imagine you are a filthy rich aristocrat or something - how would you purchase a sweet firearms collection? Obviously buying domestic US product and secretly exporting it in cargo consignment to your home country (and incredible mansion and acreage) is the easiest but what if you wanted more than US domestic semi-autos? What would you do and where would you go for that indulgent and ridiculous shit like RPGs and belt fed machine guns? Philippines have an interesting cottage industry but you are rich and nothing but brand name and brand new weapons will fill your fat rich gun loving appetite. So what then? Third world countries? Statistics on small arms export all list the restrictive modern countries as the top sellers - because it mostly factors in state to state sales. Where does one find there very own helpful Victor Bout?<br /><br />In a purely academic sense... what other dirt are you interested in?

				If I had enough money to purchase a small arsenal, maybe if I was a coke kingpin in Columbia or something but otherwise I wouldn&#039;t risk my wonderful rich fantasy land freedom so easily.<br /><br />To the original question, I would say hacking and carding is quite interesting, from the hacker looking for exploitable wifis to the various ways others use to clean the cards out, and then the US card companies themselves who lose millions, maybe billions, yet still make so much goddamn money that it&#039;s cheaper for them to take the hit than to force US merchants to upgrade their hardware and move onto the much more secure smart cards used in Europe and elsewhere instead of the easily exploitable mag strips we still use.

				TAKING LOTS OF DRUGS AND GOING TO ILLEGAL PARTIES.<br />In all serious, i guess i like breaking the speed limit in the car, but who doesnt? Other than that i don&#039;t really commit any other crimes. Obviously i stole a few things from shops, like chocolate, food etc.. when i was younger, but that was kinda standard. If i could then i would steal a shit load of money from the government so they stop spending it on all on pointless shit.&nbsp;

I don&#039;t know much about smart chip cards in the EU as I&#039;ve been out of that game for years, but the main difference used to be that it was far easier to make counterfeit magstripe cards and cash them out with various purchases &lt;$1000. Since smart cards can&#039;t be counterfeit, is it now possible to break the microchips encryption?

Over here most wireless POS (point of sale) terminals use Bluetooth, which is still hackable but means you normally have to be sat in the restaurant or upstairs with your laptop on due to Bluetooth&#039;s short range. I think the future of Wireless POS hacking is going to be in NFC (near field communication) which is taking off big time over here in Europe, and is basically unsecured. It&#039;s used in thousands of stores here in the UK already.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28367.msg311794#msg311794">Quote from: Meister on June 27, 2012, 08:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Since smart cards can&#039;t be counterfeit, is it now possible to break the microchips encryption?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They can be counterfeit and yes it is possible to break the encryption. The difficult part is that in order to copy the chip you need to put it in some ugly looking machine without being noticed, although it&#039;s not that hard. These machines have other uses in Europe which makes them legal to buy&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Also there&#039;s no pre-made software to replicate the cards for you, so you have to know what you&#039;re doing in a Linux operating system. It takes seconds to copy the card which is the good news, especially if you&#039;re copying it in a restaurant or shop etc but pasting it to a new card and extracting the Pin is slower, although you can do that when you&#039;re home. I can paste the data to a new chip &amp; pin (smart) card in about 3 mins now, which is still quite slow compared to the various automated ways to copy the old fashioned magnetic strip cards.<br /><br />Other fun things which I enjoy doing are messing around with Oyster cards (people who live in the UK, especially London will know what they are). Essentially they are wireless payment cards which you use to tap in and out of trains and buses in London, UK. You can copy the data off one on certain Android mobile phones containing an NFC chip (Samsung Galaxy Nexus etc), and then when it runs out, paste the data back on again and again giving yourself infinite credit. All you need is the Oyster card and your phone. Other countries use the same technology and I assume it would work the same.

				To get the barcode I just bought some cheapish honey, same brand/same jar/weight for Â£3, (Rowe organic). I had to soak the label in acetone to remove it.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Then I cut it out stuck it on the back of my loyalty card (the adhesive remains intact). Now I just go to the shop and pick up a Â£15 jar of Rowe Manuka 15+ honey for Â£3 every time I run out (i love honey). I usually do it whilst buying a few other small&nbsp; items and always pay cash, just common sense. I only wish they sold the 20+ stuff&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />As far as I know, Individual products all use the same barcode (so coca cola 500ml bottles will all share the same code, all 2litre bottles will have another, and so on), I always check the barcode hasn&#039;t changed before I go to the checkout. It should work in any store, you can always confirm the code is the same.<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve coded about Â£75 quids worth... master criminal!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Might start selling it on SR&nbsp; :P

Gold may be going down in value but it will ultimately always be a secure asset to have. The prices of gold fluctuate because of the engineering that comes of it being traded on the commodities market however those values are not real, they are just human perception (like all value is). When it comes to the crunch gold will always be secure.

I usually do it whilst buying a few other small&nbsp; items and always pay cash, just common sense stuff.<br /><br />As far as I know, Individual products all use the same barcode (so coca cola 500ml bottles will all share the same code, all 2litre bottles will have another, and so on), I always check the barcode hasn&#039;t changed before I go to the checkout. It should work in any store, you can always confirm the code is the same.<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve coded about Â£75 quids worth&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Might start selling it on SR&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s a bit over the top.<br /><br />You do know that a bar code is just a list of numbers, they can be any size, shape etc as long as the machine can read them.<br /><br />Just scan the barcode of product X (cheap honey of same weight) with your phone, then when you go to checkout show scan or photo to machine and profit!! The machine will read the barcode from anything, as long as it&#039;s the right numbers.<br /><br />You can work out the numbers for discount X say -Â£50 from bill if you want. Although don&#039;t go too over the top as some discount require supervisor approval. You can make the barcodes from numbers on tonnes of websites, such as:<br /><br />http://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/index.php<br /><br />Enjoy&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its not that bad, It only takes about 15 mins to prepare. Good repeated discount for a small&nbsp; onetime effort. Saved myself Â£60 on those 10 minutes.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I don&#039;t go through that process every time, once is all you need! I just use the same barcode over and over.<br />Plus I like the stealth of having it on my loyalty card because you are supposed to scan the barcode on that to get reward points, so it looks all legit to the cashier manning the auto checkout (not that they pay much attention anyway) and the CCTV.<br /><br />Hadn&#039;t thought about using discount codes or scanning with phone, very clever.&nbsp; 8)

Gold may be going down in value but it will ultimately always be a secure asset to have. The prices of gold fluctuate because of the engineering that comes of it being traded on the commodities market however those values are not real, they are just human perception (like all value is). When it comes to the crunch gold will always be secure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not talking about the price/value of gold (spot fix) I&#039;m talking specifically about shares in the major companies that mine gold. And believe me, they&#039;re dropping like hot potatoes, and there&#039;s the usual incremental increase in the values of silver and platinum. <br /><br />It&#039;s to do with long term global recovery (inevitable) and China&#039;s recent resource agreement&#039;s with Latin American countries.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m not going to give anymore investment advice here, but I&#039;ve over doubled my money since April which isn&#039;t bad for a perfectly legal hobby.

Silver might be a good investment. I reckon supply will be limited in the future, and I have some coins put away. The tech boom in the 90&#039;s drove up the price of silver 10x easily.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Silver is an OK-ish investment. The only issue with it is (if you ask any metallurgy expert or jeweler) that it is worth less than tin or copper in real terms. It&#039;s effectively useless other than it&#039;s cheap shiny properties, which only hold value ironically as long as it is cheap.<br /><br />Platinum is a better investment. You short platinum and buy gold when gold is on the rise, and you buy platinum and short gold when gold is on the drop. It&#039;s always been like this for the past 300 or so years since stock markets existed, it&#039;s not exactly rocket science.<br /><br />Platinum has a huge amount of uses, particularly in industrial chemistry as a catalyst, for example it&#039;s used to make every single bit of fertilizer that&#039;s sprayed onto your crops in those farmers fields, and realistically this makes it more valuable than aesthetically pleasing &quot;pretty&quot; gold. This is why platinum always rises when gold falls.

				currently my only real crime is importing drugs for personal consumption.<br /><br />but i really love trespassing, its a fun and victimless crime.&nbsp; I like exploring my town at 3am, going into all the places i&#039;m &quot;not allowed.&quot;&nbsp; sometimes i set up harmless pranks, but most of the time i just observe.&nbsp; this sounds ridiculous, but i&#039;m a grown man and I still go out pumpkin smashing if I remember to on a good night.&nbsp; I wait for the first mild evening after thanksgiving (usa) and I go out at 2am and raid people&#039;s porches for their pumpkins.&nbsp; i get a rush from sneaking onto their property and bashing up that big piece of fruit and then high-tailing it.&nbsp; lulz, i&#039;m a weirdo, what can i say?&nbsp; i figure if they still have a pumpkin out in late november then its just gonna rot anyway....might as well have some fun with it.<br /><br />i used to be all about shoplifting, but now that i have money to buy all the things i need I don&#039;t do it anymore.&nbsp; back in my broke-ass hippie days i would always come out of a grocery store trip with at least $20 worth of free stuff by various means.&nbsp; i was a red bull addict and refused to pay for it because i figured they wouldn&#039;t make the can fit so perfectly in a pocket if they didn&#039;t want it to be stolen ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m real good with slight-of-hand stuff and would usually steal stuff right up at the counter.&nbsp; when i was a kid, i was the master of stealing cigarettes from convenience stores....reach around the cabinet when they look at the register or in any way take their gaze off you.&nbsp; my friends were never less than amazed and grateful for my skills.<br /><br />vandalism is fun when you&#039;re fucking shit faced, but unless its public property you&#039;ll probably feel bad about it the next day.&nbsp; vandalism of public property can be a lot of fun though....walk around town with a pint of whiskey and a can of spraypaint and you will have some good times.&nbsp; <br /><br />wish i was into crimes that paid money...i tried selling weed in college and sucked at it, then tried again selling ketamine but couldn&#039;t make a big enough investment to make it worth anything other than free K.&nbsp; i&#039;m not the kind of dude who&#039;d be good at drug dealing anyway, i&#039;m too nice.&nbsp;
