				In my barred up state, I just now realized that I have no friends in real life or online.&nbsp; :( My husband went to the store and I wanted to bull shit with someone because I&#039;m bored and I can&#039;t think of one person I could talk to. I&#039;m not the nicest person. In fact, I&#039;ve been told on numerous occasions that I am a difficult person to talk to or even like. I need some low maintenance friends. Any takers?

				I can relate to that - a need for social contact but a definite disinterest in heavily investing in all the obligation and expectation, spoken and otherwise, that comes with it.<br /><br />Sounds like me a few years back. Feel free to shoot the shit - can&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll get a reply, but I guarantee that unless it involves drugs or money, there won&#039;t be a deal of heavily invested expectations here. :-)<br /><br />So - why didn&#039;t you go to the store with your hubby then?

				Thanks Shapes! You helped me out and I have moments where there is a glimmer of good in me but I usually only care about my family, including husband and kids. Not even my mom which is kind of bad but she is too high maintenance for me to tolerate.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t go to the store because I don&#039;t leave the house. I have a seizure disorder so I figure it is safer for me to stay home rather than having to worry about being at the store, having a seizure, shitting myself in public and causing a huge scene. The very sad truth.

				Feel for that one. It was, for a number of years, impossible for me to leave the house due to the consequences of various ailments kicking in.<br /><br />And astor - same here.

				I &lt;3 this community! You guys all seem awesome. My husband and I moved to the middle of no where to take care of my mom who is going through a nasty divorce and losing her mind. So, I have him to talk to but frequently I need an outsider&#039;s opinion on things. I don&#039;t mind not having any interaction with people face to face but when I get in my super obnoxious moods (drunk), I always want to talk. I may hit some of you guys up next time that happens!

				OMG, first of all, you should join IRC... i will be back with the link since i have to go on a hunt for it since the stickies are gone...<br /><br />**ETA Thread link: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=175.555<br /><br />i will be your best low-maintenance sr friend :) i have too many friends irl... i am in the process of weeding out them out, actually :) i dont know what&#039;s worse...&nbsp; not having any friends or having too many high maintenance friends. one of my girlfriends got pissed at me bc she was having some sort of crisis and called me. when i didn&#039;t pick up the phone she left a voicemail. i did not call her back right away bc i did not check the voicemail right away... but who DAFUK leaves a voicemail these days? SEND ME A TEXT MESSAGE YOU FUCKING LUNATIC<br /><br />Anyway, i hope it isn&#039;t rude to barge into a &quot;i need friends&quot;&nbsp; thread and talk about how many i have, but srrssslllyyyyy, real people are BORING. you are probably better off without them. SILK ROAD friends are the best kind i have ever had. everytime i get to know somebody here i fall in love (not kidding)... i think it&#039;s bc i dont meet these kind of people irl. ever. it&#039;s a goddamn shame. i&#039;ve said it this before to kitkat (kitkatisborednow), and i&#039;ll say it again to you, baby:<br /><br />FUCK IRL FRIENDS, WE HAVE EACHOTHER &lt;3 <br /><br />maybe it&#039;s good advice, maybe not. ask your intolerable mom. i asked mine :) her response was &quot;you are always interfaced with some piece of technology. go outside.&quot;

I&#039;ve heard about IRC, I&#039;d like to give it a shot!<br /><br />You weren&#039;t being rude talking about all your friends at all! And yes, my mom is fucking intolerable.

The poll won&#039;t show any results until the vote is over! I just have my fingers crossed! I don&#039;t even do tar but I still wanna win just for competitions&#039; sake. Thanks for asking. I hope I get votes. It would do wonders for my self esteem if I won.<br /><br />If anyone wants to go vote, Nod4less is holding it.
