Cicero is also an expert on many subjects.<br /><br />Cicero does believe one can look at Google or Wikipedia for help with your homework though. Ciceros&#039; valuable time and bandwidth should not be wasted.

				Cicero has had a superb stroke of genius, and decided to introduce an ignore list.

Cicero has interests in this area.<br /><br />Firstly, Modern-day Egyptians are a mix of ARAB peoples, and SKINNY peoples, from Sudan/Ethiopia/Somalia. This race are NOT the race of people that built the pryamids.<br /><br />The Giza plataeu has been used for many thousands of years. The Sphinx is definatly several thousand years older than the Great Pyramid. The Sphinx&#039;s secrets have yet to be discovered.<br /><br />You are totally correct. The cuts made on the granite blocks in the quarry extraction and construction process could not be made today with such precision.<br /><br />You also have to realise that pryamid structures we being constructed for similar purposes, at around the same time in Latin America.<br /><br />Maybe the human race is decended from Aliens? <br /><br />Certainly our timeline is NOT correct, and advanced civilisations have gone before us. Atlantis is certain to have existed but we know little about it aside from Platos writings.<br /><br />&quot;Forbidden&quot; archaeology is a facinating area for Cicero, and its the reason why many institutions exist.<br /><br />Cicero thinks the key to the Egyptian pyramids, or at least much more knowledge lies undiscovered in Ethiopia or Sudan.<br /><br /><br />Cicero thanks you for your facinating, eye opening question.<br /><br />Cicero wishes he could give you Kalma.<br /><br />I AM CiCeRo and I answer EVERY question.<br />

Heres a serious question though <br /><br />question: was the great pyrimids built by aliens from another planet or by an advanced civilization which had lived before our time? <br /><br />one things for sure though, the Egyptians did not build&nbsp; the pyramids. Even modern technology cannot cut the 1 million rocks as accurately as did the original creators of the pyramids. And to think that Egyptians used primitive tools like rocks to scratch the stones into blocks with perfect edges is just ludicrous. It would take modern civilization more than 10 years juts to excavate the amount of rocks used in the building GIza. Also, recent research shows that the sphynx&#039;s symmetrical head is nearly impossible to recreate without using computers. <br /><br />So what do you think?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cicero thanks you for bringing him a question so beautiful that it brings a tear to Cicero&#039;s eye. Cicero truly admires your question-asking ability :)<br /><br /><br />Cicero thanks you for questioning the legitimate explanation of the Pyramids. Cicero has interests in this area.<br /><br />Firstly, Modern-day Egyptians are a mix of ARAB peoples, and SKINNY peoples, from Sudan/Ethiopia/Somalia. This race are NOT the race of people that built the pryamids.<br /><br />The Giza plataeu has been used for many thousands of years. The Sphinx is definatly several thousand years older than the Great Pyramid. The Sphinx&#039;s secrets have yet to be discovered.<br /><br />You are totally correct. The cuts made on the granite blocks in the quarry extraction and construction process could not be made today with such precision.<br /><br />You also have to realise that pryamid structures we being constructed for similar purposes, at around the same time in Latin America.<br /><br />Maybe the human race is decended from Aliens? <br /><br />Certainly our timeline is NOT correct, and advanced civilisations have gone before us. Atlantis is certain to have existed but we know little about it aside from Platos writings.<br /><br />&quot;Forbidden&quot; archaeology is a facinating area for Cicero, and its the reason why many institutions exist.<br /><br />Cicero thinks the key to the Egyptian pyramids, or at least much more knowledge lies undiscovered in Ethiopia or Sudan.<br /><br /><br />Cicero thanks you for your facinating, eye opening question.<br /><br />Cicero wishes he could give you Kalma.<br /><br />I AM CiCeRo and I answer EVERY question.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />why thank you for your insights! I once watched this documentary about how alot of the pyramids around the world are build to be &quot;earthquakeproof&quot; through the usage of irregularly shaped blocks. The fact that hundreds of these ancient pyramids across the globe are built in this same fashion is a sure sign that intelligent life must have thrived before us. <br /><br />I would like to share with everyone the documentary that I watched which explains alot of this stuff that i&#039;m talking about: <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooy2LTJoMVM<br />
