				Working for others smuggling is a fools game. Many people get offers of free holidays and Â£5000 a kilo but they end up spending two weeks terrified at the prospect of jail in some nation whose jails are survival of the fittest. <br /><br />Swallowing drugs is bad IMO. Its a fools game. I&#039;d be terrified sitting on a 9 hour plane journey imagining the first hint of a coke high. Imagine you started to get chatty and felt GREAT until you realized that 10 gram or whatever of pure cocaine was slowly filtering into the bloodsteam. That would be scary.<br /><br />Customs are good at what they do. Any method you can think of has been spotted. Trouble is there is so much volume and the most any mail gets is a sniffer dog running over plane cargo. Most drugs are smuggled in cargo. We know how easy it is to post drugs cross border.<br /><br />And going into a club in Mexico and asking a stranger for maybe a kilo of coke is asking to be robbed. You may get lucky but its high risk. You would be given pure coke to test out and have to make a snap decision in some hotel room. There is no escrow. If someone pulls a gun and robs you it would be impossible to inform the cops. The odds of being ripped off buying drugs on the street is very high.<br /><br />I knew people who smuggled from India way back. They would swallow a kilo of hash and that aint too bad as the worse happens is you get stoned. But the Indians have now gained a great knowledge of what Westerners pay for hash. They also know how to make fake hash and many the backpacker has bought weed only for the cousin cop of the dealer to tax you (if your lucky) and arrest you if he wants a gold star.<br /><br />Any smuggler is basically saying a prayer as he passes over borders.<br /><br />The best way of smuggling is to sit back in the chair and order online. Let the postal service smuggle it for you! If you have enough to go to Mexico and buy something there - ask a dealer here for a custom listing. <br /><br />The temptation is big.<br /><br />But I think foreign jails are an incentive to not smuggle on your person. <br /><br />You would be better going to Mexico or wherever, buying whatever and posting it back in dozens of different packages. 70% would make it. <br /><br />Then you can walk through customs relaxed and not giving a damn!<br /><br />&nbsp;:D

				I used to have a friend who&#039;s BF would get paid to drive with another guy in a white van and pick up packages at the airport. Not sure how he got the gig but I don&#039;t think it paid very well.

				Why on earth would you want a smuggling job?<br />As other posters have said, it&#039;s dangerous and extremely risky.<br />I suppose I could justify smuggling if it were to, say, save your family from being killed, or something. Not just because you want a job that could potentially yield high rewards.<br /><br /><br />sdesu

				A recently discovered version was an old thai man and wife, gave off the usual suspicous signs not eating or drinking on the plane, even hrs after being scanned for to c if the dope was in ther stomach ,and cavitied searched,the police found nothing. so upon hearing this news the Thai couple broke into huge smiles and started talking to fast,when one of the couples teethe came shooting out of his /hers mouth. the back molars were all fine but they had chipped from the jolt and impact this chip was then tested to reveal pure raw grade 4 h,even the gums were h, It also explained the lack of interest in food .
