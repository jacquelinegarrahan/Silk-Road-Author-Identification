				Hey guys, I wanted to know, because in the guide it says to put a name and/or different way? I mean, if I use the &quot;tor&quot;, &quot;vpn&quot; satisfied with &quot;bitcon&quot; converted from &quot;ukash&quot; (anonymously paying 15% for the &quot;noise&quot;) and each transition could also change your address bitcoin, why should I risk losing my package? That is, do not sign if he comes, if he wants to put a signature X, if you get any government agency have to be my fault? That is, a person can not send a package without my being aware of it? How do they prove otherwise? I hope I was clear, I&#039;m trying to get the perspective of the buyer anonymous, cabbage is not a hustler or a gangster, I just want to try the service lol. I want to put my real data for the shipment to ... is a stupid question? Thanks in advance guys! Good going!

				Yes, it should be addressed to your real name. <br />You could put initial for your first name like &quot;J. Smith&quot;.

How often do you receive packages with normal merchandise using just an initial and last name? Never, right? Don&#039;t think the postal inspectors are stupid, please.
