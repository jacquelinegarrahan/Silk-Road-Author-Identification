				Hi All<br /><br /><br />I have a microchip number for my old dog, that I would like tracked/located.<br /><br />I gave up my dog, due to my poor health, work and other circumstances beyond my control.<br /><br />Its a decision I greatly regret. I would like to track the location of the dog, so that I can see if the new owner, by the appearance of a co-incidental &quot;running into&quot;, would be willing to sell the dog back to me.<br /><br />Please dont think that I would in any way use the given information to steal the dog or anything like that. I would never do that to anyone.<br /><br />I guess in order for you to be able to access this information, you would probably need to know/be/have access to: a vet nurse, vet, vet clinic admin, animal shelter admin, Central Animal Records database, council officer or the such.<br /><br />Im not sure what kind of fee you would like for such a service, but Im sure we can work something out. Bitcoins are my preferred payment methods, though Im open to other forms of payment.<br /><br />Contact me either by reply post or a private message and we can take it from there.<br /><br />Cheers

				Hey mate,<br /><br />I had a gf with a similar problem. Someone stole her rescued pit bull out of her yard.&nbsp; Probably used it for fight training.<br /><br />It really was hard for her.&nbsp; I never forgot that.&nbsp; I&#039;m in the US or I would help you.<br /><br />I really hope some of the guys here help you.&nbsp; Would love to hear you got your dog back.<br /><br />best of luck. :)
