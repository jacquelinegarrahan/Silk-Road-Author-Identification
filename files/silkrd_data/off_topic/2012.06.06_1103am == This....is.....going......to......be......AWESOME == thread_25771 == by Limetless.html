				I knew I wasn&#039;t the only one&nbsp; :)<br /><br />It has to be said though. There&#039;s waaaaaaaaaaaay too much of this male pussification going on in society these days. If you show your masculinity, you are somehow a dick. Doesn&#039;t make much sense to me. Plus girls are a whole lot more violent/abrasive than most guys. If I tell a guy I think he&#039;s full of shit (and I only say it when I think it), most of the time they&#039;ll just insult me back. Girls on the other hand... they&#039;ll go fucking MENTAL. Slap you, drinks in the face, get their guy friends to start on you, it&#039;s pathetic. They need to learn that having a vagina doesn&#039;t mean you own the world, and get some perspective and take some fucking criticism.<br /><br />I guess it is cause they are so used to having guys pander/do anything for them to get laid, that they forget what its like to actually have someone disagree with everything you stand for. <br /><br />And here&#039;s a real life example of the male pussification.. <br /><br />Me saying this is sexist.. but a woman saying all men are pigs is pop culture. &quot;You go girlfriend!&quot;.. <br /><br />That&#039;s it right there.

				I liked the part where Ted&#039;s hitting the bong and Mark&#039;s got a joint in his mouth gutting the box of Pops lol. And him gesturing to the cashier girl was hilarious. I think this movie will be a classic, you know Seth has thousands of funny ass skits that were too edgy for Family Guy, but will be a blast on a rated R movie coming from the mouth of a teddy bear.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had time to look for different clips but I saw a picture of Ted sitting on the couch with a bunch of women that look like hookers, that&#039;s a positive sign lol.

				The girls that seem to get along with my group of guy friends quite well have all been pretty solid sluts. Chicken or the egg thing, I don&#039;t know which came first, their affinity to being friends with more guys than girls or their vending machine like ability to spread their legs after dropping a few drinks in them.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a succession of 3 girls over the past few years that specifically fit this role in that they joined our group of guys, the inner circle not the outer circle where tag along girlfriends remain and the conversations are always curbed to not get the boyfriends in hot water. All 3 started with a &#039;yea she&#039;s cool, like one of the guys&#039; type of vibe but they all ended up sleeping with 1 or more of us and ended up being a volcano of drama in the end.

They are out there, and they&#039;re the most interesting, but intimidating, because they are always very very very confident and self aware. Which is a badass thing, but still a bit scary cause you can&#039;t hide your flaws from a girl like that.

				This sounds like Wilfred (rip off).<br /><br />&quot;Anarchic, irreverent, unshaven, drinks beer, smokes bongs, farts, roots, eats nachos, swears and speaks with an Australian accent&quot;.<br /><br />He and Frodo constantly get high and contemplate the secrets of life. American version is quite good, Australian one I just don&#039;t get.<br /><br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1703925/
