				I am going to be a dad too. I need to fill out a job app once my last orders from SR come threw and I finish them off. I can&#039;t have drugs coming in the mail while I start a new job or I will not be able to keep it. <br />

				I&#039;m kinda excited now. Turns out I just needed some motivation to get out of this sink hole i&#039;ve been in. &quot;We&#039;re having a baby!&quot; seems to be that motivator. :) Thanks guys. &lt;3 (No homo on the heart, it&#039;s just nice seeing people be so supportive. :) .. I also might be at the end of a roll. Maybe.)

				I had children once, too many to bloody count. I was overwhelmed so I gave it some long and careful thought, and decided it had to be medical experiments for the lot of them. Been happier and wealthier ever since. :)
