				Tomorrow I am officially in my late twenties. I&#039;ve done every thing right for the past two years. I go to the gym 4 times a week, I eat right, I went back to school, I got a job, I went to a psychiatrist, I take my pills every morning, I&#039;m doing everything I&#039;m supposed to be doing. But life still sucks. I&#039;ve managed to do accomplish all the goals on my end, but have gotten nothing for it. I still live at home, women want nothing to do with me, my friends never have any time for me, I get up every day and I don&#039;t know how I can keep on giving 100% every day. I am burnt out. I&#039;m sick of trying and not getting anything in return. So I&#039;m going to stop trying. I give up. Fuck everything.

Meanwhile your friends can be going around and fucking all kinds of chicks but in all honesty that doesnt matter at all, life is about understanding yourself and making close bonds with a select few people around you.<br /><br />This is a lot of rambling but damn man talk it out, feel free to PM me if you don&#039;t want to do it publicly too

				It&#039;s ok to feel lonely sometimes :) <br /><br />We can give you advice on changing your life of course, like finding new companions, but becoming a blue animal is normal, think of it as a biological periodic performance review! It&#039;s perfectly natural to feel such a way, there&#039;s nothing wrong with you.

				- sit by yourself, shut out any noise, close doors etc, in silence, clear your mind of worry and stress, without thinking too hard about it<br />&nbsp; or forcing an answer, in solitude search and ask yourself honestly what makes you happy or content..<br />- it may take many attempts to realise.<br /><br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				cerealbox I recall reading your posts here and there and I always thought you seemed like a cool guy.&nbsp; You&#039;re on this site, so that already makes you more interesting than 95% of people.&nbsp; Maybe you have just not found the right friends yet...<br /><br />You have a job, do you have enough money to just drop everything and move to another place?&nbsp; What do you have to lose at this point?&nbsp; Radically changing your situation in life is worth a shot.&nbsp; It might feel very liberating to leave behind everything you&#039;ve been told to value (your job, status, women, what others think of you, etc.).<br /><br />Continue experimenting with the drugs available to you on this site, especially as it seems that legal meds have not worked for you so far.&nbsp; Try LSD, MDMA, Ketamine or even some good cocaine if you haven&#039;t yet.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you could find someone on this site who would be willing to act as a sort of online therapist while you&#039;re under the influence, especially if you would promise to do the same for them in return.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I see in another thread that you want to try LSD.&nbsp; Do you need some tabs?&nbsp; If you feel like trusting me, I&#039;ll put two in the mail for you tomorrow.&nbsp; Let me know if you need my public key...

				I think many of us know a thing or two about depression.&nbsp; Substances are a good tool to escape reality for a short time, just don&#039;t rely on them constantly or you&#039;ll quickly run out of cash and health.<br />You&#039;re definitely in the right place to kick depression in the nads.<br />Ketamine is being used to treat it these days... though acid is my sweet, sweet nectar of relief.<br />Trust me, a woman will not &quot;make&quot; you happy, you need to be comfortable with yourself.&nbsp; Women dig men who have confidence.<br />Don&#039;t worry so much about living at home though, lots of folks are doing it these days with the economic crisis BS going on.&nbsp; Hell, it&#039;s only really western countries that you see parents kicking their little bird out of the nest.&nbsp; In eastern cultures you see households of entire families living together to make ends meet and support each other.&nbsp; Enlightened I think.<br />I too am feeling somewhat burned out these days, it&#039;s like no matter how hard you try, there&#039;s always some asshole or situation waiting to suck you down into some pit of evil. The important thing to realize, just like when your tripping balls, is that most of this shit is in your head, and you can beat it with positive thinking and pornography.<br /><br />Oh, and if you&#039;re on antidepressants and you want to trip balls, stop taking them for a week beforehand.&nbsp; &nbsp;Those modern antidepressants can fuck with your trips.

I get this way every year around my birthday. I remember a particularly hopeful birthday. I quit smoking that year, got back in school, started working out, lost tens of pounds, got my teeth fixed etc. etc.<br /><br />Maybe some people just have to give up. Hope is a burden. It gets you through the hard times, but you have to drag it along the sludge to your death.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even know how I feel right now. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m just depressed because it&#039;s my birthday, or that for what I&#039;m told is not an ugly shell of a body I&#039;m unable to get laid, make meaningful connections with others, or have a good time.<br /><br />I want to live in a concrete box in the sky where everyone else is so I can make a human connection. I&#039;d like to take a girl back to my apartment and fuck her up the ass and call her a whore and make her swallow and do drugs. Then get drunk and go to sleep and go to work and school and tire myself out and be rewarded with a big juicy hamburger and a blowjob, but all I get is a lot of work at the gym and a sore body at the end of a long days work and I don&#039;t know what I can do for the economy and women hate me or don&#039;t want to date someone so far from the city or something.<br /><br />I feel like if I stop caring about what happens to me something will happen to me to make it all worth while. I feel like if I give up in life and stop giving a fuck then something good will happen. I don&#039;t know how it&#039;ll manifest. More drugs, perhaps. More forceful interactions with women, less social anixety, something. I dunno. But this was a year of irony for me. This past year has been me doing what in all outward appearances should make me happy, but I am not happy. I want to get the fuck out of this town, i want to bury my face in a burger and a pussy and a beer and fuck some ass and take some drugs and puke into a dark corner on a subway ride home with friends and get up the next day motivated about mergers or escrow or stocks or something. But I am alone. My life is repetitive. Boring. Unproductive.<br /><br />Hopefully some of that made sense, I did MXE and all it did was make me make less sense to people.<br />

				I was depressed for a time cerealbox. I saw a counselor and everything, but it didn&#039;t really help. I even had a girlfriend who I loved (and we&#039;re still together today) but I still had low self-esteem, I wasn&#039;t satisifed, etc. It was around that time that I first tried substances like MDMA, LSD, and mushrooms. They drastically improved my happiness and I thank them for curing my depression. So maybe try some psychedelics. I particularly recommend MDMA, just don&#039;t abuse it. I was able to limit myself to no more than once every 8 weeks and it worked well for me.<br /><br />Also try to have a positive outlook on life. Think of it this way: you know that in a year, your life will be different. And in 2 years even more different. And in 5 completely different, etc. The negativity you have now is bound to pass. I mean you have a job and friends, so it&#039;s not like your life is totally in the shit. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It&#039;s a cliche, but it&#039;s true. Keep getting by however you need. Maybe get an online dating profile or something. Don&#039;t expect to find a woman who will take anal and swallow when she blows you. Lower your standards a little, go for personality more than looks and sexual leniency. All will be healed in time, you have to remember that. Things have a way of improving. To this day I look back on the years when I was suicidal and I think, &quot;Really glad I didn&#039;t go through with it.&quot;

But it&#039;s an up and down thing, it&#039;ll turn around soon enough. An awesome new TV show will come on, you&#039;ll have a crazy trip, you&#039;ll find a nice young lady and stick it in her pooper or maybe you&#039;ll just have an excellent bowel movement and from then on things will start to look brighter.<br /><br /><br />

				oh yeah, the reason for finding that hot guy who is alone is to make a hot friend, you don;t want to be at &quot;the spot&quot; alone with no friends.&nbsp; people of the same sex as you tend to be more welcoming to talking to a new person<br /><br />Also, the cigarettes really help.&nbsp; If you have them, broke people will ask you for one.&nbsp; Give them one and TALK TO THEM!&nbsp; Now you made a connection.&nbsp; If he/she is just hanging out there too, you can stay there and talk.&nbsp; Eventually, you will be popular.<br /><br />popular people kick fucking ass.<br /><br />exchange numbers, remember faces, memorize their fucking face as best you can so you can say hello to them next time.<br /><br /><br />Also, when picking up chicks, if you start talking to somebody and they aren&#039;t that recptive, they aren&#039;t interested for one reason or another, don&#039;t take it personally, move on.&nbsp; Eventually somebody will be receptive, there you go, if you picked wisely, you are attracted to her.<br /><br />In order to make friends, get lovers, etc, you really have to make yourself have value to the other people.<br /><br />Just some friendly advice from a popular party monster.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although not strictly religious in the traditional sense I am very influenced by the<br />Eastern teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism and I subscribe to reincarnation: not so much as a scientific fact but as a useful metaphor which reminds us of our interconnectedness with the universe. I am not interested in trying to convert you to any religion but here are some observations from an Eastern perspective:<br /><br />The chances of being born into the human form is a trillion to one. As human&#039;s we have the potential to connect with the Divine spark and to finally break free from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). Take this rare opportunity to finally overcome all the suffering associated with the cycle of samsara. Much human suffering or depression is often the result of false identification with the self or the body and it&#039;s desires. Try to free yourself of the &#039;I&#039; &#039;Me&#039; and &#039;Mine&#039; either through meditation focused on your breathing or perhaps take some 2C-E to induce this state. 2C-E&nbsp; has been described as one of the most beneficial and introspective of&nbsp; psychedelics for this very purpose. Check Erowid for the glowing reports of users of this particular substance.<br />Magic mushrooms are also an ancient, beneficial and organic way of reconnecting with the Earth.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And if the &#039;Eastern&#039; perspective is not for you consider the conclusions of existentialism which is essentially this: we live in an absurd universe, &quot;God is dead&quot;, and it is up to each of us to define the meaning of our own lives or to use an expression from Nietzsche:&nbsp; we must &#039;overcome&#039; ourselves. A quote that I find very inspiring is this one from Thus Spoke Zarathustra which I can&#039;t recommend highly enough to anyone feeling blue:&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.&quot; (Prologue 3-4)<br /><br />Another useful quote from Nietzsche is this<br />&quot; The thought of suicide has gotten me through the worst of times.&quot; Meaning that as human&#039;s we have the freedom or choice to end our lives if we should so choose in less than a few minutes. However, never forget that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; If your depression is in anyway drug related (after all this is SilkRoad) and particularly if these drugs of choice are addictive in nature (Coke,Heroin,Meth) I highly recommend taking a break from that particular substance and either completely go on a detox (involving fasting, green tea,exercise, meditation,yoga, and vitamins) or use a substance like 2C-E or magic mushrooms to assist in authentic genuflecting . I suppose this is the more scientific approach of my 3 proposals to treating depression: realizing that our brains function primarily in relation to our bio-chemistry and adjusting yourself accordingly. You may also reach out to any family or friends for support.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Anyways bro, i have been a Social Worker and&nbsp; counselor for the last 2 decades and you are more than welcome to PM me anytime should you just wanna talk. Please do not do anything that is impulsive,ill-considered, or irreversible. Ever body gets depressed every now and then: what you are experiencing is completely normal and it will pass.<br /><br />Peace be with you.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />p.s. 2 pieces of music I would highly recommend is to help cure sadness is def John Coltrane&#039;s &#039;Love Supreme&#039; or the &#039;best hits&#039; of legendary blues musician &#039;Howling Wolf&#039;

To find one, I&#039;d suggest making friends with a girl who you don&#039;t want to have sex with (and then don&#039;t have sex with her). I do this all the time for my guy friends (I work with a lot of engineers who are, er, socially challenged and I&#039;ve hooked loads of them up). She&#039;ll have other friends she can introduce you too and someone in common means you can at least start a conversation with her (if confidence is an issue). Be wary if her friends start asking too many questions about her though, it means she fancies you and it&#039;ll all get messy.<br /><br />Alternatively go somewhere frequented by women and see if you can get chatting to any. You can use a play to do this (i.e. take your mums cute pug dog to the park and use it as a conversation starter) or just do it with confidence. Make idle chatter with the barista in your favorite coffee shop. Frequent the same places and get to know the staff. Go to a bar and chat your heart out to the bar staff (assuming it&#039;s a woman).<br /><br />OK, on to the good stuff, if you want a girl to do the &quot;dirty stuff&quot; with you (I&#039;m going to read the subtext of your posts and assume that that&#039;s what you want :P ) then you need to find a girl who&#039;ll be down for that. Usually women who take drugs are more likely to be open to the things that other women scoff at. But honestly, women do also like to do those things, and if you&#039;re a considerate lover they&#039;ll be more likely to give (i.e. if every night you demand steak and a good hard deep throat finished with a facial but then the best she gets all week is a kiss on the cheek and a bit of a fondle, she&#039;ll tell you to fuck off...if you make her squirt every time, she&#039;ll give you what you want!) And if you&#039;re in a relationship with her then don&#039;t demand it rough all the time, she&#039;ll want to know you care so at least once a week break out the massage oil or something.<br /><br />It&#039;s going to be difficult to find a girl who&#039;s going to admit to liking those things right out the gate - sorry. Society tells us it&#039;s dirty and we&#039;ll assume that by giving it to you right away you&#039;ll lose respect for us, or will have gotten your fill and ditch her. She may like to be called a whore but she definitely won&#039;t want you to reallllly think that after just meeting her. But once you&#039;ve found someone just approach the topic gently. <br /><br />In the meantime you could explore chatting online with people? Maybe webcam?<br /><br />God, I&#039;m going on, but I also wanted to say it gets better...I was on over 13 tablets a day up until last summer for mental health problems. Now I don&#039;t take any and I&#039;m the best I&#039;ve ever been. I had a lot of issues relating to sex/relationships and a difficult childhood (and it seems like you do too) and I wish I had a concrete answer as to why I got better but I don&#039;t, but I know that I definitely take a chance to smell the roses now and again. I like to break the monotony of life with things. <br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;d like more advice or to offload then hit me a PM...I think we&#039;re quite similar. I&#039;m a similar age, and my ideal relationship is one that&#039;s super sexual and includes a lot of drugs so I might be able to provide more of a female POV.

Do some drugs and get laid. I know how it is if you haven&#039;t got some.

				That&#039;s the point. On the outside my life should be fine. But I&#039;m not happy and for some reason women want nothing to do with me. I&#039;ve been doing online dating for the past year and I&#039;ve probably hit on close to a thousand women. None of them want anything to do with me. I work out, I&#039;m nice, I&#039;m smart, I have a personality. They won&#039;t even respond to my messages. And I should be happy any way. I&#039;m not. I can&#039;t find happiness no matter what I do. Every day is a struggle to keep slogging one more day at a time, despite the fact that life should be fine. I just don&#039;t have it in me to keep trying. I&#039;ve done every thing right and the universe won&#039;t give me a break. This website is the closest thing to a break I&#039;ve ever gotten actually and for this website I&#039;m eternally grateful. But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s cutting it.<br /><br />tl;dr<br /><br />of course I should be happy. that&#039;s the point. I&#039;m not. I do everything right and nothing I do is good enough.

				I know you may have heard this before? But why not give internet dating a shot, I know plenty of people in their 30&#039;s who are in the same position as you, they just can&#039;t seem to meet the right person, On-line dating gets you out and about, you get to practice &#039;people&#039; skills and you&#039;ll probably get laid too... <br /><br />You need to unplug now and again. from real life, and from the net... The key is balance, as with everything in life!! <br />Everything in moderation... Everything!<br /><br />Chin up mate... My best mate went 6 years with not even a sniff! He&#039;s getting back on the horse now though, and his social skills are somewhat lacking (I.E - First date, drinks over 6 pints and wonders why his date left early)<br /><br />Hope this helps.. You need to gain some perspective, try and look at your situation and see the best bits, rather than the worst!

				Ok i got something i want you to try. <br />1.Get a drug that is a stimulant. MDPV is pretty cheap or 4fa. Really any type of stimulant that produces euphoria and makes you want more after you are high.<br /><br />2.Do some of those drugs in front of the girl you want to hook up with. Only share a little bit and act like you don&#039;t want to. (Even though you don&#039;t mind sharing.) <br /><br />3. When she starts coming down she&#039;ll want more. This is where you act like a stingy asshole complaining about how you only have a little bit and you already shared. She&#039;ll be really sweet and flirty wanting more. If she overs to buy it off you. Say you don&#039;t want to sale because it&#039;s your last bit. (even if it&#039;s not.) <br /><br />Then, tell her if she wants more, she&#039;ll have to dance for it. She might look at you like what the fuck? Just laugh and tell her your serious. You wouldn&#039;t believe how many times this has worked for me. Even if she just does a playful dance, and not a sexy one. It puts attention on her, let&#039;s her know you find her attractive. If she does a good job of dancing, then give her some more. Then work your way from there. <br /><br />The reason i say ask her to dance. It&#039;s not as rude as asking her to fuck for drugs lol. It also helps her loosen up and allows her to be more comfortable with acting like herself around you. The more comfortable she feels, the more likely hood you have of getting laid. <br /><br />This might make me sound like a pig, but i had a friend who attempted suicide. Thank god they were able to get him to the hospital and pump his stomach in time. I told him to do the what i told you after he got out of the hospital. I think he used cocaine as his choice of stimulant. He ended up getting some and he&#039;s doing a lot better. He thanked me for that and told me about how he hadn&#039;t been laid in over six months before that night. <br /><br />I&#039;m telling you, it&#039;s in our nature to fuck. It&#039;s something we have to do to continue feeling like are life is meaningful. And, who knows. The girl you get to dance, you might really connect with and they might turn out to be your soul mate. (If you believe in that kind of thing.)<br /><br />Sometimes you just need to get laid, no matter what the cost. No matter how much of an asshole you seem lol. <br /><br />Then again, i might just be an asshole haha.

You can seek out weak girls with mental problems and have sex with them tonight and wake up disgusted with them and yourself, or you can spend months or years improving yourself enough to win the love of a kind, brave, smart, courageous girl you really adore.<br /><br />I got knocked down by life two years ago and I&#039;m still getting out of the ditch. It sucks. But I try to make time to do stuff that really makes me happy, even if it&#039;s obvious it&#039;s a &quot;waste&quot; of time (when people say this, they usually mean it doesn&#039;t help your career). But it&#039;s not a waste of time if it&#039;s making you happy.<br /><br />I think you should rethink and accept that whatever you&#039;ve been doing has not really been right, at least not right for winning at life by getting happiness. Use your strong brain to change your habits to unashamedly gather up happiness like it&#039;s gold, wherever it may be found.

				Thanks for your concern everyone. I&#039;m feeling better these days. I guess it really was just turning 26 that made me depressed. Life is getting better the more I work at it, it&#039;ll just take some patience.<br /><br />Oh yeah, not to mention that giving up enabled me to change my profile to something honest and open (such as the fact that I love drugs and am looking for someone into kinky sex) which has gotten me a first date with an awesome girl next week.

Its hard to recognize the problem.&nbsp; And frankly most people perscribing these psychoactives do not know what they are doing.&nbsp; <br /><br />What you need to do i find the right psychiatrist.&nbsp; One who knows her drugs well.&nbsp; You need to carefully and slowly try different therapies, dosage, combos and keep steady notes.&nbsp; Have&nbsp; goal as to what you think you need to fix with you mental/emotional health.&nbsp; Keep track of which drugs help you get there and which push you in the wrong direction or have bad side effects.<br /><br />As per the SR substances.&nbsp; Avoid anything addictive.&nbsp; One poster mentioned cocain.&nbsp; DO NOT GET INTO COKE DUDE&gt;&nbsp; Its very addictive.&nbsp; Stick to the drugs w/o withdrawal and ones that could interact with whatever else you&#039;ve been perscribed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to find a pdoc that&#039;s open to a patient using mushroom/lsd/and other psychedelics.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never done those.&nbsp; But i&#039;ve found that my prescribed meds, supplements and an occasional toke of cannabis do everything i need. <br /><br />Today I&#039;d say i&#039;m functioning almost as good as when i was a teenager, and emotionally much more balanced than ive ever been even going back to childhood.<br /><br />Try to remain positive, if i had to play armchair pdoc, i&#039;d say you are suffering from some depression.&nbsp; Your perspective seems very negative and hopeless.&nbsp; Consider trying some 5-htp (over the counter, but be carefull because it acts essentially like an SSRI in some, and if you are taking ssri&#039;s you should cut your dosage for a week or two before trying it).<br /><br />You may also need a mood stabilizer (ant-psychotic) which act on dopamine.&nbsp; Abilify works great if its a depression thing along with an ssri.&nbsp; The zyprexa (olanzapine) i take is great if your symptoms are unstable mood with big ups and downs and getting upset and emotional easily.<br /><br />Lastly, listen to me dude, ive been there, the dark places where you feel hopeless.&nbsp; I was once a scary looking homeless dude in my truck.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m not scary to people, i don&#039;t mumble to myself constantly, and i&#039;m not looking to off myself.<br /><br />Right now i&#039;m working a crap job, but i feel good about my future in the long term.<br /><br />Find a friend or relative or pastor or whoever you feel you can talk about these things with.&nbsp; And outside perspecitve is important.&nbsp; Ask people close to you what they think your challenges are, what they think could be wrong with you.&nbsp; You sound like you simply might be sick, you can be fixed.&nbsp; If i can, if my bipolar therapist who was so delusional when he was a teen would wonder off pretending he was filming a movie for days can be fixed, you can too!&nbsp; Takes time and the right people helping.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give up!

				Cerealbox, it appears you&#039;ve been given some great advice. Particularly from war, aligibbs, and trippyskies. I&#039;d +1 you guys if I could, not that it actually means anything... but I wanted to say you three had a combination of some good stuff. Violence isn&#039;t the answer, but blowing off some steam like that does prove effective sometimes, so you could go try and find a fight club, but chances are you won&#039;t, since nobody will break the first rule. :P<br /><br />DigitalEntity forgot: &quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&quot; Sounds like you&#039;ve been collecting some moss, buddy. <br /><br />I&#039;d offer some of my thoughts but as I said I think war/aligibbs/trippyskies pretty much nailed it. Hope things are getting brighter for you. Happy birthday, and it&#039;s good to hear you got yourself a date!<br /><br />ps. Yes, cocaine is a TERRIBLE idea, might as well get on some H too, and woo, problems solved!!! For a month or two. Then you&#039;re really fucked.

A hidden discontentment that&#039;s there whenever I think about it, but that I can sufficiently distract myself from. Hope keeps me going. I was much, much happier when I had a girlfriend (I don&#039;t believe in this you don&#039;t need a man/woman to be happy stuff; we&#039;re social creatures). I hope that I can find a good girlfriend, and eventually college won&#039;t suck so much once I transfer and hopefully I can get a good job and live on my own and then the lingering will go away. But when an occasion comes around to take stock of how I feel, I don&#039;t feel satisfied. Hopefully if I can manage to stay motivated and stay positive I can shake was has so far been a life without joy and finally make it worth living.

				Cerealbox,<br /><br />Just wanted to make a couple of comments regarding your state of mind...<br /><br />You seem to place uber-importance on having a partner, like you need one to complete you somehow, but this is really not the case at all.&nbsp; Two people do not complete one another- they compliment one another.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t that you NEED the other half of a circle to complete your half, it&#039;s that you need to complete your own circle on your own.&nbsp; Eventually, you&#039;ll meet someone who is a complete circle independent of anyone else, and you two will form concentric circles that compliment one another in a way you never imagined.<br /><br />Be your own person.&nbsp; Find your own way.&nbsp; Develop your own interests, and foster the development of them.&nbsp; Right now, you seem to be predicating your own happiness on the acceptance of you by another person.&nbsp; You need to learn to be happy on your own.&nbsp; Otherwise, you project your own unhappiness, and even your desperation, to those same women you want to interact with.&nbsp; These qualities are universally regarded as unattractive (not saying you are personally- only the aura you project)<br /><br />Attraction is a force all its own.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t rational, can&#039;t be controlled or directed.&nbsp; It can seldom even be denied.&nbsp; Women do not choose who they are attracted to- they just are, or they are not.&nbsp; Happy, content, complete people project an aura of confidence- which most definitely IS universally accepted as being an attractive quality...<br /><br />Do you see what I&#039;m getting at?&nbsp; It might take a long, long time to find what you think you so desperately want RIGHT NOW...&nbsp; Maybe even a lifetime.&nbsp; But it doesn&#039;t mean that you can&#039;t be, or shouldn&#039;t be, a complete and happy person in the interim.&nbsp; Focus on yourself, but be sensitive to the needs and expectations of those around you.&nbsp; It WILL happen as soon as you stop looking for it...<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that you&#039;ll find what you&#039;re looking for simply BECAUSE you stop looking for it, or immediately after.&nbsp; But when you stop focusing on having a relationship, you have all that time to focus on completing yourself- and you&#039;ll be a happier person because of it.&nbsp; When that transformation happens, people will begin to look at you in a different light, and the rules of attraction will change.

				Life is what you make it.<br /><br />Take a trip to your local ghetto, or better yet, take a trip to a burgeoning metropolis in a 2nd or 3rd world country. That will put shit in perspective. It will humble you to your very core to see people who literally have nothing, to see people who can&#039;t even control their own lives, their own destinies.<br /><br />You&#039;re lucky you can choose to better yourself like you did, you&#039;re lucky you have the CHOICE to be able to go to school and get your teeth fixed.<br /><br />You&#039;re lucky your only problems are trying to get laid and finding a life partner and making friends.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to worry about finding food, eating the most disgusting things with relish because you can&#039;t afford anything else, things we throw away and take for granted.<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to worry about fighting for your own god damned survival, like animals forced into confines with each other, killing each other for scraps, dying from disease, malnourishment and dehydration because there is NO FOOD, NO CLEAN WATER, and NO MEDICAL ANYTHING, not even bandages or the simple pills in a bottle we take for granted to take away a headache.<br /><br />But you can&#039;t get an idea just from my words, you can&#039;t get an idea from seeing the sad &#039;donate a meal to starving African children&#039; commercials where you quickly avert your eyes or quickly change the channel so you don&#039;t feel the shame or guilt of seeing fellow human beings in such a horrid state of being.<br /><br />You have to see it with your own eyes, and I believe you should. Walking down the street of a small town, with no running water, no electricity on a hot 40c day and 80% humidity, a small trench for your shit and piss runs parallel to the street, spreading disease and horrible smell, polluting the only sources of water around for miles, mounds and mounds of trash piled on the corner of every alleyway, smelling like death incarnate because there is no one to pick it up, sweltering there in the heat for months. Ramshackle houses that are occupied by families so large, you can&#039;t decyfer the lineage, built from the refuse of other nations into something resembling a residency.<br /><br />Nope, all you have to worry about is your self image, what shoes you&#039;re gonna wear today, which girl you are going to try and impress with your knowledge and witty jokes. <br /><br />1st world life is about competition, professionally, personally, sexually, spiritually. You must try and make yourself the best you can be so people will like you. That&#039;s what all the media tells us right? <br /><br />Life... is about competition. And I&#039;d say life is pretty fucking good.

				Just like the others have said, try you out some psychadelics. Mushrooms are my favorite by far when it comes to figuring out how to proceed. You get to see the world, and yourself, from a different perspective. One without preconceived ideas, or any trace of your own ego. (which can be a little frightening to some).<br /><br />Or, you could just go kick the fuck out of someone like Limitless said. It really feels good, if they deserved it.

				Not quite sure how I was trying to make him feel bad about his life.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to show him that his life, in fact, is not that bad. Quite the opposite actually.<br /><br />I was in his same shoes and what I just wrote is how I got over it. And I never forgot it.<br /><br />It has helped me remind myself everyday, that despite the petty shit we see in our day to day lives, things could be so much worse.<br /><br />SO much worse.<br /><br />Edit: and how is my suggestion so much worse than the people saying go beat someone up, or the guy who is clearly a PUA saying go party and become popular? or the guy who said to blackmail a girl into having sex with him for drugs.<br /><br />They&#039;re all opinions anyway.

Although I completely agree with what you said.<br /><br />I especially like the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Nope, all you have to worry about is your self image, what shoes you&#039;re gonna wear today, which girl you are going to try and impress with your knowledge and witty jokes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yet, as I said, just looking around at the bad in the world while you&#039;re at your all time low isn&#039;t too positive. It only seems to help while you&#039;re at your at a good point in your life. It may help you see the good things you have while you compare your life with others. Just IMO isn&#039;t good while you aren&#039;t doing good, at least it wouldn&#039;t help me.<br /><br />Honestly OP, if you feel like you&#039;re giving up, stop trying to please anyone else. Stop trying to set out to get these little personal goals and just go out and figure yourself out. Change something. Change your lifestyle, surroundings, do whatever you can that isn&#039;t like you are now. Obviously you&#039;re not happy with everything you have around currently, so change it completely and go from there. It may seem dramatic, but if you&#039;ve really given up on everything, you have nothing to lose.

				It&#039;s all good. Like I said, these are all suggestions by people who have been in the same situation. <br /><br />Cerealbox should read this and come to a solution that works for him, either by trying out the suggestions made, or analyzing all of it and coming up with his own ideas.<br /><br />Everything I said worked for me, as I&#039;m sure the stuff others have said worked for them.<br /><br />I wish Cerealbox the best and hopes he finds what hes looking for.<br /><br />I do know that what he&#039;s looking for wont be found in a vagina though.<br /><br />Or maybe it is, ahaha.

Plus, there&#039;s no competition here so the entire market is mine!<br /><br />My advice is move to a third world country (In Africa preferably) and start dealing - not one at a time, get mules to do the shit work for you! :D Get connected and make lots of CA$H!!!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />The Godfather

I read alot of mystery shit, and some juggler shit, and a bunch of other random shit. Watched videos. There&#039;s an endless amount of PUA material out there. It gets hard to filter the quality from the crap, but I&#039;ve at least skimmed most of it.<br /><br />I feel like I understand much more about the topic than most people do, even &quot;naturals,&quot; the guys who do it without knowing it.<br /><br />To my dismay, I still can&#039;t make it work in real life.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even understand why. I&#039;m good looking, understand everything in theory, but the practical applications of this knowledge still eludes me.
