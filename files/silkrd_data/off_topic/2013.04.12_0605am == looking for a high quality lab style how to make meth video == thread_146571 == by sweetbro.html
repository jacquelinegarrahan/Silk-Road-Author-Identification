				everybody has seen all the great videos on how to grow your own dope that go on for hours.. ive downloaded stacks of them.<br /><br />but i want to watch a really nice quality video of proper, professional lab style synthesis of methamphetamine.. something in depth.. not a bunch of 3 minute shake and bake videos but something that would be about an hour and give you a good look into ways it can be made in a proper chemistry environment.<br /><br />im not going to get one video and run out and start making it. i just learn better visually than by reading the documents online and documents are dangerous to learn off.. making meth is definately not something id jump into.. theres probobly no chance id attempt to make it with taking some form of chemistry education anyway.. essentially im not planning to make it but i do have the fantasy of making meth and i&#039;d like a resource to start with..&nbsp; &nbsp;but these types of video seems impossible to find.. i just want to see something that is long, detailed and uses lab equipment.. even if its just for visual titilation<br /><br /><br />do videos like these even exist? surely thee&#039;s got to be at least one good one!

				I don&#039;t think I have seen one single post of yours where you actually knew what the fuck you&#039;re talking about, Jediknight.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry man, I let it go usually, but Jesus fucking Christ dude -- if you don&#039;t know something, don&#039;t fucking answer the question as if you have all the facts.&nbsp; You&#039;re wrong every goddamn time; in fact it&#039;s so fucking often that it almost seems deliberate.<br /><br />His answer is fucking bullshit, sweetbro.&nbsp; I mean like every fucking word of it.&nbsp; Do a search for Rhodium&#039;s Chemistry Site archive or maybe The Hive.&nbsp; Used to be good sources of cooking tutorials; The Hive in particular dealt primarily with meth.&nbsp; All text or HTML though.<br /><br />Afraid I don&#039;t know of any videos, though there is one thing I can tell you: it ain&#039;t quite as easy as throwing a bunch of shit into a soda bottle and shaking for an hour.&nbsp; You don&#039;t wanna try any kind of Shake&#039;n Bake, if you do it that way you&#039;ll set yourself on fire someday (really, it&#039;ll happen eventually).&nbsp; Also, read up on it.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Then read some more.&nbsp; It&#039;s not brain surgery, but they are dangerous chemicals and you do need to know how to handle them and what to do if things go bad.<br /><br />Good luck, and again, ignore Yoda.

				Seriously though,<br /><br />Check out the regular Internet .&nbsp; You won&#039;t find videos on the TOR network.&nbsp; It&#039;s too slow to stream video over encryption. That&#039;s why there is very few videos on onion sites.&nbsp; So you may be looking in the wrong place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, he law loves busting servers for hosting illegal videos like this.&nbsp; So, who will host such a video with bandwidth needs like that and high risk. . . It would have to be for sale.&nbsp; &nbsp;For free, you don&#039;t get much but text files written by god knows who. <br /><br />But of course, some smart ass will come here and write you some bullshit and not provide any help to you after writing a lot of text.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just tryin to help

				The best material i&#039;ve ever seen for meth production is Uncle Festers line of books, I have the 8th edition in .pdf and it goes into every minute detail you could possibly need.<br /><br />http://www.unclefesterbooks.com/<br /><br />He also has a 2 hour DVD - &quot;Cookin&#039; Crank with Uncle Fester&quot;. All of his products are available to purchase on the site.<br /><br />&quot;In this tape / dvd, I extract ephedrine pills from the gas station and pseudoephedrine pills from the grocery store to get pure feed for making meth. I then proceed with an HI reduction to meth using sodium hypophosphite as a source for hypophosphorous acid. I use both pure sodium hypophosphite and electroless nickel plating solution as a source of sodium hypophosphite for this reaction. Red phosphorus, the standard co-reactant with HI is now getting very difficult to obtain. The tape concludes with a 10 gram meth batch, isolation and purification of the product as hydrochloride crystals, and party fun.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=146571.msg1005285#msg1005285">Quote from: sweetbro on April 12, 2013, 06:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...documents are dangerous to learn off...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Also, I completely disagree with this, what do you think scholars of years gone by learned from?

				So, I don&#039;t know that particular video, but I recognize the name unclefester... and I can&#039;t recall if he&#039;s as bad as the Phrack &quot;cooks&quot; or not.&nbsp; Well, whatever, maybe that works and maybe it doesn&#039;t -- as far as I know those materials are no longer possible to obtain legally / unwatched (as in they monitor sales of them very strictly).&nbsp; So it&#039;s probably not going to do you a whole lot of good.<br /><br />First of all, I&#039;m certainly not a chemist.&nbsp; I have very little education in the way of chemistry, but amphetamine is one molecule I happen to know a little about; you should still take what I say with a grain of salt though.<br /><br />One of the two easiest/best-known methods is reduction of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine to methamphetamine.&nbsp; This is accomplished by hydrogen iodide, also known as hydroiodic acid.&nbsp; It&#039;s a powerful reducing agent that&#039;s used in production of various chemicals, but I know fuck all about that industry, so, moving right along.&nbsp; Hyroiodic acid can be generated in the reaction vessel itself by combining red phosphorous, iodine crystals, water, and heating them (heating as in like 100-200 degrees celsius).<br /><br />The hydroiodic acid is combined with red phosphorous.&nbsp; The reason for this is that as the acid reduces the ephedrine molecules to amphetamine molecules, the acid itself is consumed and separates into constituent pieces -- those pieces aren&#039;t a powerful reduction agent.&nbsp; By adding the red phosphorous combined with heat and what the acid decomposes into, another chemical reaction is caused and the hydroiodic acid is regenerated and can again reduce ephedrine to amphetamine.&nbsp; So it keeps the process going and helps increase yield (50-75% of the ephedrine ending up as amphetamine is what 50-75% yield means).<br /><br />The entire process is pretty mechanical: you combine the iodine, red phosphorous, and water in your reaction vessel -- which is a glass beaker.&nbsp; Really anything that can take the heat and the strong acid is usable though (like a coffee pot -- get creative).&nbsp; Then you add the heat, and when it looks good, you dump in the ephedrine and fit the container with a condenser, aka reflux condenser.&nbsp; The simplest condenser is a Leibniz (Leipzig?) condenser, which is just a glass tube.&nbsp; They&#039;re set up with a chamber that you run water or antifreeze or whatever liquid through.<br /><br />The reason for that is that because you&#039;re heating this stuff past the boiling point of H2O, so a lot of stuff starts evaporating into vapor and tries to drift away on its own somewhere.&nbsp; Very rude stuff, that vapor.&nbsp; The condenser and circulating water are at the neck of the beaker so that vapor has to drift through them.&nbsp; As it does, the heat is sucked out of the vapor, which causes it to condense back into drops of liquid that drip back down into the reaction vessel (as if those scum deserve freedom -- hmph!).<br /><br />So you just let this happen for 1-24 hours.&nbsp; It should be watched, especially at larger volumes -- I read that it can get out of hand unexpectedly and very fast, so don&#039;t leave it overnight on its own.<br /><br />Then after the cook is all done and you&#039;ve got your honey (it&#039;s often honey colored at this point, hence why meth freebase is called honey), you just need to attach the hydrochloride salt to those amphetamine molecules and then pop those suckers right inside of you.&nbsp; That&#039;s just as long a writeup, and I&#039;m not sure I even remember the details properly anymore, so I&#039;m gonna skip it.&nbsp; It&#039;s a totally standard process though -- see next paragraph.<br /><br />SO...!&nbsp; What have we all learned today, peoplez?<br /><br />- Well we&#039;ve learned that generally the process of cooking methamphetamine involves reducing a closely related molecule via a reduction agent such as hydroiodic acid (usually hydrogen iodide is what you call the gaseous form, not the liquid one, but they&#039;re the same thing).&nbsp; Ephedrine is such a related molecule.<br /><br />- We learned that a condenser and a steady flow of water are used as cooling agents to prevent our product from drifting away uselessly.<br /><br />- We learned you can use coffee pots instead of high quality borosillicate glass (labware is usually made of borosillicate glass: it&#039;s better at withstanding high heat but breaks more easily).<br /><br />- We&#039;re now learning that the steps after the cook, as in once you&#039;ve got your meth freebase and are ready to attach the HCl salt to it (it makes it more stable, otherwise it breaks down or doesn&#039;t get absorbed in the body as well upon ingestion), you just follow a process called acid-base extraction followed by titration.&nbsp; Or is it the other way around... well they&#039;re like first year chem stuff anyway, very easy to find how-to&#039;s online.<br /><br /><br />The actual payoff to this post<br />==================<br /><br />- So why did I bother writing this shit?&nbsp; So that you&#039;d all understand why you don&#039;t need a specific &quot;how to cook meth&quot; video.&nbsp; What you NEED is a &quot;redux reaction&quot; video.&nbsp; Not to be confused with redox.&nbsp; Or... whatever the other one is.&nbsp; It&#039;s redux, like reduction. <br /><br />- Now you also know what the condenser is for, so look up a video on how to &quot;reflux with a condenser&quot; and you&#039;ll get that part taught to you.<br /><br />- So after those two videos are finished, you&#039;d theoretically have your honey.&nbsp; So now you want to look up &quot;acid-base extractions&quot;, &quot;titration&quot;, and &quot;recrystallization&quot; videos.<br /><br />... and voila!!!!&nbsp; You have meth.&nbsp; Or some disgusting rubbish that nobody&#039;s going to want to buy because you fucked it up and didn&#039;t actually get any meth out of the whole ordeal.&nbsp; Total failure is common.&nbsp; Yields as low as 20-40% are common.&nbsp; Breaking Bad isn&#039;t full of it apparently, I mean 90% yields are extremely rare for clandestine chemists to see.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know the theoretical maximum off the top of my head.<br /><br /><br />Oh, some people are selling P2NP on the Road, aren&#039;t they.&nbsp; Well that&#039;s phenyl-2-nitro-propamine (I think that&#039;s right, but w/e) and it used to be a very common precursor for meth production.&nbsp; It&#039;s a similar process, but I don&#039;t know that one; it also involves an extra step or two to create the meth molecule.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically the same thing though, just with an added step or two to convert to amphetamine.<br /><br />You gotta look that up on your own though if you want to learn it.

it also involves an extra step or two to create the meth molecule.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically the same thing though, just with an added step or two to convert to amphetamine.<br /><br />You gotta look that up on your own though if you want to learn it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />cheers the way youve written that is top notch for a newbie that wants to learn.. you gave lots of phrases to search for.. i appreciate the way you gave us some better keywords and phrases to search for so we can seek other more effective paths of knowledge instead of the instant gratification &quot;how to make meth&quot; searches. those phrases you gave are like &quot;marijuana seeds of knowledge&quot; .... what you can learn about is growing a vegie patch and if you ever wanted to grow weed you already got some gardening skills so you dont fetilise ur marijuna plants to death or end up digging too deep a hole and falling in it and killing yourself.<br /><br />+1 if i could give it
