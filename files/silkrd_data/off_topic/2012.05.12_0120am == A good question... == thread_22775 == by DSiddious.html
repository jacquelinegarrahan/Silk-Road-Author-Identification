				Misery is a business. The government couldn&#039;t actually give two shits about keeping people off of drugs, they simply want to keep people on their drugs. They invent a new bullshit psychological disorder every day it seems. The guys in charge want to pump everyone full of anti-depressants and have them carry on with their boring cookie-cutter lives unquestioningly. It&#039;s all a business move. The people with the power to end the war on drugs DO know that it&#039;s a total failure, and they are perfectly aware that many of these substances are not even harmful to the human body. They just don&#039;t care. People having access to recreational drugs, especially those that don&#039;t cause bodily harm, is just bad for business. Imagine what it would do to the people on wall street if suddenly people started realizing that there is more to life than saving up to buy a slightly smaller and more glossy version of the same cellular phone every year? <br /><br />They want to bleed us dry. The &quot;What right do you have to regulate what I put in my own body&quot; argument, while completely valid, falls on deaf ears. If something exists that will stray people away from pumping their money into big business, the suits in charge will try to take it away from us.

Special interest money that goes toward funding elected officials in public office is only one small part of government. There are vast bureaucracies within government and career officials whose positions have nothing to do with elected office.

				ron paul has some personal religious opinions, that tend to make me laugh at him.&nbsp; but, in the political arena, i wish the media wasn&#039;t black balling him.&nbsp; he is a true&nbsp; constitutionalist, and really wants to radically change this country, back to where it should be.&nbsp; i don&#039;t think that will happen.&nbsp; but, at least his son is in the senate, and might be able to carry the tourch.&nbsp; some of his views are laughable as well, but again, he&#039;s an advocate of personal freedom, and small government.&nbsp; these two beliefs need to spread like wildfire.&nbsp; fuck religious opinion. any assclown that gets on a religious soapbox for governmental campaigns doesn&#039;t deserve a vote.&nbsp; church and state are suppised to be seperate.&nbsp;

The second amendment is enshrined in the constitution and i&#039;ve seen NOTHING in recent years to support the claim that any politician is scheming or is remotely capable of amending the constitution to remove this right. Not to mention it would be impossible to pull off given the power the NRA has as a de facto blackops lobbying force in Washington. It&#039;s not going to happen. And politicians of all stripes are too concerned with their own survival to dare crossing the NRA and thus have been kowtowing to them for years. More often than not, I see this theory pushed by self serving gun store owners wanting to maximize profits and many of their diehard patrons instilling a little paranoia that the gov is going to take away your guns so you might as well stockpile them now.

He believes in total private sector control of markets with NO government interference or regulation. Do you have any idea what implies?<br /><br />What do you think Wall Street would do without the SEC to regulate them? If you want the country to return to the 19th century when corporate monopolies and their private pinkerton militias controlled commercial industries, then yeah, Ron Paul and his radical laissez-faire economics will do that. But the country didn&#039;t begin to become a global economic force until guys like Teddy Roosevelt came in and busted up all the monopolies to encourage market competition. Without gov regulation, just like the abuses that would happen in wall street, that would give corporations the green light to collude and price fix while ignoring safety regulations and employing child labor to produce their products as cheaply as possible to maximize profit. It would be a disaster.

				The supply of ammo wouldn&#039;t need to drastically decrease for ammo prices to go up. If you understand supply and demand, the price is also sensitive to an increase in demand. Obama&#039;s election had a HUGE affect on demand from gun loons thinking he was going to take away their ammo. It affected the price then, just as it&#039;s affecting the price now and is bound to affect the price more should he be re-elected. <br /><br />Also, the effect on supply from being at war is not going to only affect he price of rounds that are used by the military. The same materials are used in the manufacturing process for ammunition whether they&#039;re used for military issue or not. Scarcity in material used to produce ammunition because of massive increase in demand from going to war is going to affect the entire industry, not just specific rounds.

There will be antiquated ideas in destructive policies, such as the present War on Drugs, that require activism and tons of effort to mobilize the masses to demand a change in policy. Sometimes, even in a democracy, government does NOT represent the will and best interests of the people. And the demands of its citizens are sometimes best expressed by acts of mass disobedience and protest.

The analgesic properties are better for the rx drugs, as opposed to heroin, in many cases.

				Drugs should remain illegal, Heroine in particular. If a person decides to try heroine then fine actively go out and find it to use. Nobody should argue that this is anything but a personal right. But if you legalize it then people have more access to it, resulting in more addicts and more shit that come with it. H has a blood trail back to the 20&#039;s and even&nbsp; further. Diamorphine is a not a killer on its the combination of the shit they cut it with that fucks your shit up.

In fact, you even bring up a contradiction yourself in trying to point out that legalization would be &quot;stupid&quot;. The &quot;blood trail&quot; you mention that goes back to the 20&#039;s, is due more to the stuff they cut it with. So if it had been legal, according to your own logic, there wouldn&#039;t be the &quot;blood trail&quot; that you&#039;re playing up in order to demonize it.<br /><br />In 2000, Portugal had resounding success in decriminalizing hard drugs. By spending money instead on education and prevention, it cut down significantly on the number of OD&#039;s and spread of HIV.&nbsp; Heroin also lost its rebel allure of illegality that sucks in many young people into trying it and instead became a deadbeat pursuit. <br /><br />Similarly, Switzerland a few years back decided to try a new tact in which heroin addicts were just given as much pure H as they wanted. They were given it at state sponsored centers where the administration could be monitored for good hygiene and such. Once again, it cut down on diseases and OD&#039;s. It was also remarkable in that, once the addicts were given all they wanted and no longer spent all day trying to hook up heroin, many reported going through an existential crises because they then had to figure out what they wanted to do with their lives. This led to some addicts deciding to take charge and live productive lives with some finally getting off it completely. Nor did it lead to a significant rise in heroin addiction. It still had a bad rap where no one had any desire of joining the zombies in the state sanctioned heroin depots. <br /><br />So I think your idea that legalization is &quot;stupid&quot; is dated and based on an antiquated paradigm. Legalization in practice has demonstrated itself to be anything but &quot;stupid&quot;.<br /><br />
