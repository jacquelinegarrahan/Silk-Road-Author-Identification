				Sorry if this is in the wrong place, wasn&#039;t quite sure where to put it. Well anyways, I bought a Moneypak, I realize Vanilla Reload seems more popular so I tried but they said I had to have a prepaid card with me to activate it so I just gave up on that and got a MoneyPak. This isn&#039;t for me, a few friends wanted me to make an order for them and gave me $30 so I got 25 on the card. Most vendors won&#039;t do under 100. Vendors that will do &gt;100 seem to be new, sketchy, and have either what looks like fake feedback or no feedback, I&#039;ve been fucked over by a scammer with fake feedback for $80 in the past so I don&#039;t want to risk that again. Is there a vendor who is trusted, with no minimum, and a small fee? I already have money in my account btw so that&#039;s the reason for the card funds being so low. I&#039;ve searched but most of these vendors won&#039;t accept my card or seem risky. If anyone has any experience with vendors who don&#039;t require a minimum, or if anyone who is trusted here would be able to process this card for me, I&#039;d appreciate it. Sorry, I know no one hear likes dealing with MoneyPak.
