				Just checked the link provided here, and BMR is back up again, enter at your choosing, I personally will never purchase from there (I don&#039;t like the fact their vendors accounts are free, which pretty much opens up the floodgates for scammers), but as Ballzinator says there may be a few good genuine offers there if you keep your wits about you. Personally it&#039;s not for me, but if it&#039;s right for you, go for it. For as long as SilkRoad is in existence and prospering, I shall remain loyal&nbsp; :)

				Yes, the SR is better - when it is running.<br /><br />You get the same level of service from me there as you do here. There, proof that not everything on BMR is a scam.

				Didn&#039;t read any of this thread really but I can already mention the most important difference between SR and BMR.<br /><br />BMR uses pre-existing software that was modified for site. SR uses in-house software built from the ground up with security and anonymity the highest priorities.<br /><br />That&#039;s it; nothing else really matters at all.

				Nothing wrong with BMR you just need to take a long time finding out whos legit and not a scammer. Ive set up an account there, its very quiet but ive had one sale. SR is better, my account there is incase theirs downtime here. There does seem to be a lot of legit finnish sellers/ buyers, dont know why that is.
