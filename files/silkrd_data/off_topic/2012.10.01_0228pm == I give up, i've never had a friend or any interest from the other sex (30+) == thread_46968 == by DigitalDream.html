				I&#039;m in my 30&#039;s, have 2 university degree&#039;s yet have never had a single friend in my entire life, no one will speak to me, those that have immediately leave.<br /><br />I feel absolutely worthless as i&#039;m in my 30&#039;s and no woman has EVER flirted with me, shown any sign of interest in me, and when I put forth the effort i&#039;ve been shot down EVERY SINGLE TIME (at least 100 attempts in my lifetime).<br /><br />I&#039;ve &#039;attempted&#039; suicide twice this year and not a single person noticed, cared, some laughed.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been through 8 years of therapy ... which does not fix being worthless.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently sleeping pretty much all day every day so I don&#039;t actually commit suicide because it&#039;s VERY easy to do (I don&#039;t know how people &#039;attempt&#039; it other then to try and get some validation that someone is aware of you and gives even the slightest ioda of a shit, which didn&#039;t happen to me).<br /><br />I&#039;m now ready to give up on this sleeping all the time and just commit suicide, I mean who in their&nbsp; lives has never had a friend and NEVER had anyone of the opposite sex show any interest in them even in the slightest?&nbsp; I&#039;m not talking about sex either, i&#039;m talking about relationship&#039;s, someone caring for you.<br /><br />Why am i even asking this forum, not like anyone here cares or has any reason to care.&nbsp; I am not moonbear, just a very suicidal man prepared and ready to end it (PS: i&#039;m not fat, an ordinary looking person and have 2 physical science degree&#039;s so i&#039;m not stupid).&nbsp; WHY DOES NOBODY&nbsp; CARE?

				Solitude sure is a terrible thing. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t bother worrying about girls first, I&#039;d try getting at least one friend, then maybe two....Once you have friends, you&#039;ll feel a whole lot better and then chances are that girls start paying attention to you. <br /><br />IDk man, start some hobbies, go to a book club, dance / sports courses, anything. Not doing those will reduce your chances of meeting someone to zero. <br /><br />Have faith.

You are not feeling fulfilled with your current situation, yet you have accomplished quite a lot already, a total escape from your normal every day life could be the best thing you can do for yourself. Go to a strange country or somewhere you have wanted to see for some time and live there for a few months, pick up odd jobs and find what makes you happy. Even if its digging ditches, its amazing what a complete 180 can do to change perspective. Life is a journey man and sometimes you really need to shake things up to see how great life can be. Never give up.

I recommend you get help with someone who directly deals with asperger syndrome.<br /><br />People with aspergers are more often than not also suffering from depression. ou are not alone, and there is people who can help.

				Well you&#039;re not going to get much attention from anyone, opposite or same sex, if you stay in bed all day, that&#039;s for sure.<br /><br />What I would do if I were you is buy a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet to India, then get on a plane with a rucksack, as many hundred dollars as you can get your hands on, and the bare essentials to keep clean. From Paharganj in Delhi you can get on a 15-hour bus up into the Himalayas, where you&#039;ll either feel refreshed and invigorated by the beauty of the place, the fresh mountain air, natural hot springs and the friendliness of the people, or not. In which case you can still kill yourself, but at least you&#039;ll have made an effort.<br /><br />Also, October is hash season in the Himalayas.

Backpage.com Get you some women and talk to them for 50 minutes (then get yer rocks off too).<br />Really sleazy titty bars are great for talking to the girls, and pretty soon you&#039;ll make friends.<br /><br />Last idea: Talk to them online try (cleartext) http://www.christianmingle.com for girls who are looking for a decent guy. Then just talk to them till they beg you to meet up.<br /><br />Don&#039;t give up, WTF you only get one shot at death, you get to try a million tries at life!<br /><br /><br />Modzi

				As long as you&#039;re not moonbear, there is hope :)<br /><br />Maybe this won&#039;t be much comfort, but what you&#039;re experiencing isn&#039;t that unusual. Humans need attachment/love or they feel bad. What you&#039;re experiencing, paradoxically, is a survival instinct. <br /><br />Joining a few clubs e.g. gyms, book clubs, sporting assoc, etc will greatly enhance your opportunities to interact with other humans! I know a few people with aspergers who have girlfriends/boyfriends. They have to try harder, but it is certainly more than possible.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re being hard on yourself, there are plenty of people without aspergers who have difficulty forming relationships in their 30s let me assure you! There&#039;s lots of lonely people out there who need hugs! You need to find those people and hug them. There should be &#039;flash mobs&#039; for hugs or something. And taking a small quantity of MDMA is not as dumb an idea as some people think. 80 - 100 mg is enough.<br /><br />You probably know this already, but it&#039;s not a good idea to try too hard in some sense, it scares people if you&#039;re too friendly at first, introductions need to happen slowly over time, there is no algorithm for obtaining a relationship apart from hanging around them and being nice to them, and eventually they become your pals/friends/lovers. Spontaneous friendships and love at first sight events essentially are hollywood inventions. Arranged marriage is more realistic about human nature than hollywood&#039;s bizarre ideas about romance.<br /><br />
