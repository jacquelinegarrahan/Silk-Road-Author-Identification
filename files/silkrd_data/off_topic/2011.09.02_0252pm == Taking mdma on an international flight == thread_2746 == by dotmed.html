				I recall reading somewhere that the TSA legally cannot/does not screen for illicit drugs.&nbsp; If they do a swab test it&#039;s only for explosive materials.&nbsp; Can anyone confirm or deny this?&nbsp; Clearly if they find an ounce of MJ taped to your crotch you&#039;re screwed, but that&#039;s not what I&#039;m talking about here, I&#039;m talking about small amounts of chemicals hidden in plain sight that may, despite all efforts, have trace residue present.<br /><br />Now, regarding customs for a flight leaving the US...&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had a bag searched or seen a dog in the international departure areas of a US airport.&nbsp; Arrivals are another story.&nbsp; Anyone care to comment about taking well concealed personal use amounts of product outside the country?&nbsp; I have no concerns about the arrival country and will not be returning with anything.&nbsp; And no, mailing ahead is not an option.<br />

				who ever said they legally cannot or will not search for drugs is very wrong.&nbsp; lucky for you mdma is small and for the most part shouldn&#039;t be too hard to smuggle.&nbsp; r u taking it in pill form or crystal/powder?&nbsp; if in pill form i would find medicine that is roughly the same size and colour and toss them in.&nbsp; or go to a grocery store where they sell candy that you can mix and match and throw pills in there and put it in your checked baggage.&nbsp; last but not least if your very paranoid do what human smugglers do and eat a balloon of it and shit it out on the other side

				&#039;Normal&#039; passengers wouldn&#039;t think twice about taking a small bottle of ibuprofen in gelcaps on a plane with them. One of those could fit 600mg or so of an odorless white powder which might not lab-test the same as the other capsules...
