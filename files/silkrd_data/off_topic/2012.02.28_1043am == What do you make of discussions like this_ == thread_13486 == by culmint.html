				http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/610216-Has-anyone-come-across-a-psych-that-feels-quot-evil-quot<br /><br />It all seems so intensely irrational to me. Like, I can&#039;t seem to get over the fact that these people aren&#039;t stopping to ask themselves the most basic questions about their assumptions. For example, how on earth is it possible for a drug to contain within it the information to create an experience of something so subjective as &quot;evilness&quot;? I can&#039;t seem to get beyond my anger at the blind irrationality of it all. I feel like there&#039;s nothing I could say to them. Like they&#039;re just too lost in their own irrationalities for me to even possibly connect with them on any kind of realistic level.<br /><br />Why is it that I get so angry at these people? Really I should have pity. Believing false things about reality I&#039;m sure doesn&#039;t do much good for your happiness, and I&#039;m sure that believing such false things as this is a sign that there&#039;s much more than that going on elsewhere in their lives.<br /><br />What do you guys make of all of this (and the general trend of irrational beliefs within the drug user community)?

				That whole thread reads like it&#039;s orchestrated anti-drug propaganda....<br /><br />Ionno, either half of those posts are some whatever anti-drug group posting the old horror stories of &quot;you&#039;ll think you&#039;re dead and see your dead gramps and go insane&quot; or this is just a bunch of emo kids regurgitating shit they heard elsewhere.<br /><br />It&#039;s the interwebz baba, and even clearnet. Rule no 1, what sits behind the screen on the other side is more than likely not what it purports to be....

				Hm, I read that thread a few days ago and didn&#039;t think it was THAT bad. Perhaps I didn&#039;t read it closely enough, but I just see it as bunch of forum nerds complaining about bad trips they&#039;ve experienced.<br /><br />LSD felt &quot;evil&quot; to me once when I accidentally dosed way too much and got kicked in the arse as a result. That being said, I am aware that &quot;evil&quot; as a concept is subjective and problematic. I am further aware that it is irrational to blame the substance itself for my bad trip, as there were clearly other factors involved.

				People are irrational. All of us, you and me included. Rationality is only one part of how our brain works, and if we let our guard down for just an instant, ideas and assumptions coming from other mechanisms will leak through unnoticed.<br /><br />Some people just don&#039;t care that their beliefs are false.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had many bad trips where I was absolutely positive fo the most absurd things. &quot;this is DEFINITELY true&quot;, I&#039;d think, even though it made no sense. When I sobered up, I realized it wasn&#039;t. But a lot of people attribute some magical powers to psychedelics, as if they were an Elixir of Truth that allows us to directly access some sort of Universal Database of Knowledge, and they don&#039;t question the insights they get during the trips. So they&#039;ll believe in every though they have during a good trip, and if they have a bad one, it&#039;s obviously because of evil genies, and not because they were tripping enough to overwhelm their brains. It HAS to be someone else&#039;s fault.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same reason why a lot of people believe in the Devil.

The difference is though is that I almost always realise I&#039;ve been talking crap once I&#039;ve sobered up. I didn&#039;t used to be that way. I used to carry a lot of my &quot;insights&quot; out of my trips, but they often didn&#039;t lead me anywhere good. Maybe the difference is that I&#039;ve experienced fully the negative effects of following through with my false conclusions? Perhaps it&#039;s just a matter of time for these people to come to a similar conclusion? Perhaps not though, it&#039;s clear that believing in some false things can afford you many benefits in our culture (believing in god and the devil for one). So yeah, perhaps these beliefs do do something for them which is sustainable for the time being. Perhaps I was just lucky that mine ended in me in a mess of unhappiness? Speaking from experience, I feel considerably more connected, productive, and happier since shedding many of my more absurd beliefs. Of course I&#039;m sure I still have many remaining, but for now I feel I&#039;m better in line with the reality of things.<br /><br />Apologies for the slight wall of text there! I hate walls of text!
