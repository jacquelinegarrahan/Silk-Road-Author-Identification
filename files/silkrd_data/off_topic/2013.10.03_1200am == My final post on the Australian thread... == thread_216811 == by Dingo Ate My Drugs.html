Fuck fuck fuck!!!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I had any info on there that could lead back to me, but I&#039;m so paranoid that now I&#039;m freaking out.<br /><br />Anyway I have lost thousands of dollars in bitcoins.<br />If your order arrives in the meantime, enjoy it.<br /><br />I hope this is not the end as I have thoroughly enjoyed being here the past 10 months.<br />I hope everybody stays safe and that someday we won&#039;t have to use &quot;illegal&quot; websites to buy drugs. They should all be legal.<br /><br />Take care everyone &amp; stay safe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;ll be fine Dingo.<br /><br />Lets us know if you make the jump over to BMR, etc. Dont use sheep, they have no damn escrow...<br /><br />Me, i&#039;m about to nuke my computer, and start again.<br /><br />There were 2 times i used a name on an order without PGP. Not linked to me, but too close to home.<br />Better be safe than sorry,. so this laptop is getting nuked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I had over 10K. All fucking gone now. Plus I will have to destroy my hard drive/s and some bank cards (don&#039;t worry - not linked to me).<br />That&#039;s all I have. I had been having money issues the last 3-4 months that&#039;s why my listings have only been up occasionally.<br />I only had a limited amount of money to work with. Now ALL of that money was either in escrow or in my account. I was hoarding BTC to make some O/S purchases.<br />All turned to shit. I have never liked BMR because of the murder options that can be bought from there.<br /><br />I&#039;m all for legalisation of drugs because they harm nobody (except potentially yourself). But I am against exploding envelopes, etc.<br />Anyway my email is: dingoatemydrugs@Safe-mail.net<br /><br />Look out for me. I&#039;m not sure if I want to start from square 1 again. I liked Atlantis...<br />After finally getting back up on my feet I have been knocked right down, but this time I don&#039;t know if I want to recover.<br />Fuck this, fuck the Government. Silk Road would have been doing FAR, FAR LESS than 0.1% of global drugs sales anyway.<br />Why don&#039;t they go out and look after real crime.&nbsp; My house got broken into a few years back. The local police didn&#039;t even have time to stay more than 5 minutes.<br />They could not have cared less. They just concentrate on little petty things such as minor speeding offences, drugs, jaywalking, littering, etc.<br />I know that&#039;s irrelevant because the US was the one who shut it down, but I&#039;m sure the 2 countries are much the same.

				About three times the amount that you lost, Dingo. Interestingly my losses were by my FE policy - without that it would have been a lot more. My greatest losses were not in my vendor&#039;s account, it was in my buyers account where I had recently made numerous bulk purchases.<br /><br />It has been great talking to you. I hope life treats you better than we have been treated here.<br /><br />Adios.

Maybe Jack N Hoff was hoarding coins? That seems like&nbsp; massive amount for a vendor that only sells one thing.<br />If JOR were here it&#039;s probably top $500K. He was by far the biggest vendor on here.

				And also i feel your pain the lost coins , i only lost about 3.5k but it still sucks ... <br />I guess i got lazy ,complacent and left them on my account as i planned on making a purchase in the coming weeks ... sounds stupid now that i think about it , as i should of sent all coins to my own bitcoin wallet every chance i got ... oh well live and learn i guess , as all future anonymous marketplaces will , bigger and better things to come .
