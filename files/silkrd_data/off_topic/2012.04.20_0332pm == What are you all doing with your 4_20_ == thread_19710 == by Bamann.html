				I know I&#039;ve got about an oz here that I&#039;m planning on smoking. Buddy of mine promised me a few edibles too, going to reduce myself to a couch-locked puddle of drool.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp; Yourselves?

				For this 4/20 I plan to plunge into the depths of my mind. 12 grams of Psilocybe Galindoi and a monster hit of DMT at the peak. Should be a very enlightening night.

				Not smoking pot, that&#039;s what. My connections didn&#039;t come through. Fuck them. After all the shrooms and shit I got for them for fucking free. Pisses me off. I&#039;m not even pissed off for me, I was gonna get my brother who&#039;s never smoked pot and is a total square high for the first time and now I can&#039;t because no one came through for me.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as many others. None of my orders of Molly have come in. But my girl and me will be celebrating when they do get here. Sadly no money left to score from an IRL connect.

				So I had work all day long. Couple of my clients called in (I&#039;m guessing cause they are most def celebrating 4/20 haha)<br /><br />But sadly I got a very important exam tomorrow morning that is going to determine my summer so I gotta continue studying until bed. SO...I&#039;m just letting this Vyvanse help me focus on my note cards and ripping through study material while I got &quot;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&quot; doc playing in the background.<br /><br />Has anyone seen that documentary? DMT: THE SPIRIT MOLECULE? Never tried DMT but this documentary is pretty damn interesting.<br /><br />Happy 4/20 peeps, be safe and have fun.

				Went to the mail box, looked inside, nothing there :( the mailman even saw me and had a chuckle. It should be here tomorrow, I hope.<br /><br />Time to do some homework - then maybe go to a bar to drink my sorrow away...

				Good call starfishtunacats, you made my 420! Amazing documentary, the visuals made me feel like I was high and super informative. <br /><br />Enter the Void is a cool DMT movie as well, but it&#039;s fiction and kinda dark.
