				I don&#039;t know anyone who has done 25i before aside from myself. Should I give out a sample hit each with some of the shrooms I sell so people can get a feel for it and pass the word around about it?

Normal blotter sized<br /><br />As far as ROA, Ive always told my people to place it between upper lip and gum for as long as possible.&nbsp; I know righteous claims 3-5 minutes is all you need, but whats the harm in leaving it in longer?&nbsp; Also, there is still a very distinct HCl taste around the 30-45 minute mark, leading me to believe that the nbomb is still flowing.&nbsp; 2 hits is my sweet spot
