				I saw someone post something like this on a underground forum<br /><br />&quot;I just bought a pound of the best quality pot out there on the silkroad<br /><br />http://tfaqeav4iwpe3566.onion/&quot;<br /><br />They posted that link ^^^^<br /><br />So is this just another fake?

				Well it certainly isn&#039;t the silkroad address I use (which is http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion; kind of sad I have it memorized, lol).<br /><br />Sure, why not.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fake.&nbsp; They&#039;re phishing.&nbsp; That&#039;s why we have PINs to actually spend or withdraw coins :)&nbsp; Two factor authentication.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I didn&#039;t bother clicking on the random darknet link.

				It&#039;s an obvious scam, but not a phishing site. They make no attempt to collect your SR username and password. If you read the ordering instructions, you email them your order and they send you a bitcoin address with which to steal your money.

				I am more worried about 3 letter organizations trying to copy cat the road in order to bust people then i am about phishing or scam sites. Really tho how hard could it be? I mean you got your pin number for puchases and transfers which could easily be faked as long as one certain key element was invoked. That would be for them to get you switched from the real silk road forums to their fake silk road forums with no glitches or anything that would be a sign to the user that malicious foul play has taken place. A small glitch would probably cause most users to just start a new TOR session. <br /><br />It would most likely be doable on a user who allows scripts in the forums. Once they get you over to their fake silk road forums then they would have to entice you with a particular item up for sale. Something like this would need a whole team to pull it off or maybe just a lot of preparation time to get a fake road and forum ready for a certain person that they been tracking<br /><br />If they have been watching somebodies conversations then they could learn that persons browsing habits and drug buying habits shortly after. It&#039;s un telling how much they may find out about this person if they do it for a year or longer. They start collecting data and began putting together a profile folder. 3 letter organizations have plenty of resources to&nbsp; be able to send you what you order on their fake SR

				I would never click on any other link purporting to be SilkRoad, other than the links posted by DPR with a signed PGP signature. Presently, there&#039;s only one functional link, that&#039;s silkroadvb5piz3r.onion (I remember three other links mentioned by DPR in case of marketplace and forum failure but they&#039;re offline presently). Do not click on links claiming to be SilkRoad, they&#039;re attempts to phish, scam or both, HeeHaw makes a valid point regarding three letter organizations attempting to copy cat, however logically I believe they&#039;re more concerned about the people high up the supply chain than Jo Average and his weekly 5g pot order, still avoid these links at all costs, it&#039;s not worth it. Don&#039;t make a stupid mistake, stick to the one and only official SilkRoad link, and stay safe :)
