				Check the vendors listings for anything liquid related, highly possible he mixed up an order, still had your address and sent it to the wrong person.<br />I&#039;ve even got a letter from customs when I didn&#039;t order anything and random packages would come for me a few times, the vendor I used was too tweaked out to keep their shit organized.

				Sounds like a pretty large amount of liquid... Youre just going to toss it?<br /><br />I mean maybe buy like a mouse from Petco and give it some... If doesn&#039;t kick it I&#039;d try it. Just saying me personally. If it is anything drug related it probably has a fair bit of value&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Be safe tho, use your disgression

You should have kept them so you could eventually do a chemical test on them to figure out what it could be. Like jimmyg said, in the event that it is some kind of drug it could be worth a lot. However, I&#039;m sure the likelihood of someone accidentally mailing you tons of drugs is low.

				whats messed up is the vendor said he did not send it, yet its from the same state as my bud came from, I have no idea what it was, there were no labels or anything, Id hate to dig it out of the dump though.

				next time u want to get revenge on someone, pour some of the liquid in their drink. Watch wat happens to them... Lol i jk dont really do that<br />but seriously you might have something valuable. maybe your address was accidently printed out for a personal shipment he was sending to his friend. <br />I&#039;ve gotten free packs from vendors a month after receiving the first pack.. I guess that means the vendor forgot to erase my address, which is a serious violation but i did get 100 free tabs out of it :)
