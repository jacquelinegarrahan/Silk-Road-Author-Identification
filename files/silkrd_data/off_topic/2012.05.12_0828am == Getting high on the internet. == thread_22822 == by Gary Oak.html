				Does anyone else have trippy websites to share? Personally I just found &quot;http://zoomquilt2.madmindworx.com/zoomquilt2.swf&quot; while on MXE and can safely say it&#039;s quite the mindfuck. It&#039;s a never-ending, self-repeating painting that just goes on and on and on. These clear-net sites are hilarious to visit while tripping considerably hard, especially with music playing in the background.&nbsp; ;D

				Just reading up on it - apparently it took them 2 years to do fully. I wonder if they had to do it animation style and draw every frame and mesh them together or if there&#039;s software that can help you with the zoom.

				Sometimes when coming home from my dealer&#039;s place high, I&#039;ll just surf reddit or even tumblr. There are a lot of simple images and great songs that people put up for my enjoyment.<br />Next time I&#039;ll take a look at that link and see if it&#039;s better. I&#039;ll also keep my eye out for any great trippy sites.

				Ah fuck, this is more of a request for sauce. There were two youtube videos I watched the first time I&#039;ve ever tripped. <br /><br />One&#039;s about a young farm boy who doesn&#039;t realize what he&#039;s worth. So then this computer jacks into his brain and shows him what he could do with life. <br /><br />The other open with an alien about the history of man and the dialogue goes: &quot;but now our brains are covered with soot&quot; and it goes into an intense mix of music and bombs. <br /><br />Me love you long time if you find this&nbsp; :D
