				Brand new to the whole Onion Network so I apologize if this is not the place to be asking this question. <br /><br />I am looking to eventually live off interest earned on money I will have, but do not want the tax office to know about it. Which means I have to use a Bank Account (so I assume anyways) anonymously. So in my mind, I need to get a fake identity to set up bank accounts that can earn interest. Does anyone know of any good DIY documentation, chat boards or something else entirely where I can get the information I need?<br /><br />Obviously, if someone knows of a better way to do what I want (eg: something like the old Swiss Bank Account, which I know is no longer feasible), please let me know. I am far from stupid and very self motivated to find information. I just need a starting point. <br /><br />Not sure if needed, but I am in Australia. So fake ID&#039;s, etc need to be Aussie if that&#039;s the route I need to take. I have worked in the Banking industry here (just as a teller) in the past, so have a bit of an understanding pertaining to what they check. In one of the banks anyway.<br /><br />Thanks for any help in advance.

				This sounds like just what I am after!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />If this is better done in Chat or IM, let me know where and we&#039;ll talk. I am happy to divulge an email address here if you need one (it&#039;s a junk address, so no biggie). <br /><br />As for the &quot;consideration&quot; I am happy to oblige. Within reason, of course.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)&nbsp; I have to warn you, I only have Paypal at the moment. As mentioned, very new here and have not had a chance to sort out or even look into bitcoins. Most definitely will be, but not right away.<br /><br />

				Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Turks &amp; Caicos, plenty of small ex-British colonies can be helpful.<br /><br />My advice would be to split your funds over at least two jurisdictions, don&#039;t keep all your eggs in one basket to help reduce the risk from getting ripped off.<br /><br />Panama has been known to take control of funds from certain individuals.&nbsp; There is always a risk with any financial arrangement and past performance is no indication of future performance, do not rely on a country having been decent in the past to stop them from stealing from you in the future.<br /><br />If your funds come from an illegal venture you are at more risk, most tax efficiency regimes are interested in helping companies and high net worth individuals to legally increase the efficiency of their tax arrangements.
