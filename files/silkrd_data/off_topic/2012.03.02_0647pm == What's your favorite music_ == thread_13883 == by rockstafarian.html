				Hey everyone, I thought this might be an interesting thread to start because what goes better with drugs than music? I understand musical taste is very personal but I think this would be an awesome way to share new music and talk about some of the sounds that soundtrack our lives.<br /><br />Some my favorite artists to listen to when I&#039;m spun are Bonobo, Emancipator, and Nujabes.<br /><br />How about you?

				Music is my main passion and I&#039;m all over the map musically.&nbsp; I love indie rock and 80s/early 90s alternative.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m really in an experimental electronic phase.&nbsp; Especially when I trip.&nbsp; Artists like Windy &amp; Carl, Biosphere, Alva Noto, Taylor Deupree, True Colour Of Blood, Pole, Trentemoller.&nbsp; The new Burial ep is off the charts amazing.&nbsp;

				Forgot to add my own thoughts though.. The album Random Album Title by Deadmau5, I don&#039;t think it gets much better than that. Also like Van Morrison, Avicii, Eminem, and Big Boi. <br /><br />Also, for any of you guys who like REAL fucking hip-hop check out the bands Bliss n Eso and Hilltop Hoods. Two Aussie rap groups, BEST music you will ever hear. Literally makes the crap they play on the radio now sound, well yeah, you get my point. <br /><br />

				Man much love to both of the cats for recognizing and listening to Nujabes, both he and Dilla were taken way to early from us however their music still lives on. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also been an avid vinyl junkie for YEARS now, I have a closet that I converted and put custom shelving in that holds over 8K records and counting. I cannot say that I classify or define myself as having a favorite type of music because I am all over the map. However personal favorites that I always come back to are : <br /><br />Miles Davis, Coltrane, Etta James, BB King, Dr. John, Roy Ayers,&nbsp; Dj Shadow, Dilla, Nujabes, Gangstarr, De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, OutKast, Goodie Mobb, Digable Planets, Pharcyde, Slum Village, Wu Tang Clan, Erykah Badu,&nbsp; a slew of old Houston shit, Screw(grew up during these years), The Congos (if you have never listened to this, go it, arguably the best Reggae album ever), King Sunny Ade....... Man.... Way too much to name. House music!!!! Anything from Traxx records, Moodymann, Defected Records, Theo Parrish...... <br /><br />I also appreciate what the new school of artists are doing in the hip hop and house scene. Asap Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, Freddie Gibbs, Shabazz Palaces (do yourselves a favor and go grab this if you don&#039;t have it, a great drug album) Spaceghostpurp, Kirko Bangz, Curren$y, The Weeknd, Smoke DZA, STS, Big KRIT, Ab-Soul, Mr. Muthafuckin Exquire, Domo Genesis, Stalley, Action Bronson, <br /><br />In house/dubstep/EDM give me Motor City Drum Ensemble (one of the best house dj&#039;s in the world I think), Floating Points, Joy Orbison (fucking amazing), John Roberts, Joker, Dark E Freeker, Magnetic Man, MJ Cole, Pinch, Boddika, Erdbeerschnitzel, Genius of Time, ICube, Iron Curtis, Lawrence, Nebraska, James Blake, RNDM, Space Dimension Controller, Tiger &amp; Woods, Soul Clap, Dj Harvey...... <br /><br />Man. sorry for the massive playlist here but I am high as fuck off an opana listening to music and ran across this thread. Personally outside of sports and drugs there is NOTHING better than music. Just judging by some the artists you cats listed makes me wish I knew some of you- love to have a good conversation about music. We should start up a thread on that in off topic, for sharing and debatable purposes. I hope you guys enjoy my list, and if you don&#039;t know who some of these guys are look them up, I have no doubt in my mind you will enjoy them. <br /><br />/rant. lol.

There&#039;s only so far you can venture into the good part of youtube before you&#039;re going in circles :P<br /><br />Good looks everyone, I&#039;m really digging all these tunes! :D&nbsp; <br /><br />d-.-b Put on your headphones and get lost in your own world.

Funkin is a good one by him and I definitely think you would enjoy it. Uyama Hiroto is another artist you might like and may be familiar with the name as they collabed on Modal Soul. Check out Emancipator as well.&nbsp; Shing023, Dj Tonk, Supersci, CYNE. I also like Shin-Ski and Nomak. <br /><br />Another two that you may like if you are digging this type of music is Dam Funk &amp; Flying Lotus. Are you familiar with these two? Dam Funk is a West Coast artist that is bringing back the whole g-funk, funk and west coast sort of vibe that is really great fucking listening. A bit different then the aforementioned but different in a way that when we first heard Nujabes we were attracted to him. Flying Lotus I think is a fucking genius. <br /><br />You ever listen to Wavves? Check him out too. Also a bit different but I think you&#039;d dig that shit too. <br /><br />Hope this helps you pimpin. Enjoy. Anything else you need holla, I can talk about this shit for DAYS!!!!! LOL.

Radiohead was recently in the area and they were another band I wish I could see live- ticket sold out in 5 minutes and the resell on them was fucking asinine. Got to see Paul Mooney though..

They do a lot of non-profit events, do a lot of charity work in 3rd world countries, and they get the fuck down. I have yet to see a more wholesome, genuine, diverse band.<br /><br />I really dig older stuff too.<br />Pink Floyd (saw Roger Waters do The Wall like two years ago, fucking epic) Led Zeppelin, I still like the Doors but i feel like iv kinda moved on from them a little, James Taylor, Beatles and of course THEGRATEFULDEAD(~);]<br /><br /><br />As few newer stuff<br />I fucking LOVE the Flaming Lips, some EDM, Shpongle is kickass, Tipper is cool, Bassnectar is always fun, Big Gigantic is cool. I&#039;ve been getting into Bluegrass recently but im still so new to that im still learning all the bands. <br /><br /><br /><br />EOTO is (almost) always an awesome live performance.

I totally feel the same way, just for my personal tastes I guess. But I have seen so many people just nearly jizz over the mention of that name... I tried to give it a chance and checked him out, but I just couldnt really dig any of it and was frankly just mainly annoyed unfortunately. I dont see what the hype is?<br /><br />I will admit I am not really into electronic Dj music for the most part. But I do like ratatat and emancipator is one of my favorite artists, I have seen him twice, once on 2c-b and it was a really amazing show. I also saw sphongle and it was a really fun show though I was just smoking. Mostly though I like more indie/alt rock like I mentioned, modest mouse is just my favorite band ever and there really isnt anything else that can compare<br />&nbsp;<br />if you havent heard these arms are snakes you should definitely check out oxeeners!

				For tripping:<br /><br />Dead Can Dance&nbsp; -&nbsp; What I call the epitome of Cosmic music, especially the early albums such as Witnin the Realm of a Dying Sun, The Serpent&#039;s Egg and Spleen and Ideal.<br /><br />Bel Canto&nbsp; -&nbsp; An incredible album of theirs called Shimmering, Warm and Bright is absolutely fantastic, and can imprint itself in one&#039;s psyche in a psychedelic trip in such a way as to permanently, I think, rewire the neural network, for the better, yes.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Claude Debussy - Deep in a mushroom trance, the strange, convoluted impressionistic melodies are incredibly synaesthetic.<br /><br />I have otrhers, but these are my favorite.

				As a psychonautic Dutchman I&#039;ve been into electronic music since I was a teenager... It&#039;s pretty much the leading youthculture since the 90&#039;s... From the subversive &quot;gabber&quot; era in 1993 till the lovely UK bass sound (or post-dubstep era.. Geez that sounds nerdy) today..<br /><br />I mean this stuff is just straight bangin&#039;.. Before listening I suggest a recipe consistin of approx. 10-15 mg MXE nasally..

				Alice in Chains is awesome, my buddy an his dad are really into them and a few other 90&#039;s grunge bands like Pearl Jam an shit<br /><br />Alice in Chains unplugged is fucking amazing, pure and simple.<br /><br />I grew up listening to a little bit of rap, 3-6 mafia, Jedi Mind Tricks, 50 cent, Swisha house, Eminems original stuff.<br /><br />Then i kinda grew outta that, started smoking pot and started getting into classic rock, The Beatles, The Door, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, which then lead me to get into metal, but i never really picked up too much on metal bands, I really dig 80&#039;s metal, Iron Maiden, Sabbath, shit like that, a few modern metal bands i can dig, but its not my thing really.<br /><br />Over the past few years I&#039;ve really started to love EDM, one thing i live is the variety of DJ&#039;s and genres of electronic, Bassnectar is a favorite, Skrillex isn&#039;t bad, i like some of his stuff and although i&#039;ve never seen him live i know a few people who were dissapointed with his live performances, especially at Electric Forest last year. I love Tipper, his shit is awesome, down tempo, bubble sounding noises, I saw him at a rave in October it was great. <br />I&#039;ve been getting into Shpongle since i saw him live. My buddy gave me the new Big Gigantic cd, that is really good too. <br />VibesQuad is good, Krafty Kuts is a favorite too, i saw him at a big rave like two years ago, blew me away, I&#039;m definitely checking out his set at Waka this year.<br /><br />Seeing Bassnectar live is amazing, so much bass in the air, a wild crowd, great times. I&#039;ve seen him quite a few times just in the past year. <br /><br />I&#039;ve also grown to love jam bands too, a bunch of my friends are into String Cheese, i haven&#039;t listened to too much of their stuff yet, I&#039;ve been digging the Grateful Dead too much!! <br />The band Wookiefoot is on par with the Dead in my book.<br /><br />Wookiefoot started a non-profit organization, and they throw amazing charity festivals that are reallyreally fun, the best vibes at a festival i&#039;ve ever felt. Awesome tunes too! They&#039;re really good guys. <br /><br /><br /><br />So i guess these days i just stick with my Floyd, Zeppelin, Dead, Wookiefoot, and jumping around EDM <br /><br /><br />Good to see some great taste in music

				If I&#039;m in a dance kind of mood, definitely Zeds Dead, Knife Party, Monstercat. Lots of dubstep/house/ect.<br /><br />If I&#039;m in a let-my-mind-wander kind of mood, then 9 times out of 10 I&#039;ll be listening to Mogwai. Sometimes Mono, Explosions in the Sky, Bach, ect.<br /><br />Ratatat is usually thrown in somewhere between those moods.<br /><br />Regardless of mood, instrumentals are the way to go. Lyrics tend to get in the way of a great experience.<br /><br />sdesu

I second the FUCK out of Comin Out Hard...... That shit is one of my all time favorites right there. That was back in the day when Pin &amp; Pixel ran shit in hip hop cover art- you remember that shit? I used to buy cd&#039;s just based off how goddamn ridiculous their cover art was. Dr. Octagon, Gza, OB4CL, Jeru The Damaja, fuckin Mobb Deep (who&#039;s classic turned 17 just recently) Nas, AZ, man my list just runs off the fucking page. I&#039;m a straight music junkie. The shit drives my life. <br /><br />And yes, that UNKLE album is unreal. Funny, I was just listening to that the other day. I remember when Shadow&#039;s Endtroducing came out in 96. It was so far out there that it took me a good year to digest that album. Just a masterful display of sampling that I will go no record and state cannot and will not ever be matched again. Even the shit he and Cut Chemist did together, Product Placement and Brain Freeze are still master works. Fucking scratching and mixing with all 45&#039;s- are you kidding me. In Tune and On Time is also immaculate although the actual recorded live performance is so surreal. <br /><br />Thanks for that Chico Mann shit. Never heard of it but you may have turned me onto something new tonight. I&#039;m always up for new music and always up for getting into a discussion about it. <br /><br />Peace.
