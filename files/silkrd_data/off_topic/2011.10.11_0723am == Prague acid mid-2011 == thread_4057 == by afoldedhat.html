				Anyone had acid in prague?? I was in prague, CZ, arround june-july this year (2011) and picked up some blotters of acid from an older guy who used to drop by my hostel regularly to walk the dog (hostel is short walk from Husinecka tram stop). He said they were acid anyway. Plain blotters, tasteless. If anyone has any tips/info on this I would be extremely grateful. I&#039;ve included a description of the type of trip.<br /><br />I took a couple at my friends place in Vienna a few days later, and yes it did have LSD on the blotters, but I&#039;m wondering if it had something else as well, because i was having ridiculously colourful and dynamic CEVs and OEVs significantly more than I&#039;ve ever had before or since with just 2xLSD blotter. These were overwhelmingly powerful CEVs to the extent that some of them have been ingrained into my memory, and some of them felt like real entities existing just on the other side of my eyelids but somehow glowing through. They were flowing visuals but with simultaneous evolving geometric patterns, different to a kaleidoscope. There was a real enhancement of the start-stop style time-fuckery i usually get with LSD (clouds out the window were amazing), as well as full blown hallucinations like people in paintings beckoning to me to climb into the painting (my vienna friend is an artist and her work is hung up around her apartment). I should mention the painting doesn&#039;t actually have people in it so that was cool. Total trip about 12hrs with a plateau of 5 or 6 hours. Body load only for first 2 hours after a 30min come-up, after that nothing but trip. Was absolutely starving afterwards, but apparently lost cooking skils because my friend didn&#039;t like the breakfast i made. I thought it was delicious, so enhanced sense of taste after the trip i guess?<br /><br />In my admittedly few years of partaking of the delicious LSD i&#039;ve never had this kind of trip except on that prague &quot;acid&quot;. Even with 4 or 5 blotters of my regular street supplied blotters. Could there have been some DOx mixed in with it or perhaps something else? Or did I just get some really good acid and just happen to have the best trip ever? (vienna is an excellently awesome place, so that may have had effect on my state of mind).....now I&#039;m rambling so I&#039;ll just say that I need to have this kind of trip again, so anyone that can help me will automatically become my hero.<br />thanks for reading (you actually read all that?!) and tia for any/all help. Need more info just ask :P

				This summer I took 2 Dalai Lama tabs (supposedly 200 mics each), and yeah man my mind was blown by insane visuals. <br />I couldn&#039;t fucking believe my eyes hehe, I could see stuff that didn&#039;t exist, the sky &quot;opening&quot; and the sea coming out of it, animals becoming other animals every second etc.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />It was the cleanest and best trip I ever had to this day, so If u come across these tabs, I strongly recommend them.<br /><br />
