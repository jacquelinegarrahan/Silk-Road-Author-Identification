				Police recently arrested a man on drug charges. The suspect allegedly had been selling pills he claimed would give you eternal youth. When going through their files, police discovered it was the fourth time the man had been charged. His earlier arrests were in 1612, 1800 and 1928.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Reality is a crutch for people who can’t handle drugs.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The price of Prozac doubled last year. When Prozac users were asked what they thought about the increase, they said, ‘Whatever.’<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Why did the man tiptoe into the chemist’s? He didn’t want to wake the sleeping pills.<br />&nbsp;<br />Acid: Better living through chemistry.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Drugs may lead to nowhere, but at least it’s the scenic route.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Drugs: Accomplish your dreams.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I used to have a drug problem, but now I have more money.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Viagra: A whole new concept of recreational drugs.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Three students are sitting in a room smoking cannabis. After a few spliffs they run out. One of the men stands up and says, ‘Look, we’ve got loads more tobacco, I’ll just nip into the kitchen and make one of my speciality joints.’ Off he goes into the kitchen where he takes some cumin, turmeric and a couple of other spices from the spice rack, grinds them up and rolls them into a joint. On his return he hands it to one of his smoking partners, who lights it and takes a long drag. Within seconds he passes out. Ten minutes go by and he’s still out cold, so they decide to take him to the hospital. On arrival he is wheeled into intensive care. The doctor returns to his friends and asks, ‘So what was he doing then? Cannabis?’ ‘Well, sort of,’ replies one of the guys, ‘but we ran out of drugs, so I made a home-made spliff.’ ‘Oh,’ replies the doctor, ‘so what did you put in it?’ ‘Um, a bit of cumin, some turmeric and a couple of other spices.’ The doctor sighs. ‘Well, that explains it.’‘Why, what’s wrong with him?’ demands one of the students. The doctor replies, ‘He’s in a korma.’<br />&nbsp;
