				I&#039;m sure there are some vendors out there with lots of supply and no way to receive orders.&nbsp; What should they do about it?&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking there will be more than one vendor out there who passes the time until SR is back up under the effects of their gear...

				People that really want to place orders with trusted vendors may be doing business with them through the backup email those vendors provided. Tormail being down as well, this doesn&#039;t look like very good option but well, I guess some people are doing that. There&#039;s also those that start going to Atlantis. And maybe some take a vacation for a couple of days.. It&#039;s not like you had to get orders everyday to pay your rent, is it?

				Vending on the SR must add quite a bit of spice to your daily life I would think. So that&#039;s why you do it! What are you selling? I may want to check you out when the site is back up ;)

				Oh I remember your profile, I&#039;d checked it out before.. I was interested in this &quot;noopept&quot;. What&#039;s in it exactly? Is it the name of the molecule? It sounds more like a brand name of something. And are its effects really noticeable? I&#039;ve only tried DMAE as a nootropic and I didn&#039;t really feel a difference so how it this one different?

				Noopept is the chemical name.&nbsp; It&#039;s a drug that&#039;s been around for a while but is just hitting popularity in the US and Europe.&nbsp; It&#039;s branded under many names.&nbsp; I find that it helps with keeping the mental &quot;to do&quot; list in a much more organized state and recalling those tasks easier.&nbsp; There is ongoing research with this drug for the treatment of Alzheimer&#039;s disease with some very positive initial results.&nbsp; I figure if it can help people suffering from dementia improve their cognitive function, it can help pretty much anyone!&nbsp; There are no reported side effects that I have read about or experienced.&nbsp; I won&#039;t say that noopept changed my life, but it has made the day to day functioning much smoother:)
