				fuck it man, cut your loss<br />I know the advice sounds retarded to you now because of the ego blow that both 1) losing love and 2) losing money have both dealt to you<br /><br />but it sounds like you are a relatively intelligent person (based on needing $2,000 worth of ANY chemical)<br />needless to say you could always use a darkweb identity trading community and sell her details, or open a line of credit under her name and sell some goods. But remember, at one point you were in a relationship with this person... and for a reason.<br /><br />I would really just cut my loses and move on. If you spend all the energy you would fucking up or otherwise harming this girl&#039;s ID, then you might end up in a better spot..?

				I have a 20 year old American born ex as well so that&#039;s kinda cool..<br /><br />Fuck what these guys are saying, who gives a shit? Nothing bad will happen to the girl. Worst case for her is she has to spend 30 minutes on the phone explaining that she doesn&#039;t actually subscribe to beastiality quarterly.<br /><br />Unfortunately op you can&#039;t do much with this.... other than sell it<br /><br /><br />

				Come on, don&#039;t you watch/read/see annnnnny crime drama...it&#039;s always the disgruntled ex-lover they look at first when a crime has been committed. Particularly one where there&#039;s $2000 worth of motive.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t worth it...and a little bit dickish.<br /><br />As a girl, I can say if you want to get back at me for being a bitch, go and get rich and start dating Kiera Knightley/Angelina Jolie/Miley Cyrus/someone much hotter than I am!!!! :)

				yeah bin the papers man, birds can and will kick you in the teeth - get over it.<br /><br />aligibbs comment is pretty spot on, but don&#039;t even need to be a celeb - just get a fitter bird and make sure your ex sees you with the new one, that will do her nut more than you fucking over her ID <br /><br />if you do fuck her ID she will get compo and you will get pinched, so she wins again
