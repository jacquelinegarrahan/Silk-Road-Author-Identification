				So oldtoby gets home late from work. It&#039;s been a long week. He rounds the corner to his place and freezes when he sees it. The dodgiest fucking package ever.<br /><br />The thing is freakin&#039; HUGE. Like the biggest grocery store boxes, but solid, or would have been, except it&#039;d been sitting out in the rain. The thing is sagging, coming apart.<br /><br />I&#039;m already mouthing the words &quot;Uh... I wasn&#039;t expecting any package&quot; while my mind races. Two orders inbound from SR. Neither justifies lunchbox-sized parcels nevermind this. And I&#039;m not expecting anything else. Fucking hell.<br /><br />I look around. No one.<br /><br />I whip out my keys, shaking my head, go inside, and close the door, leaving the box outside. I get something to drink. I wait around awhile. I pace. I peer outside again. Still there. No one around. &quot;Fuck me&quot; I say, and open the door, grab the box, and haul it inside.<br /><br />Frowning, I eye the thing sagging wetly on my floor. This has got to be the worst new idea in stealth. I wonder if it&#039;s like one of those jokey presents that&#039;s wrapped in larger and larger packaging. Even if on some level it&#039;s clever, it&#039;s terribly stupid, because by all accounts this should have been re-routed to the post office for pickup, which also means signature. It&#039;s many times the size of my mailbox, won&#039;t fit between my doors. It has no business being here whatsoever. I check the return address but of course it&#039;s nothing I recognize. At about that point I hear the sirens. Maybe you can see where this is going.<br /><br />The sirens pass.<br />I open the box.<br />It&#039;s not from the Road.<br />I completely forgot I had stuff on order from eBay.<br /><br />Thought I would share the laugh. lol&nbsp; So stupid. Still no idea why it was delivered directly to me.&nbsp;

				yer once i got a package from pillpopperz and it was dodge i had to sign for it.. walked out thinking i needed to stop ordering for a bit when shaking the package it sounded like &quot;rattle rattle rattle! pillz pillz pillz!&quot;<br /><br />also got a close friend i known for 20+ years told him once i ordered from sr, now everytime he gets a delivery note he has to sign for he thinks ive gone and used his address as a dropzone which id never do. told him after the second time i quit drugs and refuse to do drugs with him anymore- paranoid security risk. cant even trust yah best mates but i think he was secretly hoping id sent him a gift

				Funny shit&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I had some UGLY non existent stealth from a German vendor this past week, 1g of coke vac sealed and thrown into a bubble mailer that was torn open on delivery. I am AMAZED it made it past customs, worst packaging I&#039;ve seen from any vendor to date.<br /><br />

				Sometimes, no stealth works best.&nbsp; It just looks like a legit product.&nbsp; When you hide it inside something else and it&#039;s x ray then it&#039;s game over.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if its not hidden inside It looks normal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Plant food or something. <br /><br />But ya,&nbsp; a Baggie of white powder falling out of a dodgy envelope is bound to scare the hell out of Americans.&nbsp; Ricin. <br /><br />In today&#039;s online marketplace, vendors should be able to make fake online storefronts to launder the packages with real product deliveries .&nbsp; It&#039;s worth it financially for a vendor to buy a small online eBay type business selling logos on pens or key chains or something simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, a small business or several of them together is the answer to a lot of vendors problems with money and shipping issues.&nbsp; It&#039;s old fashioned laundering.&nbsp; &nbsp;Old Italian pizza shops or bakery with nobody ever inside it, but always open and making a living., but has the shittiest pizza in town ?&nbsp; Everyone sees those around . . .

				lol i have a similiar story yea this one time i ordered 20 pills and i get home and i see this big box and im thinking to myself why does this box look so big it looks like theres a laptop inside. it had terrible packageing, there was tape all around it like everywhere! i pick it up and i feel like 12 bottles rolling around and i hear thousands of pills rattling around in each bottle. I turn around and suspiciously look around and dont see anything so i start to bring it inside. I&#039;m not sure what to do because i didnt order this many pills im scared to open it bec i think maybe its a trap. All of a sudden i hear someone knocking on the front door im looking for a marker so i can quickly write return to sender on the box and i hear my neighbor calling my name &quot;hey i think the mailman left my package of vitamins at your house&quot;<br />I look at the package and its addressed to my next door naeighbor crazy health nut lady. apaarently she saw the mailman leave it at my house and came by to get it. sometimes i think to myself if these crazy taped up rattttling packsages continue to go thru the mail how are they gona bust a professionally mailed stealth pack?

				Awesome story, thank you for the smile! I have definitely done a double take several times when approaching my house and seeing a bulky, awkwardly taped up bubbler mailer half sticking out of my mailbox, only to discover that it&#039;s a present from a family friend. One time there was an Amazon box but some flyers got thrown over top of it and stuck to it somehow. I made a horrified face at that monstrosity and dragged it in as fast as I could only to laugh my ass off at myself when I realized what it was.
