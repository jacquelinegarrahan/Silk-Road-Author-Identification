				&nbsp;:P<br /><br />So I&#039;ve seen numerous posts on the boards about people asking why SR prices are so much higher than the street. I&#039;ve also seen a lot of posts, or replies to posts, with people bitching about how SR pricing is so much higher.<br /><br />Now...I don&#039;t live in California. So I can&#039;t speak to the local price of bud in CA. However, where I&#039;m from...above average bud from a dealer you don&#039;t know well will cost you $20 per gram. Even with a connect, you&#039;re looking at highs for a minimum of $15/gram. I got a buddy who will sell some mids at something like $10 per gram, but &quot;mids&quot; would be a bit of an exaggeration. Now maybe I&#039;m getting ripped off? But I&#039;ve exhausted most local sources and this is basically the norm. Now keep in mind, buying locally means I don&#039;t get anywhere near the strain selection.<br /><br />SR is basically offering solid medical grade bud of all strains...and for small personal quantities, the going rate appears to be about what I&#039;d be paying on the street for &quot;above average&quot; street weed. <br /><br />SR looks like a great deal to me, especially for solid medical grade bud that is delivered right to your front door. Granted, I&#039;m only looking at bud prices.<br /><br />Am I the only one who feels this way?<br /><br />

				I guess that some people don&#039;t understand the functional difference between local and global markets.... I hate how nobody addresses that simple point in said threads. <br />Often the only responses given go as follows: &quot;If ya&#039; dont like it here then fuck you I hope you die&quot;. OR &quot;these are the bestest most awesomest danks with the most awesome customer service in anywhere so they have to charge a premium&quot;.&nbsp; ::)<br />It makes our community sound ignorant I fear.. <br />
