				I have found myself in a situation I am not proud of. I think I should be at least 18 before being an opiate addict and using tons of drugs. But now I want to try and save myself before it&#039;s far too late. <br />I started using lsd and shrooms which gave me a different perspective on my addiction - I decided to order some DMT too and see if that helps. I&#039;m now considering trying Ibogain, but I only have enough money for about 6 grams or 9 capsules of yeshuas powder. Could this help me? This is only like 4 mg/kg ... any thoughts?

				Look into things like Magick. I cant speak for allot of people but some things Allister Crowley wrote taught me to use drugs for a more spirtual purpose. But really it does boil down to will power and self control. Don&#039;t substitute addiction, learn to control it.

No offense, but you&#039;re fucking stupid, and I say that with great care. ;) Work your way though the depression and stay clean for months, maybe even years to allow your brain to heal. Stay healthy, stop drinking soda/eating junk food, drink plenty of water, exercise daily, and get a ton of sunshine is the only other thing I can think of that will help. Other than taking an Ayahuasca journey or Ibogaine. :)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Drinking or using drugs before 15 triples risk of becoming addict or criminal<br />Children who drink or use illegal drugs before the age of 15 are up to three times more likely to become an addict or have a criminal record, British researchers have found.<br /><br />Even children who had shown no signs of problem behaviour while they were young were more likely to go on to become addicted to drink or drugs, contract sexually transmitted diseases, and have a criminal record, if they took drugs or drank on &#039;multiple occasions&#039; in their early teens.<br /><br />The study by a team at King&#039;s College London Institute of Psychiatry will raise concerns about the future of Britain&#039;s children, who are amongst the heaviest drinkers in Europe.<br /><br />There are thought to be more than 800,000 children below the age of 15 who regularly drink and 9,000 children were in treatment programmes for drug abuse in England last year.<br /><br />Over 1,000 three-year-old children were enrolled in this study and numerous follow-up assessments were made over the next 30 years including teachers reporting on behavioural problems such including fighting, bullying and telling lies.<br /><br />Between 13 and 15 years old, they were asked about their frequency of exposure to drugs and alcohol during the past year and their lives were assessed at age 32.<br /><br />The results, published in the journal Psychological Science, found that children who used drugs and alcohol before the age of 15 were two to three times more likely to become dependent on substances, contract sexual infections, drop out of school, have criminal records or an early pregnancy.<br /><br />Lead researcher Candice Odgers said the findings show the effect is not that children with problems use drink and drugs earlier but that &#039;early substance use leads to significant problems in adolescents&#039; future lives&#039;.<br /><br />&quot;Even adolescents with no prior history of behavioural problems or family history of substance abuse problems were at risk for poor health outcomes if they used substances prior to age 15. Universal interventions are required to ensure that all children–not only those entering early adolescence on an at-risk trajectory–receive an adequate dose of prevention.&quot;<br /><br />These findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that early adolescence may be a sensitive time for exposure to alcohol and other drugs, she said.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Also setting goals for where you wanna be in life really helps. Shit sometimes i still think I could be an F1 or Indy driver. But hobbies and interests are nice tools you can turn into talent and possibly a career. But seriously man let this be a lesson learned at a young age.

Granted you can argue it&#039;s subbing one drug for another but pills for weed? Weed&#039;s no real problem to stop, isn&#039;t at all harmful to you, and it&#039;ll get you through the extremely shitty withdrawal period. Of course the alternative (I think you said you were younger than 18?) is to tell your parents and seek help from a physician, but that&#039;s obviously the last thing you&#039;d want to do.<br />

				weed will help but some times you need a break from it all. If depression is driving into drugs then you need to talk to someone. My wife has to take wellbutrin. It helps her a lot. Hiding behind drugs will only make it worse until you are completely gone.<br /><br />Good Luck I hope you can kick it. I know it was hard for me to walk away from hydrocodone.

				The harsh truth is that you need to figure this out on your own. <br /><br />Ibogaine will probably help, but research it properly beforehand. But ultimately, it&#039;s gonna come down to you making a choice, and nothing more/less than that. <br /><br />Do you want to be an addict? Or do you want to overcome the addiction and use your motivation for something more productive?<br /><br />That&#039;s what it comes down to. Your choice. <br /><br />

				If you get depressed from quitting drugs there are a few things you can do in order to reduce that depression while you wait for it to subside. One is to boost your serotonin levels in the following ways; by eating foods like pasta and bagels (they create it), by running EVERY DAY, by learning new things every day and by doing new things every day. Those simple, fun steps will break the depression and help you curb your addiction.

				Hey dude.. that sucks, i delt with that years ago myself, dont do DMT its a short fuck its not introspective to the point that you&#039;ll receive that kind of answer ibogaine might be your best bet or even some shrooms or GOOD lsd.. but ibogaine, tough one.. you&#039;ll need somebody who is experienced and can guide you through and point you in the right direction during it somewhat you could try google a sharman whos local and get some advice, maybe they&#039;ll even give you some advice or atleast bless your trip? .. try not to cross addict in to something else, why not body fuck yourself... get a organic diet happening with a exercise regime but make it really strict! get some of that wheat grass juice happening every morning and some yoga and meditation. Id you dont mind me asking what are you using for? what are you hiding from?

I&#039;m actually an odd case, I&#039;m very athletic and am on the deans list. But theres a curse for every gift your given and addiction is my curse....<br />I&#039;ve taken the first step and haven&#039;t been taking opiates. I feel like shit all the time. I think I&#039;m gonna order some changa and ibogain. I&#039;ll update this when I have my trip. <br />It was really hard ordering ibogain, I could have got a half gram of #4.... or a bunch of weed. But weed doesn&#039;t actually help me it just helpes me hide... Honestly eed makes me depresses after I come down.

				Outoftime20,<br /><br />Self medicating can further your depression and exacerbate anxiety.&nbsp; And it does sound like you are self medicating.&nbsp; Not knowing what you are hiding from, feeling guilty about being unhappy when you think you should - been there.&nbsp; Drugs can be fun and sociable. They can also be a crutch - only that crutch can become a permanent disability.&nbsp; <br /><br />My advice is similar to the kinder posts above.&nbsp; You gotta fill your day with productive, enjoyable activities.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give yourself time to dwell.&nbsp; Boredom, lack of sleep, holding resentments can all lead you back to using.&nbsp; Above all, stop hanging around with using friends (this is easier than you think - tell yourself you are going to have a 2 week trial run, free from all drug influences - tell them you have a drug test coming up).&nbsp; Stop coming to this website.&nbsp; Educate your self about something you are interested in - start a project, even if it&#039;s Legos.&nbsp; Change your habits.&nbsp; This worked for me. <br /><br />Now, this is all great.&nbsp; Everything above is wonderful and easy, right?!?&nbsp; I know it&#039;s not.&nbsp; If it was, we wouldn&#039;t have prisons full of addicts...&nbsp; Given the way you have framed your predicament, I would suggest you come clean with a family doctor.&nbsp; Explain the depression and desire to use to escape.&nbsp; You will make your life a lot easier on yourself if you address the depression.&nbsp; This will require commitment from you.&nbsp; Antidepressants take a while to work - you can&#039;t be impatient and you may have to try several.<br /><br />I bet once you get off the drugs and your internal conflict and guilt abate, your depression will lessen.&nbsp; You may even be able to stop the antidepressants (I did after 2 years).&nbsp; You, and you alone, have to be ready to quit though.&nbsp; No amount of outside support will help until you are ready to receive it.&nbsp; That&#039;s why you were kicked out of rehab.<br /><br />PS&gt;&nbsp; I think you would get more out of a 30 day camping trip to the remote part of the Cascades, Tetons or Rockies than from any psychedelic.&nbsp; I recommend the Cascades - they are my favorite.&nbsp; Oh, and yes, much of this post is hypocritical, but my intentions are good and I have learned from my mistakes.&nbsp; I now respect drugs --- immense respect.

Every minute that you didn&#039;t use is a minute decided by your own cognizance. The only true way to ever leave heroin behind is to truly want it. And I mean TRULY. Not because of others, not because of social constraints, because you know that you are committing slow suicide by using. YOU have to want to stay with the living, YOU have to want to again experience life. None of this god bullshit, none of the &quot;I take a hallucinogen and my problem is solved&quot; bullshit, everything thought and acted upon within the scope of this problem is YOUR CHOICE. Take this bit of info and realize the power within it, it is your power.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Sorry to put it like that, but I have almost three years of opiate/cocaine free living under my belt. During my immediate recovery period I jumped in with both feet. I learned that regardless of all support programs and replacement drugs it was all on me in the end. I watched almost every other member of the recovery group I was in relapse and fail because of two reasons.&nbsp; They either weren&#039;t truly ready and committed to quit, or they put their faith in an outside source rather than themselves. <br />And to clarify, different hallucinogens are good for different things, but no hallucinogen is an &quot;instant cure&quot; . What they may lead to however is to you making some deep down discoveries and solutions within your mind, this may bring you to that special cognitive variable which allows you to finally WANT to quit.<br /><br />Best of Luck, it is still an everyday battle, but one that has gotten easier with each passing day.<br /><br />-Cheers.

				Just try to quit while you are ahead. I used opiates for many years and started at a young age. Only was I really able to stop using them about 2 years ago. This was after close to 10 years of off and on use.. .I just got tired of it. Took a lot of work though.
