				No doubt the internet has brought all us English speaking folk closer than ever before. There is so much cross-cultural slang now in use. What I want to know is, will you Americans ever adopt the word &#039;MATE&#039;?<br /><br />I think we can blame the Aussies for first using &#039;MATE&#039; many, many moons ago. It took a long time before a British person could utter the word without sounding ridiculous, but now we&#039;ve taken it to heart and it&#039;s part of the everyday slang. Almost every English speaking culture uses it, but Americans still stubbornly refuse to. Surely it&#039;s better than &#039;dude&#039;?<br /><br />It late and I&#039;m high, just a passing thought I was wondering about, mateys. :o :D

				I don&#039;t know why but I when I see the words alright mate, I just say them in my head as a either a Scouse or Cockney accent. <br /><br />Where I am from, basically every sentence has to include the word pal or mate. You could be talking your friend, your granny, the prime minister, a random in the street or even your worst enemy but you&#039;ve got to say the word pal or mate, at least once.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed everyone of my mates says the word &#039;like&#039; far too much as a conversation filler, myself included. Was talking to my pal before (a major &#039;like&#039; addict) and in a couple sentences, he said it 18 times, at one point he said it 3 times within 6 words. I&#039;d hate to have to count how much he says it in one day but it can turn any conversation into a game where I can guess how many times he will say it before he stops speaking.<br /><br />Anybody else know of people using certain words a lot, if so then what words?<br />

				I personally could never adopt that term to address a friend, I do so around here because I know there are people from the EU.<br /><br />But deep ingrained in my mind the word mate is my lady whome i&#039;m fucking till she cums on my dick.

				Cunt is a good word, mate. I also subscribe to the idea that the word &quot;mate&quot; connotes an eyebrow raiser not unlike saying the word &quot;partner&quot;, which now has to be said with an ear as to how the listener will take it. I imagine the look on some gangster&#039;s face when he says in a tough-guy voice, &quot;This is my partner, Rosco... from da Bronx.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the night clerk. Will you be sharing the same bed?&quot;<br /><br />On the other hand, I thought being different was what diversity was all about, and the non-usage of the word &#039;mate&#039; is what makes us diverse. I actually believe that since we&#039;ve allowed the elite to define this whole subject, we actually are LESS conscious, more uptight, and LESS able to comfortably acknowledge our differences. If I was to characterize Mexicans as more &#039;hot-blooded&#039; than the Swedes, I am in danger of losing my job, being called racist, etc.<br />

				As an Englishman in the States for several years, I can say many still smirk when I use &quot;mate&quot; but I think the vast majority of Americans are familiar enough with this slang term that even if they don&#039;t like it they just respond in understanding of it... I still use it regularly in conversation.

				i could type &quot;mate&quot; in correspondence with an english speaker who wasn&#039;t from north america and feel okay about it, but to say it aloud in conversation would have to be ironic or it would come across as totally ridiculous.&nbsp; if you are british or aus or whatever, try saying &quot;dude&quot; in conversation with your friends....this is exactly what it sounds like to say &quot;mate&quot; in usa or canada.<br /><br />i feel bad for you all who aren&#039;t from north america because you can&#039;t say &quot;motherfucker.&quot;&nbsp; its such an amazing word but you just can&#039;t pull it off with that accent.
