				Hey guys,<br /><br />I&#039;m sure some have heard of it. For those that haven&#039;t, the magic flight launch box is the smallest portable handheld vaporizer on the market. It a little wooden box with a plexiglass? sliding glass panel that has a heating element inside. It works by sticking in a label peeled rechargeable battery into it which purposely creates a short that heats up the element (and your herbs) to 350? degrees vaporizing the plant material. The price is ~100.<br /><br />Now I haven&#039;t used one yet, but i&#039;ve read many rave reviews on it on in the internet. I just ordered one off of amazon from some guy packing the mflb with a badass airtight waterproof lockable vapecase. For around $120. I&#039;ve wanted this thing for a year now and finally had the funds to buy it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a seller or promoted advertiser, I&#039;m just a user letting people know about this thing!<br /><br />From what people say, it creates little smell and is easily palmed and used anywhere even inside around other people. <br /><br />I&#039;ll come back and update once I get mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				MFLB is a really amazing device.&nbsp; At first it seems overpriced for what it is BUT the thing has a LIFETIME warranty which really speaks well towards the company.&nbsp; &nbsp;That screen is so thin that you really need to be careful cleaning it and I recommend only using the brush they provide.&nbsp; That said if you do happen to rip the screen they will send you a new one after you send them a picture of the MFLB and the serial # on it.&nbsp; You will get your new unit before you even have to send the broken one in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Check out fuckcombustion.com&nbsp; for ANY vaporizer questions.&nbsp; That site is the bible for vape enthusiasts. <br />Only thing is there is a learning curve with the Launch Box....you basically are controlling the temp by the way you are inhaling.&nbsp; So it&#039;s not the best if you are trying to get a few people high.&nbsp; It&#039;s great for super stealth and quick hits.&nbsp; &nbsp;Was using mine in a movie theater last week with no problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;My favorite vape right now is my Arizer SOLO.&nbsp; It&#039;s portable and battery powered and works like a DREAM.....but I still love my MFLB for sure.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />ENJOY

				Had one of these nifty motherfuckers as my first vaporizer.&nbsp; Used to use it during class, between class breaks all the time when I was in high school.&nbsp; If I remembered correctly the batteries burned out after heavy substantial use. (I was pretty much using it 24 hours a day until I got a volcano, carried 12 batteries with me all the time)&nbsp; Now thinking back, those $120 USD could have been invested in a Q-Tower Extreme Vaporizer, and that shits on the Magic launch box anyday... however if you&#039;re one of those people that still live with their parents/ parents dislike cannabis, think it&#039;s the devil&#039;s drug would love the launch box.

				That&#039;s exactly my situation. And yes I&#039;m over 18. I&#039;m planning on using a lot at college in class/in between classes. Now the only thing I&#039;ll have to worry about is people asking me for hits and not using it correctly and combusting material.<br /><br />

				I am so glad you too have bought one! I bought mine at a wonderfully popular smoke shop in the city for $100 and it came with a $40 grinder plus a grab bag of free goodies which is pretty rad! Mine has been used at least every two days since I bought it, it&#039;s so stealthy! Here&#039;s a small number of places I&#039;ve managed to smoke using this thing. . .<br />&nbsp;- The movies<br />&nbsp;- A wedding<br />&nbsp;- In the middle of class<br />&nbsp;- In public bathrooms<br />&nbsp;- At work (which is at an airport behind security)<br />&nbsp;- At my parent&#039;s house<br />&nbsp;- At my girlfriends parent&#039;s house<br />&nbsp;- In my truck parked behind a sheriff.<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s all I can think of right now, although I know I&#039;m forgetting some risky places. But you get the idea! Now this thing doesn&#039;t receive as much use as my bong, but in the right situation this is the perfect device! Eventually, I recommend that you buy more batteries or the power adapter if you use it as much as I do. My favorite thing about it though is the smell of vaporized weed after it&#039;s turned a golden-brown, which smells of buttered popcorn! Yummy!&nbsp; ;D I&#039;ve got about 8 grams of vaporized weed saved up in my ruby pimp-goblet which I&#039;m sure I will be able to cook with once I&#039;ve accumulated enough. Overall, this product get&#039;s a 5/5 for me!&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ve found out that there IS NO ONE PERFECT vaporizer.&nbsp; &nbsp;They all have their specific uses and it depends what you are using it for.&nbsp; I don&#039;t live with my parents Holly but I still love my MFLB.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I&#039;d like to see you use a Q-Tower Extreme in a movie theater.&nbsp; As far as the batteries go.....I invested in a nice battery charger and some more powerful batteries.&nbsp; &nbsp;For a portable vape it&#039;s pretty good....but I still love my SOLO more...but even that has its limitations as far as battery charge goes.&nbsp; Love being able to taste the FLAVOR of these amazing strains available to us stoners nowadays.&nbsp; &nbsp;FYI you can find a MFLB for as low as $90 or so on amazon and other places.

				Thats another thing I didn&#039;t mention. I bought some powerex 2700 batteries (in accordance to recommendations from mflb users) and a smart charger. I&#039;m so excited :D<br /><br />Edit: If anyone has tried shrooms before could you help me out on my thread? <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14145.0

				MFLB served me well for 4 months before I fucking destroyed it. Buy better batteries and buy one of those grinder cards that can grind your herbs very fine.

				i bet they would too. i think they tell you to tear the screen out when you do a warranty claim anyways. So you don&#039;t have to ship the mflb anywhere and you&#039;ll have a nonworking model and they&#039;ll send you a replacement.
