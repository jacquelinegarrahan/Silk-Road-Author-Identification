				I&#039;m sure this thread has been done before but I can&#039;t remember the real name of the game. Basically, I&#039;ll wish for something and the next person to reply grants the wish but with a catch of some sort that (typically) makes the original wish less desirable. <br /><br />Example: Wish(poster1) -- I wish I had a bigger dick<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Granted(poster2) -- granted. You have a bigger dick but now you can never orgasm<br /><br />And then poster 2 makes their wish and so on.<br /><br />Hope ya&#039;ll are down to play because I just railed some ice and want to do shit! ;)<br /><br />Here we go:<br /><br /><br />I wish for a Bugatti Veyron! :D<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh and the more creative the catches the more fun it&#039;ll be so I hope to see some interesting twists!<br /><br />Cheers all,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish
