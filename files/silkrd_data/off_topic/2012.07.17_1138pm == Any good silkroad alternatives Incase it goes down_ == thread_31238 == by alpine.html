				I ve got stuff from BMR and it worked out good stay in escrow and read the reviews and most of all check when was the last time the vendor longed in , There are screamer&#039;s but If you use common sense you&#039;ll be fine guns are usually scams check the forum to see if there is some thing about the vendor u planing on buying from and make a informed decision.<br /><br />It is smaller but some stuff is cheaper and after all if you dont try something else you going to limit your self to only one source if SR goes down I sincerely hope it wont but then you never know.<br /><br />regards&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				If silkroad goes down, which I don&#039;t think will happen anytime soon, there&#039;s still this forum.<br /><br />The community will find an alternative when it has to, and the best alternatives will be mentioned on the forums.<br />Or maybe it will be like the kino.to case, where two weeks after LE had taken the site down an exact copy of it appeared with the url kinox.to<br /><br />All we need is a secure cms with silkroad functions, a server and some trustworthy people willing to risk their lives for a shitload of money by hosting a SR clone. I&#039;m sure there are enough people out there with these qualifications.

				Yeah....The Hidden Wiki has been attacked and taken down on Tor several times, and anonymous have hit kiddie porn sites too.<br /><br />SR is just as vulnerable I should imagine!!<br /><br />I feel that DPR must have some kind of a backup server in case of the unthinkable (inevitable?) happening, but the template has been set and this site has set a benchmark and blueprint of how this shit should go down!! I have no doubts that other sites would appear but while there is Silk Road, why would you want to go to any other site?? BMR is too dodgy for me as it is now.....You click on a vendors page but they ain&#039;t been active for 5 months n shit, and it is basically like SR but just not as good functionality wise with fewer choices and less activity on that site. I actually found BMR before I found SR and was going to put in an order but then we came across SR....It was like HOLY FUCK!! This is the one!!!!! Never looked anywhere else since.<br /><br />SR 4 LIFE!!! I don&#039;t even wanna think about goin back to the comparatively limited options I have locally!! That shit just ain&#039;t gonna fly any more!! lol<br />

Although it may be easy to thwart a DDOS attack on the clear-net through mitigation, it&#039;s not so easy to do so within the onion system as there are no direct IP addresses to block.

This would slow down the nodes that are within the circuit thus degrading the overall performance of the system. It will not crash the entire system but for some (depending on the amount and location of circuits) grind it to a crawl. Maybe enough to make every page time out, and make the denial of service more successful than just using one entry point.

				i&#039;ve only ever had smooth transactions on BMR. there are some obvious scammers, but they don&#039;t do any real business. BMR does recommend not to FE, and if you follow that advice, you won&#039;t have any problems. there may be less vendors and products than on SR, but prices are good, transactions are transparent and there definitely aren&#039;t more scammers than on SR or any place else for that matter (apart from the obvious hitman and kiddy scammers who require FE and have 1 feedback they wrote themselves).<br /><br />here&#039;s the official link: http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br />here&#039;s also the forum link: http://fec33nz6mhzd54zj.onion/<br /><br />btw, one of these huge scams that hit SR lately never happened on BMR and it wouldn&#039;t be likely to happen even if there were more users. BMR simply expects you to use your own head, and if you follow common sense and advice given, you shouldn&#039;t have a problem. the only problems that arise are from people heading over from SR and finalize early, as they are used to.

				DDOS = distributed denial of service = a lot of different computers sending a lot of requests to a server. a modern server can&#039;t be knocked by it? even the amazon cloud had troubles with DDOS last year or so. mastercard and visa servers were DDOSed too. there are strategies against it, but most modern servers are vulnerable to that. and you might as well be DDOSed through TOR.
