				Have you ever been cheated on by a girlfriend/boyfriend? Ever cheated on you&#039;re girlfriend/boyfriend? I&#039;ve been cheated on a couple times, when you&#039;re girlfriend/boyfriend has been cheating on you, especially if they have been doing on regularly behind you&#039;re back, it&#039;s one of the worst feelings in the world when you find out about it.<br /><br />One of the worst ones for me was my sons mom a couple years ago, I read a email she sent to her friend talking about it, she was fucking the guy who lived a couple doors down from us. I was crushed, I hadn&#039;t suspected anything was going on, she swore she would never stray again and we tried to work it out for my son. Only problem is she&#039;s bipolar and totally fucking crazy in the head. (why is it the totally crazy bitches are always the most fertile?! lol) So a couple months later found out she was cheating again, and then I started cheating because she was and our relationship was terrible by then. So needless to say when we broke up it was no big deal because we hated each other and didn&#039;t care.<br /><br />I cheated on a girlfriend once because we had been going out for a couple months but she said she wasn&#039;t ready for sex yet. I only did it once, I was drunk and I regretted so much the next day. Felt so guilty about it, but I never ended up telling her. We broke up a couple months later anyway though<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I found out that my ex was cheating basically the whole time we were together, with as many as 3 different guys. I found out months after I broke up with her and already hated the bitch by then anyway, so I wasn&#039;t really phased by it. Interestingly enough she was bipolar too. <br /><br />Makes me glad that I didn&#039;t take her up on her offer to remain fuckbuddies, she&#039;s probably got monkey aids by now.

The one who tried to stab me had borderline personality disorder too, and both of the girls i dated with bipolar were not getting treatment. But you are right, some people are fine with bipolar, just seems like the craziest girls always end up being bipolar or have borderline personality disorder (the worst one probably).&nbsp; I&#039;m just speaking from personal experience :) And I also tend to be attracted to crazy girls for some reason lol<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=102080.msg710921#msg710921">Quote from: Roky Erickson on January 08, 2013, 06:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pretty sure all women are bipolar guys, some less than others.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL<br /><br /><br />

				Jesus. I actually had a somewhat similar thing happen to me, I don&#039;t know what it is with crazy bitches and pretending to be pregnant. What do they expect to gain from it? <br /><br />Also what is 4mg LSD like? The most I&#039;ve done is 500ug and even on that I find the body high to be so intense during the comeup that it&#039;s almost uncomfortable. Would love to try a ridiculous dose like that one day but unfortunately LSD is expensive as dick and impossible to find

				I think it&#039;s worth noting that the LD50 is estimated as 12mg.&nbsp; That means he took a third of a dose that&#039;s expected to kill 50% of those who ingest it, just FYI.

				When I was younger I used to think I would never cheat on someone, its so bad blah blah. <br />Then I went out with a cheating whore for a few years and she changed my perception after cheating on me a number of times. <br />I used to think &#039;have to get them before they get you&#039;. Over the last few years though I have relised&nbsp; not everyone is a cheating whore. <br />And yeah like you said its the worst feeling... especially when you are young and in first relationship and believe said cheating whore when they say it will never happen again... I suppose its all part of the learning experience. <br /><br />and oh my god don&#039;t get me started on the crazies. I have so many stories from this one other girl. She was a REAL stalker, all though never cheated on me which was nice :-) <br /><br />These 2 stories are 1000% real. - She tells me one day she is pregnant with my kid... that was before we did anything which could of got her pregnant...................<br /><br />another time when I wanted to break up with her she said she would kill herself (she had said it 100 times before) so i finally give in and i&#039;m like ok well.. off you go then... an hour passes... she texts me back saying she has NOW killed her self...

				Where the fuck are you guys finding these lunatics?? I&#039;m gonna go out on a limb here and say maybe these crazy chicks are drawn to druggies? Although. I imagine my man might call me bipolar if I ever run out of pot.<br /><br />Back to topic. I have been on every side of this equation (cheater, cheatee, other women). The first time I got cheated on was by a bf in high school. That especially sucked since he took my vCard like a month prior. Douche.

				Maybe these crazy chicks gravitate towards drugs and druggies or maybe drug users gravitate towards mental illness.<br />Incidentally i have a mate who is bipolar and the only thing that works for him when he feels bipolary is a load of crack. Never uses it otherwise.<br />Throws up when he does it but it seems to calm the fucker down.

				Me and a few friends rented a house together.<br /><br />One of my friends had a girlfriend and they got along really great. For a while. Then she decided that she liked me.<br /><br />She thought she broke it off with my buddy / roommate. He hadn&#039;t really gotten the clue.<br /><br />Everyone knew we were fucking but it never really seemed like the right time to talk to him and say &quot;Hey, you know this is going on right?&quot;<br /><br />One night he was working late so she came over. We were in stealth mode. Didn&#039;t want to be all in his face. So she parked her car down the road and I picked her up. We fucked. Like mad. Then I went to drive her home right before he was going to get back.<br /><br />We hopped in my old Dodge, drove down the only road off the street and into the main intersection. Made a left hand turn and the car stalled.<br /><br />Right in the middle of the road. <br /><br />It was the carburetor. It always was the carb going around turns.<br /><br />It was all right, I had a can of carb starter, basically just a spary can of gas the primes the carb and gets it firing again.<br /><br />I sprayed some on the carb like I had done countless times before.<br /><br />I was in a bit of a hurry.<br /><br />I sprayed a bit too much.<br /><br />My entire engine lit up in flames.<br /><br />Our effort at being sneaky had failed somewhat. We eventually got the fire out before my buddy caught us.<br /><br />A few weeks later she was over. We were having some LOUD sex. Everyone was home but I was young and rude. When we were done we emerged from my room sweaty and her in my t-shirt. My buddy pulled her aside, took her into his room saying we need to talk, and then asked her, sweat dripping down her face onto my shirt:<br /><br />&quot;Are you seeing someone else?&quot;<br /><br />

I think I was functionally incapable of selfless love until I went through all the stuff I have in my life so far.

I needed to get a few broken hearts and to suffer a little to get to be the person I wanted to become.

				So I&#039;m not particularly proud of this, but I&#039;ve been the third part of the cheater/cheatee relationship... accessory.<br /><br />and it ROCKED. You know how good it felt to have a girl cheat for you? And leave him for you? I knew it was &#039;wrong&#039;, but I was too damn proud of myself. He wasn&#039;t right for her, is what I told myself, (and what she told me), and there was a lot of validity to that - didn&#039;t change the fact that I knew she had a bf and went through with the fun stuff. <br /><br />Of course, not too long after, I went out the same way he did. And it hurt, a lot, but the whole process still thrilled me.<br /><br />Now, to be clear on cheating: She only emotionally cheated on him; (things got physical after they broke up) (the day after) (she claimed she had some scruples) (when I went out, it was by her hooking up with the new guy. In front of me.)<br /><br />EDIT: Below this line is some wet-blanket stuff. But I really felt like I needed to say it. Anyway, everyone in this thread already knows it, I just knee-jerked because I realized some of it for myself.<br /><br />My first reaction is to post my story here, but fellas, lets keep some smarts about us.<br /><br />These are forums for a highly illegal black market. We KNOW these pages are scraped and everything ever posted on them exists in multiple LE and other agency databases. Stories like these, from a member&#039;s hundreds of posts, could very easily begin to narrow down a personality profile. Even your writing style will eventually begin to show itself to the extend that analysis software can begin sifting and coming up with matches.<br /><br />Have a fun social time, describe your events and experiences - but these kinds of stories, that may have details far more specific than a trip report or other discussions, seem like a really bad idea.<br /><br />Not to rain on your parade. Just remember where you are. Maybe make a second account so you can take part in the personal stories - an account that won&#039;t have ANYTHING illegal on it - no trip reports, no talking about packages you received from what vendor, etc.

If you really think their is a division of the CIA working on documenting my sexual forays and correlating them with reported drug use in hopes of busting down my door to find at best personal use amounts of substances in my house please consider the tin-foil hat option mentioned above.<br /><br />There&#039;s nothing illegal about being on a forum. There&#039;s nothing illegal about having had taken drugs. Clinton didn&#039;t get arrested for the pot he smoked did he? And he told the whole world about that. It&#039;s illegal to buy, sell and possess drugs. I have no intention of writing anything that will help the police get a hold of me while I am doing any of those things, other than that I love the fact that they have to sift through my bull shit as they peruse the forums looking for real information.<br /><br />I know you were just giving a kind warning so sorry for the tongue in cheek response but I think you get where I&#039;m coming from.

Maybe make a second account so you can take part in the personal stories - an account that won&#039;t have ANYTHING illegal on it - no trip reports, no talking about packages you received from what vendor, etc.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />On a related note, I am opening a vendor account to sell tin-foil hats in case anyone feels they might need them...<br /><br />I could write a book called - ALL THE DRUGS I TOOK - publish it under my name with a big picture of me on the cover and photographs of me ingesting the different substances and face ZERO prison time. If you really think <br />There&#039;s nothing illegal about being on a forum. There&#039;s nothing illegal about having had taken drugs. Clinton didn&#039;t get arrested for the pot he smoked did he? And he told the whole world about that. It&#039;s illegal to buy, sell and possess drugs. I have no intention of writing anything that will help the police get a hold of me while I am doing any of those things, other than that I love the fact that they have to sift through my bull shit as they peruse the forums looking for real information.<br /><br />I know you were just giving a kind warning so sorry for the tongue in cheek response but I think you get where I&#039;m coming from.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />LOL<br />My favorite part :<br /><br />&quot;their is a division of the CIA working on documenting my sexual forays and correlating them with reported drug use in hopes of busting down my door&quot;<br /><br />

				Both...<br /><br />But I usually have been the cheater unfortunately.&nbsp; Most people think guys cheat more, but actually women are more likely to cheat in a long term relationship or marriage.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a pretty terrible secret to have to carry.&nbsp; It&#039;s like torture.

				i cheated on my first gf with a guy we were only 16 it genuinely didn&#039;t mean anything. i told her it was just a kiss but it was more. she then revenge cheated on me with her ex bf. i didn&#039;t really give a shit. i think shes gone back to men for good now. she crazy. not for liking men, shes actually crazy. borderline i think.<br />i managed a rather long term non cheating relationship since. this was after quitting alcohol. i wouldn&#039;t be able to have a secret affair or anything i have an annoying tendency to be honest.

				I&#039;ve always wondered why they say you catch an STD...<br /><br />I mean, it&#039;s not like a leprechaun or a lucky break, it&#039;s a disease. I wasn&#039;t looking to catch anything.

				LMFAO....<br /><br />This forum is full of Man whores and sluts....<br /><br />I say this just getting back from a one night stand, the guy was trying to get my number but I just was like &quot;thanks so much for paying my tab (it was at least 60 bucks, I drank a shit load and a bunch of redbulls) last night,&nbsp; and not letting me drive (I was pretty much falling over I drank so much.)&nbsp; I come here a lot, so maybe I will see you around&quot;.<br /><br />Yeah, I guess I&#039;m a slut, whatever.&nbsp; He was actually rather gentle and loving, which is rare in a drunken one night stand.&nbsp; <br /><br />And yes, Condoms and BC pills were used, so I don&#039;t think I need to worry about chlamydia or getting pregnant lol.<br /><br />Why is it that guys get congratulated for this, but girls are looked down on?&nbsp; I sometimes make a challenge to target a certain guy at a bar, get him to come over and start talking to me using subtle cues and see if I get him pay my tab and get laid.&nbsp; No phone numbers exchanged....kinda like a female Barney Stinson, but I&#039;m&nbsp; not a total ass about it.....at least imo.

				I&#039;ve been the cheater and the cheated. They both suck. One is lots of guilt and the other is an ego-crusher and in general a shitty thing to experience, especially if you really cared for the other person.<br /><br />I will never cheat again, nor will I allow myself to be cheated on. <br /><br />If you&#039;re getting into a relationship - make the intentions clear. Let the other know exactly what you&#039;re hoping to get out of this. I&#039;ve found people are happy to just spend time with you and enjoy your company and be able to fuck than to have to get into a serious relationship to be able to do that.<br /><br />TL;DR: It&#039;s not worth it.

				As far as I know, I&#039;ve never been cheated on. <br /><br />I made out with a (different) girl while I had a long-term girlfriend once. Not sure if that counts as cheating or not. <br />Our relationship had gone sour, I don&#039;t regret it. Though we strangely enough did stay together for another 9 months after I told her.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to go on a bit of a rant here. I want people to understand that I am going to make some pretty large generalizations. Obviously there are examples where the following is simply not true. It&#039;s going to be focused on an overall trend, not specific cases.<br /><br />In my experience with my generation, women cheat more than men. I know far more women that have cheated on their significant others than men. Some heartlessly and repeatedly. Now that&#039;s not really what statistics show, but most published statistics on infidelity focus on married couples. I&#039;m fairly young, in my early 20&#039;s. Most of my generation is not married, and are too young to be included in those statistics, so I don&#039;t feel they apply. Like I said, I feel as though, in my generation, more women cheat than men.<br /><br />It&#039;s due to the way my generation was raised, I believe. I&#039;ll explain. <br /><br />First off, I believe that women are less affected than men when their partner cheats. Not that women aren&#039;t strongly affected, because they most certainly are. Just, as a whole, slightly LESS affected. Before the feminists start ranting, let me explain.<br /><br />Take two identical couples. In one couple, the man cheats. In the other couple, the woman cheats. When one partner finds out the other cheated, both sexes will be equally devastated. At first. However, the woman, in my experience, recovers much more quickly than the man. Why? Not sure, that&#039;s a question for a psychiatrist. But that&#039;s been my experience. Men have a harder time recovering from relationship devastation in general, especially infidelity. Ask a marriage counselor sometime. When a man cheats in a relationship, the relationship is recoverable far more frequently. When the woman cheats? It usually signs a death knell for their marriage. Men just can&#039;t recover from being cheated on as well as women. <br /><br />Now, even if you don&#039;t agree with what I just said, imagine that it is true while I explain further. That men recover slower, and have a harder time with recovery than women when cheated on. <br /><br />My generation has been raised to have much more empathy than previous generations. There&#039;s no arguing with that. We are taught to value kindness and compassion much more than previous generations. (&quot;Everyone&#039;s a winner! Here&#039;s your participation ribbon!&quot;)<br /><br />Now, what is empathy? The simple explanation is that empathy is treating someone how you would like to be treated. But it&#039;s more complicated than that. Basically, when deciding how to treat someone, our generation has been raised to first consider &quot;How would I feel if someone did this to me?&quot; The result of this societal teaching is as follows: If you, personally, don&#039;t like it when others do something to you, you&#039;re unlikely to do it to them. For example, if you are extremely affected when someone comments on your choice in clothing, you&#039;re unlikely to comment on other people&#039;s choice in clothing. If you&#039;re extremely affected when someone laughs at you, you&#039;re unlikely to laugh at other people. If you&#039;re extremely affected when your partner ignores your text messages, you&#039;re unlikely to ignore theirs.<br /><br />If you feel you&#039;d be extremely affected when a partner cheats on you, you&#039;re unlikely to cheat on them. <br /><br />Now, assume again that women are generally less affected by men&#039;s infidelity, and men are more affected. If we saw an increase in empathy within a generation, we&#039;d see rates of male infidelity decrease, and rates of female infidelity increase.<br /><br />And in my generation, that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m seeing. Women typically feel as though cheating is more recoverable, and males feel as though cheating causes utter devastation. So, women are becoming more likely to cheat, and men are becoming less likely to cheat. <br /><br />Either way, shit sucks.

				I know a bloke who was in an awesome relationship for almost a decade. They did everything together, trusted each other totally. Partied hard, did heaps of drugs, had an awesome bunch of friends and the sex was reportedly amazing&nbsp; etc....

She was house proud and an amazing cook and they looked after each other like no couple I&#039;ve ever seen. They laughed together all the time, had awesome holidays and as they both worked hard, there was never any money troubles.<br />Then one day a girl appeared in their life, a mutual friend who&nbsp; shared a passion for several of this blokes interests. She seemed a lot more intelligent than the current girlfriend and many a night was spent in deep conversation while the girlfriend slept so she could get up and work the morning shift.<br />This bloke became totally smitten with this other woman and started to see all sorts of things wrong with his current partner and so a torrid and intoxicating affair was born.<br />More and more reasons were found to dislike his current partner and soon she was unceremoniously dumped. She cried and begged for another chance but the cheater was steeled by his lust for the other woman and wouldn&#039;t even enter into any serious conversation about mediation. Her cries for forgiveness and a second chance haunt him to this day. He can still see the pain and heartbreak in her face as if it happened yesterday.<br />A couple of weeks go by and the &quot;perfect girl&quot; he ran off with became a raging psychopathic bitch....&nbsp; Riddled with jealousy, issues and hate from past life and a willingness to fight to the death even when she was wrong and do and say the most terrible things. An ego that was so defensive, that the slightest sledge in jest could cause a vitriolic tirade that would make any human cower.&nbsp; Messy, lazy and able to justify any misdeed to herself and everyone around her.<br />So the bloke ran for the hills and tried so hard to get his trusty long term love back,,,,, She seemed open to the idea and spent many days with her old beau and he thought maybe, just maybe, he had a chance of reversing the greatest mistake of his life.

Here&#039;s the situation: I&#039;ve cheated on her at least seven times, and confessed only one, where it only involved oral sex. She was extremely upset, crying night and day for a week, and&nbsp; every now and then since. To this day she still hasn&#039;t forgiven me, even though she is still with me. When we talk about it, she still very emotional about it. <br /><br />The other reason why I&#039;m not telling her is obviously because I&#039;m afraid of losing&nbsp; her, and I know that if I confess it all, she will leave me, which I understand and would probably do the same. Even if I explained that it was just pure sex without any feelings involved, she would keep her pride and go away. Far away. <br /><br />And I felt many times like telling her, I couldn&#039;t stand it anymore, all those sleepless nights lying down next to her, all those guilt-consumed speechless moments, etc...In this case, I also believe that telling her would be just the easy way for me to get rid of my guilt, but it would hurt her very deeply and perhaps handicap her future relationships and her attitude towards men. Sure you&#039;ll tell me her scars will heal over time, but how long ? I&#039;ve been hurt 10 years ago, by some friends, and I&#039;m still struggling to get over it now, and I won&#039;t be able to forget anytime soon. <br /><br />And really, sometimes I&#039;d rather not know because getting deeply hurt have consequences on your life. <br /><br />We&#039;re planning to take MDMA for her birthday soon, I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s gonna happen...I&#039;ve considered what may happen if I told her, but MDMA lasts only 3 hours, and then you wake up in the morning tired and depressed, thus facilitating more hurt and more sadness. <br /><br />I&#039;ve weighed the pros and cons here, and I think not telling will be more beneficial for both of us in the long run. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				First of all DON&#039;T tell her on her birthday. If you do mdma then you might tell her, no? beeeee careful. She&#039;ll hate her birthday if she stays with you bc it&#039;ll remind her every year. Alternatively, she&#039;ll hate her birthday bc that&#039;s the day you two broke up. <br /><br />Anyway, quite the dilemma you&#039;ve got here. You cheated a whole bunch of times. naughtyyyyyy. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d tell her if I were you. You &#039;ve been really bad. And she got really upset over what I&#039;m assuming was a blowjob so you&#039;re right about likely getting dumped over this. <br /><br />So now my advice is: if you don&#039;t want to get dumped don&#039;t tell her.

				Totally agree with TB on the birthday reveal thing. Girls tend to hold onto that stuff, they like anniversaries and shit I guess. <br /><br />Honestly though the whole point of a relationship, the whole point, is to be with someone that accepts you for who you actually are. Getting fucked by a hottie is easy enough but getting that hottie to wash the sheets with a smile after you had a wet fart the night before... that&#039;s what a relationship is. It&#039;s happily dealing with other people&#039;s shit because they deal with yours.<br /><br />I get it, there&#039;s history and stuff. Connections. You want it to work out because you told yourself and her it would work out but that was all based on this illusion of who you pretend to be. The relationship is based on the idea that you are faithful and you my friend like to fuck other girls. Personally I&#039;d lay it out for her at some point and just claim to have that sex addiction thing going on. If you can get it all in the open and keep her from being all sad about it you win and if she can&#039;t deal with the truth you&#039;re not in a relationship you&#039;re in a sinking ship. Girls look all pretty and soft but I have never met a one of them that wasn&#039;t able to figure out when a man was about town. Sometimes they fake it and she might well be doing that. Sometimes it takes a while. But it always happens.<br /><br />Anyway, just an old man chiming in. Been there and done that. So much happier now that I am in an honest relationship... or two.

Ever cheated on you&#039;re girlfriend/boyfriend? I&#039;ve been cheated on a couple times, when you&#039;re girlfriend/boyfriend has been cheating on you, especially if they have been doing on regularly behind you&#039;re back, it&#039;s one of the worst feelings in the world when you find out about it.<br /><br />One of the worst ones for me was my sons mom a couple years ago, I read a email she sent to her friend talking about it, she was fucking the guy who lived a couple doors down from us. I was crushed, I hadn&#039;t suspected anything was going on, she swore she would never stray again and we tried to work it out for my son. Only problem is she&#039;s bipolar and totally fucking crazy in the head. (why is it the totally crazy bitches are always the most fertile?! lol) So a couple months later found out she was cheating again, and then I started cheating because she was and our relationship was terrible by then. So needless to say when we broke up it was no big deal because we hated each other and didn&#039;t care.<br /><br />I cheated on a girlfriend once because we had been going out for a couple months but she said she wasn&#039;t ready for sex yet. I only did it once, I was drunk and I regretted so much the next day. Felt so guilty about it, but I never ended up telling her. We broke up a couple months later anyway though<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I personally think is inhumane to expect anyone to be faithful for the duration of an entire lifetime. I think you can love someone but want to be with other people occasionally who you also have a connection with and care about. Its impossible for one partner to meet all your needs. If you read into the history of marriage it was normal to have lovers on the side in the past until people started marrying for love and women working and then divorce rose to 50%. The fact that 50% of people get divorced tells you that a large part of the population isn&#039;t wired to be with just one person and one person only for an entire lifetime. In my head jealousy is the reason why people can&#039;t share and have an open relationship. One day I hope we have evolved so much that the survival value of the emotion of jealousy will dissipate to the point that open relationships will be the norm but we are not there yet and dont know how long it will take to get there.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				i&#039;ve been cheated on definetley twice, and possibly a third time, all with 3 different guys.<br /><br />First one broke my heart, second I couldn&#039;t care less because I hated the guy, and third time, well it was evident from when we met he was more of an open relationship type of guy.

				Only been cheated on once, timing couldn&#039;t have been worse, I was 18, I had a ton of money at the time, my girlfriend looked like a frickin&#039; model, I thought she was perfect for me, so naturally I was spending lots of money buying her gifts and taking her on vacations and shit. <br />One day we were hanging out at my house, in the evening she told me she has to go because some relatives were visiting. I go to sleep, at about 3 a.m. phone&#039;s ringing. My buddy, drunk as shit, music playing in the backround &quot;dude you gotta come here your gf&#039;s cheating on you&quot;. I tell him &quot;you&#039;re drunk, go fuck yourself and hang up&quot;. 2 mins later he calls me again, he was outside this time and told me he was serious. I get up asap, jumped in my car, went to the party, I find the guy, still not believing him, I follow him to the room, open the door and, sure enough some guy was all over her. <br />Long story short, my world came crushing down, I was constantly drunk for the next couple of months. My grades went to shit, I lost all my money playing casino games and was about to kill myself before I realized she wasn&#039;t worth shit. I&#039;ve fully recovered, but I still want to beat the shit out of her when I see her for wasting a year of my life.

				I think it&#039;s easier to deal with people cheating when you appreciate that we are all just animals dressed up like people pretending to be sophisticated and more often than not failing completely. If you tossed a bunch of kids out in the wild and let them grow up to adulthood there&#039;s not a chance in hell that they would decided that monogamy was the natural order of things. The girls would latch onto the biggest strongest man that could ensure them a steady supply of food and that would be that. I got into a fight with a girlfriend one time over freedom of choice and closed the argument with this:<br /><br />Can you choose to breath?<br /><br />She nodded yes.<br /><br />Can you choose not to breath to the point of death?<br /><br />She shook her head no.<br /><br />So is breathing really a choice?<br /><br />Our brains rationalize instinctive behaviors and that provides the illusion of choice in our life. We think because we choose what to eat we are making a decision to eat and yet if we starve ourselves long enough the animal will always take over and dig through trash bins if needed to get us the calories we require. Sex is an essential part of any animals survival, at least as much so as food and air because without procreation nothing else really matters and so our ability to influence choice is painfully limited. We will almost always try to latch onto the best possible mate we can find and out only decision is how our brains decide to articulate the thoughts that justify this instinct.

We crave the best possible mate for ourselves and will create any string of thought needed to justify our actions. It&#039;s the height of arrogance to assume that we have evolved into something better than an animal when the proof is all around us that we fight, bicker, lie, cheat and steal to get the same advantages and benefits our &quot;less evolved&quot; ancestors did.

If you tossed a bunch of kids out in the wild and let them grow up to adulthood there&#039;s not a chance in hell that they would decided that monogamy was the natural order of things. The girls would latch onto the biggest strongest man that could ensure them a steady supply of food and that would be that. I got into a fight with a girlfriend one time over freedom of choice and closed the argument with this:<br /><br />Can you choose to breath?<br /><br />She nodded yes.<br /><br />Can you choose not to breath to the point of death?<br /><br />She shook her head no.<br /><br />So is breathing really a choice?<br /><br />Our brains rationalize instinctive behaviors and that provides the illusion of choice in our life. We think because we choose what to eat we are making a decision to eat and yet if we starve ourselves long enough the animal will always take over and dig through trash bins if needed to get us the calories we require. Sex is an essential part of any animals survival, at least as much so as food and air because without procreation nothing else really matters and so our ability to influence choice is painfully limited. We will almost always try to latch onto the best possible mate we can find and out only decision is how our brains decide to articulate the thoughts that justify this instinct.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If you think you can&#039;t control your insticts, don&#039;t get into a relationship. A relationship is an informal contract. You can fuck 10 people every day and not hurt anyone. Or you can negotiate an open relationship with your partner. It&#039;s not the fact that someone else stuck his dick in the same place I stuck mine, it&#039;s the fact that she breached her part of the contract while I was trying hard to keep mine. If a vendor asks you to FE on a large amount of € and you don&#039;t get shit, you are hurt, because you respected your part of the contract and he took advantage.

				I guess the way I look at it as long as I am the best possible mate for my partner they won&#039;t have any reason to cheat on me and if I fail in some way or someone turns up better than me in their mind than I can&#039;t really blame the person for trying to get the upgrade. I don&#039;t take it any more personally than someone setting down a bunch of bruised bananas in the store in favor of some less bruised ones. The fact is it&#039;s nice if someone looks us in the eyes and says &quot;Hey I don&#039;t like you any more so I&#039;m going to go fuck someone else now.&quot; but regardless of whether they have the conversation the end result is the same.<br /><br />Marriage is a legal contract and even that isn&#039;t broken by having an affair... it&#039;s broken by getting a divorce. Dating implies that both people are still shooing around otherwise they would just get married.<br /><br />I get it, no one want&#039;s to be tossed aside for someone else, all I&#039;m saying is that regardless of how sophisticated we think we are people are going to continue to do it all the time because it&#039;s in our best interest as a people and a species to get the best possible mate we can and I just don&#039;t see how it really matters if someone breaks up with you first or not when the end result is the same.

				I think the better mate thing is bullshit. I know lots of cases of attractive girls that they&#039;re boyfriends cheated on with uglier girls or girls that were in a relationship with some rich good looking guy and cheated with some broke borderline retard. It&#039;s about people thinking they can get away with whatever shit. It&#039;s like doing drugs not because you&#039;re curious about them, just because you shouldn&#039;t but you can.

				There is no moral difference between men and women, both have the capacity to do all kinds of nasty low down things to each other and of course both can be exceedingly nice to each other which is my preference of course!<br /><br />The Internet has made cheating so simple it really does give some guys a different women every weekend. I&#039;m a one women man so that does not interest me plus if I was single I&#039;d go to the pub as I&#039;d know someone or people they know. <br /><br />Online, people lie even more than real life. And many men and women have been suckered inti thinking they have fallen in love with someone they never met. Often its financial gain as seen with young Thai chicks and guys old enough to be their dads who get sexual gain. But that is consensual and legal - but I feel sorry for men who do that. Yes it sounds great having some 20 yr old but an older guy needs company just as much as sex - and communication is often a problem. I love conversing with women. Sex alone would not cut it. Conversing with 20 yr olds is great for a while. Waking up to them, no fucking way, my head would be mangled!<br /><br />Cheating online is massive, tens of thousands of people in relationships are sending pics of their dicks or video to strangers! A lot ends up on voyeur websites. Sex is better when its the culmination of a relationship. When you have talked to a women a lot and really enjoy their company. Using chat rooms to profess love seems mad to me. <br /><br />I did cheat just once. A good few years back, I was single but I found out the women I got &#039;lucky&#039; with was married and had four kids.<br /><br />Had I been sober I would NEVER have gone near this women but I&#039;d been drinking all day then got an E tablet circa 1990s, every women in the pub was shining and I ended up with a real big girl - I remember I could not move her when trying to move position during out romantic entanglement. She looked like Les Dawson, the UK comedian. I was so stoned, my mates et me up - they convinced me she was a real cracker, I could barely focus and was just enjoying the jukebox and thinking how fantastic the Christmas tree was. <br /><br />So, the next day, I runs into a buddy who told me I has shagged a married women. She never had a ring on, I know that much - I hate cheaters who risk breaking up a family just for a stolen night of lust. But, as it turns out she was a serial cheater, her husband was resigned to it, which made me mad that he was not mad or would not have been if he knew. Nobody knew apart from my mates who saw me grope her at a house party. <br /><br />I felt real bad though and promised I would always check up if I ever got lucky. I was lucky this women had a husband who accepted she was basically in need and he could not give! So, although I was wrong I don&#039;t feel as bad as I would if it would have been messy&nbsp; - a break up just because of a one night stand.&nbsp; <br /><br />People in relationships ought to talk more. Sex is important and its your duty when in a relationship to keep your partner satisfied so she or he does not need to stray. I like knowing my women is mine and nobody else goes with her. <br /><br />I have never cheated when in a relationship.

				I&#039;ve been cheated on once, but I&#039;m usually the cheater. I was actually in a 4 year relationship with a girl who I cheated on with maybe near 20 different people. This girl loved me like I was her whole world, and within good reason. When I wasn&#039;t out partying it up and hitting some random chick, I was treating her like a queen. It was strange, I used these other girls as practice, and constantly wowed the main lady in the bed. We broke up about 8 months ago, and I still miss her, but for her sake, it&#039;s better I avoid her. I&#039;m seeing someone else now, who&#039;ve I&#039;ve been with for a month. I haven&#039;t cheated on her, and I told myself I wont, but I got a girl who wants her first acid trip to be with me and another who wants her first roll to be with me.<br /><br />Why is life so hard?

				Yep. Both...<br />I&#039;ve learned from my past relationship that men (in my mind) are hard-wired to have a sort of harem or at least multiple partners.<br />With my current partner (who is a very loving man and has been damaged in the past as well) has stated that when he loves someone, it&#039;s only them. He doesn&#039;t need anyone else, just me.<br />....now in my conditioning and distrust of the statement &quot;I won&#039;t cheat on you&quot; I&#039;ve told him at the start of our relationship, that if I can&#039;t give him something that he needs, he has my full permission to go get what he needs, so long as I am aware.<br /><br />Question for all of you? Is this a slippery slope? What am I conveying to him? (in your silkroader&#039;s eyes) Is this just a baadd idea introducing another person into our dynamic? Whether it be a 3-some or individual&nbsp; sex partner change up or whatever....?<br /><br />I guess the whole thing is this:<br />I love you but i know a man and you&#039;re not made that way to stay with me forever so if you feel the urge or are seduced, let me know and that&#039;s fine. I give you permission to find a way to fulfill those needs and teach me how i can do that for you....<br />Thoughts????

Both...<br />I&#039;ve learned from my past relationship that men (in my mind) are hard-wired to have a sort of harem or at least multiple partners.<br />With my current partner (who is a very loving man and has been damaged in the past as well) has stated that when he loves someone, it&#039;s only them. He doesn&#039;t need anyone else, just me.<br />....now in my conditioning and distrust of the statement &quot;I won&#039;t cheat on you&quot; I&#039;ve told him at the start of our relationship, that if I can&#039;t give him something that he needs, he has my full permission to go get what he needs, so long as I am aware.<br /><br />Question for all of you? Is this a slippery slope? What am I conveying to him? (in your silkroader&#039;s eyes) Is this just a baadd idea introducing another person into our dynamic? Whether it be a 3-some or individual&nbsp; sex partner change up or whatever....?<br /><br />I guess the whole thing is this:<br />I love you but i know a man and you&#039;re not made that way to stay with me forever so if you feel the urge or are seduced, let me know and that&#039;s fine. I give you permission to find a way to fulfill those needs and teach me how i can do that for you....<br />Thoughts????<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i was in something of a similar situation with my ex when she wanted sex and i was like ok just tell me when and we&#039;ll hop to it but she wanted me to initiate it every time which would happen quite rarely because i was/am quite deeply depressed and just don&#039;t have that much interest in sex most of the time. she never really knew the extent of my depression, that i constantly fixate on suicide, traumatic memories, negative aspects of my life, just shit.. but yeah i&#039;ve always found that to be the case, the other person wants it way more than i do. when we did long distance for a year and she complained about being frustrated i suggested to her that she could have sex with anyone she wanted just don&#039;t tell me about it and it turns out that&#039;s not the right thing to say to a girl who&#039;s in love with you lol. so i think i get where you&#039;re coming from in wanting the person you love to be satisfied, it&#039;s the other person and how they feel personally that is important. if he says his needs can only be fulfilled by you then that&#039;s a good sign of his character imo, it&#039;s awesome to have someone who cares that much about you. as to whether introducing a third person would be good or bad, it works for some people which is fair enough but (i assume you are a girl... i am too btw) anecdotal evidence suggests it&#039;s easier for men to have multiple partners than it is for their partner to deal with their infidelity. no comments on polyamourous relationships except beware of the evil love triangle! and i&#039;m not talking about vaginas. god i am hilarious ::) can you just fake it and get him there fast? it&#039;s a lot easier to fake it with men or as we are on sr there&#039;s some drugs that would make you feel more up for it. i bet you were expecting something more useful after that ridiculous essay. sorry. you sound kinda like me in that i think about other peoples needs above my own so i guess don&#039;t make the same mistake i did and bottle everything up and pretend you&#039;re fine or they&#039;ll think they are the problem and you could lose them. he sounds like a good guy so just keep communicating and hopefully he will be understanding about whatever your situation.

The world is overpopulated and yet we still keep making babies. The governments of the world are corrupt and yet we still keep paying them taxes. The foods we eat are filled with toxic poisons that slowly kill us and yet we still eat them. The cars we drive and the products we consume are destroying the planet and yet we still keep using them.<br /><br />It sounds all good and well to try and place us in some sort of evolved status as a species but in reality we still just do whatever comes most naturally and easily for us. Relationships really aren&#039;t all that different. We aren&#039;t looking to advance some social cause when we partner with someone we do so to advance our personal cause and as such relationships are intrinsically selfish affairs in which the feelings of others are of much less importance than the feelings of self.<br /><br />If I put you on an island with one other girl that girl is probably going to become your mate. If I drop fifty much more attractive females on the island dose anyone really doubt what is going to happen? Call it what you want and create any rules you see fit but the reality is you are just creating an intellectual means to justify an instinctual end. The fact that cheating violates a rule you imagine exists doesn&#039;t really change the fact that people are still going to do it and there&#039;s nothing inherently right or wrong about it. It is simply humans being human across all cultures and time.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh D, where art thou?&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />
