				What is with the aussie sellers rawting with a complete rip off price..?<br />First you got enterthematrix, selling fucking 40 10mg codeine tablets for 30 bucks.. when a script for 30mg ones are like 10 bucks<br />even worse is the 2mg xanax and one acid hit for 40 bucks, going by street price its a buck a mg xanax and 20 for a acid hit so 18 bucks mark up<br />then you got this novocaine cunt, 10 bucks a gram of mushies, with no markdown on the 10g, when you can pick subs free, and still get them 20 bucks for 3g even though the season just ended.<br />Whats surprising is these cunts actually have feedback, so people are willing to get literally fucked in the ass. <br />You may as well spend your BTC on shit that you cant get here.. especially cause of how much of a bitch it is to get BTC here.<br />Now for some reason the whole aussie customs thing is way overhyped, ive got mhrb shipped here, as well as a few knives no trouble.<br />No customs anywhere can be 100%, there will always be shit getting through especially small amounts, people get coke bricks through for fucks sake.<br />I reiterate, boycott these rawters and stop being a pack of gutless wonders.<br />

				If your so top shit DrugsBunny<br />then start up a sellers account and put all these guys out of business..<br /><br />If you think the prices are high, you can contact them and organise<br />to buy in bulk and lower price (if they accept is up to them though)<br /><br />There is obviously a market for what they are selling as you can see by their <br />feedback.. they arent scamming anyone and their products as far as i know are legitimate.<br />Anyways what do you care? if you can get this shit so cheap and easily then dont go to them...<br /><br />If you already have your own sources what do YOU gain<br />from attempting to boycott the FEW people <br />offering product inside Australia.

				I love Australian slang, unfortunately urbandictionary doesn&#039;t have a definition for rawters or rawter. The definition for rawt is &quot;Someone stealing something from anyone or anything&quot; so I&#039;ll have to use that one until corrected. <br /><br />Oh aussies, you&#039;re heaps of fun.

In common usage anyway.)

				hahahaha I was just going to post the same topic!<br /><br />6 x Xanex for 80 bucks..seriously..80 bucks? I have a script for 5 repeats of 50 2mg xanex and at chemist warehouse i get them each for 30 bucks a bottle! If i was a dead shit on a pension or with benefits a bottle of 50 would cost 5 bucks. do the math at how much this matrix cunt is ripping people off. What a mark up<br /><br />And a market for xanex? It&#039;s an awesome benzo and if you go the doc and not looking like some deadshit bogan, tell the doc you are having marriage/work issues and suffering from severe anxiety and they will give you a script! <br /><br />Seriously the shit i have seen on sale in terms of meds is crazy shit. You can get mersies at chemist warehouse..a box of 20 for 5 bucks! <br /><br />FFS!<br />

I went OS for a year and coming back home i couldnt belive the massive jack up in prices for coke, speed, pills and cunts trying to sell prescription drugs at 200% mark up. The thing is the quality is so fucken crap most times that people usually expect to hand over 400 bucks for a gram of sub standard coke. FUck that shits me.<br /><br />I was buying a shitload of high quality coke in the states for a qrt of the price. And dont give me location..we have now cunts who bring a small amount of concentrate and then cut it with so much additives and the pills and speed all produced locally and again cut to the bones.<br /><br />So yeah excuse us for seeing that on SR aussies have managed to rip off people even more and feeling pissed off..sucks when i see shit selling cheap on SR and they dont/cant ship it to Aust.

				You can pick up 30g from me for $7.33 per g INCLUDING EXPRESS POST AND SR FEE<br /><br />Yeah you can go and pick them for free. But if you are like me, active shrooms dont really pop up around my parts, and I will be fucked if I am willing to ID them and eat them let alone ID them and pass them on to friends. I am not as clever as you.<br /><br />Plus I dont make 1c on what I sell. That price is set by my supplier. It takes a shitload of work and skill to produce the quantities I am selling. Its a fair price. 2 grams is a pleasant trip... thats like $20bucks a trip. I would pay that fuckin anyday of the week.<br /><br />Fuck I just got trolled dammit lol<br /><br />Love you drugbunny thanks for the laughs. If you need a hug call helpline on&nbsp; 1300 BOGANCUNTSIFRAWTER ::)

				To all those whining about prices in Australia. Its very simple. You have three main choices. <br /><br />1. Go elsewhere - work your own supply routes out. <br />2. Start up your own business on SR and undercut. If there&#039;s enough demand, you&#039;ll stay in business. If there&#039;s enough margin, you&#039;ll stay in business. If you&#039;re willing to take the risks these vendors are, you&#039;ll probably stay in business.<br />2. Answer the door when the waaaaaaaaaaaambulance arrives.<br /><br />Seriously, it is what it is. Posting utter rubbish on SR isn&#039;t going to change it. At the very least, SR is making it possible for people that find it hard to hook up IRL. If you don&#039;t like the high prices, don&#039;t buy. Most things are still cheaper. <br /><br />Build a bridge - get over it.
