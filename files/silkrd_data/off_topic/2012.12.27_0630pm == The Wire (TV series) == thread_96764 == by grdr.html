				So how much people actually watched these series ? Do you think it&#039;s the best TV show ever ? If you are into drugs you must watch it. Here&#039;s short intro:<br /><br />&quot;The Wire is an American television drama series set and produced in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.<br />Each season of The Wire focuses on a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of character actors who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is &quot;really about the American city, and about how we live together. It&#039;s about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution they are committed to.&quot;[1]<br />Despite only receiving modest ratings and never winning major television awards, The Wire has been described by many critics as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time.[2][3][4][5][6][7] The show is recognized for its realistic portrayal of urban life, its literary ambitions, and its uncommonly deep exploration of sociopolitical themes.&quot;<br /><br />Probably the best show ever in my opinion. if you haven&#039;t seen it please buy or download if you don&#039;t want to pay and at least watch Season 1 you will thank me later I can promise that.

				You get your first discordant opinion from me&nbsp; :) <br /><br />I watched S1-S3, and even though it was enjoyable, i found it to be terribly overrated. It looked like a 90s TV show and I couldn&#039;t understand why everyone was saying it&#039;s the most realistic crime series ever. But anyway, good but not that outstanding. And yes, quite fun to have some point of view form the drug trade side.

				Not to be too much of a patriot and a &quot;racist&quot; here, but all i know is i watched one episode late one night and i was just blown away.&nbsp; Okay, here is the &quot;semi&quot; racist part, there is, or was an actor in the wire who was british and starred in a t.v show in the uk called Ultraviolet, and was the captain in Prometheus.&nbsp; <br />

				The Wire has its flaws and is admittedly a little slow out of the gate, but it&#039;s by far the most realistic portrayal of the inner city drug trade in the United States. Everything down to the street lingo (which even native speakers will have trouble deciphering) is pitch perfect, and it really takes you into that world better than any show I&#039;ve ever seen.

				The Wire is one of the greatest shows I&#039;ve ever watched. Of course the characters are despicable, it just shows how deep corruption runs at every level and how much they&#039;re prepared to live with. But the Baltimoredrug scene &#039;s shown for what it is and not glamorised in any way<br /><br />But shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttt - man gotta have a code. <br /><br />All u all gotta watch it<br />

				I watched the entire series a couple of years ago. I thought it was a great show, but some series were a lot better than others. Series 2 didn&#039;t do much for me at all. <br /><br />Personally, I preferred the Soprano&#039;s. :)

Damn, in Season 5, Roger takes LSD, under the guidance of Timothy Leary. Pretty fun. Also, this show is really about understanding the mindset of the american sixties, which makes it super interesting, but to each its own I guess. Definitely not action TV. <br /><br />Go watch Breaking Bad and tell me this is not the best show ever.

				The early seasons...yes very dated, I suppose since I watched the who series last year over a few weeks, but it was my favorite show I have ever seen...<br /><br />If you are &quot;from&quot; a bigger city like Baltimore, its easier to relate, and it is a lot more true to form than most would think... the gov. (still here), police chief, all of it was deadly accurate, enough to cost people jobs.... you know.. just saying if you happen to be around there.,..<br /><br />Regardless, I thought it was excellent, the 1st 2 seasons, where rough, but it really got going until the last season, which of course the had to try and wrap up 50 different stories over the years..<br /><br />Also, the real life &quot;Omar&quot; just died about 3/4 weeks ago...HE changed his whole life, before the show, but after gave him more ability to do &quot;good&quot;, the &quot;code&quot; was all true.

				I really liked the Wire but I would not call it the best show ever by any means.<br /><br />My favorite part of the show is the rise and fall of Tommy Carcetti from upstart young politician with all sorts of ideals and morals to corrupt politician who only cares about his next political office.<br /><br />I think in general there is a lot of goodstory line in this show, a lot of realism about how people work on the streets, and many other things which make the show good.&nbsp; But it did drag at times and the last season was kind of a disappointment IMO.<br /><br />Love Breaking Bad.&nbsp; Awesome show.&nbsp; Will be sad to see it end this season although I am not sure there is much else they can do.

				The Wire has some of the most authentic writing I&#039;ve ever seen on any form of media.&nbsp; Season 4 is up there with the greatest television season of all time.&nbsp; But season 5, the one about the newspaper, kinda sucks.&nbsp; The creator, David Simon, seemed like he kinda got up his own ass towards the end of that season.&nbsp; I think it had something to do with the fact that he used to work for the very newspaper he was portraying in the show.<br /><br />But yeah, great show.&nbsp; Takes a little while to get in to, but it&#039;s worth it.
