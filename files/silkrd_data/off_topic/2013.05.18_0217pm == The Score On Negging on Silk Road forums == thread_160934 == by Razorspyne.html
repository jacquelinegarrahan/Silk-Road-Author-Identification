				I am sick and tired of A) innocent members being negged for no reason, and B) trolls, who actually HAVE earned their -K score, complain about it.<br /><br />I am also sick and tired of the information on Silk Road pertaining to negging coming from people who don’t actually know what they are talking about (regular members and mods included), as this information is second-hand or wild conclusions reached by people who have been left out of the loop but who will pretend they are an expert about it. (Once again, this includes mods as well as regular members.)<br /><br />There have been many threads on unfair or random negging before, but these have been written by people who have not have had the benefit of my experience, or trolls who go around dumping on people and then bitch about their scores. I have heard multiple members in this category say they earned their bad Karma by “speaking my mind&quot; ....bullshit, they earned their karma by being a dick.<br /><br />Honest reviewers are probably the only people who can really be said to have earned bad karma by “speaking their mind”. As soon as someone starts discussing their negative experience with a vendor or their gear, in come the negs first from the vendor in question, immediately after on the vendor’s shill, and then a little later by supporter members of the vendor in question, who think it is a safer option to neg and say nothing, than to actually address the issue. I am not referring to the trolls, or rival vendors on shills who denigrate a competitor’s product with a dodgy review, but the honest reviewers who have the balls to admit the actual purity of a product differs by as much as 40% from the quoted purity, and receive an influx of negs for their honesty. (It is common practice on Silk Road to send out different batches to Reliable Reviewers and then switch after the glowing review is received. Not a clever way to vend. The Road is literally paved with the skeletons of would-be vendors who do this as they fail before they even start.)<br /><br />Negs can come from a post where you have trolled but undeserved negging can come from A) random negging, or B) people who target a person for months on end every 72 hours by clockwork b/c of some petty little thing they don’t have the balls to bring up on Main. <br /><br />I even heard of a couple of members alleging that they have been “attacked” by one person with several shills, as opposed to the slightly more believable conclusion that they have simply have been negged by multiple members. This immediately points to the likelihood that they themselves have shills. On this forum you hear a lot of FUD, and while you cannot justify your time answering the downright stupid conspiracy theories, they provide entertainment for an amusing minute or two. As is the theory they have been negged b/c misguided people take out their frustration on them whenever Silk Road is down. <br /><br />The problem with talking about issues you don’t know about is that.... some people on the forums DO actually know about this issue and can call you out. If they wish to. I have seen clear and repeated evidence of trolling behind the protection of their position, and going through their writings it is very apparent as to where they received at least SOME of their negs. Perhaps the best way to avoid those negs is to, oh I don’t know, how about stop trolling? Instead of running everyone in their sight down and then complaining about negs awarded them. It’s so simple it should be on the back of a spaghetti can.<br /><br />The random negging appears to be concentrated in the Newbie section and the +KARMA thread. This is public knowledge. If you don’t know this then you have probably just joined. I spend a lot of time just handing out +K in the newbie section, where I can barely justify it, to merely even it up so that they can enter the regular section with a fairer +K/-K ratio. As to who dishes this random negging out, 2 of them are also public knowledge and you can find their usernames on the +KARMA thread when we were talking about them a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Persistant negging every 72 hours can be anyone with no set of balls. Though slightly more subtle they too can be identified with not too much trouble, took me no time at all to find some of them. Another way of finding them is to speak to them. *cough* <br /><br /><br />I would like to hear from anyone who thinks they have been targeted by either random negging or persistant negging. <br /><br />Does anyone here think they have been unfairly negged?<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />[Edit.

				First let me say...well written post and I +1 you for that ;) and I totally understand everything you said...BUT.....<br /><br />Why do you care so much about karma? It so does not matter as long as you are in the +...let me explain..<br /><br />If an account is( +22 and -133&nbsp; 300 post )then you know with out a doubt that the person posting is a complete fucking idiot. PERIOD. It is not like he got the Neg karma for no reason..Not at all..and you can tell when you read one of their post...they deserve it..like Karma does not lie..<br /><br />Now if someone is (+450 -55&nbsp; 800 post )you can also tell they are on top of it..and you will see in there post that they usually write very well and/or they say things that right on. They are not idiots at all.<br /><br />When someone is (+77 -68 450 post) then that is &quot;normal&quot; and again you can read there post and you can see it in what they say.. they are not idiots nore do they say anything that great...they might either way..<br /><br />When someone is ( +87 -93 600 post) again you can see it...not so much because there neg out weighs there Pos but that with the count you can kind f tell again they are close to even/normal but you can see it in there post they are on the moreof a stupid side then a smart one...<br /><br />Now the person that is (+55 - 7 240 post) you can tell in there post that they never post anything saying another member is dumb or that they hate XX or that they dislike s feature that is positive...again you can see it in there post...they tend to be positive and say positive things and stay away from the bs threads on here..<br /><br /><br />Bottom line is the Karma system works.. and yes there is ways to pad your karma of course and people do...there is a fucking thread where these people go in there and the + karma each other!!!! Could you imagine if you were one of those people!! The people in there are the same exact ones that are total haters and NEg other people..that is why they are in there! No one else would ever go...I mean why the fuck does someone care that much??<br /><br />That brings me back to you...honestly...why do you care so much...I read your whole thread...and I liked it..and you made sense..but one thing you never said is why do you care so much? I mean you are obv in the + side of things..and everyone can tell that reads it your a smart guy...BUT that does not answer why you care? Also you have to know that the Karma thing so doe snot matter if you are a positive karma poster...meaning it would matter if you made this thread and your count was +55 -188....I mean first...it would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to write this if you were...(and that is my point) this system actually totally does it&#039;s job...and yes haters will hate...but they usually have the worst Karma..and the great thing is they never get it and even if they create a new account...it stays with them...meaning it will turn out the same...because they do not understand that they are dumb as shit..and this forum has&nbsp; a lot of them.. I should call them out..lol..You would see them run in here and say stupid shit..<br /><br />So I hope you understand my points and I can&#039;t wait to hear why you even care enough to write this OP...I in fact have never seen a post form you until now :)

				Its not that big of a deal. I&#039;m 99% sure Nod is giving me all my negative karma, and if he wants to give me negative karma for teasing and laughing at him, hes welcome to do so.<br />Edit: Right on cue.<br />Edit2: Maybe I should stop talking about this if I want him to stop giving me negative karma.<br /><br />

				To answer your question Raz, yes I have been, for a long time I was -1&#039;d every 72 hours for many months, in fact I&#039;m certain that -50 of my - karma score was &#039;awarded&#039; by one individual, it&#039;s calmed down now, whoever this was, was very dedicated it was every 72 hours without fail for a long time. I&#039;m also tired of the amounts of misinformation that have been posted, either through &#039;Chinese whisper&#039; style opinion or conspiracies so wild they bear no foundation. I value one well informed and well rounded useful opinion than one hundred useless answers. This is the most sensible karma thread I&#039;ve ever seen, it&#039;s not stated by someone inexperienced or a troll, it&#039;s given by a long standing&nbsp; member who has given a lot to this forum and dedicated a lot of his time to genuinely helping others for no ulterior motives apart from helping, Raz is an outstanding member an example of everything this community should stand for, there should be more like him in the world. I feel said for the honest reviewers, as it goes, believe it or not, a lot of my favourite reviewers have sadly received a lot of news, vendors should listen and respect honest opinions, I value an honest review far more than a dishonest 5/5 review, I believe a 5/5 should only be given if truly deserved, I don&#039;t believe a 5/5 review should be given just because a member feels obligated to, a 5/5 should be honest and earned. If a vendor states purity it should be that purity, for example, if you walked into the supermarket and purchased a kilo of sugar only to get home and find out it&#039;s half a kilo of sugar would you be pleased? No! The same should apply here descriptions should always be honest. As for the issue of shilling I agree too, it&#039;s far more logical to believe multiple members have nudged rather than one with multiple shills, I&#039;m not saying that shilling doesn&#039;t happen it does, but to the extent of the accusations is a little far fetched in my honest opinion. Unfortunately, a lot of nagging happens ironically within the +KARMA thread and &#039;Newbie discussion&#039;, why I don&#039;t know, only those responsible know their reasoning.

				you have become a full member before handing out karma<br /><br />its not a big deal to me, i dont think ive ever negged someone only give + karma and i do it often to many people based on their posts not previous posts or arguments ive had with them. Its not really an issue but it is annoying if someone does the 72 hour neg <br /><br />

The thread was created not b/c I cry myself to sleep over each neg, but rather to address the issue that some misinformation that had been picked up and passed off as fact by people who didn&#039;t know their subject material, and also to raise the additional issues of why are people being negged unfairly, and trolls bitching about their karma. This isn;t about &quot;caring so much about it&quot; as addressing a long overdue issue from someone who actually knows what they are talking about.<br /><br />It leaves a bad taste in the newbie&#039;s mouth as they have been unduly affected for doing nothing more than posting, so this is something that should be addressed. Put yourself in their position -- why should you be automatically negged for simply opening a forum account? And 72 hour neggers really have no place here, this isn&#039;t for highschool students. <br /><br />Because regular members aren&#039;t the only ones handing out negs for petty reasons, ALL members have been included in the discussion.<br /><br />As to whether it&#039;s important, well, let&#039;s go back to the December thread.... I&#039;ve seen vendors here with massive amounts of -K and virtually zero +K, and there is no way in hell I would ever buy from them. Go through a couple of posts, they are too immature to handle a discussion so why would you trust them not to stuff up with your gear? <br /><br />As to the +KARMA thread, that was actually not a bad thread, in fact, I thought you actually liked it. Or back in November anyway. It wasn&#039;t a bad thread back then TBO. It&#039;s changed a little now IMAHO, too commercial and mainstream these days. Maybe it&#039;s time to unlock the KARMA HEAVEN thread *hint*.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Any reason the rep doesn&#039;t have a minimum spread rule attached like most forums?<br /><br />Stops people with a hate boner -1&#039;ing your karma to death (like Princess explained). Idk if you need the 72 hour rule as well but &quot;You must spread some karma around before giving or taking from this person again&quot; worked well in other places I used to frequent.<br /><br />Also had one total not a - and + just one score.<br /><br />Another one that was worthwhile was being able to see who neg or pos repped you, and add a comment if you want to. I&#039;d be surprised if this couldn&#039;t be added on the existing system. Its fun and makes it alot more interesting to get a plus rep and four or five words later saying &quot;plus karma cos xxx xxxx xxx&quot;<br /><br />Just shooting from the hip. Might not be possible but makes the karma system even more beneficial.<br /><br />Cheers - Tel

				I got negged just today. Sigh.

No way to scam there! <br /><br />This is the SINGLE WORST THING A NEW VENDOR CAN DO!<br /><br />The forum reviews are complete junk in this regard! And said review should 100% be considered fake.

Also this is not &quot;vending&quot; and the community in no way shape or form is helped with this kind of review...AT ALL.<br /><br />But there real problem is this person passes this information on as if it is good information...like&nbsp; Razor said happens...and then this poor vendor does this maybe or something like this or even worse...sends out 20 free packages..because you can get a 5 star review from some &quot;Hero&quot; members for as little as 1 bar!!! And then with is 20 or more reviews he &quot;bought&quot; he then starts scamming..yes I know with the new vendor rules this is a little far fetched...but this does not change my main point...These type of members giving out advice...is TERRIBLE!!<br /><br />And some of these idiots...took 1 hour or less to get to 50...just so they can then come in the forums and give advice! or they took it to 100 so they can give out - Karma..<br /><br />SR forums.....got a love them!<br /><br />

I&#039;m also tired of the amounts of misinformation that have been posted, either through &#039;Chinese whisper&#039; style opinion or conspiracies so wild they bear no foundation. I value one well informed and well rounded useful opinion than one hundred useless answers. This is the most sensible karma thread I&#039;ve ever seen, it&#039;s not stated by someone inexperienced or a troll, it&#039;s given by a long standing&nbsp; member who has given a lot to this forum and dedicated a lot of his time to genuinely helping others for no ulterior motives apart from helping, Raz is an outstanding member an example of everything this community should stand for, there should be more like him in the world. I feel said for the honest reviewers, as it goes, believe it or not, a lot of my favourite reviewers have sadly received a lot of news, vendors should listen and respect honest opinions, I value an honest review far more than a dishonest 5/5 review, I believe a 5/5 should only be given if truly deserved, I don&#039;t believe a 5/5 review should be given just because a member feels obligated to, a 5/5 should be honest and earned. If a vendor states purity it should be that purity, for example, if you walked into the supermarket and purchased a kilo of sugar only to get home and find out it&#039;s half a kilo of sugar would you be pleased? No! The same should apply here descriptions should always be honest. As for the issue of shilling I agree too, it&#039;s far more logical to believe multiple members have nudged rather than one with multiple shills, I&#039;m not saying that shilling doesn&#039;t happen it does, but to the extent of the accusations is a little far fetched in my honest opinion. Unfortunately, a lot of nagging happens ironically within the +KARMA thread and &#039;Newbie discussion&#039;, why I don&#039;t know, only those responsible know their reasoning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for your kind words. I also think that it is high time SOMEONE publicly acknowledged your contributions to the forums. I noticed you constantly in the Tech sections, review sections and Newbie section when things where a little different on the forums. I have also seen your tireless support of the mods, which, sadly, has not been returned or even as much as acknowledged by them (I have a mountain of evidence on this), only microRNA and nomad bloodbath -- IMAHO a WAY underrated but talented moderator who sadly never got the support or acknowledgement he so sorely deserved, even as much as a tribute thread or formal goodbye.... also, he&#039;s my favourite mod ;) --&nbsp; have actually acknowledged your support. If they won&#039;t appreciate your hard work, then at least I will have the good grace to acknowledge it, and to opine that the forums are completely different without your contributions. IMAHO, there are no longer enough experts or vets on the forums to put their wisdom in so that we can benefit from them. I completely understand and emphathise with your microRNA/nomad Syndrome -- it seems to be going around like a virus at the moment -- and hope that you finally get the respect, if not from the mods, then from the community here. <br /><br />Some of these 72-hour-people have been discovered, I feel sad when someone doesn&#039;t have the balls to state their mind but logs in just to neg -- sometimes waiting for 2 hours -- and then logs out again. I also think that it is inappropriate for those who are not affected by the 72 hour rule to constantly click [discourage] when they have made themselves look stupid and are called out on their stupidity, and then augment their stupidity further by click-click-clicking on Raz and PrincessHIGH&#039;s [discourage] button. Only 3 people on this forum could possibly give you and I an influx of negs within seconds, and it seems clear as day where they have come from. I am sorry they have chosen to go this way -- they seem to be spoiling for a fight instead of debating the issue like an intelligent person. I will + 1 you up when I can, and thank you for the support though it meant they took out their misguided hatred on you (and me). I know that around 50 of your negs at least have come from the same person with no provocation. You are not supported or even acknowledged for your long and expert contributions to the forum by the people who SHOULD have backed you up, so all I can say is thank you from me, and I know from a few others here you have helped, and that that is their loss as they have increased their workload and deprived themselves of many forms of assistance through their pettiness and they have done that to themselves. + 1 as soon as I can, for months of hard -- and&nbsp; t h a n k l e s s&nbsp; -- work on the forums.<br /><br />Remember PrincessHIGH, what goes around comes around, it is unwise to elaborate here, but the drug world is a [edit.] with many familiar faces at the apex, if you catch my drift. And for the record, I have always agreed with many other members when they have said that you would have made a highly experienced and competent moderator here. You would have had a lot of support, and you still command a load of respect from all quarters of Silk Road, and Silk Road forums.<br /><br />Thanks for your support. :) Happy trails. :) <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I also think that it is high time SOMEONE publicly acknowledged your contributions to the forums. I noticed you constantly in the Tech sections, review sections and Newbie section when things where a little different on the forums. I have also seen your tireless support of the mods, which, sadly, has not been returned or even as much as acknowledged by them (I have a mountain of evidence on this), only microRNA and nomad bloodbath -- IMAHO a WAY underrated but talented moderator who sadly never got the support or acknowledgement he so sorely deserved, even as much as a tribute thread or formal goodbye.... also, he&#039;s my favourite mod ;) --&nbsp; have actually acknowledged your support. If they won&#039;t appreciate your hard work, then at least I will have the good grace to acknowledge it, and to opine that the forums are completely different without your contributions. IMAHO, there are no longer enough experts or vets on the forums to put their wisdom in so that we can benefit from them. I completely understand and emphathise with your microRNA/nomad Syndrome -- it seems to be going around like a virus at the moment -- and hope that you finally get the respect, if not from the mods, then from the community here. <br /><br />Some of these 72-hour-people have been discovered, I feel sad when someone doesn&#039;t have the balls to state their mind but logs in just to neg -- sometimes waiting for 2 hours -- and then logs out again. I also think that it is inappropriate for those who are not affected by the 72 hour rule to constantly click [discourage] when they have made themselves look stupid and are called out on their stupidity, and then augment their stupidity further by click-click-clicking on Raz and PrincessHIGH&#039;s [discourage] button. Only 3 people on this forum could possibly give you and I an influx of negs within seconds, and it seems clear as day where they have come from. I am sorry they have chosen to go this way -- they seem to be spoiling for a fight instead of debating the issue like an intelligent person. I will + 1 you up when I can, and thank you for the support though it meant they took out their misguided hatred on you (and me). I know that around 50 of your negs at least have come from the same person with no provocation. You are not supported or even acknowledged for your long and expert contributions to the forum by the people who SHOULD have backed you up, so all I can say is thank you from me, and I know from a few others here you have helped, and that that is their loss as they have increased their workload and deprived themselves of many forms of assistance through their pettiness and they have done that to themselves. + 1 as soon as I can, for months of hard -- and&nbsp; t h a n k l e s s&nbsp; -- work on the forums.<br /><br />Remember PrincessHIGH, what goes around comes around, it is unwise to elaborate here, but the drug world is a [edit.] with many familiar faces at the apex, if you catch my drift. And for the record, I have always agreed with many other members when they have said that you would have made a highly experienced and competent moderator here. You would have had a lot of support, and you still command a load of respect from all quarters of Silk Road, and Silk Road forums.<br /><br />Thanks for your support. :) Happy trails. :) <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Thank-you too for your kind words Raz, you had so many lovely things to say, thank-you for your appreciation and respect , especially coming from an intelligent and long standing member such as yourself means A LOT to me, your warmth and positive energy has overwhelmed me! I help for helping, I help because I want others to get on and make the most of their time and experience here, if I can help I will by posing with purpose and substance, if I can&#039;t I will always direct a member in the right direction if I can, I like seeing people get on in the world and if I can be a part of it, it feels me with so much happiness and gives me the strength to carry on, I feel I&#039;ve always had a very selfless character, unfortunately sometimes to my detriment (some see kindness for weakness) however I have to stay true to my nature, and a lot of good has come from it, nothing gives me more satisfaction than reaching out to others here and adding value. I miss microRNA and nomad bloodbath, in my honest opinion they were very talented moderators, who showed great diplomacy, and heaps of humanity, they&#039;re dearly missed by me and wherever they are I hope real life karma is rewarding them for everything they gave here. It greatly humbles me when you referred to &#039;microRNA/nomad Syndrome&#039;, I never thought I&#039;d refer to a virus as great, however if you look at the symptoms of this virus which include, &#039;good advice&#039; &#039;common sense&#039; and &#039;truth&#039;, it&#039;s a great virus to have, let&#039;s hope it&#039;s catching ;)<br /><br />Thank-you too for thinking I&#039;d be a great mod, however, moderating - when done proficiently - demands a sizable chunk of time that would currently hamper my effectiveness in Bitcoin vending. There&#039;s so much that goes on&nbsp; behind the scenes, what seems like tranquil waters conceals a tsunami. I think it would slowly break me down over time, both myself and my character, worse still I think it might harden me to the world, and I never want to be&nbsp; hardened, I never want to feel obligated to the extent of feeling I&nbsp; &#039;have&#039; to be here working all hours of the day, I&#039;m here when I &#039;want&#039; to be here. Hats off to the moderators for doing what they do because when done correctly it is certainly demanding.<br /><br />It saddens me how underrated and unappreciated you are Raz, I&#039;ve seen you post tirelessly and so selflessly, helping out whoever you can wherever you can, sometimes without even getting as much as a thank-you. Is it really that hard to say thank-you or if not simply hit the [thank] button when someone is deserving? You&#039;ve given so much to receive so little in return. Never forget you are a great forum member and a beacon of inspiration to this community, people should start paying more attention to what you say, as you have so much value to add here. I value the points you have raised here in this post, I value your posts, and I value you as a person. Thank-you for being you Raz don&#039;t ever change, thank-you for your support, and I wish you happy travels ahead :)

The &#039;Silk Road discussion&#039; forum is for discussion of issues and topics relating to the Silk Road marketplace. This is a discussion about forum karma, thus it is an &#039;Off topic&#039; issue.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for clarifying that the marketplace and the forums are two different sites, I am sure PrincessHIGH is well aware of that though. I notice that &quot;How much less is considered an &quot;underweight package&quot; &quot; is not in Shipping, but in Discussion. Technically, this could mean that the entire Shipping section should merge with Discussion, as it deals with product traded on the marketplace. It also means that the entire Philosophy section is now supposed to somehow be put in Off topic, as this whole section is clearly nothing to do with Silk Road marketplace. It also means that about 75% of Security, too, should be in Off topic, as a lot of this is cryptography and system security. This approach seems very weird and I think a lot of us are wondering why it has been changed in the first place? Over the last week I have noticed as much as 75% of the Discussion section churned into the Off topic, possibly under this new philosophy. I have also noticed that a thread from another member to discuss this was started, though, one of his questions – why is there such a sheer volume moving – was unfortunately not answered.<br /><br />As it stands Off topic has become the dumping ground for what was previously accepted in Discussion. Both myself and apparently others are wanting to know what this will actually accomplish over the former approach. You do realise that, if everything is unilaterally churned into Off topic then there is no chance for members to be informed of important developments? Off topic was the second fasted moving section and this will only push the threads into archive range at a faster rate so you see where we are coming from. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but one would wonder what possible benefit this new approach might serve? I have to be honest -- and I have a right to state my opinion -- it seems a tad convenient that my thread was immediately moved off the most frequently viewed section on the forums the instant mod negging was brought up. As it stands, there is still a plethora of threads that are still in Discussion that you have basically said should be moved, as they do not have anything to do with the marketplace.<br /><br />If, like you said, everything that is not related directly to the marketplace….<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1142134#msg1142134">Quote from: Libertas on May 18, 2013, 09:40 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The &#039;Silk Road discussion&#039; forum is for discussion of issues and topics relating to the Silk Road marketplace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />….. then could you kindly explain why these threads are still in Discussion? <br /><br />The Darknet vs the real dark network. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161228.0 <br /><br />Am I just smart or are my friends just really stupid? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160098.0 <br /><br />SR Stronger? http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161145.0 <br /><br />Thank you to everyone anyway http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160794.0 <br /><br />We need to know what you consider “Off topic” so it does not happen again? The above threads do not directly relate to Silk Road so we would like to know what you consider the difference here between these four threads and mine. I am asking this in all seriousness as I need to know where to post, as you now consider some things Off topic based on strange and peculiar new criteria only you have access to, as opposed to the former normal way of doing things.<br /><br />Another thing, as this is right on topic. I took a week off forums and my karma was untouched. Since I have started this thread my karma has jumped from -59 to -68 in 24 hours upon even vaguely referencing that mods were going off second-hand information without even bothering to contact the right sources, and negging selected people constantly as a result, and that nomad bloodbath was a good moderator. Also, PrincessHIGH was negged within one minute when she mentioned that nomad was a good moderator too. Sorry but I find all these little coincidences just little too convenient. Perhaps you could assure PrincessHIGH and I there are no hard feelings present and that we have the right to like one moderator over another without any jealousy arising? Or we might start to get the wrong idea? <br /><br />I also checked a post you wrote the other day. You wrote we were free to express any opinion we liked b/c the forums was a “free” place. Are we still allowed to write threads and pay tribute to good mods like microRNA, Guru and nomad bloodbath without getting negged? If everyone is getting negged – and we have established who by, as we have been closely monitoring your actions since this wild negging began – when other mods are brought up, then this is a serious issue and you need to tell us immediately.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t send you &quot;a copy of the &quot;official&quot; sr forum rules&quot; as we don&#039;t actually have any. Sorry about that. However, we are not just going on my insane thought processes, no. We are going by the description found beneath each sub-forum that details what should be put there. Not sure why it bothers you so much, but then you do seem to get bothered by most things. :-\<br /><br />As for my reasoning: coming from you, that is very rich indeed.<br /><br />Your meltdown in the &#039;Need advice&#039; thread speaks volumes about what you consider &#039;reasoning&#039;:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159966.0<br /><br />Though you&#039;ve edited all your posts, people can get a very good idea of what you were saying from the quotes in the posts of others.<br /><br />I have explained quite clearly - twice, in fact - the reasons that this thread was moved from Silk Road discussion to Off topic (you can find them in my posts above). The thread was moved, and remains open for people to post in, so I fail to see what your problem is here other than one of attempted one-upmanship over me. You continue to come across as rather infantile when you attempt to engage in such frivolities, so it would probably be better for you in a business sense - as a vendor - to act a bit more professionally.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really hate to say this, but this post is possibly not the most professional and neutral reply you could have given, given that you are a mod. I always try to find the best in people, but, I struggled to see what your link had to do with the question at hand, which was why you moved the thread in the first place. I am sure there must be a reason but, given my time spent on the forums you would THINK I would be capable of determining the appropriate place to begin a thread. (This is the very first time a thread of mine has been moved) The post was taken up perhaps – from the appearances of it -- getting personal with a forum member that it seemed you are not too fond with, not that I want to get involved. I was a bit surprised to find this written by you, it almost seemed to verge on slinging without quite getting there.<br /><br />Sorry, but what did you mean by this odd comment:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1143167#msg1143167">Quote from: Libertas on May 19, 2013, 05:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ah, InfiniteSource.

Your words are a little confusing lately, I am trying to make sense of them -- bear with me. Silk Road forums members currently sit at 67,992 with 100 members signing up daily. A total of 62,108 threads, 960,852 posts, and an average 1633 posts that are added to the board per day.

Might not be possible but makes the karma system even more beneficial.<br /><br />Cheers - Tel<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think the 72 hour requirement is a great thing to have on Silk Road currently given the high amount of haters that have come in this year. I have no idea where these people have come in from, do we actually have to go recruiting people who are normal and don&#039;t just neg neg neg everyone in sight? I can understand if you are a troll, but some are just haters and shouldn&#039;t be here to start with.<br /><br />So I say let it stay. :) As for spread, I have not seen that, I see some shortfalls though.... 1) it would not stop the neggers targeting someone, as they could merely + 1 their friends and then return to neg, and B) it may give genuine trollers and scammers wriggle-room. <br /><br />As for hate boners, well, there are too many at the moment and it would be good to get rid of them. It comes down to intellect. People who neg are usually people who aren&#039;t smart enough to know how to problem solve, so they neg someone and they neg back, and on it goes forever. Much like in real life, they make a problem out of nothing that eventually bites them in the ass at a later date. In the drug world this is a serious mistake to make -- the harbouring of grudges (like on Silk Road that I have seen go on for years) should best be avoided. Let&#039;s leave it at that. It’s usually over something silly anyway that they misunderstood through their own ignorance. If they went to a psychiatrist their problem would be solved. :) <br /><br />As to the - not showing alongside the + , I think it has the tendency to let trolls and bad vendors off the hook. On Silk Road I would tend to think more information about a vendor is better than less. <br /><br />As to the idea of seeing who negged you and why, that would be enough scare the constant neggers straight (don&#039;t forget our dear old mods, too, have been caught out clicking the [discourage] button repeatedly on a username they don&#039;t like) I think you would find the bad apples too scared to even take a piss without trembling -- which is what is needed.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I briefly skimmed this thread and I think there is a little bit of a loss of perspective here. SR shouldn&#039;t be about total harmony and peace, SR should be about having the balls to say what you think and then be judged on your own merit. If people Neg you then fuck &#039;em, if you are that bothered about being offended/offending someone this forum probably isn&#039;t for you. You should have the brass to be able to take criticism, argue your corner and ultimately accept not everyone will agree with you.

				No, it shouldn&#039;t be about peace and harmony, that&#039;s right, it should be about drugs mainly, and strategies we can use to prevent the LE from taking them away from us, computer security and knowing how to handle LE when they knock on your door. And honest reviews. And yes, I think you should have the brass to say what you want without someone getting all peed off and clicking the neg button. If I was THAT bothered about negging I would have made this thread a long, long time ago. I haven&#039;t been bothered to that point, but there comes a time when you think, yeah I think this crap has gone far enough to earn a thread, especially when you get negged nearly 10 times in 24 hours or so by the same people. Not to mention the newbies section. Apart from that, yeah, I agree with the rest of it. Swap the negs with some brass balls.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

The above threads do not directly relate to Silk Road so we would like to know what you consider the difference here between these four threads and mine.

I stated that in my earlier post here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1142134#msg1142134<br /><br />The &quot;former normal way of doing things&quot; has indeed been upturned a little by my presence, and I&#039;m discussing with the team about whether or not I should take a looser interpretation of what constitutes Silk Road discussion due to that forum becoming less active than Off topic. If we come to a consensus about that, I will reconsider my position on the matter.<br /><br />To address your issues with the threads you provided:<br /><br />The thread &quot;The Darknet vs the real dark network&quot; is a discussion directly about Silk Road and Silk Road ideals, so it fits in the Silk Road discussion forum. There may be a case to be made that it should be moved to Philosophy, Economics and Law and I will consider doing so if we feel it will fit better there.<br /><br />The thread &quot;Am I just smart or are my friends just really stupid&quot; is discussing one users use of Silk Road, and whether using it makes him smarter than his peers. It is a discussion directly relating to Silk Road, so it fits into that forum, though could also possibly be considered Off topic discussion.<br /><br />The thread &quot;SR Stronger&quot; is discussing whether or not people feel that Silk Road is getting &quot;stronger or weaker&quot; now than before, so that also fits in that forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Another thing, as this is right on topic. I took a week off forums and my karma was untouched. Since I have started this thread my karma has jumped from -59 to -68 in 24 hours upon even vaguely referencing that mods were going off second-hand information without even bothering to contact the right sources, and negging selected people constantly as a result, and that nomad bloodbath was a good moderator. Also, PrincessHIGH was negged within one minute when she mentioned that nomad was a good moderator too. Sorry but I find all these little coincidences just little too convenient. Perhaps you could assure PrincessHIGH and I there are no hard feelings present and that we have the right to like one moderator over another without any jealousy arising? Or we might start to get the wrong idea?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What do you expect me to do about the fact that other forum users wish to give you negative karma?! ??? There is nothing I can do about it if people are disagreeing with things you are saying. Not everybody agrees with things that I say either, and if they wish to express that they either engage me in conversation or hit the [discourage] button. That&#039;s just the way it is. Perhaps people disagree with the fact that you care so much about forum karma, something that is obvious when people attract negative karma simply for bringing up the issue of karma in a thread.<br /><br />Do you honestly pay that much attention to &quot;negging&quot;, though? I mean seriously Razorspyne, you&#039;re getting bent out of shape about something that is completely innocuous. Both you and PrincessHIGH could have been &quot;negged&quot; by any forum member for any previous posts you&#039;ve ever made in these forums, at any time. There is currently no way of finding out who awarded karma to whom and for what reason, so everything you&#039;re stating in that regard is conjecture, and you&#039;re quite possibly linking two completely unrelated events to one another. Coincidence or not, there is literally nothing we can do about this.<br /><br />I can assure you that I have no reason to have &quot;hard feelings&quot; against anyone. You both contribute to the community here and your contributions, regardless of their topic, are appreciated as they stir discussion on issues and encourage more community members to get involved. That is ALWAYS a good thing in my books.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I also checked a post you wrote the other day. You wrote we were free to express any opinion we liked b/c the forums was a “free” place. Are we still allowed to write threads and pay tribute to good mods like microRNA, Guru and nomad bloodbath without getting negged? If everyone is getting negged – and we have established who by, as we have been closely monitoring your actions since this wild negging began – when other mods are brought up, then this is a serious issue and you need to tell us immediately.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are indeed free to express any opinion you wish as this is indeed a free place. How is forum karma impacting on that freedom in any way whatsoever?! ??? You are not being censored, and I will not allow you to be censored. Freedom of speech is my personal number one priority here, and I will protect that in any way that I can.<br /><br />As for &quot;closely monitoring your actions&quot;, you are more than welcome to do that though I&#039;m not entirely sure what you&#039;re attempting to achieve with it. As I have stated, I have a job to do here and I am going to do it as best I can. I don&#039;t hold grudges, nor has any one given me reason to begrudge them.<br /><br />In any case, doing a job such as this in a community like the one we have here, it is impossible to please everybody. I&#039;m not here to make friends, I&#039;m here to attempt to ensure that this community can operate as freely and efficiently as possible, and compartmentalising information so that it can easily be found by looking in the right forum. That job will be done to the best of my ability whether I receive applause or criticism for it, from any corner.<br /><br />Libertas

Glad to see your reasoning behind things.<br /><br />Silkroad forums have nothing to do with silkroad market place, It is OFFTOPIC? This thread was perfectly fine where it was, or perhaps rumor mill? Off topic? Really? I can name about 3 posts on the front page that fall under your official &quot;ruling.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow it never stops..How ironic... a guy that is a vendor(should not be) with one of the worst karma I have seen for a vendor. A known liar. And now too stupid to understand the MODS PERFECT explanation. This tread is about Karma..And Karma is ONLY in the forums. Not on SILK ROAD. And therefore should be in OFF TOPIC. It could not be explained any better, could not be any truer.<br /><br />I know you do not like the truth. Or you are hitting the pipe again. At least you admitting you were on Meth is a good excuse as to why you are acting paranoid and lying. For those of you who do not know...the vendor said his recent....shall we say problems...had to do with him being on Meth. Nothing live dealing with a vendor that is on Meth!!<br /><br />BUT this thread is about Karma...and you junked it up...like other threads have told you..PLEASE LEAVE.<br /><br />@Razorspyne<br /><br />Thanks for the explanation! And I hope you realize I was &quot;asking&quot; the question because i really wanted to know why you made this thread...and your answer was/is perfect...THANKS!!<br /><br />and I did like No thread...I just do not&nbsp; like the idea of what I saw where people went in there to get &quot;fake&quot; + karma...though I do understand not all did..And I felt Nov was diff.<br /><br />I know I am going to get hit with the -K when I attack others and use my long posting skills ;) as I call a lot out...but it really does not matter for me..I really only care about the SR feedback. <br /><br />Btw great post @princess...<br /><br />One thing that has changed in here over the past year is the amount of new forum accounts that go through that fake 50 post thing...just to get to post in here and then make a buch of post not know a thing...I mean not a thing!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol, brought up a good point the other day.... some people on the +KARMA thread are the ones who themselves neg. :-\ Just today I saw a mod go and post on the +KARMA thread directly after negging a member. *cough* Also, a lot of trolls go onto the +KARMA thread after someone has negged them for some trolling -- having earned it -- and expect to be +&#039;d. And finally, the majority of posters now just post without doing anybody. So in this way that thread has changed. It has become a disgrace in recent times. Go back to this time last year and it seemed a different place. (I really liked KARMA HEAVEN :&#039;( ) IMAHO, nomad bloodbath needs to return for a couple of weeks and punch some people in the face ;) for stuffing up his thread. (He takes drugs, too! :D )<br /><br />Ah, shit, I think that the 50 posts thing gets newbies in a spam frame of mind, perhaps this accounts for &quot;filler&quot; threads. But December had a few weird threads too, Is Your Dog Gay or something. Seem to have increased. When I first joined I read the Stickies and used Search. Some questions get asked over and over. Here&#039;s a bigger problem: a lot of vendors are not ready to vend. They have not made a purchase or bought bitcoins and they proceed to get a vendor&#039;s acc./ . You can&#039;t do this and expect not to stuff up. Old vendors are more reliable, I can respect that. (Pity about La Fuente... I’ll wait to see the outcome, just saying though…)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1144205#msg1144205">Quote from: RxKing on May 19, 2013, 04:50 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160798.msg1138472#msg1138472">Quote from: charliegibson on May 17, 2013, 08:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">here&#039;s what i would do. skim the forums to find the people who leave reviews all over the place. these people will test your product, stealth, customer service etc..... they will leave you the proper feedback based on their experience... if they have nothing but good things to say than you better have stock cause they will be coming.....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So this awesome long time forum member and silk road user(except the total opposite)&nbsp; is telling a vendor to skim the forums and fins a person who reviews all over the place??? who the hell is that?? and you guys can read the rest!!<br /><br />Yea great idea for the memebrs..give someone free drugs...have them review you sending them free drugs...then of course that sold , honest review will really help the members with said new vendor! No way to scam there! <br /><br />This is the SINGLE WORST THING A NEW VENDOR CAN DO!<br /><br />The forum reviews are complete junk in this regard! And said review should 100% be considered fake. In this case the vendor will not only be giving free drugs for an &quot;honest&quot; ;) review...the reviewer is just someone looking for free drugs! Also this is not &quot;vending&quot; and the community in no way shape or form is helped with this kind of review...AT ALL.<br /><br />But there real problem is this person passes this information on as if it is good information...like&nbsp; Razor said happens...and then this poor vendor does this maybe or something like this or even worse...sends out 20 free packages..because you can get a 5 star review from some &quot;Hero&quot; members for as little as 1 bar!!! And then with is 20 or more reviews he &quot;bought&quot; he then starts scamming..yes I know with the new vendor rules this is a little far fetched...but this does not change my main point...These type of members giving out advice...is TERRIBLE!!<br /><br />And some of these idiots...took 1 hour or less to get to 50...just so they can then come in the forums and give advice! or they took it to 100 so they can give out - Karma..<br /><br />SR forums.....got a love them!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />IMAHO this IS one of the worst things you could do as beginning vendor, JMO though. No one gives a crap about vendors with fake reviews. Unfortunately, new vendors have made it hard on themselves and others to get set up with this practice. Spamming forums just makes the vendor look dodgy, and their product is never what it is advertised, which frankly pisses buyers off and makes them never buy from them again. If you are a new vendor, why the hell would you want a review from someone who is distrusted b/c of their sucky-suck reviews? One good review from a hardcore nut like PineappleLove is all you need. Failing that – as they aren’t available for new vendors under 2 months – at least someone trustworthy. Only problem I have with PineappleLove is the agreed sample by arrangement, IMAHO, it would be great if they did a single blind review on a shill acc./ ALL the time. But I still like the fellow. He or she is stone cold empty-hearted in their reviews and I can respect that. <br /><br />Also, why do you think the top notch reviewers get to the stage where they simply must “retire”? They are put in an impossible position. I wondered why nomad stopped reviewing but if it is the same reason, IF, then it makes perfect sense. It is not uncommon for vendors to give a premium sample to a respected reviewer, and once the review is written and the orders start coming in they switch, making the established reviewer look either A) like they don’t know what they are talking about, or B) in cahoots with the vendor and compromised in their ethics (full of shit). Either way, their well-earned reputation is shot instantly. I know for a fact that this has happened in the past, and is still happening. <br /><br />And btw, it isn’t far-fetched, it happens all the time. There are vendors here who pull a scam by following this routine, but then change names, only to do it again. They’ve been here for a long time. (I know a couple off the top of my head… no, sorry, make that 3 )<br /><br />Also, doesn’t this post belong in Rumour Mill under Cocaine Reviews or something lol? Oh yeah, we were talking about honest reviewers getting negged.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I notice that &quot;How much less is considered an &quot;underweight package&quot; &quot; is not in Shipping, but in Discussion. Technically, this could mean that the entire Shipping section should merge with Discussion, as it deals with product traded on the marketplace. It also means that the entire Philosophy section is now supposed to somehow be put in Off topic, as this whole section is clearly nothing to do with Silk Road marketplace. It also means that about 75% of Security, too, should be in Off topic, as a lot of this is cryptography and system security. This approach seems very weird and I think a lot of us are wondering why it has been changed in the first place? Over the last week I have noticed as much as 75% of the Discussion section churned into the Off topic, possibly under this new philosophy.

The above threads do not directly relate to Silk Road so we would like to know what you consider the difference here between these four threads and mine. I am asking this in all seriousness as I need to know where to post, as you now consider some things Off topic based on strange and peculiar new criteria only you have access to, as opposed to the former normal way of doing things.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Things that are unrelated to Silk Road discussion are considered Off topic discussions. I stated that in my earlier post here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1142134#msg1142134<br /><br />The &quot;former normal way of doing things&quot; has indeed been upturned a little by my presence, and I&#039;m discussing with the team about whether or not I should take a looser interpretation of what constitutes Silk Road discussion due to that forum becoming less active than Off topic. If we come to a consensus about that, I will reconsider my position on the matter.<br /><br />To address your issues with the threads you provided:<br /><br />The thread &quot;The Darknet vs the real dark network&quot; is a discussion directly about Silk Road and Silk Road ideals, so it fits in the Silk Road discussion forum. There may be a case to be made that it should be moved to Philosophy, Economics and Law and I will consider doing so if we feel it will fit better there.<br /><br />The thread &quot;Am I just smart or are my friends just really stupid&quot; is discussing one users use of Silk Road, and whether using it makes him smarter than his peers. It is a discussion directly relating to Silk Road, so it fits into that forum, though could also possibly be considered Off topic discussion.<br /><br />The thread &quot;SR Stronger&quot; is discussing whether or not people feel that Silk Road is getting &quot;stronger or weaker&quot; now than before, so that also fits in that forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Another thing, as this is right on topic. I took a week off forums and my karma was untouched. Since I have started this thread my karma has jumped from -59 to -68 in 24 hours upon even vaguely referencing that mods were going off second-hand information without even bothering to contact the right sources, and negging selected people constantly as a result, and that nomad bloodbath was a good moderator. Also, PrincessHIGH was negged within one minute when she mentioned that nomad was a good moderator too. Sorry but I find all these little coincidences just little too convenient. Perhaps you could assure PrincessHIGH and I there are no hard feelings present and that we have the right to like one moderator over another without any jealousy arising? Or we might start to get the wrong idea?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What do you expect me to do about the fact that other forum users wish to give you negative karma?! ??? There is nothing I can do about it if people are disagreeing with things you are saying. Not everybody agrees with things that I say either, and if they wish to express that they either engage me in conversation or hit the [discourage] button. That&#039;s just the way it is. Perhaps people disagree with the fact that you care so much about forum karma, something that is obvious when people attract negative karma simply for bringing up the issue of karma in a thread.<br /><br />Do you honestly pay that much attention to &quot;negging&quot;, though? I mean seriously Razorspyne, you&#039;re getting bent out of shape about something that is completely innocuous. Both you and PrincessHIGH could have been &quot;negged&quot; by any forum member for any previous posts you&#039;ve ever made in these forums, at any time. There is currently no way of finding out who awarded karma to whom and for what reason, so everything you&#039;re stating in that regard is conjecture, and you&#039;re quite possibly linking two completely unrelated events to one another. Coincidence or not, there is literally nothing we can do about this.<br /><br />I can assure you that I have no reason to have &quot;hard feelings&quot; against anyone. You both contribute to the community here and your contributions, regardless of their topic, are appreciated as they stir discussion on issues and encourage more community members to get involved. That is ALWAYS a good thing in my books.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I also checked a post you wrote the other day.

If everyone is getting negged – and we have established who by, as we have been closely monitoring your actions since this wild negging began – when other mods are brought up, then this is a serious issue and you need to tell us immediately.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are indeed free to express any opinion you wish as this is indeed a free place.

As I have stated, I have a job to do here and I am going to do it as best I can. I don&#039;t hold grudges, nor has any one given me reason to begrudge them.<br /><br />In any case, doing a job such as this in a community like the one we have here, it is impossible to please everybody. I&#039;m not here to make friends, I&#039;m here to attempt to ensure that this community can operate as freely and efficiently as possible, and compartmentalising information so that it can easily be found by looking in the right forum.

I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t send you &quot;a copy of the &quot;official&quot; sr forum rules&quot; as we don&#039;t actually have any. Sorry about that. However, we are not just going on my insane thought processes, no. We are going by the description found beneath each sub-forum that details what should be put there. Not sure why it bothers you so much, but then you do seem to get bothered by most things. :-\<br /><br />As for my reasoning: coming from you, that is very rich indeed.<br /><br />Your meltdown in the &#039;Need advice&#039; thread speaks volumes about what you consider &#039;reasoning&#039;:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159966.0<br /><br />Though you&#039;ve edited all your posts, people can get a very good idea of what you were saying from the quotes in the posts of others.<br /><br />I have explained quite clearly - twice, in fact - the reasons that this thread was moved from Silk Road discussion to Off topic (you can find them in my posts above). The thread was moved, and remains open for people to post in, so I fail to see what your problem is here other than one of attempted one-upmanship over me. You continue to come across as rather infantile when you attempt to engage in such frivolities, so it would probably be better for you in a business sense - as a vendor - to act a bit more professionally.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really hate to say this, but this post is possibly not the most professional and neutral reply you could have given, given that you are a mod. I always try to find the best in people, but, I struggled to see what your link had to do with the question at hand, which was why you moved the thread in the first place. I am sure there must be a reason but, given my time spent on the forums you would THINK I would be capable of determining the appropriate place to begin a thread. (This is the very first time a thread of mine has been moved) The post was taken up perhaps – from the appearances of it -- getting personal with a forum member that it seemed you are not too fond with, not that I want to get involved. I was a bit surprised to find this written by you, it almost seemed to verge on slinging without quite getting there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will answer this, and then I will not be engaging any further in this thread.<br />Yes, the above post was a little unprofessional, and certainly not up to the standard that I hold myself. However, having that particular member PMing me thinking I was out to get him and him having an all-round breakdown over issues that could have been resolved had he had the maturity to admit that he handled the situation incorrectly, it seemed to be the the most appropriate response at the time. Not that it WAS, of course, but it seemed to be then.<br /><br />The person in question questioned my reasoning, so I linked the thread in question to provide him with the evidence that his own reasoning left a lot to be desired. I have no issue with InfiniteSource; I PM&#039;d him after his previous thread to let him know that he was operating with a massive security issue and all I got was abuse in response, so I thought it should be known that this person&#039;s reasoning was less than sound. I would never divulge any PM information on the public forum that I receive in confidence from a member, so I linked him back to his thread to show that his reasoning is ridiculous and that I wouldn&#039;t be considering his points as being valid if the reasoning behind them is not solid.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148782#msg1148782">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 21, 2013, 12:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry, but what did you mean by this odd comment:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1143167#msg1143167">Quote from: Libertas on May 19, 2013, 05:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Ah, InfiniteSource.

Your words are a little confusing lately, I am trying to make sense of them -- bear with me. Silk Road forums members currently sit at 67,992 with 100 members signing up daily. A total of 62,108 threads, 960,852 posts, and an average 1633 posts that are added to the board per day. Are you managing all this without any agreed on procedures? ???<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, we don&#039;t have any &quot;&quot;official&quot; sr forum rules&quot; apart from the ones governing no sales on the forums, no releasing private information and no mass-spamming. As stated before, this is a free place. We cannot and do not censor people. The rules on most forums are there to censor talk of certain issues and to protect people from liability etc. We don&#039;t have those issues here given the type of community this is.<br /><br />We - the moderators - generally agree on what kind of procedure will be used should certain issues arise, but other than the ones mentioned above, there are no major &#039;policies&#039; in action. Enforcing policies that infringe upon freedom of speech are both unwanted and unnecessary here.<br /><br />Libertas

				Maybe people should only be able to receive positive and negative karma after they have reached 100 posts. Since they can&#039;t give it until them it&#039;s a bit one sided, it would stop people randomly negging newbies who are just trying to learn.&nbsp; Making a spam thread in there is annoying but a bit harsh to be negged about it when they just want to be able to post with everyone else. <br /><br />I was getting regularly negged every 72 hrs for a while even when I hadn&#039;t been on for days but oh well. If you need more + karma you can just go ask for it in the karma thread anyway.&nbsp;

				Apparently, I&#039;m the unwitting battlefield in some kind of hidden karma war.<br /><br />I got -10 karma in a row, and soon as I posted about it, in the last hour a half, I&#039;m at +14/-13.<br /><br />I&#039;ve posted nothing controversial, so this is all related.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad some people are running shills to counteract the shitheads, especially since negging the hell out of newbies makes it an unpleasant experience for them, but really this shit is pointless and needs to stop. It&#039;s a waste of time and resources that could be better spent on other things.<br /><br />Let&#039;s get rid of karma. BitcoinTalk did for the same reason.<br /><br />Edit: +17/-13 for an impressive 30 karma points in 4 hours, but it died down now. I&#039;ll see you all again in 3 days I guess...<br />

				Sometimes people simply don&#039;t think before they act. I posted a thread in the Product Offers section, asking if anyone would be interested in me creating a stealth listing for them on SR main site for a little sample pack, and people questioned my intentions stating it seemed as if I was &quot;looking to work outside of SR&quot; or &quot;I was a scam&quot; ... and within 10 minutes, got -6 karma.<br /><br />In fact, I intended to link just one individual to my SR vendor page, working entirely in escrow.

My neg karma continues to grow daily whether I post or not but I have come to terms with the fact some people just go around negging people, I&#039;m not going to bother complaining about it or offer my opinions on why it happens, each to their own and as the OP loves to say &quot;fuck haters&quot;.<br /><br />Thank you and goodnight&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed. There are far too many people who sit at home buying drugs online, then selling them to their friends; people who seem to have nothing but time. They stir around on these boards, rollitup boards, topix, facebook, twitter, whatever medium is available for them to feel like they&#039;re some center of attention; some embodiment of a better-self they wish they were. Rambling on and on about what their opinions are on every topic they can, acting righteous and superior. It&#039;s pretty pathetic. We&#039;ll be available, and sell to people on these boards who have funny, and/or useful things to say... but something tells us that a good number of the buyers on SR are these types of people. And this is why we&#039;re planning on remaining as stealth and low-key as possible during our tenure on the Silk Road. <br /><br />We essentially got attacked for posting a product offer on the associated forum. Apparently &quot;stealth listing&quot; means we&#039;re trying to work behind the back of Silk Road... and/or our &quot;intentions are questionable&quot; ... <br /><br />Seriously. Fuck the haters. If people don&#039;t like me posting single listings of cheap shit because &quot;that&#039;s not enough to go around&quot; , fuck you. Go buy 30mg Oxys from the next cheapest domestic vendor @ 28.50 while mine are $25, be it a very limited run this month. But somehow, that warranted -13 or whatever the fuck negative karma.&nbsp; ::) Haters. There&#039;s no other explanation... This thread is redundant tho. I also agree there.

I also think that it is high time SOMEONE publicly acknowledged your contributions to the forums. I noticed you constantly in the Tech sections, review sections and Newbie section when things where a little different on the forums. I have also seen your tireless support of the mods, which, sadly, has not been returned or even as much as acknowledged by them (I have a mountain of evidence on this), only microRNA and nomad bloodbath -- IMAHO a WAY underrated but talented moderator who sadly never got the support or acknowledgement he so sorely deserved, even as much as a tribute thread or formal goodbye.... also, he&#039;s my favourite mod ;) --&nbsp; have actually acknowledged your support. If they won&#039;t appreciate your hard work, then at least I will have the good grace to acknowledge it, and to opine that the forums are completely different without your contributions. IMAHO, there are no longer enough experts or vets on the forums to put their wisdom in so that we can benefit from them. I completely understand and emphathise with your microRNA/nomad Syndrome -- it seems to be going around like a virus at the moment -- and hope that you finally get the respect, if not from the mods, then from the community here. <br /><br />Some of these 72-hour-people have been discovered, I feel sad when someone doesn&#039;t have the balls to state their mind but logs in just to neg -- sometimes waiting for 2 hours -- and then logs out again. I also think that it is inappropriate for those who are not affected by the 72 hour rule to constantly click [discourage] when they have made themselves look stupid and are called out on their stupidity, and then augment their stupidity further by click-click-clicking on Raz and PrincessHIGH&#039;s [discourage] button. Only 3 people on this forum could possibly give you and I an influx of negs within seconds, and it seems clear as day where they have come from. I am sorry they have chosen to go this way -- they seem to be spoiling for a fight instead of debating the issue like an intelligent person. I will + 1 you up when I can, and thank you for the support though it meant they took out their misguided hatred on you (and me). I know that around 50 of your negs at least have come from the same person with no provocation. You are not supported or even acknowledged for your long and expert contributions to the forum by the people who SHOULD have backed you up, so all I can say is thank you from me, and I know from a few others here you have helped, and that that is their loss as they have increased their workload and deprived themselves of many forms of assistance through their pettiness and they have done that to themselves. + 1 as soon as I can, for months of hard -- and&nbsp; t h a n k l e s s&nbsp; -- work on the forums.<br /><br />Remember PrincessHIGH, what goes around comes around, it is unwise to elaborate here, but the drug world is a [edit.] with many familiar faces at the apex, if you catch my drift. And for the record, I have always agreed with many other members when they have said that you would have made a highly experienced and competent moderator here. You would have had a lot of support, and you still command a load of respect from all quarters of Silk Road, and Silk Road forums.<br /><br />Thanks for your support. :) Happy trails. :) <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Thank-you too for your kind words Raz, you had so many lovely things to say, thank-you for your appreciation and respect , especially coming from an intelligent and long standing member such as yourself means A LOT to me, your warmth and positive energy has overwhelmed me! I help for helping, I help because I want others to get on and make the most of their time and experience here, if I can help I will by posing with purpose and substance, if I can&#039;t I will always direct a member in the right direction if I can, I like seeing people get on in the world and if I can be a part of it, it feels me with so much happiness and gives me the strength to carry on, I feel I&#039;ve always had a very selfless character, unfortunately sometimes to my detriment (some see kindness for weakness) however I have to stay true to my nature, and a lot of good has come from it, nothing gives me more satisfaction than reaching out to others here and adding value. I miss microRNA and nomad bloodbath, in my honest opinion they were very talented moderators, who showed great diplomacy, and heaps of humanity, they&#039;re dearly missed by me and wherever they are I hope real life karma is rewarding them for everything they gave here. It greatly humbles me when you referred to &#039;microRNA/nomad Syndrome&#039;, I never thought I&#039;d refer to a virus as great, however if you look at the symptoms of this virus which include, &#039;good advice&#039; &#039;common sense&#039; and &#039;truth&#039;, it&#039;s a great virus to have, let&#039;s hope it&#039;s catching ;)<br /><br />Thank-you too for thinking I&#039;d be a great mod, however, moderating - when done proficiently - demands a sizable chunk of time that would currently hamper my effectiveness in Bitcoin vending. There&#039;s so much that goes on&nbsp; behind the scenes, what seems like tranquil waters conceals a tsunami. I think it would slowly break me down over time, both myself and my character, worse still I think it might harden me to the world, and I never want to be&nbsp; hardened, I never want to feel obligated to the extent of feeling I&nbsp; &#039;have&#039; to be here working all hours of the day, I&#039;m here when I &#039;want&#039; to be here. Hats off to the moderators for doing what they do because when done correctly it is certainly demanding.<br /><br />It saddens me how underrated and unappreciated you are Raz, I&#039;ve seen you post tirelessly and so selflessly, helping out whoever you can wherever you can, sometimes without even getting as much as a thank-you. Is it really that hard to say thank-you or if not simply hit the [thank] button when someone is deserving? You&#039;ve given so much to receive so little in return. Never forget you are a great forum member and a beacon of inspiration to this community, people should start paying more attention to what you say, as you have so much value to add here. I value the points you have raised here in this post, I value your posts, and I value you as a person. Thank-you for being you Raz don&#039;t ever change, thank-you for your support, and I wish you happy travels ahead :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you again for your comments PrincessHIGH. You&#039;re one of the good ones around here. I&#039;ve seen how the newbies come to you in preference to other members around here, and the support given from them for your efforts. Your Sensible Discussion thread has run to 20 pages now I believe -- what I would call a successful thread. I agree that you post with purpose and substance, it is very apparent when comparing your posts to other posters in here. There is much depth to your posts, sometimes I feel sorry for the posters who post directly after you b/c you can make them look insignificant by comparison. Keep up the good work with posting, because evolving through constant education is a vital part of Silk Road forums and the only way to get that is with quality discussion. <br /><br />I did not know microRNA but heard he was a very even-tempered, disciplined mod who was technically adept and commanded a lot of respect. As for nomad, well, a lot of people were sad when he went. And I have spoken enough I think, of his talents already to leave off. I agree that moderating -- when done proficiently -- is demanding, not everyone can handle it. Anyone can put their hand up for the job but it is a different story actually DOING that job, and because of that microRNA, Guru and nomad will remain remembered for all the right reasons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for all the encouragement Princess. You get the opportunity when you join to spend your time constructively or dumping on people, I&#039;ve merely chosen the former. I don&#039;t know how to properly answer the rest of your post because I haven&#039;t received credit like that in quite a while on the forums! Sincere thanks, you were always one of the genuines here and you haven&#039;t changed a bit. :) At this moment with all the ridiculous high-school flaming and conspiracy theories of &quot;shill armies&quot; and other nonsense that has sprung up this past week, we need people like you more than ever. Well, I say fuck haters, and piece and love to you, don&#039;t ever change Princess, you are a credit to Silk Road and Keep Calm and Sparkle because you are one of the very best, and I mean that unreservedly. <br /><br />Happy trails :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I notice that &quot;How much less is considered an &quot;underweight package&quot; &quot; is not in Shipping, but in Discussion. Technically, this could mean that the entire Shipping section should merge with Discussion, as it deals with product traded on the marketplace. It also means that the entire Philosophy section is now supposed to somehow be put in Off topic, as this whole section is clearly nothing to do with Silk Road marketplace. It also means that about 75% of Security, too, should be in Off topic, as a lot of this is cryptography and system security. This approach seems very weird and I think a lot of us are wondering why it has been changed in the first place? Over the last week I have noticed as much as 75% of the Discussion section churned into the Off topic, possibly under this new philosophy. I have also noticed that a thread from another member to discuss this was started, though, one of his questions – why is there such a sheer volume moving – was unfortunately not answered.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not getting involved in this thread&#039;s discussion - it is about forum karma, for crying out loud. This is hardly something to be getting in any way upset about or even discussing in detail. It is meant to be a &#039;fun&#039; addition to the forums. I will, however, attempt to answer some of your questions.<br /><br />PrincessHIGH asked for clarification on whether the Silk Road forums were part of Silk Road discussion; whether she is aware of it or not is not an issue - I was asked to clarify, and both her question and my response, are here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1142134#msg1142134<br /><br />The thread discussing why we were moving threads was indeed answered; the member in question was wondering what was up, and I responded stating that we&#039;re simply trying to move things to the correct categories.<br /><br />If you are one day made a moderator then you will be required to make the calls on which categories you believe topics fit into. For the time being, that responsibility falls on myself and the other forum moderators.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">As it stands Off topic has become the dumping ground for what was previously accepted in Discussion. Both myself and apparently others are wanting to know what this will actually accomplish over the former approach. You do realise that, if everything is unilaterally churned into Off topic then there is no chance for members to be informed of important developments? Off topic was the second fasted moving section and this will only push the threads into archive range at a faster rate so you see where we are coming from.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Off topic has not become a &quot;dumping ground&quot; for anything. It has become more active as a result of threads that were in the wrong sections being moved there. Things that were previously accepted by previous moderators as being Silk Road discussion issues are not my concern; if I believe something is in the wrong place then I will move it, unless instructed otherwise by an administrator.<br /><br />Important developments related to Silk Road itself will, of course, be left in the Silk Road discussion forum. I do see where you&#039;re coming from regarding threads being pushed to other pages as a result of the activity in Off topic, but if there is an important issue that affects users use of Silk Road, they will stay in Silk Road discussion as they will obviously be considered pertinent to the topic of that forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I&#039;m sorry but one would wonder what possible benefit this new approach might serve? I have to be honest -- and I have a right to state my opinion -- it seems a tad convenient that my thread was immediately moved off the most frequently viewed section on the forums the instant mod negging was brought up. As it stands, there is still a plethora of threads that are still in Discussion that you have basically said should be moved, as they do not have anything to do with the marketplace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The benefits of this new approach - which I freely admit is being spearheaded by me - is to ensure that the Silk Road discussion forum remains a place where issues concerning Silk Road itself are brought to light and can be addressed and discussed.<br /><br />Your thread was moved from the most frequently viewed section on the forums to its correct location in the second most frequently viewed section on the forums - Off topic - as it is not discussing Silk Road, nor issues relating to it; it is discussing forum karma, which is an Off topic issue (by virtue of not being a Silk Road issue). If there were a &quot;Silk Road forum&quot; forum, then it would have been moved there.<br /><br />You know from my previous responses in this thread and others on the topic of karma that I do not consider karma to be an issue worth discussing whatsoever. If you wish to relate the thread&#039;s move to something, you are, of course, completely free to do that. I have stated the reason that the thread was moved numerous times in previous posts, and that is all there is to it.<br /><br />There are no &quot;underhanded manouevers&quot; at play here.

I notice that &quot;How much less is considered an &quot;underweight package&quot; &quot; is not in Shipping, but in Discussion. Technically, this could mean that the entire Shipping section should merge with Discussion, as it deals with product traded on the marketplace. It also means that the entire Philosophy section is now supposed to somehow be put in Off topic, as this whole section is clearly nothing to do with Silk Road marketplace. It also means that about 75% of Security, too, should be in Off topic, as a lot of this is cryptography and system security. This approach seems very weird and I think a lot of us are wondering why it has been changed in the first place? Over the last week I have noticed as much as 75% of the Discussion section churned into the Off topic, possibly under this new philosophy. I have also noticed that a thread from another member to discuss this was started, though, one of his questions – why is there such a sheer volume moving – was unfortunately not answered.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not getting involved in this thread&#039;s discussion - it is about forum karma, for crying out loud. This is hardly something to be getting in any way upset about or even discussing in detail.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I couldn’t find any mention in my posts where I became “upset”. I merely started a thread on karma. A quick search will tell you that karma is one of the most talked about facets on the forum, so I guess the sheer amount of references and threads started on it tells you a hell of a lot of other people have thought it worth discussing at one point or another. (They’re entitled to btw :) ) But each to their own.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148964#msg1148964">Quote from: Libertas on May 21, 2013, 01:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />PrincessHIGH asked for clarification on whether the Silk Road forums were part of Silk Road discussion; whether she is aware of it or not is not an issue - I was asked to clarify, and both her question and my response, are here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1142134#msg1142134<br /><br />The thread discussing why we were moving threads was indeed answered; the member in question was wondering what was up, and I responded stating that we&#039;re simply trying to move things to the correct categories.<br /><br />If you are one day made a moderator then you will be required to make the calls on which categories you believe topics fit into.

It has become more active as a result of threads that were in the wrong sections being moved there. Things that were previously accepted by previous moderators as being Silk Road discussion issues are not my concern; if I believe something is in the wrong place then I will move it, unless instructed otherwise by an administrator.<br /><br />Important developments related to Silk Road itself will, of course, be left in the Silk Road discussion forum. I do see where you&#039;re coming from regarding threads being pushed to other pages as a result of the activity in Off topic, but if there is an important issue that affects users use of Silk Road, they will stay in Silk Road discussion as they will obviously be considered pertinent to the topic of that forum.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148692#msg1148692">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 20, 2013, 11:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I&#039;m sorry but one would wonder what possible benefit this new approach might serve?

If there were a &quot;Silk Road forum&quot; forum, then it would have been moved there.<br /><br />You know from my previous responses in this thread and others on the topic of karma that I do not consider karma to be an issue worth discussing whatsoever.

Something had to be brought up so I brought it up. I have gathered you are missing a huge chunk of information on this issue Libertas, but I don&#039;t care to go into it, besides, there are more important issues right now like the recent forums downtime. They&#039;re often going down. (Nothing to do with attacks this time, just maintenance.) <br /><br />And on the topic of being upset over karma, someone you know well on the forums has ALWAYS been quite upset over negative Karma. Before I came along and broke it with my 90 pages, she held the record for giving out the most amount of Karma on the +KARMA thread -- around 60 pages or something on a single +KARMA post! She also held the record for not receiving a single neg until over 100. But that was a very different time on the forums though. But my point is, some people, including you, have asked me why karma affects me SO much when A) all I did was make a karma thread, and B) if anyone here is making a big deal about karma, it would be others, 2 in particular who seem for some reason to be fascinated with this subject enough to be constantly posting on this thread. In fact, on her very first neg she was so upset she went through her post history checking to see where she &quot;said something wrong&quot;. (And no I am not naming them.)<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry but there is too much misinformation on this thread -- intentional or not is irrelevant -- for me to not correct you and bring you up to speed. I have not named the 2 people who are more obsessed with karma than anyone else here, so I can&#039;t be accused of anything. I&#039;m not one to take personal matters and air my laundry on the forum, you should know me and my character very well by now to know. <br /><br />I hope this is concluded? No details have been listed, so there is no excuse for someone to feel offended with anything in this post. Besides, you said that this was a free forum where we could post what we like freely, so I will hold you to it.

It will be interesting to see how the forums evolve later this year and the next. Happy modding.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t send you &quot;a copy of the &quot;official&quot; sr forum rules&quot; as we don&#039;t actually have any. Sorry about that. However, we are not just going on my insane thought processes, no. We are going by the description found beneath each sub-forum that details what should be put there. Not sure why it bothers you so much, but then you do seem to get bothered by most things. :-\<br /><br />As for my reasoning: coming from you, that is very rich indeed.<br /><br />Your meltdown in the &#039;Need advice&#039; thread speaks volumes about what you consider &#039;reasoning&#039;:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=159966.0<br /><br />Though you&#039;ve edited all your posts, people can get a very good idea of what you were saying from the quotes in the posts of others.<br /><br />I have explained quite clearly - twice, in fact - the reasons that this thread was moved from Silk Road discussion to Off topic (you can find them in my posts above). The thread was moved, and remains open for people to post in, so I fail to see what your problem is here other than one of attempted one-upmanship over me. You continue to come across as rather infantile when you attempt to engage in such frivolities, so it would probably be better for you in a business sense - as a vendor - to act a bit more professionally.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I really hate to say this, but this post is possibly not the most professional and neutral reply you could have given, given that you are a mod. I always try to find the best in people, but, I struggled to see what your link had to do with the question at hand, which was why you moved the thread in the first place. I am sure there must be a reason but, given my time spent on the forums you would THINK I would be capable of determining the appropriate place to begin a thread. (This is the very first time a thread of mine has been moved) The post was taken up perhaps – from the appearances of it -- getting personal with a forum member that it seemed you are not too fond with, not that I want to get involved. I was a bit surprised to find this written by you, it almost seemed to verge on slinging without quite getting there.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I will answer this, and then I will not be engaging any further in this thread.<br />Yes, the above post was a little unprofessional, and certainly not up to the standard that I hold myself. However, having that particular member PMing me thinking I was out to get him and him having an all-round breakdown over issues that could have been resolved had he had the maturity to admit that he handled the situation incorrectly, it seemed to be the the most appropriate response at the time. Not that it WAS, of course, but it seemed to be then.<br /><br />The person in question questioned my reasoning, so I linked the thread in question to provide him with the evidence that his own reasoning left a lot to be desired. I have no issue with InfiniteSource; I PM&#039;d him after his previous thread to let him know that he was operating with a massive security issue and all I got was abuse in response, so I thought it should be known that this person&#039;s reasoning was less than sound. I would never divulge any PM information on the public forum that I receive in confidence from a member, so I linked him back to his thread to show that his reasoning is ridiculous and that I wouldn&#039;t be considering his points as being valid if the reasoning behind them is not solid.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1148782#msg1148782">Quote from: Razorspyne on May 21, 2013, 12:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Sorry, but what did you mean by this odd comment:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1143167#msg1143167">Quote from: Libertas on May 19, 2013, 05:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ah, InfiniteSource.

Sorry about that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Does this mean that you &quot;don&#039;t actually have any&quot; standard rules to go by? Your words are a little confusing lately, I am trying to make sense of them -- bear with me. Silk Road forums members currently sit at 67,992 with 100 members signing up daily. A total of 62,108 threads, 960,852 posts, and an average 1633 posts that are added to the board per day. Are you managing all this without any agreed on procedures? ???<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, we don&#039;t have any &quot;&quot;official&quot; sr forum rules&quot; apart from the ones governing no sales on the forums, no releasing private information and no mass-spamming. As stated before, this is a free place. We cannot and do not censor people. The rules on most forums are there to censor talk of certain issues and to protect people from liability etc. We don&#039;t have those issues here given the type of community this is.<br /><br />We - the moderators - generally agree on what kind of procedure will be used should certain issues arise, but other than the ones mentioned above, there are no major &#039;policies&#039; in action. Enforcing policies that infringe upon freedom of speech are both unwanted and unnecessary here.<br /><br />Libertas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Once again, thank you for taking the time to respond and being so pro in the way you&#039;ve gone about it. I figured you&#039;d have a rigid policy book for something the size of Silk Road. I agree with censorship having no place here. When you see a mod go around locking threads (recent example) with no explanation, it always looks like they can&#039;t take someone else&#039;s opinion, or think of a clever reply, so they just lock the thread knowing that they are going to lose the debate. It&#039;s happened before a few times, it is still happening now, but it&#039;s good to know that the ones YOU lock are locked for the right reasons. :) <br /><br />Remember, the best way to avoid shit being brought up on the forums is to simply not stuff up in a spectacular fashion, it is really simple, effective logic. Locking threads on whim and other wholesome activities will certainly go a long way to [retracted] and pissing a lot of people off without any gain. You haven&#039;t done any of those things yet Lib and from the intellect you have to have to write what you write in such a quick amount of time, and cover the varied topics you do, you probably never will. Good modding! I love it. . :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

A moderator is supposed to be neutral within disposition. The karma issue goes far beyond the &#039;figures&#039; set before a username, some have adopted it as a way on attacking other members, a form of forum bullying if you will, this is malicious and needs to stop. Perhaps the karma system needs to be done away with altogether, however this would not stop the nastiness and dirty tactics deployed by some members against others. Raz has done nothing but tirelessly help people here and support them, by providing common sense, good advice, and on point posts. I enjoy reading his posts and enjoy this thread for the point of raising an &#039;intelligent and sensible debate&#039; about the karma system, something I have not seen before and something that given the current state of affairs on the forum is necessary. Why samesamebutdifferent given your position and your obligations as a moderator attempting to derail this thread into something it&#039;s not, if it were not for your moderator position, this would be seen as trolling against a long standing hero member. This thread needs to be set back on track, as an &#039;intelligent and sensible debate&#039; about the karma system.

Your posts have become tirades of your conspiracy theories of single members with&quot;shill armies&quot; who have got nothing better to do than log in, click every single post on every single thread on every single section, log out, log in with another account, do it again, log out, and repeat the process continually. This is just embarrassing for a grown man. (Now I know why you stay out of the Philosophy section.) You don&#039;t bother to back anything up with fact b/c you don&#039;t know anything yourself, and when you inspect what you are saying, it is revealed to be BS and FUD issued from someone who doesn&#039;t know what he is talking about, and FUD that no one even bothers to listen to any more, then saying you don&#039;t care about this &quot;horse-shit&quot; but at the same post complaining about your karma. The reason your karma is the way it is, is b/c you troll people and spread misinformation. If you are so worried about your karma then modify your online behaviour or stop complaining about it. <br /><br />And if you really &quot;have more important things to do&quot; why are you not doing them? Why are you pushing your narrow-minded 2 cents worth to the point that you keep coming back to this thread to post? Oh here&#039;s a snippet:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1149971#msg1149971">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 21, 2013, 07:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Against my better judgement I&#039;m going to make one post in this thread, <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can you explain why you have so many posts in this thread?

You have contributed nothing to this thread except troll and FUD. If you have this amount of time on your hands to make post after post on a topic you said you couldn&#039;t care less about, one might wonder why you have this much free time and start to compare you to the other mods -- which, in your case, would not be such a good thing trust me. I went through your post again and I could not find any evidence to back up your theories, however I DID find a very confused tirade of jumbled words that you borrowed in part from me and other members and gnashed them into a few paragraphs of utter nonsense in an effort to say something &quot;witty&quot;.<br /><br />This whole post is nothing but a personal attack from a mod on a forum member that really proves just how unready you are, and at the same time, wastes the other mods time by having to come in and &quot;defend&quot; you b/c you have made yourself look like an idiot. If you are counting on your mod position to troll a member without that member responding then it is perhaps time that your position here be reassessed and given to one of many, many members here who are more capable. I am not getting into a slinging match with you b/c from your posts and PMs that is all you seem to do, and when you are outwitted you simply lock the thread so they can&#039;t respond. You then unlock it at your leisure and have one final dig when you finally think of something to say and lock it again, like you did with the Shits and Giggles thread and InfiniteSource&#039;s thread.<br /><br />Speaking of PMs, you seemed to come out with all this crap about &quot;misinformation&quot; and FUD and personal attacks when I did not respond to one of your PMs. I&#039;m sorry but your PM did not seem to require an answer, it was certainly not a malicious act on my behalf, I was simply managing my time effectively. I&#039;m sorry if I was supposed to be &quot;flattered&quot; but yours is certainly not the only PM I have ever received from a mod.<br /><br />As for you ranting and raving in your post, well, I think we have read enough of your posts to figure out that you love the occasional flaming and adding your misguided 2 cents so don;t be surprised if no one really listens to it, it seems to be a desperate attempt by you to create a mountain of nonsense to cover up the fact that you were called out for not knowing what you were talking about. Every post you make gets more personal and I feel quite sorry for you that you have become so upset over nothing. You have not &quot;refrained from bringing this up since&quot;, you yourself have brought it up. This thread is about karma and you have hardly said anything on the subject except to troll so why are you even on this thread?<br /><br />As for misinformation, that has come all from you, and all you have managed to do is take my OP and post it under your username, which is not very original now is it? I have not &quot;taken a disliking to the mods&quot;, I have promoted the mods more than anyone here on the forums. Anyone who has been here a half decent amount of times knows my many posts of encouragement and support of the mods, so you really aren&#039;t selling that crap to anyone. Sounds like the only person spreading disinformation is you. I have no idea why you spend your time getting hurt and upset over nothing, but each to their own. (I keep having to remind myself that you are a mod, it is easy to forget with all the flaming you&#039;ve done.)<br /><br />Are you finally done with this tirade or are you coming back to post another rant? (Or to lock the thread b/c you seem to do that when you can;t respond to something.)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

This thread needs to be set back on track, as an &#039;intelligent and sensible debate&#039; about the karma system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you for your support Princess, I am very appreciative of your kind comments and keen observation. :) I started a thread on karma b/c there was a fair amount of negging going around that was undeserved and I wanted to get to the bottom of it. I started looking into it in January but IRL put a stop to that. There is also misinformation being spread from samesame as he had gotten second-hand info that he didn&#039;t bother checking before launching into conspiracy theories about unstoppable armies that rained down negs and that he had received 10 negs in 1 day (figure&#039;s risen to 20 lol). He was outwitted in the Shits and Giggles thread not by me, but through his own flawed (and amusing) arguments. I offered irrefutable proof that one of his conspiracies was unfounded but he seemed to be embarrassed and the thread was immediately locked. Since then he has spouted his theories to anyone who has the time of day to listen to his ramblings and has been trolling me on my own thread from the safety of a mod position, trying to derail this thread from its original purpose of an an intelligent look into negging, and disinformation about negging. I feel this is cowardice at its worst, I am familiar with his posts and he trolls heavily, I am aware that he does not answer tech or Silk Road q.s, and I am a little tired of the fact that all he has done on this thread has been to refuse to discuss the OP subject and instead provoke a slinging match based on something he doesn&#039;t even know about. He has not been here long enough to understand the references in the posts (he came late September) and I am trying to be patient with him but he refuses to leave this thread, hanging around and spreading more disinformation. Advice? ??? He has been trolled in past but he always ignores them, so I can only assume his personal feelings have been hurt badly over something to fly into hysterics when I haven&#039;t said a word to him. Sad. Almost pitiable in a way, when you think it is over nothing. <br /><br />Regardless, haters will find something to hate (just read his refreshing posts), and ill-informed people will always put in their 2 cents regardless of the fact it really IS worth only 2 cents. He keeps bringing off topic topics up endlessly, this thread was about negging though. As for negging, well, mine suddenly shot up as soon as I posted something samesame didn;t like, it went up again when he had a little rant just before, and it will raise again after he reads this. I&#039;ll let you be the judge of that. Haters are going to hate. I choose to spend my time more productively and my history here will prove that. <br /><br />Thank you for returning some sanity after it got derailed. I totally agree that &quot;A moderator is supposed to be neutral within disposition.&quot; It is up to the moderator in question however, to oversee their behaviour and if they wish to troll and make personal attacks then that is up to them. Before the thread was derailed reviewers being negged for their reviews was brought up and I wanted to hear from anyone who felt that this happened to them after posting a review. And whether this was a good strategy long-term. I felt it was important to discuss that as buyers need to know who to buy from. Resourceful buyers will look at the review threads before placing an order from a vendor they haven&#039;t bought from before, so this information needs to be accurate, and reviewers should be able to leave this information in Rumor Mill relatively unscathed. As someone who is quite experienced and left on-point reviews I would like to know if you have ever left a review and been negged straight after. My belief is that good vendors should be clearly marked from the average and an effective review system is needed for that to happen. And it can&#039;t be effective if it is not honest. And it can&#039;t be honest if reviewers are getting negged for being honest. Some vendors have been downright dangerous to deal with and they need to be pointed out and ostracized. There has been enough FUD and derailment already from someone with a clear bee in his bonnet, and b/c of his argumentative posting, this has not even been discussed yet. <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to hear that the negging has increased dramatically this week. It seems to be everyone that has posted has been hit regardless of content, and they need to phuc off and get a life. If they spent more time learning about &quot;piece&quot; and love, and less time hating, they would probably get more sex. ;)<br /><br />You&#039;re right Princess, this thread has been derailed too many times by the same person, and needs to get back on track. I want to hear from some reviewers (including yourself), no names need be mentioned so it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

A difference of opinion is not trolling, a difference of opinion is something that everyone should be entitled to here, and it shouldn&#039;t be confused with trolling when it&#039;s not, rather be taken as an opportunity for intelligent debate, something that&#039;s being lost within all of the accusations of shill armies, the FUD, and the conspiracy theories. This thread is none of that, this thread isn&#039;t a &#039;stab&#039; at the mods leave that to the real trolls within the membership, as per subject this thread is a debate about the karma system, and is very different from previous threads which have touched the karma issue before as those threads OP&#039;s were either trolls who deserved their karma or those who wished to waffle on about a subject they know nothing about. In fact, I&#039;ve seen a rise in the amount of waffle on the forum, and if there&#039;s a thread that allows for an intelligent debate, it should be respected and appreciated and it&#039;s OP, as thread like this a rare find. I&#039;ve seen Raz support you, scout, and Libertas on many occasion, I&#039;ve seen Raz work tirelessly and selflessly for the common good of this forum, helping and supporting others to get where they want to be, giving in-depth answers which are truthful, sound, and factual. Raz is a valuable member of this community and should be appreciated and respected, as well this thread for what it is and not for what it&#039;s not.

If you choose to overlook the continuous assertions and unsubstantiated allegations being<br />made specifically against me and scout then that is up to you but quite frankly I had had a gut full and I would invite you to consider who is being trolled here, your interpretation of that is just your perception and you are entitled to it.<br /><br />If accusations are made then mod or no mod I have the right of reply, my preference would obviously be to put an end to all of this immediately which is as simple as all concerned agreeing to draw a line in the sand<br />and leaving it there, I cannot be any clearer than that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well samesame, you finally slipped up on the forums and put your foot in it haven&#039;t you? Now we know for sure who is going around negging everyone. It is clear as day that you have been giving everyone negs with the ability to hand out negs without a time delay in an effort to stuff the karma system. Ever since you stated that the karma system should be dismantled forum members have been receiving massive amounts of negs that are only possible for a mod to give out. You have tried to blame a hidden &quot;shill army&quot; but I have calculated that the amount of negs given to the amount of people, it is not even possible for this to occur even if someone had over 100 forum accounts. Thank you for stuffing up today samesame and showing as very clearly who is responsible for the recent neg spike on the forums. You should be immediately stripped of your position and apologise to everyone on the forum who you negged, you have made it abundantly clear that you cannot handle responsibility.<br /><br />I have seen the way that you have just bullied PrincessHIGH on this thread and am calling you out for the cowardly little man you are. Before you came online and posted your little rant her karma was +732/-82. In the 30 seconds following your post, she was hit with 10 negs and her karma went to +732/-92. When Lib posted, her negs continued to skyrocket, receiving 1 neg per minute. Princess&#039;s karma is currently +732/-96. Meaning that all this talk of Silk Road forums being a &quot;free&quot; place and that no one is being censored, utter crap. She has received 14 negs in the space of minutes for a post that was faultless, and you have been stupid enough to keep clicking [discourage] to the point that this is clear proof you have been tampering the karma system all along. Symmetry, the new admin, who has never made a post has a karma rating of +2/-0 meaning their karma has been directly modified from the phpMyAdmin which only admin of a forum have access to, it is not possible to receive karma from members without a post. If you neg someone 14 times in the blink of an eye for showing a fellow long-time member support, and for asking some pertinent questions that you didn&#039;t agree with, then you should not be modding as it reveals you do not have the mental capacity to contribute to this forum in that position, it is simply too demanding for your current capabilities. I have noticed you increasing you buddies karma by as much as 30 in 48 hours, so I think we can clearly see you have abused this unlimited karma ability. You&#039;ve admitted you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; long posts b/c your head hurts, you can&#039;t answer tech questions, you are uncomfortable in the Philosophy section, and have just abused the unlimited karma ability to give PrincessHIGH a slab of negs in 30 seconds, and are now giving her a neg every 15 minutes or so in a way that is clearly personal, unprovoked and a clear abuse of moderating. You have really showed us just how &quot;capable&quot; you are at this job and what kind of weak, insipid personality you have IRL. If this is how you use you moderating position, to bully and intimidate well-respected and esteemed members of the forums over something so petty, then simply GTFO the forum and hand over the position to someone else, as there are simply too many people here who would be a real asset here.<br /><br />Now. As to your post that took you a whole day writing. Is this it? Is this what you left the forums for yesterday when, for the first time in a long time, the spam overfilled into ALL sections b/c no one was modding for an extended length of time? We had to bump the spam down until it was taken care of. Okay samesame, what drivel have you come up with this time?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1180300#msg1180300">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 30, 2013, 09:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176555#msg1176555">Quote from: PrincessHIGH on May 29, 2013, 11:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176125#msg1176125">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 29, 2013, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This response from samesamebutdifferent, has quite frankly, shocked me.

Perhaps the karma system needs to be done away with altogether, however this would not stop the nastiness and dirty tactics deployed by some members against others. Raz has done nothing but tirelessly help people here and support them, by providing common sense, good advice, and on point posts.

I was away for over a week and you still kept posting your crap. You seem to have a LOT of free time on your hands for a mod.<br /><br />As for this crap about not supporting mods, no one is buying it. My posts, PMs, and initiatives speak for themselves. Princess and myself have both given more support to mods than most. I thought I cleared this up before? You;re not being trolled samesame, you are trolling me and your recent posts give a pretty good indication of how personal and vitriolic you have been over nothing. You have been aggressive over an issue where there WAS no issue, if you can become all upset over nothing then it doesn&#039;t say a lot for your ability to cope under pressure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1180300#msg1180300">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 30, 2013, 09:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176555#msg1176555">Quote from: PrincessHIGH on May 29, 2013, 11:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176125#msg1176125">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 29, 2013, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If accusations are made then mod or no mod I have the right of reply, my preference would obviously be to put an end to all of this immediately which is as simple as all concerned agreeing to draw a line in the sand<br />and leaving it there, I cannot be any clearer than that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, if you really wanted to &quot;put an end to all of this immediately&quot; why have you constantly kept coming back to this thread to troll and make personal attacks on an OP and long time member? You obviously enjoy coming back here and think this is some kind of a game. Grow up and move out of your parent&#039;s house. My observation is that there is a lot of maturing that needs to take place here. Clicking on a member&#039;s karma 14 times instantly doesn&#039;t say a lot about you. Don;t deny you did this, b/c we have caught you out doing it through your own stupidity. Children neg. Not adults.

You want to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; with PrincessHIGH? You&#039;re kidding right? Are you challenging her? Boy oh boy, samesame, you have a lot to learn so don&#039;t be stupid. Be -- VERY -- careful who you challenge around here. My advice to you is to get back to your version of &quot;modding&quot; and to stop antagonizing forum members who have served this community well, in more ways than you would know.<br /><br />The person that you have chose to bully and neg 14 times in 30 seconds is a well respected member of Silk Road and its forums. She has given tirelessly of herself and before she became busy with vending -- she&#039;s currently the top bitcoin vendor -- she used to give expert coke reviews from the perspective of someone who thoroughly knows what she is talking about. She also was a familiar face in the newbie section and tech sections -- more than you have done samesame -- and regularly taught PGP encryption both on the PGP Club and via PMs. She has the highest amount of positive karma on the forums and it has not come from posting daily in on the +KARMA thread either -- she hardly posts there. If you think she is anyone to trifle with, and are stupid enough to get into a long grudge match of you negging her every day and basically being immature -- then you may perhaps become familiar with the old adage that what goes around comes around. This is a drug forum. Don&#039;t be stupid by pissing off unknown quantities around here.<br /><br />And stop NEGGING PEOPLE!! We now know that you&#039;re the little cunt that has negging everyone on the forums the last week and you need to grow the fuck up.<br /><br />If you lock this thread we&#039;ll know you&#039;ve been outwitted and simply can&#039;t respond. (You often lock threads in this fashion)<br />If my account is banned or deleted, it will be as clear as day you&#039;re a spiteful little man who can&#039;t be trusted to mod without abusing your position.<br />If you respond on this thread again, then it mean you wish to engage in a petty little grudge match with endless trolling and slinging and discredit the OP.<br />If my negs go up suddenly after posting, or even in the same 1-every-15-minute way you have targetted Princess, then you&#039;ll be seen as someone who prefers to troll and abuse the karma function than to mod.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />PS A special mention to samesame who made it easy for me through his own stupidity :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +732/-82<br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately after posting: +732/-97<br /><br />Raz&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +500/-80

Nothing implied any threat and I think that you are taking this out of context, even if unintentional. samesame was picking a fight with Princess by negging her 14 times -- and please don&#039;t disrespect my intelligence and say I&#039;m wrong -- and talking about &quot;drawing a line in the sand&quot; for christ sake.

My point is ignore the karma count as I said most people know who are the good users and ignore any karma mark they have. That&#039;s all.&nbsp; This could feed certain trolls making them more active and negging just because they disagree with the users opinions even if it is based of fact just because they don&#039;t like them hence why they should not be taken seriously and you still know the really good users have a overwhelming number of positive marks which shows good and responsible users do appreciate and will always out number the inmature ones.

				Good to see you can quote and have enough intellect to get through the &quot;pc for dummies book&quot; proud of you bud , perhaps your father motivated you to finish it so you could put together a few words , just enough to be able to purchase drugs from the internet in a last ditch attempt to increase brain capacity so you could complete out that welfare form. Lol no more personal attack , I have beat you and jaywind in every argument , I continue to , I offered constructive and no biased posts which are based on fact and experience while your child porn sense of humor got you nowhere besides now having to derail the thread to bring attention to me knowing you may have to read the book again as it seems to have gone in one ear and out the other.<br /><br />My condolence&#039;s you can not win a argument where you have all the time in the world to respond and I apologise your sense of humor is depraved and I apologise you are convinced typing like THIS in capitals will get your point across further.

I&#039;m being honest here. The nudism and child porn shit was bullshit that I was copying and pasting to try to get a rise out of people here. Libertas edited everything I posted before I could really get any reactions. I noticed that he even edited posts that had nothing to do with cp though and I felt that it was wrong and he was crossing the line and well, I enjoy trolling so I made this thread, BUT I honestly do believe life was better a century ago and earlier. I honestly believe that. Read what I have written in the 1900s thread, minus the parts of the first post that have to do anything with sexuality, I mean that shit is kind of true but that has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />No television, no fake drivel scaremongering news, no nuclear waste, no irradiated ocean water, no pollution, less crime, none of this corruption that is so rampant, no processed foods, no high fructose corn syrup and a lot of other stuff. I do believe that it was a better life. Yes we have better medical technology now but in my opinion it does not outweigh the benefits of the older days. That is how i really feel.

				That is the whole thing. Resorting to a pathetic joke and topic like child porn isn&#039;t funny and you knew people would respond to it but why even think of it? Yeah there were good times back then and positives I am sure but considering how we grew up and in which era I doubt we would enjoy and survive for very long under the conditions that were around in the 1900s. It may sound good in writing but in real time I don&#039;t think you would last a day. I just can&#039;t see it....brb got to do a dump no toilet paper , brb shaving with no decent products , no aftershave you may think it is petty but dude it would effect you.<br /><br />Change would be dramatic. If you grew up then you wouldn&#039;t have the opportunitys you have now , couldn&#039;t travel the world or have access to tools such as the net for resources such as education , travelling , medication&nbsp; , no blood tests at local gps , no scanning machines to detect horrible diseases. People died of the common flu back then.<br /><br />Anyways kudos for admitting your flaws , first step in acknowledging and wanting to change. Next would be to request a username change in order for people to take you seriously.

I have refrained from bringing this up since because I had hoped you would just leave it alone but all I keep seeing is more and more misinformation being posted by you so my patience on the matter has run out.<br /><br />Please, get a new hobby and get back to trying to help instead of this divide and conquer bullshit you are trying (and failing) to pull because you are not fooling anyone. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> This response from samesamebutdifferent, has quite frankly, shocked me.

Now we know for sure who is going around negging everyone. It is clear as day that you have been giving everyone negs with the ability to hand out negs without a time delay in an effort to stuff the karma system. Ever since you stated that the karma system should be dismantled forum members have been receiving massive amounts of negs that are only possible for a mod to give out. You have tried to blame a hidden &quot;shill army&quot; but I have calculated that the amount of negs given to the amount of people, it is not even possible for this to occur even if someone had over 100 forum accounts. Thank you for stuffing up today samesame and showing as very clearly who is responsible for the recent neg spike on the forums. You should be immediately stripped of your position and apologise to everyone on the forum who you negged, you have made it abundantly clear that you cannot handle responsibility.<br /><br />I have seen the way that you have just bullied PrincessHIGH on this thread and am calling you out for the cowardly little man you are. Before you came online and posted your little rant her karma was +732/-82. In the 30 seconds following your post, she was hit with 10 negs and her karma went to +732/-92. When Lib posted, her negs continued to skyrocket, receiving 1 neg per minute. Princess&#039;s karma is currently +732/-96. Meaning that all this talk of Silk Road forums being a &quot;free&quot; place and that no one is being censored, utter crap. She has received 14 negs in the space of minutes for a post that was faultless, and you have been stupid enough to keep clicking [discourage] to the point that this is clear proof you have been tampering the karma system all along. Symmetry, the new admin, who has never made a post has a karma rating of +2/-0 meaning their karma has been directly modified from the phpMyAdmin which only admin of a forum have access to, it is not possible to receive karma from members without a post. If you neg someone 14 times in the blink of an eye for showing a fellow long-time member support, and for asking some pertinent questions that you didn&#039;t agree with, then you should not be modding as it reveals you do not have the mental capacity to contribute to this forum in that position, it is simply too demanding for your current capabilities. I have noticed you increasing you buddies karma by as much as 30 in 48 hours, so I think we can clearly see you have abused this unlimited karma ability. You&#039;ve admitted you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; long posts b/c your head hurts, you can&#039;t answer tech questions, you are uncomfortable in the Philosophy section, and have just abused the unlimited karma ability to give PrincessHIGH a slab of negs in 30 seconds, and are now giving her a neg every 15 minutes or so in a way that is clearly personal, unprovoked and a clear abuse of moderating. You have really showed us just how &quot;capable&quot; you are at this job and what kind of weak, insipid personality you have IRL. If this is how you use you moderating position, to bully and intimidate well-respected and esteemed members of the forums over something so petty, then simply GTFO the forum and hand over the position to someone else, as there are simply too many people here who would be a real asset here.<br /><br />Now. As to your post that took you a whole day writing. Is this it? Is this what you left the forums for yesterday when, for the first time in a long time, the spam overfilled into ALL sections b/c no one was modding for an extended length of time? We had to bump the spam down until it was taken care of. Okay samesame, what drivel have you come up with this time?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1180300#msg1180300">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 30, 2013, 09:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: PrincessHIGH link=topic=160934.msg1176555#msg1176555<br />date=1369870760</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176125#msg1176125">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 29, 2013, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This response from samesamebutdifferent, has quite frankly, shocked me.

I was away for over a week and you still kept posting your crap. You seem to have a LOT of free time on your hands for a mod.<br /><br />As for this crap about not supporting mods, no one is buying it. My posts, PMs, and initiatives speak for themselves. Princess and myself have both given more support to mods than most. I thought I cleared this up before? You;re not being trolled samesame, you are trolling me and your recent posts give a pretty good indication of how personal and vitriolic you have been over nothing.

My observation is that there is a lot of maturing that needs to take place here. Clicking on a member&#039;s karma 14 times instantly doesn&#039;t say a lot about you. Don;t deny you did this, b/c we have caught you out doing it through your own stupidity. Children neg. Not adults.

You want to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; with PrincessHIGH? You&#039;re kidding right? Are you challenging her? Boy oh boy, samesame, you have a lot to learn so don&#039;t be stupid. Be -- VERY -- careful who you challenge around here. (You live in Australia right? :) ) My advice to you is to get back to your version of &quot;modding&quot; and to stop antagonizing forum members who have served this community well, in more ways than you would know.<br /><br />The person that you have chose to bully and neg 14 times in 30 seconds is a well respected member of Silk Road and its forums. She has given tirelessly of herself and before she became busy with vending -- she&#039;s currently the top bitcoin vendor -- she used to give expert coke reviews from the perspective of someone who thoroughly knows what she is talking about. She also was a familiar face in the newbie section and tech sections -- more than you have done samesame -- and regularly taught PGP encryption both on the PGP Club and via PMs. She has the highest amount of positive karma on the forums and it has not come from posting daily in on the +KARMA thread either -- she hardly posts there. If you think she is anyone to trifle with, and are stupid enough to get into a long grudge match of you negging her every day and basically being immature -- then you may perhaps become familiar with the old adage that what goes around comes around. This is a drug forum. Don&#039;t be stupid by pissing off unknown quantities around here.<br /><br />And stop NEGGING PEOPLE!!

(You often lock threads in this fashion)<br />If my account is banned or deleted, it will be as clear as day you&#039;re a spiteful little man who can&#039;t be trusted to mod without abusing your position.<br />If you respond on this thread again, then it mean you wish to engage in a petty little grudge match with endless trolling and slinging and discredit the OP.<br />If my negs go up suddenly after posting, or even in the same 1-every-15-minute way you have targetted Princess, then you&#039;ll be seen as someone who prefers to troll and abuse the karma function than to mod.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />PS A special mention to samesame who made it easy for me through his own stupidity :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +732/-82<br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately after posting: +732/-97<br /><br />Raz&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +500/-80<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry, did you call me a &quot;little cunt who is negging people?&quot;, I take exception to that, cunts are nice warm places.<br /><br />Just because I am logged in does not mean I am active on the forums so no I was not scouring my mental faculties for hours thinking up that post you referred to, Jesus you really should consider working as a fiction writer, your flights of fantasy are quite incredible.<br /><br />And seeing as you are clearly stalking my movements, reading my posts, looking to see when I log in and out etc can I suggest you get a life instead, its much more fulfilling and enjoyable i can assure you.<br /><br />...

At the time I made this thread, there was a fair amount of unfair negging that had sprung up, also, there was a lot of misinformation and conspiracy theories being spread by someone out of the loop about negging. It needed to be addressed, and I considered myself the best person to moderate an intelligent debate to once and for all look into this issue and fix it permanently. <br /><br />The conspiracy theory that he was trying to sell was that this one person had an, and I quote, &quot;army of shills&quot;, and that every single freaking member that had been negged, was due to this one person with a myriad of shills. Well, it is pretty clear that that is bullshit because it is not even possible given the amount of people affected and the time-frame between negs offset with the sheer volume. PrincessHIGH is a very clear indication of how stupid this theory is. The only way all these people can be negged like this is by either an inhumanly perfectlly coordinated team of neggers with literally hundreds of accounts, with lightning quick communication between them that Tor does not even allow for, or the more plausible explanation of a moderator without the 72 hour restriction, and who said he wanted the karma system abolished.<br /><br />You tell me which is the crazy conspiracy theory, and which isn&#039;t. 14 negs instantly after a post? Only an idiot would say that 14 people negged them at the exact same second. It&#039;s insulting.<br /><br />Besides, he stuffed up last night by negging PrincessHIGH in a way that is not possible for separate accounts for writing something he didn&#039;t like. <br /><br />More than this, he has consistently come back and back and back to troll me and hurl personal abuse, making it impossible to actually talk about negging in an intelligent and investigative way where we can get to the bottom of it. Only someone who is worried about looking into the recent negging sprees would derail a thread to the point he has. Check the number of posts he has made here despite claiming he &quot;didn&#039;t care about it&quot; and observe how much bullcrap and FUD he pulls up, and the way he has made this personal, and make your own conclusions.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

Still, that;s a lot of negs! I remember when MasterBlaster left the thread &quot;Why Can I Not Cum in Your Kids?&quot; or something. It was left up for a very long time before finally being locked. There have also been several rape threads that have been not locked (some of them are still unlocked btw), but InfiniteSource&#039;s thread was locked as soon as StExo asked a question about why his account was being banned. It is hard to get a vendor&#039;s account banned, even with solid proof there have been instances where vendors have been allowed to continue vending despite going into Resolution. So his question was on point. The thread was locked soon after by samesame who gave the reason for locking the thread as &quot;doesn&#039;t need to be left open&quot;. <br /><br />So in answer to your q., some threads are locked and some threads aren&#039;t, but the rules are very movable. Child pornography threads may be accepted here for some time, but most are eventually locked at some point -- eventually. asshole&#039;s thread wasn&#039;t about child porn though, it was about mods editing posts, and that came up organically at some point.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I suppose that it&#039;s possible but I&#039;m not convinced.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Any sort of acceptance or support in regards to child pornography is generally not really well accepted. Just thought you should know , whether you were serious or not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not a fan of child pornography myself. Still, that;s a lot of negs! I remember when MasterBlaster left the thread &quot;Why Can I Not Cum in Your Kids?&quot; or something. It was left up for a very long time before finally being locked. There have also been several rape threads that have been not locked (some of them are still unlocked btw), but InfiniteSource&#039;s thread was locked as soon as StExo asked a question about why his account was being banned. It is hard to get a vendor&#039;s account banned, even with solid proof there have been instances where vendors have been allowed to continue vending despite going into Resolution. So his question was on point. The thread was locked soon after by samesame who gave the reason for locking the thread as &quot;doesn&#039;t need to be left open&quot;. <br /><br />So in answer to your q., some threads are locked and some threads aren&#039;t, but the rules are very movable. Child pornography threads may be accepted here for some time, but most are eventually locked at some point -- eventually. asshole&#039;s thread wasn&#039;t about child porn though, it was about mods editing posts, and that came up organically at some point.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I ended up receiving -18 karma. -11 within 3 minutes. <br /><br />Mods have full discretion when it comes to child pornography so it&#039;s up to them if they wanted to lock masterblaster&#039;s thread about cumming inside children (which they were okay with) or not. I sent it up the chain and received clarification from the man himself.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=1">Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on May 31, 2013, 03:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I give my mods full discretion when it comes to CP.&nbsp; It&#039;s a practical policy designed to avoid attracting new enemies.&nbsp; We have enough as it is.&nbsp; I hope you understand.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now I am going to reiterate the fact that I do not support CP.

Now we know for sure who is going around negging everyone. It is clear as day that you have been giving everyone negs with the ability to hand out negs without a time delay in an effort to stuff the karma system. Ever since you stated that the karma system should be dismantled forum members have been receiving massive amounts of negs that are only possible for a mod to give out. You have tried to blame a hidden &quot;shill army&quot; but I have calculated that the amount of negs given to the amount of people, it is not even possible for this to occur even if someone had over 100 forum accounts. Thank you for stuffing up today samesame and showing as very clearly who is responsible for the recent neg spike on the forums. You should be immediately stripped of your position and apologise to everyone on the forum who you negged, you have made it abundantly clear that you cannot handle responsibility.<br /><br />I have seen the way that you have just bullied PrincessHIGH on this thread and am calling you out for the cowardly little man you are. Before you came online and posted your little rant her karma was +732/-82. In the 30 seconds following your post, she was hit with 10 negs and her karma went to +732/-92. When Lib posted, her negs continued to skyrocket, receiving 1 neg per minute. Princess&#039;s karma is currently +732/-96. Meaning that all this talk of Silk Road forums being a &quot;free&quot; place and that no one is being censored, utter crap. She has received 14 negs in the space of minutes for a post that was faultless, and you have been stupid enough to keep clicking [discourage] to the point that this is clear proof you have been tampering the karma system all along. Symmetry, the new admin, who has never made a post has a karma rating of +2/-0 meaning their karma has been directly modified from the phpMyAdmin which only admin of a forum have access to, it is not possible to receive karma from members without a post. If you neg someone 14 times in the blink of an eye for showing a fellow long-time member support, and for asking some pertinent questions that you didn&#039;t agree with, then you should not be modding as it reveals you do not have the mental capacity to contribute to this forum in that position, it is simply too demanding for your current capabilities. I have noticed you increasing you buddies karma by as much as 30 in 48 hours, so I think we can clearly see you have abused this unlimited karma ability. You&#039;ve admitted you don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; long posts b/c your head hurts, you can&#039;t answer tech questions, you are uncomfortable in the Philosophy section, and have just abused the unlimited karma ability to give PrincessHIGH a slab of negs in 30 seconds, and are now giving her a neg every 15 minutes or so in a way that is clearly personal, unprovoked and a clear abuse of moderating. You have really showed us just how &quot;capable&quot; you are at this job and what kind of weak, insipid personality you have IRL. If this is how you use you moderating position, to bully and intimidate well-respected and esteemed members of the forums over something so petty, then simply GTFO the forum and hand over the position to someone else, as there are simply too many people here who would be a real asset here.<br /><br />Now. As to your post that took you a whole day writing. Is this it? Is this what you left the forums for yesterday when, for the first time in a long time, the spam overfilled into ALL sections b/c no one was modding for an extended length of time? We had to bump the spam down until it was taken care of. Okay samesame, what drivel have you come up with this time?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1180300#msg1180300">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 30, 2013, 09:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176555#msg1176555">Quote from: PrincessHIGH on May 29, 2013, 11:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1176125#msg1176125">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 29, 2013, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This response from samesamebutdifferent, has quite frankly, shocked me.

I was away for over a week and you still kept posting your crap. You seem to have a LOT of free time on your hands for a mod.<br /><br />As for this crap about not supporting mods, no one is buying it. My posts, PMs, and initiatives speak for themselves. Princess and myself have both given more support to mods than most. I thought I cleared this up before? You;re not being trolled samesame, you are trolling me and your recent posts give a pretty good indication of how personal and vitriolic you have been over nothing.

You obviously enjoy coming back here and think this is some kind of a game. Grow up and move out of your parent&#039;s house. My observation is that there is a lot of maturing that needs to take place here. Clicking on a member&#039;s karma 14 times instantly doesn&#039;t say a lot about you. Don;t deny you did this, b/c we have caught you out doing it through your own stupidity. Children neg. Not adults.

You want to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; with PrincessHIGH? You&#039;re kidding right? Are you challenging her? Boy oh boy, samesame, you have a lot to learn so don&#039;t be stupid. Be -- VERY -- careful who you challenge around here. My advice to you is to get back to your version of &quot;modding&quot; and to stop antagonizing forum members who have served this community well, in more ways than you would know.<br /><br />The person that you have chose to bully and neg 14 times in 30 seconds is a well respected member of Silk Road and its forums. She has given tirelessly of herself and before she became busy with vending -- she&#039;s currently the top bitcoin vendor -- she used to give expert coke reviews from the perspective of someone who thoroughly knows what she is talking about. She also was a familiar face in the newbie section and tech sections -- more than you have done samesame -- and regularly taught PGP encryption both on the PGP Club and via PMs. She has the highest amount of positive karma on the forums and it has not come from posting daily in on the +KARMA thread either -- she hardly posts there. If you think she is anyone to trifle with, and are stupid enough to get into a long grudge match of you negging her every day and basically being immature -- then you may perhaps become familiar with the old adage that what goes around comes around. This is a drug forum. Don&#039;t be stupid by pissing off unknown quantities around here.<br /><br />And stop NEGGING PEOPLE!! We now know that you&#039;re the little cunt that has negging everyone on the forums the last week and you need to grow the fuck up.<br /><br />If you lock this thread we&#039;ll know you&#039;ve been outwitted and simply can&#039;t respond. (You often lock threads in this fashion)<br />If my account is banned or deleted, it will be as clear as day you&#039;re a spiteful little man who can&#039;t be trusted to mod without abusing your position.<br />If you respond on this thread again, then it mean you wish to engage in a petty little grudge match with endless trolling and slinging and discredit the OP.<br />If my negs go up suddenly after posting, or even in the same 1-every-15-minute way you have targetted Princess, then you&#039;ll be seen as someone who prefers to troll and abuse the karma function than to mod.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.<br /><br />PS A special mention to samesame who made it easy for me through his own stupidity :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +732/-82<br />PrincessHIGH&#039;s karma immediately after posting: +732/-97<br /><br />Raz&#039;s karma immediately before posting: +500/-80<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m sorry, did you call me a &quot;little cunt who is negging people?&quot;, I take exception to that, cunts are nice warm places.<br /><br />Just because I am logged in does not mean I am active on the forums so no I was not scouring my mental faculties for hours thinking up that post you referred to, Jesus you really should consider working as a fiction writer, your flights of fantasy are quite incredible.<br /><br />And seeing as you are clearly stalking my movements, reading my posts, looking to see when I log in and out etc can I suggest you get a life instead, its much more fulfilling and enjoyable i can assure you.<br /><br />... To PrincessHIGH I have never, not once negged you, whether you want to believe that or not is entirely up to you.<br /><br />Like I said before I would like nothing more than to draw a line under this, I will not however just roll over and be defamed by you Razorspyne, your forum tactics embody all the traits you are projecting in my direction, get a mirror and take a look at yourself.<br /><br />Oh yes and one last thing, yes I am in Australia, what of it? if you have a point (or threat) to make then make it don&#039;t use one of those stupid emoticons you love so much to try and infer you were being lighthearted.<br /><br />Over and out... <br />[/quote]

Did you really think people would fall for that? How many accounts does this shill master have? 400? 500? As for your mental faculties, you just admitted that you didn’t read all the long replies because it made your “head hurt”. And you did neg PrincessHIGH repeatedly from its place on -82 24 hours ago, so you can’t be too bloody clever. In fact, you are very predictable.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1183141#msg1183141">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 31, 2013, 12:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And seeing as you are clearly stalking my movements, reading my posts, looking to see when I log in and out etc can I suggest you get a life instead, its much more fulfilling and enjoyable i can assure you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Is that the best you can come up with? I haven’t gone through your posts, I am familiar with your posts b/c you often come to a thread and leave your 2 cents, and I have seen you trolling members before without saying anything constructive. And are you really that stupid to think that you could neg someone on my thread 14 times in 30 seconds and not be found out? Now tell me who has a life and who doesn’t? You have been coming back to flame on this thread again and again about a topic you said you didn’t give a “horse shit” about, so you must have a lot of time on your hands.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1183141#msg1183141">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 31, 2013, 12:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">... To PrincessHIGH I have never, not once negged you, whether you want to believe that or not is entirely up to you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />I notice you don’t offer any explanation or argument, b/c you have none. Pretty poor response, isn’t it? “whether you want to believe that or not is entirely up to you.” Sorry but that;s what people say when they realise they have lost an argument. I am not convinced by that very small line.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1183141#msg1183141">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 31, 2013, 12:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Like I said before I would like nothing more than to draw a line under this, I will not however just roll over and be defamed by you Razorspyne, your forum tactics embody all the traits you are projecting in my direction, get a mirror and take a look at yourself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />If you really “would like nothing more than to draw a line under this” then why have you constantly come back to this thread to flame and spread misinformation? You were called uout on your unprovoked and very personal trolling of me, and you don’t know how to respond b/c you are not used to dealing with someone intelligent. You didn’t respond to my posts where I picked your arguments apart b/c you simply couldn’t think of something to conteract them. The amount of people you have slung at on this forum, this was going to happen – eventyalluy someone with an education was going to call you out on your bullshit. You did this all to yourself. I am not defaming you samesame. You came on MY thread and started defaming ME. For a mod this is a disgrace as you have clearly made this a very personal slinging match that you seem to want to continue given that you keep coming back to this thread to have one last dig and spread more disinformation. If you really want to let it be like you say, why keep coming back?<br /><br />All I wanted to do was debate the recent negging and discuss an important issue concerning reviewors being negged, but you have derailed it with your nonsense. The more you come back, the more obvious your actions are.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=160934.msg1183141#msg1183141">Quote from: samesamebutdifferent on May 31, 2013, 12:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Oh yes and one last thing, yes I am in Australia, what of it? if you have a point (or threat) to make then make it don&#039;t use one of those stupid emoticons you love so much to try and infer you were being lighthearted.<br /><br />Over and out... <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I thought I covered this? Nobody threatened anyone on here, to state that I did is quite insulting. I can understand YOU threatening someone, b/c of the posts you have made. Why would someone who has devoted all their time to strengthening and solidifying Silk Road threaten another member? The reason you have not listed this “threat” is b/c there is no threat to start with. I covered this in detail so read my post and stop making baseless accusations I have already answered anyway.<br /><br />Thank you though for finally stuffing up samesame and making it really easy to understand where this&nbsp; sudden negging has come from. I am shocked that a moderator has so little self discipline to neg a respected member of the community 14 times for a post you didn’t like. You are very predictable, and now PrincessHIGH knows how you deal with someone who has supported you through thick and thin on the forums. You are very ungrateful for all her help when you were starting out and needed assistance modding, as you needed a lot of help back then, and donations made to you at that time by her. All over a single post you didn’t like. The fact you can bully her like that is indicative of how capable you are as a mod, and quite frankly leads us to wonder if you actually do anything here but troll, flame, spread misinformation, and relentlessly neg a remarkable humanitarian who has done so much for this forum. I almost feel a sense of pity for you, and hope you get the help you need as I have seen a lot from you just this week to realise there is something very wrong with you upstairs. <br /><br />She has done more for this forum than most so leave her alone, or at least have the balls to raise your issue outside the protection of a moderating position. You are a perfect example of how a mod can abuse their position. You negged her. You were caught out doing it through your own stupidity. And given your single defeated line, you now realise how dumb it was to do this. Time to pick a role you are better suited to. A mod abusing their position is not just frowned upon, it is a liability.<br /><br />Also, what is a mod doing coming back again and again and again to flame at the OP? I thought you said you wanted to “leave it be”.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I am locking this thread as it is no longer discussing &quot;The Score On Negging on Silk Road forums&quot;; instead it has devolved into personal attacks and childish insults from all parties and has been sent completely off topic as a result. This is causing a massive rift in this community, setting users against each other and slowly eating away at the bonds that we&#039;ve all built with each other. We&#039;re all on the same damn side here. We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and start directing our vitriol where it is most deserved and most needed.<br /><br />If any of you have an issue with my locking this, you are of course free to PM me about it.<br /><br />Libertas
