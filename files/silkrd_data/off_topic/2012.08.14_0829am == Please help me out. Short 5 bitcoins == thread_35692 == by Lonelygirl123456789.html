				I just gave you 6 bitcoins, in case the value drops, you will still have enough money for that ounce.<br /><br />All I hope is that I can get sex for that. Where are you from?

				oi seagul, I&#039;ll hook up with the entire ounce. but first instead of swooping down on a chip like ur obviously are so use to doing here how u can make ur earn.. swoop this way and gussle down on some of my homeboys. OR.... how&#039;s about ur broke ass put down the yay and get a job. then bring ur diggin ass back to the forum and shout us all 5btc each as apologey for attempting to such a scab.. <br /><br />I guess u should be able to figure out why u lack in receiving kindness here, probly explains the loneliness u openly admit to
