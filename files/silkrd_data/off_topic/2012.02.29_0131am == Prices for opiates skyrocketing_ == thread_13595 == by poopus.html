				I&#039;m a pretty infrequent Silk Road&#039;er, so when I got on today to make a purchase I was surprised to see that most of the vendors I had ordered from in the past were gone, and prices were much higher than usual!&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Anyone else notice something similar?

				With Pharmville out for a week or so, you&#039;re left with the normally high priced sellers. <br /><br />Pharmville should be back on Thursday or Friday.

				I&#039;m not sure about lots of opiate vendors disappearing, but you&#039;re definitely right that prices have skyrocketed lately.<br /><br />It&#039;s a supply/demand thing. If a vendor lists a batch of opiates and finds them snapped up in a day or two, it is human nature to list the next batch at a price that&#039;s a few dollars higher per pill. My sense is that there&#039;s been a very slight correction lately -- crossing the $1 per mg threshold seems to be resulting in a sales slowdown -- but the general trend over the past few months has been for the SR price fpor opiates&nbsp; to increase, both in absolute terms and (especially) relative to prices IRL.

				At the turn of the year with vendor commissions increasing is when I noticed the first bump up. Some vendors are currently way over a $1/gram. One I noticed is about $2/gram but has no volume discount listings.&nbsp; Pharmville is still the cheapest and best of the opiate vendors in this regard. Under or @ the $1/gram threshold with volume discount listings.

				@poop. I sniff #4 and smoke the #3. yea right now there is only dolphan for domestic. but personally, considering the quality and his price, I think he&#039;s a rip off. go with tony or woo3. they are both located in canada and both have insane #4. their packaging is fantastic and has a high chance to get through customs - so I wouldn&#039;t worry about that. I ordered from psilocin - located somewhere in the EU - a few weeks back. and it got to the states with no problem at all in less than a week. if you really, really want domestic, I would wait for PharmerJohn or JohnnyDepp to re-up. I hear they have some of the best tar around. great for smoking.

				@poop, hey if you do opiates more 4 times a week, you already fucked yourself&nbsp; :) especially with anything oxy - with that said, heroin really isn&#039;t all that much different. I mean, it is if you IV it, but if you&#039;re like me and stick with bumping and smoking, the high, in my opinion is really similar to an oxy high. just much, much cheaper and much, much stronger&nbsp; :) but of course, it all depends on the purity, how much you do, what it&#039;s cut with etc. etc.

				Edit: I may have gotten off track and kinda been replying to both the OP and habitat accidentally. So first off, OP if you are not a regular user, then PLEASE reconsider your use of opiates and just appreciate that the prices of opiate are a barrier to your use. Be glad they are higher and prohibitive so you do not become any more dependent. If you are already a regular user then H may be a good option. If not, I would not recommend moving onto heroin! <br /><br />Habitat, I am in the same boat! The docs around here are too afraid to prescribe medicine to people that actually need it. Been a daily user of peer obtained oxycodone for a few years now, started at 50 cents a mg and now up over $1/mg... The thousands in my bank acct have been drained and its either stop using and live with the pain (not an option and actually function) or find a cheaper alternative. And well, that cheaper option is diacetylmorphine surprisingly. <br /><br />OP, if you start with H, to be honest, the most important thing is to set your daily limit and stick to it. Given you will be receiving a bag of powder, instead of already pre-measured doses, you need to keep track of how much you are using or you can easily do more than you realize and quickly increase your tolerance.<br /><br />That being said, I have received one order from wumg (now W007), tony, psilocin and have been very satisfied. You have no idea how great it feels not to blow through a few hundred dollars every week, instead I spend less than 100. Thats 1/3 of the cost I have been spending which is amazing! I have just been using small bumps to take the edge off the pain and keep the sickness at bay. But when I want, I can actually feel something from it too which oxy was losing its magic.<br /><br />Like Habitat said, if you are already using OC daily, you are in wayyy over your head already and switching to heroin is not going to be a major change and your downfall UNLESS you start to IV or abuse the dosing. &lt;SO ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EVER USE IV&gt; Snorting, I have found the effects to be very similar to oxy, except H is slightly more relaxing and sedating and the half-life is a bit shorter, 2-3 hrs for morphine compared with 3-4 for oxy so I find myself wanting that next bump a bit sooner...&nbsp; still find myself to be able to restrain myself and say no, tell myself &quot;you need to wait a couple hours&quot; which I couldnt do easily with oxy. I respect the H much more and still posses the fear I am going to do too much and overdose, but with oxy it was just do as much as I can afford...&nbsp; I was worried I would have the intense desire to just use the H and get high everytime (which I do sometimes) but I am also able to use less just to feel normal. <br /><br />With any opiate you are going to suffer withdrawals, period. Even tramadol. I have seen that there are many personal differences regarding which opiate is worse to detox from, but some find H to be worse than OC, others the other way around. At least with H the half-life is shorter so the withdrawal wont last quite as long. Not like you are switching to methadone and gonna increase your w/d by weeks of hell. <br /><br />Dont take it orally, because you will be wasting 1/3 to 2/3 of the H given the horrible bioavailability. Also, I would not recommend you smoke the dope, I tried it for the first time yesterday after receiving psi&#039;s gear since its #3... and the rush and actual high are much more noticeable and I feel more prone to abuse, plus it wore off more quickly and about 4 hours later I felt much more shitty than I normally ever do and had to snort a bump to mellow back out. It took such a ridiculously small amount though, it was surprising (and I probably wasted much of the smoke not inhaling all given the learning curve) <br /><br />If you are concerned about customs though, I would say you have a greater than 95 percent likelihood of success, so dont worry. W007 and psilocin have extremely clever shipping methods, to the point customs could open the package and still not find the goods. I would definitely go with Tony or wumg though, their H is incredible and both are really nice guys. Both arrived within a week and psi just over a week. <br /><br />Good luck!

				There is a shortage of Opana (oxymorphone) right now and docs don&#039;t like to prescribe hydromorphone cus of the &quot;history&quot; and what ever and so on and so fourth... I haven&#039;t found 1 pharm in town with stock in a pretty big west coast city ;( <br /><br />As for best bio-availability for sure it&#039;s IV but it&#039;s a risk of really getting hooked and also getting infected and all sorts of nasty things.&nbsp; Opiates are actually very safe (for the body), it&#039;s the &quot;drug war&quot; that has tainted it just like everything else.<br /><br />Also there are people who are in real pain and the docs are scared to prescribe because of the busts by feds, etc... Even with people that have serious back injuries, etc, they say &quot;oh you have to live with it&quot; etc... people kill themselves over pain and it&#039;s subjective but /most/ doctors don&#039;t care and just think that everyone are drug addicts... even when they are the ones that prescribe the high strength opiates!

				No problem, I get bored and enjoy talking about my experiences with similar people, especially if someone can find anything useful<br /><br />You will not be disappointed by tony! That is literally one of the best opiates in the world, I havent even been missing the oxy at all. One word of advice, use way less than you think you need. I feel like for each mg of tonys H it is equivalent to at least a mg of oxycodone. Start with much less than that to be safe and work your way up to where you want to be since you dont have any experience with it. Also, if you got the pebbles, be extremely careful cause somehow they are even more potent unbelievably. <br /><br />You will surely have fun, but also be safe please! <br />- miR
