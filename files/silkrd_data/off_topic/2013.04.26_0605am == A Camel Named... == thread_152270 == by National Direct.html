				Everybody knows the green camel that delivers the goods from the Road, but how does a camel manage to remain anonymous, when there are humans that can&#039;t figure out PGP. Those camels have brains under those humps. Slow, steady and calm, that motherfucking camel delivers shit all day and all night, and we don&#039;t even raise a glass, bong, needle, or pipe in it&#039;s honour. Shameful&nbsp; :&#039;(! <br /><br />This thread is where the unidentified camel gets props and some cool names from the people that use his services.<br />It&#039;s in the shipping forum because the camel runs the shipping part of SR! <br /><br />What do you think the camel should be named? should it remain anonymous? Or should we find his private key and get down to the bottom of it. I bet it&#039;s an international vendor.<br /><br /><br />To that, I Raise a glass, shoot smack, and pack a few bong loads... To the camel!<br /><br /><br />My name suggestion: Camelidless [cam-el-id-liss], the Goddess of Anonymity and Protector of ancient encrypted Hieroglyphs (needs protection cuz it&#039;s only 16-bit encryption) :P But that name sucks, so post your ideas here!

				Actually, that&#039;s a really cute idea.&nbsp; I support that.&nbsp; The fucking thing&#039;s basically a mascot, why doesn&#039;t it have a name?<br /><br />... but yeah, I have no idea why this is in the shipping section... or really wtf you&#039;re saying for half your post, to be totally honest.&nbsp; Still, kudos and all :)

				haha I put it in the shipping section first off to get attention from people wondering why it&#039;s here, and secondly because it reresents the old method of delivery on the real silk road. Those camels can carry half a ton of your favorite shit, and have some waterskins to wash it down.<br /><br />If any mods feel this post to be out of place please don&#039;t delete it and move it to off-topic&nbsp; ;)

				Hmm it;s hard thinking of any great names combining camel and anonymity/obscurity. =\<br /><br />I guess a camel&#039;s humps could represent bell curves on a avg BTC trade value over a reasonable period.<br />

				if the camel is looking to remain anonymous I&#039;m sure it would rather not have it&#039;s name divulged.<br /><br />That being said:<br />- John/Jane Do(p)e<br />- REDACTED<br />- Pseudo Nym<br />- The Defendant<br />I&#039;m too high for this... or actually no, I&#039;m not high enough!

				Is this like joe the camel from Camel smokes?<br /><br />The camel needs a skull and crossbones on his pack, or a balaclava on its head .&nbsp; Or maybe just sunglasses.&nbsp; Either way, that camel needs some personality.&nbsp; I thought it an animated gif one night. It was walking across the page&nbsp; &nbsp;Haha <br /><br />He looks more like a Hector.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lets get that friggin camel smiling. <br /><br />
