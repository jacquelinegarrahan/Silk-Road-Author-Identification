				I have no idea Bob.<br /><br />They look like nice green plants to me :)<br /><br />--<br />Some thoughts:<br /><br /><br />If these are drugs, I think you could grow several hectares of them in the countryside in the open no problem. Obviously you&#039;ll have to get your camouflage thought out really well. It&#039;s a completely different ball game to a hydroponic weed grow op that&#039;s for sure. Closed secrets are difficult to keep in the country unless they take up very little space.<br /><br />I would suggest finding an extremely similar plant to this one, and then growing a wide swath of it at the circumference to your main crop. Alternatively you could grow the two plants in alternating rows which is a standard agricultural practice. Even if other farmer&#039;s spot that it&#039;s not the same crop as the interior one, they wouldn&#039;t be that suspicious of you because this is actually a fairly common practice in agronomy e.g. some plants are toxic to specific pests, so you can make a &#039;firewall&#039; for your plants which are your main crop by using other ones defensively. This is very common with farmers who dislike using, or can&#039;t afford pesticides. e.g. the organic farmers.<br /><br />Just in case though, you&#039;ll also need a reason to be growing that for non drug related properties (and you might as well put the &#039;defense/camo&#039; crop up for sale too). I don&#039;t know what but you can figure out the details I&#039;m sure, there&#039;s plenty of reasons to be growing hemp-like plants.<br /><br />Believe it or not, it is very common for farmers to use plastic to give something of a greenhouse affect to rows of crops. I forget the name for this, but there will be photos on the internet of it, so if this plant is a thermophile then this would be a totally reasonable non suspect thing to be doing. <br /><br />Good excuses for growing either crop (if farmer&#039;s ask) could be biodiesel / biomass stuff. A lot of farmers are experimenting in this area generally, so they are doing a lot of exotic grows in comparison to standard food/textile related crops.<br /><br />Your biggest dangers would be regulators like farming inspectors e.g. looking for farmers tax dodging, which is common, and geek farmers who are big into new exotic uses of plants who could see past your &#039;camo&#039;.<br /><br />You will eventually require farmer friends for practical reasons such as borrowing machinery (it&#039;s hella expensive, heads into the millions of dollars easily). Also a lot of farmers are good people and will mind their own business even if they think somethings weird, so long as they understand you&#039;re a good guy willing to help them out occasionally when there is a need (e.g. you need all the help you can get at harvest times, so this is a good time to make allies). It is also important not to appear wealthy. They are lots of wealthy farmers, but none of them like flashy people it gives them bad vibes.<br /><br />Country people are excellent spies! They will tip you off right away if people are snooping around your equipment or farm or crop fields. In the country neighbors look out for each other (so give them your phone numbers), but beware pitching your crop on &#039;sacred land&#039;. If you start buying up big chunks of land all of a sudden, or if you buy land in the wrong place, then you could fall foul of local politics very fast. Make friends first, figure out the lay of the land, ask for advice, give help liberally, and your operational security will be bulletproof. Farmers are not friends of the government and never really will be because they are natural capitalists.<br /><br />Anyway good luck with your idea. If this works, you could get rich very fast indeed, and very quickly your main problems turn from making money, to finding ways to get it back into the system. This is the kind of thing I keep banging on about the concept of &#039;vertical integrated&#039; business strategies.<br /><br />Protip: You can now get a bank loan, maybe even government money for growing drugs. Lulz! ;D

				Funny, I&#039;ve chewed the coca leaf in South America specifically for altitude sickness. It&#039;s not illegal in Bolivia or Peru. What I found was a drug comparable to .. weak coffee. It&#039;s nothing, if not harmless on it&#039;s own. In fact I still had the dull thud of a headache as I chewed the leaves no matter how much mastication. <br /><br />Anyway, I don&#039;t mean to highjack this thread - So FarmerBob, is it or isn&#039;t it?

				It&#039;s Coca. But Coca looks quite a bit like Oleander, a highly toxic decorative shrub. I think anyone with basic plant knowledge would assume that it was Oleander, and stay away. <br /><br />Alternatively, you could plant a couple of Oleander bushes around the plants to make everything blend in together.

				Would you be selling leaves or seeds. My fiance collects and grows a small amount of mystical and drug related plants (both medical and recreational). We dont really mess with most of them, it&#039;s just a hobby of hers. I would LOVE to be able to gift her a coca plant for christmas. I&#039;ve also been curious about coca tea for awhile as I hate caffeine.

				Thanks for all of the info Farmerbob!<br /><br />If you ever get viable seeds off of these, please let me know. I&#039;d really like to try this as a greenhouse plant, and a cup of coca tea sounds a lot&nbsp; more interesting than a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Edit: Word choice.
