				Im bringing drugs to my senior trip too man so no worries. Only thing is my seniors are actually senior citizens. I like to get my grandpa all fucked up. He was an old hippy growing up in the sixtys and seventys and tripping on LSD and every drug under the sun. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree, huh? Nice to bring him some good shit and get him to tell me his stories that he can still remember from his younger tripped out life. The stories always seem to change with each trip so im starting to think hes just a great bullshit artist. Either way it still makes for a fun time!

				Goddamn, I&#039;m not gonna post the details because I&#039;m currently feeling paranoid as hell but I did some extremely stupid shit last night, I was so goddamn fucked up I was basically just hovering over myself watching it happen.

I just had what could have been the most enlightening and positive experiences of my life and all I have to show for it is embarrassment<br /><br />If you guys order the malabar bars do not fucking eat more than 1/4 of it at once without a sitter<br /><br /><br />Senior trip?
