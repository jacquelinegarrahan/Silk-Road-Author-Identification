				I just started to buy bulks and i would like to have some advice on how to stash/hide pounds of weed safely away from my house.<br /><br />I am renting a room nearby college and there are lots of tenants. i was initially thinking to visit a nearby trail. dig the ground where ppl wouldn&#039;t go. place a airtight &amp; waterproof box.<br /><br />I am thinking to put ounces of weeds in plastic bags into mason jars then put it in the icebox. it seems lots of hassles but i can take extra security while i dont waste weeds into garabage due to molds.. maybe i could get a home vac seal and put it in the mason jar and so on..<br /><br />please share any good idea to hide weed away from the house you live in.<br /><br />Thanks

				Rent a PO box with a fake ID. For a large one that fits kilos it will cost about $150 a year. Make sure its a mom and pop type with 24 hour PO box access. They will get suspicious if your putting stuff in your box well their working their. Also make sure your never followed their.

				I am skeptical about burying your weed- It would seem to me too big a hassle to have to dig up and unpack any properly stored jars, and properly stored they would have to be to prevent bacteria and mold from accumulating. Perhaps hiding your stash in a foreclosed home or renting storage would be a better option.

				Closer to your person is better as far as the wondering, is some animal, human or other at it, the anxiety of having it at home recedes as time&nbsp; goes on well. If you are in a new ish house you could dummy up a pvc plubming return, not that hard to do and does&#039;nt have to look too good cause no one wants that shit man!
