				Hi guys,<br /><br />I am throwing this out there as an idea...<br /><br />I&#039;m looking to become a supplier. Not some street dealer but top tier. I am thinking of planning a trip to the Andes Mountains in South America. I am either hoping I&#039;ll meet a connect there, or start out harvesting the leaves of the Erythroxylum (coca) bush and take it from there.<br /><br />Thoughts, feelings, any feedback?

				Thanks for the replies. The capital will not be an issue. I just want to know if you think it is more feasible to bring back the leafs and process it here in the states or not. Also if any of you are familiar with how they extract, and press it. That would be of value.

				You don&#039;t want to import tons of coca leaves, lol.<br /><br />It takes ~300 grams of leaves to get 1 gram of cocaine. <br /><br />And good luck... Try not to get killed.

				Doesn&#039;t sound very feasible to process the drugs in the US. You&#039;ll probably be caught before you have your first K to sell.<br /><br />Get in the game, try to get the right connections. Watch a few drug themed movies. If they&#039;re not helpful, they&#039;ll at least be entertaining.

I, personally, suggest that you import the leaves yourself. Would be nice to see what cocaine looks like, when the extraction is handled by... y&#039;know, someone that isn&#039;t a cartel-threatened farmer, or the like.

				Farmers make pasta, paste, some shit not quite ready for a party in my nose.<br /><br />&quot;Cartels&quot; turn the paste into hydrochloric and leave behind some shit for the local markets called oxidado/basuco/base in spanish.<br /><br />Farmers make fuck all.&nbsp; Guys that handle processing from paste into hcl make fuck all.&nbsp; Most people make fuck all in comparison with potential profits.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most farmers are under contract of a sort... you don&#039;t want to fuck with their bosses.... seriously... I don&#039;t mean any offense but your idea is pretty dangerous, stupid in fact.<br /><br />In Colombia you&#039;ll need to deal with/steer clear of the FARC and Paramilitaries, FARC would be happy to kidnap you for a ransom despite recent renunciations of kidnapping as a tactic... Paramilitaries are not much better....<br /><br />Peru also has a dodgy non governmental organization that controls a good part of coca producing territory, they called Shining Path or Sendero Luminoso, don&#039;t believe the puff press pieces written by kids in washington, they are still active and dangerous.<br /><br />Bolivia has a large area of production that isn&#039;t controlled by dodgy gangs/whatever you want to call them.&nbsp; You&#039;re more likely to find coca leaves here and they are completely legal for traditional use (chewing not processing into snortable)&nbsp; Locals won&#039;t like what your planning to do though and those indigenas have a tendency to burn people they don&#039;t like-.<br /><br />Ecuador, my home, has limited production and grey usage of coca leaves for traditional chewing.<br /><br />I am biased but I would recommend Ecuador because we don&#039;t have so much violence associated with the business, most locals are fairly innocent (Colombians generally are more on to things), but the benefits of corruptable police and cheap coke exist in all of the andes.<br /><br />It has been mentioned that you shouldn&#039;t be looking at leaves, it would be a better idea if you came looking to buy paste and turning it into hcl, or even just buying hcl cheap and exporting....<br /><br />¿Hablas Español? Mas o menos.... ya tienes una idea pero nada mas.... <br /><br />Seriously it&#039;s a bad idea.<br /><br />Cocaine, ready for consumption, sells for maximum $10 a gram on the street in developed Andean cities and buying in bulk you can source kilos for under $2000 if you know what you are doing.&nbsp; There is a lot of money to be made.&nbsp; The RISK is very high however.&nbsp; Buying small quantities in tourist zones of the cities is quite possible, you&#039;re going to get ripped off and maybe delt some oxidado/cut bs but it is possible. <br /><br />However scoring large quantities of decent quality cocaine or large quantities of coca leaves is not a sensible option without many many many things, least of all an ability to speak Spanish, some trustworthy connections and a lot of luck....<br /><br />Okay assuming you speak a bit of Spanish what do you need to do?&nbsp; Move to the Andes for a year, learn local lingo, make friends, be very sociable, keep your eye out for a potential opportunity.&nbsp; Find some locals who buy for friends and buy through them, build up a relationship and see how far up the chain you can get.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t dumb enough to get arrested and spend at least 6 months hanging out with the &quot;underworld&quot; you should be able to make some pretty sweet connections.<br /><br />You need to learn a couple of phrases when going to S. America but you need a lot more to try and do business well.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; &quot;No me trates como gringo&quot; Don&#039;t treat me like an american/foreigner.&nbsp; 2. &quot;No soy DEA&quot; (pronounced DAY-AH) I&#039;m not DEA.&nbsp; &nbsp;and most importantly &quot;Pago una multa&quot; I pay a fine, say that to the cops when you get caught doing some shit and offer some cash, it means &quot;I pay a fine&quot; and is the best way to offer a bribe without actually offering a bribe (you might get arrested for offering bribes if you are unlucky enough to get a straight cop).<br /><br />Airport LEO and basically everyone is corruptable but apart from your poor cop on his beat most people need some arrangement.&nbsp; Get yourself a good lawyer, dunno about the rest of the Andes but here in Ecuador you can talk to your lawyer about future illegal plans with no problem.<br /><br />Seriously, it is a bad idea....&nbsp; <br /><br />Some things you should avoid would be anyone not from the country you are in, telling coca farmers that you want to make cocaine (unless you&#039;ve been introduced on the basis that they know what the story is) and getting busted without a good wad of cash and a good lawyer.<br /><br />S. America is amazing, cocaine is very cheap and LE is very corruptable but if you get caught with large quantities and go through any processing (ie you don&#039;t/can&#039;t pay them off on site) well if you are a foreigner it might well make the news and then you could be stuck in jail for at least a few months.<br /><br />Price guide: $1000-3000 a key.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $20-500 bribe a low level police officer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $10,000 get out of jail (still going to be a wanted person)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $100,000 bribe the supreme court (home free)<br /><br />Advice:&nbsp; Rethink, realize it&#039;s not a good idea, if you&#039;re still determined learn some more Spanish, take your time, think about the whole movement.

				Before I go to bed,<br /><br />DID I MENTION IT IS A BAD IDEA!<br /><br />If you want some more random useless info please respond.<br /><br />As for anyone looking just to score a g or two in the andes, just get yourself to the &quot;zona rosa&quot; and walk around for a bit and you will spot some old school hippies or punks, chat with them, be prepared to get ripped off and repeat until you find some one.<br /><br />Learn some español, por dios!

				Aside from what bananatinpots said, you don&#039;t want to process/can&#039;t process any coke here in the states. South America is the capital of this product for a reason, their agriculture situation is JUST right.
