				Wow man that&#039;s not right. I was 13 I think and trying to act cool around the older kids. Some guy hands me a hash joint and I honestly felt NOTHING from it at all. The next time I smoked was when I was 16 at a party but didnt do it very often. Really got into it between the age of 18-21, had a break and now im back and love it more than ever!<br /><br />Should say the only bad trip Ive ever had was when I smoked far too much and watched Saw III. I had to go to bed early that night. I freaked out badly.

				The first time I smoked weed, I was 13 and I was with my best friend and this boy I hate, lol! I was freaking the fuck out. I got really stoned, but I kept yelling at my best friend to save me because I kept &quot;falling asleep&quot; and waking up somewhere else LOL. The boy that I hate was trying to take advantage of me, but luckily that was one thing my best friend COULD save me from, lol. And, even though I was being a spaz, I was definitely still aware that I hated him and that his jedi mind tricks wouldn&#039;t work on me. I remember walking around the house, basically just tripping out about how &quot;fast&quot; i was moving or rather, how fast everything was moving around me, and freaking out until my friends and I went for a walk and I calmed down, lol.<br /><br />Needless to say, I&#039;ve never experienced the same effect since that time, which I am thankful for, LOL!

				3 years ago :)<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke and I do not care for tabacco. I would either smoke it pure or eating it, mainly. I ate it before I smoked it.<br /><br />It was a delicious cookie I made out of some hash my friend sold to me :)

				of course i do, who wouldnt! it was a few days before my 14th birthday, a mate got some compressed green off a guy in school (we had been trying to get hold of some for seemingly ages but hadnt expected green, it was all about cheap rez in them days, at least at my school) so that night we decided to smoke it, we were pretty clueless to be honest, just took half what we had and rolled it up in a single rizla, smoked it and seemingly nothing, so we smoked the other half,and began complaining that it was fake and a waste of money, then it hit and it was good (why it took so long to kick in im not sure) a few mins later my friend ran off to throw up, after a while i started feeling a little bit dodgy myself and headed to the toilet where i thought id puke, i didnt though, i just fell dead asleep buckled over the bog bowl and woke up at about 4am with my face in the crapper! the things you do when youre young!

				Oh I&#039;ll never forget my first time, I sure went balls to the wall.&nbsp; I was 14 and me and my buddy smoked a joint and then as soon as we finished we dropped some LSD.&nbsp; Just as the high was coming down the LSD started kicking in.&nbsp; We listened to the doors album and everytime I hear people are strange I can&#039;t help but think about that night.&nbsp; Also Jammed on the guitar and got into a fight with a snickers bar.&nbsp; Oh the good old days.

				I sure do. I was 18 (just started college) and I went to a park to play frisbee with a friend of mine from work. He pulled out his dugout and we proceeded to toke it up. I didn&#039;t feel it very much at first but he made me keep smoking til I was good and stoned. Then he made me play frisbee some more. LOL that was the clumsiest, most uncoordinated game of frisbee ever! Good times...

				I first smoked mersh when I was 14 and got wayyyyy paranoid! I could tell everyone knew we were high, three 14 years olds buying hot dogs at a gas station with glazed over eyes, fumbling with money to pay.&nbsp; My mom came and picked me up about 2 hours later where I instantly fell asleep until dinner was ready.&nbsp; Best sleep I ever had.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t get into it much until I discovered good bud in college

				First time was last century.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was around 20 or 21 years old I believe.<br /><br />I thought the world would come down, it was a heavy trip.&nbsp; I drank milk thinking it would go away.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After that I got used to it and now it&#039;s just fine.<br /><br />Recently I tried salvia for the first time, and the effects were very much the same, very trippy.<br />

				lol.&nbsp; This brings back so many memories reading you guys.<br /><br />First time I was thirteen.&nbsp; My family are all farmers so we have a multi-decade history of cultivating outdoor herb for our personal use.<br /><br />However, my cousin&#039;s best friend had just flown back from vancouver and he had some kind of kush, I think it was Afghani.&nbsp; I had never smoked before, and of course being a true Canadian we went right for the buckets.&nbsp; I had three hits, full full hits that I pulled so much I could feel my rib-cage pushing right out.&nbsp; Hacking and coughing.<br /><br />It wasn&#039;t long until the high kicked in though.&nbsp; And holy mother fuck.&nbsp; I had a massive body high AND head high where it felt like my head and body were detatched, I zoned in on everything at once.&nbsp; Eventually I tried taking so much in I had to just sit there with a beer and stare at the wall becasue just hearing people talk caught my concentration so much.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t smoke again until I was 16, literally the day after I got my drivers&#039; license and could drive around by myself (just bought an 88 Honda lol).&nbsp; One of my friends thought we should celebrate it, so we decided to take some mushrooms.&nbsp; They weren&#039;t cyans (I didn&#039;t even know they existed at the time), but I probably had about 1/8.&nbsp; Then he pulls out a joint and we smoke that. THEN he pulls out a six-pack of beer cans as I&#039;m pulling onto the highway at 11 at night and cracks two open.<br /><br />I have not combined weed and mushrooms until this day, for the simple reason that I got an insane head high, and every time we would get up to about 60mph I would suddenly see sparks flying over the hood of the car and it would look like the car was literally trying to drive INTO the road.&nbsp; So I would be screaming at the top of my lungs because it looks like we are trying to drive through the fucking earth to Sibera, my friend is laughing his face off.<br /><br />Took us about ten minutes to get to the next exit, which was 2 miles away.&nbsp; Thank god there were no cops around lol.

				First time I smoke weed I was fourteen, I was in the woods with a bunch of friends and one of them pulled out this little piece that was disguised as a tube of lipstick. I took a few hits and felt nothing, was very disappointed. Tried it again a few weeks later with the same people except this time we built a gravity bong and drank a decent amount of vodka beforehand. Don&#039;t remember much of that night but one of my friends passed out and puked all over himself so a friend and I dragged him half a mile to a cabin nearby where he slept it off. Good times!

				Tried it at 18 and it was the first time I ever smoked anything; of course I felt nothing. It took me three more sessions to get high and I&#039;ve loved it ever since. I still have never tried tobacco (I&#039;m 22) and don&#039;t plan on it.

				I was 14 so that was 17 years ago. Enter the 36 chambers was blowing up my friends mom&#039;s minivan. I was with my best friend and some other guys from school sitting drinking at an apartment. We went to this dude&#039;s jeep and they pulled out a bullet pipe. I was in the backseat and by the time the pipe got back there it was hot as hell and close to empty. I got like one good hit but didn&#039;t really get high to speak of. Later that night I bought a quarter sack of swag. Back in 94 in my south central state of the us weed was commercial but commercial was actually good and fluffy back then kind of like mid-grade and really cheap. <br /><br />Later that night my good friends and I took a joint to the local school yard under a covered awning and blazed it. I got high as hell. I was hooked. I smoked every weekend from then out and some weekdays. By college it turned everyday. Fast forward and I&#039;m 31 having smoked pretty much every day for the last 10 years. That anecdote kind of turning depressing sorry about that.

				i remember it like it was yesterday.<br />I had given a friend 10 bucks on the last day of school freshman year with the promise i would see hime the next day.&nbsp; Well i didn&#039;t see him until the first day back after vacation.&nbsp; And guess what. he had my weed with a little extra. <br />I was happy/mad.<br />I had a few friends over after school that day (of course).. we smoked it all, got very high and proceeded to lounge around on rafts in the pool listening to the birds. it was amazing if I remember correctly.<br />I also remember falling asleep after everyone left only to have my father wake me up because it was time for dinner.<br />The second i got out of bed he looks at me and says&quot;you&#039;re on drugs aren&#039;t you?&quot;<br />Uh, gee no dad just really tired ;)<br />He didn&#039;t buy it needless to say.<br />Anyhow that&#039;s how i remember my first time high. It was incredible.

				I remember the first time I smoked. I was 18 and had never even smoked a cigarette. Took a few bong hits in my friends shed, but didn&#039;t really get high. It&#039;s almost like my brain had to learn how to get high or be sensitized to the weed. The first time I really experienced pot was a few months later when visiting my friend at college. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never been that high since. It felt like I was floating when the elevator moved down and the corner store sandwich was the best food I&#039;d ever had. I couldn&#039;t even remember where I parked my car.

				I used a bubbler my first time, and I didn&#039;t really understand how the process worked, so I didn&#039;t get that high. I had trouble concentrating and I felt pretty mellow, but I was not nearly as blasted away as most people who smoke for the first time.

				My first and only time smoking weed was in a coffee shop in Amsterdam with my sister in law. We both live in different countries and met there to try a coffee shop, visit the Anne Frank house etc. Below is what happened:-<br />1. Strong weed<br />2. Paranoid as hell<br />3. Time slowed down to almost a halt<br />4. Got into taxi afterwards and thought we were being abducted<br />5. Ran down street and flagged down some other cab frantically<br />6. Conscious life decision&nbsp; to stick to the soft drugs ie. Coke and Mdma in future :D
