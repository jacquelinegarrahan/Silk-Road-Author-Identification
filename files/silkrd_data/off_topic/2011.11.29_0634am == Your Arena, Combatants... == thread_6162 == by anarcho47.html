				Oh, I made that up? You mean you never apologized to microRNA, a potential customer, for mistaking him for qgdg, another potential customer whom you referred to as stupid? If you wanna be in denial that&#039;s fine with me. The people who read that thread while it was still up know the deal.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5446.msg52534#msg52534<br /><br />At first, I thought your deals in that thread might&#039;ve been worthwhile, but not after seeing your lack of people skills. I&#039;m glad to be giving my money to a well-respected and communicable seller in anarcho, and I know for the future who to avoid. These forums have definitely been helpful to me in weeding out the losers.

A triple vacuum seal crushes weed beyond what can be sold to a dispensary - that&#039;s just a fact. Maybe you and your friends are cool with it, but you can&#039;t tell me that a vacuum seal doesn&#039;t crush weed - there&#039;s no air left in the package. If it doesn&#039;t smash into a brick, then that means its just fluffy, non-resinous weed. Either way, not as good as my shit.<br /><br />It&#039;s really just common sense. Cops are going to buy from vendors. They&#039;re not going to leave good feedback for the people they&#039;re trying to bust. If a vendor hasn&#039;t had a cop steal a package (and hide DCN), then you have to figure they have SOME kind of special pass, either from cop buyers, or from the site itself.<br /><br />Look, I KNOW this and wouldn&#039;t be raising a stick about it, but the reactions are what really gives people away. I exposed williamgates and Diss0lve and have them totally busted. Fuck, williamgates changed his feedback 3 times (from 5 to 1 to 5 and back to 1) - people KNOW he&#039;s a scammer, yet assholes like the ones I named are saying it just my bad service, even though they know I got scammed.<br /><br />WHEN PEOPLE START ATTACKING YOU FOR RAISING SUSPICIONS, IT JUST CONFIRMS THE SUSPICIONS.

If you brought that logic to a psychiatrist they would tell you that you&#039;re a delusional paranoid. Just saying man, I&#039;ve been to my fair share of psychatrist and taken courses in mental health that I am able to recognize mental health quandaries when I see them. I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re suspicions are wrong, I am saying that you&#039;re in the wrong for assuming someone is confirming your suspicion by arguing against it.<br /><br />Anyways, as for the bud, the vac sealed bud may &#039;crush&#039; the bud, from it&#039;s fluffy state, but the value is not degraded in the slightest. I have gotten OUNCES of BEAUTIFUL bud from vendors in california and other dispensary states that were triple vaccum sealed and it maintained their beauty.<br /><br />Based on the logic you&#039;re saying about crushed bud being worthless, are you also insinuating the naturally dense, non-fluffy bud is worthless? This is exactly what I mean. The bud after it is vac sealed is little difference than very dense nugs. INFACT, I like the bud better after it&#039;s been vaccum sealed for one primary reason:<br /><br />Bud that has not been cured and dried well enough has leaves poking out in every direction, and has an excessively fluffy look to it. Bud that has been in vac sealed bags on the other hand, has it&#039;s leaves nice and tightly secured to the overall shape of the bud, giving it a look of almost perfection, as if it has been dried and cured properly. <br /><br />I have been around alot of bud in my life, I have participated in enough grows and seen bud from enough parts of the world through my travels, that has been vac sealed and bud that has never been vac sealed. I have experience with bud practically all 6 major continents and several areas spanning throughout each of them. I consider myself an expert, while some may find this arrogant, I feel my experiences and travels speak for their self. My humble opinion is, if you think vac sealed bud is ruined, or worthless, then you haven&#039;t been around enough varieties of high quality bud in your life. Even if you live in a dispensary state, and seen all the buds there, that doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re looking at the best bud possible. There is no &#039;set&#039; perfect standard for the best bud. There are different types, with different appearances, different smokes, different highs, etc, that are all extremely dank. <br /><br />This discussion reminds me of this one guy I smoked some very high quality pure indica strain with, and he said that it wasn&#039;t good enough because his idea of a high if a strong sativa. Cannabis is a plant, a product of evolution, and an extremely diverse species, what I would say is the most diverse plant on the face of the earth because of humans willfully crossing it and trying to make new strains. <br /><br />You can have your opinion and believe the bud is what you think it is, but the majorities opinion on it speaks for itself. I have my opinion on it, and I take my opinion for what it is because I have been around bud my entire life from all different parts of the world. <br /><br /><br />~~~Also, 1 side note. Bud is slightly compressed when first removed from a vac sealed bag, but after it is out of the bag and exposed to the air for a bit, it regains a good amount of it&#039;s shape and fluffyness. Vac sealing bud in a bag does not destroy the integreity of the plants cellular structures. Cannabis is a very durable plant and it&#039;s plant cell walls are very strong. We&#039;re not talking dandylions here.

				Thanks A47 for moving this crap out of the cannabis review section.<br /><br />1st off you will notice not too many vendors chiming in.<br />Kinda of an unwritten code not to be dissing each other.<br />2nd you ever buy off Rocker? If not STFU.<br /><br />As a vendor you are finished, you did to yourself.<br />We don&#039;t trust you.<br /><br />Last as A47 has pointed out before (nicely). I admit I play favorites.<br />Don&#039;t like it? Too bad.<br />Nothing wrong with defending good vendors, and buyers who treat me well.<br /><br />The only reason I came to Rocker&#039;s rescue is;<br />She knows she doesn&#039;t have to, her loyal customers respect and love her.<br />Same for LTTM, ROOK, A47, MR OUID, Lexsadie, and on, and on.<br />You attack our favorite vendors we attack back.<br /><br />I read Mr Dank&#039;s SR reviews, I see a vendor who accuses instead of compromises.<br />Blames everyone for bad business, except himself.<br />Can&#039;t deliver on time.<br />Can&#039;t ship properly.<br />Then I read his posts, this guy needs some Valium.<br />Hell he was offering to give it away, and still NO sales.<br /><br />With anonymity comes these relentless troll attacks.<br />Vendors shouldn&#039;t troll it&#039;s very bad for business.<br />You have killed yours.<br />

That shows their true colors and is just deductive reasoning. <br /><br />Then you have the balls to say I&#039;m delusional and paranoid? I say Fuck you, asshole! THAT makes you sound like one of them. Are you honestly saying that cops wouldn&#039;t use every resource at their disposal to infiltrate and control this site?? are you really that naive??

I didn&#039;t say you were delusional and paranoid; which makes me think you can&#039;t read. I didn&#039;t say the logical falacy existed in pointing out someone protest to much. I said the logical falacy exist in the idea that just because someone protest against your idea, then that confirms your suspicions of them being a cop. Thinking they are a cop because they protest against your idea is a logical fallacy and is completely rediculous. Now you have my seriously thinking you are unable to read, or unable to interpret language correctly so I am just going to stop responding to you. <br /><br />Seriously, I have been backing you up on almost every thread you post and then you go and misread what I say and say &quot;Fuck you&quot; to me? I came up with the idea of the new system to help stop scammers and better label trusted buyers and vendors based on your idea, with helping YOU out in mind. So thanks a lot bro. I don&#039;t need to design this system to help out the SR. I have reliable connects on here as it is and I have no need for a new system. I was thinking of other vendors, like yourself when I had the idea.<br /><br />Btw dude, I live right next to a MMJ state which I have family in and visit frequently. I have seen bud fresh from dispensaries, I am aware of what it looks like. Yet, you&#039;re going to tell me I have low standards for weed? Dude, I&#039;ve probably been smoking longer than you&#039;ve been alive, and probably been growing longer than you&#039;ve been smoking. Don&#039;t tell me I have low standards for weed. I am highly confident in what I am talking about. <br /><br />Also, I am not naive in thinking cops can&#039;t bust anyone. Cops may be able to bend the law but they can&#039;t break it completely. They can&#039;t just sell you drugs, or bust you by selling drugs, or bust you by sending drugs to your address. There&#039;s too many legal precedences in place that hinder them and it puts them in a very very tight position. COPS CAN GO TO PRISON TOO YAKNOW. They may be able to bend the law but when they cross the line and break it by doing something stupid, they&#039;re people too. They can be sued, they can be taken to court, a lawyer can have them put away. It&#039;s not being naive, it&#039;s called not being overely paranoid and being secure in the fact that I know what the laws are and I know the powers that a good lawyer can put to use. It&#039;s easy to find loopholes and get around laws in this system than you think, you just have to have your eye open and know the laws.<br /><br />People are too afraid of cops. Cops play power games, especially with their apperances. They are not gods, they are not super humans. In my eyes cops are just licensed gangs funded by the government. They think like everyday people, and probably are only of average intelligence(this is why they are cops and not something better). People get so overwhelmed with anxiety about them that they forget that most of them are average humans with family, with average brains, and average thinking abilities, just a little bit of official training and federal funding.

				Lol you got me. You must be god. I obviously sound like a cop don&#039;t I? How&#039;d you know I&#039;m not older than you? You must also know I&#039;m 3 years old right then?<br /><br />I&#039;m such a total pig, I roll around in the mud, the ladies love me. I&#039;m a cop and I move pounds of weed and I come up with systems to help eradicate scammers and increase the functionality on the silk road and prevent scams. That&#039;s perfect logic bro. I must be a cop! You&#039;re a genius detective! You should go become a detective, you could make big money!<br /><br />(If you believe that ^ then you need to take a step back because your paranoia is getting the best of you)<br /><br />Lol seriously, at this point, I can&#039;t tell if you&#039;re a cop that intentionally trolling every chance he gets, or just some drug user with a serious mental problem, or just a fucking idiot. It&#039;s one of the three and I&#039;m not the only one who thinks so, you&#039;ve proved it beyond a reasonable doubt. I know that my assumptions are right about your state of mind because I can promise you that I can predict exactly what you&#039;re going to say because your patterns for responding to my words are nearly identical in each message.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t backed you lol? I came up with the system primarily because of all your post on the forums, it got me thinking, and I genuinely wanted to help you out. But now I don&#039;t give a shit really because you&#039;re too blind, or too high to see that. I came up with that system to help out new vendors, and just good vendors in general, and people who are serious about doing long term business on the SR and building up forever increasing levels of credibility as a buyer or vendor. <br /><br />Also, the fact that you think vaccum sealing weed is &#039;low standards&#039; proves the point that you just haven&#039;t been around enough. <br />Or maybe it&#039;s like the man with the multi million dollar diamond studded shirt thinks buying a $5000 diamond ring is &quot;low standards&quot;. Lmao. <br /><br /><br />Something is wrong with your reasoning it seems so I&#039;m going to stop trying to prove points to you. If you think I&#039;m deluded for believing this, then I guess all the multitudes of other people on the forums are deluded to. I tried to be your friend and have your back but for some reason you insist on creating enemies from people who had nothing but good intentions toward you. Again, if you think this is a lie or misconception on my part, then ask anyone who has seen the threads. I&#039;m done.<br /><br />Hope you do well with your business because after posting all these messages with this kind of attitude on here, you&#039;re going to create a massive reputation for yourself, and so far, it&#039;s not a good one at all, it&#039;s one no one would want to do business with. Regardless of how good your product is. No one likes to work with a prick. If smoking weed is preventing you from making social connections with people and working in a professional manner as business conduct should be conducted then my advice is you stop. <br /><br />It&#039;s just like in real life, nobody wants to go to a drug dealer who is overely paranoid and thinks people are cops at the slightest bit of slip up they make in his mind, however unintentional it may have been. Those are called sketchy dealers.

				I&#039;ve ordered weed off of oh, just about everybody here. Every UK and EU vendor for sure, and most the Canadian and US ones as well. For those that don&#039;t ship to the UK, I&#039;ve got friends in the US and Canada that forward it for me. I like to have and eighth of anything that I sell seeds for sitting in a curing jar, so I can honestly say I&#039;ve smoked some recently. I&#039;ve tried well over 2,000 strains over the years - I make notes on &#039;em, and have hundred more to try as I&#039;ve got over 2,500 strains of seeds in the old seed vault.<br /><br />Just explaining that so no doofus says I must be a cop because I order a lot of weed.<br /><br />As far as &#039;triple vac sealing&#039; goes, there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding here. I&#039;ve never received weed &#039;smushed&#039; because it was vac sealed. I have received lots that was &#039;smushed&#039; because it was had to be to fit into an envelope to pass customs, but still it&#039;s not squished flat, if carefully spread out enough first.<br /><br />When a vendor triple seals, they don&#039;t let it suck it flat and crush the shit outta everything. What they do is put the first bag in, hit the vac button for a sec or two to get most the air out, but it&#039;s still not crushed and shit. Then, the second layer they vac all the air out - but the first layer is like a little air cushion inside, and keeps it from squishizing the inner bag. Ditto for the third layer.<br /><br />420med4u, lexiesadie, anarcho, hansolo, hashuk, greengiant, listentothemusic... all of them and many, many more have sent me quality weed that was worth the price, wait, and sometimes huge hassle of having it forwarded to me. A few times I did get weed that was pressed as hard as grandma&#039;s&nbsp; Christmas cookies, but it&#039;s kinda like pizza - even when it&#039;s that bad, it&#039;s still pretty good.<br /><br />And Dank, you can dish it out, but you sure can&#039;t take it. It&#039;s easier to push your buttons than it is to hit keys one my laptop.<br /><br />Further to that, you don&#039;t respond to anything but abuse - you had a post about how SR should be transparent about how feedback was calculated. I took the time to find the information for you, laid it out in an easy to read and understand format, and politely linked to the originating posts.<br /><br />And I fucking know you read it - you started the thread. Did you even bother to stop in and at least give a grudging acknowledgement that someone had take the time to research and respond with EXACTLY the information you were looking for, including the math used as the basis?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />And yet you have the nerve to keep saying it&#039;s not your attitude that&#039;s the problem.<br /><br />In that thread the other day that I was quoting your stats at you and pushing your buttons, some nice guy came along and posted not one, but two very good, friendly, and informative posts directed at you, and chock a block full of good advice.<br /><br />Did you take any of that in, or even respond to the guy that had taken the time to produce those two very well thought out posts?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />Dude, really, do you really believe that it&#039;s everyone else out of step, and only you marching to the right tune?

				Locking this thread because Dank only wants to start flame wars. Will unlock it in a bit when thing have cooled down. <br />As I have said before - stick to one thread Mister Dank. This is getting flagrantly out of hand.<br /><br />I have not tried Rocker&#039;s weed; though I have ordered a decent amount of his shrooms which were done extremely professionally. Next up, on the topic of flattened weed. Cannabinoids are contained in the head of the trichome, in fact they are in a fibrous mat at the end of the head. The head of trichome contain two vacuoles, one contains the terpenes and the other phenol. These make their way up the stock of the trichome and combine in the secretory cavity into a fibrous mat. This concentrated mat is hit with UV-B light, causing the creation of cannabinoids. When it is smashed the trichomes break open. When THC is exposed to air, it degrades both in potency and structure. It causes a large portion of the THC to degrade into a cannbinoids found when mis-handling weed. This cannabinoid is only 30% as potent as THC and has very different effect. Specifically the high has a noticeable frontal head presence, a lack of euphoria, and a semi &quot;groggy&quot; stone. Not good medicine, it will get you high but that is not quality. Sativas are particularly delicate in this way as their high is the result of extremely high THC and a relatively low ratio of other cannabinoids. Where as Indica will have a decent amount of CBD, which will be retained to some extent, as with traces of THC, and other cannabinoids. Indica heavy structure also lends it to be protecting some trichomes on the inside of the bud, though sativa&#039;s airy nature generally negate this. <br /><br />I am not accusing anyone of doing this, I just feel people should be made aware of what happens when weed is smashed. It warps, degrades, and even in some cases destroys the high. <br />So far I have yet to see a Vendor sending anything this way. Rook, 420Med4U, LTTM, Anarcho all take proper precautions. I would be glad to buy again from any of them. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

But I like the BRAND NEW argument that they leave some air inside the first one. They must have come up with that one on a conference call - WAY TOO LATE, Variety Jones.<br /><br />&nbsp;One thing you said I&#039;m not so sure about is that Sativas have lower CBDs than Indicas. We just had our weed tested at a lab and the Blue Dream we have (which is about as sativa as they get) tested the highest. The Indicas all had high THC (~20-25%). The highest THC was the NYC Diesel at 26%, a hybrid. My guess is with all the mixed genetics these days its really a crap shoot.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if you remember, but the weed you got from me was in a sealed hard plastic container AND vacuum sealed. It wasn&#039;t smashed at all. I made that point and got attacked - by who and why??? Because I merely suggested that it was odd that with trolls out there, some vendors never get bad ratings, and also that it was doubly odd that a vendor who smashes weed never gets bad ratings.<br /><br />If things are getting out of hand, blame the gang of cops who out themselves for the reasons I mentioned. They need to either come up with real explanations or go home. Everyone knows the people who nailed my feedback are scammers, so why haven&#039;t they went after anyone else?? These fuckers don&#039;t fool me, I know the game when the game is rigged. If Tommyhawk wants to call that paranoia then fuck him, because he hasn&#039;t argued the merits, he&#039;s just using ad hominem - which is what guilty parties do.<br /><br />Tommyhawk, all you did was call names. The only argument you made was that you made you supported my buyer feedback idea. I don&#039;t know anything about what you&#039;ve done. The current feedback system for sellers basically hands the marketplace over to the people with the biggest budget to start the most seller accounts. For all I know, the buyer one you&#039;re helping with will be slanted to those with police budgets as well. I really don&#039;t give a shit what you say - I&#039;m the one with several pounds of chronic weed sitting next to me THAT HASN&#039;T LOST ITS THC CONTENT LIKE ROCKER THE COP&#039;S HAS. If honest buyers don&#039;t want to buy from me, that&#039;s their fucking loss.<br /><br />As to my good feedback, not everyone on here is a scam buyer., Sobchak Did it ever occur to you that maybe other buyers have PM&#039;d me about you guys being cop infiltrators/trolls and just didn&#039;t want to get in a pissing match with you as well? At least in the feedback they&#039;re anonymous so you can&#039;t start name calling my customers!<br /><br />Just more evidence that you&#039;re a douche cop, Sobchak. When I get bad feedback from a known scammer, you lie and try to slander me and say it was my fault. When I get good feedback, you say it must be fake. You haven&#039;t made even one real argument, its just all attack - pure cop bullshit, no doubt in my mind.<br /><br />Oh, but I&#039;m the one ranting, right?...I&#039;m also still selling weed on here. Maybe not everyone is as dumb as you&#039;d like to think they are. The nice thing is, each time someone buys from me, I save one of them from buying from d-bag cops.<br /><br />

But I like the BRAND NEW argument that they leave some air inside the first one. They must have come up with that one on a conference call - WAY TOO LATE, Variety Jones.<br /><br />&nbsp;One thing you said I&#039;m not so sure about is that Sativas have lower CBDs than Indicas. We just had our weed tested at a lab and the Blue Dream we have (which is about as sativa as they get) tested the highest. The Indicas all had high THC (~20-25%). The highest THC was the NYC Diesel at 26%, a hybrid. My guess is with all the mixed genetics these days its really a crap shoot.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m afraid you are really really really mistaken. Please make sure to do research before you post or jsut make yourself look bad.. <br />Blue Dream was bred by DJ Short to incorporate more sativa into is indica Blueberry plant. He ended up choosing a Californian Haze plant (one from San Jose), and through several years of intense breading he made a plant with the medicating effects of blueberry, with the uplifting cerebral effects of Haze. This proved a plant with genetic leanings between 40 - 60% Sativa. In other words a pure hybrid. <br />Indicas generally have 18 - 25 % THC with 1.4 - 2.3 % CBD. Some people differentiate Afghanica and Indica, as there are physical differences and because Afghanica&#039;s have between 20 - 25% THC with .9 - 1.5 CBD creating a balanced effects. There are still plenty of pure genetics, and wonderful glowing examples of pure sativa, or pure indica, but there are also plenty of hybrids,&nbsp; And if Blue Dream is the most Sativa thing you have ever had please go get some good Haze.&nbsp; Or if you can find it Dr. Grinspoon. I happen to study cannabis genetics. ;)<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch<br />

You may have read what you wrote somewhere, but I&#039;m telling you from growing it - I do research on my strains all day, every day. Blue Dream exhibits sativa characteristics in a major way. Its a thin, branchy plant with very thin leaves. I&#039;m talking like 3/8&quot; thin leaves on a 3&#039; tall plant. In veg you almost think it is stunted its so thin. However, the buds come out super dense and I generally get about a 1-1.5 oz per plant (about 3&#039; plants), whereas an indica dominant I can get up to a qp per plant with strains like Chem Dawg and Ak-47. The high from Blue Dream is also very sativa. I smoke weed all day, every day, and Blue Dream is the best for parties cause it doesn&#039;t make you sleepy or out of it, you get more of the talkative, introspective high. <br /><br />Who knows, though, maybe I have a slightly different strain of Blue Dream than what DJ Short put out.<br /><br />As far as Haze goes, I&#039;ll probably never have it at this grow op. My boss originally only wanted indicas for financial reasons. I had to beg to keep the Blue Dream and only was able to talk him into it because it&#039;s so popular, but we won&#039;t be doing anymore sativas in the near future.<br /><br />
