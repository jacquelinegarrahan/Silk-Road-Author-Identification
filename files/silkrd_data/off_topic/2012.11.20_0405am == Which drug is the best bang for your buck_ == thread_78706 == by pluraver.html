				Title pretty much says it all.&nbsp; In your opinions, which drug on Silk Road is the best bang for your buck?<br /><br />And by &quot;buck&quot; I really mean $50 or less, and by &quot;bang&quot; I really mean preferably injectable. ;)

				Id say heroin or K. though i dont bang anything it seems to be the most logical. banging pills is a waste and too expensive for that just get a gram of dope. As for K i love to snort the shit, but never banged it. Though people that ive spoken to say its bliss.

				Assuming you&#039;re not into RC&#039;s,<br /><br />Heroin, MDMA, and benzo&#039;s are clearly the best bang for the buck on SR. Since you can&#039;t IV MDMA (to my knowledge. it seems too risky considering its manufactured in a manor similar to krokodil :o ) that one is out. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to find H in amounts less that $50 on SR, so that is out.<br /><br />Xanax is low priced on SR, especially the bags of alprazolam powder. However, once again, those aren&#039;t under $50.<br /><br />I&#039;d go with some Xanax pills. You can bang them after filtering out the binders and gunk.<br /><br />I have no experience with Ketamine, but from what others are saying it doesn&#039;t sound like a bad choice.

				Personally I would say Mdma or Ket. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really fuck with heroin, but if you&#039;re into it I&#039;ve seen some pretty good prices. Same with meth or speed. If you&#039;re looking for something hard for cheap go with any of these 3.

I haven&#039;t tried Satire or awakened350&#039;s MXE, but every other MXE product from SR has so far been a little disappointing. Not the pre-ban shit I&#039;m used to last Feb. Snow white crystals, almost salt like. The MXE I&#039;ve gotten from SR has always been good, just not as good as it used to be.

				The anesthesiologist get people fucked up on ketamine but unfortunately they don&#039;t remember it after the versed. I&#039;ve never seen a happier person about to get a hip replacement preop. she was in her 60&#039;s<br /><br />people i know seem to get a kick out of shrooms and weed tho, can&#039;t speak from experience tho. you would probably have to be in a decent period in your life to avoid bad trip from the shrooms tho, but that&#039;s where the weed helps.
