				Recently i&#039;ve been getting lucid dreams, which i reckon are related to drug use mainly mdma and trippy shit..<br />Had a few after a bit of a bender at a festival.. I was flying which is something ive never done before in a dream but i got so high up it got pretty scary and i clocked i was dreaming and managed to wake up cos it got real intense..<br /><br />Was also dozing off on the sofa after work today and half asleep kept hearing a loud buzzing noise that i thought was a fly in the room or summit but was too tired and couldn&#039;t actually wake myself up but i could still see...when i managed to get up and look there was no fly and no noise...this kept happening as i dozed off again and i would awake to nothing..then i kept hearing conversations between people and music, kept thinking people got back to my flat but when i managed to wake up properly i was still on my own..&nbsp; :o&nbsp; The music i was hearing i dont rele listen too either and I just got back from a festival so its deffo related to that but its never happened after previous festivals...<br />Maybe its cos i done some acid this time?<br /><br />Fuck knows just some mad shit that freaked me rite out at the time and i thought id see if anyone else has had experience with and knows more about it cos some of u blatently have and im sure its related to drug use..

				Its not drug-related. Sounds like hypnagogia which is the state people go through right before they fall asleep. Being able to tell you&#039;re in this state or being more aware of it could definitely explain the increase in lucid dreams you&#039;ve been having. Happens to everyone, you&#039;re fine I promise.

				In a lucid dream you are usually fully aware of any desicion and choices. Therefore you can consciously talk to dream figures or choose your dream setting. Being caught up in a &quot;given&quot; scenario and experiencing it stronger than usual is imo either drug related or, more likely, due to the state of falling asleep as CaptainTrips said. In this state, when mentally not &quot;fully calm&quot; you tend to wake up and nod off again and again leading to what seems like weird reality perceptions. If you are able to stay calm enough to enter the observer mode you might actually be able to either clearly distinguish that you heard the music in kind of a pre-dream scenario as you were falling asleep instead of in reality, or you might be able to induce a lucid dream by staying in the observer mode. Your explanations sound more like a mixture of perceptions not exclusively relating to any possibility leading to actual lucid dreaming.

				I loooove to lucid dream. I have tried to control when it does and doesn&#039;t happen before but I never can. I have noticed though actually that if I am under the influence of just about ANY drug, I cannot do it. It only happens to me when I&#039;m stone sober, and always right when I first fall asleep. I hear a loud noise too just before it happens, mine sounds like a loud siren or sometimes like a train, and then comes a loud breaking or crackling sound just before it starts, but it doesn&#039;t hurt my ears. I can normally only do it for 10-20 min though then I usually wake up and then fall back asleep for good. I&#039;ll have one maybe once every month or two. Unless I do a lot of drugs daily for long periods then maybe only once every 6 months.

				Thanks for the insigth Inklundulgence,<br />I cant even remember dreams well when doing drugs, so staying sober seems to be fundamental. You are lucky you just get lucid dreams, most people have to acquire a technique for learning how to become aware of the state of dreaming. It&#039;s quite a wishy washy process and I guess most dont get it to work... dreaming &quot;only&quot; for 10-20 mins is actually normal from what I&#039;ve heard, even though pro&#039;s manage to do it for hours not being anymore exhausted when they wake up than if they didn&#039;t lucid dream.<br /><br />Enjoy your lucidity =)
