				Aanyone know how to make gelcaps or gummys of some kind with a low heat method. I would like to put some RCs into predosed form like a gelcap but am worried about what high heat of making gummy candy will degrade the chems.

				if you are making the gummies out of surgel, and a mold, heat isn&#039;t so much of an issue.&nbsp; surgel dissolves in hot water, witbout heating it on the stove most of the time.&nbsp; so you should be ok.&nbsp; just do your homework on your rc, and it&#039;s melting/damaging point.&nbsp; the gummie won&#039;t be a problem if done right, just study all you can about your rc.&nbsp; and don&#039;t forget body chemistry.&nbsp; some rc&#039;s will be destroyed by stomach acid, which would make all of your labor futile.&nbsp; <br /><br />what exactly are you wanting to make, if you don&#039;t mind me asking?

				Sounds like an amazing idea. If your RC would still work fine in a gummy bear, think of the possibilities! Keep us posted!

				4-aco-DMT and 4-aco-DET in 10mg doses. I don&#039;t have a problem measuring my dose from the powder, and mixing with OJ, but my friends want to pop a pill, or eat a tab, so to oblige them, I thought about making gelcaps or gummies, I have some molds for gummies, but they are bigger than I would like to use for a 10mg dose. I will look into surgel.

				honestly, i would just cap em up in vitamin geltabs.&nbsp; you can get empty ones at any drug store or gnc.&nbsp; would be less hastle than making the gummies, and you wouldn&#039;t have to try to mask the bitter taste.

				chocolate is the easiest way to make candies.&nbsp; get your mold, melt the chocolate, fill it half full, dose, then top off.&nbsp; chocolate has a bitter sweet taste anyway, so it really helps mask the bitterness of the rc.&nbsp; personally, i don&#039;t care how bad a rc tastes.&nbsp; i used to snort meth that was made out of ammonia anhydrous.&nbsp; if i can handle that nasty drain, there isn&#039;t a rc out there that flavor would put me off.&nbsp; <br /><br />but, gummies or chocolate is great for transportation purposes. filling empty gel caps and putting them in some herbal supplement bottle is a close second.&nbsp; &nbsp;i guess it really comes down to how fancy you want to get, and if your clients will appreciate the time and culinary art you put into it.<br /><br />
