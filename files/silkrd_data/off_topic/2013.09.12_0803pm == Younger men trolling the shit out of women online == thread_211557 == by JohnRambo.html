				Over 80 percent of women in the UK surveyed said they &quot;very strongly&quot; support stronger laws to combat online trolling, including making a system where you cannot post anonymously anymore and have to use your real identity.<br /><br />There are two things I pick up from that.<br /><br />1. Women are natural fascists who hate freedom of speech. Funny how when women are given the right to vote, the country always slides into liberalism, communism, and fascism.<br /><br />2. Women are so stupid, they don&#039;t realize that WOMEN THEMSELVES would be hurt the most by having the ability to post anonymously taken away. After all, if women have to use their real identity when posting a comment, it would make it a lot easier to find out her personal info, address, and then dox and troll the shit out of her. Apparently, these dumb bitches never considered that point. So go ahead and destroy internet privacy for all I care. Women will be hurt the hardest from that. And if a bitch makes a man-hating&nbsp; feminist type of comment, it will make it very easy to track her down and then dox her.<br /><br />Women declared a &quot;war of the sexes&quot; even though women are literally too unintelligent to know how to properly wage a war, and end up sabotaging themselves at every point.<br /><br />Funny how studies show that women are more unhappy NOW than at any other time in history. It seems that women WANT to be dominated and controlled and enslaved. But thankfully for feminism, feminism liberated MEN from being slaves to women, and now we men are free to live without marrying a woman.<br /><br />Feminism liberated MEN from the slavery of marriage. So go ahead and keep promoting your feminism and telling us men how &quot;big strong and independent&quot; you ladies are. We will laugh at you and refuse to marry you and travel to places like Asia where we can bang hot women who are still feminine and submissive.<br /><br />Enjoy growing old alone with your ten cats, ladies.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;I have this beef with a lot of organizations, including EFF,&quot; Aurora said. &quot;This is another case where they’re saying, ‘The cases we care about are the ones white men are interested in. We’re less interested in protecting women on the web.’&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stupidest quote in the world. The reason we want to Free Weev is not because he is a white man, but because his &quot;hacking&quot; essentially consisted of changing his browsers user agent and hitting refresh. It isn&#039;t his fault that the servers he was visiting were so fucking insecure that this allowed him to get an entire list of customer E-mail addresses. It would be like if I have a website that dumps its entire database to somebody using Firefox, and then say that everyone using Firefox hacked me. He should never have been charged with hacking for what he did. Also, when they were searching him for hacking crimes they happened to stumble on some 2c-b tabs and other drugs, which is another part of his charges. What does this woman think the EFF is going to do, fight against a bullshit hacking charge or protect her from a troll? They are not the Womans Defense Frontier, they are the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&nbsp;

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There were plenty of techies who criticized Auernheimer and said he was getting his due. But the debate over his case was larger than anything that has ever occurred regarding internet harassment. That wasn’t lost on the women who have been threatened with rape and death while online. What it came down to for them was that a man who threatens women can generate more concern within the tech industry than female victims of abuse.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is why I don&#039;t like emotional people very much. Weev did not generate concern in the tech industry. That some person who happened to be weev was being prosecuted for some bullshit hacking charge is what caused concern in the tech industry. That person just happened to be Weev. Also, although it is fucked up he spammed this womans information, 90% of what he does is just trolling for attention. He is really not that bad of a guy in my experience. He might say crazy outlandish shit fairly regularly, but if you take it personally (which you will because you are super emotional), then you are just bothering yourself. Seriously, Hitler himself could have been charged with hacking in this case, and the tech industry would be upset about it. It is the case that has people upset by the government, Weev is only related to it in that he is the one they charged.

				JohnRambo if you aren&#039;t already familiar with him, you should read into the cartoonist Dave Sim.&nbsp; He is a truly great cartoonist but mid-career he started speaking out about men and women and was essentially disowned by most cartoonists and fans.&nbsp; I think you would find a lot of his writing interesting.

				How much longer are we men going to just sit here and tolerate women destroying freedom of speech and freedom in general in the name of &quot;tolerance&quot; and &quot;political correctness&quot;? Something like 80 percent of female voters vote for the liberal parties in Europe.<br /><br />Do we just have to sit back and let society collapse before things change? Do we just need to give women enough rope so that they can hang themselves? Give women enough freedom and they will destroy society, and that is exactly what is happening in the West today.<br /><br />Of course women are too stupid to understand that they are destroying the very society which gave them so much freedom in the first place. Hence proving the point that women truly are less intelligent than men and should never be given freedom. Once women are given freedom, that marks the beginning of the downfall of that society.

				Before i start, as a woman, i just want to say that i fully respect your opinions and what ever you have to say JohnRambo. With that i hope you allow me to express my opinions as well since they differ from yours. <br /><br />You cant blame what particular group of people of your problems - women in this case. Then again if you have had bad experiences with women, that still doesnt put half of world population in the same position. It&#039;s deceivingly too easy to think <br />that every asshole can be recognized from high heels. That easy that you can even come blind to real indicators.<br /><br />I dont think you can either take all men on your side in this matter since many of them might not feel same way as you. It&#039;s better if you only speak for yourself like i do.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know are women in &quot;control&quot; at modern society, but leaving responsibility only to a certain group of people is unstable opinion. I dont know what good you see in history that was mostly controlled by men, but in my opinion it&#039;s benefit for men as well that they dont need to act as a parent to their partner, but get equal support. <br /><br />And having control of own life doesn&#039;t mean pushing others down.<br />You also mentioned that all best women can be found outside America, but from other forums in my country i have seen similar person type as yours and they say best women also can be found outside my country. Again it&#039;s too easy to think that grass is greener somewhere else. Especially if problem fallows you where ever you go. <br /><br />Without any further association...<br />cheers<br /><br /><br />
