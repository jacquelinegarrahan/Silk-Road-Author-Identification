				I&#039;m about to attempt my first cannabis grow, and I&#039;m going outdoors. I&#039;ve watched a video on youtube which seems to be pretty helpful, however it really seems a bit basic, and I want to see if you guys think this is effective.<br /><br />-First, find a north facing patch and dig it up, leave for a week or so.<br />-Lay down organic fertilizer pellets containing feather and fish meal, composted seaweed, poultry manure and blood and bone.<br />-Lay down powdered Lime on top of your fertilizer and turn soil into itself with a garden hoe.<br />-Leave for another week, and in this time germinate your seeds and keep them in small pots, watering once in the morning and once at night until they have 4 leaves before moving them into your patch.<br /><br />The guy in the video says this is all he does as far as fertilizer and nutrients but it just seems a bit basic. Will this yield good results? Any tips or advice will be greatly appreciated.

				That would be a straight organic grow depending on the fertilizer pellets you use. <br /><br /><br />You can do all these steps and the plant will be fed throughout its life. You can skip all those steps and use a product like Advanced nutrients heavy harvest.. <br /><br />They have products for all stages of growth. <br /><br />Keep it simple for your first grow. :) If you have any questions ask away. I have grown a large amount of weed indoors and out. <br />

				Yes you should do fine. <br /><br />Depending on the condition of the soil at your grow spot you may want to add some &quot;Promix BX or HP&quot;&nbsp; if the soil has a lot of clay in it. <br /><br />Marijuana loves soil or a soiless medium that drains well.&nbsp;
