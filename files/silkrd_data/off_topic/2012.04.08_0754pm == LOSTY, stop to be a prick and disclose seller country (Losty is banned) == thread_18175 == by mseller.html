				Losty disclosed origin once more, I lost count but think this is 5.th time ...<br /><br /><br />MODS already removed it many times but Losty want drop this. Total out of line and ground for banning.<br /><br />LOSTY GET LOST<br /><br />I can play the similar game but would never go that low as you do. Its not a game for me, neither should be for you!<br />Be careful with sweet talkers, they like to chit chat all day long, send 100pm and want to know sensitive info, like name and address. Losty would use it to get what he want and blackmail the seller! He proved that he has not honor or face!<br />You just can not grow up and continue to act as a child! I ask you nicely stop with this, you are hurting all SR with your private things and pathetic revenge! It can not hurt me much but surely is not allowed on Silk Road.<br /><br />He can lie and say baseless accusation until end of time, he does not have order with me and both order what he got 2 month ago he rated 5/5 (week ago he change it with lies to 1/5 but I have screenshot and feedback freshness proves that is old delivered orders with great product review.<br />He want to convince everybody that he dont have couple of dollars for SR fee and that I will risk losing my sellers account? WTH for? Feedback and escrow gives both of us protection and admin can confirm transaction! He abused all in trying to hurt my reputation, wau, are you so sad and lonely not to have any real life?<br />You are clearly shown dishonesty and I seriously doubt that my help for free did not arrived. Macman what you mention as other guy with &quot;lost&quot; orders does have transaction number and he received it an week ago and he confirmed it personaly in the forum.I mention this just as response to your accusations and what you spread false rumors. What I give for free is nobody business.<br />Stop to cry and bitch about order what does not exist! If you got transaction # you would submitted it by now. Buyers has resolution and admin to sort dispute if we can not sort ourselves. You are attention freak and I can care less about your bitching and your opiate withdraw problems, its your own fault of using you mdone from MMT in 2 days what should last for 2 weeks. Real orders with transaction# do arrive and only you wait and blame overseas vendor when not having order to begin with, how absurd is that!<br /><br />GET OFF MY BACK ALREADY !
