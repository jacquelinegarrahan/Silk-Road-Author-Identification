				Hey folks,<br /><br />I see very often, that tormail.org is down and the email will not be delivered.<br />You can access tormail, but you don&#039;t get email or can send emails.<br /><br />So I have start a new Service called mailtor.org<br /><br />You can reach it under: http://bdom5vcb53z5hqz5.onion<br /><br />Registration is very easy and free.<br />I have used the new Roundcube Version and set up a very fast Server.<br />Your password will save salted in the database and the hard drive of the<br />server is crypted. So if someone will check the hard drive, he cant find anything.<br /><br />This service can only be used with Tor and you must go over the browser.<br /><br />For support: support@mailtor.org<br /><br />Greetings :)

				Haha,<br /><br />sorry, but I dont will take money for it!<br />It is hosted on a server for 6 EUR! Is has enough resources.<br /><br />At this moment I am scripting an PGP Plugin for roundcube that the users can use<br />to encrypt their mails.<br /><br />Why I make mailtor.org?<br />As I say, tormail is often down and is not really fast. So I build up my own service!<br /><br />Who I am?<br />I am a big guy in the Bitcoin scene and are also selling on SR!<br />But I will not say my real SR name because I will stay anonym.<br /><br />I have also some other user accounts on the board, but I will support<br />with this user name, so everybody knows, who I am!<br /><br />I created it only for me for private use, but why not make it public?<br />I hope someone will trust me, if not ... its not a problem :)<br />I will only give you a good service!

				Thanks for doing this Mailtor. Ill try out your service but ill only be using PGP encrypted messages. Tor&nbsp; is extremely unreliable and if you have a solution I am willing to try it. We need more competition in the TOR world to build a better tor in general. <br /><br />I mean with the rise of the use of the tor network I wouldnt be surprised if we started seeing competitive marketing websites trying to make a few bucks...<br /><br /><br />Anyway hopefully people will try it out and remove the tin foil hats for a minute.

				Seriously people, why are you giving this guy such a hard time? For all we know tormail itself could be a honeypot, we should always act as such. The main point is ALWAYS use PGP for any email correspondence with someone from this site(and I wouldn&#039;t touch a PGP plugin with a ten foot stick, I&#039;m not too lazy to copy-paste).

				hey guys,<br /><br />thanks for the first positive feedbacks.<br />I am really not interested to read your mails.<br />AND it is welcome to use pgp and i will support everything with pgp!<br /><br />maybe i found another good solution for better integrating pgp.<br />it is right, if i offer an pgp plugin, it can be, that i copy the text into a database / file and can read them.<br />maybe i found a solution with a api to another pgp service site.

				I think your service needs some work before it&#039;s ready for prime time. I&#039;ve created a couple accounts now and when trying to log in, it tells me my password is wrong.<br /><br />account: tester<br />pswd: tester<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				roundcube uses javascript right? what options do you have that do not use javascript?<br /><br />and tormail isn&#039;t down very often. I mean, yes sometime delivery is slow, but everything is slow on a hidden service it seems, so how will yours be any different?

				I would hope they didn&#039;t use a Real Name to register the domain.<br /><br />There are other possibly much worse security problems too, which I&#039;ve pointed out to the developer already.<br /><br />

The chief advantage of TorMail is that no one knows who the admins are, nor where they are located. Therefore, they cannot be arrested, nor can they be pressured to turn over information. The same cannot be said of you, unfortunately. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t know what you search for or see, but my name is not written somewhere.<br />And the domain whois is protected!
