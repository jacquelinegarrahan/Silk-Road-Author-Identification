				My husband and I have talked to everyone we know IRL and online. I&#039;m using this post as a last resort because we haven&#039;t found anyone who can help us yet. Here&#039;s what&#039;s going on.......<br /><br />We moved across the state about 6 months ago because our children are here with my mom. We have been looking for work non stop, literally applying for jobs every day but we live in such a shitty area that there just isn&#039;t anywhere to work. My husband finally got a call back for a general manager position at a local restaurant. He went to the interview this morning and the owner said that he wanted to hire my husband on the spot. There was just one problem. My husband doesn&#039;t have a valid drivers license. It was suspended due to non payment of traffic violations. In order to get his license reinstated, we have to come up with $750.<br /><br />I am certainly not asking for a handout. If anyone could loan the money, my husband and I would be willing to pay back $1500 within two months of him getting the job. I understand that $750 is a lot to ask for but as I said, this really is our last resort. We could probably even work it out so where you can pay the DMV directly. That way, you know where your money is going.<br /><br />If anyone has ideas on how we could raise the money (quickly) or where we could get a loan with bad credit, please let me know. We are really desperate and need at the very least ideas. Selling drugs is out of the question because we don&#039;t know anyone except my mother where we are living.

				I would recommend the direct to DMV option if you go that route, people are a lot more likely to help someone out if they can be sure that their good deeds funding is being used for the purpose stated.<br /><br />Also have you asked the DMV about a payment plan? that might help to begin to pay it off.<br /><br />Last but not least, if this is a must get, an option to consider is to go to your bank, apply for a line of credit and use it for the emergency that you have. Going into debt might not seem like a good idea but it is something to consider and can alleviate the situation for the short term.<br /><br />Your husband can ask his future boss for an advance of some sort if he explains his situation and if the boss knows that your husband does not have his license currently.<br /><br /><br />Personally I&#039;d go the bank credit route as it deals with the problem right away and if you plan well enough you will be able to pay off your debt in short order.<br /><br />Ps. have you asked friends and family for help? you&#039;d be surprised how helpful they can be.

				Thank you for the advice, Marlon. We talked to family, posted all over Facebook, called everyone we could think of and nothing. That&#039;s why I came here and posted.<br /><br />The thing with getting a line of credit with a bank is that both of our credit scores are just awful. We screwed around way too much when we were younger and we&#039;re paying for it now.<br /><br />I also thought that maybe he could call the restaurant and really explain the situation and ask them to hire him on as a cook (he&#039;s already trained for that) until we can get things in order. I&#039;ll mention your idea to see if they would give an advance to him as well.<br /><br />I kind of wish I knew someone in the mafia right now. I&#039;d be willing to make a deal with them! Lol

				No need for the mafia, just need to be honest with everyone involved. That way you aren&#039;t holding anything back and can be certain you have tried everything in your power.<br /><br />Also you can always ask your bank or make an apt and explain your situation, you&#039;d be amazed at time with banks giving out money, trust me, they want your money!

				Thanks for the advice. I&#039;m going to do some research on the banks in my area to see if they can do anything for us. Hopefully some friends will come through as well. Thanks again!

				OP<br /><br />This isn&#039;t really the proper &quot;forum&quot; to ask for assistance with a DMV bill but I so understand last resourts. You would be better off in a non anonymous forum where someone can feel directly responsible for helping. Check your local churches and support groups. In the meantime learn to use public transportation, bicycle, etc. Further - Your husband can apply for an occupational license while he pays down the bill. <br /><br />If your husband is smart, and drives carefully he can drive the vehicle back and forth to work. I drove for over a year on a revoked license using a stolen plate without an issue. Do the speed limit, drive defensively and in a few weeks time he would have generated the funds needed to pay off the license.

				I totally understand this is the wrong forum to ask for assistance in that aspect of my life but if I went to a non anonymous forum, I wouldn&#039;t know anyone there. So, I came here since I have some acquaintances on these forums. At least I didn&#039;t post it in the Shipping section or anything crazy like that!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyway, churches and support groups aren&#039;t bad ideas. The thing is, transportation to and from work isn&#039;t the issue because my mother is willing to pick him up to drive him to and from work. It&#039;s the company that is the problem. They told him that they couldn&#039;t hire him if he didn&#039;t have a valid drivers license. It makes no sense whatsoever to us but rules are rule, I guess.<br /><br />I&#039;ll make some calls to some churches and see if there are any support groups in the area also. Thanks for your two cents, paxpax!
