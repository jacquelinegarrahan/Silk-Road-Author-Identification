				So for the people who read my last thread about starting a grow,&nbsp; finally i should be starting in the next 2 weeks. Gonna only have 1800 watts and gonna start with Barney&#039;s farm critical kush. After the first harvest I will be able to add some more lights and get a larger variety of strains. Just don&#039;t have the cash to get most of the strains I really want. Heard good things about critical Kush&#039;s yields and potency so that is why I chose it. If people are still interested I can still make a thread on my grow to keep everybody updated on the progress. Peace!

				Hey dude, idk where your from, or what your marijuana network is like, but if your looking for real success in the weed game, as far as growing goes, your going to need to get some cuttings. <br /><br />&nbsp;Commercial strains bought from seed banks really kind of suck. You need to find some bomb ass genetics and get some clones. If thats not an option, try to stick with cali connection seeds, or get your shit off thcbay, so you can go through smaller connoisseur type breeders. Good luck

				If you can&#039;t get cuttings, try getting seeds from Sensi Seeds. They really know their shit and have some of the best-stabilized genetics, which is especially useful for beginners :)

				when i grew i got the seeds from nirvana and started a mother plant then cloned from that&nbsp; with an aeroponic clone machine which i built DIY&nbsp; <br />LOL<br /><br />roots in 5 days 8 days to put in soil or soil less medium.<br /><br />Good Luck!!!<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />ChemCat<br /><br />8)

				Ya I don&#039;t have access to any cuttings. Had great results from some big bud plants I grew from seed a little over a year ago. I will be taking clones from the plants I grow from seed and pick one for a mother plant. Don&#039;t have enough money right now for Cali connection or reservation privada since I plan on doing around 30 plants and both Cali connect and reserva are pretty expensive considering they only do 6 packs.

				1800 watts?!?<br />that&#039;s not very much homie!!<br />unless you&#039;ve got a small room i suppose..<br /><br />the average setup i&#039;ve worked on had a 2400 watt veg room and a 6000 watt flower room..<br />not be like ooooh look at me, but this one in san fransisco was like 10000 sq ft, running off a 480v main, with 277v converted&nbsp; ballasts.. it was in the 100&#039;s of thousands of watts!! <br />i didn&#039;t make a dime off that job either!!&nbsp; :( but i made some stellar connections!!&nbsp; ;)

				Use light movers and super spreaders, will increase your yield by around 40%. ;)

				I am gonna be using a 12x12 room for this cycle and then I will be moving my grow somewhere permanent. Prob have a 3600w flower room. I did order some super spreaders. Light movers would be nice but I can&#039;t afford them right now. Very limited budget. Wanted to run 2400 watts hut had to settle for 3 lights instead of 4 due to money issues. Prob. Gonna put my grow up on this new site moonshiner has which is like a kick starter for marijuana grows lol

				OK so I got my seeds ordered and I had to upgrade my lights due to issues running my bulbs so I will now be running 3000 watts instead of 1800.

				I&#039;m gonna prob do the co2 bag things depending on price. I have a very limited budget for the startup but will be getting a co2 generator or whatever u call it after first harvest. I&#039;m not sure how I&#039;m gonna do the 3 1000 watt lights yet cuz last time I ran 2 and it almost blew a fuse or whatever. The breaker box is in that room and its almost right below the washer and dryer upstairs which is a 100 amp circuit so I might see if I can somehow go through the vent or something? Its not my house so idk if I will be able to do anything major electricity wise.
