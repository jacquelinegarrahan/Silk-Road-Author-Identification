				Hey guys, I haven&#039;t seen a thread about this yet so I decided to make one. I want to hear some suggestions by everyone about what to do while you&#039;re tripping! I&#039;m about to this weekend and would love some recommendations on stuff to do, look at, watch, listen to, etc. No matter how small it is, if it&#039;s worthwhile, tell us! I&#039;ve heard that looking at the back of a CD is pretty crazy, never done it yet lol.

				I usually prefer natural things to digital. Music of course is great, but it&#039;s hard to beat a walk in the woods.

				take a bath, smell things, play with open fire, draw, paint, make music, socialize, look at yourself, breathe, pick your nose, think, dance, sing, eat, try to pick up girls, meditate, explore forests, freak out, white noise, scream, leave the world behind, let your love grow strong....

				No time is ever time wasted when spent in the presence of Nature and in the company of Solitude.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly certain there is a thread of a comprehensive list of cool things to do while tripping. Let me look for a sec.

				Music. I don&#039;t know if you consider potent MXE tripping, but when I&#039;m dosed up on the right amount, I can just jam out in front of my computer listening to music. I usually put my library on shuffle, so I&#039;m listening to a large variety of genres. I listen to any genre... if the artist or music itself attracts me, it doesn&#039;t matter who or what it is. My favorite genre is rap/hip-hop. A$AP Mob/Rocky, Wiz Khalifa, Kendrick Lamar, Juicy J, Juelz Sanana, and many others...<br /><br />Music is great.

				Hey Guys I created a thread on this and compiled the list of things to do.&nbsp; It&#039;s impressive, and I&#039;ve done a fair bit of them.&nbsp; I definitely recommend printing this out or something.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;:)<br />HERE IS THE COMPLETE UPDATED LIST.&nbsp; ;D ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at everyones suggestions and here is the full list of amaaaaaazing things to do while tripping.&nbsp; If you did even 1/4 of the things on here, you&#039;d have the best trip ever.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;D<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Walking, being outside in nature...go for a hike or go camping.&nbsp; Stare at the Moon.<br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.<br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Concert or Rave<br />5. Painting or Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on Acid...the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.<br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metalic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You havent seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!<br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good.<br />10.&nbsp; Go Paintballing on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.<br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other.<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.<br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)<br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.<br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)<br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museaum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining.<br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer?&nbsp; I’m told this is cool on Acid but I have yet to try it, lots of people recommend it.<br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid.<br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />45.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />46. Pet a cat or a furry animal...it&#039;s extremely fun.&nbsp; Somehow, they &quot;know&quot; you&#039;re tripping.&nbsp;
