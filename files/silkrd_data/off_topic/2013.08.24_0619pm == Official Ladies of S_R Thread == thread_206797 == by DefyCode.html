				The Australians have one, so maybe the girls of SR should too. We can use this to review each other, girl advice, female-specific drug advice, whatever-the-fuck, and anything else.<br /><br />I&#039;m a mid-20&#039;s american girl, irish/british mix, i work out a lot, work on cars and partake in various less-than-legal activities.<br /><br />Maybe this will take off, maybe not, but hey I&#039;m here, where are the other gals.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />-xoxo

				it&#039;s been done and it didn&#039;t take off. i would like to see some female specific drug advice though, we never had that last time. side saddle is generally considered more dignified for the ladies but if you&#039;re doing dissociatives then don&#039;t worry your pretty little head about it :D ?

				Oh hey now just because we didn&#039;t all learn to ride side saddle doesn&#039;t mean we cant chat it up..<br /><br />I have a decade or two on you OP, and share the same lineage. I also happen to have spent time assisting on muscle car rebuilding, my favorite cars being 1967 Impala and 1968 Mercury Cougar. <br /><br />Drugs wise I have knowledge of the opiates, more then I would like.

				I think thats just females in general especially when something happy is happening. I won&#039;t lie I have a bad thing with coke at the moment, I&#039;m burning through at least half a gram a day sometimes a full gram, it turned into my coffee, can&#039;t function without it really. I posted in another thread that I want to not be so dependent and I&#039;m going to start tapering off a bit starting tomorrow actually, even got some xanax to deal with the come-down bit...it&#039;s going to suck. I&#039;ve only been on SR for what? like a month maybe still a newbie but I&#039;m getting the hang of things :) As much as my natural curiosity wants to ask you about your life, I won&#039;t (cuz of damn security reasons)...hmmm I know! Where is the one place that you think people should visit in Scotland that is hardly ever visited by tourists? :) :)

				I&#039;ve been to Scotland..&nbsp; And from what I can tell, they have the same kinda booze over there that we have in the states.&nbsp; The exception being beverages like shandy, etc..&nbsp; Those are pretty rare in the states.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen any buckfast here in the US yet.&nbsp; It&#039;s probably best if it stays that way ;)<br /><br />A couple differences about the beer that I noticed:<br /><br />In certain pubs, they will have on tap 2 styles of Guinness..&nbsp; regular draught and one that is served much colder.&nbsp; I prefer my brew served cool anyways, keep that ice cold shit for the frat-boys. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m up too early and I am way too stoned for this time of day.&nbsp; Sorry to interrupt your thread.

				I always wondered why there wasn&#039;t one of these before.&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I didn&#039;t look quite hard enough!<br /><br />American here, spent most of my growing up in other countries (including Scotland!) though.&nbsp; I&#039;m in between 20 and 30 years of age.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a strong love for computers and all sorts of video games.&nbsp; I also love the outdoors, hiking, rock climbing, snowboarding in the winters.&nbsp; Not crazy about water sports although more and more people are trying to get me into them.<br /><br />My DOC is mostly weed these days.&nbsp; Occasionally I&#039;ll binge on oxy for a couple days if I&#039;m really bored at work.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually never for more than 3 days at most so I never have to deal with a withdrawal.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only recently tried molly and liked it quite a bit.&nbsp; Never tried psychs or dissociatives or anything like that.&nbsp; I&#039;m really getting more and more curious about psychs though, most likely I&#039;ll try some LSD at some point in the near future.<br /><br />Anyways, enough about me, sounding off!&nbsp; ;)

This seems fun&nbsp; &nbsp;:D.<br /><br />I came here to look for alternative medical options to my illness although this place has proven to be interesting in many other ways as well. So far i have used only MDMA and weed, but there is few other options in my bucket list as well.<br />I&#039;ve always known the hidden network(i have worked with computers), but didn&#039;t think i would end up using it.<br /><br />And im early twenties.

				Hi There!&nbsp; Don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t notice this thread until now...&nbsp; ???&nbsp; Didn&#039;t realize there were even this many ladies on the road.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lol..&nbsp; I&#039;m always getting called man, dude, sir... etc...&nbsp; but hey... anonymity, right?&nbsp; Guess I&#039;ve been spending most of the time I&#039;m online in the Official Spare Coin Thread to have noticed this one.&nbsp; Just got done reading it from the beginning.&nbsp; Tried to +1 you DefyCode for making this thread, but I guess I already did in the Spare Coin Thread...&nbsp; 72 hour rule..&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />So, I don&#039;t really like to talk about myself much... anonymously or not.&nbsp; But, here&#039;s a little.&nbsp; It would be easier to list the drugs I&#039;ve not done than the ones I have...&nbsp; then again, I&#039;m at least old enough to be your mom Defy..&nbsp; so have had a lot of time to have gone through all the ones I did.&nbsp; Now, I really only have one DOC and it&#039;s currently considered by &quot;society&quot; to be the evilest of all....&nbsp; :o&nbsp; But &quot;society&quot; knows fuck all... only what&#039;s spoon fed to them by the mainstream media.&nbsp; I like meth...&nbsp; and that&#039;s about it.&nbsp; I used to do a lot of coke (mentioning this because DefyCode mentioned it in her OP), and I thought I liked it... as long as I had it.&nbsp; But the comedown was just too awful for me.&nbsp; I was working 9-5 Mon-Fri at the time and of course, every Friday, I&#039;d always have forgotten just how bad was the comedown... until the next Monday... and around and around...&nbsp; hated he cycle.&nbsp; So, now I do meth.&nbsp; For me at least, I can do some and be fine for most of the day or night and the comedown isn&#039;t so sudden and awful in the same way as coke was for me.&nbsp; But, it&#039;s different.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing it for so long that I&nbsp; just use it to feel normal and functional.&nbsp; I also like to do some opiates on occasion, but I had my heroin years...&nbsp; haven&#039;t done any of that now in over 20 years, but I never forget how quickly you can get a tolerance and physically dependant on opiates of any kind... so, I limit it to occasionally.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s funny, I was aware of the road for a long time before I actually joined...&nbsp; mainly because I have easy local access to anything I would want that is offered on the road.&nbsp; But then a circumstance came along where I needed something (not a drug) that I did not have easy access to.&nbsp; So, I joined, figured I&#039;d order what I needed.. then found out that I needed rep/feedback/stats.. whatever...&nbsp; and at the time, I also thought that I needed 50 forum posts before I could order.&nbsp; Not really sure where I got that idea... but I thought I had to.&nbsp; I hated making those posts because I never really have been much of a forum person even on the clearnet.. don&#039;t have a facebook, twitter or any of those kind of things.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, I made my 50 posts (found out it was unnecessary) placed a few small orders... e-books, etc..&nbsp; and finally got the thing I needed in the first place.&nbsp; But ironically, now, whenever I get a chance to get online when I&#039;m not busy IRL with this or that.&nbsp; I come directly to the forum and just post away and love it!&nbsp; Then got addicted to the Spare Coin Thread...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />O.K.&nbsp; enough about me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Was just going to say that I think this thread is a great idea!<br /><br />Cheers! ;D

I also posted a thread about Actavis in anticipation of a real life connect, that real life connect turned out to be garbage, so I did not end up posting it.<br /><br />You are trolling me and others. You accuse many people of being LE. I&#039;d suggest finding something better to do, you really are not welcomed here.&nbsp; Your less than 100 posts and -36 (and counting) karma is more than telling. <br /><br />@incubusdriver: lol yep gotcha get ready to do a gazillion years in a supermax!

And yep you are right my products are all technically legal ATM. I will be selling drugs in the near future. I&#039;m a new vendor, you&#039;re right ~1 month into it. Even though I might make a bad IRL spy I&#039;m being really methodical in how I will start selling drugs on here. If you must know the things I want to be 100% certain about before I start moving illegal product are the following:<br /><br />1. Supplier: I need to make sure my IRL connect is steady, trustworthy and consistent.<br />2. Shipping: I need to have enough supplies in stock to ship stealthily, quickly, consistently and be able to take on unexpected demand accordingly.<br />3. Capital: Since i do not plan on requiring FE, ever, I also want to have a comfortable level of IRL capital to fulfill orders seamlessly.<br />4. Laundering: I need to have a method to move around BTC &gt; Fiat and vice versa in a way that reduces the possibility of raising red flags.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go into detail on which one&#039;s I have ready or how close I am to having those things done, but if I don&#039;t have anything illegal on my vendor page atm it is for a reason. Could I list a pound of cannabis right now? Yeah I could, but it would be without the things I just aforementioned being good and ready to go. <br /><br />There are more tactful ways to call someone out or verify legitimacy. <br /><br />@incubusdriver: hahaha you&#039;re awesome. I&#039;m def getting your copy services once you get your vendor account up and going! Thanks!

May i ask what LE means? Keep the thread going &lt;3&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No worries hun it took me a while to understand the acronym as well<br /><br />LE = Law Enforcement<br />FE = Finalize Early<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And how long have you been here? Your already have a unprofitable vendor account selling legal products primarily targeting vendors. You hobnob with people loaning bitcoins and gossiping.&nbsp; But it is also the nature of the products that you are selling: Cell phone burners, glassware, empty capsules and Panamanian shell companies... <br /><br />You talk a good game. You&#039;ve done coke, you&#039;re interested in DMT. Blah blah blah.<br /><br />Why not put something on your vendor account that would guarantee that you aren&#039;t LE? It wouldn&#039;t take much to capsule up some MDMA and start shipping it off to people. You might even make some money. But then LE really wouldn&#039;t do that, would they?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your forum stalking me ey? Actually still do coke. And yep you are right my products are all technically legal ATM. I will be selling drugs in the near future. I&#039;m a new vendor, you&#039;re right ~1 month into it. Even though I might make a bad IRL spy I&#039;m being really methodical in how I will start selling drugs on here. If you must know the things I want to be 100% certain about before I start moving illegal product are the following:<br /><br />1. Supplier: I need to make sure my IRL connect is steady, trustworthy and consistent.<br />2. Shipping: I need to have enough supplies in stock to ship stealthily, quickly, consistently and be able to take on unexpected demand accordingly.<br />3. Capital: Since i do not plan on requiring FE, ever, I also want to have a comfortable level of IRL capital to fulfill orders seamlessly.<br />4. Laundering: I need to have a method to move around BTC &gt; Fiat and vice versa in a way that reduces the possibility of raising red flags.<br /><br />I won&#039;t go into detail on which one&#039;s I have ready or how close I am to having those things done, but if I don&#039;t have anything illegal on my vendor page atm it is for a reason. Could I list a pound of cannabis right now? Yeah I could, but it would be without the things I just aforementioned being good and ready to go. <br /><br />There are more tactful ways to call someone out or verify legitimacy. <br /><br />@incubusdriver: hahaha you&#039;re awesome. I&#039;m def getting your copy services once you get your vendor account up and going! Thanks!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Defy you do not need to defend or explain yourself to this muppet.&nbsp; He&#039;s an asshat who loves to stir up trouble on the forums and he gives vendors a particularly hard time - the whole BruceCampbell fiasco.<br /><br />This thread is a safe place and no one is judging you here.&nbsp; Just ignore him, full stop.<br /><br />ON the flipside though I am really excited for you and your SR business.&nbsp; It really sounds like you&#039;ve got a good strategy together!&nbsp; :)

				Thanks mary,&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d really care much for a chatroom - I guess that&#039;s about what an Internet Relay Chat would be probably minus a moderator?&nbsp; Anyway, I was mainly just curious since recently I&#039;ve seen a lot of people talking about it.. was wondering if it was an invite only thing or something that I could just check out to satisfy my curiousity is all...&nbsp; &nbsp; I may ask her about it though...&nbsp; &nbsp;hope your day is off to a good start! :) <br /><br />Oh, btw, I checked out ChemCat&#039;s Family Thead earlier... seems like the OSCT minus the idiots :D&nbsp; Only thing, seems I musta missed everyone..&nbsp; &nbsp;only Kalli was there.&nbsp; But thanks again about letting me know about it.&nbsp; Will try again when it&#039;s not like 4:am like I did earler... lol..&nbsp;

				About the IRC.. yes there are different rooms there is #public and #cheers and a couple others I can&#039;t remember.&nbsp; Those two are the main ones though.&nbsp; Honestly #public these days is basically a newbie forum for the IRC.&nbsp; It gives us a chance to weed out trolls and whatnot.&nbsp; #cheers is invite only but if you know anyone that already has an invite you can get an invite to #cheers.&nbsp; It seems a bit complicated but it really isn&#039;t.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been on the IRC in a bit myself but I&#039;m probably going to get back on sometime soon!

				So it&#039;s official.&nbsp; Atomos has been gracious enough to give the Ladies of SR their own IRC channel!&nbsp; It is invite only so any ladies or &#039;approved&#039; gents may join.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; There&#039;s no obligation or anything and if you want to try it and don&#039;t like it no hard feelings from me!&nbsp; If no one is interested then we&#039;ll just let it go but if you&#039;d like to chat somewhere where there won&#039;t be any trolling or people outside of our invited group reading then I think it&#039;ll be nice.&nbsp; If you want an invite send me a PM or say something here and we&#039;ll see how it goes!<br /><br />If you want to join but need help getting the IRC set up let me know that as well and I&#039;ll see what I can do.&nbsp; :D

First you should know better than to call out a girl publicly IRL or in the net.&nbsp; The girls having their own chatroom is the equivalent of girl congregating together in a party or at a bar and chatting together out of male-earshot. We are still in the same circle and crowd of friends but sometimes we just like to have girl talk. Her effort in establishing our own chatroom was not with the intention of segregating or isolation. The fact that she did it will probably motivate male-averse females to come along too! So if anything she helped and you should recognize that instead of calling her out on this thread of all places!<br /><br />Don&#039;t listen to him yuna! It was and is a great thing what you did.

				Hello there everyone :)&nbsp; &nbsp;Just popped in to say hi and see what&#039;s up.&nbsp; Probably no one around.&nbsp; I know... I keep strange hours - pretty much of a night owl.&nbsp; Ah well...&nbsp; &nbsp;been reading through the past few pages here... and noticed a new lady here...&nbsp; Bunny?&nbsp; Welcome and I, like you had no idea that there were this many females on SR.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know why it comes as such as a surprise...&nbsp; guess it&#039;s that everyone calls each other (as well as me...&nbsp; at least they did until recently) bro, dude, man, sir, etc....&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I got the feeling that SR is made up of mostly guys.&nbsp; I suppose it probably is...&nbsp; but anyway, I was happy to have found this thread.&nbsp; And some good people on here too...&nbsp; &nbsp;not counting the [most likely male] trolls such as munchies and someone else I forget their name but who&#039;s almost as annoying....<br /><br />Anyway, I got a question.&nbsp; At the risk of sounding like an idiot (which I&#039;m not except when it comes to things I&#039;m unfamiliar with)..&nbsp; I asked the same question the other day and a couple of people answered....&nbsp; but, I&#039;m still confused!&nbsp; ???&nbsp; &nbsp; O.K. every day it seems like more and more people are talking about chatting on IRC and tbh, until these past few days, I&#039;ve never had an interest in getting on there...&nbsp; about the ONLY thing I know about it is that it&#039;s an Internet Relay Chat - not terribly helpful information.&nbsp; Especially when I don&#039;t have any idea how to even get there.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been told of two channels:&nbsp; #public which supposedly is for newbies and trolls.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;m no troll...&nbsp; but obviously when it comes to IRC I&#039;d probably fit the &quot;newbie&quot; label - embarassing as that is - considering that even if I figured out how to get to IRC in the first place...&nbsp; finding a room...&nbsp; I&#039;d be totally lost!&nbsp; Until I&#039;d been there I guess..&nbsp; Anyway, I was also told of another room... #cheers, which I think is the one that people on here have been talking about and is by invitation only.&nbsp; Although something I read in someone&#039;s post earlier...&nbsp; I wonder if there is not a different one that is the one people here are talking about.&nbsp; I was told though that to get an invite to #cheers you just have to know someone who has one.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;m pretty sure that I know several people who have one... and if that&#039;s the place you all are talking about, well, if no one minds..&nbsp; I&#039;d kind of like to check it out.&nbsp; I think if someone would just be kind enough to point me in the right direction and give me a couple of hints or something...&nbsp; then I&#039;d probably be able to figure it out from there and I would like to at least see if it&#039;s something I might enjoy.&nbsp; If not, then no harm done... I just don&#039;t go back.. right?<br /><br />So....&nbsp; any info or whatnot in simple terms would be most appreciated...&nbsp; if you gals are all O.K. with it of course....<br /><br />Until next time... take care everyone and enjoy your day/night ;)<br /><br />foxen...

I dont use IRC, but in there would be legit to have area where guys and girls of SR can talk and Girls-only private area(I think it would be appropriate to have men their own are if they wish). I dont mind guys around here&nbsp; ;) it&#039;s nice :), even though (i think) original idea was to get women here in touch with each other.

				It was over ambitious.&nbsp; I&#039;ve just had this debate way too much.&nbsp; It seems to be a trend one side doesn&#039;t fully understand the other on the whole monogamy thing and it&#039;s aggravating when one tries to show who is right.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to stir stuff up in your thread.&nbsp; I just got snippy when I heard that tired old statement I highlighted, that is spouted when people give up on talking about this issue.&nbsp;

				GIRL THREAD!?!!! YAYY!!!!<br />Hello my lovely SR ladies (and naughty gents) xx<br />&nbsp;<br />Sorry to hear things didn&#039;t work out with your fiance, Defy :( I used to feel kinda like you... I thought cheating would absolutely be the end of it. That if i was going to be your girlfriend then i needed to be the ONLY object of your desire forever. period. Cheating was the ultimate betrayal and unforgivable. it took me a while but eventually i realized that&#039;s not realistic, that we are only human and that we can still be attracted to other people regardless of if we&#039;re in a monogamous relationship or not. So, really, all that matters is whether or not we choose to act on our natural instincts or follow the (relatively) new rules of what it means to be in a relationship with someone... and in the end we&#039;ll all just do what makes us feel better: having sex or having a clear conscious. <br /><br />OR, we can have both :D ...<br />Now, Zipstyle has called me a heathen for feeling like this (also, SS called me an incorrigible minx once, but that&#039;s a little beside the point, just thought I would mention it since he is in here :P) and Zip may be right becausssse i believe we can be in a strong, healthy, loving relationship while engaging in extramarital affairs... for the sake of human connection (and having fun, of course). To truly pull this off I think it takes two open-minded, very secure people who are deeply in love and have been for a while. They can sense their partner&#039;s needs, are able to voice their own, and know how to communicate productively and lovingly. Probably most of us (me) don&#039;t have what it takes because of social mores, religious values and silly stuff like that :P <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206797.msg1515987#msg1515987">Quote from: DefyCode on September 04, 2013, 06:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Are you saying I should&#039;ve considered not leaving him because of his honesty? That perhaps his honesty made him a keeper in-spite of his dick being inside another vagina less than 90 days before our wedding?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />well when you put it that way my best advice is this:<br />Step 1) dig your keys into the side of his pretty, little, souped-up 4WD<br />Step 2) carve your name into his leather seats<br />Step 3) take a Louisville slugger to both headlights<br />Step 4) slash a hole in all 4 tires<br />Maybe next time he&#039;ll think before he cheats.<br /><br />Also, weed is fucking awesome and war sucks. Let&#039;s all toke and blow smoke in the face of these aggressors before they get too trigger-happy. Calm those fuckers down.<br />

				@defycode Ugh girl that is some bullshit..fuck cheaters. In my experience, when you find out that you have been cheated on, it changes your perception of the person. It isnt one of those things you can just brush aside. And it hurts like hell.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyhow good morning everyone!<br /><br />&nbsp;I did NOT sleep well.

				I agree with TrashBox that open minded people can have extramarital affairs. Only thing that is important is talking - like she mentioned. If someone isn&#039;t up to it, it&#039;s better to split up so that both have chance to look for relationship they wish. Cheaters are in their own category since they dont understand the communication as basics of relationship.<br /><br />Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you TrashBox :).

				@defycode I believe that some websites do that, especially with items that are reordered monthly, drugstore is the one I am thinking. Diapers and soap are sister sites that do it with baby stuff and household items as well..<br /><br />Another day hanging here, no drama on the menu, but that can change with the doorbell. I hope like hell not, the ppl I do not like live like a 30-45 min drive away, so that should be sufficient to keep them away..hopefully. ugh<br /><br />Anyhow cleaning, organizing, need to go through stuff and get rid of stuff that we dont use..I am bad about it, because I prefer to sell things, so then I end up sitting around with all this stuff I am ready to get rid of..usually it does sell though, so I can not complain..I am ocd about things having all their parts, and being clean, so usually its like new..that helps on the selling front.<br /><br />Hope everyone has a peaceful Sunday!

That wouldn&#039;t make sense because that would just basically be the regular SR Forums, where everyone is already accepted and welcomed (except LE). <br /><br />This thread is simply a &quot;niche&quot; thread, where us girls on SR can talk, meet, bullshit, whatever! We aren&#039;t attempting to create a separate culture or &quot;divide&quot; SR, we simply identified something that ALREADY existed! This thread didn&#039;t spontaneously create females on SR, but is certainly united us, and I would say improved the overall feel of &quot;community&quot; for all of Silk Road. Are the SR Forums in anyway worse because of this thread? I don&#039;t think so, and I think most would agree with me. This leaves only one alternative, that the SR Forums are in fact better because of this thread.<br /><br />Chevelle, your argument has been rendered invalid. C&#039;est la vie!<br /><br />-xoxo

				It was so quiet here yesterday and suddenly there is lot of conversation. It appears im sleeping in my country when others are having morning :P.<br /><br />There has again been someone(chevelle) who is disappointed females gathering together. Many of this thread have joined other threads and conversations(for example Official Spare Coins Thread&nbsp; has been popular) so it shouldn&#039;t be problem if females want to have ladies -only-talk sometimes. And if i remember correctly, DefyCode mentioned in starting post that females can get female oriented advices here if needed. And she actually mentioned lot of good points in her latest post so i dont need to add anything.<br /><br />I saw Miss Sexy Boots in some other threads earlier so it&#039;s nice she joined here as well. And TrashBox has been active also - she seems fun person ;D.<br /><br />I dont know what time of the day others have, but good morning to all and hugs from me&nbsp; :)<br />

				Regarding segregation, cliques, whatever etcetera...<br /><br />How is having a thread where women are encouraged to visit a bad thing? Picture this:<br /><br />I&#039;m a woman (I&#039;m not, but go with me). I take a drug of some sort. The next morning, I have a blue menstrual cycle... I&#039;m like &#039;WTF!11!1!&#039;. I go to a number of threads: &quot;Help!&quot; I cry &quot;I&#039;m bleeding blue shit out of my vag!&quot;. Everyone else is like &quot;Lady, I&#039;m a dude... how the fuck should I know what to do?&quot;. Now, even though there ARE females in this forum, I have no idea where to find them... suddenly &#039;Official Ladies of S/R Thread&#039; pops up. Wow! I actually CAN find women here, and it&#039;s not that hard... &quot;Help me!&quot; I cry again, &quot;My period is blue!&quot;. Before I know it, some kind woman says &quot;hold it partner. I did that drug before. It&#039;s only the dye they use in it... don&#039;t sweat&quot;. The conclusion? I walk away happy, no longer worried that my time of the month looks like I&#039;ve been having illicit encounters with papa smurf, and continue using the forum happily.<br /><br />This thread doesn&#039;t exclude others. I&#039;m living proof of that (having a cock &amp; balls, y&#039;know). It simply says to women &quot;Hey, there are other women here&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same as if there were a &#039;Muslim&#039; thread, or a &#039;We&#039;re all black&#039; thread. It doesn&#039;t matter what kinds of thread there are - as long as they&#039;re not called things like &#039;The Muslim &#039;We&#039;re Gonna Bomb You&#039; Thread&#039;, or the &#039;Black Folk Hate Whites&#039; thread, and as long as others know they are welcome... what&#039;s the harm in being able to identify with others that hold similar physical properties or belief systems?<br /><br />Just sayin&#039;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206797.msg1525324#msg1525324">Quote from: cryngie on September 09, 2013, 02:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wait defycode your claiming there were girls/women/females on SR BEFORE this thread?

				You have a point about the different country threads. I admit that. Law change from country to country and that should be addressed. The point I was trying to make there was more of an &quot;Americans Suck!&quot; or an &quot;Aussies Suck!&quot; kind of thing.<br /><br />I did notice that you failed to address my point about menstruation.

The point about menstruation was not a defense in its own right, rather it was an example of a concept - the concept of women seeking advice from other women, and knowing where to find them. I incorrectly assumed you had realised that. But if you do wish this point to be addressed, then I&#039;ll concede that men may well know about menstruation, but I&#039;ll also hasten to add that as a general rule, it would be easier to find menstruation advice from a thread predominantly populated with female members than it would in a thread predominantly populated with male members. Not because &#039;no men know about menstruation&#039; - many will - but more because &#039;women are more likely to know about menstruation&#039;.<br /><br />Hopefully you capisce.

				Well put. But once again, where does the segregation end? I understand that this is well intentioned, but it is still what it is. If you can justify a Women&#039;s thread, you can justify anything that divides the road, is the point I&#039;m trying to make. Maybe I&#039;m just looking for a fight.

Do tell what this other &quot;BS&quot; that we are justifying is?<br /><br />This is similar to the logical chain that a Saudi Arabian cleric presented when he said that allowing women to drive would turn Saudi men gay and eliminate the existence of virgins. (CLEARNET REFERENCE: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2068810/Saudis-fear-virgins-people-turn-gay-female-drive-ban-lifted.html)<br /><br />Also, segregation by definition (the negative variant you are using): <br /><br />&quot;the enforced separation of different racial groups in a [forum], country, community, or establishment.&quot;<br /><br />There is no advocacy of segregation here, and this is certainly not a feminist thread (we like and do welcome nice men to hang out). Other genders (transgendered ppl included), countries, sexual deviants (there is a CP thread), drug fanatics, racists (which there are several) are all welcome to start their own thread. Will they be as successful as this thread or the Australian thread? Mmm...odds are that they won&#039;t be, but alas, it is the people of the SR Forum who ultimately validate the value of any new thread. If people do not like a thread, they generally will make one negative comment on the thread and go on to do better things. Those who do like the thread and get value from it, inherently participate and enjoy the community that derives from such activity. This is similar to a free market model, but instead of with their wallets, the community votes with their keyboard and mouse. <br /><br />This is also equivalent to you saying that iPhones are a waste money and will lead to Armageddon and are are a bad idea to begin with...Apple&#039;s bottom line would emphatically disagree, just like 100% of the females and 100% of the men (minus you) disagree with you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pile on the negative karma...idiots.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Clearly the best thing to say when engaged in a lopsided debate. <br /><br />You can choose to continue on your rant against this thread knowing you will have zero chance of bringing people to your side of the argument, or you could move on to other areas of the SR forum which are more to your liking, OOOOOR you could even contribute to this thread in a more meaningful way (ie You could ask us what our favorite colors are....mine is green).<br /><br />You&#039;ll do one of those three things, let&#039;s see which. ;)<br /><br />@PPANTH:<br /><br />That is a relief honey, definitely keep us posted. You&#039;re in our prayers!<br /><br />@findingthecure:<br /><br />I never knew about blueish secretion, that would be very worrisome to me, but glad to know it doesnt merit an ER visit if it ever does happen. :( <br /><br /><br />**Hugs to all** (except chevelle, lol)

				This argument has nothing to do with me, but i just want to point out that all ladies of Silk Road doesn&#039;t take part of this thread. Neither all Australians take part of their thread. It&#039;s free choice. Those who want to gather are free to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />In your point of view it&#039;s either their way or your way. Doesn&#039;t that cause division as well? <br /><br />So piece of an advice: Instead of controlling company you&#039;re in, i would rather choose it.<br /><br />And if that doesn&#039;t comfort remember that the basic reason to be here is pretty much the same for everyone and that keeps people together. <br /><br />Sry for party crashing

I know these are well known, but i still hadn&#039;t seen them before. <br />The Saw series was good, my type, but acting was bit bad.<br />What horror movies you have seen and is there any favorite or horror type?

I just were afraid to mention since i knew their reputation&nbsp; :P.&nbsp; I agree completely with you that the first film was exactly what it promised but second wasn&#039;t that good. <br /><br />I kinda feel that in the first one the antagonist was professional and knew what he was doing, making it interesting, but in the second one it was someone playing god without actual knowledge. This was something that bothered me.<br /><br />If someone looks for gore The Human Centipede is good, but i put strong warning to second one. Very strong warning. Even though it&#039;s black and white it definitely doesn&#039;t fit for sensible people. It&#039;s gore, sadistic and psychologically disturbing. I didn&#039;t get permanent traumas though&nbsp; :P ,but didn&#039;t watch second time either.<br /><br />Thanks for putting that in the list incubusdriver. I like gore&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />And good night/evening mary666(im not sure what time in your country is&nbsp; :P)

I haven&#039;t played the game, but i have watched play through and it was awesome. And movie... Acting again wasn&#039;t best(my opinion), and it&#039;s not extreme horror, but for some reason i liked it overall. I have it &lt;3. And soundtracks for all games are just divine.<br /><br />If i watched correct movie(Ghost Ship) it wasn&#039;t bad. A small hint of Silent Hill atmosphere, but there weren&#039;t excessive amount of jump scares or slasher, gore or such. Little yes.<br /><br />Ok, so i still have The Conjuring and Sinister. And maybe i watch The Human Centipede 1 again if i feel like it. And Silent Hill 1 movie &lt;3 i have been saving it for special moment. I cant remember sure have i watched newer ones - need to check ;D.<br /><br />I wonder what movie you mary666 mean - never heard myself.<br />Edit: Or do you mean A Serbian Film? I found that.<br /><br />I think many girls are busy IRL especially Defy. That&#039;s why they are not as often around. <br /><br />Good Friday to all from me too &lt;3 be safe&nbsp; :P

You can fill this thread up with anything you want to get out, we&#039;re a family here (wink @ chemcat).<br /><br />I&#039;ve been blonde, and recently had black hair, now I&#039;m back to a dark brunette. I usually switch it up every year.<br /><br />Being a vendor...well...here it goes:<br />I&#039;m still a &quot;new vendor&quot; being just over a month into my SR business. As of right now I am profitable (even if I wouldn&#039;t get the bond back). Profit is still not where I would need it to be to make it my full-time job, but I think eventually I can get there (not sure if I want this full time though).<br />Things learned:<br />1. In SR, reputation carries a lot of weight.<br />2. In the beginning you should plan to essentially lose money (aka free samples w/free shipping)<br />3. Don&#039;t make a legal product your &quot;main&quot; product. (I&#039;ve discontinued open sales of capsules, ppl can still get them via PM request).<br />4. Communicate everything with your clients (I recently fucked up ordering my capsules from my supplier and was unable to fulfill an order, I offered a full refund and a reship when the right size did come in)<br />5. Be coachable. The guys in IRC are crazy and sometimes dumb (like any congregation of guys IRL) but they are very nice and offer quality advice if you ask for it.<br />6. Use pre-commission pricing (didnt understand why I was getting less BTC than what I posted for until a few days ago)<br />7. Use free shipping domestically (just inflate your list price by your shipping costs) it looks nicer<br />8. Shipping = postage + stealth costs<br />9. People will try to randomly scam you (even if they&#039;ve never been a customer)<br />10. Never require FE, but if they want to, allow them to.<br />11. Have your entire logistics chain ready before posting (ie, inventory control, packaging supplies, postage, etc)<br />12. International orders are a pain.<br /><br />And I think that covers it. Overall it has been an enjoyable experience and I&#039;ve learned a lot from it. I recommend it if you have a good IRL connect that can supply you steadily. As far as reselling from here, that is definitely an idea and you certainly can make money that way without having to have a vendor account here. Just be sure that your SR suppliers use good stealth so that YOU don&#039;t get CD&#039;d or anything.<br /><br />And I have made it past my week mark of being coke free, my sleep hours are pretty much normal now, I get sleepy around 10 and have to be in bed by midnight. Thank you all for your support and love!<br /><br />*Hugs*

And im still wishing luck to you with getting coke-free&nbsp; 8) It&#039;s good that you haven&#039;t had problems with that so far :-*.<br /><br />I can see many have lot of hair dying experience. I really haven&#039;t done it much because i&#039;m very fond of my natural color&nbsp; :P. <br /><br />Mary asked about weed smoking. I cant really use anything regularly, but here and then. It&#039;s something in my personality. <br /><br />I have continued the research of my own health and have found Adrenal Fatigue, Hypothyroidism, Hyperthyroidism and this type of things and have decided to find private doctor (that&#039;s why im in need of money&nbsp; :P - i cant do work at the moment) to see could my problems be caused by these. Any one experienced? <br /><br />Any way it&#039;s nice to see everyone still around here ;D.<br /><br /><br />

				Hi gals!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been swamped IRL with a bunch of randomness to say the least, I&#039;ve neglected my SR ladies and for that I am Sorry! :)<br /><br />@incubus: Congrats on finally becoming a vendor! I&#039;m so happy for your! I bet you&#039;re gonna get rich super fast with your slick copy. You&#039;ll be the richest midget in all of Europe!<br /><br />@ppanth: Ugh, doll, at least you&#039;re still alive! You&#039;ve been going through quite a bit these last few weeks. I know you&#039;ll get through it eventually because 1. You&#039;re ppanth and 2. You&#039;re a Fembot 3. You&#039;re an official lady of SR! :D :D<br /><br />@mary666: *hugs* to you mother of SR! You always sound so happy, I love it! Is it weird that I think in a scottish accent whenever I read your text? lol I&#039;m a weirdo... <br /><br />@foxen: don&#039;t be a stranger girlie! <br /><br />@findingthecure: Thanks for the support hun and I hope you get your health figured out soon. Unfortunately I&#039;m no doctor to be able to give any thoughts on what&#039;s affecting you.<br /><br />@Remediless: Thanks! I appreciate that, honestly it has been all due to the modafinil/baclofen mixture, it really just kills the cravings for me. Without that I may have already slipped back.<br /><br />XOXOXOX<br /><br />Love you all,<br /><br />DC

				@Defycode..ah, daughter :) I&#039;m glad your doing good hun, I had a modafinil myself today, glad it&#039;s helping you.I forgot I&#039;d had one lol&nbsp; It never stopped me getting ripped on honeycomb this morning, 1st time trying, yummy :)<br />&nbsp;Questions:Do you have to pay for your prescription and how much do they cost, does it depend on what it is? I&#039;m curious as to how the US prescription price works, we are all free in the UK now :) **Hugs you tightly** mary666 :)

				There are so many variables about health care in the US.&nbsp; If you have insurance, it depends on what kind you have, but there will always be a copay ~$5-$50.&nbsp; Depends on the prescription as well.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t it&#039;s going to cost a lot.&nbsp; $50-$100&#039;s&nbsp; I&#039;ve never really had a scrip so I can&#039;t say much or with accuracy.&nbsp; I stick to alternatives.<br /><br />However, obama care is going to change a lot, but it&#039;s too soon to say what that will be.<br /><br />I agree there needs to be health care reform, but our government is the last person I want to do this.

They&#039;ve been stopped by customs twice but it only delayed the product and they were sent on as it&#039;s not illegal in the UK yet! Can you buy Modafinil in the US or script only? :)

				Hi to everyone&nbsp; :) Ladies and Gentlemen<br /><br />I just were in private laboratory to give blood test for thyroid gland function examination. It sure does cost a lot (189.55 $ and i couldn&#039;t even afford to everything i wanted to test), but i hope it&#039;s worth it. Service was really good though.<br /><br />I just made bit of research out boredom and found out that Modafinil in my country costs(legal way) 406.17$ from package of 90 pills and it needs special license since it&#039;s not usually prescribed here to anything. Expensive stuff. What kind of heath care you have in there US?<br /><br />Congrats to incubusdriver from my part as well. Nice idea for business. Even though this is not directly about your stuff, but i once wanted to be novelist/writer, until i understood it&#039;s not my path :P. I still have 2 and half full scripts that are fun to read.<br /><br />Good to know that you have experience BoxofShapes. I guess you have Adrenal Fatigue based on iodine you mentioned. I dont know how old you are, but do you mean that before getting help, you have your whole life before that felt &quot;sick&quot;?<br /><br />And Defy, you look &quot;fresh&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Fun Friday for&nbsp; DefyCode&nbsp; 8), incubusdriver&nbsp; ;D, BoxofShapes :D, mary666&nbsp; ;), ppanth :), foxen624&nbsp; :), Remediless ;) and all the others who happen to read this(dont think anything too serious from smiley faces, i was just having fun ;D).<br /><br />&nbsp;:-*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Congrats on becoming a vendor @incubusdriver!<br /><br />@defycode Um yes the bullshit is at a non stop here..or so it seems..finally got to read the police report and found out that there may also be a possession charge on the way..who knows..he does have a lawyer tho so..that helps..he has put his family on a leash and it is calm for the most part..altho his crazy mother called him last week and was babbling that I almost killed her..LMAO..a day after telling me she was complimenting me on how wonderful the kids are..so ya know crazy is crazy..I say just ignore. If not for the seriousness of the history that she is responsible for I would let it go and be ok with them being around more..but yea...I am still highly pissed if I give it too much thought...I am glad it sounds that you are busy and all is well!!!<br /><br />@mary HI!! hugs!!<br /><br />@findingcure..geesh I sure hope you are feeling better soon..<br /><br />I am lucky I have insurance, and pretty damn good insurance at that..the most expensive co pay I pay for suboxone is 17 bucks...so having to buy it here is like omfg..testing and anything else would be co pay of nothing if I go to a military base. If they stocked sub I could have it filled on base for free..but I am more then ok paying the 17..otherwise I have 20% co pay at the drs and 150 deductible.<br /><br />Anywho ..hello to anyone I missed..I shall be around...I think..&lt;3 to all!!

Seriously, coke and meth are my DOC&#039;s but I know they make me fucking crazy.

But, that last bit is neither here nor there.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTW, sorry for the long and rambling reply here.. something about the subject just seemed to unleash these little things and once I started writing... well...&nbsp; sorry.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ll try again to address the main issue.&nbsp; I tried to when I was trying to explain about that I&#039;ve spent a lot more time around guys IRL than women.. and staying on that topic now, I want to say that the reason I said earlier in this post/reply that I have to disagree that men handle these things better... is because back in the days when I did a lot of coke, it was usually me (sometimes one or two other females) and a bunch of guys.&nbsp; And almost inevitably, it would be me and/or me and the other female(s) who would wind up having to &quot;babysit&quot; the guys.. especially the later it got.. as after a while, they would usually start to get loud.. and louder... and sometimes start to get aggressive and try to start fights..&nbsp; sometimes physical fights..&nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost always the out numbered females who would calm them down, keep on them to keep their voices down, etc....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And with the meth.. although I said (and meant and mean) that it&#039;s like a totally different drug imo, it was still the guys who would get out of hand (not all of them, usually the same ones though).&nbsp; Meth has a tendency in some people to apparently feel a strong need to constantly peek out the window.&nbsp; This gets extremely embarrassing as well as dangerous (ie... cops possibly driving by and seeing people parting the blinds at night with lights on inside and peeking out)... especially when it was (not so much anymore as I no longer hang out with a lot of people) more often than not, my place that they would do this.&nbsp; Omg... I&#039;ll never forget this one guy who had this peeking out in paranoia syndrome so bad, that one time, I caught him standing on a chair in my kitchen at night with the lights on - with a pair of binoculars stuck between the mini-blinds that he was looking though! (I know, it&#039;s pretty funny to remember that long after the fact).. but at the time, I got so mad at him - threw him out told him not to ever come back until he could control his urge to peer outside with or w/o the binocs... then I told everyone else that if I ever caught anyone from that point on parting the blinds...&nbsp; they were not welcome back.&nbsp; They did improve.. or resist that urge that I personally never have had or really understand... but anyway, I never once caught a woman either peeking outside, raising her voice to unreasonable levels or trying to start fights...&nbsp; only the guys.&nbsp; &nbsp;Though to be fair, there were more guys who acted perfectly fine than there were who got out of hand....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Still, most of the guys I&#039;ve been around in various cities and states I&#039;ve lived in, have basically the same story to tell...&nbsp; &nbsp;about some girl who did some meth then was suddenly begging all the guys for sex and writhing around on the floor.&nbsp; ???&nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmmm...&nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow, I think that maybe someone at one time spoke of his fantasy out loud as if it were a reality, and it was repeated over and over so that so many guys all in different parts of the country had almost the same exact story to tell that supposedly happened to them...&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve not been around every person (obviously) or even close who does meth, but from those I&#039;ve seen/been around...&nbsp; I&#039;ve not once seen any woman have a reaction that even resembled the widely told story.. and I&#039;ve certainly never experienced such a reaction.&nbsp; &nbsp;So....&nbsp; &nbsp;if anyone made it through all the ramble...&nbsp; &nbsp;that is my 2+ bitcoins on the subject...&nbsp; :o :P<br /><br />@Defy - you have a great inner strength to have gone cold turkey like you did... by yourself (I know you&#039;ve had support at least from SR).. but still, I quite honestly have to say that if a time ever comes that I either want to or have to quit the meth..&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m quite sure that I&#039;d totally fall apart and just wanted to let you know that your strength and resolve don&#039;t go unnoticed around here...&nbsp; I wish you all the best and believe that you will have it :)&nbsp; :-*

I&#039;m sure it happens...somewhere. My experience with guys on drugs has been limited, I have only seen a couple of guys on coke and they were more in control than me and the rest I&#039;ve seen guys on weed or molly and that is it. I&#039;ve never knowingly seen someone on meth.<br /><br />And thank you for the encouragement foxen but I am certainly not doing it alone. I live with my best friend and she has done a lot to keep me in check and honestly was the one to really make me realize how my coke habit was on the verge of destroying me. Secondly, it was actually Mary666 who told me about using modafinil to curb coke cravings; I went to the doctor, per her suggestion, and was prescribed modafinil and baclofen (a muscle relaxer that helps with withdrawal symptoms); and lastly, as you said, I have all of my SR family cheering me on. Alone, without my IRL bestie, without the scrips, without ALL of you I most certainly would have already fell back in to my white powdery abyss.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is overdue, but THANK YOU! All of you! I won&#039;t say names because I probably will leave one out accidentally. I love you all! *SUPER HUGS*<br /><br />-xoxo

				Hi everyone<br /><br />You really gave it way foxen624&nbsp; ;D nice post. Very interesting perspective with experience. I cant really say are men or women more &quot;crazier&quot; in drugs since i dont have that much experience. I personally would expect it to depend on personality and other stuff. I couple of times tried to take ecstasy, when i was feeling really bad and it really didnt do anything to me. Some people tell stories about making bad decisions on it and behaving totally different, but i cant recall such from my experience. <br /><br />I would like to throw a question as well. Now, i dont have much experience with drugs, since the main purpose was to find alternative medication or &quot;curing&quot; methods to my health. Many of you already know this.<br />However, if i get my health better, what drug, stimulant or relaxant(preferably both), i should give a try at least once(im not the type of using regularly). <br />So simply, if someone wants to spend pleasurable day, evening, or night on something, what would it be? And what amount of that substance is good for female/small person(that&#039;s extra question)?<br /><br />Nice to meet you gn0ssos from my part as well.<br />*hugs* +&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; :-* to all&nbsp; :)

Honestly I find that I tend to like the harder ones best, so it&#039;s hard to really recommend those. I guess I&#039;ll just tell you my favorites and you can decide for yourself. With downers, I think my favorites would have to be Fentanyl, Roxys, Dilaudeds and liquid Morphine. I found that all those suited me better even than H. With uppers, don&#039;t even get me started... hah. That&#039;s what we were just talking about. If I were to recommend something a bit more mild to someone who doesn&#039;t do drugs much and just wants to experiment, I&#039;d probably recommend Adderall or some other pharmaceutical stimulant.<br /><br />Oh and on a side note: I&#039;m not necessarily recommending Fent if you&#039;re not a big user. It&#039;s many times stronger than morphine and is better for heavier users. I&#039;m just sharing my favorites.

I microdose LSD (about 50ug or half an average blotter) every so often and it brightens my day, makes me really socially and cheery. It&#039;s also non-toxic, so you don&#039;t need to worry about your liver or heart or bladder. There is a tolerance, but it can be avoided by taking a few days off.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also microdosed ketamine (a small bump) in the morning to life my mood, it also has stimulant effects in low doses.<br /><br />For special occasions I love MDMA. The clean stuff will have you feeling great, if not a tad sweaty. But it&#039;s a nice social drug and a good experience to share with others.<br /><br />My DOC is coke, but I only mess with it if it&#039;s upwards of 70% and even then I limit it to weekends, but it is quite a treat, maybe a special occasion drug. I always have some with me.<br /><br />I think the key is to get very high quality of whatever it is you want to try. The negative side effects are often from adulterants and other shit. Like staying up all night and being crazy doesn&#039;t usually happen on very good coke, neither does taking a bump every thirty seconds. <br /><br />I also would recommend playing around with microdoses of drugs. A lot of them are totally different animals when your goal isn&#039;t to get unbelievably fucked up.<br /><br />For downers, I think opium is pretty good, especially smoked, as you get the rush. That would be a special occasion thing too, obviously, as we know opiates are highly addictive. <br />

				Good evening/night ladies and gentlemen&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Thanks for all suggestion so far. Everyone so far has given really good explanations of their favorite stuff +1<br />Keep them coming. I would like to hear others opinion as well :)<br /><br />incubusdriver: I myself really wondered the 2C drugs and what they are before, when i saw the category in SR. Thanks for explanation and experience.<br /><br />gn0ssos: I understand where you are going with saying that your favorites are more for heavier users. Glad you still told your favorites and added Adderall.<br /><br />titoprince:You have an amazing list of suggestions.<br />And i love your avatar &lt;3 purrrr<br /><br />One other question popped in my mind from titoprince&#039;s list, that im very curious to know answer. Is it safe to take &quot;once&quot; highly addictive, or in commons language, &quot;dangerous&quot; drug such coke, heroin, meth etc. without getting addiction or negative effects(im pretty sure answer is yes, but since i have actual opportunity to ask pros, i would like to hear it from them).<br /><br />I wish you still keep my first question in mind as well&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Love you all&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; :-* :-*

There is a tolerance, but it can be avoided by taking a few days off.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also microdosed ketamine (a small bump) in the morning to life my mood, it also has stimulant effects in low doses.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Top of my list of things to try out.<br /><br />The only thing I have to contribute on this is GHB.&nbsp; I loved this stuff in small samples.&nbsp; Not enough to hinder but still felt breezy.&nbsp; Perfect for the tail end of almost anything.&nbsp; Brought it out a couple times when a few were over and broke everyone&#039;s preconceived notions.&nbsp; People can totally disagree on this though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have anyone to suggest to get this from cause the guy who had the best is MIA/KIA.&nbsp; Just stating my experience.

				Hi Gals and Guys&nbsp; :D<br /><br />@findingcure.. Hey hun&nbsp; :) Sorry, I didn&#039;t suggest a drug as I would find it hard to chose drugs for you. I&#039;ve found out in life that what I like isn&#039;t necessarily what someone else enjoys. One of my friends doesn&#039;t like weed, another one would never touch acid but will happily partake in a line of coke or speed, the thought of even DMT terrifies them, I think it depends what your looking for and what you feel comfortable taking.&nbsp; :-\ <br />On the hard drugs front, I&#039;ve tried Heroin a few times when I was young. I took it over a 3-4 day period and felt like I&#039;d been to the gym, all sore for the few days that followed so I&#039;d have to say if your going to try it just try it the once. I was never a fan of H, it was kind of how it looked, sitting gouching&nbsp; ::) wasn&#039;t fun at all and you&#039;ll probably be sick&nbsp; ;)<br />I tried crack on 2 separate occasions and found it to be very likeable&nbsp; :D wouldn&#039;t do it now but I&#039;d really wanted to try it at the time and I&#039;m glad I did.<br />A while ago I really wanted to order some Meth to try but was really advised against it by a few people here. I trust these people so I&#039;m not going to bother with it and tbh after watching a few Meth addict films I can see why! ;) <br />I hope this helps a bit, I&#039;m sure you know what you can handle but please be careful with the harder drugs if you decide to sample hun&nbsp; ;) :-*<br /><br />**hugs for everybody**

Is it safe to take &quot;once&quot; highly addictive, or in commons language, &quot;dangerous&quot; drug such coke, heroin, meth etc. without getting addiction or negative effects(im pretty sure answer is yes, but since i have actual opportunity to ask pros, i would like to hear it from them).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve never tried H, but I&#039;ve used other hard drugs as a one-off and been fine - for example, I&#039;ve used cocaine like twice in my life, and seriously enjoyed but never craved it. So I&#039;d say it&#039;s very possible to try a highly addictive drug once and not get addicted. However, I know only too well that it&#039;s very easy to justify going from &#039;once&#039; to &#039;once in a while&#039;, from &#039;once in a while&#039; to &#039;only at weekends&#039;, then from &#039;only at weekends&#039; to &#039;give me my fucking fix or I&#039;ll bite your nose off!&#039;.<br /><br />I have a lot of vices and addictions (not necessarily of the chemical variety), and I know that none of them would have turned that way if I had stopped at &#039;just once&#039;.

				I would say good, relatively pure 70% coke is not really &quot;addictive&quot; in the chemical sense of the word.&nbsp; What it can become is habit forming. The reason is that is really wakes you up and ultra focused (I know for some people it does not have this precise effect) but for me when I started taking it I REALLY loved it after the first time. Then I was like...&quot;what if I take it when I wake up?&quot; and boom it was awesome for me and then I kept doing it and eventually I NEEDED to take it or I would not be able to function. So with coke you should be okay just trying it once or even a couple of times, just try like 500mg or 250mg&nbsp; and you&#039;ll feel the &quot;upper effect&quot; really quick and tah dah! <br /><br />I recommend it as a good &quot;every once in a while drug&quot; it is far too awesome and spendy to do daily.<br /><br />And AGREED about coffee! Even when I was a certifiable coke-head I drank coffee all the time! (KONA BEANS ALL THE WAY!)<br /><br />-xoxo

				What an amazing, amazing thread!&nbsp; Thank you ladies, and the occasional dick, er, um, I mean gent.<br /><br />I am, unfortunately vaginally deprived (from a personal bodily sense).<br /><br />May I share my story with you?&nbsp; Of course, that&#039;s a prelude to... &quot;Hey y&#039;all, here&#039;s my story whether you like it or not!&quot;<br /><br />I think it&#039;s even maybe just a little bit pertinent to this thread.<br /><br />I find family here, as many of you have said.&nbsp; I find warmth, and caring.<br /><br />In a bunch of drugged out life-wasters.&nbsp; Oh my word, how can it be (please understand, I don&#039;t really mean that!)<br /><br />I grew up in the 60s and 70s in a very religious home.&nbsp; I never tasted alcohol until late 20s and never did anything, pot, ANYTHING until a few years ago.<br /><br />I bought the lies.&nbsp; I believed that only evil could possibly befall.&nbsp; There was a godless, lifeless world in the people who were interested in substances.<br /><br />Enter my wonderful, amazing wife.&nbsp; She took on a broken man and a broken family and brought life to all of us.&nbsp; And lived in those same 60s and 70s in a very different way.<br /><br />Funny thing, in my abstinence, I built a raging interest in things intoxicating.&nbsp; They had (still have) a strong sexual/sensual overtone.<br /><br />We discovered the Road in an effort to obtain medical weed, which is vital to her, though we&#039;re not in a medical area.&nbsp; Once there, we talked about some of my other interests (ok, drug fetishes).&nbsp; <br /><br />She loves the stimulants, so we tried coke.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t as great for me as for her, but I am finding that if I relax and let go, it&#039;s a wonderful once-in-a-while.&nbsp; She had loved it in her youth as well.<br /><br />We love 2C-B together.&nbsp; She admits to the nastiest and most incredible fantasies on it.&nbsp; And GHB is pure heaven in small amounts for our love times.<br /><br />And this... to find here a wonderful community of caring people.&nbsp; Substance users who help each other through kicking things that aren&#039;t helping them.&nbsp; Who loan money and get it back.<br /><br />I have lost none of my religion.&nbsp; I have not burned through all my money.&nbsp; I am not a raving sexual fiend ... well ... not most of the time.<br /><br />Instead, I have found a community I share with her (I have more free time right now).<br /><br />Honestly ... it&#039;s utopian, I know, but this community might just make a real difference in our restricted, painful society.<br /><br />And honestly as well, I&#039;m completely straight as I write this!!&nbsp; I just always am like this.

				Night everyone&nbsp; :)<br /><br />How is everyone doing&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />ppanth and BoxofShapes: Weed is a classic and good choice. Does it matter what strain? And coffee...my every morning companion :D<br /><br />Thank you for experience DefyCode as well. I know for sure you know what you are talking about. Especially those amounts +1<br /><br />And Mary666&nbsp; :) awesome as always. I have heard lot about Meth as well and seen documents. That&#039;s how i also became curious about it? Then again, If person knows that one dose of certain drug can cause permanent or difficult addiction would he/she try it?<br /><br />incubusdriver: Thanks for confirming my thoughts and giving your own experience :).<br /><br />Let me throw third question(i really hope my questions aren&#039;t hindrance, but i feel like a kid in a candy shop :P with you pros) Do you think or have you experienced actual health benefits - physical or mental - after using some drug? Better performance in cognitive or physical functions/fitness or better well being? How about these harder drugs that i addressed before - are they just pure high or do they have some potential?<br /><br />And i still love to get suggestions for &quot;perfect&quot; drug for enjoyment. Im pretty sure that after i regain my health im going to cheer my involvement with SR by having good time with some drug, before i carry on, and im sure this suggestions are quite good for other inexperienced as well 8).<br /><br />I hope i can explore your post later Refyned.<br /><br />Love + *hugs* +&nbsp; :-* to all.

				Hi everyone!&nbsp; I just got done reading all the posts since I made my ridiculously long and rambling one...&nbsp; and it was quite interesting reading!&nbsp; There were several posts that I wanted to make mention of...&nbsp; just hope I remember which ones they were now..&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Well, starting from the top down... (kinda sorta) - @Defy, first on your reply a page or so ago, I was really glad to hear that you have not only the support of your family here at SR, but that you have a r/l best friend/roommate who seems to genuinely have your best interests at heart and it sounds as if having her has helped you imensley.&nbsp; I&#039;m still so proud of you!&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I see that you are now off of coke but have become a vendor of it.&nbsp; I want to say that of course, I wish you the best of luck in your vending endever....&nbsp; but to be honest, and not wanting to be sounding like a bummer or that I don&#039;t have faith in you.. because I do :)&nbsp; I just hope that with as well as you have been doing and with the resolve you have... you seem truly committed to quitting indulging in something that has had negative effects on your life - which is a real plus... still you have been clean for a relatively short period of time as far as being able to have the very substance around you that you will be selling that I just hope that your strength and reslove is and will remain stronger than the temptations you will (or are) being surrounded with.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t take that wrong, as I&#039;m sure you would not take on this project if you didn&#039;t feel ready.&nbsp; I&#039;m only speaking from my knowledge of my own memories and experiences and I know that while I may have been able to embark on something like you are in theory, I highly doubt that I&#039;d be able to resist for long.... then again, I am very aware that everyone is as different from each other as each person is affected by this drug or that or anything else...&nbsp; In any case... I wish you nothing but the best of everything..&nbsp; you certainly seem as if you deserve it! ;D<br /><br />@Refyned - I just loved your post!&nbsp; It was so refreshingly honest and it just reinforced my own thoughts I&#039;ve had since long before having discovered SR (as I&#039;m sure most of the community here has had similar thoughts and still do).. which is that due to the ridiculous drug war, there is just SOOO much &quot;evil drugs&quot; propaganda everywhere.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not on the mainstream news, it&#039;s often written right into the story lines of soap operas and other primetime TV shows, so many people who have not actually spent time with others who do indulge in mood altering substances (whether or not they actually indulge themselves), they have a preconceived notion that &quot;drugs are bad&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have an exact number (or even close), but I&#039;d assume that every day, hundreds of drug deals are made that go quite smoothly.&nbsp; Those don&#039;t ever make the news.&nbsp; Only the ones that &quot;go bad&quot; make the news, and they are very much in the minority.&nbsp; Also, what the TV and other sources of &quot;information&quot; fail to mention is the fact that much of the stuff regarding lasting and serious medical problems more often than not don&#039;t come from the actual drug (as it would have been produced if it were legal in a sterile pharmaceudical environment using FDA approved pure ingredients), but from people having to resort to making do with what is available and most of what is available comes from hardware stores, etc.. and is full of impurities... which are more often than not the true cause of the shocking images of people on their deathbeds that the media eagerly puts on...&nbsp; and on top of all that, people - such as yourself who grew up in a strict religious environment are surely taught from an early age from their own parents and the elders of their church(s) - people who children trust naturally from a very young age - the evils of drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I think that it was a very brave thing that you did by coming here with an open mind and seeing for yourself a better and more complete picture of the majority of people involved in the drug culture.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure that you have also seen the ones who come through here - especially in the spare coin thread(s) who are constantly asking for unreasonable amounts, not paying back and never loaning out.&nbsp; They are fortunately in the minority and also unfortunately, are the mainstream poster people for everyone lumped together in the catetgory &quot;drug addicts&quot;.&nbsp; But I was so glad to see that by your own acknowledgement that while you were surprised at first at the love and sense of genuine caring amongst the majority of members here... the drug addicts that are so supportive of someone wishing to get off of a drug that they feel is detrimental to their life, etc...&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if at this point with the drug war being so politicicised that there is any way to stop it.... but there just might be a chance to at least put a damper on it if more of the people who had believed as you had, would take the step to look at the other side.. the one they won&#039;t hear about in the mainstream.&nbsp; Doubt that will happen anytime soon, but I applaud you for having taken the step.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D ;) ;-*<br />&nbsp;<br />@findingcure - I can&#039;t speak for anyone else, but personally, I would never encourage anyone to try any drug/substance...&nbsp; imo, that is a totally personal decision.&nbsp; At the same time, I also would never judge anyone for using one that I don&#039;t happen to like.&nbsp; But with that said, I also find it very responsible of you to be asking questions and finding out as much as you can before making a decision to try anything new, or deciding even IF you will choose to do so.&nbsp; And you couldn&#039;t have found a better place to ask to get all perspectives as well as other people&#039;s personal experiences.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen so many replies here from people who have given you what I can tell is their honest opinion.. and notice that they tend to vary somewhat from person to person.&nbsp; Which is why you need to understand that people are as different from each other as are each person&#039;s individual experience and reaction to any said substance.&nbsp; What little bit of advice I&#039;d offer you is for the most part what many people seem to experience as well as myself.&nbsp; Well, except for this one:&nbsp; I&#039;m aware that I&#039;m quite in the minority when it comes to weed.&nbsp; Personally, I don&#039;t like the way it affects me so I don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; That is not to say that most everyone else I&#039;ve ever known or known of does in fact thoroughly enjoy it&#039;s effects.&nbsp; And from what I understand, it&#039;s probably the least harmful substance of them all to the body and as far as I know, it doesn&#039;t have addictive properties except for possible emotional or phychological dependance.&nbsp; I have never heard of anyone having physical withdrawl symptoms (not that no one ever has... I&#039;ve just not heard of it)..&nbsp; So, with that said, if I were to recommend any particular drug for you to try, I&#039;d say that weed would probably be the safest and least harmful... from what I&#039;ve heard, it&#039;s often theraputical - which is why more and more states have approved it for medical use.&nbsp; As well as it&#039;s highly unlikely if not impossible to get any sort of addiction or dependence of any kind after trying it once.<br /><br />As far as a couple of other things mentioned - and I&#039;m sure there are those who would disagree with me, but overall, I think from my own experience as well as that of others I&#039;ve known IRL these couple of points are fairly common amongst people in general.&nbsp; <br />1) LSD - it can (and often is) great fun and a truly amazing experience if done around people who you already know, trust and feel comfortable with AND are tripping along with you at the same time.&nbsp; Just about anything that would otherwise be mundane can suddenly become just hilarious and you could easily find yourself along with your friends laughing so hard at the most ridiculous things that the only physical discomfort you may find after you come down (albeit minor) may be sore stomach muscles from having laughed so hard for so long.&nbsp; And it&#039;s about impossible to get addicted to because if you do it one day, then try to do the same amount or even double or tripple the amount the next day, it will do absolutely nothing.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really understand why this phenomanom occurs...&nbsp; but it has to me and to everyone I&#039;ve ever known who has done LSD.&nbsp; If you take a few days off though, it will work again.&nbsp; If this is something you are contemplating, my only suggestion would be that you don&#039;t do it for the first time alone, with people you are not completely comfortable around, or people (even if you trust them and feel comfortable around them normally) if they are not also indulging themselves....&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Heroin - If you have ever heard that if you try it once, twice or even 3 times you will become not only physically addicted, but your tolerance will double each time from the last time.. well, you heard right.&nbsp; I&#039;d personally not recommend that as a first time drug to try as the addiction happens fast and once addicted, is extremely difficult to quit the drug....<br /><br />O.K.&nbsp; I read some other interesting comments but what I just wrote of are the ones I remember and not to discount any of the other great posts I read that were posted over the past couple of days... this one has (once again) gotten extremely too long... so I will end on this note...<br /><br />Much love to all...&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; &nbsp;foxen...<br /><br />OMG.. it&#039;s even longer than I realized... yikes! :o&nbsp; ::)<br />

				:) Thanks all for the kind words!<br /><br />I have asked myself several times if I&#039;m hijacking y&#039;all, and if my comments belong in other places ... I love the fellowship, er, um, ladyship? that y&#039;all are expressing ... it warms my heart and elicits my response ...<br /><br />And then I ask, &quot;Is this appropriate?&nbsp; After all, I&#039;m not exactly in any way a woman ...&quot;<br /><br />Ehhh ... for now I&#039;ll blather, but feel free to kick me to a more appropriate venue.<br /><br />Just the one thought ... I wonder sometimes if I should/could speak out.&nbsp; There&#039;s still more than a little of the preacher in me (and I was even trained as one) ...<br /><br />For now, speaking out would be negative for family, but I keep thinking there may well come a day ...<br /><br />Much love!&nbsp; Defy, your new product looks delicious ... I share the concern above for you and you will be in my prayers ... Sell, make us happy, make an absolute outrageous mint ... and don&#039;t use :)<br /><br />But I think that&#039;s definitely the way you&#039;re planning on going!<br /><br />Ooops, sorry, that&#039;s the dad in me peeking out, no matter how suave and cool I try to be, I&#039;m that (dad) to the core.

				Refyned,<br /><br />Last time I checked, I was male. Having said that, I regularly come and post in this thread. <br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because here, I feel warmly welcome, and there is less hostility than in other parts of the forum. The girls haven&#039;t kicked me out yet xD<br /><br />And the only reason I&#039;m up, alert and feeling good right now is thanks to an excellent recommendation from DefyCode :-) <br />

				Awwwwwwwwwwwww guys! I love all of you! Sorry it&#039;s taken me so long to respond!<br /><br />I was/am out of town and was super busy but I&#039;m back now! No one needs to worry about me back sliding into my old habits. My &quot;connect&#039; actually won&#039;t let me have any coke in my own control. All the orders I have to go package at his/her place and he/she watches me put stuff together. He/she is a great childhood friend and knows my struggle. So even though, YEAH I&#039;m tempted like crazy, there is no way I could &quot;sneak&quot; in a line or anything like that. Thank you all for your support and encouragement and love, there is nothing like the SR family. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!<br /><br />@Foxen....what a lovely fucking post! Sorry I&#039;m a bit drunk right now! :))) I love all of my SR ladies sooooo sooo much!!! It&#039;s cray cray!!! :D<br /><br />@realdeals:.....ooooo...really? *kissies* lol :D&nbsp; :D :D<br /><br /><br />@incubus:&nbsp; mwahahaha I knew you&#039;d love it!<br /><br />-xoxoxo

				ahoy lady thread! i genuinely have a lady issue. it&#039;s pretty long but i could use some more opinions. right so there&#039;s me (dyke), one of my best mates (straight man w/aspergers) and my brother. last night we had a couple tabs of acid each, rinse over half a g of mdma between 3 of us.. not candy flip though, acid dropped around 6-7pm then md like 1am or something.. not sure. anyways the mdma part is when it got weird. my brother had gone somewhere to listen to music or something and my mate just says can i ask you a favour? so i&#039;m like ok sure what is it? and he just says i reeeeeeally want to get with a girl at this party next week(that we&#039;re both going to)and he&#039;s just looking at me.. i look away... and there&#039;s like a really long awkward silence and what a massive headfuck. i mean it really really seemed like he was asking me to have sex with him..? he knows i don&#039;t really swing that way, was it the mdma? or just the aspergers meaning he didn&#039;t communicate wtf he was asking? after that long silence he quietly said lets talk about something else.. uhhhh what! fuck me i was still tripping and just had a line of ket on top of mdma which i&#039;d never even had before, don&#039;t headfuck me! he tried like playing it down a few minutes later just saying there&#039;s going to be girls there and maybe i can help him. despite the fact i don&#039;t know any of them and they&#039;re his friends. anyway i&#039;m confused. and kinda scared to go to this party now. i mean he&#039;s really nice guy but a fucking terrible kisser.. you know when it&#039;s all slobbery and there&#039;s a tongue like probing invasively. do all men kiss like that btw? ergh. yeah. i don&#039;t want to go there. should i just go prepared with a water bottle to spray him if he gets too feisty? have any platonic friends asked you for sex while on mdma? weird experiences with aspergers folk? i&#039;m really hoping it&#039;s the millionth aspergers misunderstanding. he did say it was the best night of the year and kept hugging me but no more touchy than that.. thoughts please please please. it&#039;s comedown day i feel fragile. i want a puppy to play with. multivitamins have a nasty aftertaste. i won&#039;t be able to get anything resembling a clear explanation from him either.

				Hi Gals n guys&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Hey Ron, Can I ask if anything happened inbetween that long pause you&#039;s had? How do you know what he kisses like?&nbsp; :P I was thinking &quot;Oh no, he&#039;s pounced on Ron&quot; when I was reading it, lol, felt for you. I&#039;m not sure, I think he&#039;ll be okay at the party but it depends on how you know how he kisses, lol. He might think he has a chance now&nbsp; ::) ;)

				no nothing at all last night, i could just feel the wtf expression stuck on my face hahah. so maybe when i was mid teens i used to drink a lot. he had absinthe. i was sexually confused. shit happens.. we&#039;ve been friends for years since no weirdness. last night was just completely out of nowhere. i jokingly said a bit earlier that i think i&#039;ll be alone for a long time unless i defect to men.. people usually get that i&#039;m joking face to face! well that&#039;s a lie i deadpan a lot but this was obviously a joke.

				Well Ron,<br /><br />Just remain hopeful that if you do ever need to lock lips again, he may have got better since his teens?<br /><br />On an almost unrelated note, a close friend I grew up with had aspergers, but oddly enough always managed to rattle out some of the wittiest and sharpest sarcasm I&#039;d ever heard. It was almost like he&#039;d studied the theory of sarcasm and humour, and memorised the formula.

If you are lesbian, it sounds a bit contradictory on that front I know my lez friends would not be going to that party in being in your shoes.&nbsp; I wish you the best in getting it resolved.<br /><br />-dc

				well i didn&#039;t say yes or imply that i was in any way interested so he shouldn&#039;t be expecting anything at all. but god i&#039;ve been so fucking bad with blurring the lines with friends in the past. i only hangout with straight people now and just say i&#039;m gay (i&#039;m about 80% if you like a better idea) to keep things simple. oh also fuck i&#039;m taking another guy to the party who also wants me to help him meet girls and i can&#039;t bail.. i just can&#039;t. i don&#039;t know why people seem to think i&#039;m a fucking matchmaker or potential pity sexer. i should probably just stop trying to help people. i&#039;m such a fuckup.

				ok i massively understated the extent of his difficulty communicating his point clearly. he was on lsd, mdma and mxe. this doesn&#039;t improve his aspergers for other people at all it just makes him feel empathy. he has a very hard time vocalising his thoughts. i didn&#039;t say his explanation was unclear i&#039;m saying i was in too much of a weird headspace at that point to even ask. nor did i want to. the thought just made me feel fucking horrible. that he could be like oh you&#039;re such a great friend, could i bother you for a fuck? i went and threw up a shit load after it completely murdered my buzz. and trust me a simple no will not work at all with this guy. he can&#039;t follow instructions. i have him in my house yesterday i say please take your shoes off when you come in the door and he just ignores me and does whatever the fuck he wants, trailing mud through the place. just ridiculously inconsiderate. i tell him ash goes in the ashtray, he puts it on the floor and butt on the table, used chewing gum just on the table. i have to tell him the same things over and over again and he still doesn&#039;t get it. ponces all my shit every time so what he wants to use me for free drugs and sex? no i&#039;m fucking pissed off now. i&#039;m going to give this one some time to settle because my brains still pretty scrambled. if i think about this anymore right now im going to lose it. etizolam time. night ladies, thanks for the input.

				Good morning ladies (and the occasional gent),<br /><br />The lovely Miss Mary directed me this way, I hope you don&#039;t mind. I&#039;ve been on SR for around 18 months but am new to being a vendor (it&#039;s all very exciting!). I&#039;m both a medical and recreational cannabis user, with an interest in psychedelics. I&#039;ve tried both LSD and mushrooms and hope to try other psychedelics in the future. Cannabis is my real love and passion, though. I love trying different strains of imported bud, beautifully purged BHO concentrates and most of all, cooking with hash! Having never been a smoker, I&#039;ve got a wealth of experience with cooking cannabis (buds, hash, kief, concentrates, oils, the lot!) and it&#039;s definitely a huge passion of mine.<br /><br />I hope to get to know some of you lovely ladies :)<br /><br />Freedom, Peace and Love,<br /><br />Sugarleaf<br /><br />PS. Mary, after reading some of your posts on this thread, I can really see the Scot shining through!

Lol&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m good, but I&#039;m pretty buzzed and anxious, dying to hear what people think of the chocs! I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d be that excited but I am, I was even up at 6am checking my messages (there weren&#039;t any! Haha!). Hash chocolates are the BEST breakfast, what better way to start the day? :) I&#039;d grab one myself but I need to keep a clear head for a few hours!<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a strangely high tolerance to LSD and mushies, tried &quot;regular&quot; doses the first couple of times of each but soon had to take &quot;heroic&quot; doses just to experience low levels of effects. I think it&#039;s very much down to the medication I&#039;ve been on, but thanks to cannabis my medical issues have improved drastically, so normal doses of psychedelics should be possible for me in the next few months :) You should definitely give mushies another try if you&#039;re an LSD lover! The shorter duration is really nice, they usually leave me feeling invigorated after a trip, whereas LSD can leave me physically exhausted from all the bouncing around, but mentally alert and unable to relax. I had much more intense hallucinations with mushrooms, I spent about 3 hours lying in bed whilst waving my hands in front of the white wall, conducting and composing hallucinations like a sheet of moving music. Then I had a very interesting discussion with a clementine. He was a good guy, for a clementine. I was a little sad when I ate him, but man was he delicious.<br /><br />As for bud vendors, my top two have to be DoctorNoname and lucymcgee. Always had good service and quality from PuffDaddy too, but I don&#039;t think his trim/manicure and cure are up to the same sort of standard as Doc and Lucy. Was also pleased with HighTestMMD and DreamGreen&#039;s Lemon G13 was insane :)<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br />Sugarleaf

				Just quickly passing by again.<br /><br />It seems there has been lot of talk here lately and few topics i missed. But i dont mind - they were very interesting though. I hope Ron Swanson got her stuff together.<br /><br />Any way, nice to meet you Sugarleaf from my part as well. Such a shame you sell only UK to UK your chocolates. Edibles has been one of my interest lately. I came here SR originally for medical reasons and they seem a bit easier to use. And effects are hopefully bit softer or smoother. But since i dont have any experience i cant be sure what kind of effect different edibles really have. There is chocolates, candies, chews...<br /><br />I hope my writing isn&#039;t unclear or rough edged - im very tired and empty brained at the moment ::) *yawn*<br /><br />&nbsp;:-*

				Hi everyone...&nbsp; just want to let you know that I wrote a message meant mainly for all those who I met in these forums, in the [new] Official Spare Coin Thread.. as that is where I met most of those who I have come to love, care a lot about and consider to be my Family.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty long, rambling and for the most part probably boring, so I&#039;m not going to re-post it in the other threads where some or most of you have spead out to, but nonetheless, I wrote it for you and if you care to read it, it is at:&nbsp; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=209603.msg1593944#msg1593944<br /><br />If you&#039;ve already read it or have better things to spend your time on (quite understandable), then just please disregard this post here.....<br /><br />(except this part):&nbsp; &nbsp;Love you all!&nbsp; <br /><br />~foxen

				Does anybody reckon this will amount to anything awesome?<br /><br />http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php<br /><br />I am going to post this elsewhere - I&#039;m explaining so you don&#039;t think I&#039;m spamming it, I&#039;m not. I genuinely want to know, and want to put the feelers out in the various threads I was a regular part of because I trust the opinions of those threads more than others. :-)
