				USPS has completely screwed up with me a few times which has caused me to get about 2 refunds out of 33 orders. What sucks is a new vendor I placed an order with says I have a high refund rate and now its starting to bother me. I don&#039;t want any vendors to be deterred from doing business with me because of USPS screw ups&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Would most vendors consider this a &quot;high refund rate&quot; and is there anything I can do to get it down?&nbsp; what sucks the most is this is no fault of my own and i have to deal with it now

				&quot;high refund rate&quot; is subjective.. 5.05% doesn&#039;t seem high to me, but can&#039;t blame the vendor fr refusing your business, that&#039;s his right..

I would think if you had 2 screwups in one lifetime that it might be unsafe for someone to send you SR orders.
