				Greetings SR-<br />I come to you as a well established member, however I created this account to ultimately protect my anonymity due to the fact that my day to day user name has details in my prior posts about my general location, purchases and whatnot.&nbsp; I assure you that I am not trolling, nor am I trying to waste anybody&#039;s time.&nbsp; I know there are very experienced people here and I could use some honest feedback regarding my &#039;situation&#039;, if you will.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am currently about to begin my second year as a sophomore at an undergraduate university.&nbsp; The university is located in the same city as my hometown, I&#039;ve lived here my entire life.&nbsp; Last march, I came across SR and once I figured everything out, started making purchases-mostly for bulk MDMA sourced from a reliable vendor out of the country.&nbsp; So far, everything has been kosher.&nbsp; I have a great local clientele base, and have been making a very nice sum of cash that I&#039;ve been saving.&nbsp; So far I have over $6,000 saved up and still have another 40 grams to sell :)&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t be happier with my life, this summer has been the BEST EVER and I have to credit SR for most of this. Thank you DPR and the staff here at SR for making all of this possible-you guys are the shit!<br /><br />With that general information out of the way, here comes my dilemma.&nbsp; Last year, I received financial aid to complete my freshman year at this university.&nbsp; However, I will be unable to take a full load of classes this semester, and am wanting to pay for 6 credit hours out of pocket for just two classes.&nbsp; The reasons for this have to do with situations in my personal life, but I will not be able to receive federal funding this year for college.&nbsp; Currently, I do not work a legitimate-taxable job.&nbsp; Further, I can&#039;t receive a job as I am currently in the appeals process for social security disability and me taking a job would defeat the purpose of said disability.&nbsp; I have a very strong case, and my attorney is willing to fight this all the way to federal court if need be.&nbsp; I do not want to risk what could be stable income for the rest of my life over a petty restaurant gig to justify why I have all this cash.<br /><br />tl;dr<br /><br />Basically, My question is this:&nbsp; If I were to pay over $2,000 for these classes that I am taking, would it raise any red flags with the government as to how this single male with no income in his early 20&#039;s is able to pay a couple grand out of pocket for tuition?&nbsp; Naturally, before every order arrives, I&#039;m very nervous as if the package is going to be intercepted and a controlled delivery will take place at my residence-but that seems like a very unlikely occurrence.&nbsp; I feel with the security measures SR has in place, as well as my own to protect myself on my end and the fact that very few people know how I receive my gear that my finances would be the only plausible way that LE would be able to tell that I&#039;ve been up to &#039;something&#039;.<br /><br />Would me paying cash for my tuition at a state owned university raise any red flags?&nbsp; SR is a means to an end for me, and I have seven more years of studying before I can graduate as a criminal defense attorney which as you all probably know is a VERY expensive endeavor.<br /><br /><br />I wish I felt comfortable posting this from my usual SR name, but I hope you understand that I&#039;m not only a little paranoid, but that I do not want my buyer account mixed up with personal issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for understanding, and for your input. <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I am kinda in the same situation as you! but I would think it wouldnt&nbsp; raise any flags if you paid with a check under ur name or a family members,&nbsp; bc my parents paid my tuition upfront under my name but nothing was ever said, and I worked 2 days a week on mim wage.&nbsp; Its my impression that red flags are thrown up only when people are spending large sums of money like over 10,000 and have no where legit to say it came from. I quit my old job to start a new better but they werent ready for me for another 4 months, so I lived off&nbsp; my parents during that time. they paid my rent and all my bills and no FED&#039;s came and asked me questions! Hope it all works out man!

Just running some ideas as I doubt the university cares who pays as long as they get money.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very good input, thank you so much, brother!&nbsp; Yeah, my family knows I don&#039;t work and would also interrogate me to the core if I asked them to do any sort of payment under their names.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think making small payments, like you said, will be the best option.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep each one under a $500 as I know I&#039;ll have monthly payments the school will expect from me.&nbsp; <br /><br />If anybody else has anything else constructive to add to this, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it!<br /><br />+1 to you StE on my main account :D

				Good luck with it all, man. <br /><br />Maybe fake a hobby? Or actually develop a hobby that you can say brings in some money. <br /><br />My advice about dealing on SR in college (take it or leave it) is not to tell any of your peers. Don&#039;t get drunk and brag!<br /><br />Peace :)

				I would suggest that you mowed a lot of lawns over the summer. No paper trails, and an awful lot of 20s. <br />2000 is not enough money to raise suspicion, you could say you saved it up from birthday cards. 10,000 is the amount of money you need to deposit at a bank to have them file papers (just to confirm)

				If you are gunna do it, do it, but make sure you do it right. It&#039;s not just a fuck around. You gotta make sure you can wash the money properly, have a steady supply ensure you can give SR the commitment you need whilst also maintaining your studies. If you can do that, do it. If you can&#039;t, don&#039;t. There is no need for some psycho-analyst approach to this because it&#039;s a simple matter of balance.

				I honestly don&#039;t think it&#039;ll raise any red flags, especially only being $2,000. <br /><br />sdesu
