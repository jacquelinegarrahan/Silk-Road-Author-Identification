So I&#039;m giving myself a nice two-three months reboot. It&#039;s been only two weeks completely drug free. First time I&#039;m experiencing time distortion while being sober&nbsp; (time is slowwww)&nbsp; :)

				My polly drug use is taking its toll on me.. My eyes feel like they are worn out from dilating and constricting to different extremes the last 24 hours. Does anyone else thing about the potential damage drugs can do to they eye ball and its functions? Or am I just being paranoid. I have had MDMA, speed, alcohol (to much alcohol) and opiates. By the whole eye thing I mean taking MDMA making your pupils huge then I took some opiates&nbsp; which made my pupils tiny, do you think there is any risk involved? <br />Jesus, sorry for talking so much my friends. I need some sleep :P
