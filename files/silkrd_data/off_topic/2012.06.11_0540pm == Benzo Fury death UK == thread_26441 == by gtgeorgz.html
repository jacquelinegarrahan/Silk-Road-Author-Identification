				Legal highs are in the press again after 2 people at the Rockness Festival have ended up in hospital and another one dead after taking what was thought to be Benzo Fury (6-APB), so a ban on this chemical is probably coming very soon.<br /><br />http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-festivals/9322841/Death-of-19-year-old-at-Rockness-festival-linked-to-legal-high-Benzo-Fury.html<br /><br />my thoughts are they all took way to much as there isn&#039;t any education about it, or was mixing it with other drugs, like alcohol.&nbsp; <br />It makes me sad and angry to see people die and end up in hospital after taking drugs, especially RC&#039;s because of lack of education our society provides on such substances.

				Thanks Gtgeorgz,<br /><br />Yes I saw this too - although as you say the story seems a bit think on the ground. We don&#039;t know if he was taking these so-called legal highs with poor quality controlled drugs or how much alcohol was influencing the situation - far more people die from choking on their own vomit due to drinking than due to overdoses of legal highs after all!<br /><br />V.

				and thats a very good point! e.g. far more people die from horse riding than an MDMA overdose each year but still MDMA remains controversial and illegal like many other drugs, and horse riding encouraged. Society just doesn&#039;t make sense to me, what people need is education about these substances, not being banned from using them. I guess thats the point i&#039;m trying to make to any PR/officials that may be reading this... haha

				And &#039;6-APB&#039; finally begins to circle the drain after MXE, Mephedrone and others, through baseless journalism, lack of any formal toxicology report (which will take at least a month to obtain) and useless sensationalism, not to mention a lack of any proper&#039; harm reduction&#039; advice like buying a set of scales - it is a real pity that David Nutt&#039;s new organisation has gained little traction so far because the quality of advice is superb.<br /><br />The SR is an absolute blessing as I do not have to resort to this gunk out of desperation like I used to, which often has very low LD50&#039;s/therapeutic ratios dangerously close to unity - stories such as these make me so grateful for not having to resort to random chemicals from which I can only rely on limited trip reports posted on DF/Bluelight.

Had all this shit-storm when Meph was in the papers. The reality is that unfortunately when you take drugs, sometimes bad things happen and this is especially the case if you just use Google to buy ya drugs because half of those sites are bent anyway. Also the way that these journalists report this shit is so rinse-and-repeat it&#039;s boring and if we are honest, so is the reactionary shit it causes. Some kid dies - media scream about it - something gets banned - something new comes along. <br /><br />Same, same, same, same, same, sameeeeee againnnnnn pleeeeeease! Nothing new ever happens and if we are honest, the British public stopped giving a fuck about this shit after Meph-Gate died out anyway because that was the only decent thing that came out. 6-APB or Benzo Fury or whatever nonsense it&#039;s meant to be called is crap, so is 5-APB. Just crap versions of MDA IMO and that&#039;s why they never caught on. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s not awful that someone died, of course it is and it&#039;s always awful when someone dies and my heart genuinely goes out to their family. What I am saying is that the reactions it gets from the people that tell us what is and isn&#039;t interesting and what we should and shouldn&#039;t think is very old now. I don&#039;t need telling what to think about someones personal habits, I&#039;d actually much rather be told what&#039;s going on in Syria, a detailed report on the Spanish Banking crisis or what is going on in Libya (which every fucker seems to have forgotten after feeling very satisfied with themselves despite the fact that Libya is now going to shit and could be on the way to a civil war) but oh well....that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />If you are going to report on this shit I want to also have a full report on every alcohol, smoking, crack, Bing, Heroin, medication, over the counter aspirin death as well. What is the difference? The difference is it&#039;s got a jazzy name that people who tell us what is interesting haven&#039;t said that much. Nothing else.

				its like an endless cycle of RC chem comes out, someone is killed due to it, RC chem gets banned, new RC chem comes to replace it.. It quite sad it has to be like this to be honest. I just want to take a massive shit on David Cameron&#039;s desk and slap him silly and give him a lesson on how to educate the public properly about drugs. And yes that is true Lim, i wonder what chemical is going to come and replace when its banned though...&nbsp; (this is also my 100th post, yay)

				Absolutely, the ISCD&#039;s advice is required reading for anyone who&#039;s never thought to google for trip reports or has never read Erowid. David Nutt is a real hero of mine, and I can only hope that we make some progress on basing drug policy on rational harms before the end of his life for him to experience.<br /><br />Just compare this http://www.drugscience.org.uk/methoxetamineadvice.html to this http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/methoxetamine<br /><br />Note: The talktofrank article isn&#039;t quite as bad as I thought, and is indeed lightyears ahead of what is available from US government funded organisations such as DARE etc.

				It&#039;s an ass-backwards system really. Substances that have no history of harming anyone but, if even, the user are outlawed and demonized for no reason. People buy RC&#039;s that we know little to nothing about as an alternative, and end up killing other people. <br /><br />So what do these fucktards do? Ban the RC and wait for a new one to come along. <br /><br />Because legalizing the substances that are actually safe, so people have no reason to go snorting bath salts in the first place makes no sense at all, right?

				mhmm, talk to frank is the biggest pile of wank ever made. They should, at least put dosage recommendations up on the site for the people who are going to take the drug whether its banned or not. At least this would help in cutting down in the bad experiences/deaths. I&#039;m so glad i properly research every drug before i take it, on here, erowid and ISCD. If i didnt do this research i probably would&#039;ve killed myself by now, and the same goes for my friends who take drugs aha.<br /><br />To be fair, i reckon if drugs where all legal and freely avalible, a lot less people would use them, as them being legal takes the thrill and &#039;danger&#039; away from using them.

Of course we need a government to some degree or another, we just don&#039;t need telling if we can or can&#039;t get wrecked or not.
