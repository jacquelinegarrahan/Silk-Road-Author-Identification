				Ok, my weed is almost ready to harvest and be put up on SR after drying and curing. Blue Cheese and Sour Diesel. <br />I&#039;ve had pretty bad results when drying and curing in the past...lemon skunk, master kush, bug bang, they just don&#039;t have much if any smell at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Previously dried for 7 days at 27 Degress Celsius and 55% Relative Humidity then into glass jars opening every day and turning. Flushed for 2 weeks.<br /><br />Can someone post a foolproof method of drying and curing....one that you have used successfully. If i use the method successfully, i will PM your username and send you 2g free of charge :)<br /><br />I want the gear to smell amazing and through the bag like what you would normally find on SR.<br /><br />Thanks muchly!

Yeah dried in the growing room, i&#039;m right in thinking that 55% RH was ok to dry at?

				55 is a little on the low side, and the longer you can extend the drying time, the better (within reason, of course).&nbsp; I aim for around 60-65, or I should say I hope for 60-65, since I don&#039;t really do anything much to control it.&nbsp; Your rh will probably rise as the temperature drops anyway. I find that any dark cupboard in my house is usually around the 18 degree/65 rh mark, although your mileage may vary, depending on where you live.&nbsp; Still, 55 isn&#039;t too bad, as long as you jar the buds whilst there is still some moisture in them.<br /><br />One other possibility for lack of smell is harvesting too early.&nbsp; What method are you using to judge harvest time?&nbsp; Scope, guesswork or breeder time?&nbsp; It&#039;s probably the heat that has caused your issues, but proper harvest timing can definitely affect how strong the weed smells.
