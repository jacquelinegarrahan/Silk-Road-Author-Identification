				BMR is actually an extremely well-designed site. It&#039;s similar to SR, although it never received the same amount of publicity. The owner isn&#039;t as much of a notable personality as DPR, but I&#039;ll be damned if he doesn&#039;t listen to what his users want and shortly deliver the features. The updates the site receives are usually pretty nice and lack bugs, etc.<br /><br />There&#039;s obviously going to be a bias here (due to the fact that we&#039;re on the SR forums, for a start), but don&#039;t slander the other website. If you don&#039;t want to use it, don&#039;t. But at least have respect for competition. Be mature; we&#039;re all gentlemen here.<br /><br />The forums likely went down because the mod accidentally banned someone. When you ban someone on an .onion website, it bans everyone. Everyone that uses Hidden Services show up as localhost, or 127.0.0.1 (the IP designated). This is because we&#039;re routed internally through the Tor network.<br /><br />BMR:<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;ve used BMR for a long time now, and it&#039;s actually where I started off as a digital goods vendor due to SR&#039;s high seller&#039;s fee. While there are quite a lot of scammers, there&#039;s also a lot of legitimate buyers and sellers. It all comes down to checking feedback and using common sense.

You&#039;re just as important as us guys are to this site and the evolution of it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />The problem is, one of the moderators must have accidentally IP banned someone. There are options to ban single accounts and not ban the IP. It must have been a simple mistake. Some forum softwares are a bit confusing with this kind of thing. I think this happened once before with the BMR forums and they were back online fairly quick.<br /><br />I mean no disrespect, by the way. I think SR is an incredibly well-respected and excellent marketplace; the traffic speaks for itself. But I think BMR deserves some respect and consideration too.

They may be still having issues in this regard with random shit everywhere. (Like SR forums today with the images everywhere.) They fixed the problem ↑; IDK this is occurring..... your time sig. is not much older than mine, so no F1 there. Try again later, and if still buggy report it to LeContag, Turd_Russel or admin. Also, check LeContag&#039;s key sig. on replies as his was one of the mod acc./s that were hacked.<br /><br />Keep us ↑dated. If you can&#039;t log in later and report, I&#039;ll report it for you.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.
