				So waiting at the 12 hour mark to when mail usually arrives expecting product. How to pass the time, cant sleep insomnia partial to wd partial to excitement partial to when i do fall asleep wake up Very shortly after from sweating or chronic pain.<br /><br />Trying to keep myself from lookin at the time. Seems sooo much slower when you keep checkin! Tryin to find comical shows or something interesting. Of course NOTHIN takes my attention away from the countdown! Going crazy in anticipation. Then what if product doesnt arrive and back to 24 hours!!!<br /><br />How do you pass the time from the countdown to getting your product!

				Jesus, take a chill pill. <br /><br />Yes we are all excited to get our drugs, im currently wait 2+ weeks on a few packages. However I have enough of a life that it doesn&#039;t occupy all of my thoughts. Get a job or make some friends. I&#039;ve never lost sleep over checking the mail

				Hah.didn&#039;t kno I sounded that bad. Well im currently on the disabled side of things, so not many possibilities with the job I had to stop or goin out with friends. But the point was at the 12 hour mark seems to get me amped and over occupy my thoughts.<br /><br />The rest of the days waiting don&#039;t bother me, I do whatever I do for thatday. It isn&#039;t until itcomes close that I start to think about feeling better, not so much high rather than normal.

				Dude the worst thing is to get your hopes up. If your package for some reason doesn&#039;t show up your going to lose your mind and flipshit.Also you want to be very cautious when accepting a package, NEVER anxious otherwise you may overlook some key signs of a controlled delivery and fuck yourself over due to over-excitement. Whenever I get a package I just grab it like I&#039;m surprised, give it a shake and set it down by the door for an hour.<br />If LE kicks in the door, the package is unopened and then THEY have to prove that you knew what was inside the parcel/envelope.

				Haha no i dont smoke meth or mess with any kind of stimulants though it would certainly appear as if i did!! Hah. Yea i started playin a video game again called Dragon Age 2 since it requires a lot of leveling and running around to complete quests. But i got bored of it unfortunately. Maybe ill start playing Diablo 3 again! Thats another time consuming game in which i can actually play with other people instead of just the computer and try to get rare pick ups to make my character much stronger. Though i rented the game Resident Evil 6 because a friend and I would play co-op and nercenary mode and got almost every character on every level a score of SS whichbis the highest possible score. And trust me. Its NOT easy to do! But i was very disapointed in RE6 as the gameplay was very different which made it easier yet harder at the same time and ammo is extremely scarce in this one as opposed to RE4 and RE5 but RE6 was not only different. It was different in a bad way it was no where near as fun as the previous games. Which was very disappointing as i was really lookin forward to its release. But i think it was a diff game company that made this one so that explains that. I wish game industries just stucj to what they know whsn they have a good thing goin instead of trying new things!
