				maybe it was on the old forum, but there once was a thread about the voices that people use when they read posts from different members. <br /><br />The only reason I bring this up is that the other day, while surfing the forum while tripping on 4-aco-det, there were a lot of voices in my head reading the posts, but none of them really tied to the poster, rather the content of their posts. There is ONE that stood out, though, and I still can&#039;t shake it when reading. For some reason I can&#039;t explain, kewmfkm sounds like Morgan Freeman in my head and I can&#039;t fucking stop it. It is starting to drive me a bit crazy.<br /><br />anyone else have this kind of thing happen? and if so, post about it here, please. It would make me feel better if I was not the only one going through this.

				limitless bounces between the guy who played the doctor on a few seasons (I don&#039;t know his name) and Hugh Laurie for the most part, but when you go on your striping spree&#039;s , there is a hint of Idris Elba (not sure if I spelled that right)

				For some reason the dude with the limp neck in his display pic makes me think of eminem.<br /><br />That, combined with his interest in gangsterism made me originally assign eminem as limetless&#039; voice.<br /><br />Then when I realized his nationality I tacked on an england accent.<br /><br />So limetless sounds like a british eminem to me.

				Oh and my Pro-pic is from this film - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tThP-EhcH4A<br /><br />Without a doubt one of the best British Gangster films ever made and IMO one of the best British Films in the last 25 years. Was made in 1999. And I&#039;ve been to the place where the opening scene is filmed. :)<br /><br />It&#039;s also fairly realistic as well and isn&#039;t semi-comedic like Guy Richie Gangster films. The bit where the guy gets a taxi dropped on him is pretty inspiring tbh.
