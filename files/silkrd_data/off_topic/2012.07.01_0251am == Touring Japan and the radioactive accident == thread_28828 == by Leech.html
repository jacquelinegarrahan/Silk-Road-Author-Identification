				Has anyone toured the Land of the Rising Sun before? It&#039;s a beautiful place actually and without LE!&nbsp; :P Well that&#039;s kidding, there are LE around of course every country has them, but LE there don&#039;t EVER fucking random nab civilians off the streets like some places do, which they act worst than criminals. Also unlike China there&#039;s no boycotting shit and you can surf any website you want.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />What saddens me is the leakage of nuclear waste. Does anybody know it&#039;s safe to stay there. One would even have phobia of drinking local water for the fear it would affect the generations of the offspring, let alone eating local poultry. Does radiation has mild effect even 30 miles radius?<br /><br />But Japan was such a BEAUTY!&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Japan is currently one serious earthquake short of a true disaster that will effect the rest of the world. The government lies repeatedly to its citizens about the sheer toxicity of the nuclear waste. Beautiful country, yes, but it isn&#039;t worth it to go there anymore. No the water and food are not safe.

				^Seriously. Let&#039;s hope another earthquake does not happen. I heard that reactor building #4 is in danger of collapsing on its own. <br /><br />People don&#039;t realize that some of these buildings have extremely radioactive, liquified nuclear waste just sitting there, practically exposed to open air. If something were to atomize or disperse this shit into the atmosphere, the western US would be fucked. Even the east coast would receive fallout which would spoil crops and generally screw everything and everyone.

				Seriously now its still a tourist attraction. Just wondering if there is a radius of affected area. But I guess that wouldn&#039;t count as the trains can cover many parts of Japan. Because of the popularity of natural hot spring I also wonder who dare to soak oneself in it again?

				Shit, a little radioactivity isn&#039;t going to scare me away. I still plan on visiting again next year as it&#039;s a beautiful country so long as you get out of the cities. I can&#039;t stand the Japanese themselves which is a shame because I&#039;d love to live there.&nbsp; :-\ Either way, I don&#039;t plan on having children in my lifetime nor do I plan on living past 50 so fuck do I care if it&#039;s highly radioactive. ;D
