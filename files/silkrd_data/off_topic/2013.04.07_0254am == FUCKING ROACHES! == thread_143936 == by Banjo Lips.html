I called the management, the health dept and 911. they just laugh at me and tell me to stop smoking crack! can anyone watching this bug report help a homeboy out?

				Go to a pet store and buy some gegcos and let them loose in your room.<br /><br />I am not kidding. A friend of mine did this and it worked amazingly well. <br /><br />Also go through every inch of your room with a can of expanding foam and fill in any holes you find. <br /><br />Only other choice is some nasty chemicals or icky traps. <br /><br />But I feel for you. Sorry to hear you have to live in such a place. I for one would rather pitch a tent in the woods than live with those things.

				Halfway house?&nbsp; Why not a full house?&nbsp; &nbsp;Not playing with a full deck of cards?&nbsp; &nbsp;52 pickup?&nbsp; <br /><br />Just a few questions:<br /><br />Enlighten us as to why you were in prison?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We&#039;re you the mommy or the daddy of the cel?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Did your bum get used to it eventually?<br />Did you get really good at Giving head ?<br /><br />I bet prison life was just like summer camp. Together with the boys, sleeping on cots in bunkbeds . . . So fun.<br /><br />I&#039;d be the cel bitch myself.&nbsp; They would rape me until I bleed badly.&nbsp; I&#039;d be forced to be giving head like I loved it.&nbsp; That&#039;s what shanks are shiva are for .&nbsp; <br /><br />

				FUCKING ROACHES.<br /><br />I had to check this thread just in case this wasn&#039;t a metaphor. My anger and loathing required me to check it.<br /><br />The only thing worse than roaches are BEDBUGS. FUCK BEDBUGS. But roaches are #2 on my hit list. I&#039;ve killed a thousand of the suckers, ugh. <br /><br />The gecko suggestion is gold. They will eat the ever living shit out of those roaches.
