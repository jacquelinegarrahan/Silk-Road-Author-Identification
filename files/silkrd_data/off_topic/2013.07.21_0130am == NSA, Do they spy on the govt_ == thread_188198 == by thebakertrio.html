				Thinking it all over with the phone and web surveillance do you think the NSA is also spying on members of congress or other parts of the govt at large? <br /><br />I wonder if bama&#039;s daughters phones are tapped or are they immune?

If there&#039;s one thing LE loves, its bringing down a crooked politician. <br /><br />There was some congressman like 5 years ago that got caught with a bunch of cash in his freezer. (anyone remember his name?) And there was an informant that wore a wire and recorded conversations. That was more FBI than NSA, but I&#039;d be willing to bet the NSA snoops on politicains.

Think about it. Some nosey employee working there could just get bored and decide they want to see what&#039;s been hapening in the life of Paris Hilton and have a look through the confidential info for Paris Hilton. They could do it to politicians... Anyone. IMO it is a massive security risk&nbsp; that people can have such easy access to anybody&#039;s personal data and communications. If this is just surfacing, think of how many things are still hidden from us.

				A true democratic Government would have no secrets.<br />All Government policies, deals and all expenditures should be transparent for everyone to see.<br /><br />But that would never happen. All the corrupt politicians, secret deals and secret policies and spying would be revealed and the Government would crumble.
