				The order said 5 doses of DMT, but I received two pills... I&#039;m confused. Am I just supposed to empty the capsules and snort/smoke it? Thanks for the help.

				Perhaps he divided the doses into the two capsules as an alternative to a small baggy? It&#039;s a bit different though, I agree. ??? Either way if you&#039;re sure that it&#039;s even DMT then smoke it for sure! :))

				Are you familiar with the smell/appearance of DMT?&nbsp; Open em up and see if it&#039;s your DMT in the capsules.&nbsp; Seems odd that he would ship 5 doses in two capsules, however...

				No, I ordered DMT from buddha as well and it didn&#039;t come in pills. However, I did notice he sells 2 &quot;shroom&quot; pills for about the same price as DMT so I&#039;d bet that&#039;s what they are.

				I think that I may have figured it out... I ordered ayahuasca pills but cancelled, and they must&#039;ve been shipped anyway. I PM&#039;d Buddha and he said that they definitely weren&#039;t from him. I guess that I have two free ayahuasca pills :\

				&nbsp;:o<br />Did you have any other orders you were waiting for?<br /><br />Be careful, hopefully you know what&#039;s in there.

				I&#039;ve ordered pharmahuasca, shrooms, and regular dmt in that order. I ordered the pharmahuasca before the shrooms or dmt (which I ordered simultaneously). I have the shrooms for sure, and I believe that I have pharmahuasca even though I cancelled. The seller still must&#039;ve shipped for some reason.
