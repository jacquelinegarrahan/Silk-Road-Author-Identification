				Around christmas last year I started taking a lot of lsd, around 1mg once a week for about 6 months. This is white fluff, good quality L.<br />I&#039;ve noticed this past month since I&#039;ve stopped there is always these really bright almost hyper colors that dance around in the peripheral of my vision.<br />It&#039;s only really noticeable when I&#039;m in a dark room. When I&#039;m in the day light I can ignore it and it&#039;s not a big deal.<br />I used to do a lot of acid as a teenager but I&#039;m in my 30&#039;s now so maybe I just fried myself for a little bit, idk but it&#039;s just getting a little annoying seeing things that&#039;s not there while sober.<br /><br />Anyone else ever have this happen to them?

				it&#039;s called hppd (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder). tends to go away on its own after a long break from psychs. personally, it would not bother me at all unless it interfered with my visual field.

				Above advice is good but bear in mind that any issues with vision may be a genuine medical issue.<br /><br />Worth going to see your doc if this persists.<br /><br />Thing with LSD is that you ought to be cautious with use. Seen people who took too much over a long period and things can get troublesome.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry, your still fine, but give it a rest for a year.<br /><br />I took a fair bit of LSD in the day and more mushrooms as they were/are free in the Autumn and this years rain means a shitload of shrooms will be sold from UK vendors!<br /><br />I myself will be out with a few bin bags hoping for a nice crop!<br /><br />Shrooms, if you really want to use something in a few months, they would be better than LSD IMO.<br /><br />For now, leave the hallucinogenics alone.<br /><br />1mg doses? Try not to get a tolerance for LSD!<br /><br />Once a year is my tactic. OK. Maybe two or three this year!<br /><br />Good luck friend.

				Yeah, I know the 1mg doses were kind of over doing it but I just don&#039;t get that quality L here too often and it was perfect for high doses.<br />I remember this happening when I was younger but it&#039;s just way more intense now. Even if it never goes away it&#039;s completely manageable so w/e.<br /><br />

				ive experienced kinda similar like when i focus at the carpet the shit moves a little. and i really get wierd little flighty streaking visuals when lookin at a bright sky, this usually happens after a good high dose trip but usually stops after a week of so. dosent really bother me i just chucked it up to my brain recovering and like maybe my eyes n brain were just tired bucause i always stay up a long time when tripping and cant seem to shut down.
