				If you are going through tor, the exit node may be banned. try hitting &quot;new identity&quot; to change your tor path. It might take a few times, and it might not work at all.

When SR was having unannounced maintenance I posted asking if anyone else was having issues with SR.<br /><br />I got banned for &quot;talking about sources&quot; even though i was pretty vague and used abbreviations, and for the past 3 months I&#039;ve seen people blantanly discuss Silk Road without abbreviations and nothing happen.<br /><br />Sum ole&#039; bullshiiit<br />

				The site is 100% clearnet and they make a point to keep all activity on their boards legal. You can&#039;t even reference a source, even cryptically. You can say &quot;deep web&quot; and that&#039;s about it. Like a lot of *chan sites they don&#039;t let you use Tor while accessing the site. People use Tor to post kiddy diddling on those kinds of sites so they can&#039;t get caught, so the admins pretty much blacklist every Tor address they can detect.

				I remember back in highschool, they never blocked 420chan, but they blocked 4chan for cp, then one day it switched (4chan was now unblocked, and 420chan was now blocked for cp)<br /><br />Gotta love dumbass sys-admins&nbsp; ::)

				Fair dos to you kryptoz.&nbsp; To be honest mate if im not working i can get REALLY bored.&nbsp; I try and do things but you know, its not the same.&nbsp; Hence why i am waiting for the summer.&nbsp; If it works, it will be my first ever hallucinagenic experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve tried most other &quot;social&quot; drugs but nothing really did anything for me.<br />I am curious though, what does it cost to get samples?&nbsp; I might be interested to try it in pill form also.

				Well he gave about 10 samples away for free, well, 0.01 bitcoin so he could get credit for sales on SR, but I know he will be selling oz of them for good prices. There are other vendors too that sell smaller amounts if you just want to try it. I&#039;ve never had shrooms before, but I&#039;ve tried salvia and LSD, still wana try 25i the most but there isn&#039;t really low-bulk blotters around (20-50)

				You just gotta look around the forum, specifically product offers, if you don&#039;t mind the risk of ordering from a new vendor, most will put up samples for reputable members :)
