				Hey, it happens. I remember hearing about how former Lions defensive back Bennie Blades had an argument that spilled into a strip club&#039;s parking lot... and then pulled a goddamn bazooka out of his trunk. :D

				There are many people who go hunting with grenade launchers.&nbsp; Sometimes a bullet isn&#039;t enough to stop a black bear.

What I like about SR is that it embodies a place where people can buy and sell drugs in the absence of other criminal activity (well, kind of). Most LE truly believe that almost everyone who uses drugs is morally corrupt and often pays for their drugs by committing other crimes, frequently violent ones. Of course this is bullshit, but having read through a lot of LE literature, seen interviews etc, it really is the psychological justification of their participation in the war on drugs. Sadly, the cross section of drug users that LE does have to deal with is a very poor representation of the whole, and it creates stereotypes that they generalize to all drug users. <br /><br />When you have guns being sold right alongside drugs, it only reinforces that belief that drug users are dangerous criminals who can only be managed by broad strokes of draconian force. I&#039;m sure it also makes it easy suggest that the Road facilitates terrorism etc, which is great for politicians who can then campaign on the perils of allowing deepweb activities to proceed unchecked. No good can come of it. I think SR has the opportunity to challenge the public stereotypes in a profound way, because it makes the drug trade a lot more transparent. &#039;Normal&#039; people could get on here and see that there are plenty of fully functional users of hard drugs, for instance. Perhaps they could realize that the drug use is not an inherently criminal activity, but rather something that consenting adults can engage without negatively effecting others. <br /><br />I need to develop these ideas more, but that&#039;s a start to them.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s a 37mm grenade launcher.<br /><br />They aren&#039;t capable of launching actual grenades. You use them for launching paint grenades, CS gas, etc.<br /><br />The only cool thing you can do with them is use a pretty neat little device that lets it shoot around 10 .22LR projectiles at one time. <br /><br />40mm grenade launchers are the ones that launch actual explosives.

				You can use Glock to protect yourself from burglar. To protect yourself from government, you need at least grenade launcher. 2nd amendment was not intended for hunting small animals, it was for citizens being able to keep government in check.
