				I&#039;m sorry but this is a retarded idea, please do not ever do this. First of all if you hate someone so much for doing something, why would you stoop to their level and do the same thing? Violence is not the answer to any problems, that would only stir up more shit. Also, we are not categorized into &quot;Drug users&quot; and &quot;Non drug users&quot; we are all human. Please do not be a dumbass, seriously wtf?

				I didnt say I was considering it. Just thought how easy it would be wondering why no one has done it. <br /><br />I may have worded things in a way that one may have inferred that I had plans as of such, but I dont even own a gun. No intent to do it, I couldnt murder. But a lot of folks could.

Any fool can shoot someone - it takes brains to outsmart and stay one step ahead of Law Enforcement.<br /><br />Also even when you take the morality aside, you know full well if you shot two Police Officers at a gas station, the place would soon be crawling with them. <br /><br />V.

Street cops would not be prepared to deal with. I have been on the wrong side of the hand cuffs a couple times and I am bitter about how much power guys with 6 weeks of training are given.<br /><br />Of course, the average person is probably incapable of hitting a human sized target at even 100 yards. The guy in the movie makes it look easy.

				It takes brains to make it so you don&#039;t need to stay one step ahead of law enforcement, but if you are happy just hoping you stay one step ahead and risking your life more power to you I guess. I think police are actually fairly worthless targets, they are the foot soldiers in the war. The generals are politicians and they are funded by corporations, although they also extort money from us to fund the war that they fight against us. The military of a nation generally aims for the generals and the means of funding the war machine, foot soldiers just get in the way of reaching these targeted objectives. Avoiding &#039;foot soldier&#039; combat is probably the most strategically sound idea, and it lends itself well to decentralized network warfare. Although demoralization and other PSYOP techniques would probably be beneficial. Decentralized war is very interesting, I suggest reading about Netwar if you are interested in learning more about it.
