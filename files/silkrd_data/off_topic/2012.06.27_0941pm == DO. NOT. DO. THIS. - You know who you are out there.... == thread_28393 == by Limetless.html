				Send me invites/ask why I do not come on to &quot;chat&quot;. You will get this response - <br /><br />&quot;Because I don&#039;t want to, sorry&quot;<br /><br />If you then feel the need to press me as to my reasons why or tell me why I should you will get this response -<br /><br />&quot;No I just don&#039;t want to do something that could potentially incriminate me and provide evidence that could allow law enforcement to suspend my freedom for a significant amount of my life. Now go away.&quot;<br /><br />1. Anyone who does this with a practically-fuck-all-post-count smells like Pork-Products to me. <br /><br />2. If you are genuine and curious as to why I don&#039;t then it is not your concern so please occupy your mind with other thoughts. <br /><br />That is all.

I talked about it with a vendor before who said they wouldn&#039;t use it. It strikes me that it&#039;s just a whole big box of security issues to me. <br /><br />And Oscar....you have rumbled me......I&#039;m off to the evidence room to cry now and do some seized Bing to cheer me the fuck up... :P

				Put it in your sig!<br /><br />And your right, some cops are trained in squeezing info out of people and journalists also.<br /><br />I&#039;m a lover of freedom also but not a vendor so don&#039;t give a shit as using is hardly going to get cops in the UK too motivated or funded.<br /><br />Anyhow - guess I will have to chat with the intellectual lightweights here.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D
