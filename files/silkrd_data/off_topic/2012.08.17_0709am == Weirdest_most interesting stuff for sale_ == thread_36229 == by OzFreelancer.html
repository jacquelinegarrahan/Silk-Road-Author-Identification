				Oh and the misspelling of my name is intentional, marketing thing.

				There was a guy on these forums selling Shrunken Heads. He had some kind of a connection with a coroner and was able to supply himself with closed casket / non-family cases. He refused to put up pictures since he believed it was a work of art not to be displayed for shock value over the internet. <br /><br />IIRC they were upwards of $1000 a Head and very intricate in their development (or un-development I should say).<br />
