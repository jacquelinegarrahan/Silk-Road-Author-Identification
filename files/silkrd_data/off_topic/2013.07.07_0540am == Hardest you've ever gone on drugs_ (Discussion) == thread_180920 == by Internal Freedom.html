				I&#039;m curious to see whats the hardest you guys have ever gone when doing any sort of drug, have you taken so much of something to the point where you didn&#039;t know who or where you were? Share your experiences ;D<br /><br />This is mine. I went way too hard and did a heroic dose of shrooms.<br /><br />I grew shrooms for a bit a while back, I grew a fairly potent Thai variety that produced decent yields and had nice fat caps. So naturally I had a lot of shrooms with nothing to do with them (I&#039;m not big on the whole &quot;selling&quot; thing, and I didn&#039;t know about SR at the time). I went through a period where I was taking shrooms every single week for a few months. After two or three months I started to get bad trips every single time I would take them, so I stopped for a while.<br /><br />After a month of not doing any psychedelics, I decided to do a hippy-flip (Shrooms + MDMA). I had some really good molly that came in nice sized crystals from a trusted friend of mine. I had done this MDMA before and I knew it was legit, no cuts or anything. I don&#039;t quite remember why, but I thought it was a good idea to do 10g of shrooms at once... Lemon Tekk&#039;d. As you guys probably know, soaking shrooms in lemon juice greatly potentiates them. I had experiences before with 8-10 gram doses, but they were always done just by eating them. I was NOT ready for this at all.<br /><br />I took about 125mg of MDMA and waited for it to kick in. After around 30 minutes I felt it slowly starting to work, so I immediately chugged back the disgusting lemon-shroom mixture that I let sit for 20 minutes before-hand. This is where it gets fucked, my first truly terrifying bad-trip ever which made me never want to take shrooms again.<br /><br />An hour had gone by now, and the shrooms hit me like a punch in the face. The euphoria from the MDMA immediately disappeared and I had an insanely hard time focusing on anything, my mind started racing and my thought were looping over and over. I looked at the ground and everything started spiraling, morphing and waving. I had extreme short-term memory loss and at one point I completely forgot I took shrooms and was trying to figure out what was happening to me (thoughts STILL looping at this point). I sat in a chair staring at the wall with a blank expression for two hours trying to think of what was happening to me, then forgetting what I was thinking about, then starting the process all over. I got up and walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I didn&#039;t recognize my own reflection and became even more terrified as the person in the mirror became distorted and wavy. I got into bed hoping I could fall asleep so I could get out of the hell I was in. It was at this point I started forgetting where I was.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how, but I managed to fall asleep. I don&#039;t remember much really. I ended up waking up at 4am in the morning, scared to death. I had no idea where I was, I had forgotten my own name and kept saying &quot;what the fuck happened&quot; and &quot;whats going on&quot; for a few minutes before passing out again. I woke up at 9am the next morning feeling kinda weird/hungover but other then that perfectly fine. Memory was back to normal and I could think straight again.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that I quit psychedelics for a few months. I guess this is a warning to not hippy flip on 10g+ of potent shrooms 8)<br /><br />The experience scared me for a while, but I ended up getting into DMT, LSD and 2C-B a bit and I still do psychedelics several times a month. They are still the most beautiful substances in the world and no bad trip will ever change that.<br /><br />Funny enough, I did shrooms ONCE after that bad trip and never had an interest to do them again. Ive done acid dozens of times since and DMT so many times I cant even count, but I just get a weird vibe when I think of taking shrooms. Even though I know I did a ridiculously large dose.<br /><br /><br />

				Good post. +1. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been awake for more than a week a few times on stimulants. Had some terrifying hallucinations from the sleep deprivation that I couldn&#039;t separate from reality. Makes me shiver just thinking about it, and I&#039;m stone cold sober right now.<br /><br />While I&#039;ve had some wild experiences on psychedelics, I&#039;ve almost always been able to realize that I was high and it wouldn&#039;t last forever. I did once eat more than a quarter of shrooms when we were camping, and there was part of the trip that I was outside myself and watching the wind and light from the fire and the creek and the stars. I was literally looking down at the scene for some period of time, basically an out of body experience. Later that night I was back to just tripping, laughing and joking with the guys and enjoying myself. All in all a fun time.<br /><br />But the first time I got strung out on crack, I went hard for about 7 months, every day. i held down a job and did OK for the first 5 months, but eventually I got fired and was running scams and even did a fairly substantial theft to support my habit. In the whole time, I only once fell asleep while in possession of some crack, and that was with the pipe in my hand after being up for about a week. I woke up after a few hours, and then proceeded to smoke crack for another 9 days without sleep. By the 7th or 8th day, I was having vivid hallucinations and paranoia bordering on psychosis.<br /><br />One night, my smoking partner and I went to the home of a couple who liked to rock. We were smoking in the basement, and then we got some powdered cocaine, so we were cooking it up in the hallway and in a bedroom. The next thing I remember they were pulling me out of the upstairs shower, water running, fully clothed. I had imagined, or hallucinated, or whatever. that the woman we were with had OD&#039;d, and that I was trying to revive her. Needless to say the rest of the people were still downstairs, there was no emergency, just me losing my mind. It basically scared everyone off the pipe for the moment, so I accompanied my partner back to his apartment, and we were talking about drug treatment or the emergency room.<br /><br />But soon enough, we were back on the pipe until we were both so fucking paranoid that we left his place and went to the home of a girl we knew but who was out of town. Some time later I was hiding in the walk-in closet holding the door shut from inside, expecting the SWAT team to boot the door in at any moment. Every time I took a hit, I&#039;d have the most realistic and frightening hallucinations. Hearing people talking, seeing shit out the windows. just the very edge of madness. <br /><br />It took me several years to be basically normal after that 7 month episode. I had intense flashbacks or deja vu or what have you for many years, and it kept me from touching coke or any stimulant for years. The memories of that time in my life have made me extra cautious in all sorts of ways, and also overly sympathetic and helpful to those who are strung out. I can&#039;t count how many friends and acquaintances I&#039;ve helped out with a place to dry out and rest for a few days, who showed up on the bus with nothing except a bad habit. For years I&#039;d give my number and email to strung out people I just met and say &quot;call if you ever need help.&quot;<br /><br />Live and learn I guess.

				Great lessons in this thread already. We should make sure we keep it as a warning/harm minimisation theme rather than a pissing contest to see who&#039;s done the most.<br /><br />For me:<br /><br />First time I tried a large dose of 2cb I was on xanax from the day before, but didn&#039;t occur to me this would affect it at the time. Obviously had very minor effects. One night after getting home drunk and in a destructive mood I decided to take 100mg (since my 40mg dose did fuck all and I wanted to get fucked up....)<br /><br />Do not ever do this.<br /><br />I literally completely lost my mind. I thought I was dead for a considerable period of time having flashbacks on some kind of sequence before my death involving a car accident while driving under the influence of drugs, then when I gained a little bit of senses back everything was fractured and blurred. I thought I was in a coma trying to break out etc.<br />I eventually managed to surface long enough to take some xanax to knock myself out of it but the first dose didn&#039;t really do it for me, however I was so confused I had no idea how much i&#039;d taken and was very mindful of the fact that administering any drugs in such a mental state is extremely dangerous so had to tough it out for a while longer as I was too paranoid about taking more in case I&#039;d already had more than i could recall.<br /><br />The body load was insane as well, aching muscles, unbelievable body temp and sweating....pretty sure I almost died.<br /><br />The other one was my first experience with meth. I have a very compulsive personality and I had a gram off SR. A little line to see what it was like turned into doing the entire gram in a night. Went into full psychosis on the comedown (got stuck doing the same thing for 6-7 hours over and over etc) I was so wired that a handful of benzos couldn&#039;t even bring me down.<br /><br />Took a good couple of days for the effects to completely wear off and I got the most severe crushing bout of depression for about a week afterwards as well.<br /><br />Not healthy!! Not Fun!! Definitely not something to be proud of.

				Would have to be a ketamine binge for me. I don&#039;t know exactly how much I used but once I spent about a month sniffing ketamine all day. I probably went through nearly 100 grams over a month though, toward the end I was sniffing probably 500mg+ per line every hour. Actually it stopped working almost entirely toward the end I could hardly k hole at all anymore. I also suffered from k pains through out the month, but kept at it, because I am hopelessly addicted to ketamine when I have it, and I was living with a friend who had a fuck ton of ketmaine and who let me use as much as I wanted. Pretty much my rule for ketamine these days is to not allow myself to be in possession of more than 5 grams at a time.

				About xmas time I went to a party and after numerous line of MDMA, MDA, Ketamine, Mephedrone and enough spliff to knock out a fully grown horse, some dick decided he would measure out the lines of 2C-B since he insisted he knew exactly what he was doing. Instead of measuring out the standard 6mg to 10mg dose of 2cb to snort, he must of laid out well over 50mg for each of us. We were all too fucked to noticed and railed the lines anyway. <br />I was handling it pretty well considering the dose but when I saw my mate freaking the fuck out shouting and head butting the wall, I just couldn&#039;t keep it together. The body load was horrific it felt like my shoulders were being stabbed, also I kept managing to get lost somewhere I knew like the back of my hand, super weird. <br />Be careful with 2cb folks as at high doses its pretty unforgiving.

From what I understand, the acidity of the lemon juice converts the Psilocybin into Psilocin (doing the same job your stomach acid does), when you drink the lemon-shroom &quot;shot&quot; the effects kick in within 15-20 minutes and hit you HARD. The overall trip length is apparently an hour less as a result, but its super intense for that whole time.<br /><br />So that means the 10g dose I did, was more like a 15-20g dose. Which is absolutely fucked, I have no idea what I was thinking. No wonder I lost my mind for a while
