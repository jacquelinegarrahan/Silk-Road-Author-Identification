				Oh MAN! Thanks for posting this. I was going to wait till Sunday before clicking order, because there&#039;s no post on the weekend, and the value of ฿s was just going up and up. I read this and hurried over to the mane site to see I had only an extra 0.21฿s above the cost of the item I was going to get. I purposely by an extra few coins and their value has just melted away (may go back up, you never know, I may have been too hasty!). I managed to place the order just in time thanks to you.<br /><br />You can have my extra 0.21฿s and +1 for that. :)<br /><br />EDIT: For some reason it kept saying I didn&#039;t have enough funds to send 0.21฿s? So I&#039;ve sent you 0.2฿s instead.<br />I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t help you out more.

				He&#039;s not lying when he says the ฿ price has dropped a lot. Today Intersango hit the £10 per ฿ mark!!! Now it&#039;s dropped to around £8.17 per ฿!!!<br />Maybe the bubble has burst IDK.

				It&#039;s not a loan, keep it. :)<br />Unless the value of ฿s rockets and 0.2 ฿s becomes worth £100, then you can pay it back (joking) ;D<br />Hope your order works out for you.
