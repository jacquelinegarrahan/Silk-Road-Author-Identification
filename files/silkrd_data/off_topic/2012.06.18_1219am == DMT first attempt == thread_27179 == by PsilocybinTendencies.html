				I just tried DMT for the first time.<br /><br />Result? Almost got somewhere, but didn&#039;t break through as expected.<br /><br />purchased this powder off a vendor decently reputed vendor. then bought one of those rose stems they sell for meth-smokers, because I don&#039;t have a vaporizer and didn&#039;t have the money to invest in one. I saw where there were instructions to take like a glass bottle with some steel wool, but I didn&#039;t fully understand how it worked in the end.<br /><br />I have zero experience smoking chemicals in a manner such as this.<br />but I had someone who is very experienced with smoking meth with me, and he applied his meth-smoking knowledge to my attempt at smoking dmt.<br /><br />I measured myself out 50 milligrams, give or take, put it into the stem, and heated it from the bottom, letting the flame get close, but not touch the glass. twisted the pipe back and forth as I was doing this until the vapor in the pipe was thick and sucked lightly. took in as much as I could handle, exhaled, repeated. <br /><br />The taste was just god awful. Easily the worst tasting thing I&#039;ve ingested in my life so far, but that&#039;s probably not saying much.<br /><br />I felt it come on quickly though. It overpowered my whole body, and made me dizzy. I had to lay down.<br />For the first couple minutes, it made me really nauseous, like I was about to throw up.<br /><br />After that subsided I just plain felt weird. Trip was definitely the correct word to describe it, but it the substance definitely has its own qualities.<br /><br />I felt incapacitated, like not in control of my body, and thought &quot;here we go, yessss.&quot; laid back and waited for visuals.<br /><br />nothing.<br /><br />just a strong as fuck body buzz for about 15 minutes at most (maybe, I think it did effect my perception of time). All in all, I did not enjoy the feeling.<br /><br />I figured maybe I didn&#039;t do enough. My chemical smoking experienced dude said it looked like I had a bit of a puddle left over, so I figured maybe the taste was so appalling the first time that I was unprepared to take in enough to make the trip work.<br /><br />So I waited 40 or so minutes. And tried again, adding about 30 more micrograms to the leftover puddle previously described.<br />This time I inhaled deeply, three good hits.<br />I wanted to puke really bad. Noxious tasting shit.<br /><br />It hit me harder this time. Noticeably so. I still feel it a little bit about now maybe 40-50 minutes after the second attempt. But still no visuals :(<br /><br />What do you suppose went wrong? I&#039;m guessing either the DMT sucked (I doubt this based on what I&#039;ve been reading on the forums and such), I did something wrong in taking it (much more likely, I&#039;m a complete noob to this substance), or I have a strong genetic resistance to visuals (it takes me ALOT of acid to get visuals, and I took about 13 mg 2c-p quite some time ago and didn&#039;t hallucinate, and I definitely felt this experience pretty good...).<br />

				The taste you&#039;ll get used to. As for the technique of smoking it, what I do is take a few deep breaths, then blow all of the air out of my lungs, suck it back in and blow it all out again. Once you have no air in you at all and are wanting to gasp for breath, light the glass and inhale. Hold it for 7 seconds, blow it out and repeat 2 or 3 times or until you are too disoriented to light it anymore.

				50mg should send you into space, i really don&#039;t understand why you didnt get any visuals.<br /><br />personally i think a meth/freebase pipe is the best device for DMT but you need to know how to use one to avoid wasted DMT, burning DMT and painful hits.<br /><br />here is how i do it:<br /><br />20-30mg in a freebase pipe just like you have<br />heat the bottom of the pipe for a second with a torch style lighter (don&#039;t use a normal lighter!) so the DMT turns to liquid<br />let the DMT cool and solidify again, should only take a minute.<br />now go lie down somewhere and let your body go limp, make sure you are comfortable in this position and you&#039;re not too cold/warm.<br />make sure you have somewhere to place your hot pipe and lighter or have a sitter to take them from you. <br />when you&#039;re ready in one motion bring the pipe to your mouth and the lighter below it and start inhaling slowly, the key is to start inhaling before it beings to vaporize as if you vape a load of it and in hale a huge load in one go it will burn like hell and taste like shit which will make inhaling more and holding it much harder.<br />once you have inhaled for about 2-4 seconds (it should of completely vaped clean) put the pipe and lighter down while continuing to inhale slightly, then hold it for as long as you want or can.<br /><br />25mg is generally enough for a breakthrough dose for me.<br /><br />

				Thanks ultra that was useful! I noticed a couple things I was doing differently.<br /><br />I was using a regular lighter, and was letting the smoke build up before taking a toke.<br /><br />Ill try changing those things tomorrow and see how it goes.

				Your experience is about the same as mine. Got 50mg from Buddhanature and after several hits I felt a come up, could feel it sort of moving up my spine and my ears started ringing, laid down just as you did thinking here we go. But all I got was my face becoming numb and then slowly it all began to go away. I had no visuals or anything, but I did have sleep deprivation like I had tripped on LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried it in the past smoking out of a bong and didn&#039;t really have a full breakthrough, I had like a mini breakthrough, it was sort of like a quick dream, I used to have a similar experience as a kid if I passed out from having the wind knocked out of me. I was told I was literally out for a few seconds, it felt like a minute maybe, nothing even remotely similar to when others describe their breakthrough.<br /><br />Dimitrispice is very knowledgeable about DMT, and he has a good guide on his site for making the glass vaporizer (called DMT Machine on his site) http://426bznbgjzwd2nhp.onion/<br /><br />He also sells changa which I plan on trying for my next attempt to breakthrough.

				My product came from BuddhaNature as well, Meister.<br /><br />I tried to order from DiMiTriSpice, but gave way to impatience on day five in processing.<br /><br />I do know that if that&#039;s DMT, I can&#039;t handle freebasing enough to get the amazing visuals that everyone and their mom writes home about.<br /><br />I think if I get the itch to try it again, I might just eat the DiMiTri wait-time and go for the Pharmahuasca. that way I get to just eat a pill that oughta be enough to make me trip.

You just smoke it out of a bong or pipe like weed, can&#039;t get any easier than that.

				I personally can not smoke freebase on it&#039;s own, it just never seems to work for me. I&#039;ve tried it with a freebase pipe, a vapor genie, and the machine, just can&#039;t seem to get where I want to go. It also doesn&#039;t help that I seem to be ridiculously resistant to pretty much all psychedelics.<br /><br />DMT enhanced herb, be it real changa or even just DMT infused parsley or something, works great for me. It makes it a lot easier to smoke and it doesn&#039;t feel as harsh. Even just smoking it via the sandwich method through a regular pipe seems easier on the lungs to me.

				I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll ever get as deep using changa.<br /><br />DMT is all about stuffing in as much as you can in a short time span.<br /><br />Take a big rip, and as you&#039;re exhaling you should already be thinking about the next rip. Don&#039;t even think about whether it&#039;s affecting you or not. Leave that until after the bowl is gone. Once the bowl is gone is when you let it set in.<br /><br />My recommendation for all you having trouble is simply to use a bong or a pipe with some tea leaves in it and the DMT on top. Bring the lighter in slowly until the DMT melts. Then, once it&#039;s melted, rip away. Seriously, just keep ripping until you don&#039;t even know what a bong or a lighter are.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Oh and I was smoking the $hit off foil, like meth.<br /><br />Make a tiny cup out of foil, drop some $hit in, heat to liquid, suck up the vapor with a straw.....Proceed directly to tripping your a$$ off
