				So, I have $80 sitting in my wallet on SR right now, I usually try to spend my balance dry, but after BTC fluctuations and such, I ended up with this much leftover after a few orders.&nbsp; Looking for suggestions on what to spend it on!&nbsp; Don&#039;t be afraid to shamelessly plug your own products, vendors :P<br /><br />All in all, I&#039;m more of a classical psych fan: L, mdma, mda, kitty, etc. are all my regular drugs-of-choice.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have any experience (knowingly) with most RCs.&nbsp; I don&#039;t own a .0001 scale, so I&#039;m hesitant to order any 2c-xx&#039;s.&nbsp; I&#039;m no longer an herb smoker, so THC products or other synthetic cannabinoids are out.&nbsp; Might be curious about trying mephedrone or methylone.&nbsp; I enjoy ketamine, but I&#039;m not completely sold on MXE (maybe you can convince me?).&nbsp; <br /><br />While i&#039;m usually a mdma crystal eater, it&#039;s been awhile since I actually consumed some XTC pills, so I haven&#039;t had any of the current popular stamps.&nbsp; Maybe a handful of pills?

				Hi Slyboots.<br />Personally I was looking for alternatives that are difficult to obtain in my immediate area as well. I would recommend DMT, 5-meo,dmt, or an ayahuesca brew (DMT with an enzyme inhibitor so that the effect slowly settles in).&nbsp; <br />Also I enjoy the occasional tweak on some amphetamine, high doses of ADHD meds really get you going (100-200mg) but seem to be extremely expensive here so I would recommend against.<br />Perhaps a small batch of MDVP would elicit a wonderful time, though must be consumed with care as tendency to redose is very high.

				Are you in the USA or Canada? If so, you should wait until Sunday night and buy one of USAshroomz chocolate bars. 1/4 of a bar will have you tripping harder than you ever have before, and the packaging will make you smile.

				I&#039;ve also never tried GHB, as it was never around in my area.&nbsp; Might be interested in trying that out, but I&#039;m not sure yet...<br /><br />If mescaline wasn&#039;t so pricey I would be all over that.&nbsp; Only had one true mescaline experience so far.

				Some mushrooms?<br /><br />I usually just use the UK liberty cap but have not saved up a stash of dried in recent years as its a once a year thing now and always camping!<br /><br />So some shrooms.<br /><br />Maybe a few diazepam also. Cheap enough.

				4-aco-dmt looks interesting, though I&#039;d have to rely on my .001 scale for dosage. <br /><br />I&#039;m also browsing pills.&nbsp; I already have more xanax than I know what to do with, but other benzos intrigue me as I have less experience with them.<br /><br />As far as ketamine, I currently have a bit of lonely kamel&#039;s on hand, and a 5g order of ivory&#039;s kitty just ordered, so I&#039;m fine on kitty.<br /><br />

				Is 4-Aco-DMT really that much like shrooms? I thought 4-aco was basically like a regular non-breakthrough DMT dose that lasts longer. <br /><br />It just confuses me that they are listed as shrooms
