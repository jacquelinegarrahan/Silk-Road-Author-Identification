				Yep your right<br /><br />Authorities in the US have reportedly frozen a mobile payments account associated with Bitcoin exchange MtGox, as part of an investigation announced Tuesday. Dwolla, an Iowa-based mobile payment startup, confirmed to Betabeat Tuesday that it has halted all activity associated with the account belonging to MtGox, after receiving a warrant from the Department of Homeland Security. A spokesperson for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) later told CNET that an investigation is underway, though she declined to comment on its scope or nature.

				MtGox says it is aware of reports of the investigation, though the company says it has yet to receive a court order or warrant.<br /><br />&quot;[A]s of this time we have not been provided with a copy of the court order and/or warrant, and do not know its scope and/or the reasons for its issuance,&quot; MtGox said in a statement published to its Facebook page late Tuesday. &quot;MtGox is investigating and will provide further reports when additional information becomes known.&quot;
