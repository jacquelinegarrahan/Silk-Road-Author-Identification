				Just stop?&nbsp; Your mind isn&#039;t fully developed and if you&#039;ve got the &quot;want&quot; to stop, then just stop.&nbsp; If you go to rehab or whatever, it&#039;ll still be all up to you and your will to want to quit.&nbsp; So why waist the time and money on that shit.&nbsp; Or take Ayahuasca and have a life changing event.

				I have no experience with Opiates but i&#039;m just gonna say something anyway..<br /><br />When you are sure, when you want to get out, make a promise that you will, because the addiction will get <br />worse... I know its not easy for shit! I can imagine its the best drug ever, I badly want to try it, just to chase the dragon, but i know I&#039;ll go further than that...<br /><br />Anyways, again, when you know you want to stop, the time will come, try your best not to drag it for so long, otherwise you&#039;ll end up not chasing a high but chasing for a fix... Go to the amazon forest, they have those vacation ayuhuasca trip things. Go for it man, its apparently quite different from Smoking DMT (I&#039;ve smoked it and its amazing), btu ayhuasca stays longer in your system since you drink it with a MAOI, until the inhibitor stops, then only the DMT in the drink will stop and be broken down... <br /><br />From there you can focus and what not, it should help. And maybe find an alternative? Smoke loads of weed maybe?

				When i was 20 i tried H, its very available where i live so there,s a lot of addicts. I looked around at these people who were running about doing whatever to whoever to get money, stopped it there and then because i didn,t want to end up like them. Half of them are dead now or had a stroke and some are still going, mostly in and out prison! I think that should be enough if to make anyone stop if you have a brain&nbsp; ;)

				I did heroin every weekend for about 5 months.&nbsp; Never got addicted.&nbsp; I hated that shit, its the most disgusting foul substance I ever put in my body.&nbsp; I only did it cuz i was dating this guy at the time, I still think he was the one.&nbsp; We smoked, then we tried out morphine pills, loved them, worked our way to percs, then oxys.&nbsp; Once the oxys got too expensive he came home from work one day and he said lets try this stuff.&nbsp; It all started when his junkie coworker started working with him.&nbsp; Because I was &quot;so in love with him&quot; i figured i do heroin because I didnt wanna be left out. He got addicted to it, full blown.&nbsp; He did it everyday, when I only did it with him on weekends.&nbsp; It was disgusting seeing him go from a human being to an addict.&nbsp; I dumped him because I was about to start a very prestigious college and he was in his own little world.&nbsp; He ended up behind bars over 12 times in less than 9 months and his addiction took a huge toll on my self being.&nbsp; He almost died in my car once, and I drove him to rehab about 8 times when i would come home from college.&nbsp; He saw his coworkers family walk out on him and dessert him like an abandoned dog.&nbsp; He saw his &quot;friend&quot; lose everything and he would tell me he didnt want that to be him, but he let that happen so easily.<br /><br />Dumping him and making him get the fuck out of my life was the best decision.&nbsp; Heroin is disgusting and I feel sorry, not pitty, but really feel sorry for everyone and anyone that enjoys heroin.&nbsp; I really hope you dont jump on my ex&#039;s bandwagon cuz once you go down, youll never come back up. <br /><br />Heroin users are also judged so easily and so many people out there share the feelings as I do about heroin.&nbsp; There are better drugs out there that make you trip and make you feel great, just go out there and look for them instead of getting stuck under one. <br /><br />If I could I would go back in time and get rid of tihs guy from my life, because my college experience, well for two years was ruined because of him.&nbsp; I will never be the same person as I used to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />But i do love my mdma and psychedelics and buuuuud! <br /><br />Good luck man, I dont know you, but I really hope you can handle that heroin like I did and not end up in jail, looking gaunt, having your family and your whole life walk out on you.&nbsp; Even after all that happens, youll prob be too blind to see past the heroin that you have nothing to live for.&nbsp; Much love, and good luck!

				@TrippinOnHunger I think you misunderstand he reasons a lot of people try heroin. My personal problem with opiates extended from emotional trauma. I find alot of people who do opiates used to be completely cut off of from their feelings of pain. In cases of severe depression, sadness and anxiety can be an awful oppressive ever present feeling. Opiates provide a short break where were you are free from those oppressive feelings. Even though this person may have seemed fine to you, people do not always share trauma with people, even those closet to them. This is also why it is so easy for people to fall into addiction, where you are taking psychedelics to have fun and have a good time, many people are taking opiates to free them selves from having an awful time. Many people who use opiates in this way are not in an appropriate mental state for such psychedelic adventures. <br />Op I would caution you to think long and hard about the deeper reasons you feel you use opiates, self medicating the way I was talking about can lead you to some awful places and your desire to not feel the effects of trauma will eventually cause even more trauma in you life. <br />If you are young get out while you are&nbsp; young, the longer you stay in that life style the less likely it is you will ever stop. It is possible, I no longer use opiates, but it took me a long time of being clean from them before I realized how they have highjacked my life and my thought process.

				Thanks for the replies everyone and Trippin.&nbsp; Yeah I&#039;m very familiar with opiates at this point in our relationship to know that they&#039;re powerful and easily take over people&#039;s lives that let them... Myself included at times, but not to the degree of a stereotypical addict.<br /><br /><br />Really hoping to hear a first person account.<br />

				I&#039;m 23. Introduced to opiates in many of their forms a couple years ago. Never have binged more than a day or two. Always bang. I know their love and it&#039;s the best you&#039;ll find, but I choose to only buy in small amounts every once in a while. Keeps me at a minimum usage I find.<br /><br />- IW

				Started on it when I was 21. I was very reckless at the time and wanted to try any experience I could get my hands on. Managed that run for three years, usually only weekends. I watched the people around me start to turn into heavy duty junkies and then they started to drop dead. Eventually I realized chipping wasn&#039;t leading me anywhere good and I walked away, it&#039;ll be 5 years in December.
