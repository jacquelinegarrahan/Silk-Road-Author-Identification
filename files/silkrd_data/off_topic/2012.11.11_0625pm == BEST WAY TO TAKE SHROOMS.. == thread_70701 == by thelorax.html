				the way i do it.. is that i drop about 2 maybe 3 grams in a coffe filter.. then turn on a coffee machine...<br /><br />straight up.. perfect..it doesnt boil it. but it does it by drop by drop.. so the process really takes its time to whip out say 8 oz<br /><br />just add your favorite tea mix.. preferable them unsweetened ones.. for sum reason sugar makes it lose at lot more FUNK !<br /><br />if not.. just mush it up and eat it straight..<br /><br />if u respect the shroom enought not to fear its taste.. u wont trip out thinkin u will die.. when the ego break through happens

				I got some coming next week and this has been helpful thank you all.<br /><br />It&#039;ll be my first shroom experience and will be eating some PE strain. I don&#039;t really have any idea about how I will be getting them down. I like to do stuff straight up tho so I got it in my head to just eat them raw and chase it with something to drink. There sure are a lot of people saying they taste bad to the point of causing a gag reaction. There&#039;s also people saying that they threw up during their trip but I been dying to see what all this hype about shrooms are and now I&#039;ll get to find out real soon.

				Just chew them up and swallow, if you have bad gag reflex then you might want to do something like shoxmaxim12 said. <br />They not the best tasting things in the world but it&#039;s easily tolerable unless you just have horrible gag reflex to an earthy taste.

				tea is strongest method iv found, it gets the best out of the shrooms if u cant eat them, but u should be dosing at least 7-15g buddy to have a real nice trip...&nbsp; :)<br /><br />15g fresh chopped shrooms on a pizza, is an easy way to eat them...<br /><br />whatever u decide to do, enjoy your trip buddy...&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />regards...

				Chop them in yoghourt. May sound silly but really it&#039;s not. Yoghourt takes all the bad taste away...It&#039;s been my favorite method ever since I discovered this like...3-4 years ago!

				Anyone think shrooms taste good?<br /><br />I&#039;ve picked 2 different psychoactive species in the wild, and had them both fresh and dried; I thought they tasted pretty good, sort of like portobello mushrooms you&#039;d put on a steak.

				typicaly if you like mushrooms in general then youll love them. where as i, and many others find them utterly repulsive. taste texture smell everything about them. fresh or dried. GROSS GROSS GROSS lol. but all the post mentioned grat ways to ingest. w.e it is you truly enjoy. just be sure to dice and mince them if fresh or crsh grind and dust them if dried. i made a tea the other day, i use about 4 or 5 grams dried per 8oz of water, bring the water to a boil let cool and simmer on lowest setting till warm enuf to dip your finger in with out geting burned, drop in the diced or dusted mushies let sit for about fifteen min it will turn blueish, then sift and strain the matter from the blue mush water, only if you find them as gross as i do, otherwise leave it. be sure to ring the excess juice from the mush matter witha coffee filter as not to waste any good psyilicibin. then i preffer to use some lemon zinger tea bags cause then i also put lots of fresh lemon juice, some sugar and your set. i find also the lemon juice makes you roll faster and harder blwoing up quick due to all the vitamin C. goodluck!

				When making tea I always let the water cool down a little before adding your dried shrooms, I forget the psilocybin degradation temperature I&#039;ll have to find it later on. When you trip on shrooms it&#039;s not really the psilocybin that makes you hallucinate, once it enters the stomach it is converted to psilocin which then enters the bloodstream to the brain and you begin to trip. When placed in very acidic/basic conditions psilocybin is converted into psilocin. I prefer to squeeze some fresh lemons into a small cup and weigh out 2g of dried psilocybe subaeruginosa (p.subs) - these are one of the most potent mushrooms from Aus. Once the dried (or finely chopped fresh) mushrooms have been added to the cup place a plate or clingwrap over the lid so it becomes air tight. Psilocin is very unstable and reacts with oxygen, so to ensure you get maximum potency, make sure its air tight! Let it sit for 10 minutes or so and its ready to be consumed. I prefer to prepare another cup with my favourite tea and a dollop of honey, and then pour my lemon/psilocin mixture into the tea and quickly drink it. The beauty of preparing your psilocin in this lemon mixture is you can add it to any drink of your choice and you don&#039;t need much lemon juice to get good results. If you intend to try out this method please use fresh lemons, and none of that preservative/additive filled crap from the supermarkets. Using this method is like smoking amphetamine rather than snorting it: it hits you quicker and harder, but generally doesn&#039;t last as long, so its down to personal preference.<br /><br />Very quick, very easy:<br /><br />1. squeeze freshly picked lemons into a cup<br />2. add &#039;x&#039; amount of dried/fresh mushrooms<br />3. Make the cup airtight with clingwrap/lid<br />4. Wait 15 minutes<br />5. Consume straight from the cup or pour into a drink of your choice (drinking the straight lemon mixture actually has a nice zing to it and isn&#039;t as bad as most think)<br />6. Sit back and enjoy the ride&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps<br /><br />Capz&nbsp; 8)&nbsp;

The strength of your trip is obviously controlled by the amount you eat, but each mushroom strain contains different potency. In Aus 2g&#039;s of dried P.Subs will give you quite a strong trip, whilst other strains in NSW would give only a very low/borderline mild experience with the same amount.

				I like to grind my shrooms down into small chunks. Than i melt down a hand full of chocolate chips in the microwave for about 45 seconds on a small plate. Than i mix the ground up shrooms with the melted chocolate and put it in the freezer for 20 minutes. After all of this you have a tasty mushroom chocolate bar. enjoy!
