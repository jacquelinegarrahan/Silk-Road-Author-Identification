				Life hasn&#039;t been going the way I planned and I just need to fucking get away from it all before I kill myself, seriously. I&#039;m willing to drive across the country, I can relay packages for you, I can work in a grow-op or start a grow-op for someone in a certain state, and if it comes down to it, even riskier stuff anywhere in the U.S. <br /><br />Any chance I&#039;d actually get work over the SR forums? 1 to a billion. Does typing this retarded shit out make me feel better? Only time will tell ..the fuck should I do with my life?!
