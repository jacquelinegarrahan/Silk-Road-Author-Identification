				Was busted like 6 months ago on stuff that had nothing to do with the silk road really. been on semi-probation for about six months. I was just wondering what had been going on. When I was still on these forums MXE was the big new thing and all. I was kind of wondering what good drugs were out there now and what drugs I could still do while passing the drug test I have to do again at some point this year.

				DMT, Mushrooms and psychedelics in general are typically not detectable in blood tests. Take care.

				Well, depending on your specific drug test.. you can probably do many things. Fentanyl doesn&#039;t show up on those bullshit tests for god&#039;s sake! Psychedelics, most anything synthetic.. I mean.. sooo many options. I used to take weekly ua for my asshole shrink and I was never bored. Stay away from pot, coke, amphetamines, morphine derivatives, barbs, benzos, and pcp for sure.<br />Otherwise just do some quick research on whatever you want to try before you order, that&#039;s the beauty of buying drugs online.<br />Drug tests, fie!&nbsp; :P

These have become more common as of late. In those tests fent is technically detectable as a non-morphine derivative.. however such piss and swab tests lack the sensitivity required to pick up the trace amounts of the substance in your body. <br />You are correct that a usual basic panel doesn&#039;t pick out synthetics, but even if it does it won&#039;t catch fent.
