				Alright, I recently picked up a small amount of crystal and dropped most of it onto sugar cubes. <br />I have 100mg left and I&#039;m trying to figure out what to do with it. I&#039;m not really interested in blotters.<br />These will be sold locally so don&#039;t have to worry about shipping difficulties or anything like that. <br />Anyone have any other good ideas aside from dissolving and dropping on candies?

				I&#039;d find someone as delusional as me to buy the said lsd crystal and have them FE and then I&#039;d not send them a package but a gloating PM on a hard lesson learned expensively.<br /><br />&gt;.&gt;<br />nomad

				Suggestions:<br />1. Make super-strong liquid - spray on public/political figures.<br />2. Apply to Eucharist in a church somehow.<br />3. Eat.

I remember a guy on here trying to sell lsd gummies awhile back, I might try and do something like that.
