				as you may know, in july, HP released their touchpad, which didn&#039;t really sell<br />last night, the price shot down to $99 for the 16gb model and $149 for the 32gb model<br />obviously they went out of stock immediately<br />today, somebody on ebay listed over 6,000 touchpads (16gb) for $119 BIN and they sold immediately (i timed it and he ended up selling about 500 every two minutes)<br />so<br />how many of you were lucky enough to get one for these extremely reduced prices?<br />i wasn&#039;t lucky enough to buy one directly from HP but i did buy one on ebay

				Its a shame. I have used web os from palm since it was invented a few years ago. Then palm sold out to hp. Web os really is the best mobile operating system out there. I recently broke my pre webos and replaced it with an android. webos is so much better, easier, etc. it just doesn&#039;t have the&nbsp; marketing and backing like android and apple have.<br /><br />I am seeing them on ebay for under 300 bucks. I am going to get one.&nbsp; I pretty much knew it wouldn&#039;t be adopted because of the ios and android/blackberry popularity. If you use one for a week, you will know what im talking about. just flip the app from the screen and its gone. you can have like 20 apps open at once too. shame. I hope they continue with the phones. What a great operating system and its getting bagged...

				webos was the shit when i had my pre and still in my opinion is a better os than either android or ios any day of the week, just the patching system and multi tasking were light years ahead of the rest, sadly the hardware wasnt so good and my pre is now dead (well sort of, i could easily solder a new power switch on but i have a new phone now) if they crop up cheap anywhere here in england i shall probably grab one too

				@chronicpain<br /><br />I kind of hope it is, then hopefully they will totally open source it and android can steal all its best features, although hp are supposedly getting out of the hw market to focus on software, so maybe finally webos licenced to any and all manufacturers and it will take its much deserved place at the top

				Not to be a dick but you might want to save your money for an iPad, the reason being the apps. Forget about the hardware, it&#039;s what you can run on it that matters. There are over 100,000 apps in the app store and a lot of them are free or have trial versions. You are really going to miss out on a lot of cool stuff if you buy the HP.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Oh, I will get an ipad as well. There are lots of great programs already made for webos. I just want one to use for video and other things. If I can get below 200 bucks, it will be well worth it. So, if anyone sees one that is below 200 bucks, please let me know.. I want the 32gb version. They should be around the 150 dollar price, but as long as its close to that is all that i care about.. <br /><br />But, yea, I wouldn&#039;t pay 500 or whatever they wanted, just for the plain fact that the majority of the programs wont be available to me, but 150? ill take one....
