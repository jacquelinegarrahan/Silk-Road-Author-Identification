				During the 2nd debate Romney was not answering questions directly but instead was more concerned with promoting his agenda. On the other hand, Obama was answering questions very well, and did a great job of counter-punching.

				Really I know your going to life at me when I say this, but LulzSec type of group needs to come back. I think Trolling the election and demostrating that the people with the real power are people that understand technology. Thats what the anon Movement was about. LulzSec just took it more destructively. Really I dont understand why there isnt a movement to protest whats going. Republicians Talk about how the government is corrupt, but yet its ok to fuck over Ron Paul for the sake of Romney. Thats corruption right there. Obama and the going green failures, yea I mean that pretty odvious too. No serious investigation, just get reported and people move on. Its sucks because If I was a private corp, and did that to investors. I would be in prison. Its just really sad oh people dont care. And I feel like I have no where to go. Because I dont want to get covered in bullshit.

				OK so right now we have the choice realistically between two candidates and a pipe dream for a third. obama and Romney aren&#039;t very far from being the same person, and Gary Johnson is different, but since he was not allowed in the debates, nobody knows what he would do in the oval office. All that aside, and us Americans are voting between the two evils, we have the choice to vote libertarian. I an very in line with the libertarian agenda, but it scares me that libertarian votes are votes sometimes being pulled away from Obama because they are voting to change the status quo. This gives republicans an advantage, even though the majority of people who vote libertarian (in my area at least) would choose Obama as a second choice. Now these people vote based upon what they believe, and I believe in what the libertarian party is selling, but I do NOT think we are ready for that kind of real change. That isn&#039;t like changing your socks, It&#039;s like learning to make yarn to knit your own fucking socks yourself overnight. Now to my point. I am 100% PRO Gary Johnson, but I will not waste my vote on him because I not only don&#039;t think we are ready for that kind of change, but also I DON&#039;T FEEL that enough people will waste their vote on him to stir a fuss....what if a libertarian got 3 electoral votes? to they just call it a tie then? or do they take the libertarians out back with a hose till they are republican votes :) <br /><br />Anyway. I support Johnson, but voting Obama for one simple reason. When I look into Obama&#039;s eyes on TV I see something in there that means well, and when I look into Mitt&#039;s...I wonder what he sees when he looks into the mirror.<br /><br />love you guys all.<br />be back in about a week, takin some time off from this online thing.<br /><br />wretched<br /><br />afterthought: please someone write in wretched on your ballot and post a picture of it (if you can) up here to brighten my day a bit :)

I&#039;m not voting for Gary Johnson solely because he would make a better president, its also a stance to the major candidates that my vote cannot be bought. If these third parties get just 4% of the popular vote their idealogies are forced to be mentioned on the news. This entire race there hasn&#039;t been one mention of the drug war and its negative impacts on society. I want Obama to be challenged with it until we finally get his view on it. The best way to do it is to participate in the election and show whoever is elected that I will stand by my viewpoints even if the major parties will not.<br /><br />Even in the event of Johnson winning (which is near impossible) it doesn&#039;t mean a new America will exist on day one. He still needs to legislate all of his views and they need to pass through congress. Its more likely we would just get an American that leans closer in the direction of libertarianism than a new democracy.

				I think Gary Johnson will take a surprising percentage of the votes this election. Not likely enough to win, since third party candidates aren&#039;t even able to participate in the debates - which is a new level of fucked up. Hopefully one day we can stop bipartisan and make sure every candidate has an equal chance. <br /><br />Though out of Romney and Obama, I would prefer Obama to win.

				Obama is by no means &quot;less evil&quot; than Romney. Everyone claims to want change, yet they allow the same one party system to get elected, and yes, democrats and republicans are the same, it is only a matter of how they choose to waste OUR money, which doesn&#039;t even vary that greatly from each other. You want things to be right in this country, you want freedom, civil liberties? You vote Ron Paul or Gary Johnson, there are no other options plain and simple guys.

				It just occurred to me... any way Johnson is a Republican plant in order to syphon votes from Obama? I like him, but will vote Obama. The fact that I like him makes me skeptical though.
