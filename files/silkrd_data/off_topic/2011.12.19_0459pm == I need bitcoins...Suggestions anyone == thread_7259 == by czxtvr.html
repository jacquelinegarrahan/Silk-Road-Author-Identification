				I am really having a really hard time with this bitcoin ish.&nbsp; I was&nbsp; so excited when i first arrived at this site. I thought it was very promising. I thought that I would be able&nbsp; to come&nbsp; here purchase my&nbsp; meds and everyone&nbsp; would be happy. Fat chance, all hell has broken loose.I have been scammed out of several hundred dollars and still can&#039;t get in on the action.....This was my last&nbsp; hope. I have nowhere else to turn and i&#039;m about to tap out with this place if i don&#039;t find help soon.....Can Someone&nbsp; Please Help Me?

				Try BTCBank here on the forums. Not on the SR main site yet but great and very fast for moneypak and many other methods of exchange.

				If you have been scammed and are trying to avoid that, I would steer clear completely of Moneypak to Bitcoin transactions.&nbsp; Sure there are reputable vendors that will do it, and I have myself done it successfully.&nbsp; However, once you get into that sort of transaction you have NO way to protect yourself, and you are in a spot where it is very easy for a reputable vendor to decide to keep your Moneypak and give you jack shit in return, it happens.<br /><br />Link your bank account to Dwolla, transfer cash to Dwolla, transfer cash from Dwolla to Mtgox, buy your bitcoins, transfer them to your SR account.&nbsp; All in all this process takes about 5-6 days, so plan ahead.<br /><br />Dwolla did just add an instant deposit feature which will mean buying BTC instantly!&nbsp; There is a $3 per month fee for this service, but that is already cheaper than buying the $5 Moneypak.<br /><br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me asking, how did you get scammed and from who?

				i agree with thisisatest!&nbsp; i do the same and it costs very little in the end.&nbsp; just make sure you send to an e-wallet after mt gox before SR.&nbsp; (dunno if he said that or not).&nbsp; might be paranoid but it&#039;s a layer of security.&nbsp; i use instawallet.&nbsp; <br />takes a week for dwolla to take ur money (and u have to link ur account which takes awhile too).&nbsp; but i like the delayed gratification.&nbsp; once in dwolla it only takes an hour to funnel the bc to SR.&nbsp; <br />i used moneypak to bc once and it worked fine for me but it took days of wrangling with vendors and rejections and being ignored cause it was such a small amount (only 45 US).&nbsp; now i just load dwolla when i get paid and by the time those Bcs go in i&#039;m expecting a package from my last purchase so it&#039;s all graaavy.<br /><br />*destiny*

				<br />Thanks thisisatest for sharing that info with me. I was scammed by SR Discount Pharmacy. I tried to use a moneypak and he just ran off with my money and sent out nothing. Is there another way to obtain bitcoins without connecting it to my bank account? And where do I find this BTC bank here on the forum?

				Where are you located? UK, US, EU, Asia or somewhere else? Depending on where you are located and what currency you use can make it more or less difficult to acquire Bitcoins.<br /><br />I&#039;m UK based and I use intersango which is really easy and has good rates.
