				Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but isn&#039;t the sole purpose of a captcha to prove to the server that the being logging in is actually human? i.e. to prevent automatic / scripted logins ? i don&#039;t think it has anything to do with security for the user.

Classic.<br /><br />Yeah, actually. SR Captcha messes with me too now and again. I can&#039;t recall anything specific at the moment but I&#039;ve definitely lol&#039;d at a few of them. Sometimes I&#039;ll also get a really ominous one along the lines of &quot;jail169&quot;.<br /><br />

				I LOVE trying to make a full word out of my 4 or 5 letters that I get every time. It&#039;s like they choose real words and just use the first 5 letters. <br /><br />I&#039;ll get:<br /><br />&quot;GORIL&quot; and I&#039;ll think &quot;LA!&quot;<br />&quot;SMIL&quot; and I&#039;ll think &quot;EY!&quot;<br />&quot;SCRIB&quot; and I&#039;ll think &quot;BLE!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s so funny you&nbsp; made this post because I have thought that so many times...

				Yeah. They are full word cut short with 3 numbers at the end. I am just glad to be able to actually read them. The actual &quot;capcha&quot; brand ones are soooooooo hard to read :/
