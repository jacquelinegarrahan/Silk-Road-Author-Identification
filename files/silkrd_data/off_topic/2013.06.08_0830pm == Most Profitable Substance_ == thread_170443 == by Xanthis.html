				What is, in your opinion, the most profitable illicit substance on Silk Road that you can (realistically) be your own supplier of?<br /><br />Curious as to the consensus.

				I would guess that it is heroin or cocaine, mainly due to the fact that its very rare the substances are pure and the price in the nations that produce these drugs is VERY cheap! <br /><br />I have been to a few South American countries and the price there was maybe 10-15,000 UK pounds for a kilo. So, if you had relatives back home who could buy the uncut coke from the lab then you would make 120,000 including the package and postage.<br /><br />Heroin, I don&#039;t know much about it but I guess its about the same.<br /><br />I think a lot of stuff comes into the UK via family connections back home. I would never use heroin so would certainly never sell it.<br /><br />As for selling cocaine, I leave that to those who accept the risk that goes with it.<br /><br />Although over 100,000 profit might sound a bit too much, the risk taken justifies the profit.<br /><br />I have never smuggled cocaine although its very tempting with the quality and price in places like Mexico or Columbia.<br /><br />Sending a bit back by post sounds the best option!<br /><br />

				Strictly from prices on the road, 25 i-nbome. Costs~ 30 cents a dose and you can sell em 5-10$ a dose. Only difficult part is getting a user base as you build tolerance too much for people to use it regularly. Other than that I would say MDMA or M1. Costs ~200$ for 10g (67-100 doses) which you can sell .1g- .15g for $20 a piece in clubs/festivals ($1340-$2000)

				If you mean selling on the road then LSD.&nbsp; A hundred doses costs less than a penny to produce. :)<br /><br />You can lay nine thousand and ninety one 110ug blotter tabs with one gram of LSD crystal.&nbsp; Or you can lay a bible of 100ug hits.

				I would also kill to offer the purest cocaine. If this was at all possible I would assume that I could go to La Paz, Bolivia to seek out a supplier.

				I&#039;m certain that nobody who has posted is capable of synthing their own LSD or even sourcing their own grams for that matter.<br /><br />Notice OPs use of the word &quot;realistically&quot;. He means something that you are actually capable of doing if you wanted to.<br /><br />Of course LSD is probably the most profitable item if you can get it from the source. Everyone knows this. <br /><br />And weed isn&#039;t so illegal or such hassle everywhere. Some parts of the US and Canada you don&#039;t have those &quot;security&quot; limits you speak of. It can be very profitable for some.<br /><br />

				You have to think about other factors if you actually plan on putting this into action, such as buying in bulk can be expensive to start unless you already have a somewhat large sum to invest in drugs.<br /><br />Id say coke is your best bet because its a good deal in bulk, you have a guaranteed market (that is probably growing every day) and its a sched II not schedule I drug in USA idk about elsewhere, so if you get caught its not as bad as getting busted with acid. <br /><br />I cant wait for the day where i see sheets for $500 and consistent...fingers are definitely crossed to see that soon.

				Dude, I bought like 10 grams of 25I-NBOMe and it was the purest fucking nbome I have ever seen, I mean pure white crystals, no tan or light brown color!? Custom synthed from china for like a couple hundred bucks, paired that with some HPBCD and laid 100 STRONG ass blotters and currently selling those for no cheaper than a hundred bucks a sheet, thats over 1000% profit in case your not too good at math, and I&#039;ve kickstarted the marketing of it to where I am almost getting rid of 10 sheets every 2 to 3 weeks, bank bank bank bro! Also, Mushrooms! If you can learn to grow some mushrooms with even just an 80% success rate, which I do not think is very hard if you pay good attention to small details. You can literally grow a pound of mushrooms in like a month for literally less than 100 bucks, thats over 1000% profit too, with a little more work, but mushrooms are the bomb! I actualy just ordered some penis envy live cultures in a syringe, cant wait to get those suckers goin =) The only way you could even get close to those profit margins is synthesizing your own drugs, which most people dont do (hence why drugs are so expensive... lol) Man if I could get my hands on even just like 200 milligrams or 100 milligrams of some pure LSD crystal I would be fucking straight Wadlley Toddely! whatever the hell that means

				Well this question has too many variables to be answered properly.<br />You could grow opium and produce your own heroin, or grow weed, or synthesize LSD or cook meth or MDMA.<br />There are so many things to consider. Or would you just buy product from a supplier.<br /><br />Do you work it out per gram or per hour of effort involved?<br /><br />LSD crystal is something like $15,000,000 / kg but that would produce millions of doses.<br />But how would you distribute that? No easy task, even with silk road connecting millions of drug sellers and users.<br /><br />It depends where you live too. <br />For me living in Australia the most profitable thing would be to grow my own weed and sell it, but that involves quite a risk.<br />Importing MDMA for $20 / gram and selling it in Australia f or the average price here ($250 / gm) would be the easiest money though.

				Hmm I&#039;m guessing cocaine. The profit margin from coca farmer to street vendorin EU is about 3000%.

				Do you mean specifically for a vendor or universally? <br />If specifically then anything a vendor produces or steals themselves, examples most opium vendors make almost 99% profit per gram sold as the only cost in acquiring is petrol money, some razor blades and a yoghurt pot. The risk and time though is on par with heroin or cocaine production. . If globally then probably crystal meth as the production cost is lower than most other drugs in the same 100$ up price range for pure. <br />ACE

				A little more detail about my last post.&nbsp; The whole bank robbing spree happened when they decided to steal a detectives cruiser while he was in the store.&nbsp; They got a shotgun, pistol and AR15 from the vehicle.&nbsp; They used that AR15 in every one of the 200 and some bank robberies.&nbsp; The cops knew that it was the stolen AR15 being used in the bank robberies and boy were they pissed.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t even catch the guys.&nbsp; Just sitting around all butthurt with their thumbs in their asses.&nbsp; Humorous to say the least ;D

				Ketamine can be extremely profitable and it also has the lowest risk. Any amount of ketamine cannot get you more than 10 years in prison. People importing kilos from India pay like $8-$12 a gram, I am not sure what it sells for here but I have seen it go for anywhere between $20 and $100 a gram, depending on the area. Best case scenario you make $92,000 for every kilo you sell, worst case scenario you make $8,000. I think average price for end users is somewhere around $50 a gram, so most people probably make about $40,000 for each kilo they sell. Not that bad for risking only 10 years in prison, especially since dogs cannot smell it. The demand is also very large and people go through it fast.

				I know somebody who made a total killing on pressing counterfeit xanax tabs. $5 a gram for pure powder means $5 per 500 2mg bars , sell the bars for $2 a pop.

				Whatever you can sell the most of really - whatever the people in your area like to use.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />A cocaine dealer over here in the UK, will mainly sell at the weekends - now lets say he sells an ounce every week in one gram deals... He will probably pay 800 pound if it&#039;s decent cocaine and let&#039;s say he isn&#039;t scummy and doesn&#039;t cut it. <br /><br />And sells it for 50 pound per g (average street price in the UK) he&#039;s just made 1400 pound, a profit of 600 pound. <br /><br />Now let&#039;s say the same guy sells weed at 10 pound per g - in my experience weed sells everyday. Almost all of my customers bought from me everyday.<br /><br />So he can easily clear an ounce of weed a day.. Which is 280 pound, and depending on the quantity he buys (lets say he buys seven - one to sell a day), he will get an ounce for roughly 120.<br /><br />280 x 7 = 1960 - What he earnt<br /><br />120 x 7 = 840 - What he paid for the weed<br /><br />Meaning (profit = 1120)<br /><br /><br />Which shows weed would make him more money on a week by week basis. AND there isn&#039;t as harsh a penalty if caught. People just always assume there is more money to be made with the &#039;harder&#039; drugs.<br /><br /><br />Ultimately it boils down to who you know, and what drugs they like to use and how frequently they will use the said drug. <br />

				I like Mr.Anonymous&#039; answer go with that shit man, do your research, find out whats best for you, do some work son! Work makes money, questions just make answers, not money =p I guess they can help you make money sometimes... But sometimes I really feel like your either born a money maker or your not. Sometimes it just seems like the older I get, the more fucking random ass dolla billz I end up with from not trying much harder than years ago.

				Australia has a very insane turnover. Everything is so expensive here and cheap overseas so most drugs are highly profitable if you do it right.<br />Meth/MDMA/Ketamine/Amphetamines/Coke seem to be the most profitable here.

				hey Aussiepp, I was wondering, Is it any more sketchy to sell drugs in Australia as opposed to the USA? Like what do you think about Law Enforcement as related to drugs in Australia? Is it just the importing thats the hard part? And then once you get it in the country easy as anywhere else?

LE are a lot less strict here, especially when dealing with amounts that are considered personal supply. For example, &#039;Cannabis cautions&#039; are frequently given out rather than prosecution. <br />Importing is definitely the hard part. We have one of the &#039;best&#039; Customs in the world, with much higher seizure rates than the large majority of countries.<br />Hope that makes sense, I&#039;m tired as hell.

Depends who you know though.<br /><br />Yea buying 2kg of MDMA for $40,000 from Europe and importing it and selling it in grams here would get you $500,000.

				Buying O/S then offloading in Aus most definitely has a good turn around. Lets just say I were to get an Oz of crystal off a well known O/S vender for say....under $3000. Selling in points and the occasional gram here and there I can make $25,000+ quite easily, it is quite the opportunity that fellow citizens whom aren&#039;t following road will never be able to dream of unless they have some pretty important contacts. IRL offers of $10,000 an Oz is the best I&#039;ve stumbled upon. <br />&nbsp;
