				So I was thinking.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want something to smoke hash out of,&nbsp; or oils,&nbsp; or dmt.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen pen type things offered by some sellers, and some pretty mixed reviews on them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any suggestions?&nbsp; I really don&#039;t want to smoke hash off the end of a pin,&nbsp; so until I find something I will have to just throw some crumbs on top of pot in a bowl.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Mucho grassyass,&nbsp; and thank you.

				Crumbs of hash on top of a bowl of weed is better than a sharp stick in the eye.

				Smoking hash in glass is best done by smoking down a bowl until you have a layer of pure gray ash at the bottom of the bowl (sometimes you have to add a bit more to smoke ontop to build the layer of ash). Throw your hash onto the ash screen, and bring the herb iron, lighter, etc.. close but not to the hash. Vape pens fall into differnt categories. Some, are meant for herbs, and can handle hash. The other are for budder, oil, or shatter. If your looking for a concentrate pen, check out the e-skillet. For herb check out the e-blunt (I think that was it&#039;s name). <br /><br />If you want to vaproize out of glass, theres a newer vape called the vape exhalecloud that attaches to glass. <br />To smoke DMT search &#039;The machine DMT&#039; to find the best way to smoke DMT. have fun!

				I have 2 vape pens.&nbsp; So here&#039;s my thoughts.<br /><br />I have an original G Pen and a Cloud Vape (looks like the new mini G Pen)<br /><br />The original G pen kinda sucks because of the way the cartridges are.&nbsp; They are also expensive. <br /><br />I went ahead and bought the Cloud Vape and have been extremely happy.&nbsp; The cartridge lasts about 3 months and only costs me 10 bucks to replace.<br /><br />The coil heats up nice and you get FAT RIPS out of the cloud.<br /><br />They cost about 60-80 USD at my local head shops.<br /><br />I&#039;m a Prop 215 patient so i&#039;m able to walk into dispensaries and get the finest waxes.

I just hate having to inconvenience them going to the post office and what not. I feel like its easier to do it here, but obviously more expensive. I hope SR eventually offers competitively priced concentrates. Maybe in bulky listings of 7g+ at a time.

				I currently use a ThermoVape Revolution for oils/concentrates. I&#039;m still using a MFLB for bud. They have both served me well. Can&#039;t say I would give glowing reviews for either, but they get the job done. I&#039;ve got my eye on the DaVinci Ascent that&#039;s supposed to be coming out pretty soon. Looks pretty bad ass.
