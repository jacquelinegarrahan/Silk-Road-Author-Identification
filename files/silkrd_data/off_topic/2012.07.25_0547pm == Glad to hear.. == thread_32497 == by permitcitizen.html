				Confused by this thread. You&#039;re glad to hear that your DMT isn&#039;t fake? Buy a Marquis Reagent testing kit. Also, DMT has a very specific smell, and is somewhat sticky normally.<br /><br />If you&#039;re that paranoid, you can easily extract DMT from mimosa hostilis. Having a testing kit is always a good idea.

				Oh, I get what he&#039;s saying. He&#039;s glad the DMT isn&#039;t extracted with stupid shit from a hardware store. <br /><br />Don&#039;t know what&#039;s wrong with lye though, it&#039;s just normal NaOH. I think the Acid/Base teks are the best.

				I was actually joking about the description of Utopic&#039;s DMT, &quot;NO POOL CLEANERS!&quot; made me chuckle, I guess I should have been more descriptive and less stoned aha<br /><br />...because you know, that&#039;s the selling point...<br /><br />-_-;

I have used it successfully to teach and question children in classes about stereotypes/human structure so on. When I graduated the kids/teacher noted that my use of sarcasm was really effective and that it would be missed. I have a big poster from them in writing noting that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I`ve thrown that idea before on a another forum, it just doesn`t work. One can only hope that the receiving end can understand and relate to it.&nbsp;
