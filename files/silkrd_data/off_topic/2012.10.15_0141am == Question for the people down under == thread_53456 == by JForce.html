				It&#039;s been on my mind for a while now so thought I&#039;d ask!<br /><br />The Australian domestic vendors seem to be charging huge prices for all drugs apart from weed really.. and I know that this is because of how hard it is to get drugs imported because of customs.. but do you actually expect to pay themselves from a local dealer?<br /><br />

				I&#039;m going to assume that JForce is asking while we as Aussies would pay an Aussie vendor so much money for drugs and take the chance of not receiving or getting busted by LE for trafficking via the mail system when we could get them from a local dealer either for less money or less hassle! <br /><br />JForces local time suggests he is somewhere in north west Africa or at least in that time zone so he probably can&#039;t comprehend the complete shit that local street dealers sell here and call drugs, <br />Basically a gram of coke in a major aus city costs between $300 and $500, said gram on average probably contains around 30% cocaine,<br />I have travelled extensively around the US, Mexico and Europe so I actually know what coke should both cost and taste/feel like, <br />The Aussie vendors on SR maybe expensive compared to OS vendors but generally it&#039;s more convenient and better quality than the street dealers and not expensive to what street dealers pass off as coke.<br /><br />Hope this makes sense and help answer ur question!

				In that case, I think my main factor for using the road is simply in terms of harm reduction, and it also ends up saving me money. An average australian pressed pill has minimal amounts of mdma and the amount of adulterated pills floating around the market is ridiculous. This coupled with the fact that they are normally $30 per bean makes it the very very last option. On the road we can source uncut/unadulterated product, which is two to three times the quality of that on the street, and is roughly $10 cheaper. The majority of consumers simply don&#039;t care what they ingest as long as they get them &quot;fucked&quot;. I on the other hand want to limit neurotoxicity and general damage as much as I can, soo for me there is no price that I can put on my health. You&#039;ve got a better chance of winning the lottery than getting crystal mdma from a local dealer (that isn&#039;t sourced from the private scene) in my area. I literally mean lucky to get any mdma at all, let alone 50% or /60%. It&#039;s really a no brainer, regardless of price.

				If you do a little research on the actual damage mdma does on your bodies serotonin receptors and such you&#039;ll find results vary quite significantly and no solid evidence exists. Md used in moderation (once every four weeks) is significantly less harmful than most think, plus if you take antioxidants before rolling, neurotoxicty again is further reduced as it inhibits oxidation in those receptors (from what i&#039;ve read). I suppose most don&#039;t consume in moderation, and it becomes a weekly occurrence, that&#039;s when issues arise. Too much of anything is no good&nbsp; ;)
