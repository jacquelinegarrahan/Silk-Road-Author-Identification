				Do any of you yayo users have suggestions on what and where to get better tools for frequent use.&nbsp; I&#039;m using a cut plastic straw, plastic bullets which haven&#039;t held up, and still chopping with a razor blade.&nbsp; The straw gets dirty and probably unsanitary.<br /><br />Are the snuff supplies on Amazon for example, suitable for coke?&nbsp; There are bullets, grinders, stainless steel straws, etc. for snuff.&nbsp; Any of you using these?&nbsp; Pardon the stupid question but I just need to upgrade.&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions.<br /><br />BigFlake

I used to do this but realistically the toilets are the only place to snort and some are just fucking filthy! I have gone for the mirror, SS tube and cutter combo, it also comes with a little cup shovel which is really cool for getting it out of a bag. If your in the states just google cocaine tools and there are a heap of online sites to choose from. Wouldnt mind getting a grinder, any opinions on this? <br /><br />Hoffa

				I got a clear plastic tube that seals tightly against your nostril from a head shop, and one of those glass bottles with a spoon attached as well. I do all my preparation at home. <br /><br />I have one of those plastic grinders, but I don&#039;t use it much these days. The mesh screen has stretched and it doesn&#039;t grind that well anymore. Haven&#039;t bothered to get a replacement screen for it, as it was a bit hit and miss anyway: the coke comes out really fine, but if your coke is a bit oily it quickly clogs the screen. I still use the plastic funnel that came with it a lot, it screws onto the bottle and prevents spilling when you fill it up for use.

				If you do an Amazon search for &quot;snuff&quot; in the &quot;Everything Else&quot; department, you&#039;ll find grinders, bullets, metal straws, spoons, and more.&nbsp; I assume this is all suitable for our purposes as well?&nbsp; I kinda feel strange ordering a bunch of this on Amazon.&nbsp; I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s not considered &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; if it could be used for coke, meth, whatever.&nbsp; <br /><br />Has anyone used any snuff equipment for coke?&nbsp; Sorry, but I&#039;m not that familiar with snuff!<br /><br />BF

				I guess I&#039;ll order some &quot;snuff&quot; tools off eBay or Amazon and add some snuff to the order so it appears legit.&nbsp; Although, they wouldn&#039;t be selling the tools if they were illegal...right?&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />BF

I get my nitrous there, etc. Everything they have has legitimate uses, so they can&#039;t get you just for that.
