				I was wonder what everyone&#039;s favorite opioid experiences were.&nbsp; My guess is they were probably one of the first few times at largish doses.&nbsp; One of my favorites was with simple hydrocodone.&nbsp; I got 20 5/500 Vics after wisdom teeth extraction, which I used strictly as prescribed.&nbsp; But when I went for my checkup a few days later to make sure everything had been healing properly, the doc asked me if I needed more, and of course I didn&#039;t decline.&nbsp; Did a cold water extraction and had 50mg.&nbsp; The euphoria was probably the best ever, but I did feel really sick the next morning.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done oxycodone, heroin, and hydromorphone since, and the first few oxy experiences have provided probably the most euphoric/enjoyable times.

				Nice, those have morphine, thebaine, codeine, and some other alkaloids I think.&nbsp; <br /><br />I snorted a 40mg oxy and then an 8mg Dilaudid an hour later tonight.&nbsp; This might be my most pleasurable opioid experience ever, I&#039;m nodding so hard with so much euphoria.&nbsp; No scary side effects unlike heroin (which sometimes caused pretty damn slow breathing), just the usual opioid itch which I almost enjoy because it lets me know that I&#039;m still high.
