				I wish the entire branch of the dea would just be shut down. They contribute absolutely nothing useful to society in anyway.

				It would be very naive for people to think that some law enforcement departments are not monitoring this cite daily. The CIA has been exposed a long time ago with what they did with Ricky Ross and Oliver North. It&#039;s even on YouTube as is a lot of government cover ups and scandals. It&#039;s all about the money guys. They want to control all of the coke and anything else that people will pay for. Marijuana too. Just look at the taxes being paid yearly by just one dispensary in Cali last year. Do you think there really not going to allow marijuana to be legalized? or shall I say DE-criminalized. They could easily block or outlaw the TOR browser in America but that would cut into their tax money. What they should do is quit funding the DEA to eradicate Marijuana. It&#039;s a big waste of tax money(15 billion a year) for a non violent god given plant. But hey that would make some DEA agents a little pissed.

				online criminal activity is probably a cooperation of the secret service and the DEA, and yes its extremely naive to think they aren&#039;t investigating it or even running it, they want to know who kmf, pine, dpr, limitless, 3jane etc are, if not their own paid agents. they are linking anything they can and trying to nail some higher up<br /><br />read up on &quot;operation firewall&quot; and the online shadowcard forums, gives some curious insight into how they track these things even if dated by a few years. the secret service literally hired the operator of the carding forum and paid him to continue to run it, after they finished their jobs, they left him and he went back to his life of crime to end up pulling off some massive card &quot;heists&quot;
