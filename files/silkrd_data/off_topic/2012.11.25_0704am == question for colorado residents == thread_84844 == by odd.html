				Recently as I&#039;ve discussed in other threads I&#039;ve been diagnosed with stage four cancer and given about 12 months to live. Because of this&nbsp; members of my family approached me offering to take me on a vacation to anywhere (within reason) in the united states.&nbsp; I was wondering what it is like now that marijuana has been legalized?&nbsp; Are you finding it easier to access marijuana?&nbsp; How&#039;s the quality?&nbsp; Has this even been implemented yet?&nbsp; I struggle with staying comfortable and getting ahead on my medicinal marijuana stash due to the fact that i have a very limited amount i can spend each week on meds and thought a nice vacation in Colorado with safe, easy, (cheap!) access to meds and the chance to scale some of your beautiful mountains would be a great vacation for me.&nbsp; Looking forward to hearing how if anything has changed

				Wow man terribly sorry to hear that, coincidentally somewhat similar to the end of Bob Marley&#039;s life, check out the documentary on him called Marley by Kevin MacDonald. <br /><br />Anyway, weed is definitely abundant in colorado, it doesn&#039;t take quite a lot of talking to be able to get your hands on some. If you have legit cancer, there are several dispensaries that will pay for your doctor visit to get your medical card if you become their member. The weed is bomb, most of it is grown indoors so you can only expect top quality. <br /><br />Colorado is a great choice friend, wish you the best!

				No need to be sorry friend.&nbsp; It comes with some positives too.&nbsp; The ability to truely live each day to the fullest, my life currently is filled with loved ones, family, and friends, free vacations LOL.&nbsp; But in all seriousness thank you for your condolences.&nbsp; I try to keep it in my head there&#039;s a bigger purpose in all of it.&nbsp; And thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Colorado sounds lovely :)&nbsp; do you know if you have to be a resident of Colorado to get a medical card?
