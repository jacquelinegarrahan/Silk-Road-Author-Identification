				Come on! No one here plays video games?<br /><br />What do you guys think about Microsoft new Xbox one and how you have to be online at least every 24hrs for it to check in and them making you pay a fee if you want to give away your game(well whoever you give it to pays a fee)or how the connect is mandatory and records and checks how many people are in the room.<br /><br />Sony announced that they will support used games and will not require you to be online at all for single player games but it looks like they will go the way of Microsoft and make ya pay to play online games.<br /><br />I mostly watch E3 for the games and exclusives i really can not wait for Sept. and GTA5 anyway someone has to have an opinion let me know fellow gamers!!

				Ive got a PS3 at the moment, will probably go with a PS4 in the near future. From what I&#039;ve read/heard, the PS4 will be far superior to the xbox one..

				I have an xbox 360 and I will be switching back to playstation when the 4 comes out. I feel like xbox fucked up bad. Yeah it will be a cool entertainment system, but I have google TV that does almost everything that xbox one will do and it only cost me like $100. Plus Bungie is now only for playstation. I&#039;m praying Destiny&#039;s multiplayer will be half as good as halo 3. I will be very happy if that happens. Hardest part will be learning those uncomfortable playstation controllers. Hopefully someone will make an xbox controller that works with the ps4 very soon after it comes out. I love the xbox controllers so much more. I&#039;m not a big gamer, just enjoy playing a little video games from time to time. <br /><br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				It really amuses me to see how Microsoft is falling apart.<br />First with the Windows Phone then with Windows 8 and now last but not least a double fail (first fail when they presented the Xbox One in May).<br />Who the fuck wants a console in his / her living room which has the capabilities of being used to spy on one? I don&#039;t<br /><br />Damn, I can&#039;t wait for Marcus Beer&#039;s (Annoyed Gamer) E3 2013 conclusion, I&#039;ll certainly piss myself.

				i have always been a playstation guy, ever since the ps1, i never even owned an xbox untill after my second ps3 broke i figured i would give it a go. Just to see the difference. It wasn&#039;t so bad, but i still preffered the ps, it felt more gamer dynamic. <br /><br />And now with the new results, the fact that the xbox one , you have to pay to play pre owned or borrowed games, you have to have it online at least once a day or some bullshit and loads of other crap i cant remember, it just seems like the xbox is a load of complete shit now. <br />The ps4 is all about gaming, The xbox is all about making cash and entertainment, netflix and other crap. <br /><br />on top of it all the ps is a lot cheaper. Who the hell in their right mind would buy an xbox one? <br /><br />

				Xbox one for sure. Its better than the ps4 in my opinion, it will have live cable, netflix and all that other jazz. PS4 is definitely more of a gamer machine but as i get older i&#039;m leaning towards the xbox because it is an all around media machine. Especially now that it supports blu-ray i have no use for a playstation.

				PS4 100% not only is it cheaper more powerful tech wise &amp; just the fact you can still sell off a game once you&#039;ve finished them is a huge bonus, can&#039;t believe you have to verify discs on the xbox one while online LOL!!!!<br /><br />Also that new ps4 exclusive game Destiny looks amazing.. oh and driveclub looks like a blast
