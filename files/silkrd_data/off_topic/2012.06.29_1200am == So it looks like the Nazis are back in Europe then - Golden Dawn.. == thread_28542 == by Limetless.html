				Anyone seen these pig-fucks in action? One of their MPs battered a female MP from the opposing socialist party recently and then went on the run. They are basically as close to the Nazis as you can get and have been clearing out immigrant areas and basically using terror-squad tactics like the SA did. They even paint the S rune the SS used on places they consider their territory or have strong political influence.<br /><br />A sad day in Europe indeed, especially as it&#039;s coming from a country that was raped so badly by the Nazis and the Fascist Italians during WW2, how short peoples memories are!<br />&nbsp;

				That sucks. We have those fuckers over here, too, and their marches and demonstrations are protected by free speech. Fortunately, they are usually outnumbered at their demonstrations by sane people who actually know their history.

Pisses me off that they use their economic bullshit as an excuse to pick on the dark people and the only reason they feel the need to do that is probably because their fathers never told them they loved them as a child. If you look at most people with ultra-political stances on things you see that they had issues in their childhood and then they use the political party as a substitute for the family environment they never had. <br /><br />The Golden Dawn are a quite heavy though, they make the BNP (the English Nazis) look pretty friendly.

What do you do get a prayer and spread it on some toast and eat it with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ? You Americans have some weird shit I tell ya. If you said the phrase &quot;Prayer Breakfast&quot; in the U.K people would probably think you were a some sort of cultist. In fact I&#039;m fairly confident that if you said &quot;Prayer Breakfast&quot; in my local pub everyone would stop drinking, go silent and look at you and after about 5 seconds of awkward silence the landlord what say something like &quot;We don&#039;t like that kind of things round here so get out you slaaaaaag&quot;. <br /><br />Yeah I thought like 75% of American republicans favourite catchphrase was &quot;They took ur jurbs&quot; &lt; South Park accent

I think I would have split down the middle laughing. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Aw hell, by the time I heard that story I was already so disillusioned with those people it was just another reason to hate the fucking job. In my position I had access to all the financials, and knew they were nothing but two faced, theiving whores. They not only stole from their suppliers, they stole from the employees, too, and not in a clever way. It was all over the news by the time the whole fiasco was said and done. But they were &quot;saved&quot; which means they can do no wrong because they have already been &quot;forgiven&quot; so anything can be justified to get that Mercedes in the sky. Evidently their version of the American dream was to lie, cheat and steal then pray for forgiveness at breakfast. <br /><br />This is awesome--had one conversation with him when our local city council was up for election. He told me his &quot;group&quot; was going to be &quot;choosing&quot; the winning candidate, and he was quite proud of that. By &quot;choosing&quot; he meant they picked the people their little God-club wanted in office, then funded them to the hilt to make sure they won, while meeting for breakfast weekly to pray their dudes into office. Only problem is, this is a very progressive town and the voters see through that kind of shit quite easily. All of the God-clubs candidates were soundly thumped at the polls. So many times I wanted to trow that shit in his face, but he was so oblivious and blinded by bible passages that he wouldn&#039;t have got it. When those hard-core dudes get struck down they write it off to &quot;God has another plan for me&quot; and move on to the next rip-off scam.
