				put them into small jiffy pots and its been a week and they are about 5 in. tall. Ive had them under fluoresent lights and my question is when should I transplant them to larger pots. I dont want to stunt their root growth. I want to get them outside as soon as possible. What do you guys think?

				Wont matter what plant, do it as soon as a root pokes through the jiffy pellet. Or if its a jiffy pot wait at least a couple of weeks for them to build up a stronger root system, transplanting can do more bad then good if not done carefully. GL&nbsp;

				If the roots are coming out of the bottom, you&#039;d best be repotting soon or you could get root rot.<br />I would just take the jiffys and bury then 2/3 into a larger pot, like around the size of a 2L soda bottle.<br />Also, put a fan on them to strengthen the stem for outdoors, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re planning.

				5in sounds a bit tall for a week old plant. Make sure they are getting enough light and that the lights are as close as possible without touching the plant. You might want to add more lights to increase the intensity. Also, a good tip for using fluorescents in to mix the yellow and white lights to make sure you plants recieve the full spectrum of light they need.<br /><br />Happy growing!
