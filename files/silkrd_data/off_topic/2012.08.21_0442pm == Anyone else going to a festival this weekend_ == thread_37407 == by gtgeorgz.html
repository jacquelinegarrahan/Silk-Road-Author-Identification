				Not me personally, but my supervisor went to the V festival here in the uk.<br />ITs like the second best thing to Reading festival.<br />He said it was fucking awesome, although the combination of being the hottest day of the year, alcohol and drugs in the end made him sick as a dog.<br />Other than that it was great lol.

				I&#039;m going to a mainstream one that&#039;s in a major city, so it&#039;s not an all-weekend camp kinda thing.<br /><br />But i&#039;m going to another festival for about 4 days in Minnesota here in about 2 weeks, which I&#039;m pumped about cus I&#039;ve been working a lot to support my love for K, hash and music, so i could use a break.

				Sounds like a plan but really, 100 pills??&nbsp; fuck that, it would be better take four or five REALLY good pills that can go the distance.<br />Besides at festivals not only are you going mix different drugs, there is the drink involved.<br />Do you really want to risk taking 100 pills to a festival??.

				Anyone tried 25c at festivals? Was going to tell selling some of HH&#039;s tabs at a festival. Probably £4 each, and definitely not going to advertise it as acid because I&#039;m not an arsehole :)

Dick move. Usually I bring my own stuff to festies. This summer though I was out and I bought a couple tabs off some guy at a fest and turned out to be 25x-NBOMe which one, I&#039;m not sure. It was awful though. I don&#039;t really like RC trips and was already on a drop of L so it sent me into a bad spot and ruined my whole weekend. Fuck false advertisement.

Went to a festival only to&nbsp; be greeted by a full on bag search at random, around 20 people at a time as well as 2 dogs. I highly doubt these are trained dogs however since they would surely have a heart attack when presented with the amount of drugs coming through the front gate. Anyway managed to squeeze through avoiding the searches only to be greeted by the dog. I just had to fucking peg it, with my 30g of md :) One way to get the heart racing for sure. <br /><br />Then once in the festival security were being far more alert than I have ever seen. Saw them kicking the shit out of one guy who was dealing, because he refused to cooperate. Was not a pretty sight. Of course if you are sensible about things 90% of the time you will be fine.

				Well it is summer time mate.<br />Festivals amassed both in the uk and state-side.<br /><br />Personally though, i am 32 years of age and still not taken the advantage of going on a festival.&nbsp; I always thought my mates were wasting their time, but hey now i really regret not ever going.
