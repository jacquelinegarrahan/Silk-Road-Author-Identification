				I&#039;ve been scoping out Dabbing rigs for about a month. Just wondering what you all are using&nbsp; domes? plates? TI nails? quartz? Which torch did you buy/like? etc. <br /><br />how big is your rig, I hear the smaller the better for dabbing (makes sense, I guess) <br /><br />I can&#039;t make up my mind. :/ <br /><br />

				I have a rasta bubbler type rig with a glass dome and nail. I like it but the dome is blowed glass with color so it is hard to see in at what you are doing... I would recommend a titanium nail!<br /><br />Mine is very small and even handheld, I love it. Dabbing takes practice though, but once you get it down your good to go!<br /><br />Also on the torch comment, walmart has a pretty good torch! It&#039;s the more expensive one I believe and I think it comes with a free refill... Hardware Section...<br /><br />Make sure to get a few refills because you run out hella fast...

				I have a ROOR rig with a glass dome and Ti nail. It&#039;s a 45 cm. Not too big, not too small. Works perfectly for me. I would recommend a dome for a dab beginner. (Don&#039;t know if you&#039;re actually a beginning dabber or just buying your first rig.) Ti nails are the way to go in my opinion, although some people say they taste too &quot;metaly.&quot;&nbsp; Personally I&#039;ve never really thought so at all but I guess that can be a matter of preference. And like WO said, you can find good torches at a lot of places. I got a Bernzomatic at Home Depot. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting a decent quality one. Mine was about $40 or so if I recall.

				I got a small 8&quot; scientific glass looking rig.&nbsp; Very easy to clean.&nbsp; Has an oil dome and a glass screen hash pipe attachment.&nbsp; I picked the honeycomb diffuser over the rod diffusers cause it hits like a wide open bong instead of having a pull and getting clogged.&nbsp; Just broke my glass nail.&nbsp; Thinking of trying titanium myself.&nbsp; Looks like this.<br /><br />http://www.igniteme.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0298.jpg

When I can get a 1/2 O for 150-200 to a O for 250-300. <br /><br />how long does a gram last for that kind of money? or is dabbing more of a starter then you just smoke flowers?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Concentrates are cool. They sure do get your fried pretty quick.<br />There&#039;s a reason they&#039;re so expensive, though.<br /><br />My first rig was one I got off SR from Chronic Crew back in the day. <br />Now I have a 14mm TI adjustable nail and a nice rig with a 6 arm perc, that I picked up locally.<br /><br />I can have a gram of wax last me about a week or so, but once you start smoking concentrates on the regular it will take at least an 8th of some heady bud just to get your buzzed.<br />Moderation is key.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m not a super heavy smoker either, so you think 2g would last me a couple weeks. I&#039;m more of a weekend smoker.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you&#039;re only dabbing it up on the weekends, for the most part, then I would say 2g would last you a while.<br />Especially if you are pretty new to concentrates.<br /><br />When I have the wax, I take anywhere from 3-5 dabs on an average week day. <br />I am a pretty heavy smoker though.<br />Granted, I&#039;m basically stoned 24/7. Haha. <br /><br />Ever since I started smoking wax, I&#039;ve found myself needing a lot more bud to get high than normal.<br />I took a break from it a while back and it helped with my tolerance greatly.<br />Might be time for another one..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A complete newb to concentrates. So, I&#039;ll take advise anyone can toss my way..

				Ive been making and smoking honey oil since &#039;02 and always just use homemade portable hot knife tip.<br /><br />1lb propane tank - any hardware store or walmart $5<br />pencil flame tip for soldering - $10-15<br />kitchen knife - heat center of knife til red hot bend it until pointing nearly straight down<br />big safety pin - stretch out and curve the sharp pointy tip slightly<br />empty bic pen (melt the air hole closed)<br /><br />The tip of knife will easily hang off tip of torch which will keep it red hot. tank lasts 45-50 hours.<br /><br />1g oil is approx 150-200 hoots. True budder is best concentrate (REAL budder not the crap &quot;budderman&quot; sells lol). 1g budder will get a noob FRIED bout 45-50 times.

So far so good.&nbsp; I heat cycled the Quartz nail I got 4-5 times, but my first dab tasted kind of metallic-ish. Will that go away?

				Hey guys, not to thread jack but I also had a few questions. <br /><br />I had a small nail &amp; dome bubbler that just broke &amp; I was going to snag another.<br /><br />I was going to go for the nail again I think but go titanium this time instead.<br /><br />Anyone recommend any brands in particular?<br /><br />How nice to perc&#039;s make the whole process?
