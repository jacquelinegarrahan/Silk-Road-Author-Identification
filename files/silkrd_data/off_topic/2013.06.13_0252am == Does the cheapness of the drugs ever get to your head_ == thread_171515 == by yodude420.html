				I started getting molly off here and selling it locally.&nbsp; Before this i had tried molly before and didnt have any desire to do it regularly, but when i started getting alot of it and making a killing my use went way up.&nbsp; I went through a 4 month period where i ate it between 2 and 4 times a week.&nbsp; When i would dose i got to the point where i needed .2 (im about 145lbs) and i always redosed 2 or 3 times.&nbsp; For a while i had a job but when i lost that i kept getting fucked up same as normal, oh and i should mention when i roll its nothing for me and 1 or 2 friend to smoke a quarter(usually more) of dank that night.&nbsp; So here i am couple months later no money in my pocket, not sure how to pay rent, and barely enough drugs commin in-FUCK!&nbsp; Im gonna turn it around its just gonna take some time, anyways im an idiot blah blah i hope some other people post some good shit make me feel less stupid.

				Yes, one of the qualities of being a good drug dealer is having great self control. It&#039;s important, so I suggest you develop it.

				There will be a point in time when you put the little light gloves down and you will be at a festival not rolling and you will be selling and making money and seeing everyones faces and you will feel above them and keep making money and then you will simply stop rolling and put yourself in a buisness mans position instead of a roller plur kid that eats molly like its candy.

				Yes, but the opposite as you.<br /><br /><br />I haven&#039;t had nearly the urge to try roll as I did when it was 20/pill of probably M1 from some sketchy dude at a party, or from a pretty girl in a thong and tutu. I rolled every opportunity I found back then... But until an event seeks me out, I&#039;m unlikely to roll for another few months. No more desire, and so many more tasks to handle.<br /><br />If addy was cheap on here, I&#039;d probably be hooked on the stuff though.
