				When I started using DMT I had insanely fast-paced breakthroughs where I would be shown a new picture every quarter of a second in my mind. I had a couple of extremely fun breakthroughs too where I swear to god I was smiling and howling with laughter the whole time after smoking 70+mg. But lately my trips have been getting really strange, it could be because im smoking it so often, but the last trip was the most fucked up.<br /><br />I broke through on about 60mg and my eyes instantly shut but the entire room in front of me was still completely visible. Everything started changing colors (like it usually does), but then a woman appeared beside me and she looked like she was talking but wasnt producing any sound. Then hes the fucked up part, three figures (which looked like men in those full-body morph suits) appeared on the table in front of me. One was green, the other was red, and another was blue. They just started randomly having seizures on the table and I kept thinking how fucking weird it was while it was happening. Meanwhile the whole god damn room is moving and changing colors and this girl beside me is still talking to me without making a sound.<br /><br />Had another experience last night that was kinda similar. It could be the dmt im smoking cause its new, but lately my trips have gotten fucking weird.<br /><br />Anyone else had some weird trips on different dmt then you&#039;re used to?

				Ive smoked DMT in a ton of ways. There aren&#039;t really any special ways to do it.<br /><br />1. Smoke it in a pipe on some weed or ash, keep the lighter flame off the dmt and let it melt into the ash, then smoke the whole thing normally<br />2. use the &quot;DMT&quot; machine, works great apparently. Ive never used it<br />3. Vaporizer (Ive only done this twice cause its slow and hard to break through but it works)<br />4. Meth/oil pipes work great too

				Just use a normal pipe, don&#039;t melt under it unless you have an oil pipe.<br /><br />I have a fairly good sized gandalf-pipe. I pack about 0.1 of weed and put the DMT on top. I use a butane lighter and keep the lighter flame about half a centimeter away from the DMT. After a while it starts to melt into the herb and then you can just smoke the whole thing normally.<br /><br />The first time I did DMT I put some freebase into a pipe, lit the entire thing, and had an amazing trip even though I clearly burned it. I think smoking it in that way just results in a small loss of product, you still get the effects for sure.

				Everyone has to start somewhere, I don&#039;t think making and using a DMT-machine is very practical for a first time DMT smoker if they don&#039;t even know what they are doing. Ive never used one before, 90% of the time I smoke it I just use an oil pipe or gandalf pipe and rarely a vaporizer. The pipes work fantastic if you know what you are doing :p<br /><br />Ive had breakthroughs on 40mg by smoking DMT through a pipe, there clearly isn&#039;t a large amount of lost product.
