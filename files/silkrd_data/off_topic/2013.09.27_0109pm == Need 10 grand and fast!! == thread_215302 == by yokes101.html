				Ok one of my mates has a bit of a problem to say the least.<br />He is a big dealer and cut a long story short the cops got a hold of all of his product which was not paid for yet.<br /><br />Now he doesn&#039;t have the money to pay off the bill and nothing to sell to make more cash.<br />The dealer is going crazy and gotten some very dangers people involved.<br /><br />If he could get a few grand together every week or so I think they will back off.<br /><br />But with no money to invest and no product at hand I have no idea where the moneys going to come from.<br /><br />I know this have probably been asked on the forums a million times but what would you do in his shoes?

				I need 10 grand fast too, otherwise I won&#039;t have 10 grand. Probably will spend it on wine and women and then I&#039;ll waste the rest on something stupid like University.
