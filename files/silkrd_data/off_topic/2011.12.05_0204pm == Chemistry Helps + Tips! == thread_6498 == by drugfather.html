				Yeah, I like I said, I&#039;m definitely not going to be getting anything through theft, and I&#039;m getting to old to get the school kids to swipe for me.&nbsp; I do have some college buddies, but I don&#039;t know what the science programs are like at the small university near me. I guess I was thinking more specific things like sep-funnels, condensers, vacuum setups, and adapters with multiple inputs or outputs for drips and vacuum.&nbsp; (I saw the listings here on the road, and such an investment is appropriate for me as I&#039;m not even sure I&#039;d follow through with anything.)&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;ll pick-up one of those toy-store/hobby kits just to play around with the basics.<br /><br />Also, info on household precursors for various chemicals needed for distillation and reduction processes and how to refine them.&nbsp; I&#039;m getting kind of specific here, and I&#039;ve still got a lot of reading to do on my own before diving in.&nbsp; I am however thinking about going back for some further education in a completely unrelated field,&nbsp; but perhaps I could fill out my curriculum with some basic 101 stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m by no means attempting to dive into this stuff head first, but it does interest me and I believe I have the aptitude for it.&nbsp; Also, I&#039;ve found myself in a location that is suitable for some home experimentation.&nbsp; Anyway, I appreciate the thread, and perhaps in the not-so-distant future, I would be interested in some more personal lessons through our unique anonymous interface here on the Road.

				I really wasnt offended at all just more curious, and definitely wanted you to correct me if I had the wrong idea about something since I am always trying to further my understanding. I wanted to change my posts too so others didnt interpret anything incorrectly as well. I completely agree with you about people without background knowledge and experience making claims and suggesting things, however I hope I do not do that. I mainly just try to answer peoples questions, especially for harm reduction, to the best of my ability. You are probably right that I do not choose exactly the precise terms which is important (especially since I am baked most of the time while on here&nbsp; :P), but I assumed I had made a gross error since you said I was wrong. Sadly I may have actually made an actual error and recommended GummyStars for his god service when it turns out he seems to be another scam unfortunately. Now that was wrong I am beginning to think.<br /><br />In regards to MDMA, I have noticed you have posted that it was not neurotoxic, and while I am not saying it will fry the serotonergic fibers with moderate isolated use, I would still say that it is certainly stressful on these neurons and there is still a significant amount of research referencing the neurotoxicity of MDMA. I would agree alcohol is damaging as well, but possibly we just have different ideas of the term &quot;neurotoxicity.&quot; You can probably see why there could easily be an entire thread dedicated to the matter. <br /><br />Thanks for your response,<br />- microRNA
