				Hi all,<br /><br />Perhaps this is old news, but I just noticed that the btc services temporarily halted have been restored, albeit with a new policy on identity disclosure.

				Yeah, that&#039;s harsh.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it still somewhat safe though? Goes to Coinapult, and from there you can just toss it through a few wallets or straight to your SR wallet if you&#039;re not concerned.

				The new policies are a bit frustrating, but buying Bitcoins is certainly not illegal and if you move them around a few times after purchasing under your own identity I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned.&nbsp; I also change my SR BTC address every time I add funds so as not to establish a pattern to the same account.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, I made a cash deposit earlier this morning (after having a lot of trouble just connecting to BitInstant.com) and 2 hours later it has not shown up in MTGox.&nbsp; This usually takes about 5 minutes so I called BitInstant and they told me they were the victims of a DDOS attack and that everything is moving quite slow right now.&nbsp; Crossing my fingers that the funds show up sometime today, or at least that I haven&#039;t lost my money.

				Yeah, can&#039;t seem to access their website. I&#039;m sure your situation will be sorted TheDude, but for others I&#039;d just wait it out and make sure the DDoS attack is done before trying to buy btc from BitInstant.

				good to hear!<br /><br />i&#039;m not so sure about the identity disclosure but will read into it<br /><br />I just went through a PITA to get bitcoins this past weekend with bitinstant.&nbsp; I will say this their support helped me out.

				Everything did work out ok, just a bit delayed.&nbsp; The uncertainty isn&#039;t a great feeling, I agree with those who advocate holding off until we know all BitInstant DDOS issues have been resolved.

				Since bit instant went down I tried out Blue Sky Traders and been getting my coins in an hour or less and the fees are the same if not lower then bit instant. It is good to switch up from time to time anyway so I&#039;ll stick with BST for the time being. It sounds a little sketch what bit instant is doing now anyway. Bank deposits with BST requires no proof of id. If ask it is easy to use a fake name and address and fake number if needed. Blue Sky Traders has 100% positive feedback&nbsp; ;)
