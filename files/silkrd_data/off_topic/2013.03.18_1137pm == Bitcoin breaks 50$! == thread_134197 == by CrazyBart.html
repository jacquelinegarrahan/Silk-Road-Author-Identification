				It is good news ... It kinda crashed last week after the big surge, then the blockchain forked .. but it still goes on.<br /><br />Mainstream media is reporting on it, I see stores on the Island here accepting it more and more as payment ... Silk Road is just a small piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />$100 by the end of summer I think.

				I&#039;ve heard people referring to Blockchain.info failing. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been using it as one of my wallets. Should I be especially worried. (I&#039;m always worried).

				When I attempted to use them a few days ago on the 16th and 17th there was a lot of errors on Blockchain.info but yesterday it started working for me again. It may take time before everyone&#039;s wallets are fixed on there but don&#039;t quote me on that, that&#039;s only speculation.

				It&#039;s now worth more technically to rob someone for their bit coins rather than their cash. . . Freaky world we live in now.&nbsp; This is a stickup.&nbsp; Gimme all your bit coins onto this USB stick now!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I read somewhere that the amount of BTC generated every year drops, i my opinion, The group of people that came up with that idea, have hundreds of thousands if not millions tucked away untill there is only so many thousand generated a year and the price goes sky high. Im telling you They are sitting there laughing right now the fact that BTC is now displayed on stock boards the world over and recognized as an official digital currency if it&#039;s true. Think what they were worth originally when they were first started practically nothing, Now $50, I reckon it&#039;s money making time for a select few who have pulled off one of best investment ideas ever.
