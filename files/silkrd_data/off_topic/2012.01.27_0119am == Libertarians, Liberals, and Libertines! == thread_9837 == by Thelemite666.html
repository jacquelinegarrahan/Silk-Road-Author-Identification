				I have never bought from this marketplace, but I signed up to say that I fully support and believe in what is going on here.<br /><br />I wanted to post/share something. Something that some people on this forum may or may not have seen before. I think that at this time, and with places like this coming up on the web, people may be more readily able to apprehend the wisdom contained in the following.<br /><br />Ladies and Gents of the SR forum, I present to you Liber Oz:<br /><br />Liber LXXVII<br /><br />&quot;the law of<br />the strong:<br />this is our law<br />and the joy<br />of the world.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; —AL. II. 21<br /><br />&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; —AL. I. 40<br /><br />&quot;thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.&quot; —AL. I. 42–3<br /><br />&quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot; —AL. I. 3<br />There is no god but man.<br /><br />1. Man has the right to live by his own law—<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to live in the way that he wills to do:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to work as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to play as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to rest as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to die when and how he will. <br />2. Man has the right to eat what he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to drink what he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to dwell where he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to move as he will on the face of the earth. <br />3. Man has the right to think what he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to speak what he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to write what he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build as he will:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; to dress as he will. <br />4. Man has the right to love as he will:—<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;take your fill and will of love as ye will,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; when, where, and with whom ye will.&quot; —AL. I. 51 <br />5. Man has the right to kill those who would thwart these rights.<br /><br />&quot;the slaves shall serve.&quot; —AL. II. 58<br /><br />&quot;Love is the law, love under will.&quot; —AL. I. 57<br /><br /><br /><br />Although personally, I would have changed &quot;man&quot; to &quot;mankind&quot; and changed every instance of &quot;him&quot; to a less gender implicit pronoun.<br /><br />This was written by Aleister Crowley near the end of his life. Though he was often called the &quot;wickedest man&quot;, and a black magician, I think plenty of people here would be surprised to learn he was not much different then most of us here.... Forget what you&#039;ve read or been told about AC. It&#039;s all lies! (i.e. that he commited murder, and was a racist women hater.)<br /><br />Each person needs to read his words for themselves and decide... The above should be a fine example. I have plenty more if any one wants too, and I would be happy to elucidate on any the best that I can.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to open the discussion up to his words and philosophies, if any one is interested. I have studied his life and works extensively, and would be interested to talk to any others here who are on the same page.

				At first glance, I would agree too.<br /><br />And you can bet we&#039;re not talking about killing your next door neighbor because he took your paper, and it&#039;s infringing on your over all will in life.

				#5. i will have to say i agree.&nbsp; taken from my favorite book &quot;Endgame Vol. 1&quot; by Derrick Jensen pg. 298:<br /><br />I have a friend, a former prisoner, who is very smart, and who says that dogmatic pacifists are the most selfish people he knows, because they place their moral purity-or to be more precise, their self conception on moral purity- above stopping injustice.

No, I&#039;m much more interested in discussing a man whose life was devoted to propagating and spreading much of the same ideology that I see many people here find fashionable right now.<br /><br />Had no one here seriously read up on the mans philosophies? He practically pioneered the modern state of mind, and did much to influence the people who subesuquelty changed the status quo throughout the close of the last century.<br /><br />That no one here would even be remotely interested in discussing him is disheartening, but whatever...
