				Way to man up and own what ever the fuck it was that you think or they think you did. Much peace and healing to ya, Vanquish. I am unaware of any fuckery perpetrated on innocents by you, but then again, I don&#039;t really associate with any other users of the Road, and I am very careful with who I have chosen as a vendor.<br /><br />I understand completely what having a compromised immune system can do to one&#039;s cognitive processes. I am in the perpetual frankenboot for a break in my right foot that won&#039;t heal. <br /><br />As far as I am concerned, you have done me no wrongs, no apologies necessary in my direction, and may you find that peace and serenity that is obviously needed in your deepest heart of hearts. <br /><br />If you are indeed in need of forgiveness, start with yourself. You have taken ownership of your fuckery, now its time to heal. <br /><br />Blessings on your journey, and should you take a turn for the worse, and shuffle off this mortal coil, be at peace when you go, knowing you have done all you could, and relax into that good night.

				I plan on staying clean until my health improves, and my weight hits 145+ pounds.<br />Doctors are saying that I need to consume 5000 calories per day to have any chance at gaining weight.<br />So essentially I&#039;m on the Michael Phelps diet.<br />I even ordered the 2013 Arizer Extreme Q 4.0 Vaporizer, and once I get out of the hospital - my plan is to medicate with only pot and pretty much eat as healthy as possible.<br />*clearnet warning*<br />http://www.ebay.com/itm/2012-ARIZER-EXTREME-Q-4-0-DIGITAL-VAPORIZER-EXTRAS-FULL-WARRANTY-/300704620599?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4603646037<br /><br />Thanks for the well wishes everyone.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming the negative karma is from Hallucinating Horse and his minions.<br />Vanquish

				Hello Vanquish :)&nbsp; Pretty sure I&#039;ve seen you around here and there, but unfortunately I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve ever met.&nbsp; I read your post and while I have no idea what you&#039;re apologizing for (then again, it seemed to be directed at vendors and I&#039;m not one so...), your OP just about broke my heart :&#039;(&nbsp; &nbsp;While I&#039;ve obviously no knowledge of your medical issues, nor are they any or my business and I&#039;m no doctor.....&nbsp; still, I firmly believe that the main cause of most physical and mental problems is stress.&nbsp; That&#039;s something I&#039;m sure everyone deals with..&nbsp; I know I can&#039;t remember a time when I haven&#039;t been carrying it around at varying levels... it&#039;s so very heavy to carry around though.<br /><br />Just want to say that I truly do hope that you are getting the rest, nutrition and everything else you need to get better.&nbsp; You seem like a very kind and caring person.<br /><br />All the best to you :)

You are a compulsive liar, and you love attention. <br /><br />For gods sake people, the man wrote out a detailed post about handling his own shit and pulling whole chunks of dried mushrooms from it.

				This thread summed up is pretty much,<br /><br />&nbsp;Vanquish, &quot;Sorry shaggy for caring about people. Sorry I got sick from your deadly mushrooms and only wanted to save the lives of innocents. Now for the real hero of this story. I have&nbsp; looked death in the face no less than 34 times. I have have seen jesus so many times but been pulled back, that we are on a first name basis. I have fought against the dark and won, but my admirers, I face a opponent I fear I&nbsp; might fall to....<br /><br />Yesterday at 12:34pm I ingest a burger king double whopper. At 12:40 I started to pour toxic feces from my ass. Right now I am in the ICU and they are administering a very powerful dosage of Bismuth subsalicylate. I&#039;m not sure how much I can take.&nbsp; Bismuth subsalicylate is known to be highly toxic to horses even in small dosages.<br /><br />Only your likes and pitiful comments could save me, so please, pour it on me.&quot;<br /><br />Seriously, admit the truth that you tripped balls and made all this bullshit up, and I will leave you alone.

I just want to remind you that shrooms and LSD cause anxiety and paranoia as they come out of your system. And our minds are so powerful that we can manifest physical symptoms without realizing it and I wonder if to a degree you&#039;ve been going through that. The other day I smoked some opium and then started worrying i&#039;d done too much, then promptly had some sort of weird panic attack and my heart started really beating fast. Luckily I realized what was going on and talked myself down and started enjoying it. <br /><br />I grew up in an area where shrooms grew naturally and every mushroom season we&#039;d be tripping our tits off for weeks. Suddenly, in the weeks and months after the world seemed different and we all became anxious and paranoid and depressed.<br /><br />You talked about worrying the other day LE were coming and burying everything in the woods in the dark. That smacks of paranoia. <br /><br />And other things you&#039;ve mentioned seem to me as if you need to do exactly what your doctors say and lay off the drugs for a while, eat healthy, sleep lots, drink lots of water and exercise. You can do just ten minutes a day to start with and build it up gradually but the endorphins will help the depression and anxiety. Take omega 3 capsules and berroca multi-vitamins daily. <br /><br />And, dude - take some time off Silk Road and the forums for your own sanity. I mean.....come on... posting from your hospital bed in the ICU?<br /><br />The crying and all that are a sign not that you are going to die, but that you are going to LIVE. <br /><br />You&#039;re in the driving seat now, time to be good to yourself. Do it an hour at a time, then a day at a time. Before long you&#039;ll feel better mentally and physically and then and ONLY then should you come back to Silk Road. <br /><br />You can&#039;t be doing trips and messing around with other drugs when you have underlying depression- that&#039;s like putting out a fire with gasoline. <br /><br />My feeling is it&#039;s making your underlying depression much worse and adding paranoia into the mix, not better and it&#039;s time to check yourself.<br /><br />Worry about your health and sanity first, then something you wrote in an online message board forum about a mushroom sample last. <br /><br />You won&#039;t be outcast from the community, but that shouldn&#039;t be your concern. Getting healthy (holistically, both mind and body) is what matters most right now. <br /><br />Everything happens for a reason and you&#039;ve had a nasty scare. You should see that as a LUCKY thing, some people don&#039;t get the wake up call you so obviously need and end up dead and that&#039;s it. Well the good news is you didn&#039;t die and now you have a chance to live, and you can live well if only you&#039;d set aside the paranoia and anxiety.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />TL;DR: You&#039;re being paranoid, time to look after your mental and physical health, look after yourself and take some time off Silk Road forums and marketplace. <br />

				Very mature of you vanquish, stick around, the best is yet to be.<br /><br />It is essential for you to detox.&nbsp; Mushrooms can be very forceful with the lessons they have to teach you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Go at least 2+ weeks without ANYTHING, except tea, not even weed.&nbsp; Wake up and go for a jog every morning.

				Last time I was in ICU they definitely don&#039;t allow you to have a cell phone. All kinds of signs around saying no cell phones since they worry it might interfere with the (rather important) equipment.<br /><br />Nor could you post a typo-free 5000 word response on SR forums from orbot. Bullshit all around. Can we just let this silly thread die?

				Hey Vanq.<br /><br />Though brief, I&#039;ve enjoyed our conversations and your contributions to the community. You are a genuinely good person. I am with you in spirit in the struggle all the way, and I&#039;m sure you&#039;re with me as well. <br /><br />Remember, brother, you control the trip. As you wish. Sure, it sounds silly when we are walking through the fire and our emotions seem to take over sometimes....but...if there was ever a time for us to use the lessons these wonderful substances have taught us, it&#039;s right NOW.<br /><br />I wish you all of the strength to endure and overcome, and emerge from the flames cleansed. I have been close to dying more times than I care to admit, in more than one way, and....it&#039;s made me who I am. Have no fear, friend. <br /><br />AV

				Hey All,<br /><br />I just want to update everyone about everything and clarify everything I possibly can.<br />As many things have been said or posted completely out of context, because of my psychosis and the state of my mind in this difficult time.<br />I rapidly started getting worse, and they admitted me to the Advanced Care Unit of the ICU Ward.<br />This is the part of the hospital that runs Pre/Post diagnostics and interventions, etc.<br />Essentially their job was to monitor me and try to figure out what was wrong with me based on my symptoms.<br />I was comfortably numb and the nurses were very sweet and accommodating for the most part.<br />My doctor was surprisingly competent at ruling thing out quickly and reassuringly.<br /><br />I would have been bored out of my mind, but I had some stuff with me to keep me busy and my mind occupied.<br />I had both my cell phone and laptop with TAILS on it with me, along with all my essential belongings.<br />My mind started playing tricks on me, and I started slurring my speech and sporadically blacking out.<br />Soon after this my doctor and his staff started pinpointing the symptoms.<br /><br />They ran CT Scans and MRI&#039;s along with hosts of other tests.<br />Almost immediately after my brain scans they found a lesion.<br />At first I was quite concerned, but after they calmly explained what a simple procedure it would be I said lets go for it. <br />The mortality rate even with complications at my age is extremely low.<br /><br />Quoting directly from *clearnet* http://www.medicinenet.com/brain_lesions_lesions_on_the_brain/page2.htm#what_are_brain_lesions<br />http://www.medicinenet.com/brain_lesions_lesions_on_the_brain/page2.htm#what_are_brain_lesions<br /><br />&quot;What are brain lesions?<br />A brain lesion describes damage or destruction to any part of the brain. It may be due to trauma or any other disease that <br />can cause inflammation, malfunction, or destruction of a brain cells or brain tissue. A lesion may be localized to one part <br />of the brain or they may be widespread. The initial damage may be so small as to not produce any initial symptoms, but <br />progresses over time to cause obvious physical and mental changes.<br />A brain lesion may affect the neuron directly or one of the glial cells thereby indirectly affecting neuron functions.&quot;<br /><br />This has been causing my body all sorts of problems, and probably why none of my posts made any sense.<br />My mind was literally full of poison and causing all these strange physical problems as well.<br />They prepped me for surgery and used conscious sedation, what at this point may have not even been necessary.<br />I had already crashed hard several times, <br />I was in excellent hands the entire time, my doctor was fantastic.<br />The legion was essentially poisoning my mind and prevented my body from functioning correctly.<br /><br />Everything from that point was a complete blur.<br />As quick as it began, it was over and I was in the recovery room.<br />The surgery itself was completely painless.<br />Considering the timing and when my symptoms started, this fast diagnosis <br />I understand that I sounded like a ranting lunatic, and that&#039;s technically because I was mentally a wreck.<br /><br />They expect me to recover 100% and they discharged me early this morning.<br />I&#039;m extremely sleep deprived, but my weight is slowly gaining back, and my brain is slowly returning to what it should have been.<br />I&#039;m finally back home safe and sound, and feel better than I have in over 10 years.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s truly miraculous.&nbsp; I&#039;m having the most blessed day today.&nbsp; <br />I gave my mom the biggest hug, and told here that everything would work out - and that was thanks to all the support around me especially the Silk Road community.<br />This was actually one of the most positive experiences I&#039;ve had in my entire lifetime.<br />Knowing that I wasn&#039;t crazy and it really wasn&#039;t some bad trip or hypochondriac panic attack.<br /><br />On top of everything,&nbsp; I now have a beautiful wonderful girlfriend that works at the hospital that was my &quot;nurse&quot; and we are now dating officially as of this morning.&nbsp; <br />She loves Weed, MDMA, LSD, and Electronic Dance Music and festivals.&nbsp; This is the first women in my entire lifetime of searching that seems almost perfectly compatible for my lifestyle.<br />She is just a beautiful person inside and out and we instantly had a deep connection and some extremely insightful and eye opening talks.<br />Instead of looking down upon my drug use, she accepted it understood it, and was compassionate about it.&nbsp; We talked for hours, and hours.<br />It will be absolutely beautiful to trip with her and explore our minds and bodies.<br />Considering I&#039;m a skeleton I&#039;m extremely lucky to have a lovely, beautiful, busty, employed women that deeply cares about me.&nbsp; <br />I really can&#039;t ask for anything else - it&#039;s like everything was a dream and I had finally been awakened from my slumber.&nbsp; <br /><br />This proved to be extremely beneficial to my recovery considering I&#039;ve been pussy deprived on top of being beyond sleep deprived.<br />Plus I started to withdrawal from all the shit I had been putting into my body, and things got pretty rough.<br />I highly recommend using this over water for detoxing and cleaning your body, it coats your stomach and allows nourishment and electrolytes to soak into you.<br />*clearnet*http://www.nakedjuice.com/our-products/juice/green-machine<br />I have stocked up on 10 jugs and plan on drinking them until my body returns to more or less normal.<br />Right now I&#039;m just sleep deprived and in moderate pain, but hey I&#039;ve been through much worse.<br />Luckily everything turned out perfect, and I can&#039;t ask for anything more. <br />It&#039;s strange how being so sick you can find terms to come to peace with it and finally accept that you have to get better and start your life over again.<br /><br />I have this radiant glow inside of me today and remain really happy and optimistic.<br />Without the Silk Road community none of this would have ever been possible.&nbsp;

I&#039;ve waited my entire life waiting for this moment!<br /><br />Love you guys so much, and I hope there is no bad blood between any of us.<br />I don&#039;t plan on leaving the road ever, and my outlook on life has completely changed.<br />This is my home and where I belong.<br />The clarity this has given me has essentially given me another chance at living the life that I deserved to live in the first place.<br />At this point, I&#039;m so relived and thankful for everything.<br />My god you guys are all amazing.<br />Each and every one of you.<br /><br />May we never let the Road ever be lost, as this is the only thing in the world that matters anymore.<br />Our world is in such a state of shambles, that Silk Road is the only saving grace.<br />This is the best place in the world, and lets do everything in our power to keep it that way.<br />Long live Silk Road, and my gratitude and love go out to everyone - even if you doubted me or what you think of me as a human being.<br />I plan to stay very active in the community and will be getting healthy and posting reviews, updates, trip reports, and answering questions and making guides on all sorts of stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />My brain and health are finally clear.&nbsp; Now it&#039;s time to rest, try and sleep, gain weight, and start getting some exercise.&nbsp; <br />I have mapped out a routine for all the lifestyle changes that are necessary to recover.<br />I&#039;m already feeling much better, but somehow I need to manage to sleep longer than 1-3 hour intervals.<br />Plus I plan on taking a deep and introspective journey into my new found life tonight, and hopefully it&#039;s a glowing success.<br />As tonight&#039;s weather is nothing short of astounding.&nbsp; Go outside and enjoy your lives, don&#039;t take them for granted and embrace your infinite knowledge and expand upon the mundane.<br />Make tonight special, and let&#039;s party like Silk Roadies proudly should.<br /><br />Eternally yours and with the utmost respect and gratitude to anyone and everyone, positive or negative.<br />You are what pushed me through this, I only did what was necessary to survive.<br />Much love to everyone, friend or foe.&nbsp; At this point I owe everyone my life.<br />You all have my respect until the day I die, and this won&#039;t be for a very long time now. <br />Thanks to you all, you have given me another opportunity to start fresh.<br />I cannot say thank you enough.<br />Grabbing my heaviest Indica and going to try and smoke myself to sleep.<br /><br />Love you all,<br />Vanquish<br /><br />:)<br />

				I read your stuff railing against shrooms and I have to say that we had sober/healthy people in here coming across waaaaaaay more crazy than that :P<br /><br />We haven&#039;t interacted before, but for what it&#039;s worth I&#039;m sending good vibes your ways and hope your recovery goes well and excellent. I consider all good and honest SRoadies my brutha from anutha mutha.<br /><br />Dunchu worry about them folks here, I think you will be just fine on that front. Just concentrate on getting well (might want to lay off the self-medication with about 30 different chemicals at once though&nbsp; ;D)<br /><br />Get well man! Let your body heal and recover and be back stronger than before. I wish you the best...

				@goodshitexplorer Seriously, I would tune in. Kim K could play the big-boobed druggified Florence Nightingale.<br /><br />@7Kz2 TL;DR<br /><br />&nbsp;On last week&#039;s episode of the Silk Road Soap Opera, our valiant hero Vanquish had an adverse reaction to some shrooms he was testing from a drug dealer whom he&#039;d contacted via the secret internet. Thankfully, due to his elite pharmacological knowledge he saved himself from the claws of death and being unable to pee with a heady mix of methamphetamine and opiates. After snapping on the latex gloves and investigating his own excrement, he pleaded with drug lords not to revoke his drug reviewing powers on an online message board and vowed to check into rehab. Unfortunately after burying his stash in the woods by torchlight in the dead of night after worrying LE were after him, he was whisked to hospital. From his bed in intensive care and whilst having cardiograms, MRIs and other tests, he posted a series of updates online about his failing health and the fact that he weighed just over 100lbs. Finally he begged for forgiveness from the entire Silk Road community as he slid in and out of consciousness. In this nail-biting cliffhanger only God, DPR&#039;s heartwarming words or ICU doctors could save him.<br /><br />THE CURRENT EPISODE:<br /><br />After viewers paced around waiting for an update for a full 28 hours with no word, it turned out that our brave hero had suffered a brain lesion, not a bad mushroom trip as everyone had initially thought. Luckily it was removed by doctors whilst he was in a medically-induced coma. And he left the ADVANCED care unit of the ICU 15 minutes after awaking from this operation with a new positive outlook on life. He also had a new busty nurse girlfriend who shares his love of tripping and illicit drugs that he&#039;d met whilst in hospital who had no doubt thrown caution to the wind and gone ahead and dated a patient - despite it being absolutely illegal. But what big bazookered chick can resist a heroic death-defying, self-proclaimed &quot;sleep and pussy deprived&quot; skeleton eh?<br /><br />Tune in next episode for more adventures from our loveable hero and his trusty new sidekick.<br /><br />:D<br /><br />

It may be due to trauma or any other disease that <br />can cause inflammation, malfunction, or destruction of a brain cells or brain tissue. A lesion may be localized to one part <br />of the brain or they may be widespread. The initial damage may be so small as to not produce any initial symptoms, but <br />progresses over time to cause obvious physical and mental changes.<br />A brain lesion may affect the neuron directly or one of the glial cells thereby indirectly affecting neuron functions.&quot;<br /><br />This has been causing my body all sorts of problems, and probably why none of my posts made any sense.<br />My mind was literally full of poison and causing all these strange physical problems as well.<br />They prepped me for surgery and used conscious sedation, what at this point may have not even been necessary.<br />I had already crashed hard several times, <br />I was in excellent hands the entire time, my doctor was fantastic.<br />The legion was essentially poisoning my mind and prevented my body from functioning correctly.<br /><br />Everything from that point was a complete blur.<br />As quick as it began, it was over and I was in the recovery room.<br />The surgery itself was completely painless.<br />Considering the timing and when my symptoms started, this fast diagnosis <br />I understand that I sounded like a ranting lunatic, and that&#039;s technically because I was mentally a wreck.<br /><br />They expect me to recover 100% and they discharged me early this morning.<br />I&#039;m extremely sleep deprived, but my weight is slowly gaining back, and my brain is slowly returning to what it should have been.<br />I&#039;m finally back home safe and sound, and feel better than I have in over 10 years.&nbsp; <br />It&#039;s truly miraculous.&nbsp; I&#039;m having the most blessed day today.&nbsp; <br />I gave my mom the biggest hug, and told here that everything would work out - and that was thanks to all the support around me especially the Silk Road community.<br />This was actually one of the most positive experiences I&#039;ve had in my entire lifetime.<br />Knowing that I wasn&#039;t crazy and it really wasn&#039;t some bad trip or hypochondriac panic attack.<br /><br />On top of everything,&nbsp; I now have a beautiful wonderful girlfriend that works at the hospital that was my &quot;nurse&quot; and we are now dating officially as of this morning.&nbsp; <br />She loves Weed, MDMA, LSD, and Electronic Dance Music and festivals.&nbsp; This is the first women in my entire lifetime of searching that seems almost perfectly compatible for my lifestyle.<br />She is just a beautiful person inside and out and we instantly had a deep connection and some extremely insightful and eye opening talks.<br />Instead of looking down upon my drug use, she accepted it understood it, and was compassionate about it.&nbsp; We talked for hours, and hours.<br />It will be absolutely beautiful to trip with her and explore our minds and bodies.<br />Considering I&#039;m a skeleton I&#039;m extremely lucky to have a lovely, beautiful, busty, employed women that deeply cares about me.&nbsp; <br />I really can&#039;t ask for anything else - it&#039;s like everything was a dream and I had finally been awakened from my slumber.&nbsp; <br /><br />This proved to be extremely beneficial to my recovery considering I&#039;ve been pussy deprived on top of being beyond sleep deprived.<br />Plus I started to withdrawal from all the shit I had been putting into my body, and things got pretty rough.<br />I highly recommend using this over water for detoxing and cleaning your body, it coats your stomach and allows nourishment and electrolytes to soak into you.<br />*clearnet*http://www.nakedjuice.com/our-products/juice/green-machine<br />I have stocked up on 10 jugs and plan on drinking them until my body returns to more or less normal.<br />Right now I&#039;m just sleep deprived and in moderate pain, but hey I&#039;ve been through much worse.<br />Luckily everything turned out perfect, and I can&#039;t ask for anything more. <br />It&#039;s strange how being so sick you can find terms to come to peace with it and finally accept that you have to get better and start your life over again.<br /><br />I have this radiant glow inside of me today and remain really happy and optimistic.<br />Without the Silk Road community none of this would have ever been possible.&nbsp;

He&#039;s about to cheese when two agents break in and confiscate the two cats he has there]<br />Agent 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[voice only] Got two here.<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! What the hell are you doing?!<br />Agent 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, these are illegal.<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What?! Hey! Give them back! [the agents toss the cats into the van] Give them back!! [the van drives off.]<br />[Cartman&#039;s house. Three agents comb the living room]<br />Cartman:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep &#039;cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary.<br />[South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Butters stands around while Cartman and Stan visit their lockers. Kyle walks up to them.]<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guys, have you seen Kenny?<br />Stan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I think Kenny&#039;s out sick today.<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn&#039;t here because he&#039;s at home cheesing.<br />Butters:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waww come one. Uh-Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.<br />Stan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They&#039;ve been outlawed.<br />Cartman:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pot&#039;s illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn&#039;t been the same. You&#039;ve all noticed the change in him. I&#039;ll bet Kenny&#039;s a t home cheesing right now.<br />[Kenny&#039;s hallucination. He&#039;s back in the alternate world, this time riding a giant bird, but the landscape is the same - breast shapes are everywhere. Kenny sees the woman from his first trip, but now she&#039;s strapped onto a rack and is being whipped by three burly men. These men are mutants with four breasts instead of two, and two more breasts on their shoulders. Kenny gets pissed at her treatment. She sees him fly by. Kenny lands and hops off the bird, finds a metal spear nearby, and lauches it. It strikes the red-shirted mutant man through the neck and out the sternum, killing him. Kenny then runs to the woman, but stops short. She winks at him and he sets her free. They both ride on the giant bird, with the woman&#039;s boobs riding on Kenny&#039;s head]<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!<br />[Kenny&#039;s house. Kyle, Stan, and Butters stand outside his door. Kyle pounds at the door.]<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny? [pounds three more times]<br />Stan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny, you home? [Kenny screams some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them. One of them is black]<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[really high] Wooooo. Look at me! Look at me! [the black cat runs out]<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny!<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[still makingn flying motions] Lookkk at me! Wooooooo!<br />Butters:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa boy, he&#039;s cheesed out of his mind! [Kenny flutters some more, stops, and passes out, falling to the floor]<br />Stan, Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny!<br />[Moments later, Kenny is at the dining room table. A lock of his hair peeks out from under his hood. Butters has prepared a cup and gives it to him. Stan and Kyle stand nearby]<br />Butters:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you go. Wuh try some coffee, Ken.<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunf. Hrrrr.<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No we don&#039;t, guys.<br />Stan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we do. We&#039;re your friends, dude. We&#039;re not gonna let you ruin your life.<br />Kenny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;m not ruining my life, okay, you Goddamned fucking psychos.<br />Kyle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at yourself! You&#039;ve got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters&#039; face and shirt.]<br />Butters:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#039;s it little buddy. Just let it out.

				In all seriousness though Vanquish much as I love to read about your crazy adventures and they&#039;ve given me a good giggle (and made me worried for you at times), it&#039;d be good if you don&#039;t get too close to the edge again for a bit. I know a bit of dedicated self-destruction&#039;s fun, but it&#039;d be a relief for your army of readers if you don&#039;t come close to death again for a wee while yet (or, in fact, for a long time). <br /><br />Last week sounded like you had an awful time of it and that it was pretty terrifying, distressing and unhappy for you, so whilst I am a fan of sex, drugs, rocking and rolling all night long, I&#039;m also a fan of people staying serene, happy and healthy. <br /><br />But on a brighter note, perhaps some sexy time with the nurse is in order this weekend? I&#039;d love a trip report about that ;) You could maybe call that episode, &#039;Thanks for the mammaries&#039;... ;-)-<br /><br />I&#039;ve given you a +1 karma to help get the, ahem, juices flowing... <br /><br />&lt;3 xo

				Damn ya&#039;ll been trying to login to the forums forever, and finally just got on.&nbsp; <br />Think my VPN may have solved the issues, but I&#039;m pretty sure this is effecting everyone in some capacity.<br />Anyways, just checking in that all is alive and well on this front.<br />I&#039;ve just been smoking, eating, and sleeping.<br />All of which has been much needed.<br />Just wanted to drop by and +1 GSE for his amazing recipe for making things hot and steamy.<br />I like that, A LOT!<br /><br />Plus Rem, Thanks for the Mammaries&#039; is a brilliant title for the next episode.&nbsp; :)<br />Just wanted to let you guys know that I&#039;ve been hit with the ToR issues, and I&#039;m working on solving them.<br />Right now or at least for now the VPN is working - but it&#039;s been very sporadic at best to stay logged in.<br />Hope you guys are having a kick ass week, and may you enjoy your weekend thoroughly! <br /><br />&lt;3 Vanquish
