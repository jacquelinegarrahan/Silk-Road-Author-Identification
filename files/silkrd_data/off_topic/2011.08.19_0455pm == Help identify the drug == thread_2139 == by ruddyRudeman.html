				Hello peoples, I want your help to identify the substance my body had to metabolize resently. It was a blotter, bought from some local vendor ocasionally. He called it &quot;some sort of LSD, though not tested yet&quot;. It was my first psychodelic, but even so I understood it was not LSD from the moment the paper touched my tongue. It had quite strong bitter taste. The effects started in about an hour, but they were not really overwhelming. Some visual distortion, pulsing geometric fractals with eyes closed, little moving grain on textures with eyes opened. Mind effects were much more intence. Time seemed to change its pace all the time. My friend (on that thing too) and I went outside for a walk. Everything - trees, skies and clouds - were ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Could look at them for ever, as I thought. Then I started to think of my life. I understood that I have done so much wrong way all my life. I thought of my pastself as of another man, and I knew I would never be him again. But who am I?.. well, those kind of thoughts. BTW, every 5 minutes or so something switched in me and I started to thing about something completely different in a new way, as if somebody turned pages with different moods and thoughts to make me start it all with a tabula rasa. It was a veeery long trip, something most saturated and interesting in all my life. And unlike lucy (which I tried afterwards) the mood of my newself ready to do everything didn&#039;t vanish several days afterwards, not a bit of withdrawal syndrome. During the trip there were times when I got hot and cold and hot again several times. It was quite unpleasant, I even started to be afraid. The whole trip lasted about 20 to 25 hours, and I could not sleep at all another 10 hours afterwards (though I was really tired). Long time after the trip I felt very kind to averybody, ready to hug every living creature. So the substance made me feel completely new man - something LSD did not even nearly do. So, what could that be? I want to repeat such a trip. Could it be some 2C, and if so, which one? Or may be some DOB or DOI or something like this?
