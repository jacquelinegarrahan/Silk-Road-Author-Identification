				thats an interresting anwser for me,me especially i´m polytox (polytox is my nick almost everywhere ;) ) and use every medicamentiation i can source (upper,benozs,weed and psychedelica) to have my fun everyday and less my depressions ( ik if i have depressions life is hard and sucks,i was since 3 years not happy anymore) <br /><br />would appreciate if some follow member can pm with me an talk a bit with me, honestly my friends i have are not trusthworthy, and myself is a person that show no emotional sites. ( i must say i have problems with my body too. no ego,no self-confidence can´t speak to girls unddrugged ( and if aundrugged its also not easy for me. if some follow member can talk a bit with me i aprreciate it really, i will aslo pay for some infos and tips. its meanwhile 4-years since i have some meantal problems duuo the wesmoking and maybe drugs. yeah its strange to tell my life in short that all cean read it. but i came to the point that my life broken, i can´t afford important things and have some derious decisions to make.<br /><br /><br />if anybody can speak with me a bit it would be nice i can´t tell other friends in my area and SR knows all situoastion to handle.<br /><br />yeah offcourse that was not all the badest thing comeing after i pm with an member,<br /><br />i would also pay a bit for helping me my problems solved...... live sucks dudes:(
