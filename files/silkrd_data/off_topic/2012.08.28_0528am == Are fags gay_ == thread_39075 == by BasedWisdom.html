				It seems I have incured negative karma! I don&#039;t understand this system. Does one vote to give karma? Or is negative or positive karma decided by a higher source? Isn&#039;t negativity and positivity in the eye of the beholder? Who decides such things! This can alter a persons individual judgement! Logic pls? Thank you all and love you all! 8)

				Nah I get it, only those with hero status get to decide karma. But I feel it is a little hypocritical, although a much better system than societies current, I think you should only base karma on the reliability of their selling and/or buying, rather than judgment on what people say. Everything everyone says is positive. Even if it doesn&#039;t seem so on the surface, if you did not know negativity then how would one know positivity? Such judgements on what people say are, I think, wrong. But I still love this site and the whole concept, and do not blame you for this system, it seems the fairest I&#039;ve come across! Love yall! 8)

				The concept of putting individuals in power more so than others based on irrelevancies such as what they is based around the same concept as common politics. I believe in whole equality. 8)

				You know, I kind of repent what I said. How does one strive without heirachy? That&#039;s what I should ask myself.&nbsp; But the answer is, through empathy of other. What is my agenda? To find truth. To find equality. What is yours fine sir?

				People over complicate things. Level 8 is not some mystical place where you have to fight dragons and fend off gremlins to discover. The levels refer to how much love you have revealed in your heart. It is sooo simple. But everyone thinks different, so it holds them back. Just love. Simple. 8) See beauty in all things. Haha message me if you wanna talk more about it man.

				Yes I just talked with guru and he smoothened things out. Smoothened. Not a word. Right. Hahah. But yes I&#039;ve come to realise the irrelevance in my argument becuase the ratings on here and the actual auctions are 2 different things. That&#039;s all good. I was just sussing this site out to see it&#039;s true fool-proofness. It&#039;s very good! Cudos to whoever made this!
