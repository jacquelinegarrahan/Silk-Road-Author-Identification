				Lol. Yep, i feel you. We are all sick of this spamming loser. I hope someone finds him and cuts off both his hands so he can never type again. And if he still fucks around using voice control software they come back and remove his voicebox.

				I&#039;ve had three of them so far tonight. *sigh*.<br /><br />Hope SR Admin sort the problem out soon!<br /><br />Scam must be working, obviously, otherwise they wouldn&#039;t keep on doing it!<br /><br />If you fall for a scam like this, you shouldn&#039;t be on SR, full stop.<br /><br />Fingers crossed the problem is solved soon everyone!&nbsp; :)<br />

				I think its some loser with nothing better to do with his miserable existence. Posts like these are probably doing more harm than good because I bet hes getting off on this shit now. Ignoring this douche is probably the best option, but its so damn hard to resist tearing this fucker up like a kleenex at a snot party.&nbsp; :D <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had three spam messages tonight also. It doesn&#039;t bother me too much. I just quietly delete them. I figure it&#039;ll fade eventually. The kind of user that would fall for this scheme (while unfortunate), would likely not have the savvy to stay on SR very long. <br /><br />Cheers! I enjoy stimulating some lively chatter what&#039;o!

				my rebuttal is this. A vendor (or trusted member) might be inactive for a month only to return and see that their nym has been re-registered and is being used to scam. If this were a private forum, then yes, prune it up, but this is public so it would be easy if say Mitanox&#039;s account was pruned, and tony76 registered the nym with a coming back sale that took another 200k<br /><br />granted this theory jumps to the conclusion that the forum account creation would allow them to access the original store account with the same nym and stats, and I will stop right there before I go too far, but it could happen.

				why cant they just require a captcha before anyone can reply or post anything on the forums? This asshole is obviously using a bot and a captcha would make it so he had to physically go through to each subforum and manually copy and paste then put in the captcha before he could post. I know hes a loser with nothing else better to do, but it might just deter the fucker enough to end this crap.

				^ I think he might enjoy the cummed part, so i vote for stepped on, lol.<br /><br />Nice wretched. Yea it seems even more plausible now. I dont really have any programming skills, so i just shot it out there as an idea but i really think its a good one. Although it might not completely stop the spammer, it might just annoy him like he continues to do to us.

				I believe kmf also linked to mods for smf that are designed to specifically address spam, but as they are indepentend mods, testing must be done to make sure there are no security holes introduced in them. the screenshots I posted are out of the box functionality and while they might not stop the spam, it could slow it down, or at least change the language.
