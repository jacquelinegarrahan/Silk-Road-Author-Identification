				What a great fucking idea!?! <br /><br />We should all consider doing this! <br /><br />Kind of like how the communists infiltrated the media in the past 50 years. <br />It&#039;s worked for them! I mean look who&#039;s president!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Seriously though, think about it. Everyone who can, say spare 20 hours a week.&nbsp; They still offer them from time to time. Usually in the rural areas. It&#039;s a plus if you have your own vehicle, since all the rural USPS trucks are shit boxes, they need all the help they can get. Per Diem and all that crap. I have a friend that uses his BOAT and get&#039;s reimbursed for it! (They also cover airplanes and motorcycles). <br /><br />Think of it!<br />An underground army of Silk Road Postal workers!<br /><br />Gonna need some secret handshake shit or something.&nbsp; ;D

				Why are you such a stupid cunt? Were you dropped on your head as a baby? why do people have no control over what comes out of their mouth? Do you feel special you had a good idea and just told the whole world about it? <br /><br />Part time? where is your commitment? You should follow the yellow brick road first and find a heart might as well get a brain while you&#039;re there. I think you would get lost and they are on the same street. I dont think you could cut it on a pamphlet round and all the letters are the same.&nbsp; you dont need to remember streetnames or anything.<br /><br />Now you want to complicate things and deliver really important stuff to people who really depend on it?&nbsp; You will have to put the right letters in the right box. 100% accuracy. I bet you think they have a machine or people to sort all that shit into an efficient order. That will be your job.&nbsp; What the fuck will you do when its pissing rain?&nbsp; &nbsp;You cant just do the first 10 houses then go tip the rest in the bin at the shops. the Feds will be waiting for you at home..&nbsp; and they wont need a warrant.<br /><br />But i bet you wouldn&#039;t last long enough in the job to see your first order so none of it matters.

				Would OP be buying or selling the drugs?&nbsp; If you have 20+ hours a week to spare then go for it but I&#039;m curious as to how this would specifically help things out for the OP.&nbsp; There will still be some other employees there and what if your packages come when you&#039;re not working?&nbsp; Better yet what happens if they catch one with drugs in it and it has your name on it?<br /><br />I&#039;m not doubting that this could work, just curious as to which parts of the job will really help.&nbsp; Does the USPS let you pick whichever position you want?&nbsp; Are they even hiring right now with their budget problems?

A homeboy. The first fucking thing the feds done was storm the office and ask all the employees questions about the routes, the customer, the house it was going to. Well by the time they could get a proper operation in tact and implement it my homie (vendor) was all ready and had his shit A1! I&#039;m talking everything that needed to be done for his drop to not be completely fucked was done. Well he played it like the pro he is but the whole reason he knew is because he had an inside man.<br /><br />I honestly just want to learn more about how things work and how to fully exploit them, how &quot;we&quot; can fully exploit them. I want to study their inner workings and then slowly carve them out with my knowledge.<br /><br />They are still hiring, you can go on their site and find listings in your area! I seen custodial, mail routes, customer service, all kinds of good looking shit...<br /><br />Could you just imagine if you and 15-20 friends all ran a complete office on your own. Wow, lol...<br /><br />Honestly, if you were a regional supervisor or manager, this would be the most ideal imo.<br /><br />They would be alerted of anything far before anyone knew I&#039;d imagine.

				I&#039;m pretty sure the packages are controlled more by the countries who receive them.<br />I think most governments don&#039;t really care about drugs leaving the country, governments think the less drugs in my country the better,<br />In the end the receiving countries has stress with fighting dealers and drug problems.<br /><br />This aren&#039;t facts, but I think it would makes quite sense. ^^

				Yeah I&#039;m pretty sure no one is xraying packages LEAVING their country.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got way more concern for things coming IN.<br /><br />I&#039;d say the worst, or at least I&#039;ve HEARD, the worst is Australia for incoming packages.&nbsp; Anything coming from The Netherlands usually looks a bit suspicious though.
