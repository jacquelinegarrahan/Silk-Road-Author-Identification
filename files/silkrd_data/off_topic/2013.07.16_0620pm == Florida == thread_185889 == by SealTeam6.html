				There is so much beauty in Florida off the beaten path, that the rat fucking q tip tourists, and their shitty grandkids will never know about. Cruising on the East Coast, go up to St. Augustine, and check out the limestone caves on Anastasia Island. That was always one of my family&#039;s favorite places to watch the sunrise, camped out, amazed and stunned by the majesty of the Atlantic. <br /><br />On the west coast, there is this cool little place, a manatee sanctuary in Apollo beach. Right next to the TECO cooling area, where they jet the sea water back into the bay, the manatees gather for warmth and safety. It is so calm, peaceful, take the boardwalk out into the mangroves, and lose yourself in reverie. <br /><br />Food, ah glorious food. In Tampa there is this place called Skippers Smokehouse. I have had the best alligator there, and they usually have some sort of indie music thing happening. Hell, they were part of the Diner&#039;s Driviens and Dives best sandwich contest, for their Ruben sandwich. I am salivating right now thinking about it. I love the state, haven&#039;t been there in years, but it is beautiful with lots of variety. Go down to Sarasota, see the Ringling Museums, check out Bishop Planetarium and get a laser light show in, and have a night on the town.&nbsp;

				If it wasn&#039;t for Florida, George W. Bush would never have gotten elected. (Thanks, Jeb! nudge nudge, wink wink)<br /><br />(sarcasm... Even if you like Dubya, there&#039;s really nothing to like about election fraud. Remember the &quot;dangling chads&quot;?)<br /><br />But they do have awesome beaches in Florida...<br /><br />
