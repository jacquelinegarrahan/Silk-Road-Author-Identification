				I display all the symptoms of ADD. I have been very dysfunctional my whole life because of it. I&#039;ve never abused drugs. But doctors won&#039;t prescribe me ADD medication. They want to withhold from me that which will treat me. I would much rather take a milder psychostimulant like Ritalin than meth, but meth is the only thing I can get that actually works. I fucking hate doctors, they deserve to be shot.

				Ritalin sucks. The ADD is part of your personality and you have to learn to live with it. Ritalin won&#039;t make the symptoms disappear magically.

				My doc (before prescribing me ritalin for ADD I do not have) told me that a lot of people with ADD do end up on meth and speed and it makes them feel normal. You need to find a doctor who the Adderall people are sending to retreats and giving them pens and money :)

Mental discipline can only alter your dopamine levels so much. Some people really do need psychostimulants to function. I can&#039;t function without stimulants, and before I discovered stimulants, I was even more dysfunctional than I am now.

Whether it&#039;s for the good or bad, research has allowed for the broadening of the autism spectrum and what it may entail. There have been several reports of children/adolescents, even adults who were originally diagnosed as ADD/ADHD in the past, but now better fit the criteria for autism. I&#039;m not saying that you are autistic, but I am saying that advancements in medicine have allowed us to reach a more accurate diagnosis. <br />Also, in regards to you not being able to get a script due to you being in adulthood, my dad was recently prescribed Adderall solely because he asked his doctor for it so that he could get more stuff done - those were pretty much his exact words. He can&#039;t drink coffee or energy drinks because it gives him heart palpitations, oddly enough. <br /><br />Also, once again, self-medicating with a highly addictive, highly neurotoxic substance is not helping you in any way. If by chance you do get a prescription, you&#039;ll likely be even worse due to the meth that even Adderall won&#039;t be of help..What are you going to do then?<br /><br />sdesu

Although I&#039;m told there is no such thing as &quot;adult-onset ADHD&quot;, if you describe your ADHD symptoms that have been occurring since childhood, that&#039;s just regular ADHD that you didn&#039;t get diagnosed with until now. Many people don&#039;t realize they have had it for their whole lives until they get to college and their self-developed coping mechanisms no longer are good enough to keep them acting normal.
