				Guys...I have no sex drive.<br /><br />I have sex w/my spouse maybe once a week, in a good month. I take zoloft, about 50mg a day. I am weening off, I am now taking 25mg a day. I plan to ween off entirely, but it will be a long run. I feel/think the zoloft has played a roll. Maybe it&#039;s boredom and that&#039;s a bad thing.<br /><br />At any rate. Does anybody have any suggestions? I ordered some molly, but I don&#039;t believe the wife will be down...:( This makes it hard to expand feelings/emotions, and have experiences with her. <br /><br />Not sure what to do, but I fear for my marriage nonetheless. <br /><br />-onion-

				Pramipexole HCL (clearnet http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramipexole)<br /><br />You&#039;re mileage may vary. My girlfriend gets a LOT more love when I am taking that stuff. A LOT. I also jerk off A LOT more often. <br /><br />Also, not to be too Dr. friendly here but if you don&#039;t mind a conversation with the Dr. he might be able to do a testosterone test and see if maybe you are running a little low and offer some supplementation. A shot of test would likely get you feeling a little more young and randy.<br /><br />MDMA is FANTASTIC at creating a loving bond between partners, not so amazing at satisfying the actual intercourse. The speedy part of the MDMA normally shrinks me up. If I know I want to do a little loving on the drug I always take some Viagra with it but more often than not the loved up feeling is more than enough and sex actually requires a little effort.<br /><br />Last but not least, it might not even be you. I notice if my girlfriend is turned on I&#039;m normally pretty well turned on. Maybe try mixing things up a little. Have a nice massage night. Spend an hour eating her out. Buy her a new toy and tell her how much you want to see her play with it. Sometimes when you are in a long tern relationship it&#039;s easy to forget that the person you are with is a living sex godess that needs to be worshiped and when you look at them you just see the girl that cleans the kitchen.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck!

				Supplment with vitamin d, zinc, and mag.&nbsp; Studies show thay each one of these help raise test, a quick google search will reveal this and it works trust me, morning wood like a teenager.&nbsp; Start eating alot of healthy fats like peanuts, peanut butter, avocado, ect.&nbsp; A diet high in healthy fats will boost your hormones.&nbsp; The number one thing you can do to boost test levels is exercising!!

				haven&#039;t SSRI&#039;s been shown to generally cause an decrease in libido in some people, but not all, and with varying degree between all the different kinds of SSRI&#039;s? The zoloft may be what is killing your sex drive, did it ever happen before you took zoloft?<br /><br />edit: i meant decrease not increase, I&#039;m a dumbass

				It&#039;s most likely the Zoloft killing you&#039;re sex drive. Sexual side effects from antidepressants are very very common. Sometimes it&#039;s bad, sometimes its good, and every medication affects people differently. When I took zoloft a couple years ago it made me really horny all the time and I lasted a lot longer. When I was on paxil it killed my sex drive completely. No desire, no interest, sex seemed like a chore and I had trouble maintaining a boner.

				It is good to hear you are trying to get off the SSRI&#039;s -- If you have time; here is a very insightful documentary detailing the huge profits of creating a diagnostic and then administering a life threatening medication to people and being fully aware of the adverse affects. <br /><br />When money is around; compassion is absent. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UDlH9sV0lHU<br />

				Yep concur with others - the loss of sex drive is probably down to the Zoloft. <br /><br />In terms of drugs to get your libido up and running, try these combos, all of which have worked for me:<br /><br />Viagra or Cialis + sativa marijuana<br />Viagra or Cialis + MDMA<br />Viagra or Cialis + Methylone<br />Sativa marijuana + alcohol<br /><br />Best of luck now...

				First off, don&#039;t bother with any mdxx until a about a month after your last dose of Zoloft, else it will be a waste (they cancel each other out). <br /><br />In any case, one thing you can take while everything is clearing your system is GHB. Just be sure to start off on a low dose so you don&#039;t end up passing out instead. Your sex drive will soar and the euphoria is similar to MDMA --though unlike that stuff, it wont make you limp, hehe.

				get off the Zoloft dont take the MDMA with it.<br />Also for a lot of ppl MDMA causes impotence while the roll lasts. So be ready for that. <br />&nbsp;Why not try some psychedelics instead? 2c-b? <br />also mdma can save your marriage by helping you talk about the problems. but it will not solve it for you. you will have to solve it yourself. <br />Take a romantic vacation with your girl. Fuck in public, make it exciting and extreme if you have to.

				Hey onion,<br /><br />l1llykins above is correct on all points - SSRI&#039;s interfering with MDxx&#039;s and GHB being more effective than MDMA for sex while allowing a similar intimacy (not as deep as MDMA, but funnier, and a lot sexier).<br /><br />All SSRI&#039;s (inc Zoloft) are known to interfere with sex drive, and it is good that you are titrating your dose. And it will be very good to get off it altogether in time - it should be used as short-term intervention only.<br /><br />GHB is superb for enhancing sexual desire AND sexual function at the same time (a combination lacking in many other drugs used in the bedroom), and it is far more accessible as an experience than MDMA - so you wife may more readily be able to go there with you.<br /><br />The archetypal &quot;intimacy + sexuality&quot; combo is MDMA + 2C-B + GHB (in that order - taken sequentially). During the MDMA phase there is opportunity for going deep and resolving, and once you&#039;re into the 2C-B and GHB then you can get into integration and deep intimate fucking. There&#039;s nothing better - truly...<br /><br />BG<br />

				OKay short update from months ago from posting this.<br /><br />Stopped zoloft for several months. Stupid discontinuation sucked but I managed. Had several journeys on MDA, nothing over 60mg at once though. In fact that was my largest dose, everything else was less than 50mg each time. I had plenty of good times.<br /><br />Somewhere about a month after stopping, I began to decline. I felt like royal shit and I couldn&#039;t function anymore. I decided to start the zoloft again and I already feel better a few days into it. I am only at 25mg and plan to stay as low as possible dose-wise. <br /><br />Sex...still isn&#039;t something I think about often.

				You people are funny. I get this is an SR forum and were all about drugs but haven&#039;t any of you thought that the problem could be solved without narcotics? For instance the male body begins to supress testosterone production in your early thirties. The suppression happens quicker for males who have families or even one who&#039;s expecting a child. Researches have found that men naturally decrease their testosterone levels in order to emotionally connect with children and their spouse. It&#039;s where the instinct to care and protect your family comes from. So in turn they&#039;ve linked the decrease of testosterone with your sex drive (obviously). So therefore it could be a problem related to that (which a significant number of men who take Viagra and EDS pills have dicoveres they only need to increase hormone levels) as being in a relationship suppousidly starts in order to empathize with your partner. Maybe a consultation with a real doctor could help your libido last a whole lot longer than Molly or any boner pill you could take.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My apologies to those of you who have already mentioned this. Obviously I didn&#039;t mean you.

				If your in your 40&#039;s go to the doc and ask about hormone replacement therapy. If he&#039;s not having it then you can self medicate after extensive research.

				Get off the SSRi&#039;s Nasty fuckers.. <br /><br />Start taking Niacin AKA B3 start off small and work your way up till you feel &quot;right&quot; I&#039;m serious .. They have been doing GREAT work even with schizophrenics.. You can do really high dosages even up to around 5000mg per day.. BUT start off small and work your way up.. a lot of people that were living in group homes are now on about 3000MG per day and are now living on their own.. <br /><br />&nbsp;That is step one.. Step two is talking to her and reconnecting to her.. Maybe she would be okay with you taking the MDMA ( no less then 30 days off the SSRI&#039;s the longer then better) that way you guys can talk and you can dump out everything that is stuck in your head and that needs let out.. <br /><br />Maybe try some &quot;unorthadox&quot; play.. Dress up , role playing ect..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Bro Go to the doc and have your Test levels checked, it could be the testosterone levels are low, It happend to me, AND IM NOT EVEN FUCKING 30~~~!! Not to mention im on opiates ..<br /><br />But You can Take MDMA everytime u wanna have sex, its great when using it, but thats only a ban aid for the issue at hand..<br /><br />The ZOloft could be having allot to do with it..<br /><br />The is a actual doc on here named DOCTORX i think, speak with him... Guys who mention MDMA im not saying NO to it, but we all know when we were young and fucking like rabbits it wasnt cause of MDMA...&nbsp;
