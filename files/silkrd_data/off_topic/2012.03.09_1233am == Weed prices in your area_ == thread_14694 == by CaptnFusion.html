				Well I made this thread because I need some info on QP prices. (thread is in USD)<br /><br />Anyway, around here for the best bud around it&#039;s 340-380 for one ounce(up to 420 depending on the dealer)<br />60-65 for a 8th, 110-120 qo, 190-240 ho<br /><br />I need to know for weight though, soon I&#039;m going to buy a QP but my guys said 1250, which really isn&#039;t worth it, I&#039;d save only 47.5 per O.<br /><br />Let me know what prices for top shit is in your area.

				$100-200/oz, 2k/lb would be a good deal for AAAA/indoor/medical/top shelf/etc., but usually it&#039;s no more than 300/oz, 2.5k/lb.<br />Around here you can also get shake/trim/small buds for around 110/qp, 200/hp.&nbsp; Sooo a QP would be around 500-800.<br /><br />Yeaaaaa I wish I could start vending.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />In my area weed is fucking everywhere!&nbsp; 8)

				For the astute vendor, there&#039;s plenty of money to be made simply pushing product from one market to the next. Hence a preponderance of our Australian, Scandinavian and Kiwi friends flooding the forums.<br /><br />e.g. you can get 1g of coke for roughly $100 in New York (expensive) and sell it in New Zealand for $500 - $600.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the same situation with weed though, so you&#039;re shit outa luck there. Ask Hoffa to be certain.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I guess it&#039;s all in who you know.&nbsp; My close friend picks up like 20 pounds of AAA every week so I can usually get a QP for around $800-$850.&nbsp;

				Finland... Eastern part specifically. if you know someone who homegrowns thats great, prices are usually at 13-16e/gram and quality can differ greatly. but hash, its mostly so pathetic that i dont even bother buying anymore,&nbsp; ~13e per gram usually and quality is that you can smoke two grams in hour or two and effects are pretty nonexistent and after few hours you dont even notice that you have smoked anything, sometimes there is hash what you can actually smoke and feel good but price is still crappy for quality.<br /><br />Thats why SilkRoad is godsend in here, get great weed and i didnt even know that hash can be good before silkroad :D

				Around US$1.65 (R$3,00) a gram for brick weed.<br />Not less than US$22.10 (R$40,00) for indoor weed. Actually, in my area if you want indoor weed, you need to grow.

				Weed here is ridiculous. For chronic, which is about the best you&#039;re going to find here (just a bit better than mids) 20/g 60/eighth. For reggies then 40-50/eighth depending on who you&#039;re talking to.

				Here&#039;s the deal for a certain large city on the northeast coast of the US:<br /><br />1/8th = $50 (mids) $70 (fire)<br />1/4 = $100 (mids) $130 (fire)<br />1/2 = $180 (mids) $220 (fire)<br />1 oz = $350 (mids) $440 (fire)<br />A+++ medical grade shit served vacuum sealed = $50 for ~2g. Someone probably orders these pre-packaged from Cali, just like SR. lol<br /><br />Unfortunately, even the &quot;fire&quot; bud can be somewhat shitty around here. I don&#039;t care what it looks or smells like, if it&#039;s premature or was packed wet it&#039;s fucking garbage to me. Even when it&#039;s potent and smokeable, I still don&#039;t want to pay over $400 for some unflushed crap that burns like a fireworks fountain and tastes about as bad too.<br /><br />On SR I can order basically the same shit as the vacuum sealed bud for around $300 a zip, maybe $350 at most, and it&#039;s usually organic stuff that smokes like air. I hate waiting for it to come in the mail, but it sure beats gambling on the local crap.

Now a priority package coming out of Humboldt is about as suspicious a package as there could be. and thats just talking domestically. now imagine some guy is like o i want to do it internationally. he better be a packaging god. also it is easier to mail it back east (like NY/Chi/Philly) and get upwards of three grand for something i would pay him 1500 at the most for.

My guy gets Cali and Colorado shipments all the time. There seems to be such a flood in those states, they get it off much easier and for much more by shipping it out of state. I can understand not some of them not vending on SR, they can ship a pound out to a non-mm to someone they know for 3200-3700$ NO PROBLEM. as you can see from the prices in the non-mm, theres people dyeing to pay a little bit of a better price for some quality herb. <br /><br /><br />Me n my girlfriend are actually saving up money so we can move out there.
