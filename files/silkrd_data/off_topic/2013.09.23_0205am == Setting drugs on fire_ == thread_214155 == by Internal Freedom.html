				Ok, so lets assume that there&#039;s a guy named Ralph. ;D Now Ralph has made several orders off of SR from dozens of different vendors. He enjoys sampling each vendors own product and only buys high quality goods. Now lets say that Ralph enjoys trying NEW drugs and ordered some very good Valium and very good Ketamine.<br /><br />What if Ralph is an idiot and didn&#039;t check the dosage for the Valium and popped a whole 10mg to his face with no tolerance, then had INSANELY bad withdrawls for 5 days (worst hes ever had).<br /><br />Now skipping ahead to the Ketamine, what if Ralph snorted 4-5 bumps and was on the verge of K-Holing then realized how strange and uncomfortable he was, he gave it a second shot a few weeks later and still did not enjoy it and swore to never do it again.<br /><br />Then maybe he couldn&#039;t find any friends to give his products away too so one night after a few lines of some mighty fine coke he poured camping fuel on his two bags full of product and set them on fire and recorded it while laughing and yelling &#039;burn MOTHAFUCKA BURNNN&#039;. He didn&#039;t want to have them with him if he ever got busted because it would just add to everything else he has.<br /><br />Did Ralph do the right thing? I mean this is uhhh... all hypothetical right... haha yah..<br /><br />yah..

				Yah, if Ralph existed he would definitely be one fucked up motherfucker. I don&#039;t imagine the fumes from burning Valium and Ketamine were very nice for his nostrils either.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if Ralph DID exist he would tell you that he understands that 10mg is not a lot of Valium but he did not take any other drug for over a week before he took it, and that the day after he took it the EXTREME dizziness/weakness/dry mouth/stiffness came out of no where (all effects of Valium withdrawl) and lasted close to 5 days (first 3 days being the worst). I imagine Ralph would appreciate that you people know your shit, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be replying but he can assure you it was the Valium. Its possible the Valium Ralph got was tainted or something as he had no previous experience with it to compare too, someone beforehand mentioned dirty ones from pakistan or some shit.<br /><br />No ones said anything about the K, so I&#039;m just going to come out and say I SET A HALF GRAM OF K ON FIRE<br /><br />I had nothing to do with the Valiums though, that shits ALLLL on ralph. Sneaky fucker<br /><br />also, lol @ the negative karma for setting drugs on fire ;D

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Ralph really thought he was getting busted, this is a good idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;My preferred method of disposal is to mix it with piss and pour it onto a towel, the reasoning being that can&#039;t be proven in court that the drugs weren&#039;t already in your piss.&nbsp; Back when I used to sell weed, my friends and I devised a system where we had a stove with the drugs in it, suspended above the stash is a 5mil plastic canopy, covered 2cm deep in magnesium shavings.&nbsp; The idea is, if John Q. Law comes a knockin&#039;, and he&#039;s got a warrant, you throw/fire a flare into the bag.&nbsp; We even thought of putting one in the trunk of a car, with a propane tank and a trap-door to get rid of the ashes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The thought is, that destroying evidence carries less time than possession with intent to distribute.&nbsp; Hell, a lawyer costs so much that I&#039;ve thought of setting my car on fire rather than pay the retainer.&nbsp; Fuck the police! BURN BABY BURN! fuckers will give you 10yr for $50 worth of shit, in the US every user is automatically a dealer if they own an automobile.
