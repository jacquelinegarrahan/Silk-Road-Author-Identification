				Hashes have great variance, simply because there are so many ways to extract and process the trichomes into a purer THC product. I&#039;m not an expert on Middle Eastern hashes, but I have heard they hand rub their product over fine silk screens in order to attain the purity they desire. Obviously the finer the screen, the finer the end product. Most people judge hash quality on it&#039;s meltiness. Full melt being the top quality most go by, is pretty self explanatory. If the hash bubbles and melts completely with no ash, then you have yourself a very nice quality hash. Then it goes down from there to half melt, quarter melt, and anything lower than that isn&#039;t really worth mentionioning. Generally it&#039;s bubble hash which uses those grades, as bubble hash is filtered through several different size micron screens before the final product is finished. Again, the finer the screen, the meltier the product. The reason being, the finer the screen, the less plant matter that goes in, and the higher concentration of trichome heads, which results in a very melty hash. Dry sift, cold water extraction, ice water extraction, etc. There&#039;s numerous ways to get a very refined product.<br /><br />Then theres your hash oils which again vary with extraction method. The most common hash oil is BHO, which is simply extracted with triple or quadruple refined butane through some type of tube made out of non-reactive material like a stainless steel turkey baster, or a custom glass extractor. Then you heat or vacuum purge the product to evap all of the remaining butane, and are left with a golden gooey/hard/buddery/waxy substance, that varies greatly with ones technique and even environmental factors such as heat and humidity. Then you can go into CO2, ether, or even hexane extractions, which I&#039;m not familiar with.

Some lower quality hashes won&#039;t be as pleasant to vape, but it will still work. Your vape might get a little gunkier, but you can scrape out your vape goo, assuming you have some type of standing/box vape, and get high on that again.<br /><br />You do not want to fill up the bowl with hash, unless you want to get absolutely stupid fucking stoned. What I would do personally, is crumble up some hash and mix it with some greens. It will vape nicely and you&#039;ll conserve material. Hash is basically just very refined kief. So the rule of thumb I would say would be to use the same amount of hash as you would with your kief.

				Best hash I would think would be anything that has not been pressed.Then would come full melt Blacks (gold seals) these are hand rubbed so the Trichs stay together and melt as one next would be blondes&amp; Morrocans these are done by beating the plants in a room with a plastic sheet on the ground to catch the ruptured trichs gathered and pressed hard&nbsp;

				When I was growing weed full time (medical MJ) I used to make bubble hash quite often. I had an easy to use 3 filter bag setup that made some good hash. I&#039;d like to try some of the other kinds of hash available at SR.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />

				Best way to smoke hash: (like a Canadian)<br /><br />Bottle tokes, or rather &quot;bots&quot; or &quot;bods&quot; depending on your vocal dialect.<br /><br />Break up your hash into little ball like pieces and set them out on a tray like surface, like a book or cd case or cigarette pack. (Canadian 25 packs are best for this, I believe in America cigarettes only come in 20s)<br /><br />This works best with dark hash that does not crumble easily.<br /><br />Now take an empty bottle with a cap and burn one hole in the side large enough to fit a cigarette through easily.<br /><br />Light a cigarette.<br /><br />Pick up one bot at a time on the burning tip of the cigarette, let the smoke start to stream, and then insert it into the bottle through the hole with the cap on. When you see the hash has finished burning remove the cigarette, unscrew the cap and inhale, or leave the cap on and pass the bottle to your friend. Then repeat. <br /><br />This takes practice but its awesome. If you don&#039;t like cigarettes you might cough or get dizzy. <br /><br />If you do this in your car or bedroom you can pass the smell off as cigarettes, don&#039;t attempt while driving. Also be careful not to drop bots on your pants, most of my pants have burn holes in them from this. <br /><br />Btw the process is referred to as brewing, &#039;brewing bots.&#039;

				Ha, what a great topic. I just finished smoking smoking some of DutchShop&#039;s 00 and am nice and baked. :)<br /><br />To me, hash is like wine. Anyone can make wine but only a fraction of those people make wine good enough to be sold in stores. Furthermore, even a smaller number of vineyards make wine good enough to be featured in a magazine or high end restaurant. But when it comes right down to it, the alcohol content between a low end and a high end wine is both the same, and if you drink a bottle of either one of them you&#039;re going to get drunk. But one is going to have a better taste, better smell, and better overall experience than the other. <br /><br />Hash is much the same. I&#039;ve made good dry ice hash that gets me really fucking stoned but I&#039;d be embarrassed to show it to someone from Morocco. Well made Middle Eastern hash has much better texture, smell, appearance, and taste. When 4/5 senses are going crazy from experiencing high quality hash the feeling is almost sublime. <br /><br />This is a great video on how it&#039;s really done. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqIaYIOLeS4 &lt;- I love watching this.<br /><br />

				Hash gets you high, but weed gets you stoned ;) Perfect if you still want to be able to socialize. Good hashish is never hard, it should crumble when you break it. <br /><br />Personally i prefer it in the wintertime, summer is ganja time for me :)

Pure kief has to be shook off through a screen while the green particles are too big to go through the screen. The grinder grinds up the green to fit through, so grinder kief is generally greener.

Anyone can make wine but only a fraction of those people make wine good enough to be sold in stores. Furthermore, even a smaller number of vineyards make wine good enough to be featured in a magazine or high end restaurant. But when it comes right down to it, the alcohol content between a low end and a high end wine is both the same, and if you drink a bottle of either one of them you&#039;re going to get drunk. But one is going to have a better taste, better smell, and better overall experience than the other. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yes!&nbsp; I totally had this thought a few weeks ago when I received some hash from spanishfly...the texture, taste, smell, and rush were so fucking beautiful and I thought to savor the flavor like a fine wine.&nbsp; can&#039;t wait to buy a bunch more<br /><br />really having fun getting into different kinds of hash.&nbsp; got some moroccan on the way from undergroundsyndicate&nbsp; I hope its a good representative of the moroccan varieties of hash.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Butane extraction will get you oil... sticky, sticky oil.<br />I used to make a superhash by hand sifting the trichs, then I would take the remaining shake and do a butane extraction to get the remaining oils out.&nbsp; Then mix that shit together after removing the butane remnants and press it into a brick.&nbsp; Very sticky, and very potent.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking one hit off a joint with that in it would get me high, and the whole joint would just wreck me.<br /><br />Dutch&#039;s polm 00 is better.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s proly from a nice strain of weed and it&#039;s made properly, without additives. Super flavour.<br /><br />The most efficient way to smoke hash is doing blades.&nbsp; No waste.<br /><br />First I use a marble slab to place a bunch of little pieces of hash, just tiny &#039;lil things big enough to hold in your lungs without coughing out all your smoke.<br />I use a propane plumbing torch to heat up a couple butter knives and place a plastic cone made out of a pop bottle-top in my lips, and gently do a tap-twist to one of the hash bits to connect it to one knife.<br />I then place it under the cone (no touching!) and squash it down with the second red-hot blade while inhaling. This all takes about 3 seconds.&nbsp; While holding that smoke in, I then scrape the knives together to get rid of the charred remains, and place the blades back into the flame to heat back up for the next one.&nbsp; After about 20 of these I&#039;m ready to take on any task, or sleep, depending on the characteristics of the hash.&nbsp; :P

				The hash to fine wine comparison is perfect, I gained an appreciation for hash when I got to live overseas.&nbsp; Like the OP, I&#039;m an American and you just can&#039;t find hash here.&nbsp; The one person who I know sells it charges 50/g and it seems more like poor quality oil that has solidified (black and brown, but not like Thai hash).&nbsp; The high is good, but it isn&#039;t worth 50 bucks.<br /><br />But on SR, hash from all over the fucking world.&nbsp; So many different kinds, each one unique.&nbsp; Just reading through the hash page makes me feel like I&#039;m a kid in a candy store.&nbsp; I encourage anyone who doesn&#039;t have a lot of experience with hash to give it a try.

				FYI, Sonni http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0068dd9e07 just listed Menala Supercream and Nepali Temple Balls... I just ordered 2g of each.&nbsp; I remember seeing his items a couple months ago and have been kicking myself for not ordering; not this time tho!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Also, just got my moroccan hash from UnderGroundSyndicate and it is very nice hash.&nbsp; certainly not as strong as some other hash I have tried, but I don&#039;t see that as a bad thing.&nbsp; Its quite lucid and doesn&#039;t drain my physical energy at all, but keeps me nicely elevated.&nbsp; good stuff!

				here it goes. Regards Hash I would stick only to it if decent genuine hash was available constantly. Let me draw up my fears of buying #.<br />http://fakehash.com<br />That gives you more idea why some of hashes may not include any THC. Now why is is so bad? First what you can get is fake hash with no addition of artificial canabinols. That one has &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;smell&quot; but no buzz. You may have one which has very little of Artificial THC 4-8% and you are going to call it soapbar. Any of the fake ones is not even close to the poorest self-made pressed kiff. of course there are lovely hashes like malana cream or caramello dutch 00 or mexican sativa hash but it is not easy to find and buy the genuine one.... BTW missing Jezail very much.....

				Love this topic btw but would like to clear up 1 inconsistency I noticed.<br />@JMoney: A smaller screen does not necessarily mean better product, it depends wholly on which strain you are spinning or pulling because every flower has different sized trichomes &amp; the best quality hash is in the screen that will catch only the &quot;Trichome Heads.&quot; In order to figure out which size screen will hold your heads you need a special magnifying glass that&#039;s lined with increments so you can measure them, then you will truly know whether your &quot;Full-Melt&quot; is on the 73micron-screen, or the 60micron-screen, or whichever correlates with the size of your trichomes. This is the Bubble Hash method I am pertaining to, but the same goes with kiefed hash...<br /><br />I am not as consistent as the other hash vendors as I am constantly making trips from NorCal to SoCal &amp; back in order to maintain my IRL Clientes, so I only provide a small fraction of my products here, but I&#039;ve had some pretty good things said about my hash. I happen to have some available now if anyones interested. There&#039;s not much to go out on here so you&#039;ll have to get it quick. Also, I think it&#039;s pretty cheap compared to the other bubble vendors here &amp; that&#039;s got nothing to say about the quality. I&#039;m just not used to these outrageous prices because in the Emerald Triangle hash is almost free... <br /><br />Heres a link to the 4/20 thread I started for this same quality hash a while back so you can see what others have had to say about it: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18407.0<br /><br />And here&#039;s my official vendors thread with reviews of ALL my products: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=1175.0<br /><br />Take Care... :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-
