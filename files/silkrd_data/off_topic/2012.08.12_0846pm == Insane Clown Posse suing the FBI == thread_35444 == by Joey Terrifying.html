				love em or hate em, this move shows big fuckin balls.&nbsp; this is about more than creepy clowny hip hop, this is about freedom of speech, freedom of choice, and not bending over to receive the Man&#039;s cock because he&#039;s telling you to.<br /><br /><br />http://www.vice.com/read/icp-has-announced-their-plans-to-sue-the-fbi<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Every year, the FBI releases its National Gang Threat Assessment List, which examines &quot;emerging gang trends and threats posed by criminal gangs and communities throughout the United States.&quot; In 2011, Juggalos were added to the list. You already know about Juggalos, those zany, slap-happy, face-painted faygo-swillers who have made the Insane Clown Posse their religion. Well, now they&#039;re all members of a criminal gang, and Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope from ICP are gang leaders.<br /><br />Well, ICP is about to start fighting back, and they&#039;re reacting by suing the FBI. Let me say that again and make it clearer. Insane Clown Posse is suing the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <br /><br />Last night, I was chilling with Joseph Bruce, AKA Violent J of ICP, in his bus at the 13th annual Gathering Of The Juggalos (I&#039;m so happy I get to write that—thanks, VICE!). He told me that &quot;ICP is going to do something huge for our fans, and the world. We&#039;re suing the FBI to be taken off their list. They&#039;re trying to kill our band, and we have to fight back.&quot;<br /><br />In the weeks leading up to this year&#039;s Gathering of the Juggalos, ICP&#039;s attorneys warned that &quot;there&#039;s no telling what&#039;s gonna happen at the Gathering this year. This is the first time we had the festival now that we&#039;re a &#039;gang.&#039; According to the FBI, we&#039;re all at a gang rally, and our merchandise is gang apparel.&quot;<br /><br />Although currently only considered a gang in four states, law enforcement in 21 states have identified and logged criminal Juggalo subsets. In those states, if an ICP fan is on probation, and he or she wears an ICP hat to a parole meeting, that&#039;s a violation of probation for wearing gang apparel.<br /><br />&quot;Let&#039;s get this straight,&quot; he continued, &quot;a Juggalo is not a gang member. Consider a Juggalo that, 15 years ago, got a hatchet man tattoo or something. Now they&#039;ve got a family, they&#039;re working in real estate or something, and they&#039;re driving home and get a speeding ticket. Next thing you know, he&#039;s in the gang file, and that will be taken into consideration in any trial. Suddenly, it ain&#039;t just somebody who fucked up, it&#039;s a gang member who fucked up, and they&#039;re getting a heavier sentence.&quot;<br /><br />Violent J explained how the FBI&#039;s ruling has affected ICP&#039;s business in a major way: &quot;When we made that list, stores like Hot Topic stopped carrying our shit because they don&#039;t want to be selling gang apparel.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;This lawsuit isn&#039;t just for the fans. It&#039;s also for the good people who work at Psychopathic Records. There are 30 employees. Some of these people started off when we were 18 years old, but now some of them have been working here for 20 years. That&#039;s their career now. They have kids, and wives, and husbands. Next thing you know, they&#039;re working for a gang.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://juggalosfightback.com/

Even if they are honest about these spiritual messages, it still doesn&#039;t make their music good. Sure, they had some nice beats, especially in their older stuff (CD with the wraith thing on it), but their vocals and lyrics are just downright fucking retarded. They make today&#039;s underground rappers--who think they are leading a revolution against the &quot;NWO&quot; because they watch conspiracy shows on the History Channel--sound like gangsta rapping Carl Sagans. I&#039;m surprised the FCC didn&#039;t ban their shit after incorrectly assuming it was marketed to 4 year olds. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the average scrub living in iowa.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s a shame these &quot;scrubs&quot; don&#039;t realize that taking the juggalo scene too seriously makes them look retarded. If they do realize how stupid it makes them look and continue buying into this stuff, that&#039;s just sad. No one cares if you dress up like a clown and go fuck around at an ICP festival, just don&#039;t bring that shit into the public scene and expect people to tolerate it. 29 year olds running around a shopping mall screaming, while dressed like clowns of course, are the ones who make their music look bad. <br /><br />They aren&#039;t the first group to hide messages in their songs, but as far as I know, they are one of the only ones to preach all this enlightened spiritual shit while at the same time encouraging people to be low class and stupid.

It&#039;s possible that they act moronic by day and meditate into the 5th dimension at night, just to show us all how acting like an asshole doesn&#039;t make someone... i dunno, i ran out of ideas here.

Personally, I just don&#039;t like how their music sounds. I get a lot of the same message from Shpongle and other artists. Not to mention life... it is everywhere. But of course it&#039;s awesome in the form of music and parties.

				^^This. <br /><br />I may not like their music very much and I think SOME juggalos behave like idiots public and shouldn&#039;t be surprised to be mocked...But, I still believe in their right to listen to whatever they want and go out to concerts and have fun. The majority of them are harmless, and those that aren&#039;t can be dealt individually. The feds are stooping even lower than ICP lyrics by adding fans of a music group to their list of gangs. Still, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as serious as they say it is, and TBH, this is awesome publicity for them. Thanks to the FBI, ICP is now the most dangerous band in America. Neo Nazis better watch out!

				Wow... That is far from the ICP I remember. I remember when they wore dark looking FUBU clothes and rapped about, smoking weed, killing cops, and screwing trailer trash whores. Now it seems like they are trying out for a children&#039;s educational video for a youth Christian camp.

				If there was a gang that called themselves The Grateful Dead it didn&#039;t have anything to do with the actual band. They might of been fans or something. A lot of the Motorcycle Gangs were into the hippie movement back then or hired to do security for shows, but they weren&#039;t part of the hippies do to their violence everyone just feared them, so nobody said anything. Hippies were mainly college kids, dropouts, draft dodgers, and war vets who got high and hated the government. <br /><br />
