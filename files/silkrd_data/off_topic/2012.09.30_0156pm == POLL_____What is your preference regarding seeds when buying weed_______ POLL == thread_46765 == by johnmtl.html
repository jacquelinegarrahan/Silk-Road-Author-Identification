				We used to get juicy fruit from canada for 400 a qp. This was only a few years ago and it was descent weed, it was straight commercial but it was good to sale in the states before people learned about quality weed. Those were the days...<br /><br />To answer the poll, as a grower seeds are unacceptable to me unless you&#039;re breeding.<br /><br />

				If the weed is cheap, like $50-70 an oz then I&#039;m totally fine with seeds since I&#039;ll be cooking with that weed anyway. For more standard weed at around $200 an oz there better not be any seeds or that&#039;s the end of my business relationship with the vendor.

				Seeds in my bud raise the question: Even if this bud is potent and seeded, how much better could it have been grown to its potential?<br />I know people excited when they find a bagseed, it is something to grow. For me it always makes me suspicious no matter how good the bud.

				For high end weed, its unacceptable. Cheap weed, well its cheap for a reason. I dont care how potent or well grown it is, if it has seeds, its mids..&nbsp; <br /><br />Lets say mex brick is 100/oz, and tip top shelf is 400. The brick is gonna be seedy, and the seeds are going to vary from a lot to a whole lot. (I picked up some reggie the other day and had forgot just how annoying it is to sift out seed!)<br /><br />Mids that are 200/oz, the seed count better be pretty light, and potency must be good to cover seed weight.<br /><br />Anything over 250/oz, better not have seeds.&nbsp; I always have my dudes report back to me on seed discovery. Sometimes they find a few per oz, when I&#039;m selling it as sensi.&nbsp; It upsets me to be honest, and I catch flack for selling sub par &#039;nugget&#039;. Just because indoor growers should have things down pat by now, its freakin 2012!

Earlier I said i would only smoke sensi but, I was being short sighted. When in Jamaica the seeded weed is so cheep, you can get half a pound for 100-200 bucks USD. Finding Sensi can be difficult and the seeded stuff is so easy to get, i can deal with picking out the beans.

				I don&#039;t mind seeds.&nbsp; Hell, if you smoke weed and you haven&#039;t seen seeds you haven&#039;t been smoking long enough.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; seeds should NEVER count as the bulk of the weight.

				I dont buy it but if its cheap and does the trick i would smoke it no problem, you can toss the seeds out after you&#039;ve your bud ground up, their some rank tasting fuckers through the bong though!
