				So I&#039;m planning on baking a weed cake with some friends tomorrow, only have chocolate cake mix so I&#039;m fine with it. But I have never done this before and would like instructions/tips from people on here with experience in this and the best way to do it along with some info of how long the smell would stay in the house and will it ruin my pan/leave an odor when melting the butter with the weed. Buying a quarter for this and help is appreciated :D

				don&#039;t burn the butter and there aint no stank.<br /><br />keep the weed away from fire, strain the butter before you make the cake.<br /><br />even if you leave the weed in the butter, you shouldnt dank up the house. we made enough weed brownies to know there&#039;s not really any smell.<br /><br />and the taste of weed in your food depends on the strain you use. some taste better than others. some taste kinda like mild mint with oregano fragrance, others are kinda nauseating :s<br /><br />tl;dr: it&#039;s easy... as shit.

				So basically the only process I have to worry about is the butter and then just follow through with the instructions on the box? How long should I have the weed and butter cooking on low heat so I can be assured the THC is extracted enough?

				Yup just cook the weed in the butter.&nbsp; Break up the weed really fine first. melt the butter and add the weed.&nbsp; Keeping it on LOW heat is extremely important so you don&#039;t burn the weed and lose the THC.&nbsp; The longer you cook it the more THC you extract but a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour should be used. I&#039;ve seen people say they cook it for 2-4 hours before.<br /><br />Also I&#039;m not sure about the previous posts.&nbsp; When I cook cannabutter it really stinks up the whole kitchen so I wouldn&#039;t bank on it being odorless.<br /><br />Once you&#039;re done cooking it you have two options.&nbsp; To strain the weed out using the cheesecloth or leave it in.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done both with equally good results but only left it in when I broke it up so much it was more of a weed powder when I cooked it so you didn&#039;t break a tooth on a stem or something.<br /><br />After this just cook the cake as normal using the butter.&nbsp; Just make sure to look how much butter the cake mix requires and use that amount to cook the weed in.

Or mix it into chocolate pudding. <br /><br />What I do is make 2 chocolate cakes each in a 9inch baking pan, on one of the cakes use a spoon (while it&#039;s warm) to scoop out the cake 1-2 inches from the edge, all around, making a crater in the middle of the cake (but not scooping so low that there isn&#039;t a bottom).<br /><br />Then fill the crater with chocolate pudding, the kind in a can from the baking section. Put the other cake on top of it and I like to use cream cheese icing all around that, slice up strawberries and put them on top and use a cheese grater on a chocolate bar to get those curly chocolate shavings of deliciousness on top too.

				If your making the cake I have above, with pudding, then what you do is heat up vegetable oil, mix in your weed (grind it up as much as possible). Then I mix the pudding in with the vegetable oil and stir, after it&#039;s stirred well let it cool a bit and taste it, if it tastes good your fine, if not then I add more pudding and/or condensed milk and heat it up again stirring. Doing it this way your not really heating the weed, so you don&#039;t have to worry about losing any thc, if you reheat after the weed is added make sure it&#039;s on very low heat.

				I will be using deadfutures example first since it&#039;s the simplest haha but will try that pudding way next time. The box doesn&#039;t say anything about using butter with it, just eggs, water, and vegetable oil. Should I take the oil out and replace it with butter or just put everything together?

				You&#039;re welcome, have fun!&nbsp; Just remember eating it is different than smoking.&nbsp; It can take up to an hour and half to kick in so sometimes people eat way more than they should without realizing it and end up hugging a pillow for the next 6 hours.&nbsp; So calculate your slices so that everyone ends up eating around 1-1.5 grams of weed at first depending on each persons tolerance.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also seen smaller girls (100lb or so) get absolutely wrecked after eating 1/2 a gram.&nbsp; Just remember that you can always eat more!
