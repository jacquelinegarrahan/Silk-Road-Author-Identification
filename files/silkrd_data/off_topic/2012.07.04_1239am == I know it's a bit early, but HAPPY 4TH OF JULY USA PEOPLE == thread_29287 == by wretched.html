				And to take the food discussion a bit further, from what I can tell (having never been there myself) wild variety s available in even the smallest villages in the U.K. I can&#039;t go to a butcher and order suet or tripe without an advance call, but I have been told that veal heads are available in butcher shops across the country. I live in a relatively diverse area, but the butcher shops here are assembly line, minimum wage workers, while it seems that butcher shops in your home area are careers that people choose to build their craft, I respect that. It seems where I live , that more and more, people don&#039;t want to build a career anymore (unless it is a corporate one), and the artisan has, by in large, gone the way of the dodo bird.<br /><br /><br />Long story short, the U.K. is on my eventual food tour list!

Christian rock, Muslim rock, Buddhist rock, Hindi rocks, Satanist rock (AKA just rock), they all deserve to make the tunes that they think bring them closer to their god, and who are we to judge, because one of them might even be right.&nbsp; I wonder what a Buddhist mosh pit looks like, btw.
