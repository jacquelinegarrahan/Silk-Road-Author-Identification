				I was hoping to get some advise from experienced users that have tried both acid and shrooms.&nbsp; I have only done acid once as a candy flip years ago.&nbsp; I am looking for some new experiences other than e and I am unsure of which route to go.&nbsp; Can someone give me some idea of what to expect on each like the length of time I could expect to trip and the amounts of each I would need to do?&nbsp; Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond.

				amount for a proper trip:<br />acid- 1.5-2.5 strong tabs (usualy in the 100-150ug range)<br />shrooms- 2.5-3.5 totaly dried grams. 30-35 fresh.<br /><br />duration: <br />acid: comes up within an hour, lasts about 8-12 hours. you peak at around 3-4 hour mark. then for me it comes in waves. starts with a real pyschadelic mental head space and then you seem to &#039;earn&#039; the most beautiful fluid visuals by the end. <br /><br />shrooms: havnt done in a good while, comes up in around an hour aswell? from memory. far shorter duration maybe 4-6 hours? different aspect visualy- less fluid visuals more distortion. head space is more head fucky for me, for lack of a better word. less motor control and the like than acid.<br /><br />acid- deeper thoughts and concepts. more intrinsic visuals. head trip much more challenging but rewarding. <br />shrooms- deeper head fuck, visuals are less constant- distort more and have their own distinct characteristics. <br /><br />overall- i choose acid over shrooms. all down to the situation though and personal preference. Also, people react differently to the same drugs, so just try both and decide. both are worth it.

				Acid: Around 10 hours total I&#039;d say. Peak is 4-5&nbsp; hours or so. Acid is more of a rational trip I&#039;d say. The headspace is clear, and you can think and function better than shrooms. 2 tabs would be great. (Around $20)<br /><br />Shrooms: Around 8 hours. Peak is 3 hours or so. It&#039;s more...confusing, and can be a difficult headspace. You&#039;re more likely to be couch-locked, and less in control. 2.5g-3.5g.($25)<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Acid lasts longer, and you are more in control and less likely to have a bad trip, but if you do it lasts awhile if you are not good at getting rid of them.<br />Shrooms are shorter, more expensive, and don&#039;t last as long, but some people consider them more spiritual and say you take more away from the trip.

				I second the acid. I&#039;ve done both multiple times and I prefer acid over mushrooms. <br /><br />But you only live once so try them both, just remember it&#039;s all about set and setting.

				Thanks for the replies.&nbsp; I think that made it pretty clear for me.&nbsp; I will try acid first and then experiment with shrooms later.

				For me the trips on both only last a few hours even when I take alot. I have had good shrooms and good acid. Both are good in different ways but I prefer acid for several reasons. The main advantage to acid is that its easier to hide since it takes up less space plus in my area shrooms grow everywhere and acid is rare. Second, shrooms taste like shit, its much easier to eat a few tabs than shrooms. Last, acid gives me more visuals while shrooms give me more of a mind fuck.

				I&#039;m definitely more interested than the visuals right now than a mind fuck.&nbsp; Baby steps I guess&nbsp; ;D

				Acid has more visuals and it is easier to consume than nasty as fuck shrooms.

				Shit...guess im well in the minority here lol&nbsp; :-X I was going to say shrooms everytime for me but both acid and shrooms should be tried to see which one you prefer,everyone&#039;s different.<br />Shrooms were the 1st i tried,just a few small Liberty Caps freshly picked,a lot of laughing,slight visuals etc but nothing major,a few months later we went hardcore and took about 200 each that were about 5 times the size of the others,that was something major lol.<br /><br />Started working after 30 mins but maybe hour an half before hit proper,massive mind screwing visuals that turned everyone we saw into giants,but whenever you tried to focus they morphed into something else.Colours shooting out of everywhere,faces in the clouds,didn&#039;t feel like i belonged in my body,all usual stuff lol.Lasted about 5-6 hours which was long enough tbh then slow come down for 2 hours.<br />Acid was similar,way easier to take obviously but lasts for a lot longer,maybe twice as long,which if it&#039;s ur first trip may be WAY to long lol,i also found acid a harder come down but maybe that&#039;s just me?<br />If you know a place to pick shrooms then try the shrooms,a lot of people will say their a more spiritual,expressive,enlightening trip being natural an all but just make sure u try the acid as well,just not the same time :o<br />BTW,lots of different kinds of shrooms,different strengths,effects etc but shrooms and acid are a whole different ball game than E&#039;s...MDMA,whatever u do don&#039;t take them with someone who you think may screw with ur head cos believe me you won&#039;t need it lol,best friend,girlfriend etc and probably somewhere like a forest etc,not in the middle of your city shopping centre at rush hour.<br />Have fun but be safe..<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />meme?<br /><br />

				Always feel shrooms as life changing experience. Not sure about acid though, whether it will change the way you think.
