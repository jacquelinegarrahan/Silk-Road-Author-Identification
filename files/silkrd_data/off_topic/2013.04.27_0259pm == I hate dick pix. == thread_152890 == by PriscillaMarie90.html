				I wanted to ask a question to the men and women of The Road, why on earth do men think women like to see pictures of their dick? Does anyone out there really like dick pics? Like, women send nude photos because our bodies are beautiful. A woman&#039;s body can be so divine, I have never been sexually interested in women but even I can appreciate a tasteful nude photo of a woman. However, when I see a photo sent from my sexting buddy I cringe, because I know I&#039;m about to open a MMS with a cropped photo of his schlong and I just think &quot;why?&quot;. Maybe I&#039;m just prude or something, I don&#039;t know, and it&#039;s not like dick pics OFFEND me or anything, I just don&#039;t really get the point. Seeing your dick doesn&#039;t make me horny, 10 of 10 times my reaction is laughter. I just thought this would be a funny topic and I want to know what the rest of you think!<br /><br />xoxo<br />PM90

				Dick&#039;s Picks volume 20 has a super chill St. Stephen. It doesn&#039;t go to any wild places like 6/26/1977, but all the right feels are there. <br /><br />Wasn&#039;t TrashBox awarding the best dicks with giveaways? I wholeheartedly agree that penises are hilarious, but my girlfriend too enjoys the occasional hard-on photo. Maybe she&#039;s just racking up blackmail for when she plans to split, though.

After all, we&#039;re the ones that take them, right?<br /><br />See, it&#039;s ingrained in men from a young age that &quot;size matters&quot; (mostly instilled in us by our peers during puberty). For a 9-12 year old boy, there are a lot of myths surrounding the growth, and average size of our little member. And we suck it all up. I mean, no one wants to be last picked for the dodge-ball team, right? Same thing applies here. Boys poke fun of boys, belittling them(pun intended) in order to make themselves feel better. This leads to two things: Insecure men(the victims) and over-confident men(the bullies). Either way, the &quot;average&quot; size of a penis does not change. Just the attitude around it.<br /><br />Furthermore, just as this is true for young boys it is true for girls. The difference is, a girl can outright SEE her competition. You can &quot;make fun&quot; of another girl for being &quot;flat chested&quot; if you&#039;re rocking a large C when you&#039;re in the 7th grade. It happens ever day. And when those girls grow-up, do they take a lot of upper-torso/cleavage pictures? Absolutely. So, why wouldn&#039;t guys take pictures of their penises based on the same psychology? <br /><br />The answer to your question is that most men are either insecure, or over-confident. The insecure ones are going to want to show you their dick, to &quot;prove&quot; themselves &quot;worthy&quot; ... and the over-confident ones are going to want to &quot;show off&quot; what they preceive to be &quot;a monster&quot; ...<br /><br />At the end of the day, 70% of men forget that the real way to a woman&#039;s pussy, is her laughter, her intellect, and maybe just a little social lubricant(drugs/alcohol). Not a still frame of their ugly penis. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> +1 Festivalia, in my honest opinion you&#039;ve hit the nail on the head and I couldn&#039;t agree with you more :)

				I&#039;ve known several girls who like to look at dick pics. The blanket statement that NO women enjoy them is a little short-sighted and basically not true. It may not be your thing, but there is definitely a &quot;market&quot; for it. I mean, there was a dick pic contest on these forums for christ&#039;s sake. <br /><br />I understand where you&#039;re coming from, though. Like AllDayLong said, a &quot;pussy pic&quot; rarely does anything for me. And I certainly won&#039;t argue with your points about a woman&#039;s body. :D

				I&#039;ve sent out many a dick pic in my day. Here is my thesis on the dick pic. <br /><br />There are only a few types of women who likes the dick pic: <br /><br />1. Nymphos: the type who needs to blow you while you do homework, or while you drive, and needs to masturbate twice a day, will probably lick drugs off your asshole, etc. (send many dick pics)<br /><br />2. Gay men pretending to be women in order to see your meat. (you probably sent dick pics and now a guy wants to blow you behind a Denny&#039;s. This should be avoided if you aren&#039;t a homosexual. If you are a homosexual, then you have succeeded.)<br /><br />3. Craigslist women. (Send all the dick pics)<br /><br />Then there are the people who don&#039;t like the dick pic. They include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />You DO NOT send the dick pic to these people:<br /><br />1. Immediate family members.<br />2. Platonic friends you want to sleep with, and decide to send them a dick pic at 2 a.m hoping to seal the deal. <br />3. Friends of your current girlfriend.<br />4. Your counselor, probation worker, clergyman, judge, etc.<br />5. Minors and miners. (think sooty old dudes with canaries and flashlight hats trying to see your meat) <br /><br />And please make sure not to leave the dick pic in a place where a neutral party, such as a friend can stumble upon it. I fix computers on occasion, and I&#039;m really tired of seeing random dick pics in the downloads and pictures folders.. <br /><br />This has been a guide to dick pic etiquette by BruceCampbell. <br />

				I like dick pics. I&#039;ve asked for them a few times (and not just for that TSC contest) I&#039;ve asked IRL guys who I potentially want to sleep with 8) Dicks are intimidating, I like to prepare myself. Sometimes I laugh and sometimes I cry... but usually I just smile and think about how good it would feel inside me. <br /><br />But what I reallllyyyyyy like is when I get an unsolicited pic with a message like &quot;I got so hard thinking about last night and your pussy dripping all over me&quot; :P Forget cash, if you get a boner the next day thinking about me then I WANT PROOF. yummy proof.

				I&#039;m less intelligent because I said your girlfriend sounds lame?&nbsp; She&#039;s saying that all men who like anal sex are gay, or bi-sexual.&nbsp; That is the most unfounded and profoundly stupid thing your girlfriend has probably ever said, and you came here to tell us about it.&nbsp; How does it make me less intelligent for calling out your idiot girlfriend?<br /><br />Let&#039;s use another example, equally as dumb, less related to man-butt.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you opened up with, &quot;My girlfriend told me that all men who don&#039;t eat pussy are gay.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would reply, telling you that your girlfriend&#039;s pussy probably smells like fish, and that&#039;s why she thinks that.&nbsp; Is it making sense now?&nbsp; Your girlfriend has an aversion to having something shoved up her ass.&nbsp; You said it yourself, she knows what she likes.&nbsp; She also knows what she doesn&#039;t --anal sex.&nbsp; And then she told you that &quot;all men who like anal sex are gay&quot; so you wouldn&#039;t try to stick it in her butt.&nbsp; You must be a complete fucking tool who does whatever his woman wants, despite himself.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp; Or you would have told her that was a really dumb excuse.&nbsp; If a girl doesn&#039;t like it in the butt, I&#039;d never know.&nbsp; I don&#039;t actively pursue ass-fucking.&nbsp; However, also as stated, I&#039;ve met quite a few girls who love getting fucked in the ass.<br /><br />Does it make me gay to oblige?&nbsp; Absolutely not.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially considering these very same girls probably make yours look like Honey Boo Boo&#039;s mom.

				Has anyone seen that new obnoxious fast food commercial with the two chicks sitting there talking about something being big and then the one chick tells her to &quot;tell me him to send a pic!&quot; and then its this stupid picture of a burger.<br /><br />Man I hate that commercial.<br /><br />That&#039;s all this thread reminds me of.&nbsp; That and anthony wiener.&nbsp; I dont think I actually know anyone in real life who sends or receives dick pix.

Does anyone out there really like dick pics? Like, women send nude photos because our bodies are beautiful. A woman&#039;s body can be so divine, I have never been sexually interested in women but even I can appreciate a tasteful nude photo of a woman. However, when I see a photo sent from my sexting buddy I cringe, because I know I&#039;m about to open a MMS with a cropped photo of his schlong and I just think &quot;why?&quot;. Maybe I&#039;m just prude or something, I don&#039;t know, and it&#039;s not like dick pics OFFEND me or anything, I just don&#039;t really get the point. Seeing your dick doesn&#039;t make me horny, 10 of 10 times my reaction is laughter. I just thought this would be a funny topic and I want to know what the rest of you think!<br /><br />xoxo<br />PM90<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s the point. Excessive laughter leads to horniness. You won&#039;t fee horny if you have frequeny bang. Try abstaining for a month and look at the dick pix again.
