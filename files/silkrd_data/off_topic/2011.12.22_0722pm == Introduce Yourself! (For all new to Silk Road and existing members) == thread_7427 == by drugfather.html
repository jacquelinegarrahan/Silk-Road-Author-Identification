				Hi everyone. I am drugfather or &quot;DF&quot; for short. I&#039;m fairly new to the site but as a member I have exponentially grown. I am always on the lookout for ways to improve the site. I try to befriend reputable vendors and Silk Road (SR) staff to where I can make an impact to improve the SR system and community. I&#039;m currently a freelance coder/designer with a degree in organic chemistry and pharmacology. I&#039;m fairly young and I&#039;d like to go back to school to extend my pharmacology degree to a Ph.D. At that point, I could be pretty successful at the two things I love the most: drugs and the chemistry of drugs. I&#039;m an opiate lover with good self control so I&#039;m lucky I haven&#039;t become an addict (yet) :p My #1 love will always be Mary J. I&#039;m here for any chemistry/design/webcoding help if needed. Just shoot me a PM.<br /><br />Well. That about wraps it up for me.<br /><br />-DF<br />drugfather

				Hi, my name is lmfao and I like to play video games online like MMORPGs. I live with my friend Sora and sometimes she plays the games with me too, but I usually play more than she does. I consult for a company, but I&#039;m practically employed there as I&#039;ve been working for them for about 6 years now. I graduated from University in 2001 with studies in physics. I&#039;m currently looking to work on my postgraduate degrees overseas, possibly in America. If I ever move to America, I&#039;d like to start a family with Sora. We&#039;ve already decided on names for a boy or girl! (Or both. Haha)

				Greetings...(cough, cough) my name is oppyate and I am an Oppi-Holic. Arrived on SR as result of Hawker Blog on SR. Was really getting Ripped-Off by On-Line Pharmacies to tune of over $1500, India, Cameroon and Canada. al scams, BUT, I kept beleiving there was a &quot;Source&quot; out there somewhere that could be Trusted most of the time, where there would be Good Customer Service, Honesty, Manners and Integrity. SR thus far has been that and more. The Forums and exchanges with Buyer and Vendors give you a pulse..an Indirect knowledge of Buyers and Vendors. Good, Bad or Indifferent.<br /><br />In a few months this place will be One Year Old, it&#039;s up to those that really care about SR to &quot;do the right thing.&quot;<br /><br />oppyate

				Looks like we&#039;re sharing careers. I&#039;m a stock broker. Been at it for couple of decades. Currency Trading is really more my thing. I pretty well knew in 2002 that Gold/Silver were going to go through roof. I especially like Trading start off companies. I think there&#039;s a great deal of opportunity in Trading the Bitcoin becuae of it&#039;s Volatility. I think SR has the opporunity to somehow go mainstream. I remember several large Investment Fir One of them was ms dumping money into dot.coms in the 90&#039;s. One. of them being Napster. Even though Napster was illegally downloading music the attention it was getting was of great interest to Traders. I think SR has that same opportunity. Thnx

				hi everyone!&nbsp; i&#039;m destiny and i discovered SR while chatting in a RC forum.&nbsp; i didn&#039;t even believe the thing was for real until i read a very pro SR article online.&nbsp; i lurked on here and studied up for that last like 2 months and in the last 2 weeks have made my first purchases.&nbsp; i have had nothing but good luck so far on here and hope the streak continues.&nbsp; i seek out U.S. produced hash, MDMA, and desperately want some actual latex extracted opium.&nbsp; when a listing for it came up a few weeks ago (not sure if it was legit or not) i was so frustrated because my btc wouldn&#039;t be in fast enough.&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;m a victim of the drug war, which stole a good number of years from me and took away a well paying job because i possessed the wrong type of powdered chemical.&nbsp; <br />currently i work a rather menial job while finishing up a degree in IT.&nbsp; i&#039;m a rather wild girl but have a very strong rational side, i love technology and science.&nbsp; i currently have a wonderful partner (yes boys i prefer women, but consider myself pansexual) and she has been joining me on this exploration of the realm of the mind.&nbsp; it&#039;s been so fun watching her have her first roll, get giggly high, or enjoy some 4-FA with me.&nbsp; <br /><br />i have begun to really enjoy the forums here it&#039;s one of the few places i can speak freely about drug use without constantly using SWIM or creative writing to deflect culpability.&nbsp; everyone is very civil and lessons are learned from this ultimate experiment in a true free market.<br /><br />*destiny*

				I&#039;ll bump this since I noticed my previously attempted edit to my previous post didn&#039;t go through (and since it seems like a good thread worth +1ing)<br /><br />I came to SR to seek reliable sources of certain medicines and sacraments since my local market is interested more in a cheap high (usually with a low quality commercial grade product) than in serious introspection, or treatment of ailments.<br />top grade cannabis (particularly extracts), ibogaine, assorted (and especially exotic) phenethylamines and tryptamines, these are the things I came here to buy.<br /><br />I have a notoriously high tolerance and dosage threshold level to pretty much everything I&#039;ve ever tried, perhaps a quirk of my biology (I&#039;ve discussed this with those of my ancestors who are still alive and can recall their own psychonautic journeys), but at any rate if something effects me, there is a good chance it will effect the average user more heavily.<br /><br />I smoke the strongest smoke available daily.<br />I periodically explore the realm of entheogenic biochemistry.<br />I am a student of life eternal, and of the infinitely complex &#039;Verse, and of its Source should there be one.<br />

				Probably a little bit too late for introduction post, but here it is:<br /><br />I&#039;m early member on Silk Road. Registered but did not made any purchases, mainly because there was many important things going IRL. The Silk Road did not shock me as I&#039;m honored member of many amazing places, the Silk Road was just different. Almost too good to be true :D<br /><br />I&#039;m into computers and computer security. I can help other members with various questions in this topic, as well as physical security and so on. I have no formal education in this field, but self-learning and passionate interest is just as good.<br /><br />My favorite drug is alcohol. From time to time I enjoy mary J with my friends or some track of amphetamine. Also I take phenobarbital prescription mixtures if I can get them, they feel almost exactly like being drunk. But nothing removes the pain from my life as getting drunk and passing out.

				After few years travelling here and there. I started the normal life on my &quot;thirties&quot;. Now i got wife, kids a small bussiness. I really love heroin. I did use in the past heroin by fixing. I been hook on it in India and Thailand, Greece,&nbsp; Israel, Egypt, and Turkey . I think heroin by the needle is super plesurable, the more hook you are, the more pleasure you get from it. I remember when i wake up in India my first fix of indian white h in the morning, the following ones of the day not epic . Now i am afraid to loose control if i fix it. So i smoke it now. I love to smoke h, browns preferieble, but if is good h white too. All my body gets better when i have good h. My cells got a memory efect that when i take it they get 150% happier. I am not a compulsive user, somepeople get a gram and until they dont finish they dont stop taking. I keep under control with very strict personal rules. Like never buy during the working days in the week. I smoke fridays, saturdays and Sundays. If i got abundance, during the week i will have a smoke at night when i came from work before dinner, if i dont have h i have some morphine. Codeine, make me scratch a lot. I never try oxys i dont know if they are more like morphine i hate bad quality heroin i had been 13 years looking for a good dealer with a good product and everything is garbige or a scramble of many different compaunds lace it with heroin . I like opioids, but morphine for me is too boring is not as pleasurable like heroin. I dont drink alcohol, i dont smoke grass or haschis anymore it make me paranoid. I dont take or like relaxing pills, or benzos.&nbsp; &nbsp;I like to eat opium ocassionaly when i get it very rarerly lately. I colection books about drugs and drugs and pharmaceutical parafernalia. I am very very interested in trying dmt or ibogaine. I am looking for experiencing a psicodelic drug to do it now and them. I know i need some guidance, i will like to hear from and opioid user that is in methadone maintenance, that use dmt . Is been 15 years that i dont use l.s.d., maybe 14 that i dont use mmda or mda.&nbsp; I am in a methadone maintennance know for 10 years know with a medium dose of 75mg/day. I hate the stigma associated with drug users. It piss me off a lot, that you can get benzos and tranquilizers prescribe so easy, Prozac, mixed with alcohol, and to get prescribe opioids&nbsp; i been 10 years seeing a doctor 2 times a month. Signing every freaking day in the Pharmacy. Hiding so my neighbourgs dont see me everyday in the pharmacy drinking the stupid methadone (that by the way dont give me any pleasure) I found this place and i realize i was looking for it without knowing that existed. I think that is going to improve my live a lot. I hope so.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m SuperDimitri. I was drawn here through RS article. Was very hesitant, and still kinda am. I have only placed 2 orders, over a week ago, and am still waiting on arrival. <br />I originally had high hopes of selling, but soon realized it wasn&#039;t going to be all humdrum, as it is at home, and so now have just been spending Xhours a day reading these goddamn forums. It really ISN&#039;T my thing to have to read a lot, I prefer to be outside hiking, snowboarding, etc. I am currently getting all the gear together that would make me a trusted seller, i.e: a TON of thick mm plastic, a vacuum sealer, bindles, etc. I have been shipping herb, scoobs, dose, &amp; dmt to my family in various states for years, but never took the care that I read about here.....AND....never experienced a single problem. Albeit, nothing that has to pass through customs. All intra-nation. <br />I someday hope to provide you with top quality indoor cannabis. Everyone brags about their weed,so I will just say top notch. At the time ofthis posting, the prevalent variety is the LemonSkunk/Haze that seems to be getting rave reviews on SR. Hash, when available. We have a nice bubble (bubble bag) hash right now. Ecuadorian scoobs, old school PF tek, then cased, and done indoors, or so I am told. And, of course, some super N, N-DMT. Extracted from MHRB using 99.9% pure NAOH, distilled water, &amp; Naphtha. Re-crystalized, so there is a variety of quality, ranging from shard/fish scale, pure white, off-white, little yellow, yellow. From personal experience, yellow to shard is a one hit difference. Yellow is just not so mellow on the lungs. <br />I was also thinking of providing DMT materials, such as MHRB powder.<br />In the meantime, you may see me post some questions, comments, etc, whilst browsing the forums. <br />And my offer from my very 1st post still stands: Happy to trade a ball of DMT for BTC, or the purchase of a seller&#039;s account for me. <br />Until next time, keep your vibrations high, and maybe Santa will bring you what you want next December! <br />Peace,<br />SD

Yellow is just not so mellow on the lungs. <br />I was also thinking of providing DMT materials, such as MHRB powder.<br />In the meantime, you may see me post some questions, comments, etc, whilst browsing the forums. <br />And my offer from my very 1st post still stands: Happy to trade a ball of DMT for BTC, or the purchase of a seller&#039;s account for me. <br />Until next time, keep your vibrations high, and maybe Santa will bring you what you want next December! <br />Peace,<br />SD<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Love snowboarding and glad to hear about the DMT welcome to SR :)<br /><br />-DF<br />drugfather

				Hi,<br />I&#039;m Lazy, <br /><br />I came due to curiousity and found that I love this place.<br /><br />I&#039;ve made a few orders, need to take a break already... quality has been GREAT, Vendors have been great to work with.<br /><br />Where I&#039;m from, regular vendors have this attitude.... kinda like &quot;I&#039;ve got the goods, I&#039;m in charge&quot; whereas here, vendors have treated me with the utmost respect. <br /><br />I was thinking about upgrading to a vendor account and offering some of my cannabis extracts, especially my &quot;Holy Anointing oil&quot; Just a bit nervous about it ;)<br /><br />~Lazy

				Hey everyone. :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been aware of Silk Road for a couple of months and a member for about a month. I&#039;ve so far only made one (small) purchase about three weeks ago which went really well and I plan to make my second in a few days.<br /><br />Outside of the internet I have a few contacts for weed but at most I find myself getting about 1.5g of hydro for £20. I also can get really shit MDMA for £40 a gram and really really really bad cocaine for £30 a gram (as good a price as that is, the stuff is terrible so it&#039;s not worth my money.) I&#039;ve got a dealer for LSD too but I&#039;ve never tried him yet and it&#039;s £15 a tab which is bloody expensive. I could get ecstasy pills, heroin and shrooms if I asked around but I&#039;ve never bothered. When I found out about Silk Road I was really high and it sounded like some underground resistance organisation in a book detailing a totalitarian future, the idea seemed really fucked up at the time though. As soon as I was sober I checked it out though and here I am.<br /><br />I only started using drugs in the past year or two and I currently smoke weed a couple of times a week either with friends or myself and really enjoy it. I also occasionally use cocaine and MDMA. I&#039;ve been experimenting with a lot of legal highs too recently some have been interesting, some not worked and one made me unable to achieve an erection when in bed with a really sexy blonde girl I&#039;d only dreamed of before. (Fuck it, I&#039;m anonymous, may as well share the moment when I really hated myself.&nbsp; ;D) I&#039;d like to start more on the real deal though and SR is my answer.<br /><br />I hope to become quite a frequent poster on these forums as in the year or two I&#039;ve been using drugs I&#039;ve become somewhat of a drug-freak, reading pretty much every interesting thing about all sorts of drugs the internet has to offer. So hopefully I can help some people out. I will also consider selling some stuff on here in the near future; I never plan to do it myself but I can get some brilliant heroin around here. But that&#039;s just a maybe.<br /><br />Looking forward to many positive experiences with SR in the future. :)

				Finally wandered into the Off topic section and found this thread!<br /><br />I&#039;m NW, and I&#039;ve been active on SR for a little over a month now. Like a lot of the newer members, Gawker introduced me to Tor and SR, and while I was interested back then, I figured there was way too much heat surrounding SR so I avoided signing up and forgot about it until a few months ago. My friends and I were looking to try shrooms but could not find any hooks, then I remembered about SR. I lurked and studied the forums and the marketplace, and eventually mustered the courage to make my first purchase, which actually ended up being domestic MDMA and not shrooms (though that was my second order).<br /><br />I believe there is no harm in dabbling, and that some drugs are unreasonably demonized. I have done pot, MDMA, and shrooms, and looking forward to trying LSD in the near future. Beyond those listed, that&#039;s about as far I am willing to tread.<br /><br />I am very glad a place like this exists, and I hope SR stays around for a long time.

				Hi there all you fun lovin people,<br /><br />First of all I&#039;m a recreational user of some drugs. I love to expand my view ;). I&#039;d like to share this with other people thats why I became a seller on the road.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard from silk road via via. It did took me a while to get it up and running (including updating my account to a seller account). What I do experience so far is very, very neat. I&#039;m really impressed by the feedback system, think that is really adequate. Also the listing of products is very good.<br /><br />I&#039;m aiming to be a trusted seller, I will make sure that I&#039;m gonna deserve that status. I will package the packages with a professional looking exterior. And of course gonna send the order as soon as I recieve the order. <br /><br />For a start I&#039;ve putten 2 products on silk road for a really good price. I&#039;ve put MDMA and ectasy pills for sale. Check it out on my profile: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/92468 <br /><br />For any questions just contact me on the road or send me a pm. <br /><br />Greets

It represents everything I think the internet should be. What we have here is a measure of freedom granted us by our peers to live as we will and follow our bliss.

				Hello all. DudeRugs reporting in..&nbsp; you may also call me &quot;the dude&quot; or just &quot;dude&quot;. I have been something of a psychonaut for the better part of 15 years and from my years of experience I have made many good-to-know connects and have positioned myself in a manner that allows me to get a wide array of wonderful mind-altering substances and very reasonable prices. Upon discovering the SR I realized that it was possible for this community to benefit from me, just as much I as I am able to benefit from the community. I have done every psychedelic that I have ever been able to obtain and currently have found amazing potential in a compound known as 25i-NBOMe. Anyone who enjoys LSD and/or MDMA I would encourage to try this amazing new psychedelic. I consider myself more of a traditional type drug user, in the sense that I am not overly interested in all of these different RCs that constantly come out. But 25i is one that really stands out. It feels very natural like mushrooms do, while giving the complexity of an LSD trip, but with the depth that you would expect from an intense mescaline journey, or even a DMT trip. I am happy to be able to offer this wonderful substance to this community for prices that are well below any other vendor. Obviously, should you want to try this amazing drug feel free to check out my listings or PM me for info but this isn&#039;t a sales pitch.. should you have the chance to try it I implore you to, whether I am the one supplying it or not. <br /><br />Sorry for the rant, I have just been having a great time since discovering the NBOMe&#039;s. I also will be having various pills available for prices below all the competitors. I am not trying to start price wars and frankly it won&#039;t happen since with pills, supply is typically limited per month to the size of the prescription. Should you feel like checking my sellers page though, I have many prices listed for different pills that I come into possession of throughout the month. At the prices I list they do go somewhat quick, but I am happy to make them available for the prices that I list them at. <br /><br />Other than that, I am just happy to get to be a part of a place I believe to be revolutionary for the drug culture. SR is a convergence of technology, intelligent people, and what I feel is an instinctual pursuit of people merely trying to find a way to get the things they want to make them content and without harming ANYONE in the process. I feel as if LEOs really have no place here because due to the nature of the marketplace, there is zero possibility of violence, intimidation, or aggression. Gotta love the internet..

				Yo,im Max1259 on here and Macca1259&nbsp; on SilkRoad,don&#039;t know why i have 2 names,guess iv just always been an awkard twat,well so my girlfriend says,she actually calls me a lot more but im not hiring a hitman yet,PM if there&#039;s any out there though&nbsp; :D<br />Lucky enough to have been around here for at least 6 months and loved every minute of it,interesting chats,met some cool dudes and even though in my 34 years iv tried most drugs out there this place has enabled me to try a few more lol&nbsp; ;D And especially having always wanted to have some &#039;PROPER&#039; Coke iv eventually been getting it from here instead of the 8% pure shitte that passes for Charlie in the UK-God bless SR for eventualy letting me get decent stuff.<br />And also it&#039;s a first for mevgetting H that i dont have to add citric to it.<br />Always been an experimental guy with mind altering substances,was there when the original E&#039;s hit the UK late 80&#039;s early 90&#039;s,was picking shrooms before that,for 8 years i had a blast trying,taking,selling just about everything and was lucky enough not to get stung,so thank God or whoever.<br />My only gripe at present is this pressure to finalize early,the most respected buyers dont ask so that&#039;s good and the thing is if iv ordered before and im happy then i will finalize early as a thank you,just dont like it as &#039;If you don&#039;t like,go somewhere else,you HAVE TO DO IT &#039;<br />Also wish i could get a cut price buyers account lol,just for the little guys lol.<br />Peace

				Hey!Hey!Hey!<br /><br />Im bosszozo.I am not going to say too much except that i love the SR website and the freedom it exhumes.The drugs i like are weed and hash but i do not smoke as often as i used to since i have responsibilities now.In my daily life i run an import export business with some white collar scams from time to time.Since discovering this site i feel that drugs might be a side hustle to consider just by viewing the demand on this site.<br /><br />If you are into import-export,white collar scams of all kinds in drugs feel free to pm me

				hey guys. I already made a few posts before I saw this thread so here&#039;s my fourth post introduction. <br /><br />I&#039;m jasonstatham here and jasonstathams on SR.&nbsp; I came here cause I love drugs and posted here cause I think I like the community.&nbsp; My DOC is opiates, any one I can get my grubby hands on. I&#039;m currently working on my degree in auto technology and hope to open up my own shop.&nbsp; Pharmacology is kinda a &quot;hobby&quot; of mine as I enjoy learning as much as I can about drugs.&nbsp; Other hobbies are video games, four-wheeling, dirt-biking, and fixing stuff.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hope to fit right in here and make some good connections.&nbsp; This seems like a great place and I am looking forward to getting to know you all!

I&#039;ve got pretty bad depression and anxiety so I self-med with drugs and making music. I&#039;m prescribed benzos, legally. I&#039;m gobsmacked at how clever and resourceful the people here are, and how diverse the community is.<br />

				I heard of this place quite a while ago and now finally bothered to find and join SR. I was always very involved at the internet, started early with warez (way before all that p2p crap) and some programming, kind of lost track of it lately, but still kept my interest up. Recently a lot of disturbing stuff about loosing anonymity in the internet started moving and I recalled a lot about TOR, Encryption and stuff. Some of it steered me into this direction.<br /><br />Anyways, I cannot believe what is going on here. I mean, I was expecting the drugs and experience sharing, but the whole community seems so awesome. I can feel that I seriously found a special place. I am glad to finally arrive here. Hopefully this will last a long time!

				Hello, My name is not Will, but we will go with that for the moment.&nbsp; I am brand new to SR. But how I do love that there is a site, that let&#039;s individuals decide what they can buy, without any restrictions.&nbsp; I applied for the customer service job fingers crossed, so I can quit my shitty pharmacy job.&nbsp; But until then I do have access to Sudafed...well the generic version so the same thing.&nbsp; I have seen someone selling a small amount for a large sum which is ridiculous.&nbsp; I have seen some digital stuff I would like to buy that hopefully will build up my credit around here, and then I might start selling, since I do get a wicked discount.&nbsp; Also, if you look gross, most pharmacies hid the sudafed and just lie to the junkies that come in there. So hooray for the inside track.&nbsp; Look forward to being a member of SR, whether official or not.<br /><br />Will

				Hey, I&#039;m hillis4070 and I heard about this site a few weeks ago and today found an article talking about how to get on it, so I decided to do so.&nbsp; I have a fairly limited understanding of security issues like encryption and using tor but I assume I&#039;ll learn as I go.<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually never been a huge drug person; I was paranoid as hell about using anything illegal (other than underage drinking) growing up because of my extremely religious parents.&nbsp; Tried pot once, and it didn&#039;t seem to have any effect.&nbsp; E wasn&#039;t around yet (during my high school/college days, anyway) and I didn&#039;t know anyone doing anything stronger than pot or the occasional tab of acid or mushrooms, so I basically just shrugged and got plastered instead of experimenting with anything harder.<br /><br />Fast forward to now, and I&#039;m a chronic pain patient, with unrelenting muscular pain of indeterminate origin throughout my back and hips, as well as frequent migraine type headaches.&nbsp; I don&#039;t live in a medical MJ state, and I&#039;ve been increasingly wondering if it might make some difference in my pain.&nbsp; Of course I don&#039;t know any one locally who uses, let alone deals, and suddenly an anonymous internet drug market seems like a pretty solid thing to me.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to spend some time researching various MJ strains specifically for pain benefits before I take the plunge and buy anything, and potentially look into backing up my opiate supply (since my doctor doesn&#039;t give me more than 30 Percoset at a time, I often find myself rationing them and not taking one despite being in a lot of pain).&nbsp; I&#039;m on Tramadol daily, but if MJ could do the job I&#039;d rather use something natural like that then a synthetic opiate agonist for daily pain control.<br /><br />Any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Best of luck to one and all.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m just your typical computer nerd and family man that likes to be able to let go of reality for a few hours every now and then. I found the road after moving to a new state I got tired of having to go though multiple people just to find one thing and then dealing with the markup it always gets. It is also nice to find things that I can&#039;t get a hold of easily and usually comes with a stiff price. While I&#039;ve mostly just been in it for the Molly and L, I must say with the weather changing and more chances to get out camping, I can&#039;t wait to get some shroomies which I swear has been like 4 years since I&#039;ve even heard of a guy that knows a guy who&#039;s third cousin works with a guy that MIGHT have some... Just a quick thanks to all those that help keep this site and forums up and running.

				yo<br /><br />I&#039;m a wasp from outer space.&nbsp; i walk the road between worlds.&nbsp; I&#039;m generally a good spirit, but I sting hard when provoked.&nbsp; I suppose, if pressed, I&#039;d have to say I&#039;m a neutral observer in this world.&nbsp; In the spirit world, however, I&#039;m a captain in the army of light, and trust me.....light is going to prevail over dark!<br /><br />Been looking for this place for a while; glad to finally be here.&nbsp; If you wire yourself into the net firmly enough, you can find anything :D<br /><br />I need weed: without it, I get hardened, dull, and unpleasant.&nbsp; this place is such a blessing, because as I&#039;ve gotten older my local connections for herb have faded to almost nothing.&nbsp; I also have always found it awkward to go to some guy&#039;s house and try to figure out how long is appropriate to stay and chat before I can leave.&nbsp; And I don&#039;t have a car, so I used to have my girlfriend drive me to the weed-man&#039;s house making the situation even MORE awkward.&nbsp; I&#039;m so glad that silk road has made those concerns a thing of the past<br /><br />I&#039;ve done a lot of psychedelics in my day.&nbsp; my thoughts and experiences on getting the most out of tripping:&nbsp; <br />So, our brains are a LOT like computers and there is indeed an internet for brains.&nbsp; When you use a high intensity/short acting psychedelic like DMT or Salvia extract its a bit like downloading a compressed file from the net: you can get a whole lot of info in a short amount of time BUT you have to decompress the file.&nbsp; to decompress a Salvia or DMT trip, you need acid.&nbsp; LSD is, hands-down, the best program I&#039;ve come across for this function.&nbsp; actually, i think acid is only good for deprogramming and decompressing...for anything else its basically useless.&nbsp; So, here&#039;s what you do to learn the secrets of life and the universe:<br /><br />1) Smoke a high intensity psychedelic<br />2) chill out for a week<br />3) clean your house/apartment/flat/whatever.<br />4) take a moderate to heavy dose of LSD in your home alone or with 1-3 other people.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt to have some MDMA on hand in case your trip turns ugly.&nbsp; (note:&nbsp; NEVER take mdma first...ALWAYS take the acid first)<br />5) sit or lay somewhere comfortable and try to spend the trip thinking about your high intensity psychedelic experience.<br />6) bask in the grand mysteries of life, humanity, and the universe as they are revealed unto you.<br /><br /><br />I very rarely use psychedelics anymore, however.&nbsp; Towards the end of my heavy usage I started to really lose it, mentally.&nbsp; I thought I had &quot;learned too much&quot; or had &quot;gone too far&quot; but I&#039;m learning now that I was a tad bit reckless and somehow let some evil djinn/demon/spirit/whatever into my headspace.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done a lot of work in the last few years toughening up my psyche, though, so now my astral avatar has transformed into a raging maniacal warrior.&nbsp; No one would believe how I accomplished this, and in truth I&#039;d be a little embarrassed to talk about it on a public forum, but PM me if you need help in this area and I&#039;ll share my secret with you.<br /><br />currently my favorite shit is doing a bunch of K while rolling on MDMA.&nbsp; I get wicked spaced out and can basically do whatever the hell I want:&nbsp; my imagination literally comes to life.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking about getting back into the psychedelics, though...kinda feeling the urge to trip out on a quarter of shrooms.<br /><br />so yeah, i&#039;ve been rambling, but this is kind of a stupid thread to exist on a forum like this.<br />good to be here.&nbsp; much love to you all.

				Hi All<br /><br />My name is penagihdadah from Malaysia. &#039;penagihdadah&#039; means &quot;junkie&quot; in the native language here. Im an animator/visual effects artist with a degree in film and animation. I prefer hallucinogens and my first drug was a self-extracted DMT (acacia confusa trees grows EVERYWHERE here lol). Im also a cannabis and acid aficionado.&nbsp; I came to know SR and tor in general via the notorious 4chan. <br /><br />Being involved in drugs in Malaysia is kinda sucky cos the tolerance here is extremely low. Its quite common to read news bout drug busts every week around here (mostly involves opiates, weed, MDMA and meth). Even carrying 200gm of weed cud get u a capital punishment by hanging, altho the LE here is equally corrupt if u have the connections and money. Weed is the most popular drug here, and usually involve foreigner cartels from the Middle East and Africa. Despite all that, classic hallucinogens like LSD, Psilocybin, Mescaline and DMT are almost unheard of in the media. <br /><br />Pleasure to meet you all. Keep up the good fight!

				Hello fellow SRians! My name is Aristotle Horatio Ignatius Dubois. I am a straight up opiate loving denizen of the Deep South, U.S.A.. I am going to open up a seller account in a few days or weeks and start supplying you guys with some methadone that doesn&#039;t have to make a month long ride (if it even comes) from the former Soviet republic. I&#039;m also going to have some Vic&#039;s and coke soon as well. I plan on making it extra special for those first few people who take the plunge and help me get a good rep on the site. As an agorist/libertarian anarchist, this place is a dream come true. If we all keep our wits about us and keep open these important lines of communication we can dodge the LEO&#039;s that don&#039;t know what the non-aggression principle is, and usurp the scammers that seem to have been having a field day as of late.

My first drug experience, besides caffeine, was Percocet and I&#039;ve been an opiate lover ever since. SR has allowed me to expand my horizons though, now I can happily say I&#039;ve dabbled in stims and psychedelics, both of which I&#039;ve liked my tastes of. I hope to expand even further on my psychedelic likes and dislikes, but because of some extenuating circumstances, that might be a while.<br /><br />I love the community here (a place where I DON&#039;T have to be ashamed of my drug use?! NO WAY.) and hope to continue to be a part of it.

				I know the original author asked for no real information, but my intention is to not be anonymous so as to increase credibility, and the flip side being of course that I&#039;m not going to be buying or selling any drugs. I hope that is OK. <br /><br />My name is John Humphreys, a 33 year old guy from Brisbane, Australia. My CV and more information that you want is available at my website: www.johnhumphreys.com.au<br /><br />I&#039;m currently doing my economics PhD at the University of Queensland, looking at non-profit personal personal equity financing of University in Cambodia. Basically, my thesis is about the Human Capital Project (www.humancapitalproject.com.au) which I set up back in 2007.<br /><br />As part of my thesis I will be looking at emergent market institutions... which basically means I&#039;ll be looking at why people respect private property and contracts, even when there is nobody to enforce the rules. Obviously, this is very relevant for SR since there is no government here, and yet the market exists and seems to be growing. <br /><br />So I intend to be running around the SR world looking for useable data on how effective this non-government market system is working. At some point I hope to conduct a survey of buyers and sellers asking about your experiences. If I&#039;m lucky, I might also get funding to run some experiments on SR, where I&#039;ll pay you to play some (fully legal) games.<br /><br />If anybody knows of any other similar research that has been done about Silk Road, I would love to hear about it. You can message me here, or e-mail me directly on john.humphreys99@gmail.com. Suffice to say, all individual correspondence will be kept in strict confidence (which is a requirement of my research)... and you&#039;re still anonymous so you&#039;re safe anyway.

				Hullo thar. I&#039;m new to the Silk Road community, but I&#039;ve known of its existence for a few months now. I didn&#039;t join because I was too busy being poor to feel like joining a community based on capitalism and drug use.<br /><br />That is no longer the case!<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;ve got some &quot;book&quot; knowledge regarding growing weed and mushrooms (re: some and book. I&#039;ve got no actual experience, sadly. Maybe in the future). I do not know much about other drugs, effects excluded of course. I&#039;ve never done drugs (not even alcohol) because I tend to be a fairly antisocial misanthropic dick. <br /><br />Well no, I tried weed three days ago. I&#039;m definitely going to be using it more.<br /><br />Right about now the only thing I&#039;m worried about here is my username, because right now I feel a tad crass when compared to other fellows. Ah well, c&#039;est la vie.

				Hey Silk Road!<br /><br />As a total noob to SR, I have a funny story as to how I found this place in the first place.<br /><br />I did not discover SR from the Gawker article, or the Senator Schumer outrage. I only learned that after I got here and did research.<br /><br />No, I got here completely by accident. I Googled &quot;Silk Road&quot; because I was working on a history assignment&nbsp; and doing research on the ancient trade link between Rome and China so I hit the Wikipedia link. Then I hit the &quot;disambiguation&quot; link and stumbled upon this awesome market place.<br /><br />True story!<br /><br />Three weeks later, I&#039;m hooked and about to make my first purchase.<br /><br />I believe in total freedom and adherence to the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;; that ancient Greek idea going back to 500BC.<br /><br />&quot;Do nothing to others that you would not like done to you.&quot;<br /><br />That should be the only basis for all law. As long as I do nothing to harm others, the &quot;law&quot; should have no business in my affairs. That is the very essence of individual freedom.<br /><br />The idea that &quot;the authorities&quot; can say what you can and what you cannot do with your own body is absurd. It is not the mark of a truly &#039;free society&#039;. If I hurt nobody (except myself) by imbibing substances deemed illegal then surely true freedom exists in my ability to make that choice for myself. Unfortunately, we live in a &quot;locked down world&quot;, a true sci fi dystopia, where the organs of the state deny us that ability through Draconian laws and seek to control our own choices in how we choose to live our lives.<br /><br />This is not freedom by any metric.<br /><br />&nbsp;In fact, the current world reality is that we are living in the opposite of a free society; in fact, a rigid slavery. <br /><br />If I cannot choose what I want to do with my own body and I hurt nobody except myself in the process and, take full responsibility for the choices I make, then I am not free.<br /><br />Some argue that using illicit substances is detrimental to society due to &quot;collateral damage&quot;. That is, idiots ending up in Emergency Rooms due to over doses and the idea that illegal substances lead to that more readily. I refute that argument just by casually looking at ER statistics and their admission rates. 60% of Emergency Room admissions on any given night are alcohol related, either through drunk drivers, domestic violence or overdose and that is a &quot;legal drug&quot;.<br /><br />The US Drug War has turned Mexico into a &#039;failed state&#039; on its southern border and resulted in the US having a greater prison population than Stalinist Russia and the highest number of citizens jailed for non violent crimes than at any time in the history of civilization.<br /><br /><br />Silk Road, from my perspective, is a great &quot;fuck you&quot; to those who seek to control us.<br /><br />I see Silk Road and the dark net in general as a means to circumvent the rules the stupid masses have imposed on the few who dare to dream.

				Hey guys!<br /><br />I&#039;m NotShadow. I&#039;ve been with SR since near infancy.. Myself, as well as one of my other friends were in search of a reliable source for drugs, and the more we thought about it the more we thought to the internet..And like God himself was providing the answer, I came across a few forums with the mention of &quot;the Road&quot; and the like. I had already known what the Onion was (I used it to bypass school filtering as a kid, but never imagined this purpose. Man if I could&#039;ve came up with the idea I&#039;d be rich! <br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;m an avid drug user and have tried most. They all sink my submarine for the most part:) I also have a lot of interest in computers, programming, organic chemistry, computer security and encryption, counterfeiting..Just about most subjects interest me:) I recently made it off probation, and can now smoke my MJ again, which is by far my drug of choice (maybe a tie with Methoxetamine). I also LOVE LOVE LOVE psychedelics, and AMAZING coke. and MDMA:) I&#039;ve never tried pure Methamphetamine, but every other form I have. It is a goal of mine to try it at least once. Currently its my personal goal to find an amazing MDMA substitute, and an Oxy substitute (I also &lt;3 me some Research Chems) :)<br /><br />I was once a new comer here and the community we have taught me very well:) So glad I found this community, it is simply amazing! Keep up the good work guys, we are the reason SR is still going!<br /><br />If I can help out, let me know! There a few situations I haven&#039;t been in, or seen on the SR so I can be helpful I&#039;m sure:)<br /><br />-NS

				I&#039;m The Romantic Era, or at least I am one who can get down with that movement&#039;s sentiments. I enjoy philosophy, particularly continental and existential branches, and wholeheartedly enjoy a book, movie, anime, or manga that can induce a mind fuck (part of the reason I like psychedelics so much, too :D) I also enjoy acquiring as much knowledge of my self and the human experience as well, humanly possible, and that is why I like drugs so much - they make me superhuman (or something XD). <br /><br />My drugs of choice are psychedelics, and I enjoy weed with everything, and smoke constantly (trying to cut back, recently...) I recently began experimenting with MXE, and it is and I hope will continue to help with my depression. <br /><br />I have read many introductions in this thread and it sounds like there are a lot of really interesting, smart, and generally &#039;cool&#039; people in this community. I am glad to become a part of it.

Radiohead is just all around amazing and some of those bass lines will get stuck in your head for days. Some advice: if you are trying to teach yourself, definitely get some books. There&#039;s tons of them out there. Any books by Hal Leonard are always quality. My first bass book was bass guitar for dummies and believe it or not it gave me a pretty good foundation to understanding the instrument. If you can afford it get a teacher because my skills and understanding really took off once I started lessons. There&#039;s also tons of lessons on youtube. But stick with it even when it seems you aren&#039;t progressing, practice, practice, practice. I know that&#039;s cliche, but it&#039;s true. The world needs more bassists.

That&#039;s awesome you have a musical foundation all ready. Things you think you forgot will come back to you if you just immerse yourself in learning to play. Especially with some background in piano, that will help a lot in learning bass concepts. Check out the bass line from quarantined by At the Drive In. I had my ipod on shuffle today and that song came on and I totally forgot how awesome that bass line is. And it&#039;s not very hard to learn once you get the timing down. Some more bass lines that are fun to play: Chic- Good Times, Arctic monkeys- florescent adolescent, Marvin Gaye- What&#039;s goin&#039; on, Beatles- A day in the life, Muse- Hysteria, Sublime- Santeria. Just to name a few. Happy jamming.&nbsp; ;D

				Hey, I love this idea! :)<br /><br />Hi guys, I&#039;m Opiophilia-- name says it all. I&#039;m an opiophile; I suffer from opiophilia. I love Opiates, with a passion. I&#039;ve been using opiates like oxycontin for five years, heroin for three. Heroin and I, we have a romantic relationship, see? ;) There&#039;s something beautiful about the whole process of filling my veins with this beautiful, destructive, euphoric oblivion. Did I mention I&#039;m an artist? I paint, play piano, and write poetry. So what opiates do for my artistic mind is just something inexplicable. Anyway, I study at a pretty good college. One of my friends is a computer science major, and occasional opiate user, and he told me about Silk Road. Let me just say, I am proud to be part of this revolution. It fills me with excitement to know that what we are doing can not be stopped (by anybody stronger than a U.S. Postal worker) :P Our wares should not be illegal, they should be available to all who want them, and this is what I love about SR. I hope it&#039;s around for years to come, and grows into a force to be reckoned with.<br />Anyway,&nbsp; I&#039;m a new buyer, but I&#039;ve already had several successful transactions with Top 25 Vendors. I look forward to sampling all of your Opiate products.<br />Peace, One Love&lt;3<br /><br />-Opiophilia

				Hi everyone! <br />I am so excited to be here but I am extremely inexperienced with all this! lots more learning to do before i make my 1st purchase!<br />My #1 love is opiates... my first was oxycontin, but i have since discovered opana and we have become pretty close! We don&#039;t hang out too much, because I have only 1 reliable source, to which i must drive 6 hours away! What a bummer! That&#039;s why Im hoping the Road can help me out! <br />I&#039;m really just a regular girl, with a regular job, nothing special. I attended college for 3 years but could never decide on a degree.. plus I just HATE school! I know one day, though, I will find my niche in life...<br />but for now I&#039;m just cruising along!<br />Nice to be here! I&#039;m excited to see a place like SilkRoad.. I&#039;m glad I can be with other experienced drug users and not need to hassle with liars and theives and LE... I hope I can bring something to the table!

I&#039;m actually really good with control also and that&#039;s helpful with that stuff.<br />I&#039;d love to become a seller on here sometime but not sure how that works yet. I think I could be good at the bitcoins MP trading but wouldn&#039;t wanna step on anyone&#039;s shop.<br />I got my first coins last night from BTC Buddy who i think is awesome and gave me a great deal! I would reccomend him to anyone. Unfortunately I seem to be just under most sellers prices for 1gm of coke and its depressing cuz im impatient &amp; my extra coins wont be coming for another week or so......soooo close yet so far lol<br />OK guess that&#039;s all for now...thanks for listening :-)<br /><br /><br />

				Greetings!<br />I&#039;m a country girl and recently moved to a much bigger city! I&#039;ts nice to be out of a small town but the busy city life is such a hassle sometimes! I&#039;m kind of a girly girl but I also love to put my boots on and go for a long 4-wheeler ride out in the woods. I&#039;m very artsy-fartsy, love to be creative, and I guess most people appreciate all my quirks!&nbsp; :-*&nbsp; My #1 love is opiates, preferably oxycodone and oxymorphone. Since moving I don&#039;t have any contacts at all, so I have taken quite a break, aside from every other month or so when I travel back to my home state. I&#039;m hoping with the Road I can partake without traveling so far and driving with substances in the car! I have some more learning to do before making a 1st purchase and I&#039;m excited to get started. Hopefully one day maybe I will have something to offer SR in return.<br />Nice to be here and meet everyone! <br />

My interests include but are not limited to yoga, meditation, reading, video games, live music, and spending time with my awesome puppy (oh and my awesome boyfriend too=P ) <br />I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship! <br />I may be interested in becoming a seller in the future...<br />I&#039;m completely not familiar with bitcoins..so I gotta do some research there first.<br />Cant wait for my tax returns so I can score! XD<br />

				Just posting to introduce myself to the community.&nbsp; I am a fan of all kinds of different mind-altering chemicals.&nbsp; I am tired of dealing with shady dealers who offer only a limited variety of products (usually only crack or heroin).&nbsp; I&#039;ve spent many hours studying up on pgp, bitcoins and the SR ordering processes.&nbsp; I think I have a good grasp on it now.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for my first purchase of ketamine and was wondering if anyone could refer me to a reputable dealer that will sell to a first time buyer.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone on Silk Road that have come before me to make this place possible.

				Almost everyone would sell to a first-timer unless they otherwise say so in their listing/profile.&nbsp; The only downside is that a lot of vendors make you finalize before they ship if you are new, so make sure you pick reputable vendors.&nbsp; What country are you located in?&nbsp; I find it best to order domestically (from within the same country).&nbsp; I&#039;m from the USA, but i&#039;ll also order from Canada.&nbsp; If you are comfortable ordering from Canada I would recommend looking up the vendor Tony76 in the search function within the main website.&nbsp; You can also browse his reviews here in the forums by searching him out as well.&nbsp; He sells all of the drugs I use and I (nor anyone else i&#039;ve ever seen) have had problems with him or the quality of his products.

				Best bet to research a vender is to simply search their name on the forums and you should get a bunch of threads. Be wary of ordering from people who don&#039;t seem to have any feedback. Also there are some drug specific threads where people discuss quality which might be worth a read (not sure if there is a K one off the top of my head but worth a look).

				Research the hell out of the vendors you choose to buy from. Do not assume anything unless you are thoroughly convinced the risk is worth the payoff. This is NOT Walmart, there is a risk assigned to everything you do here. Weigh your risks out accordingly and take every precaution necessary and you should do fine :-)

I don&#039;t judge them, they don&#039;t judge me, and we get along great.<br /><br />I am looking to learn as much as I can about drugs, business, and the business of drugs while I am here.<br /><br />Basically, like one other forum I frequent daily on the WWW, I just picked up another &quot;family&quot;!

Might as well ask though, is it really not as sketchy as it&#039;s made out to be?

Only recently in this short life have I begun to really experiment with Lucy, Molly, Shrooms, and DMT, as I&#039;d say I only messed around with them when I was younger. Although I&#039;ve been with Mary Jane half my life, what can I say other than we&#039;re in love. :)) Other than that I just like chilling with good friends in the park and learning about drugs, life, and happiness.<br /><br />I&#039;m not nearly clever enough to sell, but I am very interested in buying so long as we can trust each other!

				Hi everyone<br /><br />I am new to SR, just discovered it a few days ago, and am so excited about what this place has to offer.&nbsp; I have not made any purchases yet, still trying to figure out how to do everything as anonymously as possible.&nbsp; Hoping to do some buying soon.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been doing drugs since I was about 13, started with alcohol then weed (like most people, I suppose), did acid and ecstacy throughout high school, did those and added mushrooms and mdma throughout college.&nbsp; Haven&#039;t done any pscyhedelics in years, stopped smoking weed over a year ago.&nbsp; My drug of choice is cocaine, started doing that when I was 16 and continued (sporadically at times) &#039;til now.&nbsp; I&#039;m most excited for this site because I have always wanted to find some real good, pure as possible shit, and while I&#039;ve done some good stuff, nothing that I think would be considered&quot;real&quot;, pure cocaine.&nbsp; Looks like I&#039;ll finally be able to experience that here on SR.&nbsp; Also always had an interest in trying H, think I may do that now also.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to get this all figured out and make a purchase!

				Hello all, Im anonomiss1 but I travel the road as Josh Alberts. I am enamored with the site, a long time user and drug enthusiast, this is just what the world needs. I like hallucinogens, weed, and pills. It took me awhile to introduce myself, almost a member for about 6 months, I can be a little paranoid. Safe and happy travels to all, and thanks for the creators and admins for all the hard work, keep it up!

				My name is Danceswithwolves. I am not north American Indian :P<br />I go to an art school in the states and I&#039;m very focused on filmmaking and short movies. I came here to order some MDMA, seeing as my local connections are kinda unlegit...

				Hey everybody--<br />I go by 2xT4eB, which is awkward I know.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been hanging out on SR for almost two months now, and have had some terrific experiences--some not so great, but those were usually my fault somehow.&nbsp; I&#039;m like a kid in a candy store!<br /><br />I&#039;m 50 yrs old, been doing this for a long time--so I might be able to contribute to some of the discussions here.&nbsp; One thing I need to say now, and I stress this: if you haven&#039;t been tested for Hep C, DO IT.&nbsp; Practically everyone I know my age has it, and it can be really bad (ie, liver transplant).&nbsp; No fun, let me assure you.<br /><br />So with that, I&#039;ll close for now.&nbsp; Everyone be safe and have a good time!

				Greetings everyone! my name is Rockstafarian, I&#039;ve been on silk road for just a few weeks now and I&#039;m starting to really like this market and the community / discussions here on the forum. I&#039;m an aspiring musician that has contracted that stereotypical music-man&#039;s fascination with drugs : ) . I really enjoy opiates, especially opium because it mixes so well with weed but I have done many others. LSD is probably my favorite drug but as many of you know using a lot of LSD can be kinda difficult to manage so after about 40 trips and a few intense psychedelic experiences that flung me to the edges of my own mind in the past 2 years I&#039;ve slowed down on that... for a little while at least lol<br />I am very interested in all the different drugs and have spend many hours on Erowid researching and learning as much as possible, my friends usually go to me if they have questions about the safe way of doing a drug. I&#039;m all about doing drugs, but being responsible and maintaining a harm-reduction mentality<br />I am creatively wired, and I try to watch out for people as best as I can. I despise the control that governments have on us people and I love the people at SR for creating such a place. Thanks to everyone here at Silk Road for making and maintaining this place, I hope that it continues for a long time so that we can continue to live freely without governments to tell us what we can and can&#039;t do with our bodies!

				Hey guys.<br />My names applesauce. (xD I couldn&#039;t think of a random name.)<br />Anyway, the drugs I specialize in are weed and adderall. Soon I plan on planting some plants and if everything goes good I will attempt to sell some on here. I&#039;ve also got a number of sources to get adderall XR. (Usually 25mg pills.) I get them for $1/10 mg and I don&#039;t plan on marking them up too much. (Enough to cover the shipping cost and a TINY bit more.) <br /><br />I also have a large number of good-to-know shady tech information. Things that include virtual credit card manipulation, getting free stuff (not software/cracks), etc. When I can spare the money to become a seller I 110% plan on sharing some of this with you guys. (I will just sell limited quantities; for stuff like this, the less that know about it, the better.) <br /><br />Anyways, that&#039;s all I have to say and I&#039;m kind of rambling/feel like talking a lot because of adderall xD<br /><br />Cheers!

				Hello everyone! I&#039;m a college student too. Female, English major, but I love science too. Drugs are honestly one of my favorite things. I consider them a hobby. I smoke lots of weed and enjoy MDMA and psychedelics (I&#039;ve done acid and shrooms) and am hoping to try various other drugs in the future. <br /><br />I&#039;m really happy to find that everyone here is super nice and cool! I didn&#039;t think that I&#039;d actually want to come here and hang out, but it&#039;s soooo nice to have other drug-loving not judgey people to talk to. :3

				Hello all, I&#039;m fatespossession and I&#039;ll be placing my first order within the week. Been browsing the site for a couple months now, and my cautious nature had prevented me from making any orders, but now I&#039;ve decided to man the fuck up and purchase some quality shit. <br /><br />Sadly, where I&#039;m located, you&#039;d be hard pressed to find any drug that could be considered worth a shit. Even if you find a bean from someone around here, you&#039;ll be lucky to have even a trace of piperazines in the bean and to expect any hint of MDMA would be laughable. The drugs are few and far between, and when you find them the quality is complete garbage, so you can imagine the allure of SR.<br /><br />To sum myself up, I am a man who believes in the saying &quot;work hard, play hard, in that order&quot;. I go throughout my day busting my ass in every endeavor I partake in, but when I get home I want to turn the productivity off and enjoy the euphoria of some pure, clean drugs. I plan to start with small personal doses of MDMA and Crystal Methylone, moving towards larger orders of the two and random small buys as I look to experience the drugs I have never been able to get my hands on. Looking forward to doing business with and meeting some well-educated drug users.

				Greetings all!<br /><br />&nbsp; I&#039;m Doo, I&#039;m a bitcoin miner and a chef and a thoroughbred handicapper and a writer<br />and an enthusiastic user of various illicit substances.&nbsp; I found this place through the<br />Wired article, actually on the same day my brother mentioned to me there was a site<br />where you could buy weed anonymously.&nbsp; While I am a bit skeptical of buying something<br />that stinks as much as good weed does through the mail, I have made a few purchases<br />over other kinds.&nbsp; Not received any of it yet, but it&#039;s only been a day or two.&nbsp; I am<br />not an impatient guy.&nbsp; Also, I am not imprudent, so all the sellers I purchased from are<br />in the top 10.&nbsp; I don&#039;t anticipate any problems.<br /><br />&nbsp; What I don&#039;t understand is the insistence on the part of some sellers on FE.<br />Specifically what I don&#039;t understand is what difference it makes in the long run<br />whether I finalize early or not.&nbsp; By my count, the seller had sold thousands ($)<br />worth of product on the 3 days around my purchase.&nbsp; So I assume that s/he<br />didn&#039;t particularly need my $30 to reup.&nbsp; I understand, I have 0 purchases, you<br />don&#039;t know me from Adam West.&nbsp; But I just don&#039;t really see what the risk is<br />on the part of the seller to use the system as it was intended to be used.&nbsp; In<br />fact, it seems a tad disingenuous to insist that new users go about their first<br />purchase(s) in the exact way that everyone on the forum says you shouldn&#039;t. <br />It lends an air of disunity to the whole thing.<br /><br />Am I missing something?&nbsp; If the package is intercepted, the risk falls on me, as<br />it&#039;s my name(ish) on the package.&nbsp; In fact, it seems that all the risk is being<br />taken by me once the package is in the system.&nbsp; Barring fingerprints being<br />found or the contents of the package being somehow traceable.&nbsp; But a good,<br />top 10 seller wouldn&#039;t be stupid enough to leave any identifying marks on or<br />in the package.&nbsp; I could just not get my product, then I&#039;m fucked.&nbsp; I could get<br />arrested, then I&#039;m fucked.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how finalizing early is in any way beneficial. <br />If I didn&#039;t have the funds, then I would not have been able to make the purchase<br />in the first place, but it seems like I have to prove myself or something.&nbsp; At the<br />expense of the excellent escrow system.<br /><br />&nbsp;So I guess my question is what benefit is it to the seller for me to FE?<br />And I mean a top vendor, who doesn&#039;t, in fact, actually need my money<br />in order to keep his business afloat.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#039;t just hand a street<br />dealer $20 and trust him to meet me later on, which is what this practice reeks<br />of.&nbsp; I have my money, you have the product, or no sale.&nbsp; Really, I wouldn&#039;t buy<br />from a street dealer anyway.&nbsp; Which brings me here.<br /><br />&nbsp; I do actually hope to become a seller at some point, I am ecstatic that this<br />place exists and flourishes.&nbsp; I&#039;ve long suspected that something like this had<br />to exist, and I&#039;m glad it does.<br /><br />&nbsp; I look forward to getting to know all of you. <br /><br />dtw

Picky about what I put in my body, so I don&#039;t know if I can be convinced to buy anything off here so soon. However, I do have access to a lot of prescription type stuff and have been looking for a way to turn a profit. Reading the sellers guide and all that jazz.<br /><br />I like the internet, and economics, and just being a student of life.

				Heh, (&#039;heh&#039; is a word&nbsp; I use for a little chuckle if anyone was wondering what the hell &#039;heh&#039; means) I&#039;ve never introduced myself in forums before. So might as well start now, <br /><br />Hi, I&#039;m risky and I&#039;m a alco... oh wait wrong intro, bad joke I know, lol. Umm been a SR member for 7 months, and a noob to forums. I used to&nbsp; do a lot of drugs in&nbsp; my late teens and&nbsp; early 20&#039;s back in the&nbsp; late 80&#039;s &amp; early 90&#039;s. Yes, i&#039;m about early 40s if you do the math. I used to be a roadie for some small local death metal bands ( back when death metal was at its peak and I had long hair, I keep it short now) in midwest US, and I have experience in painting and drawing, I currently work as a office drone for record stuff.<br /><br />&nbsp;I did free lance artwork for some local tattoo parlors, Just designs not actually tattooing. Funny thing is I never got a tatt! Clean pasty white skin all the way around. I&#039;m kinda indecisive when it comes to permanent personal art. But I own a bunch of leather jackets with painted metal designs on the outside, I used to freelance in leather designs too. Haven&#039;t done any designs in years. I tell ya,&nbsp; a couple places you can find drugs are Heavy metal concerts and tattoo parlors that&#039;s for sure! There you don&#039;t have to look for the dealers, they look for you! Like a soviet russia meme joke lol.<br /><br />So I used to do all kinds of nasty street drugs like&nbsp; smoking ghetto pcp( god I was dumb then), LSD ( I used to deal blotter in RL a couple of times ,and I sucked as one), shrooms, cut to hell coke( :::shiver:::), and homemade ( by dealers, not me. It was like Trucker&#039;s Speed) speed. Somehow made it alive without a police record or OD. Dumb luck and a little caution to help. Weed was mostly cheap indica stuff back then. I kinda prefer sativa weed nowadays. I&#039;m a casual on and off again kinda user that just hangs with a few using friends from the past. No big parties or concerts really for me anymore. I keep to a small social circlce of friends and relatives. No wife, no kids,... so look out ladies.. .:::coughs::: Hmm, the forums aren&#039;t exactly an online dating hookup for drug users, are they ?&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I like to walk along...... BIG rails on a mirror with a rolled up bill and.... ahh...forget it.&quot;&nbsp; &quot; But Officer, I thought you were my online date, and a blonde lady with supermodel looks, please don&#039;t bust me for possession!&quot;<br /><br />I haven&#039;t told my friends yet that I get my stuff from the SR and the internet. They just think I got some good IRL hookups, heh. Think I&#039;ll tell em one day to blow to their minds while they are high. So that is about me in a nutshell. Like that old austin powers joke,&quot; No, This is me in a nutshell. Help, get me out, I&#039;m trapped in a nutshell!&quot;

				Huh... hi?<br />So well yeah I&#039;m not new on tor but new on SR, still discovering the place so to speak. I&#039;m mostly here in the hope of buying some weed in a few months (when I&#039;ll get a little more cash to convert in BC), but also because I enjoy talking on pharmaceutical drugs (SSRIs, benzos etc.) which I find rather interesting.<br />Otherwise I&#039;m a very average and boring person I think, except my social skills are nil, and my sexual orientation is officially &quot;weirdo&quot;. <br /><br />I don&#039;t plan to sell anything, so for now I will continue lurking mostly, and start buying later.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop here because I can&#039;t see a reason why someone would want to read more about me.<br /><br />Have fun!

				Hello, I am Youngzeld, and I am fairly new to the site, and obviously the forum as well. I am currently back in school (although feeling a little too old) to finish a master&#039;s program in business. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also enjoy a profession that affords me the ability to work around my school schedule for the time being. I practice jiu-jitsu 3 times a week, and work striking with pads or sparring at least once a week just to stay in shape.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I am truly excited to be part of the progressive, intelligent, and unique crowd here on the SR forum. Hopefully I can help to further the discussion. My opinion is that, within the U.S. at least, we have far too many of our personal freedoms impinged upon without much consideration for the common man&#039;s rationale.

				Hello everyone. Just found out SR exists a couple of weeks ago and couldn&#039;t believe it. I&#039;ve been lurking, reading the forum and such as a guest, and finally have my PGP, and BTC stuff all figured out. <br /><br />Hate to, but have to agree with the previous poster&#039;s (mouser53) statement about getting older and losing all my old connections. I live in a major US city, so it doesn&#039;t seem like it should be hard to find people to go to, but getting older has made me more paranoid as well. :-P Oh, well, we&#039;ll see how this works. <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read the community here is pretty nice, so I hope to have a good experience here, and perhaps meet (digitally) some cool new people.<br /><br />Nice to meet you all! :-)

				Hello all.&nbsp; New to Silk Road, still haven&#039;t bought anything yet.&nbsp; I was introduced to it by a friend who&#039;d read the gawker article.&nbsp; It was actually pretty embarrassing because she&#039;s very much a rookie when it comes to all things drug related, and I&#039;ve bought drugs on the internet before but I had no idea about this Silk Road thing.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; But my past purchases were on a couple of small boards way back in 2007/2008.&nbsp; We thought hushmail and western union were pretty secure and anonymous.&nbsp; We were adorable.&nbsp; Anyway, I fell out of it after those boards disappeared and it was probably a good thing honestly as I didn&#039;t have the money to keep up the habit at the time anyway.&nbsp; Seems like times have really changed since then, so I will definitely have some catching up to do on the technology.

				hi everyone! i am lovethemblues. as you can imagine from my name opioid and opiates are my favorite drug type. i have used online/international pharmacies for the past year or so and about half of every order was a rip off, so i am very glad to have found a trustworthy place for purchasing the goods i desire without having to go to the bad side of town. i am very thankful for the escrow system that sr has in place as it makes me comfortable being here and really like the anonymity of the tor. thanks for everything SR and looking forward to doing some business with a few trustworthy/regular vendors !<br /><br />have a good day everyone :)

I&#039;d heard of SR a while back but only recently realized its potential, I guess I only really needed it once I started experimenting more drugs.<br /><br />Glad to be here, and even though the level of professionalism can be pretty ambivalent I love the vibe I&#039;m getting.<br /><br />frenchie

I mean, I understand it, but when someone will outright refuse to sell to me, just because I haven&#039;t been here as long as they have, kinda irks me.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o<br /><br />I look forward to establishing some good history here, thanks all!<br /><br />

Ive been here 3 days, and placed 3 orders with separate buyers. I am not the least bit concerned, thanks to uniwiz&#039;s thread on cannabis vendors. Research before you buy. Don&#039;t buy more than you can afford to lose. Stuff I&#039;m sure you know already, but I figure its all worth restating.<br /><br />Have a great day!

				Wussup people? Not sure how active I&#039;ll be here, but I&#039;ll be poking around a little. I am a hated patriot because I love the American people, like our forefathers did, but hate the tyranny and oppression that has come to define our elected officials. I am therefore hated by my government, but I&#039;m okay with that, I actually cope quite well. Anyway, glad this place is still kickin&#039;. I used to be a seller on SR but after my first three sales every single person claimed to not receive their goods. It was my opinion that further throwing away of my product would be stupid, so I discontinued all involvement with SR. I&#039;m back to take advantage of my options as a consumer and not a vendor. You people who order shit and then say you didn&#039;t get it should fuck off and die. It&#039;s bad enough that we have to hide in order to do business, now you fucking thieves are fucking that up as well. <br /><br />Anyway, I gotta lot of catching up to do.

How about we send them adulterated shit that seriously injures them&nbsp; :P It&#039;s not like they don&#039;t deserve getting a random mix of potent RCs instead of whatever they ordered.<br /><br />If you change your mind and want to sell again though, using a DCN can greatly help in claiming the money that you did in fact earn.

				I wont say I&#039;ll never ever sell again, but it will be a while if I do again. For now, I&#039;m hoping to find vendors who were like me, who ship fast, weigh bags heavy and send nothing but the best. I move alot, so I&#039;m always without a steady source. That&#039;s the reason why I figured signing up here would be worthwhile. It gives me some shot at picking out the scammers. I&#039;ll pay the premium prices some of these guys are asking if I actually get what I&#039;m paying for. <br /><br />Lol, it&#039;s kinda mean, but I wish I woulda known those people were gonna screw me before I sent their stuff, I woulda definitely dosed that shit up with some 2c-i<br /><br />

				I’m Twilight Sparkle. I am not into new age stuff - the name comes from My Little Pony.<br />I was introduced to SR by my husband who (among other great things) is an IT geek + an anarchist.<br />I started taking hard drugs around the age of 20. I am happy that I started relatively late. Though loving drugs completely and utterly I think I have always managed to keep an OK balance between the party and the “serious life”.<br />I was a part of the rave movement from early/mid 1990s and on. I have had different phases in my life with drugs: in the beginning it was mostly LSD, then there was a period with speed, and finally it was mainly ecstasy (usually in combination with speed).&nbsp; Weed has been a returning companion.<br />Today I am a mother and live a seemingly straight and busy life with a great job and lots of responsibilities. Needless to say my playing around with drugs has become a super controlled activity. I use them with my friends when I have a night away from the family, in very strict amounts. Occasionally we might go away to Berlin for a weekend to party. I take only ecstasy / mdma now (and smoke weed) - these two drugs are king to me. <br />I have been on SR for about a month, made a couple of purchases so far: ecstasy pills, which are impossible for me to find here (can only get mdma). <br />It makes me so DEEPLY happy to be here, together with such a wide range of personalities – all so different, however sharing our common interest in liberty and drugs. It gives me hope for the future, and I love all of you. <br /><br />

				(Sorry if I ramble. I am very high) Hello, I&#039;m daytimetripper, and if you couldn&#039;t guess, I love hallucinogenics. My main drug of choice though would have to be Mary Jane. And no, I&#039;m not talking about spidermans girlfriend. I came here mainly to get a steady supply of lsd, shrooms, maybe some synthetic hallucinogens, and probably some DMT if I don&#039;t end up making it myself. I am curious about maybe trying some MDMA from here also. I&#039;ve tried just some dragonfly and simpson thizz pills from around here, and they were alright, so im wondering what real molly would be like. I have a really steady supply of some super fire buds for good prices here so probably won&#039;t buy any trees from here. I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll like the road, and any tips would be greatly appreciated, weather it be about buying safely, or avoiding scams, or even if you feel generous enough to send me some BTC :) . I am also A very experienced tripper and a cannabis connoisseur and will gladly sample anything and provide detailed feedback.&nbsp;

				hello to my fellow travelers on the Silk Road!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been on SR for 2 months now, and though I don&#039;t post much I do like to read a lot of the message threads. I have been quite impressed with many, many of the community members here--intelligent, dedicated, creative people abound! <br /><br />I am a lover of pretty much all drugs: uppers, downers, screamers, laughers, etc. etc.&nbsp; I&#039;m also an attorney in the USA, and a guitar player in my spare time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m definitely not a veteran around here, but for any total newbies, one thing I have learned the hard way on SR: Don&#039;t finalize early!! Or rather, only do it if the seller has a stellar reputation, BOTH on their mainpage feedback and on the message board review threads. Otherwise, don&#039;t do it! You lose any protection against scam sellers (who are unfortunately too common) and against mistakes. <br /><br />Hope all are well!&nbsp; ...except for lurking law enforcement, of course, to whom I say FUCK THE POLICE!<br />cheers,<br />La Nuit

				Hi folks<br /><br />Fairly new member on SR, but no stranger to mail order. <br /><br />Made my first purchase from BudMonkey if anyone remembers that far back.<br /><br />Mail order services such as SR are a godsend for those like me who are no longer kids. A middle-aged man approaching a street dealer youth now looks like something far dodgier than a simple drug deal.<br /><br />Of course, now that i&#039;ve had access to the numerous high quality products available on SR, there&#039;s no way id ever go back to buying the shite thats now flooded the streets on the UK.<br /><br />Anyways, i&#039;m chinese, in my 30s and run my own business. Never asked or got any government handouts, never been unemployed and contribute a good chunk of taxes..<br /><br />I hope SR runs and runs, allowing me to indulge in my favourite smokey passtime without causing anyone any grief.

				Hi. I&#039;m someone who is lucky to have realized that drug use can be a positive - very positive.<br />Mainly interested in psychedelics.<br /><br />So far using Silk Road has been a very cozy kind of pleasure.

				Hello! I do not personally take drugs recreationally, but I absolutely support the rights of the individual to do what they want to their bodies without any government interference. I am currently on enough prescribed medications that I swear that I might as WELL be taking them for pleasure. It amazes me (and disgusts me) that I can go into a pharmacy and buy meth, speed, oxy... LEGALLY... yet, if someone wants to purchase it through a friend or someone else that it&#039;s ILLEGAL. I&#039;m fed up with stupid, pointless, idiotic laws and freedom-leeching restrictions, and I&#039;m happy to find a community that feels the same way I do.

				This is an amazing place. I am overwhelmed, and simply trying to take it all in. To be honest I am completely new to all of this, but am excited to learn everything I can.<br /><br />I found the Silk Road while looking for a method to sell legal items anonymously using Google ad service. It is perfectly legal for these items to be sold, but I am personally contractually obligated not to sell these items at this time. I need to be able to collect credit card information, and at the same time let no one, including the bank and government know the source of the funds. This is a big task I am sure, but I would greatly appreciate all help. <br /><br />Anyway, I look forward to spending time here, and feel free to send me a private message.

But the atmosphere is same.<br />I have a deep depression diagnosis so I have to take quite amount pills everyday. Still trying to survive and enjoy life as long as I can get.<br />I like music, (auto)biographies, movies, carpentering, summer, wine, women... Keep rocking &#039;n rolling fellow members!

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />I&#039;m a student studying computer science in the UK and have been learning about drugs, their effects on the body and how they work since late 2010! I&#039;m the go-to-guy for drug related questions in my friend circles, I feel that knowing the substance of your choice like the back of your hand is the way to go. <br /><br />My path in to the world of illicit substances started in 2009 where a small group of friends and I hotboxed a tent. First time getting high was the best experience I&#039;ve ever had to date! I then moved on to nitrous oxide which quickly became an all time favourite, I even sold it at my school for a while! Since then I&#039;ve tried salvia (hell of a trip), 2C-C NBOMe (small dose, felt serene happiness), MXE (personal favourite, experienced complete ego death. When mixed with weed I experienced the most intense, powerful journey I&#039;ve ever had), DXM (come up was incredible). Most recently I tried MDMA at a rave, being my first stimulant I wasn&#039;t prepared for how incredible it was, definitely will be doing it again!<br /><br />That&#039;s all from me, thanks for reading!

				Hello Peeps<br />So been lurking and reading, researching and informing myself of the whole SR process for about a month now. And just this week I&#039;ve been making posts and finally feeling confident enough to make a purchase with SR. Anywho the username was inspired by my remembering that I needed to get more cat food for my two cats...I don&#039;t know where the starfish came from O.o<br /><br />I&#039;m a Clinical Therapist and have always been interested in the controlled use of certain drugs in the use of Therapy. As a therapist we learn to be 100% empathetic with clients...this came naturally to me...that and I figured all them years of raving back in highschool/college also helped build my Empathy ;)<br /><br />Recently I&#039;ve been rethinking my theory and model for change in the human psyche and after looking at SR and such I was reminded of PLUR hahaha wow does that bring back memories.<br /><br />Seems like lots of informed and interesting peeps here. Hope to get some good convos going with some interesting people here on various topics. Thinking back on the first posts&#039; mention of &quot;what you can offer to the community&quot; Well...as a Therapist with 7years experience in the field I wouldn&#039;t mind answering questions if you have any regarding experiences with bad trips, drug side effects (like one course away from my cadc), etc.<br /><br />Take care everyone

				Oh dear.. People really need to stop harping on about people sounding like LE. Yes, they&#039;re here. No, they&#039;re not stupid enough to let you know who they are. - Or they might want to buddy up to vendors/buyers for an inevitable bust; buddying up to buyers sounds more probable than vendors, they might try to eventually meet IRL... May as well err on the side of caution and discourage superfluous OPs like the aforementioned. Sounds doubtful, at least don&#039;t make worthless threads, as mentioned next:<br /><br />I&#039;m sure that danknugsdun simply meant that he plans to meet new contacts for his drug of choice. - Why not suggest posting in Off-topic instead? At least keep this subforum for Silk Road Discussion?<br /><br />My apologies if I&#039;m coming off a bit harsh here but people really need to chill out a bit. - It could appear as though they are making/will make an effort to snare unwary vendors/buyers, and I think I have a valid point. So too bad.<br />

Lsd being my main drug of interest, I hope I can finally use the wonderful service that is SR to get some.<br />I&#039;d like to thank people that started this anon marketplace for they have done something, that many would not do due to lack of balls.

Nobody judged and called them trash.&nbsp; I don&#039;t use meth, but I respect people&#039;s choice if they do, and I was amazed to see others there acting the same way.<br /><br />All I want is freedom and safety in this life.&nbsp; I want to be able to experience my own body on my own terms, not &quot;their&quot; terms.&nbsp; For some reason I don&#039;t understand why that is such a frowned upon idea.&nbsp; I must be weird, but if I am, I don&#039;t want to be normal. I don&#039;t want to even be around the &quot;normal&quot; people. I want to be around other &quot;weirdos.&quot; <br /><br />I love life, I love adventures, I love jumping without looking as long as I think I&#039;ll land safely. I think the world is wonderful. There is nothing to fear, but fear itself.<br /><br />-TrippySkies

				Hi, I&#039;m PokerLotto. I&#039;m a new vendor, but I&#039;ve lurked on the Silk Road since June 2011. This forum account will be used to oversee the service I&#039;ve created, which is a way to play poker through the Silk Road and forums. I&#039;ve think I&#039;ve come up with a good method where people can verify that I run a legitimate game.<br /><br />I look forward to being your &quot;dealer.&quot; ;D

Have had a terrible past with drug addiction and I don&#039;t plan on falling back in to so I will be only small occasional purchases and already have my eye on Tony and his Keta. It&#039;s been 7 years clean and well... I want a treat for my birthday:) ..&nbsp; I think I&#039;ll use the 420 sale. Now... I have a million questions regarding bitcoins and wallets in Canada .

				Hi Dougie:<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty new myself and signed up in January. it took about a month to figure stuff out. Eventually I got a moneypak from Walmart for $150 cash so I would limit my losses to that amt if it went south. I went on the forums for the money guys and found 3 vendors that always delivered but were kind of expensive. BTCBuddy, Sugar Mama, and BTCpal. All charge between 8 and 25% for exchanging your moneypak for bitcoins. Advantage in this technique is that you can do it easily and anonymously without opening up your own acct with Mtgox (a bitcoin trading organization) then opening up an ewallet. I will probably still do that and there are plenty of forum pages that will walk you through that process. I am using Sugar Mama most recently and expect a 2-6 day delivery time from my order. The charge is dependent on the moneypak amount.&nbsp; you can usually find sugar mama by clicking on the money icon on the left side of the opening page of Silk Road. Then follow her instructions exactly on how to order bitcoins from her. You have to have your moneypak amount and the moneypak code on the card you buy from Walmart or Walgreens or CVS pharmacy. The order page has a box for you to put that info in. There is another box for your password (not your SR password but your acct password). You also have to click on the ellipsis on the top of your order form that has the delivery method. Do that first and then click update before you put your MP # and amt.<br />Expensive and a little slow, but anonymous and reliable (at least with the ones I mentioned).<br />Once you see the bitcoins show up, order your poison of choice. then that wait starts. finally, you&#039;ll be rewarded with DRUGS IN THE MAIL ;D Yahoo!

				Hi, I&#039;m banango and I&#039;m on SR primarily for the weed. Although it&#039;s easy for me to acquire drugs &quot;on the street&quot;, I find SR offers a variety and quality control that I&#039;d never find there. I&#039;d be really hardpressed to find a blueberry or bubblegum strain if I were doing it the conventional way, but on SR it&#039;s just a few clicks away from arriving on the doorstep.<br /><br />I&#039;m fascinated with all aspects of growing, preparing and smoking cannabis. I&#039;m obsessive over my quest to roll the perfect joint, I&#039;ve just perfected my own roach design, which I&#039;m unashamedly proud of. I dream of one day eloping to a foreign land to cultivate my own patch of paradise.<br /><br />Interests include philosophy, literature, nature, the usual.<br /><br />Finally, I think SR stands for more than a convenient method to acquire drugs, and I&#039;m grateful to be a part of it.

				hello! welcome to the forums :) yeah its alot to take in at first!<br /><br />The best piece of advice you could get is to just read/learn about how SR/Bitcoins/the various encryption methods work as to avoid any mix up later on. defiantly do not rush into your first buy.<br /><br />As to not getting busted below is a link to a very good guide on staying anonymous on SR from setting up librete (a live linux distro perfect for SR use) to getting your coins into SR safely.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15383.0<br /><br />Secondly about getting ripped off, stay up to date in the forums any scammers/suspected scammers might have a post or two about them. Also use the vendor&#039;s page to view stats on them such as success rate, amount of sales etc.<br /><br />Lastly a very important one,&nbsp; if a vendor asks you to finalize early ( release your funds from escrow) then there is not much you can do if something were to happen. Some vendors ask newer members to do this, but id advise finding different vendors until you have a high enough rating.<br /><br />Sorry if i ran though things a bit fast just giving you a quick overview. But as said up top READ READ READ!<br /><br />If you need anything else just let me know!<br />

I&#039;m not ready to move to Portugal, but I supposedly live in a &quot;free&quot; country and it&#039;s wonderful to see us band together and take the risk to be free. I&#039;m sick of driving around the block 10min, or being in a parking lot like a sitting duck.&nbsp; This is the way to do it folks, lets all just be careful and have each other&#039;s backs.&nbsp; Love to everyone

				Hi all.&nbsp; Tremendous thanks to everyone out their that makes this site an existence.&nbsp; This is truly a godsend.&nbsp; It also warms my heart to know that this kind of place actually exists.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had a long, bad experience with psychiatric medication, and don&#039;t wish pretty much all of those drugs I took on others.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically, I&#039;ve been really depressed for a really long time (not that having depression is unique :p), and I know by now which drugs help me and which one&#039;s don&#039;t.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also done tons of research on drugs in general and on SR, especially for personal health.&nbsp; Drug safety aside, being a convicted felon would not be good for my mental health.<br /><br />Like every new person, I&#039;m extremely paranoid and anxious about this, despite setting up basically every protection I can.&nbsp; While lurking, I was really paranoid about vendors, about forum members, but I think I&#039;ve gotten it under control as this place seems like a genuine community.&nbsp; I know established vendors don&#039;t like to be messaged, but I&#039;m not too sure how open people are to being PM&#039;ed here on this forum, I don&#039;t want to accidentally contribute to the flooding of messages some people might get.

Im so incredibly stoked about my future endeavors on here. Ive been reading up on everything the past few days and cant wait to order some benzos. So many online &#039;pharmacies&#039; are complete scams, ever since my doctor cut my alprazolam script, i have been searching for a legitamate, reputable and reasonably priced source for awhile. I have been off and on xanax/klonopin for a few years with a script, all was well until i got cut off. I am convinced my needs will be met by some vendors on SR. I consider myself a freelance entrepreneur. Im always in the market for cheap substances i can turn a profit off of, particularly H and benzos. Im used to doing business in person in real life and never considered using the internet and postal service, I guess we really are in the future.

Looking at market it is amazing how it is being run and how anonymous it is. I still have a lot to learn and how to use this site.<br /><br />But I would like to point out that I was able to find this place after hearing about the famer’s market shutdown.

				Well i have finally made the plunge onto SR this past week. Have known about the road for a long time now but never had a helping hand till this past week and i am sad i never just went off and did this myself a long time ago. So glad to finally be apart of this community of like minded people. Was walked through my first purchase on a friends account last Friday on 420&nbsp; ;D and how fitting that was the day i finally signed my ass up. I look forward to doing business with the sellers out there and getting to know you all as much as you can as an anon. haha. <br /><br />A little about myself i work in the medical field and i am what some would call a nerd but i like to call my self a gifted genius. I am very open minded and love to debate. I hate social norms because who the fuck gets to tell me what normal is. I love music, drugs and socially interacting with others. I fucking hate politics but i love them at the same time but i will keep politics out of this place because that is just to much drama for such a happy and awesome place like this. <br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to walk down this road with all my new friends on here.<br /><br />Much love,<br />InTransit

I know it sounds a bit strange, because I&#039;m a 0 post user who wasn&#039;t able to exchange enough money, BUT I&#039;m pleasing a kind-hearted user who could send me those 60 bitcents.. because I&#039;m looking forward to get an hardcore SR user XDD <br /><br />Have a nice day!<br />OD87

				Good morning/afternoon/evening or whenever the hell you may read this. Name is SequelTo33rpm. I&#039;ve been on here for a few months actually but never got around to properly introducing myself. Big fan of LSD, 25I-NBOMe, and to a lesser extent MDMA. I am a neuropsychology major and drugs has been a huge area of focus for me, even becoming part of my honors thesis for university. It&#039;s astounding how much misinformation and just outright lies are put out on a daily basis by people who have a responsibility to ensure others stay safe. It&#039;s fucking incredible that a community like this can exist and behave so well on its own. We are a community of mostly adult, responsible users who make it a priority to still fulfill our obligations in life. There is the occasional scamming vendor or douchebag customer, but in contrast with how much success and sheer decency there has been on SR, it&#039;s mind-blowing how well this has come together. SR is the future of the drug trade and so far it&#039;s going swimmingly. As a side note, if any of you guys ever have a problem you wish to talk about or just vent, minor or major, message me anytime and I&#039;ll do my best to help you out and offer advice. Anything that can be done to make this community a healthier, more responsible one is another kick in the face to people who say drugs are just intrinsically bad and any one who uses them deserves harsh and draconian punishments. Everything will be kept 100% anonymous and please for fuck&#039;s sake, do not use any real names and make up locations. Safety and security first. If anyone wants my PGP key for better security, just ask. Peace and much respect to you all.

				I came here after being told about it by a friend a while ago, it&#039;s only now that I&#039;ve signed up.<br /><br />My main problem is finding good Ket in the UK, the only people I knew that could supply me with it had stopped taking it after they abused it too often.&nbsp; I could still get some, but the quality had gone downhill after recent crack downs in India.<br /><br />So essentially, I came here for drugs (duh!) but when I read the State of the Road Address post, I fell in love:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.&nbsp; It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.&nbsp; We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.&nbsp; A revolution has been born.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Powerful words, because while getting high is fun, it&#039;s much bigger than that.<br /><br />From my heart I wish everyone here love.&nbsp; I hope nobody ends up being punished for setting up this wonderful site that allows people to do as they see fit with their own body and mind.<br /><br />Much love to the admins.<br />Much love to the sellers.<br />Much love to the community.

				I&#039;m here to get LSD, shrooms and DMT for me and my friends. I live in a very &quot;straight&quot; corporate world (fortune 50 desk jockey) and I know a lot of people who lead very controlled and predictable lives, and so end up with gaping holes in their spirits. I&#039;ve smoked so many people out for the first time I can&#039;t even remember them all. I introduce hallucinogens to people who seem ready for them. I remind them not to take life so seriously. It makes me a popular guy.<br /><br />Thank you to the vendors, you take a big risk to do this. I hope that you make massive quantities of money and retire rich on a boat.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Hello SR!<br /><br />I&#039;ve not placed any orders yet, but I am posting here to make my presence known :)<br /><br />I&#039;m a self-proclaimed intellectual with a love for psychedelics (and substances in general).&nbsp; I have tried all of the &quot;classic&quot; drugs and I&#039;ve been lucky enough to try several tryptamines, phens, and a few cathinones as well (before the &quot;temporary&quot; emergency scheduling by the DEA).&nbsp; Not to mention lots of other odds and ends (entheogens, other natural substances, etc).<br /><br />I was very excited to hear about SR from an old neighbor of mine, and I was skeptical for quite a while.&nbsp; I read a little more into it, and the new knowledge + a severe LSD drought in my area brought me here, where I hope to spread the love :)<br /><br />I believe that responsible drug use can be not only safe, but beneficial to a person with a strong enough mind.&nbsp; Some people just SHOULD NOT fuck with drugs, and those people know who they are!<br /><br />Anyways,&nbsp; I look forward to the near future, where I intend to dive right in to all SR has to offer :)<br /><br />later,<br />AA

				I have been stumbling through the forums and main site for over a month now. I must say, the community here is fucking tremendous (minus the scammers/lamers)! I have been talking with some vendors, creating and reading some forum threads, just to get a little familiarized with how things work. I saw this thread and figured since I plan on nestling in here, I better introduce myself. Primarily I am a pirate, grabbing anything from a barney song to newest movie or leaked sex tape (NOT CP). I also like my fair share of drugs and HATE going to the ghetto. I&#039;m just a pussy ass white boy, I don&#039;t belong in there (i get robbed)! Hopefully my stay here is as pleasant as I&#039;m looking forward to. So far any questions I have had for the forums or a specific user has been answered thoroughly. I couldn&#039;t really ask for more when it comes to a helpful community. This really isn&#039;t an intro for me since I can&#039;t really give any personal info but I can tell you that gas is 4 fucking dollars a gallon and rising! Good day everyone and I hope to run into a lot of you soon!<br /><br />-MIB

				Hey, Folks...<br /><br />Found the TOR network about a week ago...been ripping through it, trying to see all there is on here. My take is that either: a) there&#039;s not much on the Darknet, mostly because websites want page views, and there&#039;s very little you can&#039;t discuss on the clearnet already, or b) I just ain&#039;t that good searchin&#039; it out. Mind you, I&#039;ve been at the Hidden Wiki, Hack BB, Zerodays, The Abyss, etc...<br /><br />Been lurking here, and looking at the very tempting offerings on SR...what I was very happy about was the Drug Safety forum. On the tangential site where &quot;hard&quot; drugs are bought and sold, there is also very frank discussion about safe using, toxicity and addiction.&nbsp; If ever there was a place where wise words are needed, it&#039;s here. I highly recommend erowid.org as well.<br /><br />Be safe, be smart and remember that just because someone is offering you candy, doesn&#039;t mean you should stuff your face with it...<br /><br />GuyD

Nobody here in the toolies has been able to help me out and I had all but resigned myself to never having that experience again when I stumbled on an article about Silk Road. Just looking at the deliciousness on the site is making my mouth water. Hope I clear the learning curve pretty soon so I can get started. Wish me luck.

				Hi everyone, :)<br /><br />Found SR very recently after some horrendous losses to non-domestic MOMs and looking for other options. A friend mentioned it and Google led me here. Bought my first Bitcoins and made my first purchase and was very impressed. I all feels very new and the Escrow system seems a revelation in the MOM world. Really interested to see how things develop here.<br /><br />Hope to build up my reputation as a decent customer and might even try selling in the future. Have a few RC&#039;s left over from various benders and possible mushrooms, if I can bare to part with them! Just looking to get rid of things that could earn me a few Bitcoins. Seems safer than going on the street to me, so seriously considering it.<br /><br />I&#039;m a medicinal cannabis user and believer in controlled legalization of all drugs and SR brings an open market that could help the world move towards that. Love the philosophy behind it.<br /><br />Mainly here for the pot, that but really interested to see how things progress and want to be a part of it.

Also, thanks for a few kind words here and there from HappySmoke420 and usp6615gawd.&nbsp; &nbsp;It ssems like you you have a good community here and I am happy now to be joining it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />freeside

				Hi all,<br /><br />Just a lowly consumer wishing to satiate my base desires. Perhaps one day, after spending enough time using SR and as a part of the SR Forums I&#039;ll have a level of knowledge sufficient enough to start as a vendor. Fingers crossed this brave new world remains longs enough for me to fulfill that dream.<br /><br />I sucked it up and made the plunge into the Deep Web and SR last night after having knowledge of it for some time. Fed up with the shitty dealers and gear in my corner of Aus. <br /><br />All I can say is that this place give me enough of a fucking rush to rival gear, holy shit is this place awesome. <br />Trying to learn the pitfalls of using SR as quick as I can, its both harder in some respects and easier in some respects than I was lead to believe. The forum community seem fucking awesome and surprisingly articulate I must say. <br /><br />I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to ask a newb question regarding how things are packaged, particularly for shipment to Aus? Or is that a no-no,&nbsp; don&#039;t want to give it away to whoever may be watching type of detail?<br /><br />Cheers

				Oioi - <br /><br />noticed this handy little thread. Nice to meet everyone, I joined the forums to post a review of a vendor a couple days ago, thought I&#039;d see what&#039;s what whilst at it. Heard about SR a while ago, decided to check it out just for shits and giggles, thought it looked legit, bought some weed just to see, boom. Now I&#039;ve spent a couple hours looking through all the pages for substances I can&#039;t get IRL. Methinks a bank visit is due soon...<br /><br />Peace, JPS.<br /><br />

				Hello! I&#039;m Wackster, kind of a cheesy name but when diving into this world i found out by personal reasons this would be the fittest :)<br />Just started with the deepweb and this makes me very curious! I learn quickly and have now setup my TOR pm, tormail, GNU for encrypting and finally joining this forum and participating/observing will be the final &quot;stage&quot; of my initializing process. I make profit by selling drugs, and I live in Scandinavia, which opens for possibilities you cannot imagine. Murder, burglary and different jobs are topics I have barely touched, but become very familiar with. I have connections internationally, but I would like to get to know some of you. Also looking for a regular drug-float somewhere in europe. Cannabis, cocaine and amfetamine are the main drugs. In addition, I&#039;m looking for a driver/smugler so that it would be easier for all parts. Communication between the different cells is highly prioritized and privacy is important, at least in the beginning until we know we can trust each other and start earning som good cash! I&#039;m open for conversation, and hope to get to know many of you and make profittable and safe business with you!<br /><br />-Wackster<br />TOR mail: wackster7@tormail.org<br />TOR PM: wackster7<br />

				Hello every one iv only been around for two months right before Noriega and Tony disappeared im glade i didn&#039;t have any bitcoins&nbsp; during the sale .I have&nbsp; ordered from at least 8 vendors searching for the best and i did like Noriega product but the truth from my experience is most of the cocainee is right above average better than what i can find in the streets right now and that&#039;s why ill pay the higher prices.&nbsp; I would like to ask every one a question and maybe someone can answer. The best coke i ever had was in Jamaica no im not Jamaican i was there on vacation and the coke wasn&#039;t fish scale it wasn&#039;t even white it was off whit tan or yellowish and it was a completely better experience than anything i ever could get at home it was smooth and creamy and made you feel happy and lasted a long time it even felt like a creamy oil when it driped down your throat.&nbsp; Also it wasn&#039;t that expensive.&nbsp; Has any one else ever had coke like that ?&nbsp; Im wondering since there are people on hear from all over the world why no one has mentioned or offered cocaine of this type.&nbsp; And why does every one think fish scale is the best you can get.

				Hi everyone, I&#039;m Mark2012NL, I&#039;m from Holland (NL ;) ) and am currently just a buyer looking for Adderall.<br />The prices here are way higher than college campus-prices I read on websites, but hopefully someone will start some competitive pricing soon...<br /><br />I have actually been growing weed for a few years as a hobby, always grow the best stuff and mainly biological (no pesticides, just mineral nutrients), a few months ago I grew a special 24% THC strain that&#039;s pretty exclusive to real hobby growers and all the people I sell to here always tell me my stuff is the best in town. I might start selling here and undercut some prices, but I only have experience with receiving international post, almost no experience shipping outwards. If I would start selling I could drive to Germany for shipping, but this is just a very flimsy idea, too much risk and too little supply.

I can see his vision, i think, and now that I have seen what I have seen, and heard what I have heard, I can no longer stand idly by.<br /><br />This is my stand. For the longest time, I was &quot;a rebel without cause&quot; but there is more than enough cause, but there was no Cause.<br /><br />In you, my anonymous friends, I have found my Cause.<br /><br />One day, when I feel I am ready, I will journey through the world of entheogenic tryptamines, but until that time, when I feel I am mature enough and ready to pop that cherry, I will stick to stimulants, particularly empathogens.<br /><br />In terms of life goals and carreer, I&#039;ll probably develop some amazing new P2P instant messaging and distributed social networking network (not a decentralized federation of servers, a fully supernode-P2P network) that integrates and works seamlessly with the Tor, Bitcoin, Bittorrent, and Jabber networks to deliver content, enable fully anonymous payments where even my grandmother could do it with her ancient dos box (provided she upgraded to a modern version of freedos, she probably wouldnt notice the difference).<br /><br />I LOVE P2P networks, they are my passion.<br /><br />Nearly all of the time spent on the computer is either spent learning about P2P networks, studying them for the sheer joy of discovery, or chatting with people who populate the P2P and P2P-related discussion places, be they IRC channels, forums, and whatnot.<br /><br />I love Silk Road because not only does it put pressure on the street sellers to compete, and competition is always good for buyers, but provides a reasonably safe and secure alternative to trying to buy from some street corner dude in the bad part of town. Silk Road PROVES how powerful P2P technologies such as Tor and Bitcoin REALLY are.<br /><br />Although the Silk Road hidden service is not decentralized, and has an internal bitcoin mixer rather than decentralizing control, the centralization is probably a good thing in this case, as it allows (competant) administrators to swiftly respond to threats to service, including psychological operations, service interruption or disruption, and other malicious elements.<br /><br />I probably shouldnt write too much more, as the leos are on the prowl. but i&#039;m always here, feel free to PM me.

				Welcome to you both, and welcome myself! I&#039;ve been a buyer, but with a different username, for about four months. I&#039;ve had mostly successful transactions save for a few scams, but that&#039;s all part of the game, I suppose. This community definitely has it&#039;s up and it&#039;s downs with a broad range of personalities, and it&#039;s very valuable. I hope to keep my experiences with vendors on the vendor review threads updated. Good luck to you all!

				The details of my life are quite inconsequential ... Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery.

				Hello,<br /><br />My name is Jaki! The &quot;Stirner&quot; is a reference to one of my favorite anarchist writers. I&#039;ve known about SR for a while now but just today decided to see what it had to offer. I&#039;m not very impressed with a lot of the pricing, but there are a few things here and there I&#039;m going to have to give a shot come pay day.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I like pretty much everything but stims, but I especially like dissociatives and psychedelics. My worldview makes it hard for me to avoid bad trips from psys, as I see the world from an anarchist perspective, with politicians and capitalists manipulating and exploiting and murdering in order to preserve their power and wealth. This view seems even sharper and more poignant while tripping and generally leaves me feeling sick, depressed, and often suicidal. <br /><br />I now work a civilian job in customer service that I very much dislike, but not nearly as much as I disliked being enlisted in the US Army. My coworkers are nice and are the one redeeming quality of the job. <br /><br />I am bi/pansexual and I have a lot of excruciating questions about my gender identity. I go from deciding to live as a man or live as a woman and back again, but whichever I choose, my mind screams at me that I am wrong, due to various insecurities, fears, and uncertainties. I am in therapy and I have a wonderful transgender girlfriend who is trying to help me through this. The drugs help, too. <br /><br />So that&#039;s me. Probably a lot more information than you care to know.&nbsp; :P

				I&#039;m Polack, and it&#039;s cool for me to use the slur because I&#039;ve got a parent with two actual Polish Poles from Poland for THEIR parents. <br /><br />I&#039;m pretty straight-edge with the exception of binge-drinking about once or twice a month, I like to think of myself as funny, and I most certainly didn&#039;t play football back in school. <br /><br />I&#039;m on Silk Road practically exclusively to buy handguns, since my country heavily restricts the civilian ownership of handguns, and I feel handguns to be necessary for the defense of myself and my family. Don&#039;t expect me to be buying any hand-cannons, I&#039;ve got to keep this kind of thing real low-key. I only see myself realistically buying guns with an eye for small size (less to hide, since it&#039;d be illegal) and low report (since I got to practice with it). Suppressors would be just aces if I could get my hands on any.<br /><br />Oh, and I drink Coca-Cola like a MOTHER.

				<br />Hello All!<br /><br />We are norcalking, and we are a new vendor to SR specializing in more herbal remedies :-)&nbsp; We have been in the medical marijuana industry for... oh.. about 2 years or so now. We are pleased to have this opportunity to ease your pain/ put smile on your face/ help relieve a little bit of life&#039;s stresses, or shit, just give you a good ol time. So far our experience as a vendor has been AWESOME! You all are so friendly and helpful, and true with your donations. Although we may never be able to see each others faces, it really does feel like a family. And for those of you who believe in the afterlife, we will be wearing norcalking name tags lol (green lettering with a blue background size 16 font /bold/ italic/ and underlined) you never know someone else might have the same name??? lol<br />The only thing we are new to is the SR site. Everything else is second nature. You will find that we are very fair, timely, and in most cases generous, because we understand compassion. We hope you will appreciate us as much as we appreciate you. We look forward to our time here and continuing to make you happy.&nbsp; We get up every morning looking forward to checking our page, or the forum just to see if we made someones day! We hope we can make yours!<br />Peace,<br /><br />NCK<br /><br />PS: Here is a link to our page below. <br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/2877098b49<br />

				Well, hello everyone. It&#039;s nice to meet you all. My name says NeuroRelativizer but that&#039;s a bit lengthy so feel free to shorten it however you like so long as I can tell you mean me. Neuro&#039;s the obvious shortcut but I have no doubt someone on here can come up with something more creative.<br /><br />My friend introduced me to SR some time ago, but for some reason I&#039;m just now getting around to initializing my forum presence. It really is a mystery, as I have a penchant for online community and I&#039;ve heard many good things about this one here. Not surprisingly, of course. Regardless of why it took so long as it has, I&#039;m glad to be here now and plan on becoming a familiar sight to all of you, and pleasantly so.<br /><br />I used to be quite naively gung-ho with drugs, and I&#039;m rather thankful I was never given the opportunity to dive into certain chemicals before I learned that some would not agree with me so well as those I know and love, meaning Mary, Lucy, Molly, and Dimitri. Well, for the most part - I&#039;ve met Sally (I don&#039;t know if anyone actually calls Salvia Sally but I was on a roll with the names) but we didn&#039;t have a good foundation to our preceding relationship so we didn&#039;t get along very well.<br /><br />Anyway, glad I finally spotted the intro topic, and I look forward to getting to know all of your online personae. Much love!

				G&#039;day from the land down under!<br /><br />I go by the name Mishrume (My shroom). As you can probably figure i love the little umbrellas that poke their heads out of the ground for only a few months of the year namely the &quot;subs&quot; variety as that&#039;s what we get over in my part of this sunburnt land.<br /><br />By far my biggest weakness tho is weed. I absolutely love the shit! I&#039;ve limited myself to only smoking on the weekends (in between jobs) now tho as continuous use over the last 11 years has done me no favours and the types of jobs i work require a D&amp;A during the medical process and random on site D&amp;A&#039;s. I wish things were different but ya can&#039;t have a high paying job and a high lifestyle it would seem :/ There are ways around it but i just can&#039;t be fucked running the gauntlet as we say and being paranoid as fuck that I&#039;ll get a random sprung on me and not know for sure that I&#039;ll pass so for the most part I&#039;m a good boy when I&#039;m working.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind synthetics but i don&#039;t go out of my way to find them. Had a good run with ice about 6 months ago and it was absolute top notch stuff. Big shards and pure as fuck pretty much delivered straight from the cook. My first blast of that shit (got shouted a pipe) kept me awake from Friday thru Sunday and from then on for a half dozen weekends or so i was buying stupid amounts and it never disappointed. I decided that was enough tho because i was getting pretty scatbrained from it and ppl were starting to notice.<br /><br />LSD however i do love! but unfortunately it is hard to come by in my part so it&#039;s much of a special treat when i do manage to procure a half dozen tabs or so. I could shift that shit like candy which is one of the main reasons i joined up on SR but financially am unable to do anything about that atm so I&#039;ll just have to settle for licking pictures of blotter on the screen and reminiscing about past fun times with Lucy.<br /><br />Coke. Seen an 8b of it once but never tried any. The bloke who had it was saving it for a special occasion (Prick!) and didn&#039;t want to sample any out to me :( Lately I&#039;ve been having recurring dreams about snorting copious amounts of the shit, like stupid stupid amounts piled on the table and me stuffing as much up my nose as humanly capable like ya see in parody vids so i guess the candy shop is subconsciously calling my name?? <br /><br />Speed. GTFO.. nobody uses it anymore but it was my first hard drug that i tried and i have no interest in it. Maybe that was due to the fact that i was add and done my fair share of tweaking at school.<br /><br />Heroin. Never tried it and i have no interest in doing so.<br /><br />Ecstacy. Meh.. I used to have a love affair with it years ago and it broke up a relationship. I stopped using x after the breakup but mainly because i didn&#039;t like paying $50 for caffeine loaded shit.. So I&#039;m interested in pursuing straight up MDMA now that it is within my grasp somewhat.<br /><br />Anyways enough dribbling shit about myself.<br /><br />I&#039;m here to meet like minded peeps and have fun in the process. So if you feel that we could do business or just share info and opinions then by all means drop me a line. I&#039;ve been lurking the forums, SR and TA for about a week now and i can already see a few vendors that I&#039;m sure i could trust. On that note, I&#039;m still researching the whole bitcoin thing and am not ready to commit yet but rest assured i will once i nut it all out.<br /><br />For now, peace out!<br /><br />Shrume<br /><br />P.s i run the handle Mishrume on SR and TA so you can be assured it&#039;s me.

				Just wanted to introduce myself. I have been lurking for a while and all the information gained from the helpful posts made my first transactions go through very smoothly. Call me crazy paranoid but I hate to give much details, what I will say I thoroughly enjoy good cannabis -- I would rather have nothing than crap some people call weed. I&#039;ve traveled the world and smoked the finest buds and I find SR to be more discrete and convenient than other purchase options. Sure it was cool the first few times to buy at a dispensary with a credit card -- but I got to thinking I really don&#039;t want a record of that sort of purchase when chances are at the rate we are going it&#039;s a record that will be kept forever.

				Hi everyone! I&#039;m OneAteSadness. I love raves, eating, exploring my mind&#039;s potential, and playing music. I have been clean for 3 months. Haha just kidding. Nice to meet you all. I look forward to doing business with you :) (aka, buying massive amounts of drugs) ...wait did I just say that? Who am I kidding, I&#039;m not a druggie, I&#039;m just here to buy some nice...shirts...and stuff. No but really, it&#039;s nice to have finally found SR. I can definitely see some crazy adventures in the future. :D

				Hi,<br /><br />Forgive me for my blank posts earlier. As you&#039;ve probably seen by now my username is Whothefuckisthis. I&#039;m just a regular guy like most of the other people&#039;s post I&#039;ve read. Just mostly working, trying to get back in school, and be anonnymous and safe while surfing the web. I&#039;ve known of Tor for a while but when I found out about silk road my head almost exploded. Anyway hoping to major in biochem one day and maybe a lil shop on SR. Here&#039;s to the future folks.

Did I mention that? <br /><br />I love edibles, but pretty much hate making them myself. That&#039;s one aspect that makes this place attractive to me. If anyone knows of vendors with awesome edibles, I&#039;d me much appreciated if you told me.<br /><br />Loving the shit up in here, and I&#039;m looking forward to being here on SR.<br /><br />Regards, <br />182Mexicans

				Hi people,<br /><br />I am fairly new to the site and delighted to be part of it now. I&#039;m big into music and festivals. My taste is fairly eclectic and i&#039;d listen to many genres. When it comes to drugs, I love MDMA and LSD. I came on here in search of good value LSD, but alas, in my opinion, it is the only thing on here that is severely over priced. That won&#039;t upset me though, as I will be rolling on MDMA at very good prices from now on, so I am delighted.<br /><br />This is the website that I have been looking for, for the last few years. I joined a few weeks ago and I really like the atmosphere on here. The people seem friendly on the forums and my experience with the vendors has been top notch. Many mainstream organizations could do with taking lessons in Customer Service from some of the vendors on here.<br /><br />Over and out,<br /><br />Psy

				Hello everybody,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member for a few months now but I&#039;ve never participated in the community forum. Currently I&#039;m studying so I have a very low budget which is why I am unable to buy all the stuff I want. I&#039;ve registered in the first place to try MXE. I&#039;m generally cautious when it comes to synthetic drugs which is why I&#039;ve chosen this place. Also I&#039;m very paranoid which is why I intend to order only domestic where it&#039;s 100% safe in my country. MXE was an exception and everything went out well. I&#039;m diagnosed with MDD and thought that I&#039;d give MXE a shot, it has been good for a few months until a little incident where I kinda overdosed unintentionally. So I lay it low for a while. I&#039;m a passionate weed smoker but since the new laws in Holland all of my hookups are out of stock. However I&#039;ve just started growing weed (I still live at home but my parents are cool with it) and I&#039;m excited how it will turn out. I intend to buy MDMA and in a few months I&#039;d like to try LSD. I probably have ADHD, too, since Speed isn&#039;t working for me (and several other reasons). And I LOVE progressive Rock. What else is there to say? Nobody will read it anyway :P<br /><br />Sincerely

			<dd class="postbody">
				My name is Saccovan after the 2 Italian anarchists Ferdinand Sacco and Bart Vanzetti which implies something about my personal views on the justice system.&nbsp; I am a retired computer security specialist and somewhat semi-famous hacker and member of a well known full disclosure group that published many exploits for UNIX systems back in the early to late 90&#039;s.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t ask me to crack a website or exploits but I can give you some advice if you have a reasonable query.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m an anarchist through and through and I am very much happy that something like SilkRoad and BMR exist to connect people who have something to offer and responsible individuals who know the difference between legality and morality (i.e. just because something is illegal doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s immoral and just because something is legal doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s moral).&nbsp; Sites like these and hidden links is the ultimate form of civil disobedience. <br /><br />I also dabble in organic and inorganic chemistry, permaculture, sustainability, and off the grid living. I&#039;m looking for interesting people to have productive discussions and hopefully I can share some of my wisdom to others.

				I&#039;m here for the LSD mainly.......I&#039;m a bit older and have grown out of most of the drug scene.....but I make the exception for LSD; which is a medicine and not a drug IMO....This I use to gain spiritual insight. <br /><br />Just quickly I believe there is a direct correlation between the movement towards world peace/a greater brotherhood of man and the world supply of LSD i.e&nbsp; the 1960s.&nbsp; Currently good quality LSD the world over is in short supply....It&#039;s much harder to get precursor chemicals today then it was back in the day..

				I like reading through these introductions. Gives the place a bit more of a community feel! I&#039;m new here. Scared / excited / feeling exposed. It&#039;s a veritable gauntlet from the moment you proceed to buying those bitcoins and then proceeding to read volumes of text to make yourself au fait with how to operate in here. My drug of choice is Adderall which is hard enough to find in EU. Not really interested in much else. I hope that with time, we can make the Silk Road a safer place for buyer and seller, because at the moment it still seems financially risky. I&#039;ve just made my first purchase today and I&#039;m praying it&#039;s not going to be money down the drain!<br />Peace

				&nbsp;8)<br />HI, I&#039;m californialove. Found my way to SR a while ago through work gossip and have bee&nbsp; spectating for a while. Thought its time to get in instead of sitting on the sidelines. Very excited about the future and the prospects of sites like SR. I find it all fascinating and a bit scary at the same time (e.g. the armory...? I like the idea of getting bud and pills annonymously through the mail, but worries me a bit that my neighbour might be able to get an assault rifle the same way). Really do think this site is the first in a line of game-changers that are coming soon and that LEA won&#039;t really be able to watch and enforce in any sufficient capacity. <br /><br />Also waaay safer and more convenient than waiting on a dark street corner for Sketchy Mcflakesalot to eventually turn up with some rip-off underweight shit.

				Hello,<br /><br />I am a new seller on SR. I am just starting out so my prices are a little cheaper than the rest(please don&#039;t hate me). My products are MDMA and LSD, they are always of the best quality. I can get other things if anyone is interested, just message me. Also I have alot of contacts within the scene here in NL so generally I know the strength of most pills or trips, and also if there are any bad batches going around(like at the moment some K is being sold here which is not K, it is closer to PCP, so be aware). So if anyone has questions or queries about some products of mine or not from me feel free to ask..<br /><br />Albionessentialols

				As of right now i&#039;ve been lurking the last month or so finding reputable dealers and checking out the prices to expect to pay. I love Mary Jane, but am in the market for hash since marijuana is easily obtained locally (gotta support the locals). But i love drugs. Not really into uppers mainly downers and hallucinogens. And since the local market doesn&#039;t offer a wide variety of hallucinogens that is how i was able to find SR. I would love to hear your suggestions of what to try and what not to try and who to try from. So In short I&#039;m here as a consumer feel free to message me. I&#039;d love to hear from you.

				Greetings Folks,<br /><br />Well after a fair amount of trials and tribulations I am this close [---] to having everything sorted and ready to put in my first few orders. After negotiating the ins and outs or SR, GPG keychain access, bitcoins, ewallets, tormail and everything else, I&#039;m waiting on a last clarification from Jeremy at SpendBitCoins then I&#039;ll be depositing and ordering away. Thanks to all for all the forum discussions that have steered me in the right direction and looking forward to having a chat myself at some stage with you all.<br /><br />Finally, love the idea of SR, I&#039;m a responsible adult, have a respectable job and am very safety conscious but to have to resort to purchasing our wares online is really extreme in this day of &#039;freedom&#039; and &#039;liberation&#039;. After all, if I cant decide whats right for me then where does that leave me as a reasonable respectable adult in this day and age. <br /><br />Saying that, if I hadn&#039;t have left my home to move to the big smoke to start a new career I probably wouldn&#039;t need the site, but it can be difficult and slightly edgy to find a reputable DD that I&#039;d feel comfortable around in a new town.<br /><br />Looking forward to meeting you all.

I love the thought of SR, I still am wary and have a lot to learn. I hope everything goes well and I can continue making purchases here for months to come if not years. <br />I like the outdoors, music festivals, fishing, exploring nature and my mind. I play a lot of video games, and I smoke a ton of herb. I dwindle in everything but treat everything with caution.

I also feel LE&#039;s structure and policies are responsible for this situation, putting countless lives in danger and directing money to the hands of the real criminals.<br />&nbsp;<br />I am grateful for this opportunity where I can continue to expand my experiences, with a much more acceptable risk.<br />THANK YOU SR VENDORS!!!!<br />- Jesse<br />&nbsp;aka Pew-pills-brethren

				Hello SR folks!!!!!&nbsp; New member here. Couple moths ago i joined and was gonna place an order with Tony. Luckily before i did he went MIA(sucks for others) so I decided to wait til got the feel for the system. Placed 2 orders so far and to my dismay have got no responses and now my coins are tied up. I am a VERY easy going guy that has spent the better part of 20 yrs usin my body as a pin cushion. Lots of stories and blessed with gift to make others laugh. I don&#039;t say alot unless trying to make others laugh or feel like i&#039;m getting ignored. Using a different forum name at first til i get to know folks some.(just cautious). Hopefully will have good experiences here but looks like might start 0 for 2.&nbsp; See ya around the road

				&nbsp;Hi<br /><br />I&#039;m new to SR and will be buying under the names CnutFinger75(my friends account currently as I forgot my PIN) and perroviejo.<br />I have a passion for opiates and cocaine in particular, but am partial to many other novel compounds, but most of my 30+ yrs of experience have been with the wife (heroin) and the girlfriend (coke)!<br /><br />I have made a 3 test purchases with some reputable vendors and had to agree to FE as part of their conditions. Although I did not want to do this, there was little choice for me if i wanted to buy from vendors with good feedback that carried the products that I wanted within the EU. I hope everything goes smooth as i just want to do honest business with reliable vendors.<br /><br />I will be sure to update my feedback and leave a review reflecting the service that I receive from these vendors.<br /><br />perroviejo<br />

				Sup? You can call me burned man... it fits me perfectly as a nickname for many reasons but I won&#039;t go into them. I have joined SR just yesterday and I feel like I have A LOT to contribute to this wonderful community! This is because I live somewhere where I&#039;m able to obtain high quality pharmaceuticals (generics) in potentially unlimited quantities, offering such low prices which will probably make you doubt my integrity... the thing is, I have not yet started selling because of all the hassle of getting a credit card and exchanging money for bitcoins, etc. I&#039;m also inexperienced with shipping and methods but with a little help I could become one of the best vendors on SR in a short time, as soon as I set up! Cheers!

				what&#039;s up guys. i&#039;m bdun19, a new member. I&#039;m close to the philly area in the US and I accidentally stumbled upon SR while looking for ways to find new connections. I recently moved to this place, so I don&#039;t have any of the old familiar people to turn to anymore. I&#039;ve done about everything under the sun, but my fav is speedballs. So i would like to find someone domestic who can offer coke and h at the same time. I have to familiarize myself with the whole bitcoin thing, it looks like it&#039;s going to be a pain in the ass. Any suggestions on legit vendors who can provide me with those would be appreciated. Also if anyone lives near my area i am willing to meet in person and take all the risk or whatever if you have a good reputation. I would love to have a place to go when i don&#039;t wanna wait a few days-weeks for the product to arrive, but i&#039;m not sure where to post that will get anyone&#039;s attention. anyway i love the site and keep up the great job guys.

				Hello SR. I recently became a member and I have to see this place is beyond legendary. I have a IT background so if anyone has any questions I will do my best to help out but to be honest the forums are amazing read and you will find. I decided to try taking the High Road because it&#039;s hard to find quality product and people who give a damn about it. Friends/buddies are welcome just ask. Before I joined the forum I thought this place was just a Druggies dream webpage(kinda still is) but there is more to it. Hat&#039;s off to the people who protect SR and the community. I can&#039;t even imagine the work that goes into this place. Maybe in the near future I could contribute my help to the cause. My SR and forum name are the same. Looking forward to getting to know some of you. I plan on just being a buyer. I look forward to meeting folks, cutting up, and getting my buzz on. That&#039;s all for now.

				Hey all!<br /><br />I found this website through a friend and so far I love it! I&#039;ve made one purchase on here for my favorite chemical which happens to be ketamine :) - the seller was so helpful and had great customer care skills. I&#039;m really into my&nbsp; dissociatives and ecstacy but becoming more and more interested into psychedelics (I plan on trying 2-CB soon). I&#039;m currently a student studying IT which is okay I suppose (it&#039;s more software based and I had hoped for it to be more hardware based).<br /><br />I am majorly impressed with the place by the honesty and kindness of people :)

				I&#039;m two3. I just joined this site today although I&#039;ve been reading about it online for about a week now. I&#039;ve done my research on bitcoins and all this seems attractive to me. Its always been my dream to be one of the great criminals in this world. I&#039;m the guy who roots for the bad guys n movies, I watch &quot;american greed&quot; on cnbc religiously...I&#039;m not much into drugs unless its making money. but I want to be the greatest con artist ever. My heroes include Bernie madoff, frank abignale, Albert talton and many more...Im fasinated with cc scams, bank scams, pretty much any white collar crime. I&#039;ve tried my hand in fake money but I haven&#039;t completly mastered the art YET. Pimping women on backpage is also a quick hustle I love... Finding this site is a dream come true. I hope to meet like minded individuals here with the same ambitions as me...I never want to see prison but if I go, I want to go for being a criminal mastermind...

				Hey everyone! I am pantman500, and I am excited to be part of this legitimate community. All I really have to say is that vendors: VICODIN, NATASHA, and POUNDSIGN have been good to me. Also a question: I want to order UnderGroundSyndicate&#039;s 30mg Oxys, and Ive heard good things about him with weed and BTC and whatnot but has anyone ordered/tried his 30mg Oxys?? they are a great price and I want to order and he seems super legit regarding the buzz on his other services but just wanted to see if anyone has tried them?? Let me know!!<br /><br />Peace

Now I&#039;m willing to give it another shot, and seeing so many positive voices confirms that I&#039;m making a (subjectively) good choice.

				Hi everyone, I&#039;m DrGonzo666. I discovered SR because of the Gawker article. My drug(s) of choice are good ole&#039; fashioned opiates/painkillers. I&#039;m from the southeastern US state that is famous for prosecuting pain doctors and patients. I&#039;ve been looking for a safe alternative to street buying since the crackdown began. This is truly an incredible place! I&#039;ve just been kinda&#039; looking around and trying to learn the ropes the past few days. I hope to make my first purchase next week after I&#039;ve had a chance to get some BTC&#039;s. Any advice for new buyers would be greatly appreciated. I&#039;ve also read the very well written tutorial on PGP/GPG that shepj posted. Looking forward to a long and happy relationship with SR and it&#039;s members. As far as bringing something to the table, I&#039;m a 25 year veteran of both the automotive repair industry and the commercial trucking industry. Hey, everybody&#039;s car breaks down, right? So...

				Hello and happy Sunday Funday to everyone! My name is ******. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA playing baseball and basketball my whole life until I found a new passion, drugs.&nbsp; I have had a lot of experience with drugs. I have experimented, been addicted to, seen people addicted, and seen people die from lots of drugs. I have lost many close friends to overdoses, but I still am here. The SilkRoad, to me, is more than just a community to sell drugs and discuss anything else illegal.&nbsp; The SilkRoad IMO is a revolution in the making! I see all the people on here who have the same views as me, maybe not with everything, but definitely in the way that our governments do not own us! I love to talk, but I will keep this message brief. If you ever would like to get to know me anymore or anything, drop me a line! PM here or on the SR. same username! I am also located in Salt Lake City, UT. So anyone in the surrounding areas, drop me a line!!! Hit me up in CO, NV, CA!!!!

				Hey SR,<br /><br />Canadian teenager here. So turns out the idiots at my high school think its a good idea to lace marijuana with whole bunch rubbish. It&#039;s probably the worst weed in the country and fortunately because I&#039;m not a complete idiot, I know that I can get high quality stuff from other sources such as Silk Road. Excited to see what SR has to offer. I&#039;m intrigued by drug usage but I&#039;m an advocate for the proper responsibility and use of drugs. I&#039;m top in my class in terms of High School performance, plan on MIT or UofT for university in a year. Should be sweet.<br /><br />Also planning on giving LSD a try at some point. Just have to see if my buddy wants to take of me so I don&#039;t run in the middle of traffic. :P<br /><br />Cheers!

Most of my experiences are with hallucinogens, of which I enjoy MDMA and Mushrooms the most... but most of all i would LOVE to try some REAL cocaine.

				Hi Folks!<br /><br />My name is DrWhite (or you can call me &quot;DOC&quot; as some have appropriately nicknamed me) I am fairly new to SR ~ 2 mos. now. I like many others on here have had negative experiences with online pharmacies. 99% are scams so don&#039;t think you are that lucky. I have sold a variety of products in real life for almost 10 years now so I feel I am well experienced with drugs and the drug game.. SR and bitcoin however was completely new to me and threw me on a steep learning curve. I am still working out the kinks but am figuring it out thanks to the helpfulness and advise of kind people here on SR. As a vendor I would like to contribute to SR and what it stands for with excellent products, customer service and careful maneuvering as well as virtually untraceable stealth methods.<br /><br />Currently I sell commercial/regular quality weed but am planning on expanding to some other products as well. Take a look at my listings here:<br /><br />1&nbsp; OZ- http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/9b3b52de63<br />2 OZ-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/34d5ef932d<br />4 OZ-http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/323762b276<br /><br />I will do larger amounts but not with everyone and never on a first order.<br /><br />I am working very hard to cultivate great relationships with vendors and buyers alike here on SR. I look forward to providing a discreet and reliable service to my customers for as long as possible.<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br /><br />DrWhite&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I am a poet and artist as well as writer of some formal articles in media theory. Professionally I am involved in film making. I have served in the Peace Corps. <br /><br />I am here for the drugs- the LSD, shrooms, psilacetin, Winstrol, Dunhill Reds, heroin, 25x&#039;s, Mescaline, Ketamine, 3-Meo-PCP, DMT, and amphetamines. I have lots of drugs subsequent to discovering SR. Before SR, I only periodically had pathetically minute quantities of drugs. <br /><br />I spend most of my free time away from working in any of my respective fields reading. Aside from that, I am otherwise high, whether for recreational, spiritual, or psychotherapeutic purposes. I LOVE IT! <br /><br />

This name means a lot to me, I choose it because of my deep connection with cats, and how I love to give them pleasure.<br />Okay.. I just choose this name because there was a pack of catcandy next to my laptop while I was making this account (yes, I have the creativity of a goldfish when I&#039;m sober). <br />I&#039;m a student in philosophy and love IDM/progressive techno and the drugs associated with that scene ;).

				Hi all! Thought I&#039;d pop my forum cherry in a thread that no one ever reads... heh.<br /><br />I&#039;m a pretty normal (read:boring) person if you ignore the fact that I have an insatiable desire to try every substance known to man. I&#039;ve wasted hours just ogling the listings here. Encrypting messages makes me feel like a secret agent, but unfortunately I&#039;m not actually a secret agent. Or even an agent.

				Hey all, I&#039;m Lucyd&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent the past month basically trying to pick my jaw up off the ground as a result of discovering Silk Road - beyond impressed/grateful/amazed/euphoric at the mere fact that such a fine establishment is in existence.<br /><br />I&#039;m a psychology student from Australia and really here for the LSD. I want to find quality psychedelics that will enhance the exploration of the depths of my mind. I&#039;ve been slightly disillusioned with the acid I&#039;ve been getting of late, so hoping to fix that.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to flip a coin to decide whether home or work address will be used for my very first order (after lurking these forums for another couple of hours for advice of course) as decision making has proven hard..<br /><br />Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity.<br /><br />Lucyd&nbsp; :D

				This is the Pit Mistress coming to you from the fiery pits...bahaha, not really, but it was a good try. Anyway, after some Googling and what-not, I stumbled upon SR. I&#039;m serious sick of these little thug ripoffs around here that don&#039;t know how to weigh a fucking bag, so I am hoping to find a new breed of vendor on SR. I may be new to SR, but I&#039;m far from a &quot;noob&quot; to all of this, it just took me a while to even consider that something like this existed. So, yeah, that&#039;s me, see you guys on the forums. Stay up, metalheads \m/

				My name is solidsnake66 but you can call me Snake for short.<br /><br />I have been a IT systems administrator for almost 6 years now. I like to tinker with things especially anything electronic or mechanical (computers and cars mostly).<br /><br />I have been a middle man for deals in my area for a while but am tired of the BS and sketchy people that comes with it, so I&#039;ve become a cultivator specifically of various strains of mushrooms. I plan to primarily deal with those on the site once my next harvest comes, although depending on how things go with my past connections I may provide some other goods as well.<br /><br />I also like to partake myself, although obtaining a lot of substances is difficult from my location and is usually very sketchy so I will probably also be looking to buy from here as well.<br /><br />Any suggestions or questions are welcome, just don&#039;t expect an answer right away as I only connect from public wifi locations.

				Hello, people of SilkRoad, My name is Sykness and I am new to the site and all of it&#039;s awesome qualities. From my understanding, Silkroad works as a system of rating, being a good buyer and also being a good vendor, and although I have not had either happen in my time being a member on Silkroad, I want to get in touch with the community because I want to be trusted. For what you may ask, well I see how some people become vendors on the site and earn extra or even make their living from doing so. I am currently a &quot;Street&quot; Vendor which before SilkRoad you all had to deal with those people, but I want to become more. I want to become a top ranked Vendor of SilkRoad and have the credability as some of the other top ranked. As of now I am still a non-seller account but not for long. In the next week I will upgrade my account and attempt to also become a successful Vendor. Mostly consisting of Cannabis or &quot;Marijiuana&quot; but not entirely. I have some fair prices in mind for when all that starts to happen, but what I want right now is to reach out to the community on the forum get to talk to people and see if I can gain some customers. If you&#039;re reading this and saying to yourself &quot;Wow &quot;cool story bro&quot; I would have to say it&#039;s the truth and I don&#039;t have much else right now other than my word. So please get in touch if you seem intersted in me as a choice for a Vendor, I want to get people what they want. That way it satisfies the both Vendor and buyer.

I&#039;ve only done any drugs for about 9 months, and up until the last few, its been K2 and pills and shit. I actually came across this place trying to find some acid, to kinda broaden my horizons.

				Hi my alias is Imaginarytailus13. I`ve have joined the community to sell my wares and do research. I will be upgrading my account to be a seller tomorrow. I will mainly be selling medical supplies, food and art-related products.<br />I`m not the person to go to for drugs, weapons or any other goods than the ones I have listed above. I`m not closed minded, and do take a few drugs myself, but I won`t be selling because where I live the laws/regulations of any drug/etc is tight, the prices ky-high and will land me in decades of solitary confinement. I like researching and asking stuff in general, I like writing, playing guitar/bass as well as learning about different countries. I hope to find a place in the community here and work something out.

I just moved, I really don&#039;t know anyone around my city so I&#039;ll prolly be on this forum a lot. <br /><br />I started college a little late but I&#039;m almost done with an associate degree and I&#039;m aspiring to become an attorney. Looking to build a good rep here so pm if you guys have anything to discuss about what you guys know about me so far, see ya around.

				Hello All!<br /><br />I&#039;m a business man! I frequent many festivals and have a few legitimate medical connections. Many of the items I offer were purchased or traded through festivals. No worries though; I always chemical test, and personal test, to rate each item. I consider myself particularly experienced and so I write my reviews as honestly and accurately as I can based on my many previous encounters.&nbsp; You may always contact me with any questions of any items I have for sale.<br />I also obtain various legitimate pharmaceuticals as well; mainly uppers.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to get to know many of you and am excited to develop lasting business relationships!<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Hi, I&#039;m sourpatchkid! I first learned of SR through the Gawker article like many others. Around this time, I had just experienced my first trip on psychedelics (magic mushrooms). I was desperate for this amazing and beautiful experience again, however, there is not a reliable supply of psychedelics in my area (I lucked up with the shrooms). So, once I learned of SR, I decided to check it out. I hung around for a month or two just gazing at all the listings before making my first purchase (GoldieLox&#039;s LSD). I made my forum account later to review this awesome vendor. I hope to soon become an established buyer and forum member. I believe in SR and want to offer positive support for this community. <br /><br /><br />As for my drugs of choice--marijuana and psychedelics solely.

				Hey, everyone! I was having a glass of wine when trying to come up with a username, so it came pretty naturally. <br /><br />I&#039;ve known about Tor for awhile, but never bothered to use it under the assumption that it was just child porn and poor websites with no funding. My girlfriend asked me if I was familiar with Silk Road, and after days and days of research, countless how-to guides and lots of consultation with a friend who majored in Computer Science, I found myself here, and I can&#039;t express how impressed I am with the community. The programming, the privacy, the state of mind most users have, it&#039;s all impressed me so much. After lurking for the past little while, I thought I should take the next step and try to get involved with the community, contribute to the forums where I can, and support the vendors. <br /><br />Thank you to the mods and admins who do an incredible job at keeping this place going. I&#039;m going to be making my first purchase soon, and I want to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible, so you&#039;ll likely see me around the forums a fair amount in the next little while asking silly n00b questions. Thanks for putting up with me as I get more familiar with everything. <br /><br />Oh, and I&#039;m here to find some things that aren&#039;t easy when you live in a small town like I do. I&#039;ve experimented a bit here and there, but haven&#039;t done anything to the point of danger. Very casual MDMA user about once a month when I go out, tried LSD once with my girlfriend as a sitter, a bump of coke here and there. I treat drugs like a buffet, and I want a small taste of everything at one point or another. <br /><br />Thanks again, Silk Road! You&#039;re MDMAzing!

				Hello SR family, I&#039;m Drksdfmn138. Thats a mixture of Dark Side of the Moon with out vowels and the Misfits We are 138. I came to the SR because of a buddy of mine, We&#039;re both interested in making the most out of our freedom and believe its our choice to use our hard earned money as we please. Bitcoins are the future! Anyways I was purchasing with him for awhile but I had to move so I started up my own account and have been enjoying it thoroughly. I&#039;ve talked with so many nice people (and a few trolls). But I mainly use this site to help me find the medicine I need. I&#039;m a car wreck survivor and I deal with chronic pain everyday. Mainly strong cannabis and sometimes opiates... Some days its a must for opiates as i have metal strewn throughout my body and that shit hurts like nobody&#039;s business. But as I cannot work, I enjoy being able to talk with people here on the forums and always hunting for great deals on pain relieving strains and phenos. I take care of my great grandmother to keep her out of a nursing home. Also my grandfather has Parkinson&#039;s so when his meds stopped working, i introduced him to cannabis to help his shakes and pains. I really feel that since i&#039;m still alive after my car accident, I&#039;m here to help people on this earth deal with pain and suffering. Something I&#039;ve come to know quite well. I am a happy person though sometimes its hard to not let the pain in my legs get the best of me. But I do my best to exercise and eat right, as well as use meds sparingly when I need them. Music helps me out alot, always seems to lift my mood and spirit. So anyways enough of that.. Thanx SR members for welcoming me to your community. Long days and pleasant nights!

				Oh hey I didn&#039;t see this thread. I guess I should drop a quick &quot;hello&quot; here. I&#039;d heard about Silk Road for a few years now but never really even entertained the notion of trying to become an active participant as I am NOT computer savvy in the least. I finally gave it a shot, and I&#039;ve at least MADE it ashore, but I&#039;m still not 100% about everything else. I am poring over all the Wikis and step-by-step posts and anything else I can get my hands on. <br /><br />Anyway, I plan on shopping SR like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless. This place is the coolest fucking thing of all time.

				gonzorx here. I am both buyer and seller under different account names (security, sorry... trust nobody and all...) and use this account to be myself rather than an ass kissing buyer or selective scamming vendor without fear of reprisal ;-)<br /><br />SR has been hit and miss for me. For the stuff I like, I can source it better quality and cheaper locally. I thought it might be good for products like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine which are in low supply / bad quality in my local black market. This has definitely not been the case unfortunately! Seems like everybody has the same rubbish in every country with a different price tag. SR could effectively normalize world prices which would be interesting. I get a lot of flack for being so forthright but know that the cynical (reads: realistic) people amongst us will agree with my statements. <br /><br />After blowing a lot of cash on this site, this is what I have noticed in terms of good deals (good price, good quality). <br /><br />SR drug pros: dmt, lsd, psylo, 2c-b, lsd, mephedrone, mdma, mda, mescaline, amphetamine sulphate, quality hash (probably any other psychedelic variant) <br />SR drug cons: the stuff everybody wants: cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin <br /><br />Good project though. I like the potential altruism of keeping violent crime out of drug consumption. Something that should have ended after Alexander The Great! <br /><br />good luck<br />

				Hey guys. Not really a druggie here. I just love hallucinogens.<br /><br />Really, really love hallucinogens. I do everything better when I&#039;m under their influence - whether it be playing a musical instrument, writing, even doing coursework. LOL<br /><br />I like Lucy more than shrooms, which I like more than nearly anything else I&#039;ve had. I&#039;ve had a bunch of stuff and the only things I&#039;ll never try are hard opiates. They say DMT is nice...

But moving on... I thoroughly hope next experiences will be of joy on SR.&nbsp; I am going to be a vendor soon and will be selling the best Mescaline HCL that SR has at the reasonable price of 90usd/gbp/euros (depending on your location) in relative BTC value of course. I look forward to getting you all very, very, very, sparkly and neon colored very soon :)<br /><br />Things I like: Growing shrooms, creative writing, eating LSD in the woods, rampant shagging on MDMA, and everything else beautiful about life that has nothing to do with substances other than air and water and fire and earth :)<br /><br />Peace and love

				How&#039;s it going everyone?! I&#039;m ThreeShoes. I&#039;m a college student and a huge Mixed Martial Arts fanatic. I work full time and am on summer break from college. I discovered SR by hearing people talk about it online. At first it seemed like a crock of shit, but after browsing around it seems to be a legitimate site. I&#039;ve yet to buy anything, but I&#039;m very excited to make my first marijuana purchase. The weed that is available in my area isn&#039;t very high grade, but from what I&#039;ve seen here it seems as if there are some potent products available. Have a good day, folks.

				Hey all. I learned about SR looooooong ago, but I never had reason to use it. THEN, I went to Camp Bisco 11 (fucking awesome sets, even Bassnecter powered through his technical problems), and used some wonderful shit that apparently I can&#039;t get around where I live. <br /><br />So I figured, I love Amazon, let&#039;s use the internet for everything and be extra lazy.

				Hey everyone! <br /><br />My name is TheStateOfMind,<br /><br />I have had many wonderful experiences using SR the past couple of months, but I never got a chance to introduce myself. So here it is: <br />I am a professional jazz pianist and consider myself somewhat of a psychonaut. There is nothing more intriguing<br />to me than the explorations of the subconscious, or as I like to call it &quot;The Explorations Of The State Of Mind&quot;. <br />I love taking hallucinogens by myself, that includes my favorite psychedelic LSD and the world&#039;s most amazing <br />creation, DMT. I am very thankful for being a part of this community and would like to thank all the amazing <br />vendors that risk everything to bring and share with us their amazing products. The quality of everything on here is<br />absolutely amazing and mind-blowing. I cannot wait to try more of the goods that are available now and in the near<br />future. I am always open to talk about hallucinogens, music, or anything! So just PM me 8) <br /><br />Peace,<br />TheStateOfMind<br /><br />

				Greetings to the SR community.<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m NewYorkFatCap from the UK. Have been on here a week now and feel honored to have discovered this wonderful place called &#039;SR&#039; I have done nothing but learn, having been trawling these forums for a week now; so much to digest! So moreish !<br />&nbsp;I can now encrypt my mails, browse anonymously, basically i feel that I learned more this week about computers and their uses than in the rest of my life. I had no idea, I was only trying to find a way onto piratebay and then I discovered tor. I had no idea of darknet. No wonder its kept hush hush. Surprised at the blatan links tot child abuse sites, really quite disturbing. I suppose that is the price of free speech, you can&#039;t approve of it all. Still very wrong though.<br />&nbsp;Have been in the herbal trade for 20 yrs now ( done well, never caught or suspected ) and will soon be setting up a small sellers account ( under diff. name of course ! ) for the UK market to see how things go.<br />&nbsp;I doff my cap to DPR and all the rest of the community,<br />Look forward to banter and advice in the forums,<br />Peace and love always,<br />NYFC. 8)

				Hi.&nbsp; I just discovered this particular thread. I&#039;m in my 50&#039;s.&nbsp; I work several part time jobs while in the process of trying to start a business.&nbsp; I&#039;m a bit hesitant to go into any more detail than that only because I meet many people in my work and any one of them could be an SR member and might recognize who I am.&nbsp; Suffice it to say they&#039;re just normal occupations.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am a light pot smoker now.&nbsp; I partied a lot when I was younger and did small recreational doses of psychedelics.&nbsp; I recently became interested in using LSD for the purpose of ego death but can&#039;t find it where I live.&nbsp; Then I discovered SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been gradually taking increased dosages and reading a lot about ego death.&nbsp; I still haven&#039;t achieved it yet but I have experienced various degrees of ego loss.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now that I&#039;ve read more about ego death and it&#039;s possible after effects (and after noticing the after effects of my last trip) I&#039;ve decided that I need to hold off on that goal for awhile until I get the practicalities of my life better situated but I&#039;m still shopping on here to build up a little stash for later when I&#039;m ready to pursue that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Like many other members I&#039;ve had both good and bad purchasing experiences on SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely a very beneficial site and I hope it can continue.&nbsp; <br />And the forums are very helpful with so many good spirited people sharing their knowledge. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br /><br />

				Just a new member from Aus.<br /><br />Signed up to this site to buy from overseas as the MDMA and pills here, half are poison and the other half are duds.<br /><br />The police cracking down on MDMA and pills in our country are wasting time and resources.<br /><br />So many people I know have turned to meth because the pills have been really shit, and meth is a whole lot worse than decent MDMA.<br /><br />Also people have taken pills that have had other shit in them and have found themselves in hospital, myself included. <br /><br />Planning on buying small amounts of decent goods to essentially keep myself and my friends safe when we go out.<br /><br />People are not going to stop taking pills, but I just wished that the cops would see they are doing more harm than good cracking down on MDMA.<br /><br />Oh also, Hi everyone.

				Hi all, I found out about SR after browsing the hidden wiki. I actually visited the site many times but was too lazy to register, but once I did and saw what people sold I was quickly interested since I only know one person who currently smokes weed and he doesn&#039;t share, which is fine because I&#039;m more interested in edibles. It&#039;s been interesting learning about bitcoin, and I love browsing all the offerings trying to figure out what I&#039;m gonna get after my bills are paid.

I&#039;ll probably surf under the radar most of the time but every now and then I like to toss in a little input. I think all of our shared experience with mind altering substances will help make first timers here approach drugs in a safer way so if anybody feels interested but uncertain about psychadelics or stimulants, send me a message and I may have an answer.<br /><br />Rock on&nbsp; 8)

				Hey guys, bubbak here. I recently discovered this little corner of the web after a few years of using synthetic marijuana on and off. With that stuff, I was having some ill health effects and now it&#039;s all illegal anyway. That all sucks for me because as I get older, I don&#039;t know anyone with decent weed hookups, and the synthetic at first seemed like a godsend.<br /><br />Anyway, I just hope to keep myself and some close friends smoking. I&#039;m not out to profit off this or fuck anything up; I just like to smoke weed. Now I have to figure out PGP, bitcoin, etc. before I can get started. I&#039;m really glad to have found this place.

I&#039;m really interested to see how this Community is developing in its way of communication and the items being offered. Finally learned how to work with GNU and I hope there is a lot more out there.<br /><br />About stuff I might buy one day when I got this all figured out; That probably will be MDMA or XTC pills.

This is a pseudonym from my buyer account as i wasnt sure about forum security etc but i still intend to be active on the forums and contribute where i can.<br />Sudonym

				Hey what&#039;s up. I heard about SR and have spent the last couple weeks teaching myself Linux in order to be here. Kinda jazzed about that. SR was the perfect push for me to start learning it. I&#039;m into vaping cannabis. Wish I would&#039;ve got my hand-sized vape years ago. Besides that I&#039;m into computers, hiking, swimming, reading, music, etc. Peace everybody!

Some will accept you if you politely ask if you can purchase a small order with them. There are also vendors who will sell to you even if you&#039;re new because they ONLY work through escrow. My advise to you, don&#039;t finalize early ever. Unless you are certain the vendor is legit. I&#039;ve been lucky that I was able to order from good vendors that didn&#039;t require FE and I made good stats quickly. However I used respect and politeness, and always PM&#039;d my vendors first and asked permission to order. And always thank them in the forums and write good reviews of their wares.

				Hello I am new. I like tacos! I have known about silk road and finnally decided to take a stroll. Worst timing it seems as bitcoins are skyrocketing. I would love to get some more things than I already have, but I must wait and hope the value shoots up enough that I can buy much more with my little amount. If anyone wants to donate to me on the road as a new user I would be very grateful :D Than again wouldn&#039;t we all? Anyways look forward to my strolls on the road.

				Hey everyone,<br />My handle is jaythomas. I am fresh out of the USMC. I am new to SR, but have heard a lot about it. (I shied away from it until Uncle Sam wasn&#039;t up my ass every minute of my life. You&#039;re welcome for that by the way.) I have perused the site and its contents and the only conclusion I can come to is that this is fucking brilliant! As of yet I do not have any bit-coins but I plan on becoming a reputable merchant who can suit all of your needs. I enjoy drugs, weapons, sex, money and electronics. I am not too great with&nbsp; computers but I am self sufficient and still learning, (So don&#039;t be too cruel to me.) Plus, to be totally and completely honest the only reason I am here is to take advantage of the SR and build a namesake for myself to support my kin. I consider myself an artist. I like to smoke weed and do psychedelic drugs and make stop motion/claymation videos. I have a bunch of tattoos and I am in to dominating my anonymous female sex slaves and videotaping it in my love dungeon, if anyone wants in on the action let me know. I play guitar and do other things too. I like to think that I&#039;m a respectable businessman who can achieve all goals set in front of me and surpass all standards expected of me. If you don&#039;t believe me just give me a chance to show you. I look forward to conducting business with a lot of you as soon as I can get my funds situated correctly and learn the inner workings of the SR. If you would like to know anything else or just chat hit me up. I don&#039;t do anything all day but get high, play guitar, and sell illegal wares. <br />

				Hey folks! I&#039;m a writer who has been messing around in the online world since the days of Gopher and Fetch. I smoke weed for two reasons:&nbsp; I love getting high, yes, but it also helps control a medical condition whose symptoms are almost identical to Crohn&#039;s disease... and if you don&#039;t know what those symptoms are, don&#039;t look it up, just trust me that it&#039;s embarrassing and awful.

				Howdy folks - recreational chemist here, been lurking for a while, just made my first purchase - can&#039;t wait for it to come in the mail. This is a great resource - I am somewhat up in the air as to my position on anarcho-capitalism, i think that i might consider myself a minarchist? but it&#039;s wonderful to have access to a market where I can find the medications I use without having to deal with the ridiculous healthcare system. (I&#039;m not normally this political - in fact I&#039;m really just trying to get my head around the central concepts of some of the anti-statist positions that I&#039;ve seen come forward lately. If anyone would like to give me their .02 on this, please PM me or we can start a new thread in the appropriate board. I&#039;m not looking for heated discussion, i&#039;m looking for a friendly conversation- I&#039;m far from an ideologue, and I find conversing with ideologues generally tedious.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;m not a vendor and don&#039;t plan to be, but I&#039;m very interested in making my own DMT and particularly DMT infusions (changa). I&#039;ve done some DMT extractions from Mimosa, and infused the result into white B. Caapi with excellent results. Next steps are to start adding other herbs such as damiana to the mix to see what happens. Anyone with knowledge or interest in this type of thing, please get in touch as well. I&#039;m still wading through the forums, I know there is much to be learned there on this topic, but I&#039;m always looking to link up with fellow travelers.<br /><br />Also, I realize now that my handle looks like &quot;Sort 3d&quot; but I meant it to read as &quot;sorted&quot;. meh

I got out of the scene because of the apparent lack of moderation and the fact that it&#039;s full of so much grief (seen a lot of funerals and jail sentences) and I actually lead a pretty straight (I&#039;d never say normal) life... but mostly because the quality, availability is always so touch and go.<br />&nbsp; So I came to the road, lookin for a reliable source of good gear, without all the sad stuff and since my short time here, I have found a community, one of smart people with good morals and similar interests to myself.&nbsp; So I&#039;ve kept reading, researching and I&#039;ve learnt soooooo much about my computer, the internet and lots of other things that I always thought were possible, but never truly understood, I guess.<br />&nbsp; This site is great, thanks DPR and everybody else involved.&nbsp; I came lookin for so little, in retrospect, compared to what I have found here.&nbsp; I look forward to my future with SR and these forums, and thanks to anybody who actually went to the effort of reading this long arsed post, I know I ramble.&nbsp; jumpingBeans

				Hi, all<br /><br />Update.<br /><br />I am becoming more used to the SR main site, and I am gaining clarity in what I want out of SR. I don&#039;t spend time posting on these forums, so please let this serve as a notice to any concerned party, as I am not on here to build a reputation through posting. I am primarily focused on engaging in large purchases of Dutch/German MDMA &amp; E, along with some small personal USA purchases of all variety. I am a solution oriented person, and I plan to remain on SR for a long time. My interest is to build a reputation as a a buyer that vendors trust and want to deal with. I have been successful so far in maintaining great buyer stats, but it is possible that may change in the future, especially as the amount of my international orders increases - I presume there will be a growing likelihood of seizure, and other mishaps.<br /><br />The vendors that have dealt &amp; communicated with me know that I am communicative, polite, and courteous. <br /><br />I want to make every effort to satisfy the vendors on their end, and to build &amp; protect my reputation as an honest buyer.<br /><br />Vendors I have purchased from so far:<br />WestCoastRX<br />SpiritDoor<br />OCKing<br />USABeans<br />SuperTrips<br />BigBuff<br /><br /><br />I will mostly check the forums and my eMail on days when SR main site is down.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />infinteSeries

				Hello everyone. <br /><br />Long time lurker on the forums but I finally decided to take the plunge and make an actual account on here.&nbsp; Stuff I&#039;m interested in drug wise are magic mushrooms and good olde&#039; mary jane. Other interests without getting into too much detail include cryptography, electronics, and a few video games here and there :D.<br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s all I can think of for now. Keep on keepin&#039; on Silk Road.

				Hello,<br />&nbsp; Im Steno J. I made my name up looking at random objects in my room. Anything experimental intrigues me from drugs to music and what have you. I like video games of all types, indies are always fun. Eat pizza, read comics(more indies), and get high your way. Check out Chew if you get a chance, funny shit that relative to a lot of our barriers. I also don&#039;t want to continue detailing my interests with the paranoia of&nbsp; &#039;Personality Profiling - Are We Giving Away Too Much Personal Information? &#039; thread I&#039;ve read. Put on tin cap. Anyways, I hope I can review all the awesome vendors I come across and hopefully not have to shit on the scammers/ rip offs anytime in the future. Cheers to you travelers and thanks for this revolution. truly astonishing.

				Hi everyone, I joined SR approximately 1 month and am thoroughly enjoying the experience! <br />I live in the U.S, I love my wife and 2 children, my favorite pastime is snowboarding (I&#039;m heading to Chile in a week to snowboard in the Andes), my favorite drugs are mdma, mda, lsd &amp; dmt.<br />I have 32 years of experience with drugs and cocaine is the only one I cannot control... So I stay away from it and am 5 years clean&nbsp; ;D<br />On the forums I try my best to offer helpful advice to the younger generation and to newbies that will keep them safe and not get scammed.<br />I love to joke around with people and have fun!!<br />Peace, Light &amp; Love,<br />DjRob<br />

				Hello!&nbsp; I just stumbled on the site yesterday after learning that there was such a thing as the deep web.&nbsp; My favorite subject is myself.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; I&#039;m in my mid-20s and unattached.&nbsp; I am always looking for books on topics not exactly popular or known to the mainstream because I believe if an idea is generally believed or supported by the masses, or the government, or organized religion, there&#039;s something wrong with it.&nbsp; Anyway, while I was randomly clicking around to various videos on Youtube, I found a description of this site there, which is unfortunate in some ways because I already fear the consequences of overexposure, even though I just started visiting the site.&nbsp; I love it and would really like it if the fascist government of our beloved USA kept to its own affairs, but we all know the government of the USA does not usually concern itself with protecting liberty.&nbsp; <br /><br />I usually sit in my office to keep up appearances that I am concerned with the progress of the project I&#039;m helping to manage.&nbsp; My favorite drug at the moment is Adderall, especially when I have a book I really want to knock out in a day.&nbsp; I have no boss but I don&#039;t want to rub that in too many faces, so being interested in everything and studying all the time for the last two years while I held down this job not only has helped to pass the time but also has really given me a leg up on the rest of the world so if I ever decide to go to medical school rather than flee the USA, I will have the advantage of having read just about all the great books of Western Civilization.&nbsp; Nothing beats Adderall for motivation!

I love that it, and the BTC market, is largely controlled by the people. SR and the SR forums are FREEDOM. And that is beautiful!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I like uppers and MDMA.. :-*. and I love not having to deal with &quot;real life&quot; shady dealers. :) I wish I could love psychedelics but my brain will not allow me to relax enough to enjoy them.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Cheers! :) And welcome, newbies! <br /><br />(Side note, if anyone has an extra BTC or .5BTC, I&#039;d really appreciate some help - having trouble w/ my BTC vendor company -some time of communication error within their server - and I really, really, need an order sent out today.

				Hi! I&#039;ve been on SR for a short while and have recently made my first purchases (heroin and lsd). I&#039;m primarily here for the lsd. I suffer from depression and anxiety and want to use the lsd for guided mental journeys with the goal of helping my mental health.<br /><br />My work is as a customer service agent for a well known and huge on line store (not Ebay). My favorite thing to happen was just the other day when a customer called in and I, as usual, asked for the email address on the account. He said, really fast, &quot;chrissy brown @____.&quot; I replied, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, would you spell that?&quot; He replied, very seriously, &quot;T-H-A-T.&quot; Hilarious!

				Hello, my name is sausage and mash, im a herb man, my favorite pastime is smoking hashish, reading and music, all at the same time if possible. I spend a lot of time with terminally ill people so i have a slightly slanted out look on life. This silk road thing has given me an opportunity to fulfill my mission of trying as many types as i can, im doing well so far. I also like to sample psychedelics but not to often as i don&#039;t get the time, im keen on shrooms and LSD&nbsp; (although iv not tried acid yet) but a wee bit wary of research chemicals at least until i have enough information to fully educate myself on the effects ect. <br />One of the best things iv found on here is the amount of information available, its a brilliant way of getting knowledge, the site has allowed me to make an informed choice about what i do and do not want to do, this is what i consider one of the most important things about drug use, no scare mongering just facts backed up with experience/evidence.<br />Thank you to all who run and contribute.<br />

				Greetings my SR friends,<br /><br />New to the site.&nbsp; I have heard about SR in passing a few times here and there but now I am a member.&nbsp; Certain resources are scarce in my area, hard to find, weak or crazy expensive.<br />I hope to build some good relationships with vendors and try out some new things.&nbsp; I love the concept of SR and believe it will one day be the last course of 100% internet freedom as governments and corporations attempt do dismantle the free lives of individuals for political and monetary gain. burn em all.<br /><br />on a side note I am a moderate coder by trade and a good friend to those who have me as one.<br /><br />Cheers!

				Hello everyone, I&#039;ve been lurking around the forums for a while, and I&#039;ve only just gotten around to registering. Primarily interested in edibles, psychedelics and Ivory&#039;s MDMA. I just placed my first orders last night, and can&#039;t wait to try them out&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />This place is a libertarian dream, I must admit. Really love the atmosphere of SR, and everyone is very helpful.<br /><br />Namaste, x

				Ello SR. I&#039;m Vyndrah.<br />After spending years in the US rave scene peddling various wares of the best quality possible, my sources have all but dried up or went dark. I currently only have access to DMT and of course methylone.<br />Methylone is becoming a plague in the rave scene in my area, with every kid and his mother selling it off as molly. The pressed pills are also completely untrustworthy and people are dying off of this crap.<br />My goal here on the SR is to bring quality and purity back to my local scene with the help of many of the amazing vendors here. I look forward to doing business with many of you, and I wish you all luck and safe trading.<br />Much PLUR,<br />-Vyndrah

				@ Marko1952:<br />If you go to https://mtgox.com you can see the current price of Bitcoins in various currencies, use the drop-down box in the top-right to choose your currency. At the time of writing, the price of a Bitcoin in Canadian Dollars is CA$13.24<br />It varies a lot though. I think it has increased by about 50% in the last month or so<br />Good luck.

				I have been a member for 1 year but have only lurked in the forums.&nbsp; I am a high experienced psychonaut.&nbsp; I have enjoyed the SR community and decided to share this:<br /><br />I am sacrificed again on the ancient alter of my dreams. Now and forever, the priest holds up my beating heart for all to see. And in this way I am freed, for what was hidden is now revealed. Blood red I cry out, and from the depths of me, the winged beast is released. That griffin of old. That terrible bird. That Grendel. Astaroth. Rising from the east, the place of the sun&#039;s fiery birth, he spreads gnarled wings that fan the wicked flames he chokes forth. His eyes pierce Heaven. His mighty roar shakes the very pillars of the earth. He is both Visigoth and Leviathan. His claws scrape the acrid air surrounding, and the mountains tremble in his presence. His stride is of a mile, as his journey he undertakes. Monstrous his temperament, for he means no good to those he would oppose. His dominance in the hoary realm underfoot assured, he takes to air, his environ to survey, his displeasure to assuage. And even the air, that second element, to him is prey as he possesses the sky. He seeks Zion. That first among places. That worthy goal. That dragon hive. In union there with the universal essence, shall he dwell. In fury he makes his way. Forces of nature sing to the negative. The repository vessel occupied unfit. Vengeance resounds as his head he does twirl into the astral. And to Hell’s gate he ventures. There, all manner of beast do him assail. And the cosmic sword he unsheathes. The heads of wretches roll on Hell’s floor, there to rot for an eternity staring into the empty darkness that is Hell’s light. And to flight again he resumes. His course set. As a storm rising, he cuts the willful air. Him, no gravity can avail. With stroke of wing bending the night, he navigates the black sheet, the empty loft. Stars for a guide, his strident move he makes. And in midair his journey delayed. A shadow ascending, spectre from the unknown, revealing woe to those perceiving, does he spy. A shapeless form of endless girth, a devouring maw. That perfect evil. Reaper. The challenge set. The gauntlet thrown. The tangle destined. His move he makes. With Heaven’s fire he does strike the immortal ghost, risen from a thousand graves, meaning ill. His armored tail he swings as Thor his mighty hammer would. Spectre and he, hurling, churning, whirling through time. A cosmic dance performed. Thunder rolling on the plain. Lightning striking to and fro. War waged. As titans do they struggle, one with the other. At length, the stars reveal the lost cause, the crushed, the vanquished spirit. And Astaroth summons forth the astral roar, and shakes the stars, and with utter strength the demon he does kill. Though wounded in the fray, the firebird rises. As the Phoenix is transformed out of the ashen pile, so too the winged warrior. Ascension thus granted, his path is clear and on it he goes. Seeking skyward, the tops of mountains are but a resting point. A respite on the eternal path. And on the highest peak, his path he plots with accurate decision. The making of stars his goal. He who would sac Heaven and swallow its yoke. The journey interrupted, resumed. And Heaven did cry out, for its fate was sealed. The starmaker on the horizon. Yet, delayed again. His ilk, in midair perceiving, his attention draws. Bright as the sun, the she bird. To her side he wings. And breathes the fire of her perfumed essence displayed. The bounty of life therein stored. The milk and honey. The hypnotic. And he dwells momentarily in that grace. With slanted eyes drinks in the pool that is she. The oasis. Adelinde. His black heart swells in the onslaught of all that she is. In her thrall he is captured. Her spell is cast. She, also not withstanding the beast of old, is likewise drawn. And gainst the starry night framed, in that instant, they are one. Priest and priestess entangled in the night sky. In the eternal now are they consecrated and with venomous injection the bond is set. The shared poison ingested. And eye within eye they roil through the nocturnal. Set against a pane of the everlasting universal lights that do them illuminate. And their throaty dragonsong, like the blowing of Joshua’s horn, that wall crumbling device, is heard. Their quest into the ether now twofold. For each seeks the universal essence divine and the divination of the triune with their mate. Together they will rip the seal on fate’s book and scratch as new the fiery symbols of their destined births. As stars and even galaxies do collide, so too their wills with the evanescence of life. Transformation complete, they glide onward. To Heaven’s porch they steer and there do perch. For all is theirs. The gates there emblazoned with the eye of God to them swing wide and into the sublime they tread. Discovery resounds of the light and source. Into the heart of Heaven’s bower do they spring. The hosts rejoicing, they hear in refrain. In disassemblege of all, they are caught up. Their migration into essence assured, toward the center of the light they move. In transubstantiation with the divine. Transmutation into light. Essence Illuminati.&nbsp; 8)<br />

				Just read as much as you can about the basics such as, bitcoin (ways to attain it), PGP, and the way things work. Then research the vendors of whatever substance you want to buy to make sure you are using a vendor that best suits your needs. Use the search function before posting a thread asking a question.<br /><br />That is about it. Use common sense and think things through before doing them then you should be fine. A lot of new users don&#039;t do this and pay for it.

The order is also assigned a &quot;finalize&quot; date - 17 days into the future.<br /><br />The way things should work (and almost always do work) is that the seller ships the product, the buyer receives it - and then the buyer logs into SR and rates the transaction - the finalize. <br />It is at that moment that the funds from the order leave escrow and are accessible by the vendor. <br /><br />Unfortunately, a significant percentage of people never acknowledge receipt of their orders... Right now I have four orders in my queue that I shipped as long as two weeks ago representing close to ($) that will auto-finalize over the next day or so as the 17 days will be up. <br />So - technically - I&#039;ve had ($) in proceeds against inventory that I&#039;ve long since shipped sitting there, inaccessible for two weeks!<br /><br />Two or three weeks ago there was a single buyer who had three ($) orders totaling ($) waiting to be finalized. I needed to purchase new stock... That ($) would have come in handy. <br />Eventually he went in and &quot;finalized&quot; and I got the money.&quot;<br /><br />Hope that answers your question...<br />Some people choose to Finalize Early as a symbol of complete trust and respect to the vendor.<br /><br />-Dieseler<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey SR,<br />I&#039;m UnderBiggie and cannot be more hyped to have finally gotten around to getting on the website. I love the science behind and knowledge that can be obtained on prescriptions (as well as sometimes using) and I thought this would be the perfect place for all of those things. I&#039;m most interested in Xanax, Oxy&#039;s, Mescaline, Molly and other, general, high-strength pain killers. My only issue is obtaining biticoins. I for some reason haven&#039;t been able to transfer them to SR, or really get them at all for a decent price. I thought I might ask and introduce at the same time. Anyone have any tips/pointers on biticoins for a newcomer? <br /><br />Thanks ! <br />UB

				Hi everyone,<br />I joined the forums some time ago, and been lurking ever since, reading up on security, privacy, etc, basically trying to figure out how to keep myself safe, in case i chose to do something &quot;illegal&quot;.<br /><br />So far, the wealth of information&nbsp; available here is stunning to say the least.<br /><br />My Drugs of choice are LSD(favourite), Weed, and MDMA.<br /><br />Where i am located, the weed is dirt cheap ( about 5 - 6 $ per ounce ), but the quality is probably shit compared to what is available here.<br /><br />I like the idea of getting your drugs from a dealer u never have to meet, see, and know the name of. on the street, its&nbsp; very risky, and i shit bricks every single time i score, even though i&#039;ve been a user for over 8 years. I had a couple of close calls with the harder sutff, and got busted a couple of times with weed. Luckily the cops here can be bribed, so no record on me. Haha!<br /><br />One other reason why i like the forums and the silk road is because it is a big &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; to all the governments and all centralized forms of control!<br />I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I would like to eventually buy some LSD, cos its really expensive here, and it is also probably one of the safest things to ship internationally.<br /><br />Peace...<br />And please do drugs - they open up your mind to things....<br /><br />

				Hello everyone, I&#039;m pretty new to The Silk Road and I&#039;m still learning how things work here.<br />I&#039;ve got a lot to learn about encrypting messages and bitcoins before I even think of making a purchase, I&#039;ve got a few questions though that I hope some of you can answer.<br />When giving an address to receive a purchase, is encryption always necessary ? How can you be sure that there are no law enforcement agencies pretending to be sellers ?<br />Can the receiving address be a house, or would it be better to set up a P.O box ?&nbsp; <br />That&#039;s all for now, I&#039;ve got a lot of reading to do to work out how this place works..

				Good day<br />Just starting using site and find these forums very useful.&nbsp; Wish there were more posts on where to get more &quot;found&quot; items.&nbsp; Mostly name brand stuff.&nbsp; Anyway, I come to this site for personal use rather than selling purposes.&nbsp; I grow my own supplies and deal locally, but am always interested in checking out new products.&nbsp; I mostly scour the netherwebs for business ops, and other cool stuff.&nbsp; So when I come across useful info for the rest of ya I will post.&nbsp; Any knowledge of where to locate &quot;lost and found&quot; items is appreciated.&nbsp; Here&#039;s my free tip of the day for my new friends:&nbsp; FREE NETFLIX AND HULU!!<br /><br />*A (Activated) Prepaid Card or Gift Card with $0.00 Balance on it<br />*Internet<br />*Paypal<br />*Brain (Not Mandatory)Confused<br /><br />First you want to make a paypal account like a new one or you can use your own but make sure it has no cash on it then you want to get your pre-paid gift card or visa card with no money on it, after that just link the card with your paypal and then go make a free trial on netflix with that paypal with the card on it that has NO money, and it should connect you then after the trial is over it will not let you access your 8) netflix so just go back and make another with the same information it doesn&#039;t matter and if you check your paypal it should still be 0.00 if you had no money on it but you will still be getting free trials as much as you like ive been doing this for half a year so far.<br /><br />This method also works with Hulu, if you find more stuff it works with let me know on the reply peace :D

				About 48 hours ago I got an illicit thrill when I found something new. Not intending to stay long, I typed a throw-away phrase as a log-in that described how I felt at the time.<br /><br />Then I got a sense of nostalgia when I realized I was going to be browsing the internet just like 10+ years ago on dial-up in the middle of nowhere in a rainstorm, constantly cutting out, and pages failing to load for hours at a time.<br /><br />Then I got a little excited at the prospect of having access to stuff I&#039;d given up on having access to.<br /><br />Then I spend two days researching and realized that due to the draconian laws of the brainlessly conservative society I made the mistake of placing myself in, I couldn&#039;t get the stuff after all.<br /><br />But then I posted on these forums anyway.

				Hey- Ive been here a couple weeks now. Have yet to do any X-actions because Im somewhat confused and cautious of the whole $ into invisible currency thing. Ive been out of the circles for 10ish years now, but fuck around now n then cause I miss it sometimes. I grew up in one of the most infamous &quot;Speed Capitals&quot; and have experienced more to do with that drug than I can begin to tell. <br />&nbsp;I like supporting this site ,and others, that truly embrace freedom. I despise the Drug policies of the USA, the farce of the war on drugs, and want to see those rights altered from us returned. Hope this site continues long after I write this.<br /><br />I also like answering whatever questions I can to the less experienced users of speed- or anyone looking for answers on the subject, because most of what you&#039;ll hear from the traditional sources is bullshit and hype. Meth is alot of fun at times as long as you dont allow it to get the best of you ,or compromise your values.And unlike other substances , you can just sleep through your detox!

				Hello, my name is Scipio. I came to this website motivated heavily by curiosity, after hearing about on 4chan. I didn&#039;t plan on buying anything illegal here, but just to lurk and learn.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now, I&#039;m here to learn about computer security and drugs even though I myself am not a user. I am still trying to figure out PGP, BiTCoins, and Claws Mail.<br /><br />&nbsp;From what I learn, I&#039;ll try to return the favor by sharing my knowledge.<br /><br />Good fortune and good safety to all of you.

				H-e-l-l-o.......to forum strangers &amp; those I&#039;ve already &quot;met&quot; through SR as a seller (about a month now) or &quot;met&quot; under my buyer acct&nbsp; (I guess since no one would have a clue who I am as a buyer, they just don&#039;t realize we&#039;ve met but I still say hello and thanks for great buying experience!).<br /><br />I&#039;ve actually posted on the forum about a week ago &amp; cracked a joke that apparently I shouldn&#039;t have as a new poster...something about some us blowing a pharmacist for a 2mg Klonopin, uh, maybe I said that? I was only jk as I don&#039;t use benzos...just thought it was a way to break the ice here. The mod that day didn&#039;t agree with me and it was deleted before I could find a pharmacist&nbsp; :-[ Sorry Mod. I have a distorted sense of humor, some might say. I say they&#039;re liars but... ;)<br /><br />Anyway, just selling a bit of hydrocone &amp; Suboxone. And so far, everyone has been great. So much better than I&#039;d expected so I decided to say &quot;hello&quot; because you guys and gals are alright!!<br /><br />Have a great evening!<br />OperationPsyops<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hey everyone. I&#039;m new to the entire Tor Network. I just recently stumbled across it and have been blown away by it. It is fascinating. I&#039;ve spent many hours searching around, which is how I found this place. Which is equally amazing.<br /><br />I&#039;ve yet to navigate throughout the forums to learn more, but that&#039;ll be my next step. Look forward to sharing and learning with you guys and gals. <br /><br />A little about me, as my name shows I&#039;m a flow artist. I love spinning fire of many kinds. I thoroughly enjoy music festival, concerts, and the alike. Just graduated college and enjoying life. I enjoy studying and researching and reading just about everything, which this site and tor has and will help open me up to. Peace and Thanks.<br /><br /><br />Until.

				Hi all! Found out about this Silk Road malarky purely by accident while reading an entirely different news story online, and after a good month of reading all about it, have decided to give it a bash! As well as the obvious benefits of Silk Road, it was the concept that grabbed my attention. The ability to make my own decisions with very few of the real life troubles or consequences. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m currently an , ahem, mature student of IT Security and Forensics with a side of coding so hopefully I&#039;ll be able to help around the place in time. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So, nice to meet y&#039;all! ::)

				I am Henry.<br /><br />I am interested in learning more about cryptography, being part of the revolution of the monetary system, buying drugs for cheaper than they are available in my locale so I can earn a buck reselling them on the street, acquiring bitcoins and hopefully trading them pofitably, and being a member of this amazing community. I have been silently observing the forums for a few weeks now and decided I should make an account.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased anything through SR, and I so far have only about .004 bitcoins (and precisely 22 cents USD) to my name (this being the primary reason I have yet to purchase through SR). Luckily I found about ten hours work at $12/hr for tomorrow, so I should have some startup-money shortly.<br /><br />I am just now trying to figure out how PGP encryption works (seems fairly simple and I will be posting my public key to the appropriate thread shortly for a test-run).<br /><br />Thank you all for existing. It seems to me that this is the front-lines of the greatest battle mankind has ever fought, and if we win, we will be winning true freedom, as the forefathers of this country hoped their constitution would provide for us.

I love to write code and am very into technology and everything that goes with it, so I don&#039;t forsee having any problems finding my way around. It&#039;s good to be here with you all. I&#039;m also a cannabis grower, cannabis is my drug of choice, however I&#039;m open to dabbling in psychadelics, so I look forward to experiencing my first LSD trip in the near future.

				Hey guys, I&#039;m gaw910. I just found out about SR from a friend a few days ago, and have been eagerly browsing. I have yet to make my first purchase, because I am still working on figuring out PGP. (I&#039;m running Ubuntu 12.04, if anyone has experience using PGP with my OS, help would be greatly appreciated). My favorite drug is cannabis, but as I already have a reliable source for that IRL, I&#039;m planning on using SR to find LSD and MDMA, and possibly DMT as well. I&#039;m a college student in the USA, studying Mechanical Engineering, and I&#039;m excited to be here!

				I&#039;m not really new, I&#039;ve been on SR about a year and lurking around these forums for about the same. I&#039;ve been busy working up a rep on SR as a reputable seller and thought it was time I dropped by and said hi :)<br /><br />What&#039;s there to say about me? I&#039;m a nice guy to my customers, and will go above and beyond to resolve any issues. I&#039;m a bit OCD with my process and if it&#039;s not perfect I have trouble sleeping. Perhaps it&#039;s my need for validation and approval from strangers, who knows. It&#039;s been working out for my customers though :) <br /><br />When I&#039;m not dealing with customers, I&#039;m quite different. I can be a cunt who loves a good debate. I have a tendency to be combative, though it&#039;s usually only with stupid people. I find it hard to let go of an argument when the other person isn&#039;t employing logic. I enjoy reading about anarcho-capitalism. A favourite youtuber is http://www.youtube.com/user/stefbot/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0 though I don&#039;t always agreed with everything he says, I love the thoughts and debates he sparks. <br /><br />I&#039;m reading Krishnamurti&#039;s &quot;Freedom from the known&quot; at the moment. <br /><br />I&#039;m listening to the track &quot;Snow And Lights&quot; by Explosions In The Sky and it&#039;s providing quite a interesting backdrop to my ramblings at the moment. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on the road for a year and a few days now - looking forward to what the next year brings.

				Guess I&#039;ve be mooching around for about two months now - came across SR having read about it on a paper someone sent me from the ArXiv, so must have the least exciting introduction ever. Having arrived tho, mind is properly blown.<br /><br />Buying goods IRL has become a real drag, so while the prices here tend to be a bit higher, the convenience factor is beautiful and from what I&#039;ve seen so far, choice and quality rocks.

				hey SR!<br /><br />my boyfriend stumbled across an article about this magical place and we&#039;ve been lurking around for the last almost past 24 hours straight. we are in total awe and are excited to make our first purchase next week after payday. <br /><br />i must say that i&#039;m quite excited and also am loving that people are using SR on a social basis and not just for buying/selling. i always enjoy a place where i&#039;m not shunned for asking questions/ speaking freely about drugs/interactions/experiences/etc...<br /><br />i&#039;m definitely looking forward to taking in all of SR... and also enjoying some mind altering substances without the aggravation and creepies of the streets :)

				Hola,<br /><br />Being a bit of a geek I&#039;ve been a long term follower of bitcoins and was aware of silkroad from early on although I thought of it as either a scam site or ploy by a government agency.<br />Over time my views shifted a bit to the point I was shure it wasn&#039;t a conspirecy and my temptation to try more exotic drugs lead me to sign up.<br />My main interest will be in psychedelics (procuring DMT was the reason I signed up) but will by no means be excusive to the subset.<br />My initial orders have all been successful and incredibly impressive both on a quality and service basis.<br />I will try and be part of the community and try to post trip reports where I feel appropriate .<br /><br />See you around.

				Hi everyone,<br /><br />Stumbled across SR this Friday and am now just waiting for some BT. Looking forward to buying some MDMA and maybe pills from UK vendors. An eBay/Amazon style system where you can read reviews of dealers and pay using escrow seems too good to be true! I love the site&#039;s combination of being set up in such a geeky way, but for such an illicit purpose...

				Hello everyone, I thought I would introduce myself as well. I am a new vendor on SR and I am a vendor for RBG Pharmaceuticals. I currently carry all types of Androgenic Anabolic Steroids (AAS), and I will soon be carrying other types of prescription medications, ketamines, and hallucinogens. I am very knowledgeable on the subject of steroids if anyone has any questions and I would be happy to answer them. I have not been on SR for too long, but when I heard about it, I couldn&#039;t believe it and was pretty stoked to see that it really existed.

The feeling he described for his Mandy is exactly what i am looking for. I ordered before 6pm, so hopefully i will get it tomorrow to write up a review asap ;)<br /><br />I have spent a while browsing the community forums and it has taken until now to get involved. All i can say is this place represents everything society should&nbsp; strive to be. Open, honest and above all else safe. For so long i have had to risk buying drugs on the street where i would end up taking God knows what and half the time wouldn&#039;t even get high. Now, i can buy from reputable vendors, check out reviews and testimonials and get it delivered to my Door.<br /><br />Keep it up guys, much love to all the vendors here on the road.

				Hi everyone, call me Acid.<br /><br />Despite my username, weed is my drug of choice, and is all I have ordered of the road so far. I think I might become a vendor in the future, selling mostly weed, thc pills, hash and percocet. <br /><br />My 1st shrooms are on there way right now. Cant wait until they arrive. If I like them, I might buy them regularly. I love the road because where I live, its near impossible to get any drug besides weed, and even that is scarce. So thank you SR and all the vendors that are part of it. You guys rock!

				Hello to the Silk Road forums. <br /><br />I am named after my band, Penguins On Radioactive Nitrous, or P.O.R.N for short. I am fairly new to Silk Road, I heard whispers of such a site and then spent a long time researching about a very different and interesting side of the internet. My first purchase was Q Dance pills which blew my head off and I&#039;ve been enjoying the road ever since. <br /><br />Nowadays I have a very busy life with not much time for taking drugs however what really floats my boat, oddly, is collecting drugs. I have quite a variety and am always looking for new substances to add to my collection. I hope to one day make a Ecstasy collection case and fill it with all the various pills that come up for sale on the road. <br /><br />As for myself I enjoy many things, I enjoy posting on forums, going to gigs and festivals, building boats, learning about search engine optimization and most of all I love laying in fields and checking out the fantastically magical clouds up above.<br /><br />Happy Wednesday to you all,<br /><br />Penguins On Radioactive Nitrous.

I like to play guitar (very badly) and write/draw in my time off.<br />I want to use drugs not only because of the spiritual/personal possibilities, but also from the enjoyment that the use of drugs may incur in my personality. My local drug market is very shady, and hasn&#039;t got much options (just bad weed or bad coke really), so I decided to raid the internet for solutions. I&#039;m still confused about all this bitcoin stuff, but I learn easily.<br /><br />Regards.

I educated myself in such a way that I can&#039;t really listen to people and I don&#039;t really enjoy being around people because I see how stupid they are. I am a popular guy and I always was I shagged quite a few girls but I can&#039;t cope with feelings so falling in love seems impossible.<br /><br />I keep myself busy busy trying to find answers to rhetorical questions. I often find myself staring at the mirror and asking what the fuck I am and what is my actual purpose on this planet. <br /><br />I believe in aliens and god but not the mainstream god/gods, lets just say I created my own god. Probably my brain made me believe it to overcome the fear of death.<br /><br />English is not my first language,<br /><br />This is the only place where I feel happy, home, free and surrounded by smart people even tho I know I&#039;m not right and there are plenty fucktards all over the place.<br /><br />People that I like: Charles Darwin, Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Socrates, Martin Luther King, optimuscrime, DPR, Jimi Hendrix ,Bob Mareley, Albert Hofmann and the list would go forever.<br /><br />

				Old buyer come back! To those who remember Tony76, I got took for 10 grams of coke. Others got it worse!!! I also got bad stats after a vendor claimed two mail outs&nbsp; in the UK to Ireland had gone missing. It was expensive and my refund was so bad I knew vendors would not sell. So after that I felt pissed off at SR but did buy lots of great things here so am back as a newbie and will have to FE again.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I will NEVER buy ten grams of coke again!<br /><br />I am here to buy some cannabis oil as I cook a lot. I only see three traders but its India and Canada and no UK and never any Irish vendors.<br /><br />I am English and moved years ago so can get mail sent to the UK also if this helps traders.<br /><br />I would say Ireland is low risk when its just a gram of oil!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So helllo to some I recognise from the &#039;old days&#039; when bitcoins were one pound and the coke here was amazing shit. Tony76 sold some great coke but he did scam me and hope SR understrand why I left!<br /><br />Also the bad stats, I was scammed also. No way does oil get stopped twide. Plus it was N Ireland they got posted to which is the same as UK to UK.<br /><br />My problem now is I spent hundreds of bitcoins here but now its 0% and I need to spend 100 coins before I do not have to FE. All I need is a trusted trader. I don&#039;t need anything tomorrow and want to buy some good cannabis oil for Christmas. I can sign for delivery and agree to tracking and will pay for that as well.<br /><br />Please don&#039;t scam me is all i ask.<br /><br />

				Hey, I&#039;m fairly new to SR... I guess I&#039;ve been buying there for a couple of months now. I&#039;ve been lurking on the forums lately and figured I should finally register. My DOC is heroin, which is pretty much impossible to score in my neck of the woods. So long live the Road, and thanks to all the vendors who&#039;ve helped this junkie out.

I caught the virus before it could do any real damage.&nbsp; My passwords are on an infected hard-drive so its going to be maybe a week before I can get back on to SR and get my passwords off that computer.

				Hi, my name is Terrible Person and I&#039;m an addict...Just kidding. I&#039;m here to help, find help and buy drugs. I like LSD (SR has some seriously outrageous acid prices, that shit should really be taken under control, I know it a sophisticated process to manufacture it but GOD DAMN) DMT, the NBOme series, the 2C family, shrooms and weed. I don&#039;t support Amphetamines or Opiates and honestly I don&#039;t think anyone should be allowed to sell them here. But this is a free market for just about everything so have at it.

				Hello people.<br /><br />This is my first post, appropriately(or ironically), an introduction of myself. My name is upast7am, and I like to smoke meth, draw, listen to music, collect movies and look at freight trains. Some other activities/interests I currently enjoy consists of driving really fast in German cars, super gluing things that should not be super glued, writing on things that should not be wrote on, and tentacle erotica. I also love a good slam of some nice Persian dope or no.4 H once in awhile, or even better, a fat foil of fentanyl...Blast off! Unfortunately, I cannot do either of the two anymore, because apparently, too much of a good thing is a bad thing. But the absence of opiates in my life lead to a dope sick scramble to REALLY find SR, not just sit around quietly taking about it with my roommate between nods. <br /><br />Other than that, I like Dmt &amp; illegal economics.<br /><br />I really cant believe this shits real. Its fucking awesome.<br />&nbsp;8)

			<dd class="postbody">
				LiNuXtoker here to say hello to everyone. Also I must say thanks to whoever runs this excellent service.<br /><br />My story is that my wife was diagnosed with MS several years back. Until then, we had last used as teenagers when we met. We stopped smoking when the first child was born. We did use at parties when other shared but buying was difficult as we live in a small village and still seem as the new folk 20 years later!<br /><br />So, I was lucky to meet up with an old friend who was growing. That actual weed was sold here! At first, I could not even use Tor but was given a USB stick which just works! I am clueless about computers, and now I know that you press F12 (or another number on some compuers) then you choose to start from the choices of DVD drive, floppy drive (?) the hard drive which has window plus the USB stick. So I pick the usb and everything just works!!!<br /><br />Well, the grower sells to some other guy who sells here. I usually buy one ounce at a time, trhis lasts for maybe 3 weeks or longer depending on how bad the MS gets. For years we have been dealing with post delivery and using the clear_net (the ordinary internet and not this Tor) the difference here is that you use the bitcoins which I will confess I don&#039;t understand yet. I have a wallet with 25 bitcoins but don&#039;t want to mess this up so will read more about how to make these digitalised coins get to SR!!! simple I think but right now I am trying to upload the wallet here, but see nothing to do that. I know to read the WIKI, so after saying hello I will spend weeks understanding how this works.<br /><br />I work using computers but we have a tech dept and any problems, we go there.<br /><br />But I cannot ask them to upload my coins, if they don&#039;t smoke I don&#039;t know if they do. For years due to buying through the post it was easy to send money or buy whatever from Ebay or even Amazon! (people sell weed that way!) But buying off strangers is a worry. I have lurked in the forums and don&#039;t like to see people being taken for the scam! Robbing my wife of her medicine is fucking wrong. As for it being illegal, the village copper knows my wife uses cannabis and does not trouble us. So many people keep saying that cannabis is not a medical use but please, I can see my wife go from agony to watching TV and doing homework for some course she is on. <br /><br />The drugs from the doctor for the pain are opiates. These are FAR more addictive than the cannabis. After breaking a few bones, I was on diamorphine then prescribed codeine (which I still get) The wifes painkillers are now just thrown in a bag ready to be handed back to the shop. We still get the piankllers as my wifes sickness benefits (she worked all her life till the MS stopped it) will NOT be given unless she can prove she is in pain. We cannot say that she is using cannabis and our GP told us to say that. He knows, he does not mind but told us that she would be classed as a &#039;drug user&#039; and her benefits stopped. We bought our place when both working so lucky we have have that. The children have left but they all know their mother uses cannabis and do not have any issues. As children, we would not use, but perhaps it would have been easy to use the garden or just go for a walk.<br /><br />So, instead of buying in &#039;the real life&#039; I am now here because I can buy the exact same bud I was getting and I am assured it is &#039;Med Price&#039; which is what my guy has for a few customers with illness. It is based on income this price and a LOT lower than prices on the street or even off honest dealers who might do a med price. Few do this but maybe we are lucky and most other med users get no discount. In real life it is easy to see if anyone needs med weed. But here, I think people would abuse the system plus we have no way of proving. In real life, our guy does check prescriptions. Some medical conditions might be made worse by cannabis. We are friends so its not like a stranger demanding to see proof. <br /><br />My grower friend has not got a lot and most is sold at normal prices, Here we pay anything from 180 to 240 for an ounce. Hash is more expensive but we get some foreign imported Morocco and Indian Charas. The choice here is amazing, which is why our guy said to join and check out the amazing menu. Hash is important for my wife, as she tends to use a Sativa for daytime and for sleep some hash. She will use an opiate painkiller but has cut down so much we have boxes of those. We have thought about selling them here but we think opiates are just too addictive and we could not live with that. Shame really, we could buy a few ounce of hash! But, if you need opiates, see a doctor, not a dealer! We seen too many friends die of heroin over the years. Even in a small village heroin is a problem. <br /><br />Sorry for the lenghty intro but we use speech to text software and its very very very good as we can simply speak and it types out what we say. With MS, the ability to type even a few words is sometimes impossible. Cannabis eases the symptoms and helps sufferers to do things again. Making my wife a criminal is a disgrace and I will say to ANY policeman or women reading this that although we break laws, what would youy do if a loved one was in agony and could find relief in cannabis? You might say you woud take the legal drugs which means diamorphine, opiates and opioids. These drugs do not allow my wife to function and carry out simple tasks. She needs so much opiate that she is pretty much &#039;nodding out&#039; something she does not want and something she wants only when she wants to sleep.<br /><br />In the morning, my wife will smoke a joint around 7.00am. She never ate breakfast but now she will eat something! She will maybe smoke a joint around 10.00am. Around 1-2pm, another joint. Then she has a joint she smokes half of, then fisnishes off after dinner at 5.30pm or so. She watches soaps. Another joint. She then prefers hash if we have some. So my reason for being here is twofold. I can buy off my guy still - plus he admits to knowing some &#039;team&#039; which grows a shitload of varieties! The second and main reason is to get some hash here, but I am going to have to study a lot and will not make impulse buys.<br /><br />I know that &#039;vendors&#039; here cannot do med prices, but maybe some of you should. I can send you proof of medical needs and don&#039;t give a fuck about the law. Any judge would do what I am doing.<br /><br />So, I&#039;m new here, a bit confused by how it even works but have been told &#039;its easy&#039;. <br /><br />One thing I hav worked out is to link to listings of hash. Do vendors see this? If they do I am just linking to you because I need to seriously compare prices and make sure I am buying genuine hash. I trust my guys hash 100% but here, I see some selling &#039;soap bar&#039; which is a health hazard. I knw how easy it is to make Indian Charas &#039;cut&#039;. The kids in India mix cow shit with Charas and sell to the tourists. In the UK most hash is disgusting and I would NEVER offer it to my wife and be calling back to anyone who tried to do that. Here, I cannot do this, there is no chance to ask for money back IF you get burnt.<br /><br />So I am looking for honest UK hash traders. I need pure hash. This is for medical reasons and I arely smoke it myself and prefer beer, ciggarettes and maybe cocaine a few times a year to just chill. I gave up my job to be a full time carer. If you are in the UK and sell hash then work out how much that is. And its a full time job on call 24/7.<br /><br />So that is myt reason for being here.<br /><br />Silk Road are my pharmacy. Without this, I would have my real life guy, but as he says, he could get busted and then I&#039;d need another connection so I will try to find vendors here who might do med.<br /><br />Thanks for listening to me.<br /><br />Dragon software I use - hook up a microphone and try it, you can roll a joint for your friend as you type on Silk Road.

I&#039;m not really one for small talk but here goes ...<br />Have been on the road for 2 weeks now and what a wonderful road to travel&nbsp; although it took a wee while at first to get head around PGP and bitcoins!! ... but all old hat now.<br />Fed up of Dr&#039;s who can do nothing for you or are very limited in what they can give, especially if it is not a physical problem - and let&#039;s face it some of the prescription drugs you get have more long term side effects and withdrawal than many of the products we travel the road for.<br />Have made a few purchases and very impressed!<br /><br />Happy travelling my fellow friends - hope you are enjoying the journey.&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><br />

				Hi SR! Just joined, and I&#039;m really excited about making my first purchase (once I get some bitcoins in my account!). I see it as a hassle to source some of this stuff locally, so I plan on doing a lot of research on the site to make sure I&#039;m as informed as possible before I dive in. But this site looks pretty amazing, so I&#039;m looking forward to starting the journey.

				Hey hey hey, Just found this paradise yesterday and i&#039;ve been absorbing all the info I can from different sites in onionland. Tryna get into the whole molly dealing niche since everything where I am is either non-existant or 90% cut. Still trying to figure out PGP but I made a tor mail account, instawallet, I have bitcoin-qt on my laptop and i signed up with vertix and verified myself to get my bitcoins deposited and what not. I&#039;m still learning but I&#039;ll definitely give some advice if I feel like I can offer any. Hope to chat with you guys around here soon :)

				Hello everyone. I recently joined the SR community.I am an old fart, been enjoying ethno-botany since the 60&#039;s. It is so sad that things like this would not be needed if we could just have our own way in our own gardens. But, it is a blessing never the less that this place exists. Remember the wild west days of the web when you could just about get whatever you wanted until about 5 years ago ?&nbsp; I would think it is probably safest to order things from inside ones own country. I know that one customs seizure letter to me was enough to cure me from ordering from overseas.Anyhow i am not very computer savy so i am still in the learning phase about bitcoins and the other politics about this site. I hope to be an asset not a liability

				Hello there SR, I&#039;m AddysfromScript. I&#039;m just a student with a few scripts I don&#039;t take and about $150 in my bank account. I think you know where this is going but I&#039;ll go ahead anyway. I would be able to offer 60, 20mg adderall IR as well as 30, 1mg clonazepam every month.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done hours of research in the forums as well as bought some products of my own. I have my packaging and policies all ready to go. I plan on selling for about half the going rate early on to establish myself as a vendor.<br /><br />Questions: Is there demand for these products? Anything I&#039;m forgetting?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Edit: My plans are to sell in bulk (30) to minimizes postage hassle. Do you guys think its a good idea to start off with 5 per order to boost my selling stats and gain some reputation?

				Hey!<br /><br />I think this community presents some good ideals I believe in (anonymity, freedom, and autonomy), so I&#039;ve decided to join it! I&#039;ll try to contribute with the knowledge I have, and not to say things I don&#039;t know or made up. Collaboration is the key to innovation, so I think I&#039;m in a pretty good place for that.

				Hi, my name is SandSnake. I wasn&#039;t like every other kid, you know, who dreams about being an astronaut, I was always more interested in what bark was made out of on a tree. Richard Gere&#039;s a real hero of mine. Sting. Sting would be another person who&#039;s a hero. The music he&#039;s created over the years, I don&#039;t really listen to it, but the fact that he&#039;s making it, I respect that. I care desperately about what I do. Do I know what product I&#039;m selling? No. Do I know what I&#039;m doing today? No. But I&#039;m here, and I&#039;m gonna give it my best shot.

Now it seems to me that this site is very very real! haha. but seriously, i&#039;ve been trying to get my feet wet and look for what seem to be reputable vendors, considering this is all new to me, i feel its good to be somewhat sceptical, and no FE ;) <br /><br />I&#039;m glad I found this site and will do my best to contribute in a most awesome way :D

				Hello,<br /><br />BadboyBtrain here.<br /><br />I enjoy opiates the most but I always love mixing and matching everything else once in awhile. I recently moved away from my local dealers so I had to find a new source. I heard runmors about this place and started doing research on it. I found it and love the idea and set up. I spend hours just looking at the inventory and others opinions on the forums.<br /><br />So that being said, are there any recommendations (sellers) for people with zero buys? I will eventually sample everything on the market.<br /><br />Thanks!

				My name is Detective Stevens, but yeah how sick is this aye I spent days workin&#039; out how to do all this shit like the bitcoins was the worst. <br />Your laughin&#039; mate if ya in the States they got heapsa vendors. I can only see ones who send overseas, but opiates are a tricky one. All vendors will make you FE to start but soon as ya can get onto Marijuanaismymuse the better,&nbsp; the mad ones go on hidden, that vendor is in canada and is pretty well the only meth vendor who&#039;s chill with escrow for overseas. Escrows the shit man if ya new dont get ripped off aye, I lost $600 my first week to a scammer, dont FE for any cunt aye. One I wanna try for pills is XTCexpress in germany, looks sick. But MIMM is my favourite vendor cause he got shard and pills, also Ket. All depends where ya from aye cause you&#039;ll get most shit domestic like scripts and bud and if your a yank, your laughin&#039; cause ya got the cheap shard and pretty well fuckin everythin else

				Dear SR,<br /><br />Firstly, I would like to say that the posts in this topic were mostly very fun to read. Even though SR contains (mainly?) contraband commerce it is a warming thought to consider the closeness and mutual good thoughts of each other in this community.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My &#039;name&#039; is EntityCreature and I am a new member I have just recently joined and I have made two orders so far (cannabis). I reside somewhere in Scandinavia but I have been in many different places in this world. I do enjoy mind altering drugs (LSD) for academic purposes as well as for physical (cannabis instead of alcohol) and psychological health. <br /><br />I do look very forward to knowing as many as I can in this community, both vendors and buyers. My recent and only two orders so far have been cannabis from both Revenantchild and Djabbar (carefully chosen vendors). Of course, I will post the appropriate review post in the appropriate thread as soon as any update on the orders occurs. What I particularly love about this site is that I can send loved ones some LSD wherever they are in this world, as an encouragement for them to expand their consciousness.

				What&#039;s up Fellow Silk Roaders?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I go by many names around my area, somewhere on the Gulf Coast. For all Silk Road purposes, you all can call me SP, short for State Palace Theater. For anyone not familiar with State Palace Theater, Google it. You can also read about the many raids, but I won&#039;t go into that here. For short, the govt fucked up a very good thing. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for my new life on the Silk Road...I see many new relationships to be made and plan on helping to make Earth a smaller place. SR is the future and we are a lucky few that have learned of this awesome place. I believe we should keep our mouths shut, because pride always comes before the fall...and there is no damn reason to boast about this site to anyone. I hate to be greedy, but I&#039;ve seen too many great things, (Raves, Pain Clinics, Synthetic Weed, RC&#039;s, Border Crossing, Narco Tourism, etc..), all go to shit, because they got so popular. All good things come to an end. I believe something else will take the place of SR, but let&#039;s do our best to not speak of this thing of ours!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do I plan to contribute? I have already made 5 purchases in the last month, since I learned of SR. This was more of a &quot;test the waters&quot; scenario. Every purchase has come in without a problem. I have not ordered outside the country yet, but will soon. I love using PGP and only have problems finding somewhere to send my mail. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will also be opening a sellers account soon. I do not want to give much information on my products, but will make a new forum post, with samples, when that time comes. I wish I could say more on my plans to open shop, but I have already said too much. I am an honest person and was never into drama. Jacking people is just not my M.O., or my friends, and it never will be. All I was born with, is my balls and my word. I also do not sell anything that is not good enough for me. I hate when motherfuckers keep the good shit for themselves and sell the shake. Let me get a cola bitch and you can keep the popcorn buds!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look forward to working with as many of you as possible,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SP from Gulf Coast&quot;<br /><br />Things I enjoy:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Mary Jane (KB and Synthetic)*mainly Sativa and CB with high affinity for CB1, Psychedelics, Nbome Series, MDMA, Weed/Hash, MXE, Ketamine, GHB, Benzo&#039;s, I also enjoy many RC that I have tried, but don&#039;t wish to name them all. I have yet to have a Phenethylamine that I didn&#039;t care for. <br /><br />Things I enjoy, but try and stay away from:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Opiates, Meth, Coke<br /><br />Cant stand:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Crack, LSD or Mushrooms with no Xanax, Piperazines.<br /><br />(I&#039;m sure I am forgetting a few of my favorite molecules.)<br /><br />P.S. I learned of SR on my own. No one introduced the site to me and I refuse to show anyone. I hope everyone else does their best to keep their mouth shut.

				Hey, I&#039;m AnonUser13. (wish I could change that name) Sorry I&#039;ve taken so long to introduce myself. I only found these forums on Sunday, and I&#039;m playing catch-up as fast as I can. There&#039;s a lot of information to digest here. :(<br />&nbsp;<br />I was born in the Netherlands and migrated with family to Australia in the 60&#039;s , and you have no idea how much THAT pisses me off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve fooled around with weed, speed, and psychedelics since the 70&#039;s. I&#039;ve tried a lot of other shit, but in the end, I love my sativa. Pretty soon people are going to be calling me &#039;senior citizen&#039;. These days I spend a lot of time wondering what the stuff in the nursing home is going to be like. I visit a relative in a home on a regular basis, and I always see a lot of people sitting and doing nothing but drooling, I&#039;m guessing things are gonna be really good!! Anyways, I&#039;m an ex-serviceman (navy), I have University I.T. qualifications and have been in business for myself a couple of times. Hopefully something I&#039;ve learned along the way will be of use here! <br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to getting to know you all better. SR is so blowing me away. Thank you, all of you, for making SR happen. Finally some like minded people!!! <br /><br />See you around SR and the posts!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Helloooo.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been lurking the forums and SR for months before finally getting some balls and actually buying something for a festival. I was sick of all the expensive shit floating around where I live. A friend of mine used to sell me at cost mandy from SR when I lived in england and it was always great stuff, so I&#039;m hoping for the same quality. Just got first purchase and waiting for this upcoming festival to try it!<br />I&#039;ve lived in several countries and done lots of drugs and enjoyed all of them I would say. I&#039;m kind of over mandy as I got really sick the last few times I used. Nausea to an extreme. I have a bad obsession with k even though I haven&#039;t done it since June. I think it may be more intense than the little coke problem I acquired when I was 16....<br /><br />I moved away from all of my friends who liked to get spaced out and party with over the summer so I&#039;m kind of stuck here for the next year or so. Glad to meet some like minded people!

I tried reading, but these are way over my head, I downloaded the bitcoin wallet. I&#039;m just scared my money will never transfer into bitcoins and then get onto the SR.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s me. have a good one!

				Hello fellow roaders!<br /><br />I used to think I would never ever do drugs. Since then I done: speed, cocaine, MDMA, mephedrone, weed and magic truffles (same as mushrooms, but then legal here in The Netherlands). LSD is still on my wishlist.<br /><br />I will review every purchase I do here on the road. I like to read reviews of others. It is quality that I like!

				Welcome welcome welcome&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Kids all think they will never do drugs, me thinks :p<br /><br />I prefer lsd over mushrooms.<br />Take your time to find quality, because sometimes things are pricy here while not being of good quality. For example: I once had a so called : &quot;old&quot; blotter tab of acid, which was medium strenght. Half of it was stronger than I ever had taken before. Stronger than 4-10 other kinds of tabs or even microdots.<br /><br />So do your research, try stuff out and happy sr&#039;ing :)

				Actually I would not buy lsd on SR. The prices are totally at least twice too much.<br />1 blotter tab should be strong and should be between 0.5 and 0.7 <br />Perhaps 1btc, but never more and then they&#039;d have to be ultra strong.<br /><br />I usually get them for free :)<br /><br />One I get a vendor account up and running, while looking for IRL dealers in the meantime, I will try to sell proper LSD with proper prices. And not some other random crap on the blotters.<br />LSD stands for love, smile and dance for me. And is the opposite of cocaine/heroine.<br />A few years back I could sell them for 2 euro&#039;s a hit :D<br /><br />I&#039;m out of cash, and will be for a while. Have some btc&#039;s stored to try things out on the net. But getting a vendor account is 13+ btcs and I really don&#039;t have that. And also I&#039;m asking questions here and there to see if and what products I could sell.<br />So any donations would be welcome (see signature txt for btc link).<br /><br />BTW: I have gone seen people go to shit with drugs as well. Mostly from stupid combinations, or stuff like cocaine/heroine/speed. Even benzo&#039;s (those are pretty addictive and withdrawal is intense).<br />The psychedelic psychonauts I know who trip occasionally actually gained mental health (not including the 3 of them who had schizophrenia triggered.. but they would have become schizo sooner or later anyway, so I don&#039;t blame the drugs).<br /><br />Makes me think. Maybe I should become a psychedelic vendor who only sells psychedelics (duh), and stuff to get rid of bad trips (like an antipsychotic/vitamine c, walking etc.).<br />Then again... I need money to survive in this shit world with the economic crisis.<br /><br />But I&#039;ll probably never actually get enough btc&#039;s to become a vendor so until then I&#039;ll just keep dreaming.<br /><br />ps: if you like mdma and mushrooms (and the combo), try 2cb sometime. I loved it.

				Hello to everybody in this shady corner of the Internet : ). And I mean this with no disrespect, quite the contrary. A few weeks ago, I had my first MDMA experience thanks to a friend who purchased it from here. <br /><br />So when I say &quot;shady corner of the Internet&quot;, I imagine a warm, dark place where some people sit together, in friendship. People who want to see their life through other facets of their brains, facets they never believed possible. Myself, I&#039;m firmly AGAINST drug abuse, but I am extremely PRO experimentation / experience. Abuse is one of the things which made some substances illegal, and it&#039;s a pity. It&#039;s a pity because intelligent people never have to resort to abuse. They enjoy the precious special moments offered by a stimulant, they learn from it.<br /><br />So I owe Silk Road one of the most illuminating experiences in my life. And now I&#039;m here not only because I&#039;d like to repeat that sometimes in the coming months, but also because I wish to introduce other people from my very close circle to it.<br /><br />These days, I plan to learn a bit more about working with Silk Road &amp; Bit Coins. I would appreciate some stuff to read if you got. I&#039;m especially to learn why you seem to be sharing some keys around here in the Security forum, why MtGox has an exchange rate of only 10 USD for a BitCoin but BuyBitCoint.com and egoldfish.eu have outrageous prices and so on :).<br /><br />Thank you &amp; hi there! : D.

				Hey there SR forum-ers (damn am I permanently socially awkward or what?!) Just wanted to say hi. I&#039;m very much a lover of mary-j [OG Kush anyone?] I want to say I fall under the anarchosyndicalist category with my ideas about the world. I too am very confused why so many hate recreational drugs and recreational drug users. I enjoy smoking good weed and I&#039;m looking forward to expanding into new realms like shrooms. I&#039;d be lying if I didn&#039;t admit to being fascinated to write this post, considering the similarities I see between the world today and say Orwell&#039;s 1984... Anyways, hope to talk to other forum-ers and enjoy walking the Silk Road with you.

				Hi all, found SR though a search engine and my curiosity brought to &quot;the road&quot;. I have some fairly serious health issues and am always looking for an escape from the pain. Still haven&#039;t decided if this site is where I want to be but ratings are the best out there and considering so many people have been scammed so often via online pharmacies and yet so few complaints here at SR I thought my best bet is to check it out.<br />

				Hey, I&#039;m CarnCarby, been lurking for a week or two and I just made my first order for some 25c and 25i yesterday. Which will be my first psychedelic experience apart from smoking weed. I&#039;ve been interested in psychedelics ever since stumbling upon Terence Mckenna when I was about 14 (I&#039;m 17 now and just finished school, for a hopefully not-too-incriminating point of reference). I also love web security and what-not, I love all that nerdy goodness that comes from programming, playing around with linux, inspecting the innards of websites and so-on, I also make electronic music and have been doing so for the last 5 or 6 years which I hopefully in the future to that into a career. As a big fan of science fiction books I absolutely adore this site, It seams like I&#039;m participating in something new and exiting, I imaging its how people felt when the first few websites were being made, or even before then with the dial-up message boards. Most definitely glad to be here :P<br /><br />Tl:dr ET has found home.

				Hey guys, introduced myself on here a while ago while I was still trying to figure things out, if you are new and confused about certain things please feel free to message me and I can help clarify your questions, I basically had to do my own research to teach myself pgp, how to get bitcoins, etc. It might save you some time if you message me cause it took me hours to figure it out on my own :)&nbsp; then again I can be kinda slow lol

				Hi! My name is Freedom Outlaw, and I&#039;m an alcoholic. <br /><br />Oh wait....wrong forum. <br /><br />I suppose the reason I came to Silk Road is because my street connection has become unreliable, and I don&#039;t have all of the connections that I used to have. I&#039;ve been around the block a few times, and I&#039;ve lived on both sides of the tracks. Getting too old for that shit, anyway. I just like to dabble every once in a while. <br /><br />I am also interested in the &quot;politics&quot; and economic implications of anonymous markets, in general. I like the idea revolution through counter-economics. Bitcoin, Tor and PGP encryption have provided, or are providing, a means to facilitate these markets in a much safer way than traditional black and grey markets. Over the next few months I plan on exploring the possibility of starting a service that might attract normally &quot;law-abiding citizens&quot; to the Hidden Services of Tor. Sort of&nbsp; like the episode of Seinfeld where Jerry buys an &quot;illegal&quot; shower head off of the street. The more restrictions and regulations the government places on the products that people want, the more people will seek alternative markets.

I hope that one day soon I will be able to be in a position to become a vender on SR and will try to be active on this forum hopefully positively adding to it when i can. oh and I picked my name because I had a Pink Floyd and a Jimi Hendrix poster on my wall. <br /><br />-Purplefloyd

				Hi, I&#039;m Mangazi, and I&#039;ve known about the Silk Road for over a year, but never actually known how to get to it ;). It was with help of a forum, and a little search, that I learnt how to use Tor and get on here, about two months ago or so. I&#039;ve since made two orders, the first one never came through, might have been lost, seized, or never sent because I had no history. I&#039;m currently waiting for my second order of one gram of MDMA. The reason I came to SR is not to buy small amounts though, I am starting small because I literally have no money, which is why I came to SR, to get that international connection. After I get my gram of MDMA I will immediately sell it and earn enough money to buy five grams (shits expensive over here). After the five grams, the plan is to buy ten grams more, along with 100g of hashish. After that, 100g of weed.<br /><br />I used to take drugs, but I rarely do nowadays. Drug abuse landed me into a lot of shit before, and I try to refrain from using because of that reason. I&#039;m in it for the $.<br /><br />Although I do have sufficient connects to get 100g of hash here, it&#039;s still going to cost me 2.5 times more than on the SR, and I won&#039;t be my own boss. So yes, in a sense, SR is going to move my game up a level or two.

				Hello people, <br /><br />Thought I would properly introduce this account since I just started posting without adequately introducing who&#039;s T5. <br /><br />Well first of all, T5 isn&#039;t a single person. This account will be used by both me and partner. We run T5 on the Silk Road and we are selling NBOMes. We&#039;ve been selling on SilkRoad for maybe 3 months now, and we&#039;ve been buying for a little bit more than a year.<br /><br />The downtime SR has experienced lately forced me to get on the forums since I still needed a SR fix ehe. I&#039;ve discovered this hidden service maybe a year or so ago, when the website was still pretty small. Ever since, I don&#039;t need no other lover! SilkRoad represents everything a free world would expect: anonymity, simple transactions and great community! <br /><br />Don&#039;t know what to say more, other than we hope we&#039;ll enjoy our time on the forums and on the market place :D <br /><br />Hmmm by the way it may sound confusing using both &quot;we&quot; and &quot;I&quot;. Let&#039;s say we&#039;ll use &quot;we&quot; when we&#039;ll be speaking of the business, and &quot;I&quot; when any of us make a personal post ;)

				Hi Silk Road, I&#039;m goodvibes and I&#039;m new and I&#039;ve been reading a lot while I wait for the site to come back up so I can see what I can actually get here. A friend of mine told me about it and I couldn&#039;t believe something like this existed but I&#039;m not complaining. Seems like a lot to learn though.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading about bitcoins and while I have a general understanding of them, I&#039;m not entirely sure how to go about getting them. Are there vendors here that will exchange them for USD through Western Union or something like that? I would like to get them with as little trouble and time as possible but without compromising security if that&#039;s possible. Thank you to anyone who&#039;s read this and even a bigger thank you to anyone who can help me out with getting bitcoins!&nbsp; 8)

				Hello. You can just call me Joe. Been creeping around the site for about a month now and I must say how impressed I am. Never imagined there could be anything like this online. Still a little too sketched out to order anything but I&#039;m sure I will soon. Most of the reviews and testimonies I&#039;ve read on the main site are positive and everything seems to run on the down low so long as you deal with the right vendors it seems. Anyway can&#039;t wait for the site to come back up so I can dive in feet first. <br />

				Hello there and good day/night to you all:<br />&nbsp;I live to get high. I used to be crazy about the stimulants but now&nbsp; I have a prescription from a kaiser permanente doctor for vicodin (1 30ct. bottle of 5/500 pills per month) and opiates are my lady.&nbsp; I&#039;m allowed to refill my script once per month, and that is NOT enough. After I finish a bottle the next 3-4 weeks waiting to refill it are down-right torturous.&nbsp; While searching for online pharmacies I found out about SR, and here I am. I&#039;ve held off ordering for over a month so I could&nbsp; research net security, btc and pgp but now I&#039;m ready to make my first purchase, probably some form of oxy, because I&#039;ve had a bottle percocet before when I had open heart surgery to get a mitral valve implant and fuckin loved that shit. And those were only 5mg oxy/325 mg apap. Of course now that I&#039;m ready to go SR is down. Story of my life. Thanks for reading. . <br />Peace,<br />JohnGaltson

				Hi guys, its geeza23<br />I got introduced to mdma by a friend a couple months back and as we all would know here it was one of the best experiences I&#039;ve ever had. Since then, I&#039;ve been spending as much time as I can researching everything there is to know about drugs and so on which led me here. I prefer researching as much as I can so I know what I&#039;m putting in my body and the consequences/ side effects and so on. Anyway, I&#039;ve been lurking and learning as much as I can for a while now but finally took the plunge to join and start posting. Personally I believe that SR going down is a bit of a blessing in disguise for me as it gives me a lot more time browsing the forum and learning everything there is to know about bitcoins, pgp, and how things work in general instead of me shopping for drugs. <br />I&#039;m feeling pretty confident about those matters now and when the road is back up I&#039;m definitely keen to get my hands on some shrooms and acid!

				Hi people,<br /><br />Hope you are well and not stressing too much over the downtime on the Road. My name is fullshilling and I have been a buyer on the Silk Road for about 6 months now, using a different username. I&#039;m mad into music and my taste is fairly varied, so would give almost anything a listen. My drugs of choice are MDMA, LSD and Coke. I dabble in other things from time to time, but they are my main ones, along with alcohol. I will be setting up a vendor account pretty soon (hence the new forum presence), assuming SR gets back up and running. I will be selling primarily MDMA, with the odd offering of LSD here and there. Hopefully I will be able to serve some of you when the time comes.<br /><br />For now, shake it easy and stay safe.

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />I&#039;m pretty new but I already fell in love with SR and the community! (even if thing&#039;s have been a bit out of order lately)<br />Anyways, I&#039;m kind of uncreative so I just picked the name of a song as my username. I really like Aphex Twin.<br />well..and that&#039;s basically all you need to know about me I guess.<br />Oh and English isn&#039;t my native language so please forgive my mistakes

				How&#039;s it going on the road. My name is Qxyzzy and I am fairly new here on the road. I&#039;m currently going to school for an engineering degree and am fairly young. Mary Jane will always be my sweetheart, but I also enjoy my Molly/MDMA, Shrooms, LSD, and X. I&#039;m lucky to have good self control/willpower to keep the line between recreational use and addiction at bay. I enjoy doing my research and love learning how different drugs interact with the body/mind.

				Hi everyone. Well firstly let me say how happy i am to have found this site. I just joined today, and seeing who i can make mt first purchase from..<br />I&#039;m basically looking for mdma, which i havent had in quite some time...and its always been my favourite. If i can find some for me and a few close friends, then it would be a great way to end the year..<br /><br />Thinking of buying from chemical brothers, those ferraris look amazing...<br />But have noticed a couple of local sellers also, so will see...today has been an exciting day. <br /><br />Hope your all well.&nbsp; ;)<br />

				So I just got done finally making an account with SR since the site has been down. I&#039;ve been spending this last week learning everything I could about the site from Tor, to BTC and how to get them, to GPG, and everything in between. SR is nothing less than 100x better then what I was expecting. I&#039;ve already found the product I want, and with ease, just waiting to transfer funds to order. Thanks DPR for your fast updates, and also to everyone else who has helped me with information about SR via reddit. You guys are a tight nit community and I&#039;m more than glad to become a part of it. 10/10, SR FTW,<br /><br />AyKay

I thought things here would be easier, namely some Meth, but its the opposite. I cant find anything...no pills, no coke and def NO METH<br /><br />can some one tell me how to get to the market page... I was so excited that I may have found an answer instead of thinking how to go back to Miami on a weekly basis...now I am just confused. Peace

				Hello everyone! <br /><br />After long deliberation, I have decided to join the Silk Road community selling my writing. <br /><br />Although I can write anything under the sun you may need, my primary focus is to write university level essays and research papers. I charge on a per-page basis with references included free of charge. If it&#039;s quality you need, look no further. I custom write your essay based on what directions you give me, so you won&#039;t have to worry about your professor recognizing a paper with your name on it. Additionally, I never reuse any writing, as that can seriously jeopardize your academic career. I have worked as an English teacher for a long time and I know what professors like to see.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my profile at: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/51b39bb99f<br /><br />I hope to work with you soon.

I was diagnosed with arthritis in April and am in pain most of the time and the doctors will not do a damn thing for me (not old enough, not young enough, I guess...) My questions are 1. I need a recommendation on how to get bitcoins. I have been to 2 sites for them and one closed and one is not working properly. 2. Reputable pain management specialists...I need one! I take opiates for my pain and, actually, have some Xanax and some other items that I could trade in lieu of bitcoins...just let me know! I hope you all have some advice for me (and yes, I have been reading the &quot;required&quot; reading...but, I&#039;m impatient)<br />Thanks, y&#039;all, in advance!!!<br /><br />GBC Gal :o

				Hello peoples!<br /><br />only found out about SR yesterday and am absolutely delighted something like this exists.<br /><br />Been reading non stop about bitcoins and various security measures, it&#039;s a steep learning curve and a lot to take in but I&#039;m holding back my urge to rush and start buying so I can fully understand how everything works. <br /><br />&nbsp;:D

				Hello new friends! My name is Shunyata and I can not believe this place actually exists! I always dreamed and believed that a place like this exists and even had dreams about it, so WOW! I am so thankful! I came here after I was branded by the medical system. I have a real painful condition and I am sick and tired of ruining my liver and other organs with tons of OTC drugs which do not even touch my pain. All I want is to be able to live my life, go to work, take care of loved ones and not be in constant dull pain while doing it. Needless to say I am here for the pain pills but also to find new friends and share some spiritual ideas and maybe even some science ideas. I must say, I thought it would be harder to find my way around here but I guess I am not as dumb as I my evil drs think! The fact that we don&#039;t have to make shady deals in the &quot;bad&quot; part of town to get some responsible fun or proper health management is amazing! I hope one day all of us can find true happiness!&nbsp; ;D Peace! I have many questions but I will start reading and searching...rather than asking here....

I play guitar and love music of all styles and genres, along with photography. I&#039;m here for pure MDMA/ecstasy pills since I&#039;m tired of bunk local stuff, and potentially acid in the future, although I have never tried it. I&#039;ve done a lot of reading on the forums before I placed my first order 10 days ago, I can&#039;t wait for it to arrive, it should come within the next week or so&nbsp; :) <br /><br />I love the community here so far, what a great place.

I&#039;ve never had the opportunity to explore the aspects of life where few dare to tread. I&#039;ve had a few experiences with various drugs beyond Marijuana and I&#039;d like to expand my horizon even more. The only thing I worry about when it comes to use is my lack of education. I always like to be in control. I&#039;ve read a few accounts on SR so far and I&#039;m amazed at how dedicated and honest people are here. I can&#039;t wait to share my own experiences.

				Hello,<br />Stated to apologize for my bad english because it s not my language. So i imtroduce myself with late and after little buyer experience (7 orders) . Quickly i had learned because of those 7 orders just 2 were with honests vendors. But it s the risks and i wont to spend my times to cry om the forum. Ideally i ll wish to contact anothers SR users of my country to stop used drugs alone and enjoy with anothers. But mot easy because there is no locations informations for safety and it s normal. So i wish a.long life for SR and good enjoy to all SR members.

I like edibles, GRADE A, kush, mainly strong sativa stuff, but I wudnt mind some indica or even just hybrid (mix) and i wanna try stuff like pineapple express and amazing potent stuff that gives a good high. I recently had an experience with salvia so all i want for christmas is weed with GOOD HIGHS. whooo.

Very happy (+ excited) to be part of this awesome collective, won&#039;t be ordering until probably the New Year as I want to fully read around/get clued up on SR workings before I do anything. (and get to grips with encryption!) Mainly here for good regular weed as I&#039;m tired of some inconsistent dealers, but could definitely be tempted by some MD and psychedelics once I&#039;ve got the jist of it..&nbsp; :P Intending to start here and stay here.. long live SR, thank you!&nbsp; <br />

				Hi to all on SR. <br /><br />I am an artist of fine art, street art and electronic music producer. I am a stimulant and MDMA lover. I had wanted to try MDMA for years but never came across any then around 6 years ago while on a stimulant hunt &quot;the guy&quot; said I don&#039;t have any stim but I have these pills. Tried one quite liked it then thought I better get some of that Trance music as that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard you listen to with this stuff, within a few weeks of listening and dropping my life had changed forever. I had experiences I never thought were possible, I felt emotions and pleasures like nothing I had ever experienced. My art changed in a wonderful direction and I started producing the music I love so very much. Rather than a bad thing in my life these chemicals have been nothing but good and mind expanding. And the most wonderful thing the person I share this life with has come along for the ride and fallen for the same chemicals and music as I. <br /><br />I became a member a few days ago, since then I have been having a bit of a look around, checking out what is what. I have not made any purchases as yet, I have seen many products I would like but are taking my time to make sure I get things right. <br /><br />I see nothing but positives with this great site, the people seem very nice and genuine and with luck now I will not have to run the gauntlet of dodgy dealers, rip offs, poor quality and constantly having to find the product in the first place. This is how society should be, I do not drink I do not smoke and to have fun or simply to alter my consciousness I have to be a criminal. So be it, I am who I am. Maybe society will catch up with us one day.<br /><br />Look forward to getting to grips with encryption and actually purchasing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Galtourpa

				Wow, information information information..<br />Hi, I&#039;m new to this but filling my brain as much as i can with all the great posts.<br />please forgive me if i post in the wrong parts every now and again, i am new :)<br />I&#039;m looking forward to making long term connections and friends. Still working on figuring out bitcoins and pgp along with the other stuff. Hopefully i can get a purchase or two under my belt within the week....cause I&#039;m dry hahahaha. I&#039;m a designer of apparel and accessories, and currently at a creative block, (creative blocks effect my pocket book though) and need to take the block and pain away. Well, that&#039;s it for now. Let me know if you need any snazzy clothing made or a hidden compartment or pocket (my top custom orders are for hidden pockets and compartments. I once even ventured into the custom car interior market and decked out an Escalade with hidden compartments on damn near anything with fabric in it.) <br />Mahalo

				I am a college student in the US, studying jazz. I came to SR mostly because I wanted to find acid. I&#039;m a big fan of any psychedelics, and a binge smoker (I smoke weed constantly for a week to a month and then abstain completely for about an equal amount of time). I really love the honesty of this place, since you have the internet at your fingertips and the ability to post anonymous reviews, it&#039;s easier not to get ripped off. I love the creativity that acid and weed give me when I&#039;m writing music. I had a pretty wide variety of experiences in my childhood, culminating in my being put into a residential treatment place (not for drugs), but I learned to get along with society with the help of the loving herb. I&#039;m a pretty well-put-together guy now, I always read a lot as a kid and my parents raised me well enough not to become a degenerate I guess. Well enough self-love for me.<br />BTW it&#039;s BrianWilson after the musician, my favorite musician and biggest influence.

				Greetings!<br /><br />I am a newcomer to this wondrous place. Truly non-coercive, mutually satisfying commerce thrives here. What should be shocking to outsiders is that the standard of honesty here is higher, in my opinion, than that of society in general. Amazing.<br /><br />I am here to buy some stuff. Happy to see other people walking the Silk Road.

I lurked around SR in a state of shock for 2days before i made my first 2 transactions. My drugs of choice: all things weed, coke, &amp; opiates.

				Hey there!<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a member of SR for a short time now so I thought I would come say hello and introduce myself.<br /><br />I work in industry, and I spend a lot of time online. I&#039;ve known and seen SR in action for about 6 months now, as friends of mine have been using the site. I finally took the plunge and started using SR myself with great expectations.<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned a lot in the last week through these forums and others outside of SR. TOR, PGP, BTC, all new and impressive to me atm, and I&#039;m looking forward to learning more and putting things to good use. <br /><br />Why did I come here? Well all good things can come to an end, and after 15+ years of personal use of recreational drugs, you would think I&#039;d have by now a stable and reliable connection for purchasing. Well I pretty much do, but you know, people don&#039;t do things forever and times change. SR&#039;s MO really suits me at the moment, it would probably suit me for the rest of my life. So Im here now, giving it a go, seeing all the cool and amazing things available to us. I would very much like to make friends here so that I can learn more from you guys, share experiences, and establish good reputation with vendors. If you would like to send me a message, even something random, I would love to hear from you.<br /><br />:)

				Hello, my name is Jaemiisseo. I got some echo about SR when I was watching a documentary about DMT&nbsp; ;D. As I&#039;ve used different psychedelic drugs (marijuana and mushrooms mainly), I was very interested about it cause&#039; people using DMT wrote something like &#039;Marijuana is nothing but DMT can connect you with the God&#039; messages. Well, I&#039;d like being connected with the God, so I started searching some info about DMT on my own. Have to say the substance is very, very interesting, especially if we realize it&#039;s contained in every single living creature and plant. So it&#039;s obviously no problem for experienced chemist to prepare it. Unfortunately for me, I&#039;m not very good at chemistry so I can&#039;t prepare the substance on my own. Luckily, there was a guy that knew about this website and gave me an advice, saying &#039;Google &#039;Silk Road&#039; and you&#039;ll find the answers on your questions&#039;. To be honest, I was quite confused about his answer cause&#039; I didn&#039;t know anything about SR and have never heard of it before. But I found it on wikipedia, so I&#039;m here. And that&#039;s the whole story about me. Someone well informed in the preparation of DMT could help me and give me some tip on how to prepare DMT/Ayahuasca the most effectively. I was searching for it but there&#039;s a lot of&nbsp; &#039;recipes&#039; and don&#039;t know which one should I choose.<br />But in order to introduce myself and not talking just about my DMT interest, I&#039;d tell you something more about me. I&#039;m a student of grammar school preparing for the university orientated on the Far East countries. I&#039;m literally obsessed with China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia etc. with the countries&#039; culture, people, stuff produced over there (especially in Korea and Japan) and languages. I&#039;d like to move house over there to Korea. My other hobbies are B-Boying, automotive racing, music...and many, many more&nbsp; ;D I&#039;m also very interest in politics, mainly cause&#039; of negative effects of socialism/collectivism on the society, that majority of people considers as good things somehow. It&#039;s very sad people think the government is good and free market is bad cause&#039; it harms them so much but their only reaction is &#039;WE NEED MORE OF THE SAME!&#039;. It will cost us a large dose of effort changing people&#039;s opinion about the free market and the role of state in their lifes. But one day, we will be free finally.<br />I hope there&#039;s a lot libertarians on the site! I would like to discuss the topic so feel free to message me :)

Purity of products, peer reviews, harm reduction forums and low hassle, off street dealings with decent people are the things I have enjoyed about being here.

Theres alot&nbsp; of people desperate to get there hands on old style poppers , and alot of websites selling rubbish quality stuff, theres definitely money to be made by someone depending where in the world you live (i think Canada America and Australia are some of the countrys where its legal to buy) and its not that hard to do either, as soon as word gets out were to go you will probably struggle to keep up with demand so someone try and see what happen

				Hi, I&#039;m &quot;Josephine Denegal&quot; and I used to be hooked on oxy&#039;s and valium--moved away to cut myself off and was able to just quit cold turkey. <br /><br />It has been so long now, and I find myself craving them--plus, I feel like I could handle myself and just be a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; and not get fully hooked again, so I searched online and found SR. <br /><br />Just made my first two purchases, and I&#039;m like a kid on Christmas Eve--CAN&#039;T WAIT to see the purchases approved and get some goodies in the mail ... hopefully I&#039;ll get them before New Year&#039;s Eve bash ... yippee to SR and all the great vendors and tech support people on here.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Jdenegal

				I&#039;m surprised by all the cannabis for sale ... but then again I live in Colorado. Doesn&#039;t make sense to go to the trouble to buy from SR when you can get whatever strand you like from your neighborhood mmj shop. But I imagine SR is great for those whom aren&#039;t so lucky as us Coloradans.

				Greetings to all, and happy to have found you. I’ve been selling small-time weed for a while but never fully satisfied with my sources of supply, which can be inconsistent with quality and availability. One day I was dry and my disappointed customer asked me if I knew what Tor browser was, and I said yes because I had been using it for certain kinds of Internet browsing to keep the government from spying on me. Then he asked me if I had ever heard of Silk Road, which I had not, but he suggested I check into it. So I did. And here I am.<br /><br />I’ve been browsing the SR site for a while, also reading heavily on the forum site, also reading heavily about PGP encryption and Bitcoin, trying to make sure I’ve got it right before making my first order. I’m no computer genius, but I’m good at following directions. This has, to say the very least, exciting possibilities. Thanks for being here, and looking forward to being a part of it. Happy New Year!<br />

Really low doses of weed seem to be fine or if I take it with a benzo it is really amazing).<br /><br />I don&#039;t listen to music.

				Hi,<br /><br />My name is Chuck, or Chuckforit, or C4 if you want it simple. <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s my drug-related curriculum-vitae:<br />I am an occasional cannabis-smoker (average 1 to 4 joints per week) with a 2 years experience.

I am not into trying harder drugs although I am kinda curious about them. I surf around Erowid sometimes (Which I highly recommend to any curious newbies like me). <br /><br />On a more personal info, here&#039;s what I&#039;ve decided to tell y&#039;all cranky folks ;)<br />I enjoy music. in any form. Listening, playing, seeing, tasting, touching, writing and even sub-psychologically feeling (When you are 3-4 hours past your buzz peek and you sleep while listening to music max volume and you wake up with the entire song in your head for a week after). <br />I am not gonna start a list of my preferred bands or artists because that is not the goal of this posts and it&#039;s boring. Although, if you are curious about my taste, you can always message me and discuss freely about it. <br />My political opinion isn&#039;t very profound or based on any theory, but can be resumed in lexically-simple phrase; &quot;Worldwide peace is much more than an utopia, it&#039;s a reset button for evolution of the universe&quot;. <br /><br />Well, that concludes my brief resume. <br /><br />Feel free to contact me.

				Hello, I am the bluemessenger. This is all quite amazing, I&#039;m looking forward to delving into all of the information soon.<br /><br />I saw that the armory closed before I ever knew that this site existed. That&#039;s too bad, I would have liked perusing through what was available there.<br /><br />Mostly looking to see what the future holds in acquiring MJ, LSD, X. I see there&#039;s an apparel category... Heck we&#039;ll see.<br /><br />Cheers!&nbsp; :D

				Hey I&#039;m SorryMario. Some of what I&#039;m about to say is false. Discriminate with care.<br /><br />I&#039;m a hairless albino Nigerian from Antarctica who like FPS videogames, crystal meth, WEED, strip clubs, tweaking with cryptography, and piloting my converted lawnmower and woodchipper through monasteries&nbsp; filled with transgender reptilian nuns while singing a falsetto version of Bathory&#039;s &quot;Blood Fire Death&quot; (oh I like black metal too). Sometimes when I stay awake for more than 24 hours I think my house is really an observation chamber in a secret underground base and that the keepers who watch me would kill me if they knew I suspected the truth - so nobody say nothing, kay?<br /><br />Sometimes I say strange things that make no sense, but these spells usually pass after a little while. If I ever do anything like that here, don&#039;t pay it no mind.

				Hey SR Forums, I&#039;m HashtonKusher, or any other abbreviation of it. Not new to the drug game, but definitely new to (and loving) the SR. I am going to school for Chemistry with some dabblings into Biochem; anything that involves chemistry just makes me happy :D my main introduction to chemistry was doing an a/b extraction of caffeine from coffee. Hooked thereafter!<br />I also enjoy mountain biking, and my girlfriend is trying to get me into rock climbing. Otherwise, drugs are a hobby of mine, specifically psychedelics and the opening of the mind. <br /><br />Anyways, just a short introduction from me, I&#039;m sure more things about me will come about in the future!

				Hello SR!<br /><br />I started this journey when The Shroomery taught me how to grow mushrooms under my bed in high school.&nbsp; Shortly after that I found the erowid link to canadarc (RIP I think?)<br /><br />10 years later I&#039;ve found and used lots of online drug sources,&nbsp; I was kind of out of the scene for a few years (mostly bc I was on suboxone 24/7), but as I get clean I get bored, so I stumbled across SR.<br /><br />This place/project is amazing.&nbsp; People can do a lot of bad things with drugs, but at the end of the day prohibition just doesn&#039;t work.&nbsp; At the end of the day if I (or anyone) wants to get high were going to do it.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather just use my credit card than drive into the ghetto though.<br /><br />I think if SR continues to gain popularity and isn&#039;t destroyed by opposing forces, it will eventually force our global society to start legalizing/decriminalizing recreational drugs.&nbsp; Even if SR itself doesn&#039;t make it, eventually the internet will bring about this change.&nbsp; Even if governments got super anal about shipping, an anonymous Craigslist type website would suffice.<br /><br />I&#039;m excited about the future (minus this opiate withdrawal thing, but I&#039;ll survive)<br /><br />Cobia

				Hello,&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I am GerOne, and I am a college student from Eastern Europe. I have been lurking the site for a while now, and a few months back had the courage to order something, everything went well. I have a history with substances, I have experience with Cannabis / MDMA / MDA&nbsp; / 4-MEC / Mephedrone / Methylone (bk-MDMA) / MDPV / Pentylone (bk-MDBP) / Pentadrone / Amphetamine (Speed) / Psylocibin / LSD / Synthetic Cannabinoids (JWH-xxx, AM-xxxx, STS-145, etc.) and a bunch of other RC-s. I believe psychedelic substances may help mankind in curing lots of mental and&nbsp; psychical illnesses, such as depression. I believe psychedelics are the future regarding communication (DMT anyone?&nbsp; :) ) and health care. It is time for humanity to come out from our cave and embrace the knowledge these substances can provide us.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Peace&nbsp; ;)

				Okay, so earlier on whilst hammerfied on bullit rye bourbon I accidentally posted this intro in some ridiculous fucking section I resurrected from 1400 years ago.&nbsp; My apologies...apparently bourbon makes reasonable forum searching impossible.&nbsp; In any case, here is my intro again (in the correct place this time...I hope....)<br /><br />Hey guys, my name is Eternal Sunshine Man.&nbsp; But you can call me &quot;Day man, fighter of the Night man, champion of the sun, Master of karate and friendship for everyone&quot; for short.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m a young IT professional with a good job, a beautiful girlfriend, a great family, and a fantastic life.&nbsp; I pay my bills, I pay my taxes, I have my own house, my own car, and a few animals I&#039;ve rescued.&nbsp; I work out 4-5x a week, I don&#039;t eat GMO food, I don&#039;t litter, and I support local business and fight global conglomerates, imperialism, corporatization, &amp; oppression (I&#039;m a avid progressive civil libertarian &amp; local activist). I don&#039;t cheat on my girlfriend (anymore), and I don&#039;t even fucking speed (honestly)... I also take real good care of my friends.&nbsp; And I work.....my..... mutha.....fuckin..... ASS OFF (like 12 hour days, its ridiculous)..................oh yeah, I also prefer heroin to scotch.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does that make me a bad person? (if you said yes, than fuck you.&nbsp; That was a rhetorical question dick).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m an opioid man...long time user...very experienced...and I hope to contribute to the opioid community, and really to any SR community for that matter, as much as I can. And though my love is opioids, I do have experience with everything under the sun.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure I can add to any discussion anywhere if only at the very least I offer some ridiculousness.&nbsp; And please, feel free to tell me to shut the fuck up anytime (like now for instance)...I&#039;m not shy, and I love some ball breaking.&nbsp; So if I start popping off on some stupid shit, tell me..Please! Don&#039;t ever hesitate to tell me if I&#039;m being a dumbass, or how you feel.&nbsp; I&#039;m a newb, and I&#039;m here to learn.&nbsp; So teach away!&nbsp; Thanks guys for listening, and I hope this intro is well received and that we all have a long and fruitful relationship in the SR community!<br /><br />PS. Is there a cream for left nut itchiness? Just left, the right one is fine.

				Hello all.<br /><br />My name is Homertortoise. I recently graduated from the newbie board... which is pretty bad ass!. I&#039;ve yet to make my first purchase on SR... but its only a matter of time before I do. I have to wait for certain personal circumstances to settle down before I can do so.<br /><br />That being said, I&#039;ve been on the boards for a while. I&#039;m excited to make my first purchase and I&#039;m excited to contribute more on the boards going forward.<br /><br />I&#039;ll basically only be focused on buying small personal amounts of bud and shrooms on occasion. Though I&#039;m somewhat interested in venturing out a bit further in the world of psychedelics.<br /><br />Any advice and of you can give for first time buyers (beyond the basic stuff) is greatly appreciated. I&#039;m especially interested in hearing some advice from those with steady careers and relationships that don&#039;t want to risk those.

				I am a musician and poet, living in a deep dark forest.&nbsp; My biggest experience with drugs is with mushrooms, Liberty Caps, who grow wild in copious amounts in my region.

				Hi SR,<br /><br />I&#039;m ByronLugosi (the forum name is a deliberate change, it&#039;s an injoke I regret now so please ignore it)<br />I&#039;m new to SR as a vendor though on a different (and obv unnamed account) I have bought for a while.<br /><br />I&#039;m mainly selling opiates because I have the good fortune to be able to get a lot of them where I am and would like<br />to pass that good fortune onto you guys.<br /><br />There is an ulterior motive. For about a year I was on roughly 100-200mg of Oxynorm a day, which was costly and<br />very difficult to stop. However, I did manage to stop but have continued to buy the script. To stop myself using again<br />I&#039;m selling it all and honestly, the fun of seeing that extra order and sealing the envelope and posting the goods is making<br />up for the lack of opiates. I still use the odd MST or Subbies just to keep the hardest WD away but in way less quantities.<br /><br />I have an exceptional tolerance to drugs, an overactive liver to be precise, which is a pain in the arse as I refuse to IV so when<br />I buy I buy in bulk. I also have a HUGE love affair with K, though since moving south everything has been relatively shit.<br />I swear people are cutting K with methox. If you are, BAD PERSON! lol.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m probably going to be an active member on the forums. I&#039;m a software engineer and spend a lot of time on my PC<br />so I have plenty of opportunities to come on.<br /><br />Look forward to getting to know some of you!<br /><br />All the best!<br /><br />Byron Lugosi<br /><br />p.s. I&#039;ve said before, if you can get my names relevance then I&#039;ll send you 4 free Morphine Sulphate 100mg tabs. PM me if you think you get it!

				Hi there, I&#039;m CannaKingUK but normally use the acronym CKUK when referring to myself. I&#039;m a UK based grower of quality cannabis, and have been for years. I&#039;ve had lots of experience with face-to-face transactions and most looking forward to becoming a SR only seller. I never deal in anything other than what I can produce myself. I&#039;m professional. I&#039;m a fair person. I grow organically. I&#039;m happy to share my growing knowledge with anyone who has a question.<br /><br />I&#039;m growing specifically for the UK SR market. Our country needs a quality vendor at reasonable prices, and I hand on heart believe that person is going to be me. I really hope to look back at this comment in a years time and think, &quot;you said you&#039;d do it and you did :D&quot;. I can sit hear and big myself up all day, but I won&#039;t waste anymore of your valuable time. <br /><br />All I can say is remember my name, I&#039;ll be one to watch :)<br /><br />CKUK

				Hello there all you beautiful party people!! Been meaning to post an intro here for a while now, just keep forgetting to do so.&nbsp; Anyhow, y&#039;all can call me SeeY&#039;allNextYear.&nbsp; Why you ask?&nbsp; Because I&#039;m not telling you real name.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Fans of earlier seasons of Family Guy will understand where I got the name from.&nbsp; Remember the greased up deaf guy?&nbsp; &quot;You can&#039;t catch me!!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;See y&#039;all next year!!&quot;<br /><br />I am still kind of a &quot;newb&quot; here on the SR I guess, but I am in no way new to the crypto-market communities.&nbsp; I was a vendor on another site for a couple of months and did very well until my hook got pinched.&nbsp; I decided to come on over to the road because it has gone through some really impressive growth spurts over the past year or so.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think this place has the potential to get big enough to be completely unstopable. There are so many people on here now it is crazy!!&nbsp; Of course, that can be a bad thing.&nbsp; But not if the majority of us keep our faith in each other as well as this market system.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the Road going anywhere for a while.&nbsp; But if it does, the blame can be placed on everyone of us.<br /><br />You&#039;ve gotta help out your neighbor before he&#039;ll help you of course!&nbsp; Keep each other&#039;s back and stay a team.&nbsp; The only enemies we have are the ones who aren&#039;t using SR.&nbsp; You can&#039;t call the scam artists on here enemies.&nbsp; Reason being, the only way they scam is by asking someone to FE.&nbsp; I truly believe FE should never be used.&nbsp; EVER!&nbsp; What are 90% of the problems people on this site have?&nbsp; Getting screwed because they FE.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just don&#039;t do it people...&nbsp; Not worth it.&nbsp; If everyone starts refusing to FE ever, there will be no point in anyone asking anyone to do so.&nbsp; <br /><br />There it is!!&nbsp; And here I am!!!&nbsp; <br /><br />So here I am!&nbsp; <br /><br />Golden Rules&nbsp; ~ Don&#039;t ask me my name, don&#039;t ask me to lie, don&#039;t ask me to cheat, don&#039;t ask me to steal.&nbsp; And for the love of Pete, don&#039;t ask me to FE!!!&nbsp; Cause it ain&#039;t happening!!&nbsp; <br />

				Hey Everyone. I&#039;m sure this will get lost in a sea of similar comments, but I&#039;ll do an introduction.<br /><br />My name&#039;s Panzerknacker. Which was a German character similar to the Nutcracker who ate tanks. I absolutely love bass music. As in low frequency, not the fish. But I&#039;m also an avid outdoorsman and long distance backpacker. I&#039;m a definite geek and drug &quot;connoisseur&quot; (I like to do a lot of research to gain an understanding of everything I take), but had only ever heard about the Silk Road, never bothering to check it out. Sat down one day and it turned out to be a lot easier than expected. Now that I&#039;ve made a few purchases... I&#039;m hooked. <br /><br />The beauty of this website, in my opinion, is to allow responsible people like myself to choose their own experiences based on actual data. Knowing exactly what you&#039;re getting, what dosage, what strength, etc. Being able to have a &quot;supply&quot; so you can decide what points in your life are worth experiencing from an altered state. I love that. Over the many years I&#039;ve been experimenting, one of the biggest disappointments is being a slave to your street dealer, in both price and supply. This site has changed all that! Now I am directly responsible for how much I spend, what I buy, and how much I personally have on hand. <br /><br />Anyway, preaching to the choir here. But I&#039;m excited. Did I mention I&#039;m a long distance backpacker? I have ALWAYS wanted to take a low dose LSD trip out in the deep backcountry, but my timing never worked out. Here&#039;s to this summer!
