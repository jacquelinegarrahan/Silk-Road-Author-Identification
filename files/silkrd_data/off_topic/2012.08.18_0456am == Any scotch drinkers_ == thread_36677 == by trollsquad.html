				Dalwhinnie is my go to, and if you are willing to drop a little coin the Glenlivet Archive tastes like liquid clouds.&nbsp; Nothing better than a smokey single malt with a nice cubano.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious how it would be to mix a little 2c-b into this combo.

				Try laphroaig 10 year. Really nice. All time favourite and relatively inexpensive.<br />Drink scotch on the rocks with a tiny bit of water. Jack and Jim gotta be with coke and ice.<br />

				Ah... I&#039;m going to live in this thread for a while.<br /><br />I&#039;m new to this realm but have found the taste buds want what the taste buds want. In other words, I&#039;ve had the privilege of sampling some of the more expensive options but for scotch, I land on Talisker 10yo. <br /><br />I just completed a run with bourbons with AE and Booker&#039;s at the top of my list but I find myself now leaning towards less expensive rye&#039;s as my taste matures. Straight or Manhattan with Luxardo Gourmet Maraschino Cherries - an absolute requirement.<br /><br />My overall favorite this summer is Tullamore Dew IW on the rocks. Finishes like sweet coconut.<br /><br />

				Just getting into Scotch, totally hated it all my life but now I&#039;m in my swingin 30s i think my taste buds are mature enough to start appreciating it :P<br />My dad loves the stuff and I&#039;ve been sampling some of his gear over the last few weeks, not familiar with any brands as yet but I think I&#039;ll be looking to buy some soon. All I know at this stage is cheap shit tastes nasty, perhaps this is why I&#039;ve not got into it sooner.

				I&#039;ll second the dalwhinnie, laphroaig is good and highland park or maybe ardbeg. you find the ones from peatier areas more smokey/smooth generally and the ones from granite areas a little more astringent.<br /><br />ome thing for sure, you shouldnt be using ice, maybe a drop of water though.<br /><br />if youre willing to open your mind a bit Japan has some excellent whisky, have a look at Yamazaki

				the reason for no ice is you shouldn&#039;t be chilling it, like a good brandy the warmth releases more taste via the smell. At a guess I&#039;m saying those of you suggesting ice in your scotch aren&#039;t actually from Scotland (and no I don&#039;t count your great great great grandfather being Scottish to mean you are).

				I prefer Macallan 18 year. If you&#039;re just getting into scotch, I&#039;d suggest getting several of the minnies, and doing a blind taste test with a friend. Get some in a range of prices... In doing so, it will eliminate the, &quot;this is expensive, so it tastes good&quot; bias. In between each tasting, eat some crackers or bread, and drink a few sips of water. If you just try one scotch after another, their flavors will start to blend together.

				I&#039;m definitely a Macallan fan. All the years for it are good. The 12 is a nice mellow yet sharp drink versatile for nightcaps and regular drinking. The 18 is something to be savored with a cigar in hand and a good environment. The 10 is a special case that has spicy tangs and is excellent as an after dinner drink.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard that the Japanese Yamazaki 12 yr is smooth and slightly sweet. I&#039;ve also sampled a bunch of other whiskey&#039;s that are all unique in their flavors and their smells. Chivas, Jack, Jim, and Johnny are OK but is better with coke unless you got 18yr+, then coke is a travesty.<br /><br />When entering the whiskey world, always go for single malt for the &#039;purer&#039; flavors. Never mix anything that is older than 12 years with anything other than ice. The ice will melt, therefore precluding water. Adding water with ice just wastes it if you drink it slow.<br /><br />If you are a fan of cigars, whiskey goes extremely well with a cigar. Get a $10 cigar and a nice glass of whiskey and you&#039;ll be set for 45 minutes of pure, relaxed enjoyment. That&#039;s what I did yesterday to cap off my 4 day party weekend.

				I slowly started drinking scotch and getting used to it. At first I started with scotch on the rocks with a splash of water and coke back. Then I went to just scotch on the rocks with less water. Then, scotch with just one/two ice cubes. Then finally just scotch with a sprinkling of water.<br /><br />I tried to man up (at first) by just having scotch by itself the 3rd time I had it... but I guess I was too girly at the time. Now, I love Macallan and have no problem drinking it :)<br /><br />

				Talsker is the king of Whiskey (It&#039;s a region in its own right) Not an ISLAY but an ISLAND - Very nice, the distilery is on the sea so you get a subtle taste of sea salt.... I also recomend getting a hold of &#039;Greens Ginger Wine&#039; A strong drink, but believe me the was to drink it.<br />In my collection, I&#039;ve a cheap bottle of Grants (Blend) a Chivas Regal 12yr (Blend) a Talisker 12yr (Island) and Dalwhinnie 15yr (highland)<br /><br />Have to agree with the above post a Macallan is a good whisky and will be joining the collection soon!
