				Well I suppose I should say this so that people get another point of reference for how dangerous these things are . last thing I remember my computer was trying to start up . I came to my room when I awoke twelve hours later and apparently my sr account was open and logged into as well as my facebook. I checked my email and I guess I didn&#039;t send a message to whatshertits which is wonderful given that I probably would have without a doubt fucked things up really badly. so yeah, just be careful folks. alchohol is dangerous.

				They reduced the amount of sugars in them here. They used to taste so good, but now I can barely take them.&nbsp; Although, yeah they are a pretty potent concoction still :)

				We don&#039;t have those in Canada, but when I was drinking I sometimes would get some vodka coolers that destroyed me and left me blackout drunk. Not a good feeling at all.

				They used to be &quot;Energy Drinks&quot; that contained alcohol. Basically, drinking a 12% 4 Loko or &quot;Joose(before 4 Loko)&quot; was like slamming 6+ redbulls, and drinking a bottle of wine, in one drink.<br /><br />Most people I knew would buy 2, and try to drink 2.&nbsp; &nbsp;That always blacked people out, and they&#039;d be SO fucking whack. Like, speaking absolute non-sense, being agressive, pissing themselves, shitting in imaginary toilets, etc.. <br /><br />
