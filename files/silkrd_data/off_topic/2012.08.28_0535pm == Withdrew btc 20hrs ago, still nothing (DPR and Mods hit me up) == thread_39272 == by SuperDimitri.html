				Withdrew a substantial amount of btc, as my vendor hasn&#039;t responded, and didn&#039;t want them in my sr wallet, and it&#039;s now been 20 hrs, and nothing. Yes, I sent to the correct address. I been doing this a while, kids. Funny thing is, in the withdrawal it doesn&#039;t show the address I sent it to, it&#039;s just blank. It&#039;s never taken more than 3 hrs, in or out. I am fucking worried that I just got hit hard by the disappearing coin trick. DPR, I would appreciate if you and your minions could sort this out rather quickly. In just over 8 months, I have never had a problem, until now. And it&#039;s got my nerves racked.&nbsp; :(

				When you do a withdrawal it is blank... this is so folks won&#039;t be able to tell where you sent your coins if your account gets compromised.<br />It only says something if you send coins directly to another account, or if you purchase something or receive coins.<br /><br />PM DPR on the main, enough people are complaining about this that it will be taken care of.

				Yes, I also sent word via the road, and finally got a reply. Short and somewhat unassuring, saying there is a withdrawal issue, and it&#039;s currently being worked on. But 28 hours without my coin is quite disheartening. Couple hundred bucks, not so sketchy, a few grand......not cool. Now I have to worry about flux, and my vendor not having items after my long wait. Plus, my vacation is coming up, and I was trying to stock up for it, as I don&#039;t have hookups out of state. It&#039;s just frustrating.

				Well, I haven&#039;t seen anyone else lighting up the boards about this issue. It&#039;s now been 50+ hours, and the small drop means even if I do get my coins, I have lost 120usd just waiting, when I should be having my order arrive tomorrow, instead, I am not able to do anything. <br />Support has only sent one message, only saying it&#039;s being worked on. No ETA. No nothing.<br />With my stats, and length of membership, I think DPR should loan me the 307btc, so I can make my orders. <br />The last time I remember this happening, it didn&#039;t happen to me, but I know they didn&#039;t &#039;fix&#039; the bug until coin crashed again, and everyone lost a ton of scrilla. <br />I just want my coins. What&#039;s the issue with the wallets on SR, they work everywhere else. <br />
