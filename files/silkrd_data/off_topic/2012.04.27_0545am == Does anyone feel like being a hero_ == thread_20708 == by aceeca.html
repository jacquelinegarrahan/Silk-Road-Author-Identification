				So, I know a lot of sellers post things like their emails and other ways to contact them just in case SR ever ends up being shut down. Due to recent fascist political endeavors, I thought it would be very cool if someone listed all the sellers that have different ways of contacting them, and what they sell. Yep.

Isn&#039;t crackable any time soon and there is no legal basis to make the people who run TOR to be compelled to give up the keys. I was a bit skeptical of this but I asked the guy who manages my phone encryption and he confirmed it. There isn&#039;t anything that can crack TOR at this time.

				You guys must have short memories if you don&#039;t remember what happened with OVDB. SR is a relatively centralized institution. You won&#039;t be so lazare faire if all the hidden services you currently use evaporate overnight. SR gets turned off for an hour, and this board gets flooded with panicking buyers every time. This is a global business not a cottage industry, you can&#039;t just pop out for a coffee break and a smoke, the service has to flow 24 hours a day, 365.25 days a year.<br /><br />Remember how it feels when the electricity goes in a black-out? All previous assumptions are rendered invalid. You have to visit a shop just to buy water because your pump doesn&#039;t work. And you feel stupid for not having candles or matches etc, until the lights come back on and you promptly forget the inconvenience. You didn&#039;t get smarter because the lights came on. You just got more confident.<br /><br />The point is that if there was a highly decentralized method of the entire network anonymously communicating with itself without using SR as a intermediary, then that would be a good thing. It gives flexibility, redundancy. It would make bouncing back from an attack instantaneous. Sure it&#039;d happen anyway, but why have a disruption in service?<br /><br />The key thing is to make it so that even if LE &#039;intercepted&#039; messages or was a member of that network, that it would be completely irrelevant.<br /><br />Making a list of clearweb contact details is stupid, yes. But the problem is real even if the solution purposed was crap. Why do you think Speak Easy is being built? <br /><br />Instead of pointing fingers, try to come up with some interim ideas to fix the problem. Something that isn&#039;t obviously dependent on a single set of DOSable servers somewhere.<br /><br />

Having just said that:<br /><br />-&gt; They don&#039;t depend on the DNS system, at least the regular one people use. Tor has it&#039;s own DNS system.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, even if everybody doesn&#039;t have web access because DNS lookup doesn&#039;t work, we&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />-&gt; The full name for them is: location hidden services. All traffic to/from service is encrypted since it flows over the Tor network.<br /><br />-&gt; Unlike a regular web server, we cannot obtain (without great difficulty) the ip address of the location hidden service. We obtain the .onion url to be sure, but it doesn&#039;t translate to an ip address and that is what makes shutting down a hidden service so difficult. Ask kmf for a more lucid technical explanation of why this works, but work it does. It probably works by public key cryptography of course, but the details escape me. <br /><br />As for your 2nd question, it depends on a whole bunch of stuff. If you took down SR, Tormail and the forums, then what would you do? I mean a typical takedown operation on the clearweb takes down hundreds or thousands of websites. And many of the contact details are completely fake anyway. That&#039;s why I&#039;m not happy with the &#039;Plan B&#039; you guys go going there. It&#039;s better than no plan at all, but it&#039;s not great.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20708.msg233313#msg233313">Quote from: vlad1m1r on May 10, 2012, 02:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I imagine if SR was taken down for any reason, a new site would be set up and the address for it would be posted across every major message board so that people could get back in touch - I also imagine the site&#039;s creators keep regular back ups in case this happens to restore people&#039;s account details - do we really need to do anything above and beyond this?
