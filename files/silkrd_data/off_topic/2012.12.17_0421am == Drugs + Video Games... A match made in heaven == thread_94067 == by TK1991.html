				I can&#039;t be the only person that sits around in their pajamas every sunday smoking pot and playing video games, the rest of the internet has surely done this from time to time.&nbsp; ;D<br />I personally mix different games/drugs that I think will compliment each other, sometimes the results are brilliant, other times I pick pieces of controller out of the shag in the morning.<br />I&#039;ll be putting up small reviews of games I have played and the complimentary substance I played them on, as well as which respective system the game is for. I hope you enjoy reading about it as I did playing it&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m planning on giving my personal reviews/opinions as well as hearing yours, I&#039;d be happy to hear any suggestions/reviews of games to play :)<br />

We have a few halo players here. coke and weed are the norm around here but playing grand theft auto on some good mush is a wicked summer favorite of ours.<br /><br />MM

				Not too big on COD, honestly I feel like Battlefield does a much better job of that genre and COD is generally populated by falsetto voiced prepubescent teens anyway...<br />Battlefield 3 on the other hand I can shoot a moving attack helicopter out of the sky with my tanks while my squad fire javelin missiles at enemy tanks and two f16s dog fight over head.<br /><br />Boss.<br /><br />I don&#039;t actually play much on xbox anymore, but a friend of mine brought over Halo4 (I put more hours into halo 3 then I care to admit) and it was a good time.

				I fully endorse the assertion made by this thread. Video games can go GREAT with drugs! ;D<br /><br />I made this recommendation in another thread, but my favorite match at the moment is Botanicula and a really strong sativa cannabis. Check out the 9:30 mark in this vid for an idea of why it makes such a great combo ;) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y58OYaX5TvY (but if you intend on playing sometime, don&#039;t spoil it for yourself by watching the whole thing, a lot of the game&#039;s charm comes from discovering it for yourself).<br /><br />Of course, if somebody thinks games = adrenaline rushes and nothing else, this chill little point and click adventure might appear boring. But it has beautiful and charming visuals, an eclectic and catchy sound track, engaging and pleasant puzzles...all in all it&#039;s a masterpiece by one of the great indie developers Amanita Design.

I feel compelled to turn people onto this game. There were so many times while I was playing it where I&#039;d get to a new screen, start interacting with elements to figure out what I was supposed to do, and all of a sudden the whole game world would start melding into various psychedelic imagery, and I&#039;d be like, &quot;WOW! I remember seeing something just like when I tripped on acid 10 years ago!&quot; My personal feeling about the game is that it was made to be a loving homage to acid-heads everywhere, but done in such a way that it will just seem weird, cute, and fun to the uninitiated. But the rest of us *know* what it&#039;s about. Also the fact that the studio is named after a psychedelic mushroom is a pretty good indicator.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />...ugh, can&#039;t believe it&#039;s so late. off to bed with myself. Just had to get that praise out of my system (I so rarely find myself wanting to be a fanboy about anything like this ;) )

				MXE is always nice for playing games. I also once played all the way through Capsized, an amazing little 2D platformer/shooter/exploration game on 9.6mg of 25i. That was the most fucked up night of my life.<br />I&#039;m currently playing Saints Row: The Third and Red Faction: Armageddon.<br /><br />We should make gameplay videos on various drugs ;D

				Me and few mates attempted to play Fifa 13 whilst coming up on MDMA just before a night out. At the time it felt amazing and was extremely funny, made the pitch look very vibrant but not one of us were able to score, things seem to slow down but speed up at the same time lol. I remember whenever the controller vibrated it felt so good in my hands.

				I&#039;m such a video game person that... well, to go into detail would venture close to identifying information.<br /><br />That said, I&#039;ve never tried pot anywhere but the streets of Amsterdam sadly, and the only other drug I&#039;ve been able to try is acid, and my first two times I figured I&#039;d come up playing games but they just really stressed me the fuck out and I ended up stopping them. I thought a game near and dear to me that I know inside and out (Super Mario Sunshine) would be cool the 2nd time but--it&#039;s hard to explain, but--it just really made me uncomfortable (as did the shaky camera in my favorite show, Trailer Park Boys).<br /><br />When I doubled my dose and had my first proper trip I decided to forget the games idea and just watched Fear and Loathing, and I found that the higher dose made the &quot;uncomfortable&quot; period of the come-up feel much shorter, so I&#039;m looking forward to trying games again next time.<br /><br />Beatles Rock Band is a fave of mine as is Ultimate Doom (showing my age, heh), and I might give the latter a try since I&#039;m currently doing a run-through (if the L gets here before I&#039;m finished that is).

Except heroin warm high when there&#039;ss cold outside or you&#039;re too cold to get out of bed shooting up is perfect then.

				I generally enjoy popping a few shrooms or preparing shroom tea and getting down on some games..... Personal favorites for shrooming are Borderlands 2(the cell shading is AMAZING on shrooms), COD:BO2(for the zombies only), The walking dead games(mostly story so you don&#039;t need great motor functions if your far gone), Torchlight2 (Best Diablo clone EVER), Scribblenauts WiiU Version (just try it..... honestly your imagination is amazing on this), ZombieU (play with a friend for asshole moments you will both laugh about for years). I am sure I am missing MANY games that I have tripped on with great results but honestly just get a good list of games you love and try some psychedelics out. IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!!

I recommend everyone to check out &quot;Ballistics&quot;. It&#039;s literally the fastest-paced game ever. There is no limit to velocity in this game. It&#039;s amazing on speed (the drug). Coincidence? ;D

Rep to you bro. I agree COD isn&#039;t for everyone but I LOVE zombie mode by myself. The rush of making it to 25+ is out of this world scary. Dude I want to read that trip report BAD. BTW if you get some extra coins check out my listings for CHEAP boomers and will be adding a great trip report thread to try and get the community into letting more newbies know what REALLY happens when you take mushrooms. I&#039;m getting sick and tired of people claiming to see god and shit off under an 1/8. I and others eat 1/4&#039;s from time to time and I&#039;ve never broken through like that.
