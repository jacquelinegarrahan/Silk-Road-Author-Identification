				Not sure how this SR forum works precisely, but how did you get 5 bars of rep (the yellow boxes in user-bar) with only 45 post count? And why your profile only shows 6 actual posts, but the post count is 45?<br /><br />Since you&#039;re member from July I assume maybe the rep is based on the date.. and all your old posts are too old for the history to show.. but that&#039;s an unusual design for a forum software, so maybe not the correct answer.

I said nothing about it other than &quot;here you go&quot; and he more or less just said &quot;wow that was fast&quot;<br /><br />was i dishonest for not volunteering to him this information and all of the bonus and/or the opportunity to clear 150 BTC at that price? what he may never know may never hurt him. :) i&#039;m damn curious for him to stumble upon this thread though. that will be hilarious. where are you D4K?<br /><br />the rest goes to you guys.<br /><br />for reading SYG&#039;s BTC GIVEAWAY thread:<br /><br />the first foo from RIGHT NOW that messages me on the main SR site with &quot;BOOM!&quot; gets 2 shiny new bitcoins
