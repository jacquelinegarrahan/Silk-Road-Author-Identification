				Limitless, you wonder why you got your moderator status taken away.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never met anyone that is more of an egotistical moronic dickface than you are.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve been nothing but nice to you but you just ask for everyone to hate you

				Lol sweetheart would this be because I didn&#039;t agree with you trying to take vendors to school or would it because I told you to fuck off because of your dick comment on the other thread? <br /><br />And no I never wondered why the Mod status was taken away haha, that&#039;s what you seem to misunderstand. <br /><br />Also don&#039;t act like the &quot;I&#039;ve been nothing but nice to you&quot; shite, you happily got involved with that bullshit thread that popped up while I had a few days away. If you can&#039;t take it you shouldn&#039;t dish it out son. :)
