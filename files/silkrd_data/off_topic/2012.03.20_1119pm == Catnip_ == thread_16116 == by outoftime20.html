				I&#039;ve done some very, very thorough research on what would make the best plant base for spice. As far ass effects go, not flavor, catnip looks the best according to erowid experiences. I&#039;m still skeptical, and before I try any, I&#039;d like to get some opinions from people who have tried it. Does catnip really give a mild &#039;high&#039;? Is the taste worth it?

				Oh god I heard this way back when I was in highschool and a friend of mine used to bring it to parties. I tried it once and am convinced that everything he was saying was just placebo because nothing happened to me at all and it tasted nasty if I remember correctly.

				It *WILL* produce a mild buzz if you smoke enough, this is fact.&nbsp; This is extremely mild though and chances are you just won&#039;t want to smoke enough to feel it and its incredibly not worth it in the end.&nbsp; The tea may be a different story.<br /><br />
