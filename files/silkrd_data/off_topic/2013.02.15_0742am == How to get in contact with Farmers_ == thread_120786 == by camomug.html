				I was talking to my buddy and he said that there&#039;s ways on Tor to get into contact with farmers from Cali, Oregon, Colorado etc.&nbsp; He wouldn&#039;t really tell me how, but is there a place to find growers that sell at the prices they get over in those parts of the country? <br />I hear about all kinds crazy low prices on beautiful buds from the west part of the US would love to get in with that. I&#039;m assuming you need personal contacts though. SR has some nice prices on bud but the price is pretty much street prices, with the exceptional good deal here and there

				Damn pigs.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t you just ask for a phone number and address while you are at it?<br /><br />Heck in that part of the country its legalized anyway.. ?&nbsp; Why not just walk in and buy from a dispensary?<br /><br />Loser.<br />

				Damn, such hostility. Im not asking for any contacts, more of guidance. The pages on Tordir are mostly scammers and bullshit. He mentioned a legitimate growers site that had extremely good prices. I guess I&#039;ll try on irc and see if i can find good people for business.<br /><br />And no, where I&#039;m from I highly doubt it&#039;ll be legalized soon<br />...I just realized this sounds like an LEO post...no I&#039;m just looking to establish a long term contact. Was high and didn&#039;t think this post through yesterday. Sorry
