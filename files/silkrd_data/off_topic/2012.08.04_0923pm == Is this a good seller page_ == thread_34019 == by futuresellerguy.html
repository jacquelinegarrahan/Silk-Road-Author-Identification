				I just fished making this and will be making a sellers account. Can I get some opinions of this and anything I should change or add in:<br /><br /><br /><br />So I am brand new on SR as a seller, but I have been a buyer for a good amount of time. I have seen every way things can get shipped and I can tell you My method is 100 times better than anything currently out there.<br /><br />everything below is 100% true and will not be changed under any curcumstance.<br />Customer Service is of the utmost importance to me, so dont be afraid to shoot me a message.<br />You will not be dissapointed with an order from me<br />In the near future once I have enough feedback to show I am reputable I will be offering many different strains for unbeatable prices.<br />If you like my ad become a fan!<br />I promise I will do what it takes to please my coustomers fully!<br /><br /><br />**Please READ ALL below**<br />Please read. I will ignore questions that are already answered here.<br /><br />__________________________New Buyers __________________________<br /><br />New Buyers are Welcome!!!&nbsp; No message to me is necessary before making a purchase; if there are any issues, I’ll send you a message.<br /><br />If you need directions to get started than,<br /><br />First, go here: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/about<br />here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/<br />and here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/wiki<br />(the sites above can only be viewed through your TOR browser)<br /><br />That should start you off good.<br /><br />TIP: If the item is $100... then buy AT LEAST $115 worth of BTC accounting for exchange fluctuations and fees.<br /><br />--------------PAYMENT----------------------<br /><br />* I only accept bitcoins through SR, this is for both of our security.<br />* No Ukash, Paysafe, or any other payment method.<br />* I cant stress this enough, anonymity is everything to me.<br /><br /><br />__________________________Listings __________________________<br /><br />We are a retailer... not a wholesaler. We DO NOT offer listing&#039;s At this time for anything more than 1/8th. <br />In the near future I will be selling All weights, but at this time only 1/8ths.. No custom listings at this time. What is listed is what is available. <br />You&#039;ll have to order separately if you want to mix up the strains. We are not set up at this time to do custom orders like half-half or mixed variety. If it is NOT listed... it is NOT available. <br />Please see our current listings below. You can purchase them by adding the item(s) to your cart and then checking out.<br />I will ignore messages like &quot;when did you send my order?&quot; until at least 5 days after confirming shipment. If you write to me and I don&#039;t respond within 24 hours, it&#039;s because the answer is probably on here already. I usually respond within 12-24 hours. Please keep messages short and sweet. <br /><br /><br /><br />__________________________Shipping &amp; Handling __________________________<br /><br />No overnight, express or international shipping.<br /><br />Your order should arrive fluffy and uncompressed; this is NOT a guarantee. BUD can be compressed it really depends you might get them squished or not its really 50/50. . I have recieved packeges that looked like the mailman sat on the box, this is an example of something out of our control<br /><br />Address Advice (optional):<br />Make sure your address is correct by going to:<br />https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input<br />to check it. Copy and paste the results to me will help.<br /><br />No initials. See here: http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc1_007.htm<br /><br />I ship ONLY USA!!! I ship USPS First Class Priority Flat Rate Mail. A DCN (Delivery Confirmation Number) is on ALL packages. There is no extra charge for the DCN.. All orders ship within the same or next day (NOT including Fridays,Saturdays,Sundays or Holidays). All orders have a DCN for me to know if you received it or not. I will write EXACTLY what you tell me to write for the name and address. Bull shit names and/or addresses that cause a package to become undeliverable will be your responsibility and your loss. My experiences as a buyer on SR have been good. Frankly, I am amazed that some of the packages I ordered arrived at all considering the way they were packed and shipped. I think it may be due to the relaxed laws in some of the areas I ordered product from and they don’t take the extra precautions that others may take where the laws are stricter. That being said, your package will be handled with EXTRA ordinary care to ensure prompt and secure delivery. Expected delivery time is usually 2-5 days. Holidays and unexpected events (blizzard, floods, earthquakes, Tornado&#039;s) hold up the mail sometimes; out of my control. I’ve personally had some experiences on here myself, where I received the package within 2 days of ordering! Really depends on the mail system after the package has been dropped off.<br /><br />My shipping methods are The most professional and stealthy of anyone you will ever order from. Please do not say how it came because I do not want people to know my method, but it is 100% geurentee of not getting taken and should always arrive unlless lost in the mail.<br />I take my business very seriously and will never lie to you.<br /><br /><br />You carry all the risk once a package has been mailed.<br />If your package is stolen / lost - that is your risk.<br /><br />Tracking your package:<br />I will *NOT* track your package until 5 days after being marked in transit. Messages or emails about this will be ignored. The DCN is for myself or SR staff *ONLY* (if they require it). I will never give it out to you or anyone else for security reasons.<br /><br />Please no bad ratings for postal issues as this is not in my power.<br />I am here to fix any problem as fast as possible.<br /><br /><br />Once we can provide proof (via a DCN #) that a package has been shipped with the address you provide it is out of our hands... no refunds, period. <br /><br />If we have samples to give, we&#039;ll put them on SR like any other product. Otherwise please don&#039;t ask.<br /><br /><br />PLEASE no fake names for shipping!<br />PLEASE no shipping to an empty house or building!<br /><br /><br />****Addresses*****<br /><br />Please include your shipping information as follows:<br />( In this exact format)<br />First Name Last Name<br />12345 N. Street Blvd<br />City, State 12345<br /><br />* DO NOT expect a refund if you give me an incorrect/bogus address!<br /><br /><br />If your shipment doesn’t arrive, remember that it’s not easy for the sender.<br />Don’t just give me a negative review because of mail problems; it’s not my fault.<br />The packing I use is the best a person can do.<br />I am a reasonable dude and always want happy customers, so don&#039;t let the strict terms put you off doing business with me<br /><br />__________________________Refund Policy __________________________<br /><br />There are none! No refunds… period. This is not Wal-Mart; you&#039;re buying drugs on the internet. We do our job and take 100% responsibility all the way and expect our buyers to act the same. If *YOU* put down a wrong address... that&#039;s not my problem. If your neighbor steals your mail... then go buy a video camera because I don&#039;t care and I am not going to offer you a discount to replace it. I will *ALWAYS* have a DCN for tracking and if for some rare, odd, unimaginable moment, I don&#039;t have the DCN to prove shipment; then you&#039;ll get 100% refund.<br /><br />TIP: &quot;measure twice, cut once!&quot; Make sure your address is correct. Look at it. Is it correct? Apt # on there? Name spelled correctly? Did you verify your address? No initials. (see &quot;Address Advice&quot; above under the &quot;Shipping &amp; Handling&quot; section)<br /><br />All packages ship with DCN. If the DCN report shows the item as delivered I will not refund. If the package is returned due to a bad address/not being picked up at the PO, or anything else that is the buyer&#039;s responsibility, I will not refund. I am happy to work towards a resolution that is fair to all parties in other cases. **KEEP IN MIND I cut and paste all mailing addresses for labeling, so any typos in mailing are not going to be my fault.**<br /><br /><br />**WAYS TO GET YOUR BUYING ID ADDED TO THE SUSPICIOUS BUYERS LIST**<br />1. Ask me to take payment in anything other than btc<br />2. Ask me to do business outside of SR<br />3. Asking me where I am located<br />4. Feedback extortion. I&#039;ll turn you in to SR admin in addition to adding you to the bad buyers list.<br />5. Anything else that is just weird, creepy or bullshit<br /><br />__________________________Final Thoughts __________________________<br /><br />I have the right to refuse a sale for any reason I want and I don’t have to explain myself to you.<br /><br />A few things worth noting. Anonymity. Should go without saying… but I will say it anyway. Discretion and privacy are of the utmost importance. I’ve been accused of being “anal retentive” regarding this matter… which is good for you!!! Your info will be guarded safely and disposed of properly.<br /><br />Thank you very much!!!! I appreciate all your business!! Look forward to serving you here on the Silk Road!!!<br /><br /><br />---------------------FAQ-----------------------<br /><br />Q. Can you hold &quot;blah,blah&quot; strain for me until my bank transfer goes through to bitcoins?<br />A. No. I can&#039;t. No different than me taking your order and then holding it for 4 days before shipping it. Would you want me to do that to you? (That’s a rhetorical question) EXACTLY... you wouldn&#039;t. If something beyond your control goes wrong at the bank or BTC exchange, then I am left high and dry.<br /><br />Q. Can you loan me ?0.23 so that I can buy your product?<br />A. No dummy?!?! I appreciate that you bought BitCoins just to buy my product... but WTF? Don&#039;t get mad at me if I refuse. If the item is $100... then buy AT LEAST $115 worth of BTC accounting for exchange fluctuations and fees. If you can&#039;t afford it by however much than when you have enough money come back, I WILL NOT HELP YOU OUT. EVERYONE goes through the SAME EXACT procedures in 1 form or another; so complaining about how long it takes to go from purchasing BTC to the package arriving in the mail won&#039;t get you any sympathy from me. I also don&#039;t care if you live in the middle of nowhere and conducting business (ie. post office, bank, etc) for you is more challenging... MOVE!<br /><br />Q. Will you accept PayPal, Credit Card, Western Union, Money Gram, money order, cash, MoneyPak, etc?<br />A. No. Stop being stupid. If you think about it for a little bit... hopefully the light bulb in your brain goes off and you realize how dumb a question that is. BitCoins only.<br /><br />Q. Do you do dicounts<br />A. No.<br /><br />Q. How do I get BitCoins to buy your product?<br />A. see &quot;New Buyers&quot; section above<br /><br />Q. I have $59 (BTC equivalent) and I want to buy your $60 product... can you make a custom listing and just send me a little less?<br />A. No. If you can&#039;t afford it, then dont ask me about it.<br /><br />Q. I am a New Buyer. Do you want me to finalize early?<br />A. Yes all buyers with less than 5 Good transactions Must FE.<br /><br />Q)Do you mail to my country?<br />A) ONLY USA<br /><br />Q)How long will it take to get to my country?<br />A)I ONLY SHIP TO USA<br /><br />Q)Will i receive the same bud as in the photo?<br />A)No that is just a picture I took from someone elses post as my camera cant take a high enough resolution pict.<br /><br />Q)Do you accept cash?<br />A)No! ONLY BTC... No other currency accepted!<br /><br />Q)Do you accept Paypal, Ukash or Western Union?<br />A)No! ONLY BTC.<br /><br />Q)Where can I get Bitcoins?<br />A)Read the forum, ask on the forum or &#039;google&#039; it.<br /><br />Q)Do I have to encrypt my messages to you?<br />A)No, do not <br /><br />Q)Do you do resends or refunds?<br />A)No! You carry all the risk. *Important to note!<br /><br />Q:&quot;Can you add a small sample with my order?&quot;<br />A:No, all items are prepacked now, so I cant add anything else, or remove anything, so no custom orders.<br /><br />Q: I would like to make a purchase, will you send me a picture first?<br />A: No, my camera takes horrible bud pics, so I don&#039;t do pictures anymore<br /><br />Q:I see you have xx amount listed for $xx. I will give you xx for it right now.<br />A:Seriously? My prices are very reasonable and non-negotiable<br /><br /><br />I ALWAYS WEIGH HEAVY AND ADD A LITTLE EXTRA SO IF YOU CLAIM IT IS UNDERWEIGHT THAN YOU WILL NOT BE BELIEVED<br />

				Im not doing anything with PGP because its evil. Iv spent hours and hours learning it so I know I am using it correctly, but still whenever I tried to use it to purchase stuff somehow it didnt work. I gave up on it after 4 or 5 sellers told me that it wasn&#039;t correct. fucking mac laptop. Do u think that will really make people not want to buy from me?

				I don&#039;t know how secure this is (someone know?) and i honestly don&#039;t recommend it, but this is without doubt the easiest way to use PGP. <br /><br />https://www.igolder.com/pgp/
