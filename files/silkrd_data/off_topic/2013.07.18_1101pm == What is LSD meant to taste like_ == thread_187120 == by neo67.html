				It&#039;s supposed to be completely tasteless. If your &quot;LSD&quot; tastes chemically then get a reagent test kit, you are more than likely ingesting one of the many chemicals currently being passed off as LSD.

				LSD and taste is a sometimes heated subject. Technically LSD is not supposed to taste like anything at all. However, sometimes the LSD will be in or on a material that has taste. I have had LSD blotters that ranged in taste from almost nothing to making me want to puke from how bitter and chemical it tasted. I had bitter LSD from mostly reputable sources, and this was years ago before anybody online had any clue about nbome drugs. The people selling the bitter acid, which was extremely popular in Europe, gave a few explanations for the taste. One explanation was that it was the ink used on the paper, I don&#039;t really buy this though because the US GDF blotter never had taste, even stuff that wasn&#039;t WoW. Another explanation was that they used non-chlorine based blotter paper to minimize degradation of product once put on the paper, this excuse makes sense to me because chlorine neutralizes LSD as soon as it comes in contact with it, but I have no idea if that paper has such a strong chemical taste to it or not. The effects I have gotten from bitter LSD certainly felt like they were induced by an ergoloid, although the effects were perceived by many as being slightly different enough that it could have been an analog of some sort. Some of the blotters were actually lab tested and confirmed to have analog ergoloids on them, although this was seen as highly controversial. <br /><br />So in summary, LSD should have no taste to it, but if a blotter has a taste to it it may not certainly rule out it being LSD. I think that if liquid has a taste to it then it is more likely to not be LSD though, unless the taste is minty or the taste of alcohol or whatever.

				This was one of my biggest worries for a long time. That&#039;s why I was so happy to find SR, because now I know I&#039;m getting lsd and not research chemicals.<br /><br />For example, I have 10 of Haizenberg&#039;s hofmann blotters and because of the reviews I&#039;m expecting a bitter taste. I also know it&#039;s real LSD because the avengers tested it. If I had bought it off the street and it had a bitter taste I&#039;d instantly be worried.<br /><br />Basically what I&#039;m saying is, if you&#039;re worried about RCs then do some quick research on this site and order from somebody reputable. Or, as mentioned, buy a test kit.<br /><br />Cheers.

				yes but lsd with amphetamine analogs will test positive for lsd....the L is flavorless! but the speed isnt!

Still, I like those odds.

				At the doses normally consumed there should be no taste, if you taste anything it is the solvent or paper used.<br /><br />People who have actually eaten thumbprints(raw crystals, hundreds of doses) report that it has a bitter taste. You are unlikely to ever consume enough LSD at once to taste this.<br /><br />When I lay paper I use a mixture of pure ethanol and water for a solvent and I use 100% cotton paper without any chemicals on it. The result is a potent and tasteless blotter. If you can taste your blotter then you are tasting something other than LSD.

				It is a common misconception that LSD tabs are to be 100% tasteless. This is almost never the case. Yes, LSD in it self, is tasteless. The solvents used to lay the LSD crystal to the blotters on the other hand, is not. <br /><br />Ive been an avid LSD lover for more than a decade and ive yet to have a single hit of LSD thats entirely tasteless. Some less so than other, but if you have acute taste buds, there will always be some degree of taste to them. This is only the type of solvent used to lay the L that your tasting. In some cases if not the solvent it self, the ink/die on the blotters will give a slight taste as well.

The chemical itself has no taste, but when it is dissolved in a solvent and laid onto blotters, the solvent often gives it taste. Taste may SUGGEST one way or another, but a lab is the only way to know for sure. ;-)

Some such as Tess, have mentioned they have tuned in an exact ratio of solutions to give the final product as little taste as possible.
