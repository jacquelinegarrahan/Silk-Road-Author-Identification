				How do you envision DPR? A nerdy computer hacker? A suave James Bond? Perhaps a Girl Scout running this site between her homework? I hope we never find out, but it would be interesting to know the person behind the mask. What do you think the pirate looks like? Think he really wears a zorro mask?

				I met him once many years ago, for an interview and lunch....But alas just like the Stig, he hid his identity,&nbsp; how beautifully cryptic and so DPR I thought.&nbsp; This man left me captivated to be honest.&nbsp; His words, so dynamic so hypnotic...made me think to myself, &#039;I wonder if he&#039;s into the DynamicHypnotics&#039;.&nbsp; <br />.<br />Anyway apart from that, he had a turkey BLT for lunch, drinks cola by the truck load, umm he&#039;s roughly 5&#039;9 and it wouldn&#039;t hurt him to shed a few pounds.&nbsp; Also I noticed an he didn&#039;t chip in for the lunch, tips, nothing... bit of a disappointment really.&nbsp; <br />.<br />we love you DPR...

				I heard that if he were to punch you in the face you would have to fight off the urge to thank him, that panhandlers give him money, that when he drives off the lot in a new car it increases in value, that when in Rome they do as he does, that Google searches him, that when he goes to confession the priest confides in him, and that his personality is so magnetic he can&#039;t carry credit cards.<br /><br />I think he has pink hair, 3 live-in boyfriends, wears crocodile skin loafers, is very much into leopard print, drives a Mini Cooper, and is always holding his pet skunk FooFoo.&nbsp;

				Yeah she was ruthless, seen a few documentary&#039;s about her. Intriguing study she is, serving a big one now. She came from Cartagena, and was aligned with the Meddelin&nbsp; Cartel as opposed to the Cali.<br />She murdered many men, and turned |Miami into a battle ground. Small fact, she actually introduced the pillion passenger hit on a motorbike, or a tleast she was credited with it.

				Did I ever tell you about the time DPR forced me to wear a woman&#039;s bikini? Well anyway, DPR tears off my clothes and forces me to wear this skimpy bikini. For the next three months I had to conduct my business wearing only a woman&#039;s bathing suit. I would cry from shame and question my manhood daily, but Ill be damned if at the end of the quarter my sales hadn&#039;t tripled!<br /><br />DPR drives an ice cream truck covered in human skulls. He once ate the Bible while water skiing. He gave a handjob to a manta ray. He wears a live rattlesnake as a condom. He&#039;ll eat a homeless person if you dare him. He showers in grain alcohol. Every time he blinks, a star is created. He can regrow his own limbs...<br /><br />Oh wait, no that&#039;s Bill Brasky.

				I think she is a she. I guess she lives at the westcoast. Whashington state. Around 40 Years old and had her education at Berkely, Stanford. Her state of mind fits in San Fransisco. But the law there would try to put her on death-row. That is why I think she went up North and has her enterprise in Washington state.<br /><br />But L.E. is readindg with us, so I say she is from Canada. Vancoever or Adminton.<br /><br />A bookclub is something for women, like Oprah Winfry, not for men.<br /><br />I say DPR is a woman
