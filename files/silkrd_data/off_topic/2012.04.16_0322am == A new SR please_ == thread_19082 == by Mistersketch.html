				I dont post to much in these forums mostly lurk and hang on other parts of the darkweb however I feel as if SR has taken TOR really out to the next level, I have been following SR ever since it came out last year in february and have to say that the quality of the overall population has really gone downhill<br /><br />I propose that someone else should make a newer version of SR perhaps more private and not as advertised as silkroad, anyone have any coding knowledge? ive got connections for tor servers and would love to make another one with the same ideas of escrow and such, or maybe someone else should do it <br /><br />with the amount of attention DPR Is screaming for with all the sales he puts up there has to be someone else out there looking to make the money he does!!!!???? sheesh there is no competition out there for this guy straight up raping the market!!! <br /><br />I mean blackmarket reloaded is there but come on be real that site hardly is on SR&#039;s radar, there should be another SR for more choice!!!! SR is getting really popular and im sure that some of you out there know that all good things come to an end given it gets enough eyes pointing in that direction<br /><br />Ill pay BTC for a coder who can do what SR did :) lets get this started <br /><br />edit:<br />ALMOST FORGOT <br />TL;DR<br /><br /><br />Sr raping market no competition. SR getting to popular dont you agree? Need more private and equally as legitimate as SR, Can you code a site similar to SR with escrow and such? I will pay BTC for it and for continuous service <br />

				You mention BMR while dismissing it out of hand as being &quot;hardly on SR&#039;s radar&quot;.&nbsp; What makes you think other sites would fare any better?<br /><br />Incidentally, what&#039;s the score with BMR?&nbsp; Does anyone know why is it so unpopular, compared to SR?

Give BMR a bit of time and it should catch up if it&#039;s ran properly. The guy who runs it is a little bit prickly compared to DPR who is a PR don so I think that&#039;s one of the reasons why it&#039;s quite slow. Saying that there seems to be less control over at BMR for example you have people advertising hits on people, wider range of straps than at The Armory. Sales wise I&#039;ve had 2 so far but yano, every little helps. :) <br /><br />Also at the OP you just sound like one of those guys who says &quot;Yeah man, I was there at the beginning, that was when blow jobs were done properly, not like now when blow jobs are shit. They just don&#039;t get what blow jobs are all about these days.&quot; So what is SR if getting bigger, it&#039;s a good thing. Having some sort of exclusive SR seems to be exactly the opposite of what SR is all about which is surely the ability for anyone who makes the conscious choice to experiment with drugs the ability to buy said drugs at a premium quality as safely as possible. Why bring elitism into something that is supposed to be exactly the opposite to that?

				hey all thanks for the replies it was all nice to read and some expected some not <br /><br />as for having anything against anyone I dont, I just like options and it sucks that there isnt any other market to the comparison of SR, everyone seems to have the same sentiment in that when things get to popular its when things tend to go out of hand so it would be nice to have another option incase things do go south, <br /><br />dont get me wrong DPR great dude and this idea of his is awesome I use SR often and it is a great place to be, however, with the growth I have noticed that it has brought on crowds of all types both good and bad, well I am pretty proud of being apart of SR it has been great to watch everything happen and how the market has evolved since the beginning, DPR is a sensible person and I think his way of reacting to the changes is why SR Is the way it is today, as for BMR ive never used the site as ive heard the same about the admin options are always nice and it would be great to see another venue with a person who is as sensible as DPR, <br /><br />I just feel that there is room for competition and if there were another site like SR just a little more strict in who to bring into the site that would be real cool to and id love to take part in that, <br /><br />So offer still stands on anyone that can code Im sure we can work out a number that will us both happy, as for bringing on the big players it happened for SR so maybe with time someone can have the same luck, <br /><br />my 2 cents on private sites is maybe they exist but everytime I hear anything about it there is a scammer trying to rip someone to invite them or saying they are listed on these &quot;private invite sites&quot; to make themselves look better during a scam, all in all SR is the only one of its kind money is there to be had, look at the 420 prizes for fucks sake!!!<br /><br />thanks for reading :) all posts welcome !!!

				Yo MisterSketch I hope I didn&#039;t come off too strong on my last post. I can just be a little direct.<br /><br />Just out of interest what criteria would you impose for acceptance for a new SR? I&#039;m inquisitive on how you&#039;d screen people.

				I think the current SR is fine but then again I&#039;ve only been around less than a month. Maybe they should just add a VIP section where you pay maybe 50BTC/year that gets split with SR management/vendors and all VIPs gets priority shipments, best deals, VIP listings, etc.

				Welcome to SR jolly!! <br />Im sure it has been a great time in the month youve been trust me it only gets better!, as for the payment per year thing it is a good idea but at the same time I dont think anyone would be interested in paying more than what they do with BTC<br /><br />SR really has made it awesome with escrow and hedge, but given that the BTC price is Way more stable than what it was a year ago I do not think it would be as necessary as it was when it first started, Escrow is the biggest feature of darkweb, as everyone can see what happens when people go out of it so a site that resembles SR with an admin that is as readily available as SR would give him a good run for his money granted it would take time but a market driven by drugs I really dont see much chance for failure other than rippers, but SR Still stands today after all it has gone through<br /><br />As for a screening process maybe that cant happen but the forums are here and the validity and thought out responses would give big weight on an invite and from there I could give that one person more invites to give out to personal and trusting friends, <br /><br />SR doesnt seem to mind having a nice bright sign on the top of its store and I feel that one day, even with the protection of tor and bitcoins, higher up people might have to respond, its just the way things work, SR has been around a year and a half now, In internet time that is Very long, right about now would be a great time for a new venue to arise, <br /><br />Just needs a catchy name :)<br /><br />edit:<br />also I wish i had the knowledge to do it because i would in a heart-beat, if someone out there does id suggest it!!!!

				I think this is a good idea. What if Sr gets shut down I hope DPR has a backup that would be fucking awesome like lights out SR is shutdown by the fbi/dea... Welcome to SR 2.0!!!!! Speaking on your dream of a&nbsp; site, I feel the more legit anon markets the more the dream continues, if its BMR or fucking Johns Candy Land. Although Sr like you said is having a lot of popularity and all walks are coming here, this is also bringing vendors and buyers and continued growth. This may sound stupid and its late but DPR is like Martin Luther of the oppression of drugs, the people who choose to use drugs and the war on drugs. And like Martin Luther&nbsp; inspired people to stand up against the machine and oppression, I feel this site will do the same.<br /><br />Its SR in 2012 but SR, BMR, XMR, TRYR, POPRE, YUO, ARR, HHH,XTC, COKA, MUTHAFUCKING ANON NIK NAC DRUUUGGGS Drugs for freedom, Anon drugs ect in 2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019.<br /><br />Mister do your damn thing and expand.<br /><br />Fuck the oppression and telling the people what is right and wrong all while screaming bullshit how free America is, then we lock our non violent citizens up in a cage like animals for smoking a joint or enjoying some LSD or even meth and H.

				It&#039;s always the newbies who want to close the door and lock it after they enter their little wonderland of drugs. Personally, you can go fuck yourself OP. <br />Also, in case you don&#039;t know, these sites don&#039;t last very long anyway so your precious little sanctuary will be gone eventually so you might have to grow a pair of nuts and get your drugs off the street like most people.&nbsp;

				Well if there mpore succesful markets like SR it would certainly make investigation for LE a lot harder. But would I buy on annother market if it had the same products at the same price as SR? Probably not...I have come to love this community,many great people on here who think like me. Perhaps you find the niveau of the SR community has dropped cos in the last time there have been a LOT of people joined that are terrible in English.
