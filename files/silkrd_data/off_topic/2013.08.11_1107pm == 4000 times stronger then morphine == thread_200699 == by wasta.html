				I came along a article about a frog. <br /><br />http://www.earth-matters.nl/171/7881/sjamanisme-en-natuurvolken/kambenocirc-wondermedicijn-uit-de-amzone.html<br /><br />Translate if you want to read. The article is in Dutch...<br /><br />. Dermorphin en deltorfine zijn potente opioïde peptiden en 4.000 keer sterker dan morfine en 40 keer sterker dan endogene b-endorfine. (1).
