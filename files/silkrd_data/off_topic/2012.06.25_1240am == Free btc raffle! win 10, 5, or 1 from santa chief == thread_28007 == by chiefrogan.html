				ok guys- going out with a bang here. ive had extra coins that i didnt need to spend so ive been hooking people up. my H friends a few i give them the chance to try Nod&#039;s sample tar (the price is right and its bomb). also others who pm me that they are short some amount for their order. its been great feeling to be able to do this and give back to our lovely community.<br /><br />now with the last of my coins i present a raffle style prize! just post in here and i will assign a number to you. after 24 hours, give or take, i will find a way to randomize the numbers and choose lucky winners! atleast one prize of 10, 5, and 1 btc... or hopefully a few of each depending on some people pending to get some coin from me. ok sound good? :D<br />i guess i have to rule- certain amount of posts/history to be eligible (i choose) and if ive already hooked you up its prob not too fair ok?<br /><br />love you all and so joyful to be doing this for you my friends. good luck and peace to your hearts!

				Yes, you gotta be in to win it!<br /><br />I&#039;m not a heroin user so if I win that you can pass me by!<br /><br />but coin, boy oh boy I need some coin after , well, we all have those financially challenging periods. You know - were you cannot afford to get coke!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So I&#039;m in it - and just to cheer everyone up here is a funny story......<br /><br />Some new guy works with me. There are like a gang of us worked for years. Even the boss goes way back.<br /><br />So the new guy is caught in the toilet smoking a joint of (shit) hash.<br /><br />We wind him up and one of the lads says the boss is coming in to deal with the &#039;incident&#039; (we pretended it was a big thing him being caught)<br /><br />The boss winds the guy up, then tells him if he ever bring hash to work, what should he do???<br /><br />The new guy says &quot;Throw it in the toilet&quot;<br /><br />The boss told him to only ever bring good hash in or ask one of the lads if he cannot get any. <br /><br />We called him a bastard for not sharing, but ticked him off for not knowing good hash from bad.<br /><br />This weekend we take him out and will get him more stoned than Keith Richards<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />PS - I&#039;ll kiss you French style for 20 BTC&nbsp; &nbsp;;)
