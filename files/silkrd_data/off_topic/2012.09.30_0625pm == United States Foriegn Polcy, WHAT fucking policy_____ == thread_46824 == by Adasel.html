				Sorry for this rant, but some american on another forum made a comment about the anti islamic video that was posted on Youtube last week and was like, why are those guys in the middle east getting so mad??.<br /><br />I mean seriously what the fuck?.<br />I am not anti american, but honestly their government has a a lot to answer for.<br />They get involved in wars they have no reason to be in, and for what?.&nbsp; Either money or oil and afterwards the country is left in a fucking shambles every time.<br />Americans need to get a grip on their so called &quot;foreign policy&quot; bullshit and realise they dont actually have one.<br />No wonder most of the middle east is pissed of with america.<br />Sorry, just a point of view.

				I hear what you are saying OP. One would wonder what business the American Government has invading a lot of the countries it invades.<br /><br />I read a book recently called &quot;The Confessions of an Economic Hitman&quot;. I&#039;d highly recommend it. It is very enlightening and it explains the real agenda of the American Government and how they achieve their objectives; and it comes from someone who was involved in their agenda.<br /><br />Here is an interview with the author of the book, it is long but interesting:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTbdnNgqfs8<br /><br />Enjoy :)

				I agree, we don&#039;t have a foreign policy right now except for....&quot;We&#039;re sorry...we suck.&quot; -Obama<br /><br />We gave the taliban $43 million in 2000 to help eradicate heroin production in afghanistan....that worked out well. <br /><br /><br />But seriously....we&#039;re only about 70 years removed from WWI and WWII....has europe and the middle east forgotten that already?&nbsp; You&#039;re welcome, world. <br /><br />But as far as the middle east goes, we should just GTFO and let those morons take eachother out like they have been since the beginning of time. Israel is the best possible insurance policy we have over there, as they are sure to launch a full-on blitz as soon as they even get a SNIFF of any weapons grade uranium emanating from Iran....

				The movie created and serviced just for cause an unconscious and primitive reaction from fanatic muslims...and unfortunately it worked.It&#039;s true,there is no doubt islam religion is one of the most dangerous monsters.But this monster didn&#039;t created and grown by itself.The decision makers in USA and Europe have feeded and watched the monster always when it was eating innocent people alive...and many of ordinary&nbsp; people in there just turned to blinds and ignored.Maybe that aggressive,primitive and poor people just want to be a matter of concern and cry for help with some way subconsciously,and maybe they cried too much this time...and there is no doubt the decision makers are looking forward to help this poor people and they will bring freedom to muslim people as soosn as possible,like they&#039;ve done in Iraq and many other places...freedom with no life,it&#039;s free enough :) And lastly, just follow the courses in Syria.The decision makers are supporting&nbsp; the most fanatic islamic groups and el-kaide like terrorists&nbsp; in there...now.

				Doooo iiiiit, because like it or not, it&#039;s become a little piece of history. Just like Terry Jones and his fanaticism, The Innocence of Muslims in all it&#039;s hilarihorridness gets to join in on the fun!<br /><br />A link for your convenience, obviously clearnet warning. <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAiOEV0v2RM<br /><br />Also fun fact, the creator of this video is a Coptic Christian, which if you know anything about Coptic relations it gives a meager backstory to this hilaritarded crap of hunk.<br /><br />As for the rest of the rumours permeating through this thread, it was not necessarily the movie that the militant protests over, it&#039;s the fact that the militant factions now have a good excuse to rile up the populace to protest and attack the United States. We&#039;ve seen the same with the Dutch, wherein Theo Van Gogh was killed for his depiction of Muhammad. What wasn&#039;t accounted for was the racial troubles occurring at the same time that oppressed and angered the populace. Obviously I&#039;m not defending wanton destruction and murder, but the world isn&#039;t as black and white as the media likes to think it is.

				&quot;False Flag Operations&quot;<br /><br />The U.S. is infamous for these type of maneuvers. <br /><br />What the bigger story was at the same time of these Arab riots in multiple countries was the announcement from the Federal Reserve for QE3 - Which, planned, only received roughly 5% of the media coverage. What this means is that the Federal Reserve is going to print money out of thin air to buy up mortgages and loan out interest free liquidity to U.S. Major banks. It has happened twice in U.S. history and had a limit towards the amount the FED could print. This time for QE3 might be called QEInfinity since it was announced there will be no limit on the amount they print. <br /><br />Quantitative Easing. <br /><br />Do you REALLY think that a YouTube movie caused a riot in multiple Islamic states? Lol. <br />

				The funny thing is StExo, Islam promotes learning and specifically in science. I&#039;m guessing Mohammed didn&#039;t think the theory of evolution would ever be discovered but him and his Son-in-law were pretty intelligent for their time. I think what Mohammed was going for when he created Islam, was a religion that adopted virtues from every major religion on the planet to convert as many people as possible--which is why most of Islam&#039;s back-story is based on Christianity and Judaism but the same problems comes forth.<br /><br />Science has far surpassed any explanations that religion has provided, so what the fuck, why are we still believing in this bullcrap? Oh yeah, it&#039;s needed to euthanize the masses in the current setting of the world. We need all the ignorant workers to believe in a religious ideology so they don&#039;t revolt or commit &quot;sin&quot; to escape their abject poverty. Hopefully when technology evolves a bit and we switch over to a better way of generating energy than by use of fossil fuels, we&#039;ll get there... which is planned to happen around 2035.<br /><br />Sadly, lots of death and destruction lie between now and then. Oh, how amazingly eventful our lifetimes will become &gt;:D

				Hi there marksum, your post is very interesting indeed.<br />I dont think its just the usa but uk also, do not forget its now a coalition force, so i guess everyone wants a piece of oil.<br />You are defiantly right about the roads being neglected.&nbsp; Every year here in the uk road works spring up all over the place, it seems, just as christmas approaches.&nbsp; Are there really problems with the roads or are they hoping we wont notice they are just making excuses for their big fat wage slips.<br />They are saying that there are so many deaths a year involving road workers and yet i have not heard or seen any evidence whatsoever of this.&nbsp; I am not paranoid, i just make sure i keep as up to date on local and global news when i can.<br />As for the army, I am just wondering what country they are going to hit next. <br />Supposedly we are in this massive economic crisis and im guessing its not going to be long before an oil rich country is going to be hit.<br />I can understand when people believe there are those who sit behind the curtains who a really in control, espeically when you have a pair like bush and blair illegally executing an invasion for the simple reason of oil, even though it was never publicly stated.<br />What lies down the road in the next 5 years or less, is anybody&#039;s guess.

				First off, I&#039;m an American. I find it absolutely ridiculous that the media has been reporting this &quot;video&quot; as a major cause of the rioting. Here are my reasons:<br /><br />- The Arab spring has been going on for years. How can you differentiate between the previous riots and this one? <br />- One of CNN&#039;s field reporters asked rioters whether or not they have heard of this video, most of them have not heard of it, and an even smaller percentage saw it. <br />- Most of the rioters are between the ages of 15-25. These riots are caused youth immaturity manifested in the form of violence. There were Riots in Vancouver after they lost a hockey game to Boston, there were riots in LA after the Lakers lost the championship. Kids will riot for the most stupid of reasons because they are looking for an excuse to riot. There is a song, prominent in the early 2000s called &quot;Let&#039;s Go Riot&quot; by Three Days Grace. This is an example of rebellious youth culture. <br />-- My point is, these riots aren&#039;t fueled by anger over a stupid video made by a stupid filmmaker; the fact that this man calls himself a filmmaker is more of an insult to Hollywood than it is to Islam. The Arab Spring has never been about Islam, it has been about freedom.<br /><br />Why is the media, and the US government, attempting to dismiss these riots as Islamic rage over a video?<br />- There was a terrorist attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, originally, both Hillary Clinton and Obama dismissed this attack as a result of these &quot;riots&quot; even though local authorities informed the state department immediately after the attack that it was indeed a terrorist attack. Why? Because Obama&#039;s election is in two months. Having a terrorist attack on his watch would be disastrous. The US government manufactured the idea that some Youtube video caused riots, and in turn, those rioters that caused the explosion at the embassy killing the US ambassador. <br /><br />Obama&#039;s logic behind this manufactured story: <br />- If rioters caused the explosion at the embassy, then terrorists did not. If terrorists did not attack the embassy, then Obama served his first term without a terrorist attack against the United States.<br />-- The problem is, the local authorities made it public that this was a terrorist attack, undermining the campaign&#039;s plan. But, Obama being a man made of Teflon, was able to come out clean, as always.<br /><br />This is my opinion of what has been happening. Hopefully I am wrong.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />On &quot;Muslim rage&quot;:<br />- Conservative Muslims have this idea that they are immune from criticism. This idea is ridiculous. These conservative Muslims caused a reporter in Italy to be put into their equivalent of the witness protection program because he depicted the prophet Muhammad in his magazine. The animated series &quot;Southpark&quot; was going to do a parody on Muhammad, but the channel which Southpark is on, Comedy Central, forbid Southpark from portraying Muhammad in such a manner. Similarly, the animated series &quot;Family Guy&quot; was going to depict Muhammad, but Fox, forbid Family guy from using Muhammad as a character in their series. In Scandinavia, a newspaper did a comic strip with Muhammad in it, the artists, the publisher, the newspaper employees, all received death threats. Westerners&#039; have become so scared of offending Muslims that we are censoring our favorite programs, newspapers and magazines just to appease some irrational Muslims who hold the belief that their religion is immune to criticism. To those Muslims, I say this: Fuck you and your unrealistic ideals.<br />- That&#039;s not to say that the riots in the middle east are caused by Muslim rage from the video. As I said before, Most Muslims haven&#039;t seen it. They cannot be angry at something they haven&#039;t seen.<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />Vote Ron Paul

What I am doing is thinking ahead. In 20-30 years, will it turn out that getting rid of Saddam was a good idea? Will Iraq be a functioning, tolerant democracy with a strong economy and trade? Will the Middle East have moved away from this continuous capitulation to dictatorship and become a stable region once again?<br /><br />Or will it prove to have been a terrible decision and made the region infinitely worse, irreparably worse perhaps? Point is I don&#039;t buy that it&#039;s as simple as &quot;war is bad&quot;. And living in the Middle East certainly isn&#039;t a good enough reason to claim justification for that certainty.

I&#039;d hazard a guess that the Kuwaitis weren&#039;t too annoyed by it either, to say the least.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to come across as pro-war because in general I&#039;m really not. What I am doing is thinking ahead. In 20-30 years, will it turn out that getting rid of Saddam was a good idea? Will Iraq be a functioning, tolerant democracy with a strong economy and trade? Will the Middle East have moved away from this continuous capitulation to dictatorship and become a stable region once again?<br /><br />Or will it prove to have been a terrible decision and made the region infinitely worse, irreparably worse perhaps? Point is I don&#039;t buy that it&#039;s as simple as &quot;war is bad&quot;. And living in the Middle East certainly isn&#039;t a good enough reason to claim justification for that certainty. Many people who live in your region disagree with you, are they wrong to be glad of the American presence?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Americans didn&#039;t want to enter the 2nd World War. They were much opposed to it and WWI. It was only after Pearl Harbor that the gov had the support of the people. Pearl Harbor was not bombed by the Japanese without reason. We were cutting off the Japanese supply of oil and they were left with few options.<br /><br />As Americans it is very easy for us to praise WWII as that is what boosted us to the top of the heap. What would have come of Germany had we not joined in? They would have been crushed by the Russians anyways, but if not, I doubt they would be any more of a cancerous bully to our planet then the USA is at the moment.<br /><br />WWII is not some simple example of why war is sometimes necessary. American and British alike have a very skewed perspective of war. We love watching the bombs drop from our armchairs at home. We love beer commercials that talk about supporting our troops. We love plastering ribbons and flags all over our cars.<br /><br /><br />As to your comments on the Kurds: Do you know who gave Saddam the chemical weapons he used to gas large populations of Kurds? Yeah, America. We had given them to him to kill millions of Iranians, but he used some on a side project. <br /><br />Some of the opinions here are very strong about the validity of sending young men to a far away land to kill other young men. The things we are doing are going to come back to bite us, as a nation. War is horrible.

				On WW2 first of all..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how you can claim with any certainty that Russia would have crushed Germany anyway. That seems like a nonsensical stretch at best, I&#039;m sorry to have to say, and one that I can&#039;t really see how you can be basing on any sort of empirical evidence. Considering that to make such an assertion, you have to dismiss the initial events and begin somewhere mid-war in this hypothetical timeline without any regards for the real world causality of it.<br /><br />The war was a certainty at the very least to involve Germany, the UK and France ever since the Gleiwitz debacle and the Polish defeat at Buzra. As it happens the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was signed before this ever happened anyway so I cannot see on what grounds you are formulating your opinion of the German-Soviet relationship.<br /><br />Tell me, what were Britain and France supposed to do? Make nonsense of their pact with Poland, even after Hitler&#039;s betrayal of his already blackmailed conclusion of simply keeping the Sudetenland due to its &quot;German&quot; inhabitants and not the rest of the region which he then claimed his own? He could not be trusted in terms of treaties and it simply won&#039;t do to trace back to the treaty of Versailles and say &quot;oh well it was our fault anyway&quot; and ignore the actuality of the fact that this psychopath probably wouldn&#039;t have stopped when conflict was seen as inevitable, and it was JUST to forcefully stop him. Regardless of at what point the Americans got involved.<br /><br />Nazi Germany would have been no more cancerous than the USA is at the moment? Jesus Christ, I&#039;ve seen some masochism in my time but fucking hell.. Look, the USA is a corporate circle-jerk that has an aggressive military-industrial complex, no-one can possibly deny this. But it is also a place where you have relative freedom. And there is of course still racism.. But mainly, it&#039;s a pretty good place to live for a 21st century human, even if it is run by big business. And you&#039;re saying that this is just as cancerous as a government that openly sent millions of people on trains to be gassed and murdered? You can&#039;t possibly see these things as points of indifference. To say &quot;the Russians would have beat him, but if not, it doesn&#039;t matter because America is just as bad&quot; is absolutely ridiculous and considering it&#039;s a point of righteousness you&#039;re making, as in &quot;America is as bad as Nazi Germany,&quot; - I don&#039;t think you can be morally serious and make such a statement, at least not with a straight face. That&#039;s a ridiculous comparison and one that you shouldn&#039;t be throwing around because it discredits any points of specificity concerning American foreign policy that you COULD actually make.<br /><br />And this whole thing about us giving Saddam the weapons. Right, so because America gave him the weapons (under an entirely different context which I don&#039;t defend but I must stress was unrelated to the issue of Kurdistan and Northern Iraq), we then have no right to say &quot;you can&#039;t use those weapons to indiscriminately kill hundreds of thousands of people in an attack devoid of any policy&quot;. Those weapons were sold to Saddam during the Iraq-Iran war. I&#039;m not going to defend that, it was a dumb decision made by a fucking moron called Ronald Reagan but are we to say that because he sold the weapons to him, we have no right to criticize the later use of those weapons? Again, this is nonsense.<br /><br />The same is true with Bin Laden. The US armed him under the context of allowing the Afghans the chance to fight against the Soviet invasion of their country (which they had every right to). He wasn&#039;t radicalized at that point and it wasn&#039;t obvious that he was then going to attack the US. The same people that say &quot;The US armed Bin Laden&quot; are the same people that will then turn around and say that 9/11 was an inside job and that Bin Laden doesn&#039;t even exist, almost in the same breath. <br /><br />And I say this as someone that is by no means &quot;comfortable with war&quot;. I don&#039;t sit at home gleefully watching bombs fall on foreign countries. What I do say is that I am nowhere near educated enough to have a view of the bigger picture. What I do know has come from my education and my own research over the years but in terms of the totality of the happenings on this planet I know NOTHING and neither do you.<br /><br />It&#039;s time we all admitted that just because you&#039;ve heard some soundbites from some anti-war journalists that you ascribe to or read some websites on history does not mean that you actually know anything. <br /><br />And we can&#039;t simply elevate the idea of &quot;peace&quot; to a ridiculous castle-in-the-sky level. You can only have peace if everyone wants to be peaceful. You can&#039;t simply say &quot;peace&quot; in the face of some of the horrors of this world. If I put you in the middle of Liberia or the Congo with your wife and a few guns, you just see how long it is before you resort to killing someone.<br /><br />Or are you going to say &quot;let&#039;s have peace&quot; when you&#039;re having your limbs cut off and watching her getting gang raped and beaten to a pulp? (this is not sensationalism, it happens daily). Truth is, sometimes you just have to kill the assholes, otherwise you are going to get killed yourself. Even Gandhi understood this much. And I do believe this applies to nation states too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If you see similarities between America and Nazi Germany then surely you must think that WW2 was just! I was simply showing you that in certain cases, such as the Nazi situation which you argued against, war is just, and if anything, desirable (compared to the consequences if pacifism is taken)<br /><br />Out of curiosity where are you from? I&#039;m not pro-America by the way. The government I mean (I dont think anyone here is). The country itself is an amazing place. I&#039;d just like to think I&#039;m at least being realistic about it. For example there is no persuasive evidence for the idea that 9/11 was committed by the US government/Mossad. I have heard literally all the arguments from both sides and if you&#039;re going to quote discredited scientists talking about thermite, and say things like &quot;there&#039;s a frame missing on the pentagon tape. therefore missile&quot; then I&#039;ve heard it all before. But seriously I&#039;m interested in what evidence you have for this notion.
