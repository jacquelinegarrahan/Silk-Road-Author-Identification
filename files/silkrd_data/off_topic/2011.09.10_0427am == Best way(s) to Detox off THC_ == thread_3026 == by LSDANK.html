				Step one, exercise! Eat lots of fiber, drink lots of juice, green tea, and water. <br /><br />In order to consume lots of fiber, and the purpose of eating fiber is to shit out the THC. There&#039;s only two was of thc leaving your system..&nbsp; piss, or out in your bowels. By eating foods that are high in fiber, and vitamin C content, and other essential vitamins and minerals, all those thc molecules are purged from the body. Most of it just sits in your gut.. Speed up that metabolism... You can make you a shake every morning, add carrot juice as the base, add 1 1/2 bananas, add boiled spinach, and even an avocado. Blend all of that, and enjoy a tasty well balanced meal =) <br /><br />You can also drink about 2-3 cups of green tea, which help in speeding up the detox process by helping to flush out the thc, and other things, such as free radicals, that shouldn&#039;t be in your body by speeding up the metabolism as well. <br /><br />Make sure that shake is the first thing you consume in the morning.. You can also purchase garlic, and eat a clove or two every morning.. before the shake.. This helps detox the blood =) <br /><br />Stay away from any meat.. white meat or red meat.... just do lots of veggies =) <br /><br />Other foods that are high in fiber are walnuts, and other nuts.. Brown rice (not white rice!)... <br /><br />In two weeks, you should be pretty much cleansed, and ready for a drug test =)

				Here&#039;s a helpful message about THC detoxification that I saved from some forum:<br /><br />&quot;Im a Dr of Pharmacy and Im going to put it to you straight. All of the products they sell at GNC, Vitamin Shop, &amp; Health food stores are absolute wastes of your money. If you are a small time user 1-2 times per month and have low body fat you should be clean within 2 weeks. If you are a chronic user it could take up to 6 weeks to detox. The metabolites of THC are lipid soluble, they are stored in fat cells. The individuals metabolism and exercise habits can make a difference in excretion of metabolites. A skinny person who exercises a lot and uses infrequently can test negative 3 days after using. A heavy person who doesnt exercise is in a bit of a bind. All those herbal extracts mentioned are now tested for first, before testing for illegal drugs, and may be considered by some labs to be a positive immediately. Some will forward it on for gas chromography analysis and a mass spectrography assay which will then find the metabolites you have tried to mask. <br /><br />Now I can tell you as a user and Pharmacist who conducted an experiments in a lab what does and doesnt work. The herbal masking agents do not work and will cause you more trouble then they are worth and will waste your money as well. You must detox using water. Large amounts of water must be ingested starting at least 36 hours before the test, up to 1 liter per 14.25kg of body weight per 24 hours. You must also supplement with creatine monohydrate, a bodybuilding supplement found in healthfood stores, at a rate of 1 teaspoon per 14.25kg of bodyweight. Just mix it with your liters of water. A prescription diuretic called Furosemide should also be added to ths water/creatine therapy at a dosage of 1 mg per kg of body weight per day administered in 2 doses. AM and Afternoon. When a specimen is examined they look for the diluteness of the sample by checking creatinine ( a byproduct of muscle metabolism) levels. Supplementing with creatine causes a sample taken after heavy water consumption to look as if normal creatinine levels are present. The diuretic which is very strong helps to flush the toxic and excess fluids from your body. Its like getting an oil change of sorts. THC metabolites may be present in your fat cells but you are essentially a faucet when you donate your specimen. The day of your test you should avoid excess physical activity and drink the water and creatine mixture and use the furosemide as stated above. You should also take Super B complex vitamins as well as vitamin C several times on the day of your test. This will provide color to the urine so that it does not appear as dilute. When you donate, urinate for a short time then hit the cup about 1/2 way through urination. This is so anything in the urethra is expelled prior to donation. Cranberry exctract may be added to the detox therapy above if you are concerned about kidney function while using the creatine monohydrate. I have been a regular smoker, 10-15 times per month, in average shpe, and used the above program to pass a screening exactly 7 days of no use. My colleagues have also used this method to test negative in screening. You may want to practice this several times, without the Furosemide. Follow the water and creatine method for 36-48 hours then get a clear glass and urinate in it as directed. Hold it up to the light and you should see the excess creatine monohydrate that has not been absorbed by the body floating in the urine like a suspension. Take your vitamins and repeat this process again. If you get a call from the testing agency inquiring about the creatinie in yoru urine simply tell then that you lift weights and jog and do use performance supplements. Good luck, this process has worked for many health care professionals who like to puff. That is why my colleagues and I set out to decifer a way to &quot;pee clean&quot;. Good luck.&quot;<br />

				Synthetic urine works best but only if you are allowed to give the sample without prying eyes watching. Most pre-employment drug screens are private but probation or parole drops are usually watched. Kinda up to your situation. Nothing I know of that can allow you to toke up regularly then give your own urine and be clean.

				Yes truly a saver when no one is watching you. I might be watched not sure yet tho so dont know if i wanna go that method just yet. That is true gonna have to make an effort not to smoke sometimes.. Although there are some pretty good detoxes that can work as ive heard need to do more research. but definitely wont be able to smoke as much as i would want to.&nbsp; &nbsp; Somebody just told me of a detox called &quot;USB&quot; urine saliva blood, detox apparently its a life saver when it comes to coming out clean on test and works real well dont know my self anyone heard of it?

				This is something I have had to research a lot and just like ravenhawk said there is no detox product solution period.&nbsp; The only reason people have had success with any of those products (WHICH ARE ALL SCAMS) is because they tell you to drink lots of water in the instructions which dilutes the thc metabolite rate below 50ngs per ml.&nbsp; Dilution is the only way other than to bring clean urine with you and keep it the right temperature which is the way to go when you are not supervised.&nbsp; If you are supervised there is a product called the whizzinator which has&nbsp; a wasteband with a piss pouch and a small hose with a little clip.&nbsp; It is sold as a &quot;urine fetish kit&quot;.&nbsp; I advise not to use the synthetic urine because some can be detected.&nbsp; Fill with clean urine, wrap around wast (which keeps urine right temp) and tape the little hose down your back and.... you know.&nbsp; You can easily use it even with johnny law breathing down your neck.&nbsp; Dilution is a pain in the ass and you will still worry if it worked but with this you can laugh all the way home.

				All of the &quot;detox remedies&quot; are sketchy at best. As someone said earlier the only way to possibly beat a DT for real is dillution and supplements if you have recently smoke (cuz lets get real all other drugs are out in like two days). Also a whizzinator is a waste too because it&#039;s obvious for a supervised test and an overly expensive waste for an unsupervised test. NO ONE PISSES WITH A RAGING HARD ON! Substitution is IMO the best way to beat a DT. If it&#039;s supervised it will be tough but possible. <br /><br />1.Wear Briefs. Crotch a travel shampoo bottle that&#039;s TSA approved it&#039;s like 2.5 Oz filled with clean urine. The spouts can be opened silently and it sounds right going into the cup. <br /><br />2. The real trick is to &quot;try&quot; a few times and let the observer watch you try. Tell them you have a hard time going with you watching and act weirded out if you can. The less you say the better and waste their time. ACT EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED. After 10 min I have never had a lab tech seriously watches after 4-5 false starts. <br /><br />3. Crotch the empty bottle and get the fuck out of dodge. <br /><br />Also before you do this practice at home to use as little motion as possible and try to keep the bottle under your nads as you squeeze it into the cup. <br /><br />I have beat many supervised tests for an employer using this method at a testing facility. If you have to do it for a Parole or Probation it may not work or be feasible at your home.
