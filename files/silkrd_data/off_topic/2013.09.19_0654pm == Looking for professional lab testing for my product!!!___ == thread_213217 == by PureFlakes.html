				You gotta hit up the cocaine avengers like the lsd avengers test LSD. You will have to pay them to do it, and even then people will still not trust it. Just sell it. People will prove if you really have the best.

				Check out my post here, I laid out a kind of guide: <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210392.msg1535254#msg1535254<br /><br />Imho it would be great if people actually lab tested and posted the printouts... even if it was only once in a great while.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think would go far in building and keeping customer trust.

				I honestly think people just do not do their research on the forums enough, and it is too hard to argue the information is accurate or no one was paid off to show certain results. I have had a scientist test my cocaine in the 90%, but, people will still post feedback that says it is not that high. (Because their nose definitely knows better than a PhD scientist)
