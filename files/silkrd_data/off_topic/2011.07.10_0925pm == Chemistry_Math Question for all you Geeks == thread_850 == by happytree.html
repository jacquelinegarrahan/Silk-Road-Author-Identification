				Let&#039;s say I have .66 Grams of a Product, that needs a 4 (Product) to 1(Water) Ratio for my &quot;mixture&quot;. How many milligrams of do I need please? I guessed .165 milligrams of water but I SUCK at math.

				0,66/4=0,165<br />So you are correct. But be careful, 1ml=1000mg=1g<br />so you need 0,165Ml water<br /><br />I think that you need opposite; 4(water):1(product).<br />With your ratio question is would 660mg will be dissolved in 0,165ML(165microliters)

				You&#039;re doing something horribly wrong if you are trying to make a solution and using the mass of water as a measurement. You should *always* be concerned about the volume of liquid and not its mass, and you should likewise prepare any solutions in as close to a standard environment as possible (1 atmosphere, 25 C).<br /><br />If you start doing things by mass, you will get what mseller said: 660 mg of solute in 165 mg of solvent. The only way this is really even conceivable is if you are dealing with an extremely dense and extremely soluble compound, but I&#039;m positive that this isn&#039;t the case. As was described above, 1 gram of water is equal to 1 mL at standard conditions, so 165 mg of water is 0.165 mL and thus 165 microliters.

				The ratio I needed was 4 to 1 (coke to b.s.). I was incorrect thinking that the 1 was water.&nbsp;
