				I have smoked DMT in the past but i didnt have an experience like the one shown in the movie. Although, i took my DMT sparingly since it gets you high pretty fast and i read online that you might have a bad trip if you smoke too much so not sure who to believe..

DMT deserves reverence my friend. Going in with expectations, especially based on that scene, will not help you. I don&#039;t know what kind of red, shitty, underwater realm he was in, but it&#039;s just not like that. Once you have everything you&#039;ve ever known obliterated by an incomprehensible reality the shock can put you off from trying it again for months or years (me five years ago). I researched it as well as I could and was already experienced with other psyches, but nothing really prepares you. <br /><br />Dose was probably around 50mg, but I know I didn&#039;t get it all. Dose matters, but the thing I&#039;ve learned with psychedelics is when it&#039;s your time to experience something it will just happen. If vaporizing then my advice is be ready to accept whatever happens and don&#039;t fight, just let go.<br /><br />

				First I want to say thank you RedDead for starting this topic and making me watch this movie.<br /><br />Second, THAT MOVIE BLEW MY MIND. Really, it changed the way I perceive life. Made my kinda afraid of DMT, but here in Brazil is 2 easy to get, in legal means, so I&#039;m trying next week. Will do a trip report later, if I got the balls to use.

				Anyone that thinks I&#039;m fucking with you guys hasn&#039;t done enough research. I&#039;ve watched the Spirit Molecule and I don&#039;t recall anyone talking about their insectoid encounters, but they are in the book along with other strange experiences. The movie presented the most normal or acceptable trips reports iirc. You guys seem unaware of the range of possibility and sheer power of this stuff. This isn&#039;t something you buy just to say you&#039;ve tried it.<br /><br />Clowns/elves/harlequins are another common theme and I&#039;ve seen people have positive and negative experiences with them.

				I&#039;m not trying to say it&#039;s all about insects, but you guys seem surprised that that can happen. Most DMT trips I&#039;ve witnessed lean towards the positive, but there are a significant number of times that a person was left unable to integrate the experience and the rapidly fading memory was a benefit to them. What I&#039;m trying to say is you don&#039;t have a choice of what you will experience, so better to know and be prepared for anything. Do a search for &quot;dmt-nexus insectoids&quot; on google and click &quot;more results from dmt-nexus&quot; and scan the results. Often enough mention for me.

				see i take that as a general rule with any psychs, you just gotta enjoy the ride as once youre on theres no getting off so its best to just lean back and roll with it, give yourself up to the experience, i do remember someone mentioning that many people also see gnomes of some sort rather regularly and often reoccurring too, but i suppose when youre visiting other worlds its only right youd see otherworldly beings.<br /><br />on the subject of the film, its ok but it feels like its rather drawn out in places, like it could have been a one and a half hour movie but he somehow felt the need to extend it to 2hrs.

				i encountered grey aliens on an LSD trip on time. scariest shit i&#039;ve ever experienced. its like they walked out of the walls from another dimension. i know i was hallucinating, but it just seemed like it was more than just a hallucination.&nbsp; maybe it was triggered because i was in a dorm room with a bunch of people i didn&#039;t know, but if i learned anything it was don&#039;t be in a dark room, and go outside if you cant get away from people.&nbsp; needless to say i&#039;ve never done it since.&nbsp; &nbsp;i was pretty young then, and i&#039;m a different person now than i was then.&nbsp; maybe the experience changed my life for the better by altering my life&#039;s path or the way i think.&nbsp; There was definitely some prophecies and revelations that i feel have come to fruition from that trip. If advanced beings really exist and wanted to kill or harm us, i&#039;m sure they would have done so by now.
