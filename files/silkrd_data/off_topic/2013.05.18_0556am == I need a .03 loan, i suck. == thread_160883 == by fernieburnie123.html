				Not going to try to guilt trip you or anything because seeing all of these incredibly cheesy sob stories around here for redonkulous loans kill me.<br /><br />I&#039;m not dying of cancer, and im not a med student 50 billion dollars in debt. <br />I just miscalculated earlier today, and need exactly 3 dollars to the penny.<br /><br />i know my karma is gonna get dragged through the mud for this but i figured that I&#039;d rather be embarrassed (for asking) than regretful (for not). <br />i can pay whomever back a week from today (with interest and eternal gratitude) friday the 25th. I cant wait to order then because the product won&#039;t come in time for the festival i&#039;ll be attending.<br /><br />my sr name is the same,<br />fernieburnie123<br /><br />one love and thanks for reading

				Isn&#039;t that a cunt? It&#039;s worse though when you don&#039;t have enough coin because the transaction didn&#039;t process properly enough and the market swung. Sadly I have no coins to my name to offer; I had a burst of luck in paying exactly what I added in.

				When this is the case....meaning you legit need what amounts to pennies ....on here to complete and order...it would be in&nbsp; your best interest to see what the price is on SR (meaning the 24hr weighted average) vs Mt.Gox right now...if you did so when you actually wrote the Op and when you just wrote that last message...you would see that it is higher on Mt.Gox...and that means that if you just wait..you can make your order with out needing a loan and without coming off as a lying scamming prick in the forums(not saying you are...just saying you would never have to write this post and sound like anyone that does).<br /><br />So just wait for a bit and the price will go up on SR and you will have enough to buy it yourself ;D
