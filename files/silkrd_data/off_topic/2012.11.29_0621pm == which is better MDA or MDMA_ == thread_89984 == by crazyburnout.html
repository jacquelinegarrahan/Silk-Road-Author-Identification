				I wrote about this a few days ago: <br /><br />&quot;A few nights ago, I dropped .250 grams of my MDA order from the ILF (very legit vendor, I highly recommend) after a two-month break from MDMA. Here are my takeaway thoughts:<br /><br />1) MDA is a much more psychedelic/less euphoric version of MDMA. I knew this was to be expected going in, but the visuals were much more &quot;trippy&quot; than I had imagined, producing some nice CEV&#039;s t:4:00-t:9:00 after dropping. The euphoric impulses also felt somewhat muted, lasting only t:1:00 - t:3:30 and did not lead to the personal introspective thoughts I&#039;ve come to expect from MDMA.<br /><br />2) The MDA experience is a two-parter; the first is like a normal roll and the second is somewhat similar to a mild LSD trip. Although the first &quot;euphoric&quot; stage only lasts a few hours, the second stage lasted 2x as long. Hence, MDA felt much longer lasting than MDMA, as I still had lingering visuals and huge pupils 20+ hours after dropping.<br /><br />3) The MDA hangover is absolutely terrible, much worse than MDMA&#039;s. I&#039;ve never felt that mentally broken before, it was as if I was experiencing temporary brain damage. I struggled to put simple sentences together, and it felt like someone was driving a pick axe into my skull. Just thinking about it is giving me migraines...<br />&nbsp;Now granted, .250mg is a heavy dose for me and I wish I had halved it, but I&#039;ve had pleasant comedowns on MDMA after using .400mg&#039;s in a night. This experience was in a league of its own.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />Would I do MDA again? Probably, although I&#039;d take it in lower doses/combined with MDMA next time and in a different setting. It seems ideal for use at a festival or psychedelic show, but definitely not in a solitary setting, as the therapeutic self-reflection felt toned down vs. the one experienced on MDMA. Just not worth the mental anguish I felt coming down.<br /><br />Overall, an interesting experience, even taking into consideration its negative aspects. I&#039;d recommend any seasoned molly veteran at least give it a try, although I caution anyone buying it as a replacement to MDMA, as the two are definitely not one in the same!<br /><br />Anyways, thanks for reading! If you have any personal insight to add, it would be very much appreciated.&quot; <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85344.0<br />

				based on what you said you will like MDA. It&#039;s a lot more intense than MDMA. Grab some ILF and give it a try, you&#039;ll enjoy it.

				Hit up the ILF, he won&#039;t do you wrong. Just a heads up start out at no more than 100mg, and don&#039;t exceed 175 in a night. Usually with MDA less is more as it&#039;s definitely a bit more potent than MDMA.

				though i wouldn&#039;t take either to get &quot;fucked up,&quot; i must say my personal preference is mdma. it&#039;s more euphoric and relaxing than mda, which is more psychedelic and a bit too stimulating for me. everyone&#039;s chemistry is different though. i imagine a combination of both would be really nice.

				MDMA is my regular treat, MDA is a bit more of a commitment as it lasts longer, can be quite psychedelic, and gives me a crushing headache towards the end. It&#039;s still lovely though, I just prefer to have an entire day free and start early with it. MDA in a forest or beach during the day is awesome!

				I also have to suggest ILF. For me it started as a more energized roll and later in the night after some more doses I would get short hallucinations. I couldnt stop staring at my cell phones home screen lol. I felt I had a lot more energy compared to MDMA also, and less empathy. I personally enjoy MDA in a party scene. I felt more confidence on MDA and I feel I trust people more on MDMA. I plan to mix MDA/MDMA soon. Once again tho check out ILF you wont be disappointed.
