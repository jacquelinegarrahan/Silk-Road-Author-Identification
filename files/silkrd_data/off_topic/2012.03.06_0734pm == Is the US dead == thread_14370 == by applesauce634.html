The only guy with any understanding of the situation is Ron Paul and he effectively has a 0% chance of winning. I would like to bet $1000 on Obama reelection but I don&#039;t think anyone will take that bet. When it&#039;s a choice between that douchey asshole Romney and Obama, of course Obama will win. Republicans seem to be choosing to sit this one out while making it look like they are trying to win.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly, they&#039;re employing the Democrat strategy from 2004 when they put that bumbling idiot Kerry in the national spotlight.

Primary numbers for Republicans are down something like 9-10% from midterm elections. Considering how their favorite talking point was &quot;taking the country back&quot; 9-10% is big for a very loyal voting base who do not seem at all impressed with what they have to choose from. They&#039;ve also been campaigning on bullshit topics- contraception has been the latest. The only chance either of them have to win however, is to pick Marco Rubio as a VP candidate, to suck the Hispanic voters ass who will be this years swing voters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;d agree though on the first part of your statement. The issue voters are what piss me the fuck off. Voters that will only go to the polls if the candidate is &quot;christian, has family values, talks about immigration, etc, etc, etc.&quot;- completely disregarding they have little to no agenda. What&#039;s worse if they have to &quot;pray on it&quot;- fucking man up and vote, it&#039;s as simple as that. <br /><br />I won&#039;t even get into Ronald The Ray-Gun.

				I understand the paranoia. I did 300 mics of LSD over the weekend, and at one point I thought reality had disappeared. I was just a consciousness talking to my own thoughts and experiences, and I actually believed for a good amount of time that reality was gone and this would be my life from now on. It was both terrifying and exhilarating. <br /><br />But to answer your question, China launched its nuclear weapons and everyone is dead. I&#039;m one of the lucky few.
