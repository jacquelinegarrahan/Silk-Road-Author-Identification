				What a complete bitch. She injured that guy seriously and pretty much nothing happened. Imagine if the sexes were reversed what would happen.<br /><br />This is what a misandric, man-hating society we live in.

				It will be fun watching her in prison yell &quot;get your hands off my breast&quot;, and probably in that case she would even really be the one molested but sadly it will not change much. No crowd to cheer for her either at the end.<br /><br />Maybe this will give her a little of perspective on things.<br /><br />The problem is not feminism, the problem is stupidity (as in the crowd cheering an applauding for an obvious imbecile act).

				i&#039;ve come across a few like her - and the sad part is, they tell the lie so many times, they actually come to believe it - they literally create their own reality (in their own mind)<br /><br />had a guy that had rented a garage from me, a low life house painter. The guy was nuts, hadn&#039;t paid his rent in 3 months, so i evicted him - but the courts are really protective of tenants, even there&#039;s no written lease. Found out he&#039;d used a fake name in renting from me - that he was wanted for stealing a spray painting rig from a paint supply store. Cops asked me to call them when / if i saw him. <br /><br />Well, i caught him at the garage, blocked his station wagon in with my car and called the cops (i had one of those cell phones the size of a military walkie talkie, weighed about 4 lbs) - cops came, took him away.<br /><br />few days later i get a call from a detective, to warn me - while interviewing the asswipe, he&#039;d stated to the detective that i&#039;d kidnapped him and had him held for months on end at a mental hospital in the ozark mountains, to the point that he&#039;d lost track of&nbsp; the days of the weeks, and even seasons of the year. cop was basically saying, this guy is a nutcase<br /><br />the hillarious part, after getting out of jail, he sued me for $150K, claiming i&#039;d caused him to be falsely arrested and deprived of &quot;matrimonial delights&quot;. Nevermind that i hadn&#039;t filed any charges against him and the outstanding arrest warrant was for theft from a paint store. In court,, he represented himself (thought i was watching one of those eccentric british comedies). he called himself to the witness stand, then would ask himself a question, and real quick would climb into the witness box, answer it, then jump down to ask himself another question.

Feminism made western women feel so fucking entitled that they think there&#039;s nothing wrong with making false accusations against men or assaulting men. Feminism is a hate movement that promotes misandry, the hatred of men.
