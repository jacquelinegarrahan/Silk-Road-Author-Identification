				Does anybody else crave food during an LSD trip? It&#039;s been a few years since I last tripped on LSD (will soon thx to Tess, though), and I honestly can&#039;t be certain if it was real or RC as I didn&#039;t test it. Every time, whether I eat before or not, I always crave food. The second trip was the only time I gave into the urge. I wanted nachos :o, so I drove to the (very, very close) grocery store and wandered aimlessly until I happened across beans, grated cheese, and chips. I couldn&#039;t really read words, so I just went on visual. I actually made it out of the store with those specific ingredients. I got home and made the most disgusting plate of nachos I&#039;ve ever seen. There were probably around 50-60 chips on a large plate, with half a family-size can of re-fried beans, and probably an inch of grated cheese. It took forever to microwave, but I digress. I started to eat it and got about a quarter of the way through and, of course, started to feel incredibly ill. Anyway, it turned into a real shit trip with me in the fetal position on my bed for the next 3 or 4 hours&nbsp; ::) Since then, I&#039;ve avoided food during these supposed LSD trips. Any thoughts? LOL

				Eat fresh fruit and drink only water.<br /><br />Anything else makes me sick.<br /><br />Plumbs and oranges taste amazing when tripping.<br /><br />Beer goes down surprisingly well - as long as you don&#039;t take enough to get drunk.<br /><br />Cannabis helps get rid of the nausea.

				I&#039;ve only ever been able to drink water while on lsd, the texture of anything I&#039;ve tried to eat has always been disgusting or &quot;too much&quot;. When on 25i though I can eat without problems(after that shitty taste in my mouth is gone)

				Food is SOOOO good on LSD.<br /><br />Once I grabbed a bunch of chopped up onions, red peppers and cheese left over from fajitas and mixed it all up with a jar of salsa and ate it with nachos.<br /><br />It was very good. The flavors are so amplified.

				I must say, burgers are disgusting, pizza wasnt too bad. Too much flavor in burgers imo, simply flavored foods are best. It seemed to just magnify the flavors so strongly flavored things can be overwhelming.

				Thanks for all the replies. I got a nice laugh at a few. You guys confirmed exactly what I was thinking. I like the fruit, veg and water idea. I will definitely have a tray of fruit in the fridge for my next trip. As I love fruit already, I can only imagine how it would taste tripping! Although, I&#039;m afraid honeydew might require a change of pants. God, that stuff is good.

				My old lady swears by Ramen noodles when she&#039;s on LSD. Only thing you can get her to eat. Anything else, and she can&#039;t even manage a salivary response. Me, I can eat anything I want. It takes a lot longer, and some flavors give me weird synesthesia if there is music in the room (tasting music, feeling food, cannot be described), but my appetite always goes back to normal after the come-up. DURING the come-up, however, projectile vomit city if I so much as drink a Gatorade. Beer, oddly, is okay.

				Dark chocolate, Skittles and peach candy are my favourites. Last time I popped a green Skittle at the peak and it changed it&#039;s taste at least 5 times, amazing!

				I agree on dark chocolate. actually whenever i eat dark chocolate on acid it makes me laugh. it&#039;s something about the texture of the chocolate that i find humorous if that makes any sense<br /><br />But candy in general doesn&#039;t taste good on acid

				I don&#039;t get &quot;hungry&quot; per se, rather, I want certain pieces of the food experience. For example-last trip I really wanted to eat something warm. Didn&#039;t care what. Thought about making chocolate chip cookies, but figured the oven wasn&#039;t an option at my level of functionality. Ended up grabbing a frozen pizza &amp; nuking it.<br /><br />Never before have I seen a pizza look so utterly unappetizing. It was as if somebody had cut out a circle of thick cardboard &amp; painted white on top of it. That thing went in the garbage quick.<br /><br />The only thing I&#039;ve ever been able to eat (if you can call it that) was an orange. I basically peeled it &amp; sucked all of the juices out of it like some kind of LSD-fueled vampire. It was a great experience though-tasted incredible.
