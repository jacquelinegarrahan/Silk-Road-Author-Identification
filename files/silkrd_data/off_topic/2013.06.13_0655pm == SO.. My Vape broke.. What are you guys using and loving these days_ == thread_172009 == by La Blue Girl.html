				My vape broke just like it says in the title. Been poking around on the clearnet and i swear that the people in the forums for these things are all working for one vape company or another and all just bashing each other.. <br /><br />I am thinking about getting two maybe three.. I want one for the house and maybe a portable one or two.. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking at the Pax, Solo and a few custom type portable ones.. <br /><br />What are you guys loving? Hating?

				If you want to go portable, I&#039;d recommend an eCig with hash oil. They&#039;re cheaper than a vape made for cannabis. You can get one for around $40 or so. And they&#039;re very stealthy. I use it in public all the time and no one has any idea. If they ask I just tell them its an eCig. If you&#039;re intereted, PM me for recommendations.<br /><br />However they don&#039;t last forever either. Its a bit of an investment, I&#039;m well stocked in spare atomizers and batteries (cheap Chinese pieces of shit, lol)<br /><br />Peace

				I had looked at a few that are the 510 threading like that.. the Egos and Agos and such.. <br /><br />Also eyeballed the Skyda8 and White Rhino Trifecta too.. (same thing one just has a brand name from what I can tell)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve really only used portable units that took herb before.. I would not know where to start with the Oils and waxes.. Seems some units are made for heavy and others only light.. <br /><br />for the house the Da Budda / silver surfer looks good... or maybe just a Solo for the house and camping type stuff..

				Anything from 7th floor, they have pen vapes VIP and SSV/Da Buddha are excellent. Don&#039;t go cheap on vapes you&#039;ll have them forever if you invest a good amount. 3 yr warranty from 7th floor.<br /><br />Don&#039;t go for any of the cheap ecig, they are rubbish.
