				Well, I also play NLHE, only 25/50ct. limits. Been doing this for couple years already. At this point I actually earn more from poker than from my day job. I blame poor economy of my country and my laziness (etc.) to do IRL career. <br />So yea, poker pays for my weed.&nbsp; ;D<br />

				I am a semi-pro poker player. I used to be a full on pro poker player. Since I can&#039;t play online in the states anymore its made it much more difficult.<br /><br />I was going to make a thread to see if anyone was interested in investing in a horse (the horse being me, lol) I have cashed in 2 WSOP events and many other events.<br /><br />I know that there are many sites that offer this type of service but I was wondering if we could start one&nbsp; here. The average investor gets between 50-90 percent of the winnings. But, there are a lot of factors that go into it. I usually sale stakes in myself.<br /><br />For example:<br />I will sell 10,000 shares at 2 dollars a share and the horse (me) usually will buy up most of the shares. (this is just an example. if any of you are interested, hit me up. I&nbsp; usually do a 3 or 4 month period. (with poker, there are a lot of swings. So, to withstand those swings, you have to have quite a bit of time) Also, there are many rules that are written like a contract. If anyone is interested, please feel free to hit me up....

				Where do you guys play? I&#039;ve been checking out sealswithclub.org since they do BTC and has better interface than the ones before it, and they have freerolls. Still not so many players but I&#039;m hoping they&#039;ll get more popular.

				I&#039;ve been a semi pro at the Super Turbos on FT.<br />Trying to achieve the same on PS right now. Haven&#039;t got to the level of FT yet, but a 25$ hourly isn&#039;t bad either for a university student.

				It sucks being in the USA when you are a poker player.. You guys that are outside the usa are so damned lucky to be able to play. Im sure when the usa players where banned, the games became much softer and easier to win.. <br /><br />I wonder if I could hook it up thru Tor, lol then I would have to find a canadian bank, address, etc. too big of pain.<br /><br />Thats what a Cananadian needs to do, set up bank accounts, address and ways to route our computers thru a server in Canada. That would be awesome.. Ill check out the sealswithclub.org and see what type of action is there.. Damn the USA for banning poker. Yea, and we live in a free country, HA!

				If you had decent results pre-BF you shouldn&#039;t have a hard time finding somebody to setup an account for you.&nbsp; Its not too tough to setup the vpn and have the other person handle all the cashouts.&nbsp; Sites like ipoker just don&#039;t care that americans are playing...you have to be a bit more careful on stars.&nbsp;
