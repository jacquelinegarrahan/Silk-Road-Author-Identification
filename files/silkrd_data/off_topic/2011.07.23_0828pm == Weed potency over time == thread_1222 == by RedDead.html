				I was wondering if bud looses its&#039; potency if you have it in storage for a long time. I was thinking about stocking up for a rainy day. Anyone have any experience with this?

				Or buy dark hash. Generally speaking the darker the hash, the heavier it has been pressed. Heavy pressed hash lasts for years. And the added bonus of buying from SR is that it will already be vac-sealed, so leave it as you receive it, in a safe, dark place. Preferably a cool place, but from personal experience, vac-sealed hash left at room temperature will last a long, long time.<br /><br />Buds, well yeah I suppose, but they will never last as long as hash.

				recently found weed in my car from a year ago.<br />(yes, stupid I know)<br />It gets hot where I am as well...<br /><br />There wasn&#039;t very much potency loss.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it&#039;ll still get me high after a year in that kinda heat, then it should last fucking decades vacsealed in a freezer.<br />just my experience

Im pretty sure the THC content of weed does deteriorate over time. The US government produces pot for research and they store it freeze dried&nbsp; so I guess temperature is a factor. I once misplaced a bag of weed for about five years and when I found it and tried to smoke some - it did not work at all. I don&#039;t think Id buy more than a years worth at a time , and keep it in a vacuum sealed bag in the freezer.

				No need for a freezer.<br />Just put in a glass locking jar, or mason jar.<br />Tuck in dark corner, and forget about it.<br />

				In tests it lose 13% potency when broke up and left out on a tray on a window sill over one year.&nbsp; I bet it lost 99% of its flavor though.

				in my opinion the best way to store weed for semi long run, up to a year, is to put it in ziplock bags, then store the ziplock bags in a small portable humidor for cigars, with a Boveda 69% humidity packet. those plastic humis are air tight, and fridge keeps it fresh and tasting good, plus you can smoke it right out of the box
