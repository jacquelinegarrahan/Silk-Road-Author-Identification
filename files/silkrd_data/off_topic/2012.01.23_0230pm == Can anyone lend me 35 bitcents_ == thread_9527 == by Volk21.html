				I&#039;m waiting for cash to go through to mtgox and am short of ordering something by about 35 cents, if anyone would be kind enough to lend me that much I&#039;d repay with 50 in 2-3 days. SR username is the same as on here.

				Sure, when I was in a similar position I got help so I&#039;ll be happy to help you. :) No need to pay me back, I&#039;ll send it to you within an hour, cause I&#039;m kind of busy at the moment. <br />EDIT: I sent you .1 bitcoins. That&#039;s 63 cents right now. Enjoy your drugs :)

				I appreciate it MB, but another person done hit me up with a loaner. Not for the 5.55, but for the .5 for one order. <br />Gonna post it later. We should start our own little circle of loans. The person who helped me out, has now done so twice. Not sure if they want to be named, but I really do appreciate it. I have RL friends that wouldn&#039;t budge off 3 bucks to save your life! <br />Also, I saw a post of yours about BMR, if you have time, I wouldn&#039;t mind a bit of info on it (free selling). Feel free to PM me.

I was actually just f&#039;n around when I posted that, I didn&#039;t expect anyone to help me out. <br /><br />@Moonbear: I don&#039;t know how a loan pool would work, but a 1-1 loan can&#039;t go too bad. If it&#039;s kept little. Person who loaned me the BTC has my respect, I ain&#039;t here trying to jip someone outta a couple bucks. And the help they provided will be repaid in kind, for sure. I even offered to have a portion of my purchase sent their way, but vendor didn&#039;t want to split it up.

				Hey guys, I&#039;m in a similar position. I&#039;m two bitcoins short and I could really use some help. I have 9 bucks on a paypal account that I will gladly send over (somehow, I guess it could be traced, you decide), and I will also send your two bitcoins back when I got it. I&#039;m really in a tough spot, so any help I can get would be gold :)<br /><br />Worth mentioning is that I&#039;m willing to send my money first as a safety for you, if you are a reputable member here :) thanks a lot!
