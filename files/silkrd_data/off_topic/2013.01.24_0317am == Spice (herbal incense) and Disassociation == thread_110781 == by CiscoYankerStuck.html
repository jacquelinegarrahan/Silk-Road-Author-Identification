				I&#039;ve noticed spice (the herbal incense kind, not DMT) doesn&#039;t get discussed here very often, but I&#039;m curious to know about others&#039; experiences.<br /><br /><br />I spent several months smoking spice daily, going from 1 bowl a day eventually to 5 bowls a day to compensate for tolerance.<br /><br />I noticed it had very potent disassociative effects on me, among other very bizarre effects. And when I started smoking multiple bowls a day the disassociation hung with me throughout the day even when I wasn&#039;t high. I have not done any classic disassociatives, so I don&#039;t know how it compares, but my experiences matched word-for-word with the definitions of disassociation, derealization, and depersonalization.<br /><br /><br />My question is, who else has experienced this? And how does it compare to other disassociatives?<br /><br />As amplifying information, I&#039;m referring to the much more recent types of spice being sold. The US federal government banned the original 5 chemicals used in spice back in 2011 and then the local government in the area I was in also banned many more chemicals detected in spice, so frankly, I really don&#039;t know what was actually in the spice that was having these disassociative efffects on me.

				lol...brosif....you can&#039;t be smoking spice every fucking day like that...i definitely smoked spice, in fact it was my first time smoking DMT...that was so amazing...especially because this was before i had tried REAL LSD....<br /><br />anyways...i moved on to NNDMT freebase...and well i was like u and wanted to pretty much smoke it every night when me and some roomies were just chilling....it was fun to tell stories of our trips and what not...<br /><br />anyways the point is about a month of fucking around with DMT i was going DEEPER and FURTHER than EVER before....Finally i went too far and i pretty much quit smoking DMT...it was so intense i thought i died started a new life lived there then died again and came back to this life....<br /><br /><br />well the morale of the story is, get some NNDMT....breakthrough to the outer reaches of hyperspace then come back and enjoy this life ahahah...im on to LSD now...as it lasts way longer and no were near as intense...<br /><br />NOT to mention DMT prices are FUCKED!!!! i would buy 10g at 550 back in the day with sr fees included....ever since MHRB ban here in USA we&#039;ve been fucked.

				Heh, I guess I should have been more descriptive in the OP. I was talking about the spice that gets sold in head shops and gas stations (that herbal incense type stuff), and agreed, you definitely can&#039;t be smoking that shit every fucking day like that.&nbsp; ;) It turned out that it was really addictive. When I realized I was addicted, that scared the fuck out of me (as I had never been addicted to anything) and I flushed everything I had down the lew and threw out my pipe. I was tweaking a little bit for a week or two and I haven&#039;t touched that shit since.<br /><br />I AM very interested in DMT, though, and I think I&#039;ll be trying it at some point in the relatively near future.<br /><br />Sorry about the confusion.

				Yeah, I&#039;m talking about the synthetic cannabinoids (certainly not MDPV though).

				So I finally did some ketamine. I didn&#039;t k-hole, but...<br /><br />It seemed to me that ketamine is much more physically disassociative while spice is much more mentally disassociative.

I&#039;ve had some severe episodes of dissociation that I am almost certain are due to using spice. The brand i was using was Johnny Clearwater but I have no idea what was in.

Sooner than later a 3.5 gram bag lasted a day and I was hitting the shit every 15 minutes. I&#039;ve never felt such a draw to keep &quot;redosing&quot; on anything.

I was doing completely senseless tasks, drank a large amount of alcohol in &quot;secret&quot;, and a lot of things that just didn&#039;t make sense. My recollection of this day comes mostly from my girlfriend&#039;s account, but if you want to talk some more about it feel free to pm me. This happened several times with episodes lasting maybe 4 to 8 hours.I haven&#039;t used any in just over 6 months, after using pretty heavily for 5 or 6 months, and none of those episodes have happened since. Very scary, I&#039;m glad someone brought this up. <br />&nbsp;<br />

I&#039;m glad to hear I&#039;m not the only one. Same here, I haven&#039;t touched it in about 6 months, but it is tempting when I&#039;m feeling down (to be disassociated from my RL problems, that is).
