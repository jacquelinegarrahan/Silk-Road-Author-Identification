				I have a problem with a very reputable RC vendor. I soon will conclude that he ripped me $1500. He doesn&#039;t communicate anymore with me about my order while he continues to sell little quantities to other customers (viewed on safeorscam.com). I don&#039;t have any idea what to do. I just thought about saying that on safeorscam.com to tell the truth to other people of the community.<br /><br />Could someone be so kind to invite me on safeorscam.com? I use it very often and would regularly to reply messages. I had and continue to have many contacts with RC vendors so I could be helpful for the interest of this website.

				You have nothing going for you, you have no posts, no reputation. No referral, no dice.<br />post the name of the RC vendor and maybe someone can pass a message through.

				I think yourbestfriend just might not use the SR forums that much. I don&#039;t see why he shouldn&#039;t get a referral. If I had any to give, I would. Sadly I&#039;m looking for an account too... I want to gripe about buy-jwh&#039;s shitty 4-FA.

				Thank you for your messages.<br /><br />I&#039;m really disappointed now and don&#039;t see any solution except of saying it on safeorscam.<br /><br />For information that&#039;s BCD from who I pre-ordered for 1500$. Please PM me if you can help or want more information to avoid this vendor which has 9.5 for 84 ratings on SoS.

This man really has a big problem with communication. I notified that very much times ago. But I always trusted it and was right because he never scammed me. In this actual case I&#039;m not really sure if he want to scam me or if he has other problems.<br /><br />He also has a big ego problem. He really thinks he&#039;s the best RC vendor and has the project to control all the scene that should according to him fall in the coming times because of the illegality of most vendors. He just doesn&#039;t know that he&#039;s the worst vendor in the range of the trusted ones. The only reason I order from him is his exclusive products.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if he will fall soon but if he scammed me I shouldn&#039;t be the only one so every people like me has to notify that and I think safeorscam is a good place to.

				Owch. I still need a referral! If anyone wants to give me one, that would be nice... I want to comment about the MXE, 4-FA, EP, and 6-APB I got from buy-jwh before they stopped shipping to the US.

				anyone who considers handing out SOS referrals to people on SR are fools.<br /><br />For one, SOS referrals are a privilege that comes with a certain amount of trust that you will only give one to someone you know very well, they are not to be traded or sold as the consequences of letting either LE or some fuckhead get one are huge.<br /><br />Anyone who considers either selling or trading referrals is a cunt and shouldnt be involved in the scene at all<br /><br />Also all referrals are traceable back to the referrer so if you give one to someone who turns out to be either LE or a dickhead your name will quickly spread around and you will be shunned.

				Hi all if anyone could help me out with a SOS referral code I&#039;d be most grateful, I&#039;ve asked my supplier but he and his friend don&#039;t have enough karma to supply me with one and I&#039;d really like to add some feedback for him which has really been done sufficiently since the end of last year and he definitely deserves it, comms are great, delivery times impeccable and he&#039;s a generally all round nice guy and as we all know every seller deserves gratitude and feedback if they&#039;ve done a good job, especially if it&#039;s been more than once.<br /><br />Would really appreciate the help if anyone here can do so.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />MM
