				Don&#039;t want to be a party pooper, but when the previous poster said &quot;it will become legendary&quot; he is quite correct, SR will become legendary, ie. a legend, ie.SHUT DOWN. The more publicity, the more the authorities will feel obliged to allocate more funding towards shutting it down or implementing more security protocols in the postal service. Why can&#039;t people just be happy that SR exists, use it and keep quiet about it. What&#039;s with this need to shout about it from the rooftops? I&#039;m sure the authorities would rather just ignore it if it kept quiet and small- they probably realise there is little they can do, they will have had their experts analyse SR for weaknesses and will be reluctant to throw money at it for little gain- UNLESS publicity forces them to act!<br />JUST ENJOY AND KEEP A SECRET, PLEASE!!!

As soon as guys within the criminal organizations started talking about it, it drew more attention from LE and the public and i ended up being bad news.

				This behavior totally helps me understand how all good things MUST come to an end<br /><br />or<br /><br />why a handful of people should not be buyers<br /><br />or<br /><br />why a handful of even more people should not be sellers.

				Yeah you are right, when i said it would be legendary i meant it would be funny as fuck i suppose. But of course you dont want people shouting about it everywhere, i reckon every time sr gets a thing like this a few thusand dollars or pounds gets put into investigating it all.<br /><br />being fair, it probably was some first time buyer who was high as fuck on god knows what, amazed that his first order actually arrived.

				OMFG i wish everyone would stop with the fight club references... SR is NOT a fucking frathouse for closet cases and their testosterone-fueled gang bangs. It&#039;s is a free marketplace where ALL are welcome. Everyone... even idiots who call radio stations and give shout outs and shizz.

At the end of the day, different people have different views on SR, how it should be run etc. After all, it is for everybody, that&#039;s the ethos
