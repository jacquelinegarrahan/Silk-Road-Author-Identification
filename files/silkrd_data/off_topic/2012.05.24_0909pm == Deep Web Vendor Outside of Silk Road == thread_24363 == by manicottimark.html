				I&#039;ve just recently started surfing the deep web and I came across this one vendor, Paradoxum. He&#039;s not part of the silk road so I&#039;m skeptical of buying anything from him, but his lsd is very reasonably priced so I wanted to see if anyone had purchased from him or could give me any advice on him. The link to his site is, http://mto5z3kx5ydxjrz3.onion/

				Uses Hushmail Forms apparently.<br /><br />No GPG key present. <br /><br />Nice looking site aesthetically though. <br /><br />I&#039;ll have to point my tech guy at it.<br /><br />My .onion consists of 4 things at present (bare essentials).<br /><br />1. Pictures of product<br />2. tormail address&nbsp; (NOT hushmail, hushmail is dangerous.. ask the Farmer&#039;s Market guys)<br />3. silk road vendor profile page<br />4. GPG pubkey.<br /><br />If I go on a vendors site I want to see at very least.. product pics with descriptions, a secure email, and their encryption public key. That&#039;s the bare minimum IMO.<br /><br />If they have vending profiles on public darkweb markets.. great!&nbsp; But they gotta have secure email and a crypto key.

				Without a PGP key I would be wary plus you are at the vendors mercy as you have no escrow option. If you can afford to take the hit perhaps check it out and report back.

				That site has been up for a while (I came across it about 6 months ago or so).&nbsp; &quot;#1 deep net dealer&quot;&nbsp; That&#039;s a load of crap.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#039;t have access to safe or scam but I bet he&#039;s on there.<br /><br />No escrow, no reviews, no protection, expensive.&nbsp; Expect to lose your money, in my opinion.<br />

				The Road, with it&#039;s strengths and it&#039;s weaknesses, is just the safest place to do this kind of business. The premiums we pay are worth it when we deal with professional, community vetted vendors. EVERYTHING a decent human being wants is here, dunno why anybody goes anywhere else.

				Personally i wouldn&#039;t trust that website.<br />I have sent them an email in the past for basic inquiries.&nbsp; If they haven&#039;t even got the courtesy to respond to an email then you should think otherwise.&nbsp;

				Wouldn&#039;t trust this site at all. I mean.. the LSD market has taken a kicking here but is it really worth risking your cash on a probable scam?
