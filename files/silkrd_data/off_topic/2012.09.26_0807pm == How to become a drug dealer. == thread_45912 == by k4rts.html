				You just moved to a different state to a town that doesn&#039;t have much to offer. A couple bars, a few restaurants, but no real night life. The closest major city is a 2 hour drive. You don&#039;t go to school here and you don&#039;t have a job. The only people you know are the few relatives that live here. However, there is a small private college within walking distance.<br /><br />How do you start dealing drugs in a place like this?

				Start by rolling up J&#039;s and just take them over by the school and offering to smoke it with people.&nbsp; Then whilst you&#039;re getting blazed casually mention that you&#039;ve got more where that came from.&nbsp; This can also give you a chance to feel them out and see if they might be interested in &quot;harder&quot; drugs.

Be straight forward about quality,price, weight, etc. <br /><br />When it comes to customers, you&#039;ve made friends right? At least simple acquaintances at school, bar, etc, well, just do that, but once you know them a bit, just drop the, &#039;oh hey, do you do whatever drug it is your selling&#039; or &#039;hey man, you wouldn&#039;t happen to know anyone who would need any whatever it is your selling&#039; <br /><br />If you can&#039;t be real and comfortable with strangers and new friends, this isn&#039;t for you.<br /><br />Also be logical. Even if your desperate for sales or to pick up, slow down, realize what&#039;s going on. If something feels sketchy, get away from it. <br /><br />Try not to sell out of your house. If you don&#039;t have many other options, only sell to people you really trust, people that also come to hang out when you don&#039;t have drugs, y&#039;know, FRIENDS<br /><br />God speed. Don&#039;t let them coppers fuck ya in the ass buddy

				You don&#039;t want to be a drug dealer. Drug dealers are shady, slimy bastards that get a mediocre product at a high price, leaving the only way for them to gain any sort of profit is from cutting the already impure substance into an even more substancially shitty product.<br /><br />You want to be an illicit entrepreneur.<br /><br />He just pulled that corny term right out of his ass, you might say. Well, you&#039;re right, I did. However, the difference between the two is that an illicit entrepreneur (that I already shortened into a clever abbreviation, IE). An IE gets his product at a very cheap and reasonable price, as well as an exceptional quality, in comparison to the garbage that you will find on your local street corner. The IE believes in a very fundamental aspect of modern economics; take care of the customer, and the customer will take care of you...we&#039;re talking profit here by the way, if you want to consider a career in Pimpcology (AKA an exotic dancer supervisor)&nbsp; then you may take that as a sexual reference. Basically, you sell a pure product, you charge the accepted standard street price of your area, and you even add insult to injury to the competition by adding slightly more product per sale than the other firms. An IE is either very well connected and knows the right people around the local harbor, a ruthless individual with access to the local trap house (AKA the blow spot) with an unusual sense of empathy for his customers, or an average run of the mill guy who found an online hidden service to fulfill all of his drug-related needs.<br /><br />As you can imagine, I&#039;m obviously the ruthless individual with connections to the youngins at the trap spot. All bullshit aside, locate a few people (honestly five or so) that you can sense dabble around in recreational drug use. Nonchalantly, but convincingly, confer the fact that you are connected. Sell them a small sample of your product, and within a month you will blow the fuck up. If the initial contact with the first clients is problematic, or if you can&#039;t spot out an individual that seems to enjoy recreational drug use, then you should not try to sling dope by any means.<br /><br />Last advise, don&#039;t screw anyone over. ANYONE. The opportunity cost of not getting the extra cash from being a slimy bastard will end up being surpassed by the income brought on by your honest means of business (irony). That way clientele will grow, everyone&#039;s happy, and you&#039;ll eventually find a reliable bulk buyer if you wish to take the next step. As always; disposable phone, double back on your car route whenever you&#039;re driving, and never tell anyone anything about specifics or logistics of your enterprise.&nbsp; A vague description is one thing (even that&#039;s not preferable), but never anything concrete that could be used against you. Also, the area is also a big factor, nice suburban rich areas bring the benefit of not getting run up on and ice-picked in the stomach for your product. Finally, blend in...don&#039;t dress like a character out of the Police Profiling Handbook 101.<br /><br /><br />Not that any of this is from experience. I watched Scarface last night, and I didn&#039;t write this belated comment, Adderall did. Please, no applause...just throw money.<br />&nbsp;

				since i&#039;m spun and in the typing / rambling mood<br />i&#039;ll address your vague question with a answer that could actually help you .. this info will be useful to start your carreer as a drug dealer.<br />first you need to go to the projects. there you must look for a specific type of character. this man you&#039;re looking for is african american, he has a doo rag on, with a fitted baseball cap over the doorag. he will be wearing an oversized white tshirt and very baggy jeans. he is usually around others that look and act like him. you will have to sit fairly close to this crowd of black men and observe their actions. if you see them having some quick exchanges that seem like drug transactions, then you know you are closer to your man. look for the alpha of this crowd of black doorag wearing men, the one that clearly dominates his peers. this man&#039;s body language indicates he is very tough and possibly violent. <br />but i will explain how to gain his trust so you do not feel intimidated.<br />now here is the tricky part. you must approach this man offering him a solid handshake, maybe offer him a cigarette .. must be newport, any other cigarette will be refused by this particular kind of person. once he has smoked your cigarette, tell him that you have a few thousand dollars to buy some uncut coke or crack. you must be clear and straightforward demanding that he sells you his uncut cocaine. your aggressive bold tone and confident demeanor is key to gaining this black man&#039;s respect. you must demand his connect and his drugs. now his reaction will seem strange but you must understand this is their way of testing you. first they&#039;ll ask if you&#039;re LE, which you should reply &quot;HELL NO.&quot;&#039;<br /><br />Now within the deep circles of dealers we have a kind of lingo or code words that prove we are trustworthy and not LE. it may seem bizarre but trust me this is standard protocol.<br />you must tell him .. &quot;i&#039;m a cuckold looking for BBC&quot;, which means i&#039;m a young-gun and looking for &quot;business barebone cocaine&quot; (which means uncut cocaine for business purposes)&nbsp; he will pretend to act baffled but continue by saying the insider secret code &quot;i&#039;m an upcoming cuckold into black shaft, and i need black shaft BBC given to me raw and hard&quot;<br />&quot;black&quot; means cocaine that has been not been cut, with the purity levels at black (the highest when testing coke purity) &quot;shaft&quot; means at wholesale prices. &quot;hard&quot; means as a brick, not as powder. true flake uncut coke comes as a brick. &quot;raw&quot; obviously means in it&#039;s raw form, before being diluted with other shit. we call that &quot;hard black shaft&quot; at this point he will stare you up and down and introduce you to his friends. asking for hard black shaft raw is lingo that only true insiders know about, so these words are like a secret handshake giving you an opportunity to discuss doing business together.<br />it is vital you keep introducing yourself as &quot;the cuckold that wants black shaft raw and hard&quot; .. <br /><br />they understand that lingo and will most immediately likely invite you up into one of the project residences. make sure you come equipped with a significant amount of cash because these people require upfront payment for a first time buyer. your cash must be handed to them out of good faith to emphasize your seriousness. don&#039;t be alarmed if they threaten you with bodily harm. that is their way of testing your character. you must pass their test by showing your lack of fear .. you must match their threats and fear mongering by showing your readiness to fight back, carry a small knife and point or wave it directly at their faces to prove your character is strong and you&#039;re not a coward. they are not actually looking to fight. they will just want to test you, so pull out the knife and POINT IT directly at them.<br />that shows you are truly a cuckold, not cowardly, and there to do serious business. remember to emphasize that you want the black shaft given to you hard and raw and you&#039;re willing to take it (smuggle it) up your ass.<br /><br />that will pass their test so you can be rewarded with their approval. their approval means they will now do business with you.<br />you will have to give them all your cash immediately. they will tell you to wait at a certain location, usually in the projects hallways. you&#039;ll have to wait for a at least 1 hour. after giving them the secret code words and proving yourself by showing no fear then comes the business transaction.<br /><br />please note these black men expect you to have at least 4000usd to take you seriously. this is your wholesale cost which is reasonable. within 1 hour they will return with the very large amount of drugs. the 4k you invested will later be cut and quadrupled in size .. so your profits from this relatively small investment will yield you at least 50kusd profits.<br /><br />so now after receiving your drugs, now you want to increase the quantity without degrading the quality. that means you need cutting agents. the most commonly used cutting agent is kosher sea salt. ordinary salt doesn&#039;t work. it has to be kosher sea salt. the second best cutting agent is baby powder but that overwhelms the product&#039;s smell wirh a baby powder smell that cokeheads usually hate.<br /><br />if you want to convert the coke to crack, simply pour all the coke into a pyrex bowl of an acidic juice like orange juice. cook that for 10 minutes and then you&#039;ll be left with an orange liquid. to make that into rock form you will have to pour this liquid into a bowl of SAWDUST and SEA SAND and place in the freezer for approximately 8 to 12 hours. the sawdust / sand combo will dry the liquid into a powdery freebase. but to turn that dried powder into rock you will need to purchase baking powder. pour the baking powder into the sawdust, seasand powder and place into a frying pan. add about 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and ice add 3 spoons of bleach. close this container and place in freezer for 4-8 hours.<br />then you&#039;ll have solid rock cocaine ready to slang and deal.<br />now you want to sell it.<br />the best safest way to sell it is to advertise on craigslist or the local newspaper. you will make a post there. from experience the best way to advertise is to be direct and detailed about your drugs. your ad should look something like this:<br />&quot;selling bulk amounts of cocaine for very reasonable prices, prefer to meet face to face for the transaction, my cocaine is the best in &lt;insert your city here&gt; and you won&#039;t be dissapointed. for more details please call me&quot; put in your cell number because people prefer to call their dealers directly. <br />you will be flooded with people wanting to buy your product<br /><br />another commonly used method to advertise is very bizarre but most dealers swear by this. you&#039;ll want to find midgets that are small enough to fit into those doggy doors of houses. you&#039;ll want them to sneak into people&#039;s houses crawling through those doggy doors. once they are inside the house instruct them to go into the fridge and take out all the beverages like bottled soda, orange juice, bottled water, etc..<br />then instruct them to dump amounts of coke or meth into these bottles, close them up, shake them very well and return these bottles back into the fridges. the people at these houses will be drinking these beverages and getting high without knowing anything about it.<br />once your army of midgets have infiltrated 50-100 houses spiking all their bottled drinks with your drugs you have hundreds of addicts that have no idea what got them so high. they all will feel great from these spiked drinks .. so after approx 2 weeks most dealers have the midgets slide back into those houses with little posters reading &quot;if you want to feel that great feeling again call this number&quot; .. these people call your phone begging to find out how they can get that wonderful high .. there you have hundreds of new customers. this method can be tricky if some of them decide to press charges against the midget&#039;s trespassing .. but 96/100 will become your customers for life.<br /><br />then there are the more obvious conventional ways of dealing .. <br />that is finding a street corner and standing there for hours .. whispering to passersbys &quot;coke&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;, &quot;meth&quot;, etc<br />you have to look for those who look like they MIGHT do drugs .. judging them by their appearances. <br />obviously your drugs are hidden in your anus so if suddenly police stops you, you won&#039;t be holding anything<br />if police happens to ask you to strip naked, just use the oldest trick in the book<br />offer the officer 30k in cash to let you go. works all the time with these corrupt pigs.<br />&nbsp;<br />another way to advertise your services is to simply find people who look like junkies. anyone skinny with thinning hair and bad complexion is usually a cokehead. the simple hard sale. you approach them and say &quot;i have cocaine for sale, are you interested or not?&quot;&nbsp; being able to recognize a drug user is vital to being in this game. anyone who is skinny, has thinning hair or a severely receeding hairline, has acne or bad complexion, and especially if they do not blink every 5-6 seconds. study their blinking habits. those who blink less are cokeheads .. those who blink a lot are sober. also look out for those who sneeze. a sneezer is usually a sign of the cocaine tickling their sinuses. anyone who talks a lot, lets say you overhear someone talking for 20 minutes non stop about a certain subject. that is surely a cokehead. anyone who sniffles is a cokehead. mostly everyone who wants with a limp is a cokehead. so these are easy tell tale signs. once you notice any or several of these behaviors from people .. introduce yourself as your neighborhood&#039;s friendly drug dealer and offer them their next fix.<br /><br />another less conventional way is to leave little tiny baggies of drugs outside nightclubs with your phone number written on the bag. people will find these little bags and call you for more<br /><br />get your family hooked on your drugs. cousins, siblings, even parents.. let them sample some good coke, and they&#039;ll be your customers for life - plus they wont snitch you out since you&#039;re blood<br /><br />what you need to do is be smart about your transactions. the best way to deal is out in public .. anywhere indoors usually have cctv so pick a public place and meet your customers there. outdoors in the broad day light in a public place is where you want to conduct your exchanges<br /><br />to be a successful dealer you must master the art of hiding your drugs in your rectum. <br />this is VERY IMPORTANT because cops don&#039;t search your rectum. <br />ALL and i mean ALL successful dealers have conditioned their anuses to store massive amounts of drugs and contraband.<br />this is valuable information i&#039;m giving you here so follow these steps and you&#039;ll be rich<br />you have to train your anus hole to accomodate max 5lbs of drugs. this takes practice. the inner world of drug dealers have mastered the ass hiding method exactly like this<br />each day you stretch your hole outwards for 20 minute intervals . you must use vaseline or lube<br />day 1 : using your fingers stretch your hole outwards to create a 2 inch opening<br />day 2: insert a&nbsp; tennis ball in your hole and let that maintain the stretch for at least 20 minutes<br />day 3 to day 7 : contiue stretching your hole with the tennis ball but increase your stretching times by 10 minutes until you your anus muscles can successfuly host a tennis ball for 5 hours straight<br />day 8: you will need some tools like a large plier to stretch your hole wide enough to insert a 1lb bag of sugar<br />day 9 and onwards : everyday going forward you MUST fit various SOFT objects like larger fruits<br />by day 20 you should be able to insert books, picture frames, glass cups, and plates into your hole<br />this will condition your hole to accept all kinds of drugs AND drug paraphernalia. there will be times that you will need to quickly stuff bongs, large 2lb+ bags of coke, and many similar objects whether soft or with sharp corners. by now your inner anus walls should be strong and conditioned enough to handle this expert level of drug and contraband storage which is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of this carreer choice. i&#039;d say the most important<br /><br />all this might sound frightening and way beyond what you expected but if you&#039;re serious about making serious money in this business this is an insiders guide that you must master otherwise you will not survive in this business.&nbsp; so follow these guidelines and you&#039;ll succeed.

(which means uncut cocaine for business purposes)&nbsp; he will pretend to act baffled but continue by saying the insider secret code &quot;i&#039;m an upcoming cuckold into black shaft, and i need black shaft BBC given to me raw and hard&quot;<br />&quot;black&quot; means cocaine that has been not been cut, with the purity levels at black (the highest when testing coke purity) &quot;shaft&quot; means at wholesale prices. &quot;hard&quot; means as a brick, not as powder. true flake uncut coke comes as a brick. &quot;raw&quot; obviously means in it&#039;s raw form, before being diluted with other shit. we call that &quot;hard black shaft&quot; at this point he will stare you up and down and introduce you to his friends. asking for hard black shaft raw is lingo that only true insiders know about, so these words are like a secret handshake giving you an opportunity to discuss doing business together.<br />it is vital you keep introducing yourself as &quot;the cuckold that wants black shaft raw and hard&quot; .. <br /><br />they understand that lingo and will most immediately likely invite you up into one of the project residences. make sure you come equipped with a significant amount of cash because these people require upfront payment for a first time buyer. your cash must be handed to them out of good faith to emphasize your seriousness. don&#039;t be alarmed if they threaten you with bodily harm. that is their way of testing your character. you must pass their test by showing your lack of fear .. you must match their threats and fear mongering by showing your readiness to fight back, carry a small knife and point or wave it directly at their faces to prove your character is strong and you&#039;re not a coward. they are not actually looking to fight. they will just want to test you, so pull out the knife and POINT IT directly at them.<br />that shows you are truly a cuckold, not cowardly, and there to do serious business. remember to emphasize that you want the black shaft given to you hard and raw and you&#039;re willing to take it (smuggle it) up your ass.<br /><br />that will pass their test so you can be rewarded with their approval. their approval means they will now do business with you.<br />you will have to give them all your cash immediately. they will tell you to wait at a certain location, usually in the projects hallways. you&#039;ll have to wait for a at least 1 hour. after giving them the secret code words and proving yourself by showing no fear then comes the business transaction.<br /><br />please note these black men expect you to have at least 4000usd to take you seriously. this is your wholesale cost which is reasonable. within 1 hour they will return with the very large amount of drugs. the 4k you invested will later be cut and quadrupled in size .. so your profits from this relatively small investment will yield you at least 50kusd profits.<br /><br />so now after receiving your drugs, now you want to increase the quantity without degrading the quality. that means you need cutting agents. the most commonly used cutting agent is kosher sea salt. ordinary salt doesn&#039;t work. it has to be kosher sea salt. the second best cutting agent is baby powder but that overwhelms the product&#039;s smell wirh a baby powder smell that cokeheads usually hate.<br /><br />if you want to convert the coke to crack, simply pour all the coke into a pyrex bowl of an acidic juice like orange juice. cook that for 10 minutes and then you&#039;ll be left with an orange liquid. to make that into rock form you will have to pour this liquid into a bowl of SAWDUST and SEA SAND and place in the freezer for approximately 8 to 12 hours. the sawdust / sand combo will dry the liquid into a powdery freebase. but to turn that dried powder into rock you will need to purchase baking powder. pour the baking powder into the sawdust, seasand powder and place into a frying pan. add about 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and ice add 3 spoons of bleach. close this container and place in freezer for 4-8 hours.<br />then you&#039;ll have solid rock cocaine ready to slang and deal.<br />now you want to sell it.<br />the best safest way to sell it is to advertise on craigslist or the local newspaper. you will make a post there. from experience the best way to advertise is to be direct and detailed about your drugs. your ad should look something like this:<br />&quot;selling bulk amounts of cocaine for very reasonable prices, prefer to meet face to face for the transaction, my cocaine is the best in &lt;insert your city here&gt; and you won&#039;t be dissapointed. for more details please call me&quot; put in your cell number because people prefer to call their dealers directly. <br />you will be flooded with people wanting to buy your product<br /><br />another commonly used method to advertise is very bizarre but most dealers swear by this. you&#039;ll want to find midgets that are small enough to fit into those doggy doors of houses. you&#039;ll want them to sneak into people&#039;s houses crawling through those doggy doors. once they are inside the house instruct them to go into the fridge and take out all the beverages like bottled soda, orange juice, bottled water, etc..<br />then instruct them to dump amounts of coke or meth into these bottles, close them up, shake them very well and return these bottles back into the fridges. the people at these houses will be drinking these beverages and getting high without knowing anything about it.<br />once your army of midgets have infiltrated 50-100 houses spiking all their bottled drinks with your drugs you have hundreds of addicts that have no idea what got them so high. they all will feel great from these spiked drinks .. so after approx 2 weeks most dealers have the midgets slide back into those houses with little posters reading &quot;if you want to feel that great feeling again call this number&quot; .. these people call your phone begging to find out how they can get that wonderful high .. there you have hundreds of new customers. this method can be tricky if some of them decide to press charges against the midget&#039;s trespassing .. but 96/100 will become your customers for life.<br /><br />then there are the more obvious conventional ways of dealing .. <br />that is finding a street corner and standing there for hours .. whispering to passersbys &quot;coke&quot;, &quot;hash&quot;, &quot;meth&quot;, etc<br />you have to look for those who look like they MIGHT do drugs .. judging them by their appearances. <br />obviously your drugs are hidden in your anus so if suddenly police stops you, you won&#039;t be holding anything<br />if police happens to ask you to strip naked, just use the oldest trick in the book<br />offer the officer 30k in cash to let you go. works all the time with these corrupt pigs.<br />&nbsp;<br />another way to advertise your services is to simply find people who look like junkies. anyone skinny with thinning hair and bad complexion is usually a cokehead. the simple hard sale. you approach them and say &quot;i have cocaine for sale, are you interested or not?&quot;&nbsp; being able to recognize a drug user is vital to being in this game. anyone who is skinny, has thinning hair or a severely receeding hairline, has acne or bad complexion, and especially if they do not blink every 5-6 seconds. study their blinking habits. those who blink less are cokeheads .. those who blink a lot are sober. also look out for those who sneeze. a sneezer is usually a sign of the cocaine tickling their sinuses. anyone who talks a lot, lets say you overhear someone talking for 20 minutes non stop about a certain subject. that is surely a cokehead. anyone who sniffles is a cokehead. mostly everyone who wants with a limp is a cokehead. so these are easy tell tale signs. once you notice any or several of these behaviors from people .. introduce yourself as your neighborhood&#039;s friendly drug dealer and offer them their next fix.<br /><br />another less conventional way is to leave little tiny baggies of drugs outside nightclubs with your phone number written on the bag. people will find these little bags and call you for more<br /><br />get your family hooked on your drugs. cousins, siblings, even parents.. let them sample some good coke, and they&#039;ll be your customers for life - plus they wont snitch you out since you&#039;re blood<br /><br />what you need to do is be smart about your transactions. the best way to deal is out in public .. anywhere indoors usually have cctv so pick a public place and meet your customers there. outdoors in the broad day light in a public place is where you want to conduct your exchanges<br /><br />to be a successful dealer you must master the art of hiding your drugs in your rectum. <br />this is VERY IMPORTANT because cops don&#039;t search your rectum. <br />ALL and i mean ALL successful dealers have conditioned their anuses to store massive amounts of drugs and contraband.<br />this is valuable information i&#039;m giving you here so follow these steps and you&#039;ll be rich<br />you have to train your anus hole to accomodate max 5lbs of drugs. this takes practice. the inner world of drug dealers have mastered the ass hiding method exactly like this<br />each day you stretch your hole outwards for 20 minute intervals . you must use vaseline or lube<br />day 1 : using your fingers stretch your hole outwards to create a 2 inch opening<br />day 2: insert a&nbsp; tennis ball in your hole and let that maintain the stretch for at least 20 minutes<br />day 3 to day 7 : contiue stretching your hole with the tennis ball but increase your stretching times by 10 minutes until you your anus muscles can successfuly host a tennis ball for 5 hours straight<br />day 8: you will need some tools like a large plier to stretch your hole wide enough to insert a 1lb bag of sugar<br />day 9 and onwards : everyday going forward you MUST fit various SOFT objects like larger fruits<br />by day 20 you should be able to insert books, picture frames, glass cups, and plates into your hole<br />this will condition your hole to accept all kinds of drugs AND drug paraphernalia. there will be times that you will need to quickly stuff bongs, large 2lb+ bags of coke, and many similar objects whether soft or with sharp corners. by now your inner anus walls should be strong and conditioned enough to handle this expert level of drug and contraband storage which is one of the MOST IMPORTANT parts of this carreer choice. i&#039;d say the most important<br /><br />all this might sound frightening and way beyond what you expected but if you&#039;re serious about making serious money in this business this is an insiders guide that you must master otherwise you will not survive in this business.&nbsp; so follow these guidelines and you&#039;ll succeed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gotta be the funniest thing I read on here all week. +1
