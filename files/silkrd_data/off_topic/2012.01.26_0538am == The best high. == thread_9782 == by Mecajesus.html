				I&#039;m just curious to what and when gave you the best high you&#039;ve ever had?<br /><br />Share the experiences!<br /><br />For me, it was my senior year of high school when my friend stole a bunch of Darvocetes from his grandma and brought them to school, took two during gym by 7th hour it was the greatest high i&#039;ve ever felt. This was my first experience ever with downers i don&#039;t know if darvocets are an opiate or a benzo but who knows.<br /><br />Other than that, i&#039;d say it has to be the first time i messed with some H. <br />Haven&#039;t tried Meth yet, and i don&#039;t think i had enough Cocaine to really feel an euphoria effect.

				I&#039;m a sucker for a great pill. The white hearts that i had a few years ago would have to be the top of the list for me.<br /><br />Special mentions to some &quot;novelty&quot; pills that have floated around too, not really for quality, just for the fun factor... I like drug manufacturers with a sense of humor. One pressing was in the shape of little love hearts, pink in color. I remember at the time I don&#039;t think I&#039;d seen a bean that was harder to spilt or crush. Then without a doubt the &quot;funnest&quot; bean I&#039;ve had where things we called &quot;ka-bluey&#039;s&quot;, you may not get the reference depending on where you grew up but Ka-bluey&#039;s were a candy we had when I was a kid that would make your whole mouth turn blue when you ate it. These pills where the same, I assume they had a weird die/food coloring in them, if you touched them with slightly moist fingers it would stain them. It was almost impossible to ingest these things without getting a little trace of blue on your hands and lips... super funny to be walking around the club seeing all the fellow munters with blue stains all over there hands and face. Dead give away :)

				Not the first time doing MDMA, but probably the 3rd or 4th.&nbsp; Took around 700mg over the course of a warm, summer night, it was beautiful, but not something I&#039;d ever do again.<br /><br />Also, taking lots of oxycodone, and then making comfort food and watching TV curled up on the couch.<br /><br />Setting does make all the difference.

				The best high doesn&#039;t come from any specific drug... if you know why you do drugs at all, you can get there by taking any, or all of them... <br /><br />I&#039;m not going to wax poetic or start talking religion, but there is something to what I say. Ask yourself what your looking for when you get high. Plenty of young people are trying a plethora of new and amazing things and all in search of that...? I dunno, but something tells me they wont&#039;s stop until they find it or go crazy trying.<br /><br />Pioneers in crazy times.<br /><br />Anyways, I&#039;d say I get the best high from fucking. Sober, or otherwise.

				i&#039;ve had so many wonderful experiences... it would take me a page to list them all (each is unique in it&#039;s own way)<br />as far as knock out, drag out...crazy intense euphoria..&nbsp; i would say two decent mdma pills followed by a hit of nitrous at the exact moment of peak.&nbsp; it was really lucky timing.&nbsp; the short lived dissassociative awesome just sent me into the hardest roll i&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; it&#039;s hard to time things like that.<br />in a close second would be rolling out of a K hole.&nbsp; dropped the pills, and then 100 mg of K.&nbsp; the K was great, the guy cooked it up fresh for us (he was a wonderful host i really miss him).&nbsp; the pills kicked in right as i was deep in the hole.&nbsp; normally K is very positive and euphoric (and spiritual) for me, but i remember the normal gray swirly tones instantly became bright and blue and colorful.&nbsp; color exploded everywhere.&nbsp; when i came out of the hole i remember i just crawled over to a friend and latched onto her.&nbsp; i think i glued myself to her for like 30 minutes.&nbsp; this was like my 12th or 13th mdma experience, but it felt like my first all over again.<br /><br />*destiny*

				MDMA, every time (except when laced shit hit the markets) but thanks to SR I have a clean supply now.<br /><br />The 1st-5th time were unbelievably incredible, and literally saved my life.&nbsp; Got me out of a horrible marriage I didn&#039;t see was trainwrecked.&nbsp; Fixed my PTSD and pulled me out of a suicidal nosedive.&nbsp; A friend I convinced to roll with me swore off coke after a 12 year addiction, hasn&#039;t touched it in 18 months and doesn&#039;t even roll now.&nbsp; Sober... o.O&nbsp; Not everybody likes sober, but it beats the fuck outta where she was back then.<br /><br />MDMA let my brain remember what happy -really was- and I realized just how unhappy I had been, now I have everything I could want in life, I am motivated and pursuing another degree, I met the most amazing person I&#039;ve ever been with, and life is fucking great.&nbsp; For a few rolls to take me from an AR15 in my mouth to this?&nbsp; Indescribable.&nbsp; Saved my life.&nbsp; But then I was using it in a therapeutic setting, with the intention of learning and healing from it, not going out and being a clubwhore or anything.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure the effect is different when used as just another way to get high.

				I would say the best high I&#039;ve ever had was doing MDMA and LSD at the same time. I was the happiest 6 year old ever! It was like Christmas morning. After it started to kick in, I did a good line of some H to kick it all off. We decided to walk through tunnels at night time on the oncoming traffic side. (There was a walkway.) The sound echoed so much it sounded like a jet engine. It was a rush seeing the headlights comming right for you with the sound of thunder. Nothing tops that moment. Ever.<br /><br />-Jimbob-

I&#039;ve wanted to try it for awhile but always end up buying lsd or other psychedelics.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you respect the substance and use it in moderation, the comedown is almost non-existent.<br /><br />If you use it multiple times a week for months on end -- you will literally want to kill yourself. Extreme depression, lethargy, anxiety, loss of sex drive, etc... Seems like you&#039;ll never feel better.<br /><br />If you respect the substance and only use it infrequently, you will feel just fine. (I recommend at least 30 days between rolls)<br /><br />If you take too much, you may feel a little down or hazy for a couple of days, but it isn&#039;t bad at all.<br /><br />It&#039;s definitely something I believe every human should experience at least once. :)

				My best was 3 years ago in Canada NYE, went to this abandoned building for a rave (I guess my first true underground one)&nbsp; we took some beans before hand smoked some Lemon Haze and then found moonrocks when we got there- it was freezing outside but it felt so good just running out into the snow w/ practically no clothes coming back in making out with my girl raging and being in the very odd building we were in.&nbsp; It was the happiest moment of my life, i even had my 600$ slr stolen that night and i couldnt even complain. :o ;D

				My best high was the 4th time I took ex. It was prom night in high school and guess what.. I was the motherfuckin prom queen!! How awesome! As soon as they put the crown on my head I did my little smiles and let everyone take their pictures, and then got the hell outta there as soon as I could. My friends and I rented a cabin for the night and took our ex around 10pm. Double stack Pikachu.. haha like the little cartoon. It was amazing... i never wanted it to end... I was out of my mind happy! I slept a couple hours that night and woke the next morning with an afterglow that lasted all damn day long. It was about 10 years ago but if i close my eyes and concentrate really hard I can feel it again, just for the tiniest moment. Beautiful!

				First time i Took MDMA, was the best day i ever lived, i still get goosebumps thinking about it...<br /><br />Before i tried it, i smoked Weed daily for 5 years, since i was 15... <br /><br />I had never thought about cutting down, never thought about the outcomes which had occurred since i did this (i am 20 now and i have lost everything that i loved... because i didn&#039;t care about anything anymore).<br /><br />Now i only smoke once a week the most... not that i hate weed, but you just don&#039;t realize it when weed fucks you up.
