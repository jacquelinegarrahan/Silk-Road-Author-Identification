Its a really lucrative business. 10 grams of pure LSD is about 10,000 hits.

Everyone seems to somewhat have an idea that handling ergot is NOT safe. You are the one who is uninformed and needs to do some research. Here are some things to read about: The event of&nbsp; &#039;St. Anthony`s fire&#039; and the records of ergot poisoning documentation. Its also well known for leading to Gangrene also, as well as seizures, suicidal tendencies and miscarriages . Gangrene is the disease where your flesh rots and in most cases have to amputate the infected portion (legs/hands/thighs/abdomen)

I think knowledge in power and going hand in hand with experience. The books/studies are helpful and indicate that its Not safe, that is all. St. Anthony`s fire, the Russian famine, the English waves of ergotism/etc. Its really obvious no one will drink a culture, it can be airborne and be inhaled accidentally as well as get inside your body. In history people didn`t eat nuggets of ergot, the particles/alkloids left on their resources after removing the ergot was the problem. Either way my point was that its clear that Ergot is not safe to handle under normal conditions. The way you stated was lax, and it concerned me because its a serious matter, no matter what precautions taken. Little exposure is enough to foil the work and health of the Chemist.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30530.msg343305#msg343305">Quote from: BanWork on July 13, 2012, 05:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30530.msg342665#msg342665">Quote from: Imaginarytailus13 on July 13, 2012, 10:29 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=30530.msg341912#msg341912">Quote from: BanWork on July 13, 2012, 01:40 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have the contact details of a Mr A.Hofmann who may be able to assist you<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I hope that was a joke because Mr. Hofmann passed away in 08 at the age of 102.

				This is a subject that always humors me, Why do people figure they can make a substance such as LSD with no experience?. There is a reason most of the LSD on SR comes from over-seas (assuming you live in the US of course).

Thankfully they were kind enough to answer my questions and curiosity. We should assume this person had the same question too.
