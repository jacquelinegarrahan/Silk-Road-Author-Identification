				It&#039;s as simple as the title sounds... and to be honest, it&#039;s not even that hard. I just don&#039;t feel like doing it. I have 4 other classes that I like better this one so if anyone wants to do my work, which will probably take a few hours per week, I will definitely pay someone to do it for me for the rest of the semester. This class is 100% online... I&#039;m serious about this and would be willing to pay someone in BTC on a weekly basis for quality work. I will offer a very good wage in BTC per hour that it takes you to do the work. I will provide all necessary details privately... just message me if you would like to know more.<br /><br />The main piece of work that must be done is a 14 page research paper related to sociology. I need a rough draft within 2 weeks. This should be easy for anyone that knows about this topic.

				Lol, sociology. <br /><br />This is exactly what the world needs right now, more people with a sociology degree, who didn&#039;t even attend their own classes or made their homework ::) <br />I&#039;m for real.

				I agree with you... except it&#039;s not a sociology degree, it&#039;s a sociology class (which is why I could care less and would rather pay someone to do the work for me than actually do it myself).
