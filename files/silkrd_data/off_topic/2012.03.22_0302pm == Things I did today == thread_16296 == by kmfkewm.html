				The use of do with drugs is just an artifact of propaganda most likely. Doing drugs sounds scary and evil, using them or even smoking them sounds much less ominous. Drug users (note: not drug doers) should not use the language created by prohibitionists imo. <br /><br />I still do (USE) cocaine is fine. I used to use cocaine sounds more correct to me than I used to do cocaine. What did you used to do with it ??!

				i think you can only say &#039;do&#039; for certain things though:<br /><br />i&#039;ve never said &#039;i do cannabis&#039; because it sounds weird, but &#039;i do coke&#039;, &#039;i do heroin&#039; and &#039;i do MDMA&#039; sounds like it fits properly. perhaps that might be because coke, heroin and MDMA are more &#039;sinister&#039; drugs than bud?<br /><br />man this is getting too deep for my fragile little mind....

				Thank you so much for this post! if someone told me how the karma system worked i would +karma the fuck out of you. I have always found the question, &quot;do you do drugs?&quot; hard to answer. I wish we could abandon the concept of being in a constant state of drug use though. &quot; do you use drugs?&quot; is a bit vague.
