				I don&#039;t believe they last. Women are programmed to seek an attractive mate for babies and a stable mate to raise them and never should these two meet. Men are programmed to nail as many women as they can.<br /><br />And people as a whole are filled with illogical emotions that get in the way of their accepting the biological truth. It&#039;s the emotions that cause the problems.

				i agree that i dont think they&#039;re meant to last, from either sex&#039; perspective.<br /><br />but saying that, i&#039;d still go to a swingers party or an orgy, just cos im a filthy fucker after a smoke and a few lines<br /><br />its just i&#039;d rather go single. all the more fun for me and none of the guilt or the thought of knowing that some other dudes have DP&#039;d your missus the next time your going down on her.

				<br />Yeah, my wife and I went through a swinging stage (we were in our late 20s). It was good fun in the main. I&#039;d say 80% of the experiences were positive. We&#039;re both very secure in the relationship so were never jealous. It made me very fucking horny to watch her being fucked by other men and / or women (she&#039;s bisexual). The best experience I ever had was with us, another couple and one single female (FFFMM). The women were all bisexual so me and the other guy just sat back and watched them all go for it. It took a great effort to prevent myself from blowing my load early!! Also for my 30th birthday, my wife bought me 2 escorts for the night which came a close second as far as experiences go. We eventually gave up for no other reason that it was just an experiment anyway and we had no intention of staying on &#039;the scene&#039;. It was great fun while it lasted and I&#039;d recommend it to anyone as long as you are both very secure.

				Fond memories for sure. Gotta both be equally into it though. I met so many couples where it was clear that one of the partners was doin it for the other. One time we fucked with this couple and after we&#039;d finished the woman starts crying. It was a real downer.

				I don&#039;t care if my girl hooks up with other girls. She might love her female friends, but would never fall &quot;In Love&quot; with a girl so I&#039;m not at all threatened. Just this weekend she had a 5-way at school for the first time hahaha

				It&#039;s a fairly safe guess that most guys want an engaging wife to fuck, love, make children with and have completely to themselves. Those guys probably don&#039;t mind the odd drug fuelled occasion where the wife goes down on another hottie. The introduction of another guy is probably not such a hot fantasy. Similarly the odd blowjob on a business trip doesn&#039;t hurt and probably won&#039;t upset the apple cart.<br /><br />That would be the majority of 20-50yo guys in most corners of the world.<br /><br />Or at least it&#039;s just my wish and I&#039;m projecting :)<br />

				Reading this, not sure if i&#039;m the only crazy one or the only sane one...<br /><br />but I am WAY too jealous for that. If I saw another man having sex with my girlfriend or wife, I&#039;d pull my dick out of whomever&#039;s vagina it was in and beat the crap out of the other man. Would I love to have sex with someone else while in a committed relationship? Sure, who wouldn&#039;t. I couldn&#039;t handle it the other way around though, and since I&#039;m not a hippocrit, it&#039;s not for me. <br /><br />

The thing is, I know I&#039;m the only man for her (and likewise, I&#039;m 100% hers) so it becomes easy to hook up with another couple for a night without feeling weird emotions. It&#039;s the tinge of jealousy that makes it so horny. Likewise, she gets horny seeing me with another woman. One of the horniest images I have relates to one night (actually my 30th birthday) when she paid for a couple of very hot escorts for me. At one point, I suggested anal sex and one of the escorts said she was up for it as long as I wore an xtra safe condom. The escort gave the condom to my wife who proceeded to put it on my dick before lubing me up and guiding me into this woman&#039;s arse. I&#039;ve no idea why that was so horny to me but it was. I swear, if I&#039;ve thought about that fleeting moment once, I&#039;ve thought about it 1000 times. Remembering what a dirty bitch she was makes me love her more.<br />&nbsp;

				If I had to force the image of another man fucking my wife into my mind then:<br /><br />- I would want the guy to dissappear straight after and never be seen again<br />- Ideally he doesn&#039;t speak English<br />- I&#039;d be in on another girl at the same time<br />- A serious amount of cocaine would need to be made available<br /><br />Still.. it wouldn&#039;t be my first choice.<br />
