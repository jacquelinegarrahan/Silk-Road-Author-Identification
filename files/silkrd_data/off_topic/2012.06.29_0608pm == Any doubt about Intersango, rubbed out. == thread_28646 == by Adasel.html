				Hey all.<br />Just incase any of you are thinking about using a website to trade in BTC, i can personally confirm that Intersango.com are the bollocks, mutts nuts, or any other expression you can think of.<br />You may not take my word for it, but as a newbie i was really surprised in their service and reliability.<br />Therefore, not wanting to put anyone here out of business but for a good word in newbies who are a bit paranoid, use these guys.

				Agree, I switched to intersango because Mtgox took days to credit my account. Intersango take a couple of hours. Cant ask for more than that!

				Seconded.<br />I was very surprised at their speed.&nbsp; These guys are for real and want to make it in the big time.<br />If i recall, i tried a couple of times to set up an Mtgox account.&nbsp; However both times they failed to send me some password via email, or announce the activation of my account.<br />It could have been bad luck,&nbsp; but surprises like this are not what you need when doing business! 8)

				Hey there vlad, how goes it?<br />Do not think i was doing this behind your back bro, because i seriously wasnt.<br />I am currently in contact with another fellow deep web user.&nbsp; Basically we had a bit of business going on and he wanted BTC pretty quickly and suggested i use intersango.&nbsp; As i understand it, he is a regular user and as yet has had no problems.<br />Although i do completely agree with you, every company has their high and low times!!<br />Really need to keep an eye on those rates!!!

The simple answer is that doing so creates a paper trail that you have bought Bitcoins - this may not be sufficient grounds in itself to search your home but if, for example, you receive a package containing contraband and try to claim you didn&#039;t know it contained anything illegal, proof that you had bought Bitcoins, a highly popular digital currency for drug traffickers(!) could harm your defence!<br /><br />In addition it could cause the authorities to take an interest in you particularly if you&#039;re repeatedly moving large amounts. I work in a bank and as far as I know we don&#039;t have a specific system in place for monitoring Bitcoin purchases just yet but certainly repeated transfers of the kind necessary to buy drugs on SR could raise some red flags.<br /><br />I admit the risk is low that you&#039;ll be caught in this way but it is very real -it&#039;s for this reason I offer my service as your identity is protected when you send cash in the mail (even I don&#039;t know who you really are) and I have a series of special bank accounts for purchasing BTC via Intersango on your behalf - when the shit hits the fan, I can guarantee those of you who have obtained their Bitcoins in this way will be safer.<br /><br />I am not just saying this to get more people to use my service - honestly! Look in your Craigslist or on SR for other vendors rather than use me if you prefer but please, please stay safe and use cash only to buy your Bitcoins whatever you do.<br /><br />If you absolutely must use an exchange I would suggest using a VPN to set up a new account with MtGox then making a cash deposit to their Barclays account. As soon as you receive the coins I would send them straight to the mixer Bitcoinfog and withdraw them over several days to your SR wallet - this is the next safest method to using a service like mine. I&#039;ll admit it&#039;s not as fast or as safe but it&#039;s important people make informed decisions. :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hey there Vlad.<br />I know your not just trying to get business mate and what you have said is true.&nbsp; The basic facts are that Intersango have helped to put Bitcoins on the world map.&nbsp; Therefore now it is basic legal tender.<br />There will always be people who do not trust banks however, and that is where your service will soar!<br />After all, with all the shit going on in the uk right now involving banks, i do not blame people for not trusting them.<br />It all boils down to the individual!<br />

Whether they can link them to a specific transaction is rather academic, you can simply do without that kind of exposure!<br /><br />My service has been ticking over for around three months now for people who can do without the banks and Big Brother looking over their shoulder (see link to my review thread below) but I&#039;d really would rather people went to one of my competitors than used Intersango themselves - I don&#039;t deny you can often obtain Bitcoins fast when they&#039;re not experiencing a technical meltdown (which seems to happen regularly!) but SR users really need to think about ways to protect their anonymity.<br /><br />Sending cash in the mail clears up the problem altogether, would strongly advise people to think about it. The only reason I can use Intersango safely is because the bank accounts I use cannot be traced back to me - but it&#039;s pretty tricky to do this if you don&#039;t work in Finance! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi vlad.&nbsp; No worries mate, you are certainly a man worth knowing when it comes to protecting your anonymity.<br />To be honest, the only reason i was faltering on using your service is because i do not have a &quot;safe&quot; address where i can have goods delivered to.&nbsp; Once i get this problem sorted mate and i look to buy anything a bit more illicit, then i will knock on your door.<br />The other reason i used intersango is because what i was buying was hardly illegal although my partner only deals in BTC, so it was a catch 22 situation for me.<br />Please do not think i dont trust you with my address, but like we are saying in this thread, once your information is out there, anyone can have a peek.<br />Its also very cool that you work in finance bro.&nbsp; Took me a lot of research and working out to do before i even considered using BTC.&nbsp; Maths never was my strong point!

				Yer Intersango can be fast and a good service. But, remember that they have publicly stated they would help in any investigation of illegal use of bitcoins by people using their site. I think they said this when specifically asked about Silk Road. It out there on the web, just look it up.

				Thanks for the understanding vlad, fortunately i also have to use the calculator, although i use the old fashioned ones as i find using the desktop one a bit tedious and frustrating, not sure why though.<br />As for Intersango stating that they would participate in any investigation, this was probably an unwise move on there part.<br />Considering most investigations look into particular amounts of money being put in or withdrawn, then linking that amount up with purchases made on sites such as SR, this can be a bit of a red herring.<br />As long as you are careful about the amounts you handle and keep everything anonymous, as BTC primarily is used as, to coin the term &quot;ghost money&quot;, it shouldnt be a problem.<br />Although as you guys have stated about, if i do purchase on SR then sure i wouldnt mind using a service like vlad.<br />For now though, i am just accumulating BTC as and when i can.
