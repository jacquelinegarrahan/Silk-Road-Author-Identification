				I just received some bud from SR vendor and I was really hoping after reading strain reviews online that this bud was gonna be great.&nbsp; While I havent had a chance to sample it yet, I did have a chance to take a look at it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why will bud develop a tannish/brown color?&nbsp; The whole bud is not brown but maybe some of the buds are as much as 60-75% brown.&nbsp; They still smell pretty good and I did have a chance to look at them with a 30x loupe and all I saw was a whole lot of trichome stalks, but I have a hard time differentiating between trichomes and spider mite webs/mold.&nbsp; <br /><br />Could it be the result of a long cure?&nbsp; Or a long water flush before harvest?&nbsp; Or Nute-Burn from overfeeding?&nbsp; If all of the bud was a nice green color, this bud would have some great bag appeal.<br /><br />Can anyone knowledgeable in growing/curing weed help me out?

				probably been very long cured (fermented) or water cured. but there is a slight chance that it&#039;s moldy.<br /><br />hard to tell without looking at it. if you know how to remove exif data, you can take a pic of it and upload it. then you might get better answers.<br /><br />
