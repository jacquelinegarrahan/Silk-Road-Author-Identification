				Currently it takes me 2 days or more to get btc to sr. A day or longer to deposit to mtgox or intersango and then exchange and send to sr. This is all through bank transfer ofc, but does anyone have any faster ways of gaining them? <br /><br />I see drcashandcarry, who would deposit btc in ur sr wallet if u transferred money to his account has vanished from sr with no-one else offering a similar system with gbp. I cant buy ukash as theres no stores anywhere near me, so has anyone any ideas?<br /><br />I need a faster way so i can get orders paid for and shipped before the wknd as i get paid thursdays

				I buy a MoneyPak card at a local corner store using cash and exchange the card # with a reputable MP -&gt; BC exchanger on here. I have used BTC Buddy and the transaction went smoothly.&nbsp; The other name with a great rep for this is Sugar Mama.&nbsp; If they are near their computer when you place the order and have the BC the entire transaction could take less than an hour.&nbsp; Ask them first if they have BC available.

				If your BTC exchange has a direct deposit feature, you can go right into the bank they have the account with, with lovely, untraceable CASH, and deposit it right into their account.&nbsp; Usually takes a couple of hours.<br />My exchange/bank doesn&#039;t even require me to verify my identity, as nobody complains about folks depositing amounts INTO their accounts.&nbsp; :P
