				I have a really good deal going on with an SR vendor right now. Basically I&#039;ll soon be able to buy 100g of top-notch MDMA for just $2,725 with fees and everything. That&#039;s about $27 a gram, which is an insane price. Me and a very good friend of mine are going to start dealing locally. I&#039;m the supply/money, he&#039;s the actual dealer. I give him the product, he gives me back the money I paid for it, and we split the rest 50/50. Obviously a very good deal for me. But we&#039;re both relatively new to this, so I&#039;m hoping to get some general tips from people that have been doing it for a while. Right now, I got him a trackphone so that&#039;s secure. And of course we&#039;ll be dealing with cash only. Maybe some smaller bank deposits over time, but nothing too crazy. The money we make will be supplemental for leisure and stuff like that, it won&#039;t be our living. Still, safety is my number one concern. Any tips?

				My only tip is to cut your friend out of the equation. Do it all by yourself; that way, only you can be accountable if something goers wrong. <br /><br />If your friend got pinched, would he keep his mouth shut to save your ass??? I&#039;ve seen a lot of dealer partnerships go sour over silly things. A one man ship is easier to keep afloat.<br />Of course, this is just my opinion<br /><br />Another thing i&#039;d advise, is never have anyone call to your house. The less people that know where you live, the better.<br /><br />Best of luck with the venture ;)

				Hello divinechemicals,<br /><br />I understand the potential to make a very nice profit by purchasing MDMA on SR in bulk and reselling locally.<br />However, if you are asking this you are already off to a bad start.<br /><br />You need to already have a good, small client base that will buy a large portion of the MDMA. You may be buying the MDMA for $27 a gram and are doing the math to find what your profit can be when you raise it to a great profit margin, yet this only includes you making 100 sales of a Gram of MDMA. What is safer is to already have a small base of (3-6) people to sell your 100g to for them to sell. Just starting off you do not want/need to have to find 100 different people to sell to if you have no previous customer base. This is very risky. If you have to go looking for business, you&#039;re asking to get busted.<br /><br />As far as the generals of dealing -<br /><br />1. Get the money first, no fronting.<br />2. If it feels wrong: just don&#039;t do it. Greed isn&#039;t worth jail/injury.<br />3. Do not drive with the product in your car/have it known where it is at any time.<br />4. Do not use a bank checking/saving account. Get a safety deposit box and keep it in there.<br />5. Switch your burner phone regularly and meet at new places of your choosing.<br /><br />There are more. Just use common sense and don&#039;t end up in jail!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				I probably should have mentioned that my buddy does have a pretty steady client base ready to go. He has people that will regular be buying 3.5 or 7g at a time, that&#039;s part of the business plan. He&#039;s going to parties, meeting people, giving a fake name and all that. We&#039;re definitely trying to find a nice exclusive customer base that themselves will sell it. I mean once we really get moving, ideally he&#039;ll be selling an ounce for $1200, and that will be our cap. We won&#039;t sell more than that at a time. I will definitely never front. I once made the dumb mistake of fronting someone a gram. Never saw that money. I mean luckily it was just a gram, so no big loss obviously. Learned my lesson in the smallest way possible. We are definitely getting a safety deposit box, and we will change the phone regularly. And yeah, my buddy is pretty good at feeling out bad things... I mean the good news is he&#039;s taking all the local risk. To address you directly Psychedelicmind, we wouldn&#039;t rat each other out. I just know it. Especially because we both know what cops will do to make you confess and turn someone in. If they say they can help you if you give a name, they don&#039;t mean it. If one of us goes down, that&#039;s the only one going down. I trust this guy with my life. The reason I like the partnership is that it divides the risk. I take customs risk, he takes local risk. I don&#039;t have the burden of both. I&#039;m the bank, he&#039;s the salesman.

				It sounds like ye are fairly well set up. I wish you the best with it dude. <br /><br />I edited my post above as well, just to say to never let people know where you live. Always go to their place to drop stuff off.<br /><br />Lots of people going in and out of your house for a few minutes at a time is a dead give away!<br /><br />Peace

				I&#039;d link to the vendor but SR is down, but I will when it&#039;s back. A Canadian vendor. I mean you should probably start with his oz, you don&#039;t want to jump that high right away. His oz is like $950 with BTC fees and everything, so still a really good price. Quality is perfect.

				You do realize that Dutchaanbod is selling 100 grams for about $1600 right? Granted, he ships out of Germany and his reshipment policy is a bit dodgy, but that&#039;s still a fucking steal of a deal. I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s worth paying +40% for luckylucianno&#039;s stuff.

				Germany is a high-risk country. I would never consider shipping such a high amount from a high-risk country like that. I mean the DEA tends to ignore shipments found at customs, but you can bet they&#039;d come knocking for that much product. I&#039;ll gladly pay more for peace of mind, especially when I&#039;m still making ridiculously good money. If you start getting too greedy and taking unnecessary risks, you&#039;re asking to be caught. To each his own though.

				Teach yourself how to be cool under pressure. People tend to lose their heads, and if you&#039;re able to keep yours, it&#039;ll help you stay alive and/or stay out of jail.<br /><br />Take the first money you make and put it in the &#039;Lawer Up&#039; fund. This isn&#039;t re-up money, and this isn&#039;t rent money. This is only for when you get pinched. Make sure that you have a name and phone number of a lawyer who specializes in defending drug dealers. A good lawyer will save your ass, so long as you have money to pay him/her.<br /><br />Don&#039;t talk. To anyone. About anything regarding your operation. Ever. This includes, but is not limited to: friends, fuck-buddies, customers, wannabes, running buddies, or your mother. Dealing is exciting, and you&#039;ll want to tell people. Don&#039;t.<br /><br />Don&#039;t talk to the police. Ever. End of story.<br /><br />Good luck.
