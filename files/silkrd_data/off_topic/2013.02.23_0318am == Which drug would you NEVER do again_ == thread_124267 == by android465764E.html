				personally I love almost everydrug depending on the setting. I personally have never had a bad experience on any drug at all, but I will never mess with 2c-p again after my senior prom night.<br /><br />I did a ton of research on 2-cp and thought it would be the shit. When it was still easily able to be bought online I bought a gram for 70$ dollars. Then I bought a 70 dollar scale to weigh milligrams, and 100 capsules. My buddies and I managed to cap about 109 2c-p capsules and sold 5 to some trippy ass kicks we knew. (By kids I mean 19 year old high school dropouts)<br /><br />Like 6 hours later at 2 am i got a phone call and these guys were asking me to come outside my house like there was a party going on. I went outside and got in their truck and they were having the time of their lives blasting music, dancing, and telling me about the crazy adventures they been going on. I was excited to know how good my new drug was, I was about to make a fortune.<br /><br />That weekend five of my best friend each did one and we thought it was one of the best drugs we had ever done. We LOVED it, the drug is magical we talked, laughed, loved and laid around for hours talking about crazy stuff. SO everyone in my area found out about this stuff and were crawling out of the wood works for it. I traded 3 for eighths of weed, ozs of codeine, acid, molly, and money. Anyway my senior prom came around and my 5 best friends and I went it was 2 guys and 3 girls we all went together as druggie friends haha.<br />We took one before and had a blast, then on the limo ride home my friend Hillary took another half and everything was cool. We partied through the night with tons of glow stick, globes, and the glove lights. I&#039;m not entirely sure if Hillary took another after that, but at about 530 am we were all sitting on the driveway and suddenly she starts telling us how much she hates us. We thought she was kidding and just kept messing with her. Then she started freaking out about ants on her and ran into the house. She threw the huge commercial container of animal crackers around her house.<br />She eventually ran into the backyard yelling and we were like &quot;fuck lets get her inside this is a rich neighborhood someone will call the cops&quot;.<br />I grabbed her and sat her between my legs holding her and she just started throwing up all over me and flailing around. She pulled the blinds of the wind and was yelling. At this point he mind was gone. She would say only 4 words in this scary almost exorcism kind of voice. &quot;WATER WATER I NEED WATER&quot; &quot;CLOCK TIME PHONE WATER&quot; &quot;AIR AIR I NEED AIR&quot; we gave her a cup of water and she couldn&#039;t even hold it. We tried to give her Xanax to calm her down but she just threw it up.<br />Next thing you know we carried her to the bathtub and just held her as tightly as possible with the cold water running until she stopped tripping. It was like 5 hours. Eventually she was just like &quot;omg can you leave so I can change&quot;<br />You cant imagine how scary this was especially because everyone involved was also tripping. Some say we should have called the ambulance, but I have no regrets shes alive and well, still one of my best friends.<br /><br />Another guy I know, I sold it to him and warned him to take only one but who knows how many he took.<br />One day his friends called me and said &quot;yo man willie was yelling and punching shit talking about aliens so his mom called the police. When the police got there he tackled a cop and the other one tazed him&quot; I saw willie a couple weeks later and all I could say was sorry.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck with 2c-p unless you are mature enough to only take the 10to13 milligrams

				Bought Amphetamine, not my intentions to use it myself, as a regular hash/pot smoker for 6 years without touching any other thing than alcohol some times a year, I actually tried it out because some fell on the table, and I were up for 3 days hehe, very potent from AmsterDope vendor.<br /><br />I know Speed isn&#039;t the worst you can take, but for me who never take pills or barely touch alcohol and hate chemicals, it is :)<br /><br />Still alcohol is N1 enemy, have had problems with it for some time then shaked it off now I am 100% sober.

				I tried some 4aco-dmt and that was probably the worst (and wierdest) trip I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; The come up was pretty nice, but then it got way intense and I got some crazy pain on the back of my head.&nbsp; Right around when the pain started, I was talking all kinds of gibberish and couldn&#039;t not comprehend anything going on.&nbsp; <br />I had a similar effect on some very potent shrooms, but it was a lot more enjoyable with more &#039;good vibes&#039;

				Angeldust and anything that came out after. All the &quot;RC&quot;&#039;s - There&#039;s a reason they&#039;re called research chemicals. There will never be a practical use for them. I think the one I tried that brought me to this conclusion was mepherdone.<br /><br />Mepherdone felt like all the bad side effects of shitty mescaline that went around my high school (late 70&#039;s early 80&#039;s)<br /><br />Any drug that&#039;s come out since then I don&#039;t trust. All the MDxx&#039;s and 2c-b whatever the fuck.<br /><br />You want t trip? Take some good old LSD.<br /><br />Guess I&#039;m just an old fashioned guy.

				Like many, fuck alcohol. I don&#039;t like slurring words, feeling lazy/clumsy, and then getting a raging headache or even being sick depending on what I drink. However part of the problem is genetics and the consumption of certain types of liquor and how the body processes them. I actually spoke with my doctor and he said it isn&#039;t uncommon for liquor to cause uric acid flare ups (what causes gout) and then have it re-crystallize around your joints. After two or three shots of vodka, I can forget moving the next day because of how swollen my knees are, and a couple shots more of anything else and its the same story.

				Weed. I smoked that shit every day for 9 years and it fucked me up good and proper. Towards the end serious paranoia, memory loss, anxeity, depression etc not to mention the state of my lungs. Maybe it wasnt just weed and some of it was all the other things I hammered over the years but id defo say that was number 1. For anybody who says its not addictive your kidding yourself. Ive now gone over 2 an a half years and even to this day I can still feel the impact its had on me. When you smoke it yourself you always try to make out its not that bad and everybody does it etc. Its only once you have quit you can see how dirty it is and I still see some of my friends that smoke it that are so fucking boring. Seperating themselfs from the outside world and all they want is there bit of smoke and their xbox or whatever lol very sad. It was my girlfriend that helped me stop. I got with her and she didnt do any drugs and I knew I wanted to stop but couldnt. I stopped hangin around with everybody I knew and just spent time with her. Thats the only way I could get away from it and even if we split up now, I would never start smoking it again. EVER!

Since I tried DMT I&#039;ve been unable to enjoy LSD, Shrooms, 2C-B or any other trippy drug, because it just reminds me of the DMT and gives me really bad anxiety until I eat a bunch or Benzo&#039;s or take GBL and pass out. DMT literally ruined my ability to enjoy any kind of psychedelic :(

When friends of mine would start to freak out I would tll them no calm down this is what you are supposed to feel, this is what we all fell, this is the fun enjoy it. Once you open yourself to the experience you will enjoy it much better. You were fighting the DMT by trying to hard to go against what it did to you. <br />If you would be one day wlling, try DMT again but this time let it take you, and when you come back just smile.

				25c NBOMe. Took one too many tabs after misjudging my current tolerance. Had nasty tremors and couldn&#039;t form a single sentence for the next 5 hours until I passed out. Luckily I was able to call a good friend in time to come watch over me. Worst night ever. I&#039;m sure it would have been enjoyable had I taken only one tab, or maybe even half of one.

				Did PCP once many years ago.&nbsp; Scariest fucking thing I have ever done.&nbsp; On other psychedelics, I seemed to have some grasp of reality.

				25c-nbome RUINED ME.<br /><br />I knew the experience sucked but it wasn&#039;t until a little later that I realized that it had ruined me for any future drug use. I took way too much of it and was writhing in my insanity with massive disphoria for hours. Now every time I come up on anything other than marijuana I get massive anxiety. I&#039;m usually fine once I&#039;m fully under the effects but the come up of every drug sucks now. Even coming up on MDMA freaks me out now.<br /><br />fuck nbomes, the only chemicals of that nature that people should do are 2c-e and 2c-b.<br /><br />Other than that there&#039;s xanax. Happened to come across a gram of powdered alprazolam (xanax) and decided to eyeball a few mg. I snorted what I thought was only a little but I guess it was a hell of a lot because I remember days later looking at my phone thinking everything was normal only to notice it was days later. People told me of all the things I&#039;d done over the days and said I was acting normal, if not a little out of it. They even had pictures of me doing things that I have no recollection whatsoever of doing. Really fucking scary. Never touched the stuff again.

I smoked that shit every day for 9 years and it fucked me up good and proper. Towards the end serious paranoia, memory loss, anxeity, depression etc not to mention the state of my lungs. Maybe it wasnt just weed and some of it was all the other things I hammered over the years but id defo say that was number 1. For anybody who says its not addictive your kidding yourself. Ive now gone over 2 an a half years and even to this day I can still feel the impact its had on me. When you smoke it yourself you always try to make out its not that bad and everybody does it etc. Its only once you have quit you can see how dirty it is and I still see some of my friends that smoke it that are so fucking boring. Seperating themselfs from the outside world and all they want is there bit of smoke and their xbox or whatever lol very sad. It was my girlfriend that helped me stop. I got with her and she didnt do any drugs and I knew I wanted to stop but couldnt. I stopped hangin around with everybody I knew and just spent time with her. Thats the only way I could get away from it and even if we split up now, I would never start smoking it again. EVER!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very interesting... I myself smoked marijuana for about 15 years every day and when i was in my mid 30s, perhaps due to the development of the brain or other drugs, i could smoke it naymore. I will pace around the room for HOURS, i cant hear what people are saying, I can only hear my own voice in my own head. I drove my heart rate to 185bmp at 35 years old ( i went over to the treadmill to check HR because I thought i was dying once. Marijuana turned on me, or my brain turned on marijuana. I smoked it about 20 times in a row with anxiety attacks and then quit. it was the easiet thing in the world to quit, because the high was gone. <br /><br />FENTANYL ---&gt; I WOULD RATHER INJECT MUD INTO MY JUGULAR VEIN THEN GO THROUGH THIS BULLSHIT. It&#039;s the most dangerous drug in the world(that is popular) stay the fuck away or you will die .&nbsp; I know theres kids on here, you wanna twaddle with some heroin or blow, maybe some oxys? well ur an idiot but go ahead, but stay fucking clear of fentanyl kids (and men) the only excuse to try this shit is stage 4 cancer or a dying AIDS patient or something where you are going to DIE there is nothing recreational about this shit, your opiate dependance means nothing, stay clear, i mean this with my heart and if i knew a friend on fentanyl (there all dead now or missing) I would lock him in a room, feed him some methadone for a couple weeks and then release him.

				Alcohol<br /><br />It ruined the life of so many people around me, killed my family, make problems with child and alcoholic parents.... Very sad to see. This is the poison of this society, it closed your eyes and makes you a damn stupid animal thinking guy. Also, it is a real mess for the brain and all the body. One of the worse but<br /><br />in fact i hate all the drugs that turn your brain in a vegetable: cocaine, amphetamine, heroine (opiates), meth and so alcohol.<br /><br />The big problem with the people and those drugs, they take them because they hope to be better. BUT, you have to be in a good shape prior to take any drugs. You don&#039;t take drugs when you are not ok.

				Probably meth (only done it once)<br /><br />But maybe everything. All these stories are making me realize how deep in the hole I&#039;m getting with my drugs of choice. I regularly use alcohol and cocaine without any guilt. Then there&#039;s weed, adderall, and oh yeah, MDMA. I&#039;ve praised &#039;em all, now I hate &#039;em all, but I can&#039;t get away from it all. Weed is such a comforting drug in some ways. For the first few years at least, when you pay attention to how and when you use it, it opens your mind and body to so much. For me it became a ritual that&#039;s left me wondering how the hell I kept letting myself take it one step further. Why does knowing that everything will be eventually be fine make it so easy to turn my back on my own wisdom? Why am I telling myself that eventually it will all be fine instead of improving my life now. I&#039;m still young, but I&#039;m starting to realize how far behind you can get in just a year or two. I can&#039;t imagine what it must be like to be buried in ten years of constant drug use. Yet when I was new to everything, I couldn&#039;t see myself smoking weed more than a few times a week. Smoking weed all day, everyday was something I could never let myself do, but it happened. Hmm, enough of that rambling, say no to drugs kids!

				GHB. When it was legal to buy GBL (easily converted to GHB) in UK, me and my brother absolutely caned this stuff. It was messy. Like a benzo that makes you feel stimulated and horny and chat absolute bollocks at the same time. And if you took slightly too much it would render you unconscious and unresponsive. The GHB period went on for maybe six months. We shared it with a friend and all three of us ended up in hospital having passed out in public. My turn came walking round to my girlfriends: I started lapsing in and out of consciousness and bouncing off cars. A police van pulled up next to me and they started asking me questions. Through the haze I was thinking &quot;oh shit I&#039;ve got two 500ml water bottles of GHB in my bag&quot; but I was unable to speak. I vaguely remember being carried into hospital, luckily the cops had decided I was having some kind of fit and took me to A&amp;E.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the first time we got it, we were taking it continuously (every 2-4 hours 24/7) for about 3 weeks. When it ran out we got an unpleasant surprise: a nasty physical withdrawal syndrome; sweating, shaking, delusional thinking, anxiety and generally feeling unpleasantly overstimulated. Luckily it only lasted a couple of days.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next time we got some we vowed to be more careful: take regular breaks and not overdo it. Of course this soon fell by the wayside and we ended up in the same messy condition!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It became quite common for us to be thrown out of pubs/clubs &quot;you can&#039;t sleep in here mate!&quot;<br />We thought we were having the time of our lives but from the outside we must have looked a right state: shiny eyed leering men who kept falling asleep.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the high sodium content ( we made NaGHb) we had a constant strong salty taste in our mouths that you couldn&#039;t get rid of- god knows what it was doing to our kidneys!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One time I went to see my brother; he was wrapped in a blanket shaking so badly he was actually vibrating. He was blurred! It was bizarre, this was during a withdrawal. It was not long after that we decided to leave this strange drug alone.

				This thread is really good, helped me decide what I&#039;m going to stay away from for sure. I was looking into RC&#039;s, not really eager or enthused just a &quot;I wonder how this feels&quot; kind of thing. Now I think I&#039;m going to just stay away. I have some acid, never done that before but will be soon. Mushrooms have been amazing for me so I know I&#039;m probably going to love it, but I can&#039;t imagine something ruining the thought of all future trips, that seems like it really sucks.<br /><br />With that said my list isn&#039;t as extensive as a lot of others on here but out of everything that I have done one thing I won&#039;t be doing again is cough syrup. I got caught up in the fad but honestly it&#039;s pointless. It&#039;s always overtaxed, addictive if abused (I didn&#039;t get to that point), and just leaves you tired and slumped. Not really the desirable drug for someone who tries to stay busy and active.

I did binge on it though. No other drug has felt so fucking toxic to me, and there is research coming out that points to it being nasty shit, although I don&#039;t know how much faith I put in any recreational drug research given that they are all government funded and lying fuckwads. Not to mention mephedrone is both vasioconstrictive (sp?) and inhibitory to the part of the brain that counters that, and it increases heart rate to boot, so it must be fucking horrible for the circulatory system and heart. And it is until recently almost completely unresearched, and has given some people negative health effects mimicking autoimmune disorders, caused peoples knees to turn purple. It made the entire inside of my mouth get blisters in it and all kinds of nasty shit. If there is one drug I wish I never used in my life it is beyond any doubt mephedrone. I also wish I didn&#039;t use so many/much disassociatives at such a young age. And I wish I didn&#039;t go research chemical crazy for a period of my life where I was tripping like three times a week for months. But that is just some regret over using way too much drugs, I still love to disassociate a lot, and still enjoy research chemicals in general. But mephedrone I wish I never even heard of honestly.

				and the thing is too that I felt fine while I was binging, but during/after the come down it all caught up with me suddenly. It is like a delayed effect set of bad effects and caught me totally off guard and unexpectedly, usually I am used to things happening during the peak and if they do not then I can continue going for it. Not a delayed effect whoop ass like that. Even though I do feel pretty much entirely over it now, as much as I will ever be I am sure, I still question if I did some damage to my circulatory system or something. The only things I am really concerned about regarding my drug use, is the effect my dissociative use may have had on my brain, and the effects mephedrone may have had on me in general. Although I also do regret smoking some research chemicals now, which in hindsight and now that I am not so young I see was fucking stupid, although it had no apparent negative effect on me. <br /><br />But all and all I would say I don&#039;t really regret using anything to the point that I would not use it at all, although some shit I would certainly have used more responsibly and to a lesser extent and starting at a later age. Mephedrone is only exception, I wish I never touched it. And I have used:<br /><br />DXM (highly doubt I ever use it again as ketamine pwns the shit out of it)<br />weed<br />cocaine (may do again but not a fan of it at all)<br />crack (would never do this again either)<br />heroin<br />meth<br />amphetamine<br />mushrooms<br />MDMA<br />GHB<br />ketamine (yum yum I use this a ton in binges that are separated with decent chunks of time, one of my favorite drugs)<br />mephedrone (never again, ever)<br />cp-55940<br />jwh-018<br />2c-i<br />2c-b<br />2c-e<br />2c-t-2<br />2c-t-21<br />5-meo-amt<br />5-meo-dmt<br />5-meo-dipt<br />4-aco-mipt<br />4-aco-dmt<br />LSD (one of the only things I still enjoy using a ton of)<br />salvia (is okay. Kind of weird. Would definitely use it again)<br />DMT<br />nitrous oxide<br />various pills, pharmaceutical and &quot;MDMA&quot;, although I have never been much into opiates or street ecstasy (have used a ton of benzos though)<br /><br />just off the top of my head I always forget shit though<br />

				Thanks, OP. Love this thread. I read it from front to back. <br /><br />I just want to offer the harm reduction angle. Some people probably won&#039;t be dissuaded from using substances by the negative experience of others. (Alcohol comes to mind). <br /><br />So, please do your homework and take all evidence-based harm reduction precautions. There is a body of evidence for harm reduction strategies for many of the substances we&#039;re discussing here. <br /><br />And, if there is no evidence of harm reduction strategies, chances are the substance is too new/experimental to be risked (research chemicals or RCs). In my experience, one cannot &quot;feel&quot; the damage being done, so don&#039;t conclude there isn&#039;t any. On the contrary, assume there is damage from everything, and seek to ameliorate the damage in every possible way (less frequency, lower doses, healthy lifestyles, fewer drug combinations, thoughtful settings and harm reduction). <br /><br />Use all reasonable harm reduction strategies, and you&#039;ll use drugs more safely and more enjoyably for longer.

Love this thread. I read it from front to back. <br /><br />I just want to offer the harm reduction angle. Some people probably won&#039;t be dissuaded from using substances by the negative experience of others. (Alcohol comes to mind). <br /><br />So, please do your homework and take all evidence-based harm reduction precautions. There is a body of evidence for harm reduction strategies for many of the substances we&#039;re discussing here. <br /><br />And, if there is no evidence of harm reduction strategies, chances are the substance is too new/experimental to be risked (research chemicals or RCs). In my experience, one cannot &quot;feel&quot; the damage being done, so don&#039;t conclude there isn&#039;t any. On the contrary, assume there is damage from everything, and seek to ameliorate the damage in every possible way (less frequency, lower doses, healthy lifestyles, fewer drug combinations, thoughtful settings and harm reduction). <br /><br />Use all reasonable harm reduction strategies, and you&#039;ll use drugs more safely and more enjoyably for longer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im kinda secretly hoping the new RCs (nbomes mostly) are linked to penile growth....lol wake up one morning like woah must of been all that 25i<br /><br />but yea Rcs are scary since theyve been around less then a decade and not many have had LD50s done.<br /><br />Moderation is key to life in all you do

				I probably wont ever do Salvia again. The comedown is awful and very hot/sweaty. The experience isn&#039;t very pleasant. <br /><br />RCs, specifically for incense and bath salt, I&#039;d never ever do again. They can&#039;t replace the real thing. Consistency is non-existent. One batch was SUPER addictive, one batch did nothing, one batch was just right, coming off the substances gave me awful WD and definitely did some damage. Took several weeks to feel better.<br /><br />Sticking to time tested natural medicines

				FENTANYL -- i recieved a post about this so im going to illiterate. Many are saying RC&#039;s and mephedrone and other shit like alcohol or whatever. Its all understandable because its what drug would you never do AGAIN. But fentanyl you never do. you never touch this drug ever or you will die. I would rather burn off all the skin on my body then smoke a fentanyl patch. You definately will die if you use this, its only to be used by people who are going to die, its perscribed wrong so much in the past and even today.&nbsp; Dont listen to the doctors, dont ask for it if youre in pain, do heroin or oxycodone or anything else because you will die with fentanyl. only if youre about to die do you use this. you do not use this if you are trying to get off opiates, or if you have even the smallest chance of living through cancer or any other painful disease or anything of fufcking anything. Im rampaging because only through experience will you know that fentanyl makes meth and crack look recreational. do not use fentantyl ever. Dwindle with heroin and Oxys because if you use fentanyl, youre going to die. youre goign to die financially because its so expensive, and youre goign to die spiritually, and youre also going to be dead very soon.<br /><br />Final Note: if youre ever offered this by a friend or doctor, even in serious pain, find an alternative and decline fentanyl. you will die. and i care for you guys.&nbsp; even though most of you are drug addicts to some degree. you can never take this drug or you will die, oh and another thing... you cant quit.&nbsp; if you know an aquantance who uses/used fentanyl, immidiately disconnect from this person. walk right out the room and never talk to them again.&nbsp; If it a close friend or family, you must lock them in a room for a few weeks and feed them methadone (withdrawl will kill them). once you release them, support them fully and tell them how much you love them.&nbsp; Physical restraints such as this is the only way to help them. You must do this if you LOVE them. once again, if you dont love them, just immidiately disconnect from them forever.

The instant I started coming back into reality all I could think was &#039;Oh god have I finally gone too far with my drug use and fucked up my head beyond repair?&#039;. I felt normal within the hour but it took days to shake the trip from my mind. Since I tried DMT I&#039;ve been unable to enjoy LSD, Shrooms, 2C-B or any other trippy drug, because it just reminds me of the DMT and gives me really bad anxiety until I eat a bunch or Benzo&#039;s or take GBL and pass out.

Once you open yourself to the experience you will enjoy it much better.

				What&#039;s with all the bad experiences on psychedelics? IMO, it&#039;s your own mind that is too unconditioned and unclear to enjoy the experience... I&#039;ve had nothing but good times on psych&#039;s. The only issue I ever had was my own doing and was the result of plain old abuse of the drug. I&#039;ve never had a bad trip, I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like. At the beginning of my psychedelic experimentation I would ingest heavy doses of DOC/2C-E or whatever I could find and go tripping in the woods at night, completely alone for hours, always with some Mars Volta to add to the intensity. I found this &quot;diving in head first&quot; method to work wonders. I had to come face to face with the flipped-inside-out raw core of my psyche, and I just dealt with it till I enjoyed it. I loooooove solo trips more than anything. Even on my 12mg+ binges of DOC...<br /><br />That being said, the only two substances I&#039;d never touch again with a ten-foot pole lest I was bound and gagged and faced anal gang rape by every African American in the NBA would be alcohol and alprazolam or most other benzo&#039;s. Alcohol for the obvious reasons... Purely unhealthy and a waste of consciousness that I feel was put here to keep the ignorant masses sedated. And Benzo&#039;s... Oh benzo&#039;s... Sure, they help ya sleep, but the number of times I woke up with vague recollections of dangerous misadventures such as cruising through my town&#039;s &#039;hood&#039; at 3am, nearly getting robbed, giving a couple drunk hookers a ride and almost being forced to smoke crack has led me to stay far away from those fuckers...<br /><br />Still freaks me out to this day.<br />

				LSD or shrooms. Had both multiple times. The first couple of trips I enjoyed, but evry subsequent trip results in extreme paranoia and it is horrible. Taking LSD or shrooms is one of my greatest fears. Dont know if its related, but cannabis also makes me very paranoid. I used to smoke every day and really enjoy it, then it just started making me very anxious. Can&#039;t smoke it now. One toke is enough to make me want to go home and hide under the bedcovers til it stops. I&#039;m talking in a room with your best friends and unable to speak or leave kind of anxiety.

				Speed!<br /><br />Fucking speed!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D<br /><br />Well to be more exact &#039;street speed&#039;, the batched made by chemistry students or even those with degrees and no work! <br /><br />You can read my night mare trip experience in the speed forums somewhere, I bought from a German vendor boymaster, and took 50mg in a&nbsp; couple of lines which was agony! After the normal burn effect snorting I was euphoric, should have stuck to that 50mb but unwisely decided to bomb another 50mg for the pub!&nbsp; Was building up to going to the pub so took it early. Then the euphoria became a niggling slight hedache followed by pain which anyone who has had a &#039;cluster headache&#039; will understand. I was breathing fast, sweating, then cold and it took me a week before I even felt normal again. I flushed the 900mg down the toilet along with about 7 gram of speed.<br /><br />Worse experience I ever had on a drug. Made a bad LSD trip seem tame.<br /><br />So be careful when buying speed as you never know the strength. Had I stayed at 50mg I would have been ok, but would have drank about ten pints and been up all night. A it happened I was fully clothed in bed actually groaning out load. <br /><br />I can take dexadrine which is 5mg per tab of med grade amphetamine you can eat on and sleep on after a few hours. Way superior to the hit and miss situation we have with speed. One week 2 gram was doing nothing, the next week 100mg pretty much would have seen me hospitalised had anyone seen me. A quick Valium I would have been ok. I keep Valium or diazepam for emergencies. Had a buddies girl with a panic attack a few days back, she slid on ice and crashed the car! She has the valium after crashing!<br /><br />So, for me, I&#039;d not evne take a kilo of speed for free. <br /><br />And I was a bit of a fiend in my early 20s when I would do 500mg a night. But it was always hit and miss. That is why I will only use a pharmacy grade amphetamine med. You always know what the dose is and never feel like shit for a week afterwards, in fact, the comedown is the easiest of most stimulants I have ever had. Addiction potential sure but if used every so often it always perks you up&nbsp; - 1 tab to perk up, two to maybe be a bit euphoric like you had a line of top coke and 3 for manic mights of much alcohol partaken, fine wines and vintage champagne! Asda 2012!<br /><br />So - I will NEVER do speed again and would not take it for free. I would not even sell it as the experience I had I&#039;d hate to be the one who enabled that. Had I took 200mg of that boymaster speed I think I would have been dead. A gram of it, dead for sure. <br /><br />So be careful because speed like that can catch you out. Always start with a small dose. I&#039;d also say do not snort it as it damaged your nose badly if you get used to snorting fat lines. <br /><br />I realise speed can be great fun, when its fairly pure and you take a sensible dosage it can make a party swing. Just be careful as its got addictive potential especially if your the socially awkward type. speed gives confidence but use too much and you iwll rely on it just to make it to the pub!<br /><br />And, have great weekend out there.

				Cocaine.&nbsp; Did it twice and will never touch it again.&nbsp; <br /><br />The first experience was a decently sized line.&nbsp; I felt myself rising up and was extremely restless, a bit jittery, but still unmotivated to do anything.&nbsp; Essentially, I was just explaining the effects to my partner at with a more speedy and open personality.&nbsp; It seemed to only last about 20 minutes.&nbsp; I called it a night.<br /><br />The second experience was from a different batch and I assumed I now understood why people kept redosing (as it&#039;s such a short high).&nbsp; I took the challenge and kept dosing throughout the nice.&nbsp; I basically spent my evening sitting in a chair, talking my head off, and fidgeting my legs and hands or walking around the room in search of something but having no idea what I was looking for by time I got up.&nbsp; I would assume I smoked damn near a pack of cigarettes in about 3-4 hours.<br /><br />I don&#039;t enjoy the high at all.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather dose 30-50mg of Vyvanse and have a nice boost for 12 hours over it.

				Well they call me monster for a reason. I love all drugs. I know no one will believe this, but I have never experienced withdrawal or even a hangover. I love not being in this world. Every day I take huge amount of whatever I can get my hands on and just flirt with death. My worst experience with any drug has been with my mdma use. I just get pissed and inevitably just lose it at someone.<br /><br />The drug which I no longer do is weed. Not for any real reason. It&#039;s just I use to smoke weed and do nothing else. I remember the first time I took lsd. I immediately said fuck you to weed. I mean weed is some pussy shit compared to meth, heroin, and all my other favorite goodies.<br />Still on a dry day ill smoke whole packs of cigarettes at a time. <br />To be honest with myself I&#039;m gonna die any day now.

				.........also speed was another no no for me. My mate (best mate at the time) used to sell it. Get it quite cheap like £100 a oz but this was propa pure paste.. seriously strong..argh I can still imagine the taste now. Thing is though me and my mate took it that much it started to taste nice and before we knew it we were eating 5g each straight off the knife :/ in 1 go... staying up for 9 nights in a row one time and literally getting sectioned for the night in scarborough hospital for trying to eat eachother haha no joke! Thats how bad we got! I lost so much sleep an weight everyone thought i was on smack! Also alcohol!! Defo up there on the worst of all list! when I stopped smoking dope due to mental problems etc I substituted it for drink.. Not a good idea as I am a arsehole when drunk and I dont know when to stop.This resulted in me becoming a full blown alcoholic for nearly a year! 300 units a week average. I know what your thinking lol.. this lad has an addictive personality.. well yes I do but I know now the things i really need to stay away from. WEED fucked my life in general! ALCOHOL to replace the weed fucked up my marriage (and a lot of social situations)..SPEED deprived me of food, sleep and happiness.

				For me there are actually two. One are shrooms. I&#039;ve gotten paranoid off of weed when not in the right setting, and shrooms was 1000 times worst for me. I just don&#039;t think I can handle psychedelics. The second, and I am not sure which one specific drug it was, but I once had a fake mdma pill. Don&#039;t know if it was BZP, Mcpp, or whatever, but it had no eurphoria and I felt like I was tweaking for a good 8 hours. Crazy stuff.&nbsp;

It helps to have a Valium or 2 before I take something to calm the anxiety or even better a nice 200mg dose of MDMA putts you in a brilliant happy mindset for a trip. Also known as a candy flip (with LSD) or hippy flip (with mushrooms) usually now the only way I do them.. Much happier more visual trip and almost no possibility of it going bad.. Always remember to redose MD after a couple hours though :)))

				This is a great thread, lots of interesting answers.<br /><br />It&#039;s important to remember that there are no good or bad drugs though, they&#039;re inanimate substances. It&#039;s how they are used and the person using them that matters. <br />Personally I never say never but I&#039;m not a huge fan of weed anymore for many of the reasons already stated. Also I don&#039;t like speedy tweaky highs anymore, stuff like mephedrone, mdpv, speed, and meth. Only stimulant I like is cocaine and that&#039;s only when It&#039;s really clean stuff not cut with anything speedy.<br />Only thing I&#039;ve learned from stimulants is there&#039;s no highs without a following low.

				i would never eat over 2 grams of shrooms after my last shroom experience. ive eaten full 8th&#039;s before and never had a problem, but i guess these were just supa dank. I ate 3.8g of them with no food, on an empty stomach and washed them down with OJ. was tripping balls no more than 20 minutes later. Smoked a blunt 30 minutes after eating and thats when shit started hitting the fan. 2 out of the 3 of us tripping had the worst times of our lives. Im thinking smoking the bud had something to do with it but im not even gonna risk it again.

				Well I just used up my savings on a ball of &quot;pure&quot; coke from a very popular vendor here. It cost me a pretty penny, I said to myself OK this is going to last me for the next 3 weekends &quot;yeah right&quot;. I decided that since I&#039;ve never had such &quot;pure&quot; coke in my life that It would be a good idea to cook it up. Big mistake, long story short I smoked the ball in 4 hours. I am so depressed from the comedown and the fact that I smoked $400. I can&#039;t buy anything for at least another 3-4weeks which also sucks balls. I&#039;m broke now. I vow never to cook Coke ever again that was the worst experience I&#039;ve had with drugs, the during was fucking great, but the after was NOT worth the 4 hours of joyful bliss. I know I did it right too cause I was skeeted as fuck, never felt like that in my life off powder, still not worth it. GAHHHH

Ive had loads of amazing experiences on acid and a few bad ones also. There was 1 that was much worse in paticular where I had been awake for 3 full nights on speed and the setting was bad...It was the most intense horrifying trip I have ever had. It felt like it lasted weeks long and I turned psychotic going propa crazy in the pure evil hell like world! Made me think a lot about mindframe for any psychedelics after that!

I went through my first &#039;rehab&#039; <br />back in 1982! - Then there was no such thing as a &#039;rehab&#039; - I was just out of high school and addicted to Valium and Quaalude mixed with Alcohol.&nbsp; Came out clean for a period, and a few years later., Cocaine! was the new &#039;in&#039; drug of the mid 80&#039;s , back to rehab, get out, stay clean <br /><br />Some years later, I was getting panic attacks, due to a high pressure job in NYC.

XANAX&nbsp; ::)<br />I kid you not, that is how Xanax was pushed when it first came out.<br />Yep! You guessed it. Back to rehab! <br /><br />That was over 20 years ago, and since then, I&#039;ve learned to take what works. I even can smoke weed again and enjoy it! - Never thought I would. Just a few hits here and there, with a friend who shares what he&#039;s got, and I share back. <br /><br />My big long drawn out point is. - Everybody&#039;s different. and just cause someone puts down your favorite drug, you don&#039;t have to take it personally. That&#039;s them, you&#039;re you.<br /><br />A little libertarianism goes a long way. <br /><br />I like amphetamine myself, never liked speed EVER, but it works for me now, and I&#039;ll keep doing it, as long as it works for me, (orig Rx&#039;d Adderall for adult ADD-Pi) <br />I have adult ADD, shitty health insurance, so buying 1g for $40 of excellent amphetamine, works out a lot better than buying from these kids for $15-$20 for a 30mg adderall. <br />For the price of 2 30mg Addy&#039;s I can get 1000mg&#039;s very good amphetamine (equivalent to a little over $1 per pill)&nbsp; Most of these brats get it free from their parents insurance, and sell it at a ridiculous markup! I guess there&#039;s people doing a lot better than me finacially out there, because they&#039;re buyin &#039;em! :-\<br /><br />But hey! That&#039;s Capitalism! See how good it works with when unregulated free trade is allowed to flourish, as The Silk Road proves over and over again?&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Loved this thread! - Excuse me for going on a little long. I had a burning desire to make my point. I hope some &#039;got it&#039;. <br /><br />Peace 8)<br /><br />jagfug :P

Back to rehab! <br /><br />That was over 20 years ago, and since then, I&#039;ve learned to take what works. I even can smoke weed again and enjoy it! - Never thought I would. Just a few hits here and there, with a friend who shares what he&#039;s got, and I share back. <br /><br />My big long drawn out point is. - Everybody&#039;s different. and just cause someone puts down your favorite drug, you don&#039;t have to take it personally. That&#039;s them, you&#039;re you.<br /><br />A little libertarianism goes a long way. <br /><br />I like amphetamine myself, never liked speed EVER, but it works for me now, and I&#039;ll keep doing it, as long as it works for me, (orig Rx&#039;d Adderall for adult ADD-Pi) <br />I have adult ADD, shitty health insurance, so buying 1g for $40 of excellent amphetamine, works out a lot better than buying from these kids for $15-$20 for a 30mg adderall. <br />For the price of 2 30mg Addy&#039;s I can get 1000mg&#039;s very good amphetamine (equivalent to a little over $1 per pill)&nbsp; Most of these brats get it free from their parents insurance, and sell it at a ridiculous markup! I guess there&#039;s people doing a lot better than me finacially out there, because they&#039;re buyin &#039;em! :-\<br /><br />But hey! That&#039;s Capitalism! See how good it works with when unregulated free trade is allowed to flourish, as The Silk Road proves over and over again?&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />Loved this thread! - Excuse me for going on a little long. I had a burning desire to make my point. I hope some &#039;got it&#039;. <br /><br />Peace 8)<br /><br />jagfug :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gave up hash/getting stoned years ago myself as it stopped working for me anymore. It started making me paranoid and unsociable so realised it wasn&#039;t for me anymore but have tried it once or twice lately and have enjoyed it again thinking I never would!<br /><br />Speed was the drug available where I&#039;m from back in the early - mid 90&#039;s but disappeared as did a lot of other drugs that were always available and now with SR making it possible to get my hands on it again I gotta get some to try it again. Used to love the waffling away on speed!<br /><br />Coke is my drug at the moment after years of avoiding it. MDMA is my favourite combined with the music to go with it! :-)

				All is good, All is bad....<br /><br />I&#039;m more afraid of myself on drugs than the product itself. I sometimes love so much to be high on my fav product that i can easily slip into addiction quickly.<br />I think i&#039;m an addictive type person. Even with non-drug stuff, like a hobby or a sport. I get hooked and kinda obsessed and i can do it till nausea... And with drugs, nausea means withdrawal...painful.<br /><br />I snorted heroin twice years ago, very good white fine powder and had a wonderful time. That scared the shit out of me afterwards. I liked it.... and due to its reputation, i decided not to touch it anymore.<br /><br />And even if i keep some xanax for coming down of amph binges(my fav), i&#039;ll never use it anymore for something else.&nbsp; I experienced a withdrawal after a bit more than a month of daily use (1/2 mg a day; not that much)&nbsp; after some rough times in my life to help me not being so depressed and get some sleep, and that was on of the worst week of my life. Cold sweating all day, no sleep, heart racing with anxiety waves. Giong to work was very painful, feeling tired, irritable and almost more depressed than i was before.<br />Fuck benzos!! <br /><br />Last, to balance a bit the so many &quot;salvia sucks&quot; posts, dit it about 5-7 times i loved it, but was aware that it was not going to be recreationnal but lot more spiritual, and it was. I traveled far away, became an aztec style motif that was part of a giant mosaic, got rolling on the floor laughing so hard and so strange for 15 min that my friend wanted to call the ER and i tried to tell them everything was perfectly fine but couldn&#039;t talk which made me laugh more and more.... Really great. Comedown for me is so smooth, my mind is ultra-clear, i can think of the worst problems in my life without trying to avoid those thoughts as i normally do.<br />But i don&#039;t know if i&#039;ll do it again because it needs you to be involved and spiritual, and this is not always easy as becoming older fills my mind with more responsabilities and the worries that come with. If i trip, i wanna be clear with myself to avoid being shocked by ego-death or reality jumping in my face.<br />&nbsp;I know many friends who dit salvia like they would do LSD, with the intention to funtrip together and ended to bad trip. Salvia is NOT about fun, is is about YOU.(more than any other psych i tried: shrooms, lsd, dmt, 2cb) <br /><br />++

				A very long time ago I unknowingly smoked weed laced with PCP. It was by far the most confusing and unpleasant high I&#039;ve ever experienced. I know any drug (for the most part) can be pleasant with the right set and setting, but I have no desire to ever try PCP again.

I personally have never had a bad experience on any drug at all, but I will never mess with 2c-p again after my senior prom night.<br /><br />I did a ton of research on 2-cp and thought it would be the shit. When it was still easily able to be bought online I bought a gram for 70$ dollars. Then I bought a 70 dollar scale to weigh milligrams, and 100 capsules. My buddies and I managed to cap about 109 2c-p capsules and sold 5 to some trippy ass kicks we knew. (By kids I mean 19 year old high school dropouts)<br /><br />Like 6 hours later at 2 am i got a phone call and these guys were asking me to come outside my house like there was a party going on. I went outside and got in their truck and they were having the time of their lives blasting music, dancing, and telling me about the crazy adventures they been going on. I was excited to know how good my new drug was, I was about to make a fortune.<br /><br />That weekend five of my best friend each did one and we thought it was one of the best drugs we had ever done. We LOVED it, the drug is magical we talked, laughed, loved and laid around for hours talking about crazy stuff. SO everyone in my area found out about this stuff and were crawling out of the wood works for it. I traded 3 for eighths of weed, ozs of codeine, acid, molly, and money. Anyway my senior prom came around and my 5 best friends and I went it was 2 guys and 3 girls we all went together as druggie friends haha.<br />We took one before and had a blast, then on the limo ride home my friend Hillary took another half and everything was cool. We partied through the night with tons of glow stick, globes, and the glove lights. I&#039;m not entirely sure if Hillary took another after that, but at about 530 am we were all sitting on the driveway and suddenly she starts telling us how much she hates us. We thought she was kidding and just kept messing with her. Then she started freaking out about ants on her and ran into the house. She threw the huge commercial container of animal crackers around her house.<br />She eventually ran into the backyard yelling and we were like &quot;fuck lets get her inside this is a rich neighborhood someone will call the cops&quot;.<br />I grabbed her and sat her between my legs holding her and she just started throwing up all over me and flailing around. She pulled the blinds of the wind and was yelling. At this point he mind was gone. She would say only 4 words in this scary almost exorcism kind of voice. &quot;WATER WATER I NEED WATER&quot; &quot;CLOCK TIME PHONE WATER&quot; &quot;AIR AIR I NEED AIR&quot; we gave her a cup of water and she couldn&#039;t even hold it. We tried to give her Xanax to calm her down but she just threw it up.<br />Next thing you know we carried her to the bathtub and just held her as tightly as possible with the cold water running until she stopped tripping. It was like 5 hours. Eventually she was just like &quot;omg can you leave so I can change&quot;<br />You cant imagine how scary this was especially because everyone involved was also tripping. Some say we should have called the ambulance, but I have no regrets shes alive and well, still one of my best friends.<br /><br />Another guy I know, I sold it to him and warned him to take only one but who knows how many he took.<br />One day his friends called me and said &quot;yo man willie was yelling and punching shit talking about aliens so his mom called the police. When the police got there he tackled a cop and the other one tazed him&quot; I saw willie a couple weeks later and all I could say was sorry.<br /><br />Don&#039;t fuck with 2c-p unless you are mature enough to only take the 10to13 milligrams<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Can&#039;t get anymore didactic than this..

I looked in the mirror and thought I had a third eye above my forehead. <br /><br />I was completely disoriented with as close as I have come to an ego loss as possible and it was god awful. I did learn from it of course, especially of my fear of the unknown, and I do not regret it, but just from the severity of that trip I do not see myself able to ever have a good time on the drug again due to the stigma that my mind will always attach to it.<br /><br />So I say it again: salvia, fuck that shit

				Someone laced a joint with PCP and smoked it with me w/o saying anything. I took lie 6 hits, and couldn&#039;t move for about 45 minutes, with a sound in my head that reminded me of the sizzling of high voltage power lines. I proceeded to projectile vomit everywhere, and could only see in shades of red for hours. It happened while I was watching a friend&#039;s band at a bar (next to a police station), and was almost arrested when I was puking in the alleyway next to the precinct.<br /><br />Other than that, I absolutely hate alcohol. In 2010, the Lancet released a study that said alcohol was worse (overall) than heroin and cocaine, when including social and physical implications (look at where shrooms, LSD, and MDMA fall). I completely agree with the study. Cannabis harm to others&#039; would be nearly nonexistent if it were legal (like it should be).<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11660210<br /><br />I try to avoid alcoholics like the plague, and haven&#039;t had a single (social) drink in over two years...don&#039;t miss it one bit. I&#039;ve averaged maybe 1 or 2 nights of drinking a year since early in college. I figure I used to spend at least $100 at a bar (buying rounds n drinking top shelf) in a night, basically to not remember much of the evening, make stupid decisions (that could easily have affected my life), and feel like ass. For $100 on SR...shit, son. That&#039;s a different story. You could party for days on $100 here, with abounding epiphanies and wonderful, enlightening memories to last a lifetime.

				&nbsp;I&#039;m with you on the whole alcohol thing, ekoostik. I don&#039;t drink myself. I hate it. I used to get drunk, stupid drunk, every night and wake up feeling shitty all the next day. Then I&#039;d go get drunk again cuase I felt terrible and start the vicious cycle all over again. I quit 8 years ago. <br /><br />But the drug I would NEVER ever do again is nitrous. The last time I did it, I took a big ole balloon hit and the next thing I know, I&#039;m on the ground and my head is bleeding, and my friends are all around me looking concerned&nbsp; asking me if I was OK.

I got with her and she didnt do any drugs and I knew I wanted to stop but couldnt. I stopped hangin around with everybody I knew and just spent time with her.

				This is the thing about drugs that makes you realize how uninformed a lot people are and why people get sick, OD or end up in a lot of discomfort.&nbsp; If you&#039;re going to do drugs, you have to fucking prepare!&nbsp; If you&#039;re gonna go up, doing coke or chrystal, then have some Oxy to come down with and some Xanax to further the taper down effect.&nbsp; Shoot for the moon if you want but have a parachute so that you can land on not break your legs.&nbsp; Be a practitioner of modern chemistry, don&#039;t just go out and get whacked on Molly or MDMA and then expect to feel like you&#039;re ready to run a marathon the next day.&nbsp; Otherwise, be prepared to get bitten by the dog that jumped on that took your so far up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admittedly, I&#039;ve partied a little more than I should have been in the past but that has come to a halt.&nbsp; Good times can only go on for so long and responsibilities must be dealt with accordingly, we can&#039;t just get high everyday or it will catch up with you.&nbsp; Be responsible, if you take something that is going to get you high, make sure that you have something to let you down softly so that you can essentially have a pillow to rest your head on when you&#039;re coming down.&nbsp; You can get high as a fucking kite on Friday, but then if you&#039;ve got the Xanax and Oxy or Hydrocodone to let you down easy, you can rest up and relax and enjoy your Saturday, eat some foods, replenish your body.&nbsp; No reason to crash. Crashing is no fun... so straddle the horse of modern chemistry and be well prepared before you dabble with it, or else it will bite you.&nbsp; Nothing is good if exceeded in moderation.&nbsp; Alcohol included, although I do believe it or not truly enjoy the following day when I&#039;m hung over and it&#039;s a Sunday and I can just stay in bed, make a nice breakfast and watch some good movies.&nbsp;

				25i-nbome. I&#039;ve done psychedelic drugs close to a thousand times in my life without much issues, but I&#039;ve taken this drug 3 times and each time I had a very nasty bad trip followed by ego death less than a few minutes after coming up then spending the rest of the night fried and feeling gross.<br /><br />

				Most likely will not get around to doing Salvia again. I had quite the horrifying, Lovecraftian death sentence at the age of 17 on way too much 100x+ extract, and a decade and some later I&#039;m still not willing to revisit. It is truly an agonizing, maybe even borderline evil plant. I really wish I had managed to milk it for at least one &quot;good&quot; or &quot;decent&quot; experience but I never did. Hell, I think it precipitated lifelong generalized anxiety and perhaps even PTSD for a few years there. I admit that I have been reading about a tea / tincture that someone wrote a powerful and convincing report on over at Bluelight. I&#039;m tempted just to rid myself of the stigma (I don&#039;t like to discriminate against any drugs just because of a bad experience.) I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to happen though.

				crack cocaine.&nbsp; And the people who smoke crack. After trying it out, hanging around ppl who smoke it, and watching them do the things they do so they can &quot;get another hit&quot; I can honestly say that this is the drug from the devil. I have used cocaine (powder) for many years before this experience and crack is much much worse. Its like those gamblers. Theyll keep spending all their money until they have none left

				crack. I lost my son over it, loved him more than any mom could love their kid, didnt do anything bad to him or anything he just told his dad and his dad kidnapped him and i tried to get him back and couldnt and just got into more trouble&nbsp; havent seen him for 8 years and probably never will as I have a fatal disease. i am glad hes doing well though. Went to prison trying to get him back (though his dad lied about what happened) so that too proly because cops were told I had smoked crack by him so they made it so i couldnt see him or have any contact and he hates me now i guess. Ignores my apologies now that he&#039;s an adult. I ruined my life and i still will do it if its free. because I have nothing to live for anymore anyway and in pain. And my life couldnt be any more fucked up than it already is. Jus sayin&#039; you dont even have to lose ur ass financially but LE and vengeful exes can use drugs against you and going to jail and being a felon is a stigma for life esp as i was a professional. Now Im&nbsp; next to homeless w/o insurance and live in chronic pain. Opiates are the only thing that help but always scared of withdrawals. That being said, taking LSD was a good decision back many many years ago. And shrooms. I dont smoke much weed these days but it is a good thing for many people imo. And used to be good for pain.

				DMT <br /><br />It was fine for a while but turns out you can go too far down the rabbit hole, LSD is great however the best drug in the world in my opinion.&nbsp; I think DMT has potential and there is definitely something there if you get what I mean, but fuck I can&#039;t handle the intense solipism anymore.

				I&#039;ve been around for over 5 decades and did a lot of drugs in the 15-30 age time frame.&nbsp; I was a full blown pot head the whole time and enjoyed it.&nbsp; I also did about everything that was available back in those days except heroin.&nbsp; Never ever shot anything up and never will.&nbsp; I did quite a few trips of acid when I was younger but didn&#039;t take any for quite awhile and then the next few trips I had bad experiences.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 1st bad one was in Seattle.&nbsp; I lived downtown, so was used to the buzz of the big city and the way the city changed from being jam packed during the work day and then changing to the seedy crowd at night.&nbsp; I had tickets to the Cars and went to the bar after work to start on getting drunk.&nbsp; I was putting them down pretty good and was stoned, then my dealer said they had some acid.&nbsp; Dumb me said that would be cool to get fucked up and go to the Cars concert.&nbsp; &nbsp; About 10 years earlier, I had taken acid and went to a Cars concert and it was a very spacy night, so I guess I was thinking I could relive that one again.&nbsp; I popped the tab and drank some more and then it was time to head on over there.&nbsp; I was starting to feel it coming on right before I left.&nbsp; Now living downtown, I didn&#039;t own a car (too expensive parking) so I took the bus everywhere.&nbsp; Riding the bus was something that I did everywhere I went to, it was a very normal thing for me. <br /><br />Well as soon as I got on the bus, I started freaking out.&nbsp; It was jammed packed (friday about 5:00) and I was standing up in the bus and I felt like everyone was staring at me.&nbsp; I was getting paranoid and freaking out big time.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t make it more them 3 blocks and I had to jump off the bus.&nbsp; I ran home (only about 3 blocks) and I was really freaking out.&nbsp; I knew the only way I was going to survive was to somehow get to sleep, cuz I knew when I woke up I would have came down.&nbsp; Now for anyone that&#039;s taken acid, going to sleep right when you&#039;re starting to trip is the LAST thing you know would ever happen.&nbsp; After all, you can drink gallons of beer and get high and it seems to never do much to you when you&#039;re tripping.&nbsp; &nbsp;I turned all the lights out and just laid there telling myself I was going to be ok and praying to go to sleep.&nbsp; Somehow I fell asleep and all was good.&nbsp; Really pissed me off though, got all primed up to have a great time and I ended up wasting 60 some bucks on the tickets and didn&#039;t hear a note. :)<br /><br />Acid is something you want to take with friends and you should be in the right frame of mind when you take it.&nbsp; I believe that was the first time I took it by myself.&nbsp; The 2nd time was either before that one or after that one, not sure.&nbsp; I took some acid with my dealers husband and we decided to take a ride on his Harley.&nbsp; It was a gorgeous day in Seattle.&nbsp; Clear blue skies, about 70 degrees.&nbsp; We decided to drive to Mt. Ranier about a hour away.&nbsp; Everything was fine on the way there, then as we&#039;re going up the mountain, it starts snowing.&nbsp; For some reason I started freaking because I felt like I was kind of melting and that I was going to fall off his motorcycle.&nbsp; He tried to talk me into being cool, but it wasn&#039;t working.&nbsp; I was having such a issue that he decided we needed to head back to the city.&nbsp; To this day, I will never forget how terrified i was on the way home.&nbsp; I had him in a death grip, it was the scariest time I can ever remember, riding on the back of a bike going 75 mph on the freeway feeling like I was going to fall off at any moment.&nbsp; To top it all off, I was a avid motorcyclist myself, having rode one most of my life.&nbsp; After that trip, I haven&#039;t ever took it again.<br /><br />Did crack a few times with a buddy who was hooked on it.&nbsp; Seeing him treat it like it as God&#039;s juice, I decided to try it, even after witnessing what it did to him.. freaking out looking out the window all the time.&nbsp; After taking a few hits, I had this uncontrollable urge to want another hit, then another.&nbsp; After that, I realized how addictive the drug was and never did it again.<br /><br />Mushrooms were always a nice high.&nbsp; Never did like coke at all.&nbsp; Hate any kind of speed shit.<br /><br />Someone gave me a pill one time, some kind of downer or something.&nbsp; Took it and feel asleep for several days.&nbsp; &nbsp;Swear to god, I took it, got tired after awhile and when I woke up my buddy was pounding on my door.&nbsp; Turns out I was out for a few days, missed work, didn&#039;t hear any of the hundreds of phone calls.&nbsp; Surprised no one called the cops to see if I was alive.&nbsp; That was the weirdest feeling in the world to have disappeared from the world for a few days and I remember nothing.&nbsp; I&#039;ll pass on whatever the fuck that pill was.<br /><br />Then I had to stop doing all drugs for the next 15 years due to random drug testing and being a responsible step-parent and husband.&nbsp; Then due to chronic pain taking over my life, I went to see a dr to help me.&nbsp; Nothing worked except oxycodone.&nbsp; I never really got high from them, but they made me be able to function again by taking the pain down a few notches.&nbsp; Pretty soon I was taking a prescription of about 100 mg a day.&nbsp; I usually did pretty good about my supply lasting 30 days, but one month I was really in a ton of pain and the pills wouldn&#039;t even touch it.&nbsp; I ended up being a week short and the I was in between being kicked out of my family dr&#039;s care and having to try to get into see a pain specialist.&nbsp; Well about 15 hours or so after taken my last pill I was trying to go to bed, had to work the next day.&nbsp; All the sudden my legs were rubbing against each other, I started thrashing about in bed, hot/cold sweats, had the shits every 1/2 hour, heart racing, mind racing.&nbsp; I was like that the entire night, didn&#039;t sleep one fucking minute.&nbsp; My wife was freaking out.&nbsp; After another entire day of that shit going on non-stop, I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and went to the ER.&nbsp; They gave me a IV with some oxy and xanex or ativan or something and it calmed me the fuck down.&nbsp; That was the worst feeling I&#039;ve ever felt in my life.&nbsp; I really thought I was going to die, from my heart giving out.<br /><br />It&#039;s been almost 2 years later and I&#039;ve went thru those symptoms practically every month sometimes for a day, sometimes for a few days.&nbsp; Each month I say I will never let that happen again, but my tolerance is so great now, that my same dosage I&#039;ve been on is not enough.&nbsp; My dr. I&#039;m afraid won&#039;t prescribe anymore or I risk him possibly taking me off them.&nbsp; It&#039;s a catch 22, I need them for my pain, but I can&#039;t get a higher dosage to make up for my tolerance.&nbsp; Now I have to take more then I&#039;m supposed to, just to keep the WD feeling from coming on every day.&nbsp; What really pisses me off, is I&#039;m not getting any kind of buzz from them.&nbsp; I hear everyone getting fucked up from them but people with real pain, tend to not get that euphoric feeling from them.&nbsp; Im a addict, but don&#039;t get the buzz, how fucked is that?<br /><br />So I got to get off these damn things somehow, starting this month to try and wean myself down so I can get off them and in doing that, I will not have to go thru hell at the end of the month.&nbsp; Fucking oxy&#039;s.&nbsp; The whole thing is fucked up.&nbsp; EVERY fucking month, when it comes time for refills, a week before I have to start worrying about whether I can make it and knowing what will happen if I don&#039;t.&nbsp; I have to worry about whether the dr. will suddenly not refill them.&nbsp; I have to worry about whether the pharmacy will refill them 2 days early.&nbsp; Then I get the script and I&#039;m ok for 3 weeks and then it all starts all over again.<br /><br />I&quot;m on SR now so I can start experimenting if actual medical marijuana can help with my pain so maybe I can wean myself off the oxy.&nbsp; Besides pot, I&#039;ve never been addicted to any drug, but this oxy shit is one fucking powerful fucking addiction.&nbsp; And if I don&#039;t take some of it, within 8 hours, the withdrawals start coming on.&nbsp; Not sleeping for 3 days, not eating for 3 days, squirting out your butt when you know there&#039;s nothing in there except your guts and rubbing your legs raw is the absolute worst feeling ever.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t wish that on my worst enemy.<br /><br />That&#039;s my story, sorry I&#039;m a man of few words :)

				^^ I really feel for you. I haven&#039;t experienced opiate addiction or withdrawal myself to any meaningful extent, but have you researched either Methadone or Suboxone (Buprenorphine) ? I haven&#039;t checked to see if either are available on SR, but I know and have witnessed that these two do have actual, perceptible (positive) effects on opiate addicts of any color. You may want to try weaning yourself off with these management drugs. I really hope you find a workable regiment (or even manage to do it drug-free!) The silk road, at it&#039;s best, is here to assist people like you. I hate to hear of your pain that is being caused by a government that has no empathy for its citizens.<br /><br />If neither of the above are effective or possible for you, (trusting that you have the money) Ibogaine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine#Therapeutic_uses) treatment may be a really good way to spend a 1-3 week treatment cycle dealing with your opioid addiction and pain management. It has been remarkably successful thusfar for people suffering from the same pain and addiction as yourself. Please, look into it. I really hope my post helps.<br /><br />Lastly, for sleep, get a bottle of Clonazepam, Ambien or Xanax (or any Benzo, really) to help force yourself to sleep in tough times. I guarantee that it has helped me suffer out deep depressive episodes and suicidally painful scenarios in my life, simply by sleeping.<br /><br />I wish you well.... We&#039;re all here for you.<br />

				Probably Hydro weed.<br /><br />Hydro weed makes me freak out and lose touch of what is real and what is not. Paranoia, wobble eyes, aural hallucinations. Terrible.<br /><br />However, outdoor weed I seem to respond very well to, if I&#039;m with good friends and with good vibes. Guaranteed giddiness and good high.<br /><br />Other than that, it&#039;s totally subjective. I personally love almost every drug I&#039;ve ever taken, but thats because I ALWAYS research what I take, take proper precautions, safety measures and dosages.<br /><br />Been 5 years of happy drug use of all different psychedelics and stimulants, and Hydro weed is so far the only bad time I&#039;ve had<br /><br />Oh and alcohol. Alcohol can be sometimes my best friend and worst fucking enemy. Many drunken destructive experiences, self harm, property damage, drink driving, fights.... Fuck that noise

If you can get some of his GDP your perspective of marijuana will change as a whole. Trader Joes also has guaranteed dank 100% straight from the dispensary. Both vendors both use mylar so your good there. <br /><br />again this is going off of experience, there may be better out there but i have over 170 transactions and these two vendors stood out the most when it comes to dank medical top shelf, the only weed i go for. <br /><br />but i smoke weed to get high. but i take more dabs than i do smoke weed because i like to get really high. but in your case you might be looking for some very strong concentrates to relieve pain. in that case, LionwareTradingCo is your man. I have ordered from most oil/wax vendors on SR and my broski Lionware blew me away! over and over!&nbsp; he&#039;s got that wax that smells and tastes like the best weed you&#039;ve ever had you just cant quite put your finger in it. <br /><br />sorry if i went off into a review type rant but im just trying to swing you in the right direction! trying to send some good vibes to ya cuz i could use all the good vibes i can get myself. best of luck and fuck those oxys.

				oh and i forgot to mention in my post how much money someone can spend on crack. A girl who i was friends with got into a serious car accident. Got close to 70,000 USD . Almost every penny was spent on crack within 6 months. And after she was done, one of her friends wanted more and wiped out her entire IRA retirement savings. I&#039;m never going near that shit gain. I&#039;m happy will my acid once in awhile and maybe some MDMA on special occasions :)

				stillnox (ambien) and then accidentally (due to stilnox) taking 200mg MXE...&nbsp; I have flashbacks of me walking the street.. pretty scary.. <br /><br />even worse was a few months later when I had stillnox and 3x 25i tabs... that was indescribable.. I think I woke up and was fucked. took me a few hours to figure out what was going on.. <br />I was just holding the 25i for friends as I dont like doing that... so it was abit of a surprise...<br /><br />It was wierd though.. I&#039;ve been having stilnox on and off for years (for rec fun) and never before had it taken hold like that.. twice :p<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t have it if I have any other substances around... <br /><br />

				any drug i&#039;ve done i&#039;ve enjoyed, but the hardest drug i&#039;ve done would be say MDMA or maybe some pills like xanax or something.<br /><br />but for suboxone I say i&#039;ve done it 3 times. There was the first time, the last time, and the only time. <br /><br />Dude at work gave me a little orange strip when i was 16 working at a fast food joint. I just wanted to catch a buzz before work you know how it is. He told me the high was just like hydrocodone so I thought cool this is gunna be a quick shift. <br /><br />Well, i threw the whole strip under my tongue and it wasnt that bad. At first i felt euphoric, but almost immediately the lights started to fade and my legs were wobbling as i would try to wrap a cheeseburger. Fellow employees said my skin was yellow and my lips were purple. i had the cold sweats and everything. Thought a cigarette would make me feel better, but that only made me puke. <br /><br />Eventually the nastiness went away and i was able to complete my shift. Thank god i had a badass manager. I would smoke her a lot so no problem there. But as soon as i got off, i was feeling fine again so i decided to smoke a blunt. All the shit came back again. The cold sweats came back, i began shaking again, just terrible feelings. I drove home and I had to shake my whole body back and forth while driving just to keep the road still. If i kept my head straight the road would begin to twist upside down, i had to get home. <br /><br />I was thinking i was going to get pulled over or some shit and that was it. I felt so damn good to be in my bed on that school night ha.

				Phenobarbital. Takes too much time to kick in then lasts for too fucking long. Pretty crappy buzz, too. There are better things to kill my liver with. Shorter-acting barbs are supposedly way more euphoric, but I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to try any other barbiturate.<br /><br />DXM in syrup form. Damn foul taste and consistency. (I feel ya, worm11)<br /><br />For all illicit or RC drugs I had negative experiences with, I usually had way more positive experiences (with the same substance) so can&#039;t rule any of them out. Bad trips can happen. I wouldn&#039;t ever _buy_ cocaine, though. Nice feeling, but pointless and way overpriced for what it actually gives.

				I&#039;m tempted to say diphenhydramine, but deep down I know that I&#039;ll end up doing it again. I only did it once but it was the craziest night I ever endured. The waves of dysphoria going through my body every few seconds, being startled at every sound, THE FUCKING SPIDERS, the shitty afterglow... The auditory hallucinations were the only good part. Listening to imaginary radio stations is fun.<br /><br />And like many people, DXM in syrup form. No one could pay me enough to chug a 250mL bottle of that disgusting, nasty, gag-inducing cum extract. I like DXM but that shit just isn&#039;t worth it.

				Heavent read through this post yet to see if anyone has said this one but ,,,,, GHB<br /><br />Back in College the first few times I did It I liked it, <br />Then One night at an outdoor camping music festivel we had a little bit of alcohol to drink ( we knew that you wernt supposed to drink alcohol and GHB together it was dangerous ) but I Had only had a little bit earlier.&nbsp; <br />Took a cap, started feeling good Rockin out, My vision going blurry like I was wasted but still feeling good. <br />Then it got out of hand, I Couldnt walk, I was hanging off a tree until I couldnt hold myself up I started rolling around on the ground puking I was so Disoriented I didnt know Which direction was up Literaly I didnt know what was the ground and what was the sky I was just spining and spining and puking , I never ever felt so sick and nausious and out of it in my life, I was praying to please make it be over soon&nbsp; lol (Like thats gonna work, &quot;You bought the Ticket, Take the ride&quot;) I dont know how long this went on for I eventually passed out and woke up to a girl waking me up because I was laying in the middle of the dirt roadway which people walked down and the ocasional car drove down as new campers showed up looking for a campsite.<br /><br />Never ever ever again, And I love Drugs of all shapes and sizes, a real unhealthy interest in mind altering substances but Fuckin forget that shit. It gives me the shakes just thinkin about it<br /><br />My advice if your thinking of trying it recreationaly dont, and of course its an evil substance for what else its used for so it should be abolished from this planet

So done with it.<br /><br />psychedelic&#039;s - Used to like the mind expanding properties but have realized I am done with the feeling of what they do to you. Too much of everything with nothing in return for me. So I am done with them as well.<br /><br />RC&#039;s - research chemicals are for RESEARCH not for me anymore.<br /><br />Amphetamines - Can be good, but don&#039;t do them because they don&#039;t provide a high I am looking for, maybe for staying up and finishing work you have but after that it&#039;s just a beating heart that won&#039;t calm down and nothing left for you.<br /><br />Only drug I now like.<br /><br />Cocaine. - pure euphoria with feelings that make me realize it&#039;s my kind of drug.

Huffing solvents is fucking stupid, dangerous and benzene in particular is carcinogenic!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=124267.msg854543#msg854543">Quote from: XTCandLSDHappyME on February 24, 2013, 12:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For anybody who says its not addictive your kidding yourself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t think cannabis is addictive at all. Yes sure, it is habitual but not addictive. Many people do have problems getting off it and have physical withdrawal symptoms but I don&#039;t. Maybe I just don&#039;t have a very addictive personality as I could easily stop smoking cigarettes at will when I still smoked. But I could feel how addictive tobacco was and it was a struggle. None of that with cannabis.<br /><br />I am a heavy cannabis smoker, around 6 joints every day. Whenever I go on a holiday ranging from a couple of days to a couple of weeks, I have no problem enjoying my holiday without smoking cannabis. To me, this indicates that cannabis is not addictive.

				Hrm, the only drug that I&#039;ve tried that I probably wouldn&#039;t do again is Klonopin(sp?), though my reason is rather silly I suppose. Was probably 19 when a friend gave me one, I popped it, drove over to another friends house, took 1 shot of whiskey, and then drove back to other friends house. Was so hard to keep my eyes open on that return drive, all I really remember is lying down and passing out. I&#039;ve snorted H once as well, and could do without more just fine. If offered, I&#039;d probably hit a bump or two, but opiates scare the shit out of me.

				I had a really aweful multi day experience where a vendor sent me 2c-p labeled as 2c-e. <br /><br />I went to town at 2c-e dosages. <br /><br />It ended with most of my friends having devil tails and me being chased around by guys in dark suits. <br /><br />Unfortunately, it turned me off of any further research with 2c-p<br />

				Salvia is high on my list. Weed too. I did salvia once, it still is the only bad trip I have ever had.<br /><br />Weed just doesn&#039;t agree with me. I don&#039;t mind the taste or the smell, but when I smoke it once I hit a peak high and things slow down, I can hear/feel my heart beating. Makes me super uncomortable, and I don&#039;t relax at all. Though, salvia I only did once. I do occasionally smoke to relieve back pain when I fell I&#039;m pushing it on my script, especially during the rainy months when shit gets real bad. (Moral of the story, don&#039;t break your back &gt;.&lt;).<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t fit into the &quot;again&quot; category, but I stay away from meth. I have a phobia of it stemming from too many examples in my maternal relatives for why to not do it.

				Never will I ever touch PCP again. Didn&#039;t intend to do it initially, had an absolutely awful experience along with both of the buddies I was with. And we were supposed to have a little fun with a bit of a coke session&nbsp; ::) lol. Anyways, has been hilarious reading some of these responses. Lesson learned that not every drug is for everyone. Use and share carefully.
