				&nbsp; &nbsp;I had two Items on S.R. that I really wanted and received one and am waiting on the other in the mail.&nbsp; I&#039;m left with 6.38 Btc, and have a nice tax return coming and when I get that I will probably put 1K into my S.R. account.&nbsp; So for the 420 holiday tomorrow I would like to be a nice guy and kick a coin or 2 down to who ever asks first.&nbsp; Doing something nice for someone can never be a bad idea in my mind.&nbsp; So anyone short a couple coins for an order or what ever, hit me up asap before their gone.<br />Peace
