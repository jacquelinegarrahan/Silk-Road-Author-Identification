				Hey there friends and colleagues on SR.&nbsp; Okay, so a couple months back I wanted to get into the Silk Road game myself and ordered the most massive shroom kit you can buy ;) lol.&nbsp; Did everything the way you&#039;re supposed to by the instructions, and maybe have come up with maybe 4 ounces of fresh shrooms- it says you are supposed to be able to grow pounds&nbsp; :-\ but I was happy to see anything happen, and I have tripped several times.&nbsp; When I dried some, they get very small and don&#039;t look impressive, not as much as when fresh.&nbsp; And they sure so lose weight too, for sale purposes.&nbsp; So mostly I have just been tripping by myself on them.&nbsp; The strain is Colorado, from RalphSpores, and the kit was the mega kit from Midwest Grow Kits (NEVER go through them, so ghetto, spend a few more bucks and go with Cali Grow Kits).&nbsp; So once I get a couple more flushes I am just going to put the whole thing away in my basement.&nbsp; It is possible that the strain was the problem, just not very potent, it&#039;s more or an emotional trip (even though they are clearly purple ringers and you can see the blue psilocybin) and especially now that I have LSD, it is just not cutting it...<br /><br />On growing the bud, I will try Cali Grow Kits I think, looks like for about $250 I can get something that will grow 4 plants in style, 8) that&#039;s what I&#039;m about lol.&nbsp; If not enough to sell (like the damn shrooms lol), at least I will be proud of myself and save a good amount of money on smoke...&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for the suggestions/comments guys.&nbsp; :)

				Im sorry your shrooms didn&#039;t work out. I loved growing my mushies&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I cant help but feel like a mushroom grow kit is quite an expensive way to go about doing it? People who I know who grow in bulk do so through making their own substrate jars and make dozens of them, which does yield ounces of dried shrooms. The kits always seem to claim more than they can deliver!<br />Good luck on the change to weed!

				Thanks bro!&nbsp; Yeah I will try it out.&nbsp; I am going to buy this kit- https://www.caligrowkits.com/ultra-hydroponic-kit.php- and 400 watts should really help me grow some dank ass buds... best of all it says it only adds $3 a month to your electric bill so no worries on the law either... going to try some Alien OG Kush or Purple Haze or Granddaddy Purple or something. :D

				If you&#039;re buying kits for growing anything you must have money to burn. Commercial shroom production will require liquid tek and bulk substrate in those set and leave tubs. A lot of effort now that LSD is a few clicks away but it could be profitable if you got the hang of it and it became an easy routine.

If the lamp was on 12hrs/day, it would consume 150kWh. I don&#039;t know how much you pay for 1 kWh but lets assume it was 10c -&gt; 15$/month not 3$. In reality the electricity bill will be even higher because the system hasn&#039;t 100% efficiency.

				Using grow kits is a very costly way of growing shrooms.<br /><br />If you want to bulk grow, do monotubs. <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve heard, weed growing is more work but is a lot less susceptible to fuck ups than shrooming.

				The grow kit you listed says it contains everything you need to grow, yet it fails to mention extractor fan and carbon filter.&nbsp; Airflow is the most important aspect of growing, and a good filter will stop you getting busted or robbed.<br /><br />Soil growing is easier to learn, more forgiving of mistakes, and cheaper on the initial equipment costs, so if you are on a budget consider putting your money towards good extraction, rather than hydro equipment.

				I think the kit is a great deal though, their $99 kit isn&#039;t worth the money, the $199 kit you could buy pieced out for less, but the $249 kit is a great deal, 400w HPS with 4-sided reflector would be $150+ alone plus it comes with a 2 year warranty.
