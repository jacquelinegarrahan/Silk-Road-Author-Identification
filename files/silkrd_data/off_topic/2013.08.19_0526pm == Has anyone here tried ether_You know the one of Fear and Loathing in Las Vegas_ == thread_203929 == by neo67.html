				some quotes from the film lol<br /><br />&#039;The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we&#039;d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. &#039;<br /><br />&#039;Ah, devil ether. It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel. Total loss of all basic motor function. Blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue. The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column. Which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can&#039;t control it.&#039;<br /><br />Just wondered if anyone has ever tried it?, doesn&#039;t seem available on here, anyone know where i can get it from?, i don&#039;t believe it is a controlled substance(correct me if i&#039;m wrong).<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve taken a whiff in my younger dumber years.&nbsp; It leaves you feeling quite strange light body hard to walk, talking like an idiot.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I did nearly anywhere near what they did in the movie.&nbsp; It did leave me with a splitting headache after I came down.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s a solvent you will find it used in organic chemistry.&nbsp; It can also be found in some starter fluids, but that needs to be seperated and vacuum distilled and I doubt I would do it even then.&nbsp;

				Jack is mostly VERY negative about Ether (no not petroleum ether), because he had some bad experiences with it which he wants to share&nbsp; everywhere.<br /><br />We sell that stuff now shut up jack. People can find out themselves how they react on it individually.<br /><br />What you sell can feel/be dangerous as well so spreading that has no use.

				Had a bottle of ether back in the day.<br /><br />Verdict: Pretty fun. Feels like a cross between alcohol and nitrous.

				Long ago a bottle of ether purloined from a University lab was making it&#039;s late night rounds of the regular after-hours student flat, full of people. Guy a couple away from me took a big huff and fell over on the floor, drool coming out of his mouth. My friend, who lived there, pointed at him and said &quot;that&#039;s our landlord&quot;.<br /><br />Even then, I think I might have tried, but I certainly didn&#039;t enjoy enough to try again.

				Why would we say we sell it and then don&#039;t?<br /><br />We just need to adjust our listing for it.

				Wont find it anyway?<br /><br />Virmo sells diethyl ether (you do not want the other ether).<br /><br />Smoking around it can be done. Fire needs to be pretty close to cause fire.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m wondering... it can be used as a solvent in very low amounts to wash speed/coke?

				I thought they just used the ether in the movie to appear drunk, so as to mask the fact that they were starting to trip balls on the mescaline.
