				So my girlfriend and i are pretty serious these days, been going out for a good few years been on holidays etc , But she has always been so damn messy! Im more of a Put things where they belong type guy, everything has a place and that&#039;s the way i like it. <br />she is the opposite, messy, just plain messy, gets things out and doesn&#039;t put them away, let&#039;s stuff accumulate into one big ass pile and mess etc.<br />Anyway when i tell her to clean it up i either get &quot; Stop bloody moaning&quot; Or why dont you clean it up, I always clean up your mess&quot; Now i rarely make any mess and i would not have to moan if she cleaned up after herself. She always has to make me out to be the bad guy even if she&#039;s in the wrong. <br /><br />No idea how the hell i can make her be tidy, i have tried sitting down and having a decent discussion with her, she is actual very fair about it all, Says fine no problem etc, but goes back to being messy soon after, I dont know if it&#039;s intentional or not, i doubt it is, I personally think she has always been this way and nobody has ever moaned at her about it when she was younger so she got used to it and thinks it&#039;s okay.<br /><br />Now no suggestions like &quot; spike her with speed, that&#039;l make her clean up&quot; As funny as they are, Im really looking for some advice here. if i have learned anything it&#039;s that on the road, SOMEONE will be in the same situation. <br /><br />Peace all :)&nbsp; :)

				I hear that. I love my lady and consider her a best friend, but I&#039;m afraid to move in with her because I don&#039;t want my badgering about tidiness to ruin our relationship. My own room is not the world&#039;s neatest, but the rest of my place - all the &#039;public areas&#039; - are clean all the time. I don&#039;t mind a bit of clutter or clothe piles, but will gag in the prolonged presence of heaps of dishes, filthy sinks, sticky floors. I cannot be comfortable in unsanitary environments. <br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about the precedents I would have to set before ever moving in together- No dishes left in the sink overnight, biweekly massive top-to-bottoms (vacuuming, mopping, etc) and cleaning up messes the minute they occur would all have to be agreed upon.

What is the fucking logic there? is it so hard to stand up for a second and bin it? i have made a point of not clearing the shit up and telling her to clean her own mess up now, but half the fucking time it doesn&#039;t, she will leave it until it&#039;s unbearable and then do a massive full clean of the room until it is spotless, and then fuck it all up again.<br /><br />It&#039;s really starting to piss me off... but i&nbsp; wouldn&#039;t want to end a relationship that is otherwise mostly good just because of this ,however i wonder when the cut off point will be as it gets pretty stressful. <br /><br />if i could give you one bit of advice it would be this. Set the ground rules out beforehand, make sure the consequences are plain and clear before you move in together. otherwise it will just develop and develop.

You know women shit. <br />ahh to think of the joy lol, She already lives with me. been this way for some time now.

				You have to love the person for who they are, If she is messy and you need your partner to be clean four options... you can change to accept living in filth, she can change and pull her weight around the house more, you could find a more compatible house mate, or you could both chip in to employ a cleaner. I found telling her to think of housework as exercise didn&#039;t go down so well... lol :)<br />I found my place in the &quot;classic&quot; family role where the man earns the big bucks and the woman maintains the home/kids/chores/herself so he can earn them bucks. <br />Good luck, I hope you work it out!

Dose the bitch&nbsp; with a huge amount, dont fuck around here, I´m talking like those huge ass 50ml syringes. Do it whilst shes asleep. Sneak out out the room and go put on your giant garbage costume, that is a costume consisting of a trash can body, black rubbish sack trousers, dead trouts and stuff glued on everywhere. make it really fucking disgusting. <br />Then grab your taser count to 3, perhaps do a quick hit of crystal meth. Bust in the door, making sure to wake the bitch up as violently as possible. taser her a few times whilst laughing manically. blind fold her and dump her, terrorised, in the boot of your car, for good effect throw a couple of trash bags in with her, the really smelly ones. Drive out to an industrial dumping ground and drag her out of the car. Taze her some more and tell her this is where she belongs in a deep dramatic voice. make sure she dosent spot your car and dance off manically. <br />After 36 terroriffic hours of her begging to god for salvation and digging her way though other peoples disused condoms and diapers she should be just starting to come down. when she works out how to communicate with people again or use a payphone she should hopefully work her way home or call you for a lift. You should find some fundamental changes have taken place in her head. Of which cleanliness will be high up there at the top. <br /><br />I hope this helps.

				MY girlfriend and I tend to co-exist on every level. If I&#039;m being a slob, she&#039;ll be one too. If I&#039;m cleaning the house every day, so is she. If I cook, she helps. If she cooks, I help. We wash dishes together(even tho we have a dishwasher), etc etc.<br /><br />Point is, it&#039;s never one persons job. It&#039;s a joint effort... the moment you start using the words &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; instead of always saying &quot;you&quot; or &quot;me&quot; ... that&#039;s when things will start getting cleaned up to your liking. Compromise is not about another person abiding by your rules or ideas... compromise is about sharing rules and ideas.<br /><br />Can&#039;t say that I&#039;ve ever fought with my GF. We&#039;ve been together 4 years, and in the time, we&#039;ve slept with 20+ women, together.<br /><br />I honestly wonder when society is going to wake up, and start spreading the message that we truly ARE equal... if we allow ourselves to be!

They´re aliens. Their only fucking mission in life is to get pregnant and its all a sham up till then, all the dick sucking and massages and liking horror films and gaming. Its all a fucking LIE just to get some of that milky jizz. Once its theirs they drop the sherade and become lazy, fast food eating, weight accumulating a-sexual, midgets. <br />The key to a successful life is to lead as many on up to the point where it becomes the choice of giving them your sperm or getting dumped, to which point you ALWAYS chose the latter. <br /><br />Healthy living tip 2 by Ace

				fuckingACE, why did I ever go to school? I could have just come to you for everything. Damn. I wasted 12 years of my life. From now on, you&#039;re my only source of learning, advice, and directing questions to. <br /><br />OP, yes, I have the same issue. She&#039;ll prance around in public acting all clean and shit but go into her room and you want to walk right back out haha. It&#039;s the same thing with her car.

				i guess im lucky. my girl has ocd so shes always cleaning. she takes my dish before im done eating and puts it in the dishwasher. she takes my glass to the kitchen from the bedroom with half a glass of iced tea left in it which i would definitly drink the next night since its still half full. shes like the human vacuume cleaning up everything right behind me. i could walk in the house leave a trail of clothes going to the bathroom and before i come out of there they will all be picked up and put away. sometimes it could be annoying like when im not done eating and my plate is gone but&nbsp; for the&nbsp; most part its nice not having to lift a finger oh and she makes the bed every morning i mean in this day and age who the fuck still makes the bed every morning??
