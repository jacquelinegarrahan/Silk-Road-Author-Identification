				Yeah, demand for 2C-B is significantly higher than 2C-E, so you see that reflected in the prices. 2C-E is a very.... unique drug. Don&#039;t know if OP has ever tried it, but it is an interesting phenethylamine.

				2c-e stayed legal for a longer period of time then 2c-b.<br />the demand for 2c-e was bigger due to its legality and as such with supply n demand the price was lower, with 2c-b it was only a select few who could obtain it or had the balls to retail it. Look at the nombe&#039;s, once 2c-e was banned they blew up. <br /><br />Also many of the wholesale vendors who are pumping out 2c-x&#039;s do not stock 2c-b or at least offer it to the public at large so supply cost could be a factor, that theory is coming out my ass but seems logical enough.
