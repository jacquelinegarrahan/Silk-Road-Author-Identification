				This guy comes into a bar, walks up to the bartender. Says, &quot;Bartender, I got me a bet for you. I&#039;m gonna bet you $300 that I can piss into that glass over there and not spill a single, solitary drop.&quot; The bartender looks. I mean, we&#039;re talking, like, this glass is like a good ten feet away. He says, &quot;Now wait, let me get this straight. You&#039;re tryin&#039; to tell me you&#039;ll bet me $300 that you can piss, standing over here, way over there into that glass, and not spill a single drop?&quot; Customer looks up and says, &quot;That&#039;s right.&quot; Bartender says, &quot;Young man, you got a bet.&quot; The guy goes, &quot;Okay, here we go. Here we go.&quot; Pulls out his thing. He&#039;s lookin&#039; at the glass, man. He&#039;s thinkin&#039; about the glass. He&#039;s thinkin&#039; about the glass. Glass. He&#039;s thinkin&#039; about the glass, glass. Thinkin&#039; about his dick. Dick, glass, dick, glass, dick, glass, dick, glass, dick, glass, dick, glass, dick, glass. And then he lets it rip. And he pisses all over the place, man. He&#039;s pissin&#039; on the bar. He pissin&#039; on the stools, on the floor, on the phone, on the bartender! He&#039;s pissing everywhere *except* the fucking glass! Right? Okay. So, bartender, he&#039;s laughing his fuckin&#039; ass off. He&#039;s $300 richer. He&#039;s like, &quot;Ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; Piss dripping off his face. &quot;Ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; He says, &quot;You fucking idiot, man! You got it in everything except the glass! You owe me $300 punta.&quot; Guy goes, &quot;Excuse me just one-one little second.&quot; Goes in the back of the bar. In back, there&#039;s a couple of guys playing pool. He walks over to them. Comes back to the bar. Goes, &quot;Here you go, Mr. Bartender, $300.&quot; And the bartender&#039;s like, &quot;What the fuck are you so happy about? You just lost $300, idiot!&quot; The guy says, &quot;Well, see those guys over there? I just bet them $500 apiece that I could piss on your bar, piss on your floor, piss on your phone, and piss on you, and not only would you not be mad about it, you&#039;d be happy!
