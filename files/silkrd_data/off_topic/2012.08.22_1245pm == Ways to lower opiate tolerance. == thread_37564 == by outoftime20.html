				I&#039;m currently taking proglumide to lower opiate tolerance. What else can I do to potentate opoids or to lower my tolerance further? Even with proglumide an oxy 80 cant touch me, I only use opiates on the weekends.

				I have a friend who abused the hell out of opiates. He&#039;s gotta take probably 6-10 times the amount I do to get a similar feel. He&#039;s never been able to get his tolerance back down. <br /><br />Not saying it isn&#039;t possible, but if you figure it out please let me know because I haven&#039;t seen it done.<br /><br />Good luck

				My tolerance came way down in rehab. You could try that. Exercise and time off opioids seems to help.

				I was on 180mg oxy a day for 3+ years. Detoxed 3 years this month.&nbsp; Was opiate free until 4 weeks ago - got a 30mg and banged it for old times.&nbsp; It was just a tickle... But I don&#039;t know if my resistance is related to all opiates or just oxy.&nbsp; What I won&#039;t do is keep pushing the mg amount and daily use.&nbsp; Afraid that would wipe out what tolerance I do have back.

				I didn&#039;t see that you said how you are using. If you are just swallowing the pills then start snorting them. If you are just snorting them then, well... ya know do something a little more mainline :) <br /><br />But if you have already reached that point then, as much as it sucks, time is the only thing that really works.<br /><br />What happens when you develop a tolerance to opiates is your opiate receptors start to multiply as your usage grows so that the number of receptors you have now is wayyy more than when you first started. Overtime they&#039;ll disappear when you cease using.

				i think you got that backwards,&nbsp; due the excessive activation of the mu receptor by opioids, the number of the receptors actually goes down. you need more drug to produce the same level of signal. eventually you have too few receptors to even produce the signal needed to produce a high... <br /><br />then when the constantly high levels of activation are removed because you cant get your fix, you have too few receptors for your brains natural activation to produce a normal signal strength.... which leads to withdrawal. eventually over time your body responds to the low signal and produces more receptors and your tolerance will decrease. you may never actually get back the number you started with, and could always retain a slight decrease in your potential high you can attain depending on the individual <br /><br />there are some good threads on potentiation if you use the search. this page also has a list of potentiators: http://opioids.com/opiates/index.html<br />for tolerance - some have reported dxm to have potential effects related to lowering tolerance or preventing it from building as quickly. some report not noticing, but may be worth looking into more

				OK I&#039;ve got the ultimate setup. 9 pills containing 7.5 mg hydro in each. but theres shitty acetaminophen, so ill have to swallow? i was considering cold water extraction any thoughts? I&#039;m taking 800mg proglumide every day and got white grapefruit juice and dramamine. If this doesnt fuck me up nothing will other than slamming<br />.

				As far as poisoning goes you&#039;re probably ok with eating 9. Assuming they have 500mg apap in each that&#039;s only a little over the recommended daily limit of 4,000mg. Unless you&#039;ve had more acetaminophen/tylenol today already. But a CWE wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea.<br /><br />And I don&#039;t know if this is what you referring to, but please don&#039;t slam hydro. At least not codone. morphone is ok :)

				came across a couple interesting articles today about the potential of some common anti-psychotics in order to decrease opioid tolerance. they target a protein kinase, CamKII, so evidently work differently than proglumide and may be helpful as well.&nbsp; evidently trifluoperazine and haloperidol are potentials according to: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16380209 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436292<br /><br />my tolerance sucks, and just keeps going up. the amounts im doing now would have killed me initially... i stare at the pile of powder and am astonished to think how little I used to need. <br /><br />have you actually noticed a difference with proglumide?&nbsp; <br /><br />if you are taking APAP frequently I would recommend a CWE, since its really not that difficult and think it wise not to take shortcuts when related to your health. you should check out that link i posted in my first post about the potientiators. it mentions CWE and also that if you are using grapefruit juice (which will decrease metabolism and prolong high) do so at least 45 min before dosing and then take some Tums before swallowing (higher BA than snorting) to NEUTRALIZE THE ACID because they are best absorbed in a higher pH environment

Last time I tried a CWE it didnt seem to turn out that well. I will probably take them all at once. The proglumide HAS helped but slowly. Before, I couldt barely even feel an oxy 80. After 5 days on proglumide, 5 7.5mg hydro pills had me nodding really nicely - but the high felt a little more aesthetic, noticeably different but not in a bad way. Dramamine seems to have this effect as well, except it increases nodding and makes me tired. <br /><br />The problem with proglumide is tolerance builds up in a week, so you can only use it in cycles. Because I&#039;m a desperate junkie, I&#039;ve simply increased my dose to 4 times what it used to be to combat the tolerance. I&#039;m going to go down to 600mg because the 800mg is giving me an upset stomach and diahrea.<br /><br />Another question, how long did it take you guys to build tolerance? I got prescribed 30mg oxys and by the time it was over my tolerance was fucked, vicodin and percocet didnt really do much. I dont know how anyone is able to be a junkie for more than a month without being rich or something? I guess IV&#039;ing would make things more affordable but still.
