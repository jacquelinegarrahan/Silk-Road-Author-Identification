				Would somebody explain these to me, who has some experience.&nbsp; Bluntly: can you &#039;fix&#039; them, or are they &#039;messy?&#039;&nbsp; A new seller just put them up.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done opana, and was curious.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought I had gotten something that was opana: had a bunch of little &#039;bead&#039;s&#039; inside, you had to crush up.&nbsp; &#039;Rush&#039; but no legs at all...I was told that was something else...anybody have experience with these 20mg pills?

				Opana is oxymorphone. Opana 20mg ER has whats called TimerX in it to help avoid abuse. If snorted, it almost totally bypasses the timerx system. This is why Endo just got approved for the tamper resistant formula for opana Er. you will see these hit the pharmacies in about 4-6 months. They will probably be like the oxycontin op&#039;s.<br /><br />Go over to opiophile and look an synacks method of bypassing the timerx for shooting. The main difference in the 20mg and the 40mg is that they are about the same size but the 20mg has a lot more fillers. But its fairly easy to bypass the timerX system if you want to shoot.<br /><br />If you like dilaudid, you will love oxymorphone. oxymorphone has much more legs and more euphoric. Plus,&nbsp; a 20mg or a 40mg Er will be much more than a D8 in equivalency, i mean much more..<br /><br />IF you snort them, all you have to do is use a closehamp and grind it down, its very easy. then snort away. If you add water, it will gel up, hence check out the way to defeat it on opiophile...<br /><br />But to answer your question, YES you can fix them. It just takes a little bit of work...<br /><br />The approximate equivalency is 8mg of diliaudid is equal to 5.33mg of oxymorphone IV. so theoretically speaking a 20mg of opana is equivalent to about 32mg of dilaudid. So, you get more bang for your buck with opana....

				Yeah: the guy is already gone anyway: must&#039;ve only had a few to sell.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lately, there has been more H and &#039;D&#039;s but I&#039;m starting to realize just how much the daily mdone blocks them...I think I knew it, but was pretending/hoping it wouldn&#039;t...and I have trouble waiting long enough--2 to 3 days, for me--to start getting sick, so I&#039;d feel them.&nbsp; Have to take stock, or I&quot;m spending money ridiculously and not feeling shit...many times in my life I&quot;ve known heroin addicts on high dose methadone do the same thing: try to do H before mdone was out of there system, and they didn&#039;t feel shit...but you can overdose trying to get that rush, so it can be dangerous...fucking dope :(

				I just got some Opana 10mg tonight (not from here), they are pink pills with 10 on one side and E795 on the other. You can crush them and snort them, no problem. I say a 10mg is the equivalent to a roxi 30 (great since i paid $6 a piece for them). Im not sure about the higher mg dosage though, the highest ive had was 10mg - and yes, its Oxymorphone hydrochloride.
