With mushrooms you can either have the best trip ever, or the nightmare from hell.

				Nice wild cubies! They have some very pretty blue for wild cubes too. I just can&#039;t get past the larvae, ick. If you get them before the caps open they are usually worm free though..<br /><br />Not trying to downplay the importance of knowing EXACTLY, without any doubt, what you&#039;re picking, but... While there are a couple poisonous mushrooms that bruise blue, you most certainly will not find them growing from manure, especially middle of summer in the deep south.<br /><br />If you are finding dirty blonde to dark brown mushrooms with white stems, a veil or remnants (ring on the stem), that bruise blue, and have purple/black spores, on manure (pretty much anywhere and everywhere in an established pasture) they are cubes.<br /><br />If they lack the veil, and have scaly stems, but share the other characteristics they are some type of panaeolus. Some are active, some are not, but none are going to hurt you.<br /><br />
