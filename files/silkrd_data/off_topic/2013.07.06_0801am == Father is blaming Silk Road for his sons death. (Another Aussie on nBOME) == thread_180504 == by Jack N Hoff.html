				What is it with Australians, nBOMEs and balconies? ???<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Synthetic LSD and an online &quot;eBay for drugs&quot; known as the Silk Road have been linked to the death of popular Churchlands student Preston Bridge.<br /><br />Preston&#039;s family yesterday released confronting images of the 16-year-old in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in the days before he died.<br /><br />They spoke out after receiving an update on the coronial investigation into his death, which was the result of catastrophic head injuries after Preston fell from a balcony at Scarborough&#039;s Sunmoon Resort on February 16.<br /><br />The toxicology tests found only a small trace of cannabis in Preston&#039;s system but no sign of LSD. Preston&#039;s father Rod Bridge told The Weekend West that five of the eight teenagers who were at the resort took what they believed to be LSD.<br /><br />Mr Bridge said the lack of any trace of LSD in his son&#039;s system led to speculation Preston may have instead taken a synthetic version of the drug that was not immediately recognisable as a form of LSD.<br /><br />Synthetic drugs are growing in popularity across the world because they are seen as a way to bypass laws and regarded as a safer alternative to substances made in illegal backyard laboratories.<br /><br />They are outlawed in WA under laws regarded as among the tightest in Australia.<br /><br />Mr Bridge said he was angry at the person who supplied the drugs to Preston. No charges have been laid and police inquiries into the supply of the drugs are continuing.<br /><br />Mr Bridge is also angry at the operators of the Silk Road, which employs high-technology security measures to mask users&#039; true identities and uses a digital currency that eliminates the involvement of banks.<br /><br />&quot;You get told by people that you can&#039;t shut down Silk Road,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;I can&#039;t accept that. How can you not shut down the Silk Road drug site but put a man on the Moon? How can you not stop a website - it&#039;s ridiculous. Preston is not the first to die and won&#039;t be the last.&quot;<br /><br />The Bridge family have different views on the responsibility of the teenager who took the drugs to the resort.<br /><br />Mr Bridge said his former wife Vicki and daughter Aimee believed Preston was ultimately responsible because he took the drugs.<br /><br />Preston&#039;s case bears striking similarities to the death of Henry Kwan, who died after falling from the balcony of his family&#039;s north Sydney home on June 5.<br /><br />Toxicology is yet to confirm exactly what the 17-year-old took but senior NSW police said his behaviour before his death appeared similar to that shown by others who had ingested 25B-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe.<br />The drugs are known by the street names of N-Bomb, Smiles and 25I. Up to 400 Smiles tablets were seized in regional WA in September.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/17887955/drug-warning-for-teens/

I&#039;m sorry but even if they managed to somehow shut down SR, its not going to stop people from dealing and buying. Demand for drugs isn&#039;t going to stop just like that, what if he couldn&#039;t access SR and ended up taking LSD bought from a local dealer and still fell off the balcony? or maybe ended up mixing drugs like Meth, alcohol, Ketamine and whatever other shit? would he begin blaming dealers?<br /><br />Holy shit his father is so fucking stupid.

				What I&#039;d like to know is just how much these people have been taking.&nbsp; Most drugs are safe when taken at appropriate dosages, I&#039;d assume nBOMEs are the same but these reports haven&#039;t given much insight.

				&quot;Preston is not the first to die and won&#039;t be the last.&quot; - Just because some idiots take too much or are irresponsible, it&#039;s called for to ban things? Might want to start banning fast-food and candy to combat the obesity epidemic that are causing deaths then. Dem ar teh real druugz!

				It doesn&#039;t say how they know the product was even ordered off SR. I mean it&#039;s not like getting a package from Amazon or something where it&#039;s obvious. Unless the father knew the son had an SR account, which is highly unlikely, maybe they&#039;re just assuming it was off SR.

				Clearly SR is not to blame for this kid&#039;s death, but let&#039;s all take a step-back.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s the net and everything, but an actual person has died... to call a naive child a &#039;dumbass&#039; or an &#039;idiot&#039; for doing something that tragically led to his death is pretty low.<br /><br />It&#039;s a sad incident, but it&#039;s not reflective upon SR, or the majority of responsible drug users. <br />But again he&#039;s a kid and now he&#039;s dead. Let&#039;s not blame him for the media&#039;s use of this story to further damage SR&#039;s reputation.

				The kid might have been naive, but I feel like I would be disrespectful in saying he was a dumbass.<br />He could have been going through some serious mental issues, mixed with drugs could have been just the tipping point he needed to jump.<br /><br />Or maybe he got fucked up with his girl, and she fucked someone else..

				The nbomes series dont have shit to do on this brothers, i mean, look at the freakin amount that is being dealt everyday everywhere, i mean, its MASSIVE as hell, and how many &quot;deaths&quot; uve heard off? i mean, REALLY DIE FROM THE SUBSTANCE, not for being 2 high and fell off a balcony or through acid into his eyes, i mean, cmmon, dont be such an asshole and open your eyes, Tobacco is worst, and is fuckin legal, and that dont even kill themselves as smokers, kill us worst as passives, and so what? that is still around and nobody complains on that. The nbomes are great psychedelics, period, as all drugs, people must be aware of what they take, and even if they get &quot;fooled&quot; and sold as &quot;LSD&quot;, cmon, u can jump off a balcony on LSD too, lol.

That would have solved the problem before it became one. They would&#039;ve swallowed their tabs like most people do when consuming LSD (and if you don&#039;t I suggest you do now there&#039;s so many bucally active dosed blottered), nothing would&#039;ve happened and he probably would not be dead.<br /><br />I think this is Darwinism at its finest - sit back and watch the show.
