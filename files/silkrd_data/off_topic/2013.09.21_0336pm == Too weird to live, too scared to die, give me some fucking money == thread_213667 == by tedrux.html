				I don&#039;t often visit /offtopic,&nbsp; but everytime I do I see you begging for money :$<br /><br />If you really need money do commit suicide, why don&#039;t you get a credit card or use paydayloan or something, not like you&#039;re gonna pay it back...

				This is one example of how the internet gives people a platform and an impulse to talk shite that nobody in real life could care less about. Its not real, its attention seeking behavior because of your lack of it.<br /><br />Go out and get some friends, relate with people and try not be the center of attention, then you&#039;ll stop being weird :)

				Yeah you didn&#039;t have to keep that promise, Murderface, and as he won&#039;t have the decency to return that coin to you, knowing you have kids to feed and no place to lay your head at night I&#039;m done with these threads now. I&#039;ve said everything I can possibly say and I know we&#039;ll still be seeing these tragic little threads this time next year, even if the fucking head of Dignitas in Switzerland offered to fly to Ted&#039;s bedside and put him down personally, he&#039;d find a way to wriggle out of it.<br /><br />The fantasy of suicide and imagining people he&#039;s harmed forgiving him in death is more alluring to him than just doing it in my opinion.

				<br />thank you Remidiless and samesame!!<br />I&#039;ve strived to be nothing but honest, patient, and open minded through my time here..<br />and I&#039;ll admit, my patience and open mind have been put through multiple &#039;tests&#039;..<br />you teddy, are one of these &#039;tests&#039;.. and you put my thoughts in conflict!!<br /><br />if such influential entities as samesame are conveying me to reconsider keeping my word owing to the circumstances at hand, we&#039;ll cross that bridge when my coin arrives..<br /><br />im sorry teddy (and i don&#039;t know why), but you may become the first name on my ignore list..<br /><br />but I&#039;ll leave you with this..<br />whatever you decide to do, or not to do.. has already been predetermined by all of your life&#039;s experiences, external influences, and evolved train of thought.. you and i truly don&#039;t matter.. but the part we play in the &#039;whole&#039; of humanity, is beyond essential!! whatever your &#039;outcome&#039;, it is/was to benefit everyone on earth by keeping a balance..<br />just do whatever it is you&#039;re going to, please!!
