				It depends on your set of morals! I see hallucinogens especially as more of view changers / mind expanding rather than drugs.....<br /><br />A personal buddy of mine went through college as a 4.0 student and a full time heroin addict. Just because you might do something &quot;morally wrong&quot; doesn&#039;t make you a bad person. <br /><br />You make what you want out of yourself. If you&#039;re successful, then so be it! If you aren&#039;t blame yourself, not the drugs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Take a chance to read Steve Jobs&#039; biography. He noted himself he would&#039;ve never been as successful as he became without LSD.

				Some of the most intelligent, deep thinkers I&#039;ve ever met were heavy drug users... sometimes in ways I&#039;d never dream.&nbsp; Everyone needs a different balance and they were still functional, pulling great grades and more often than not, using the drugs to better themselves.<br /><br />You are the only person that can answer this question.&nbsp; Be safe, be responsible, don&#039;t lose yourself.

				Drugs are not inherently bad. It&#039;s how you handle the responsibility of what&#039;s around you that defines who you are - not any simple substance. <br /><br />Only you can decide if using would affect you in some moral way: would you go overboard and jeopardize a surgery, and therefore someone else&#039;s life? I&#039;d say that was wrong. But if you&#039;ve got a good head on your shoulders, what makes a shot of heroin any different from a cold beer, or driving your car too fast on the highway?

				The question is really what do you feel? Are you happy with you choices and actions. They are a rather compendious way of exemplifying your personality, so when reflecting upon these thing, do you feel proud? <br /><br />Personal I find that our consciousness is what allows us to perceive, but it is viewed through the ego (our personality, our wants, hopes, outlook, memories), and through this lens we see / experience our own personal reality. The dissolution of this reality through experience not limited and bound by normal sensory perception and the lens of the ego lends to an experience that is transcendental, allows us a comparison by which to judge our self, helps to understand thing in a way not so attached to our personal reality. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Morally wrong?<br />You weren&#039;t raised as a catholic btw?<br /><br />The concept of &quot;guilt&quot; was exploited by many religions, hence the question.<br />Your true &quot;self&quot; already knows the answer to this question (if you can free yourself from any previously imprinted &quot;moral standards&quot;).<br />It&#039;s quite obvious what things are morally wrong: exploiting people, killing (innocent) people, etc.<br />IMO, everybody knows these things by heart.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see why trying to expand your consciousness could be morally wrong in any way. Especially for the exact scientist you hope to become one day.<br />It&#039;s not our rules and laws that dictate morality. It is your heart.

				While it is illegal, I don&#039;t think using drugs is morally wrong at all. We&#039;re told drugs are illegal because they&#039;re &quot;dangerous&quot; because they will &quot;kill you or make you so crazy that you kill someone else&quot;. I don&#039;t think drinking alcohol is morally wrong, do you? Alcohol can kill you, alcohol can make you act upon things without thinking about them first, just like some drugs. Is smoking cigarettes morally wrong? Cigarettes can kill you, and they&#039;re highly addictive. I don&#039;t understand why it is considered by many people to be morally wrong to sit in your own house and smoke meth because you&#039;re addicted, but to sit in your own house and smoke cigarettes because you&#039;re addicted is totally different &amp; justifiable. I just don&#039;t see the difference.<br /><br />Just because the government tells you you should be ashamed of yourself &amp; you&#039;re a bad person for doing something doesn&#039;t mean you should/are. I say go ahead and be the best damn surgeon you can be.

				As far as using psychedelics as a surgeon go, I say you will be fine.&nbsp; The key thing is keeping your private LSD-usage out of the professional work place.&nbsp; You by all means can think about, but don&#039;t bring it up in conversation at work or in a professional setting like in a discussion with a professor.&nbsp; You can get into some sticky situations if you do.<br /><br />Now OUTSIDE the work place and professional world, i would say the exact opposite.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your friends can&#039;t accept that you safely use psychedelics, and will actually look down on you for that, then those are probably people you don&#039;t want to be friends with.<br /><br />
