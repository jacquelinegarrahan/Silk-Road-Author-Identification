				I can provide proof of sales if needed.<br /><br />The product price is $99.<br />There is absolutely no competition for this product.<br />The contents of this product is easily worth over 1k.<br />The site is integrated with PayPal and is a registered business in Australia.<br />I have over 10 positive reviews on the product. Never had a complaint.<br />It is all streamlined, there is very little customer service, most people see the site and buy without contacting me.<br />I have promoted my product on a small scale and made a 2k+ in about a month. To do this I contacted 2k of the target market with my pitch email, 20 of them bought the product. I probably could have sold more but I had no idea on how to avoid spam detection. Now I do.<br /><br />Unfortunately I blew all my money so I&#039;m a bit stuck so I&#039;m looking for financial help.<br /><br />I know a way that we can contact 50k+ leads. Potentially making 50k. It will involve email harvesting which is completely blackhat but it works and in no way can it be traced back to my business as the business and product is 100% legit.<br /><br />If you&#039;re interested please let me know so I can supply more info and show you the website/product.
