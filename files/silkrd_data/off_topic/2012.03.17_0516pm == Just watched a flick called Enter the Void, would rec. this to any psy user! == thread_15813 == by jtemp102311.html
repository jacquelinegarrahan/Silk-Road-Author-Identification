				I have it on the &quot;to watch&quot; list. I&#039;ll suggest a show called &quot;botany of desire.&quot; It&#039;s about plants and how they&#039;ve basically made humans their slaves so they can prosper. It profiles apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes. Totally mind blowing especially the tulips.&nbsp; Several hundred years ago they were so highly prized people were spending 15 million on a single bulb. The value of tulips over reached all the money in the country. Overnight the bubble burst. Insane stuff

				idk maybe my expectations were just too high from what i had heard about it. i thought it was a good film but not like everyone was raving. its on netflix instant if anyones interested<br /><br />i definitely enjoyed the first ten or fifteen minutes, with the whole dmt experience and the distinctive style of filming, but eventually it got kinda draining. <br /><br />also was kinda uncomfortable cause when I watch a movie generally i dont expect it to be on the verge of a creepy adult film... i was just wondering when is this going to end<br /><br />overall though at the end i did appreciation the story as it came together, and the philosophies represented in the film were certainly interesting and unusual perspective<br />

And the brother and sister borderline incest thing was kinda creepy.<br /><br /><br />Feb<br />
