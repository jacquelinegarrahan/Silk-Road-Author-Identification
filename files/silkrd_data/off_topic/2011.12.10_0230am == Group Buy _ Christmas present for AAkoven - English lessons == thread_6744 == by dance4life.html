				As much as I love AAkoven&#039;s broken English it would be nice to be able to understand everything he is saying.&nbsp; I think we owe that much to him at least.<br /><br />Or we could just get like RosettaStone off of btjunkie and tell him we spent bundles of coin on his Christmas present..&nbsp; It is the thought that counts, right?<br /><br /><br />.. and yeah I&#039;m a tad zooted-up currently.. so what? wanna fight?<br /><br />:)

				Don&#039;t get him English lessons! I love reading PM&#039;s from AA, he is so chilled and funny as anything... How about we all just buy a shit load of MDMA from him instead? I&#039;m sure that would make him happy for the holiday season&nbsp; :D

				Hey now, steady on!&nbsp; Americans and Australians can&#039;t even speak &#039;proper&#039; English!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Even Nigerian illegal immigrants hustling on the streets of Europe can speak 3-5 languages..<br /><br />We need to get some dutch lessons.... It helps if you need to clear your throat all the time.<br />

				Considering it&#039;s not his first language I think he does a great job of communicating. I have nothing but respect for someone who can speak English as a second language as apparently it&#039;s one of the harder languages to learn.
