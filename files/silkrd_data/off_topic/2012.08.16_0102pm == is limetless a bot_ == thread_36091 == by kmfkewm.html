				Oh yeah I am the first one to admit I post a lot, I am just a highly social creature. :) I like posting on SR because it gives you an avenue to talk about things openly without fear or reprisal from the bobbies. IRL everything has to be stealth-shit so for me this forum is a breath of fresh air away from the paranoia. It&#039;s good for the soul. :)

				of course he&#039;s a bot, what else could he be. I heard it runs on coke, 200 posts per gram. <br /><br />I am a bot too, but a different version, I run on speed &amp; lsd and I am used for PR purposes. Those who fill me up with the best drugs will get the best PR.

				There is another forum up on the .ONION network that mirrors these threads.&nbsp; When you create a thread here, a copy is created on the other forum and when somebody replies, the reply is copied to the other forum.&nbsp; There are like 10 users on that other forum and they all post and then vote on their posts.&nbsp; The bot picks up either the highest voted or lowest voted and repost it on these forums using the account Limetless.&nbsp; The bot chooses a disparity between the lowbrow posts and insightful posts to make it seem like Limetless is a real person.<br /><br />True story.

				Yeah I mean I do do a fair amount of Blow but not like, 24/7. I mean shit, if I did I&#039;d never get anything done on here lol. Like I said I am just a bit of a social creature and the SR forum gives me an outlet I just don&#039;t have IRL so SR doesn&#039;t just earn me what ya might call a fat lump of cheddar it also keeps my sanity in check as well.

				This is getting fucking boring now. For those that took the piss out of this thread then well done and props to you for rolling your eyes at this bullshit. For those that feel the need to speculate on whether I am actually a real person or whether I am two people, a zebra, a clone or your next door neighbor then you really need to get a fucking life and spend your time speculating on more interesting things. I would have thought that 400+ sales would confirm I wasn&#039;t simply a computer program but there ya go. <br /><br />Fuck my arse, the ridiculousness of it all is bizarre. Why people need to speculate on things like myself being coding, Pine being a woman or not, how much vendors earn, how much DPR earns or whether or not DPR knows the Mods or Admins he employs personally is completely beyond me. Lives are needed, along with probably sex on a more frequent basis or sex at all in some cases.
