				www.iptorrents.me <br /><br />don&#039;t listen to people recommending private trackers. They are slow, not to mention monitored by LE.

				Both these are pretty good:<br /><br />The Pirate Bay (famous) - http://thepiratebay.se/<br /><br />Demonoid - http://www.demonoid.ph/<br /><br />Demonoid is better for more obscure software or releases which Pirate Bay won&#039;t list.<br /><br />Make sure you order search results by &#039;Seeders&#039; as the more seeders = more people giving you = faster download.

				My favorites is KAT.ph (google kick Ass torrents, you&#039;ll find it...)&nbsp; I liked demanoid, but just doesn&#039;t seem as slick...I use tixati as my torrent app...<br /><br />I&#039;m going thru a bunch of head twisting lately, trying to hide torrent play....but not to slow it down...so naturally TOR is out, but here I am with *two* things I kind of want to keep quiet about with the authorities, you know, it would be all fucked to get nailed for copywright theft or some such BS and then they look around ....<br /><br />But torrents are are interesting/fun way to get your movies and shows and shit....but also can complicate a bit a man&#039;s setup...that makes something like 4 OR&#039;s I have, win7 on laptop, mac mini w/apple, linux (tails), chrome(chromeos ha ha).....but since I like tixati so much, I&#039;m a bit stumped because I just got the mini, and apple don&#039;t run tixati, and I don&#039;t want to run a vm just to get my torrents...maybe a dual boot...

And if law enforcement wanted to track a particular torrent they wouldn&#039;t have to be members of the exclusive torrent sites anyway, there&#039;s easier ways to do it.<br /><br />It makes me laugh when people are like &quot;ohhh yah yah I only get my torrents from private trackers&quot; and then they don&#039;t:<br /><br />A) Encrypt their torrent traffic<br /><br />B) Don&#039;t only accept connections from other encrypted peers<br /><br />C) Don&#039;t use a torrent specific VPN proxy service<br /><br />You may as well just go ahead and just use a regular torrent search engine like Pirate Bay.

				Yeah, I like this thread, like many, I&#039;m a movie buff...recently got a seedbox, that&#039;s a great way to avoid hassles with IP...and actually, kind of fun too, same reason I try different linux distros and stuff I&#039;ve picked up here....And many of the seedbox providers have and show you how to use ssh or vpn, proxies, anything you need...you can go in thru the shell account, even with windows, and tunnel in, so IP&#039;s don&#039;t get excited about seeding and such....<br /><br />Anyway, lots of good stuff out there...
