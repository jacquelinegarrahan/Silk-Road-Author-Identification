				Off the road scenario:&nbsp; Lets say you have had a relatively smooth relationship with someone, for years, a buyer and seller relationship.&nbsp; Things have been so smooth between you that you consider this person a friend.&nbsp; You know their family, you know their kids, all that cheesy shit.&nbsp; Then one day something goes awry, its usually something petty and involving money.&nbsp; This person then flips on you faster than u can blink and realize what the fuck is going on.&nbsp; All of a sudden this friendship turns to shit, all threats and hurt feelings.&nbsp; You realize from sitting back and reflecting on the years gone by, that this person was never your friend, just a glorified customer, someone using you only for the service you provide.&nbsp; I ask, is there no honor left in this world?

				Sorry to hear it... Been in similar situation. Terrible experience. On the contrary, I have been in the opposite situation, where something stupid happened between us, and it turned out to be cool.<br /><br />Patience... but it sounds like you already have it figured out... a smaller circle.<br /><br />Take care,<br />PerPETualMOtion
