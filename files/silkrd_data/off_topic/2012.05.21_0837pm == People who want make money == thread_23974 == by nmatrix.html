				Hi friends. We are nmatrix.<br /><br />We are looking for people who can work for us to make money.<br /><br />You need to be located in the United States. You don&#039;t need to be a citizen or something of that sort.<br /><br />This is not a drug trade business. Actually, you never touch drugs during the process unless you want to.<br /><br />You can make around 15000$ to 20000$ per month if you work good.<br /><br />It best for supporting drug habits and spending for better life.<br /><br />If interested, contact via PM.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

				To anyone curious: This guy is hiring for an ATM scam. I honestly doubt he&#039;s even legit in that sense, as he&#039;s asking for a deposit for the tools he&#039;ll send you.<br /><br />Stay away.

				Basically they want you to install a slimmer and send them the dumps. They want $500 to $1000 in escrow so you dont steal the skimmer and pinhole camera which seems way above the market rate of this equipment to me. Offering payment as either 50% of the card info or $175 per data dump. Given that these are carders I wouldn&#039;t trust them with monopoly money. Just my 2 cents YMMV.

				OP I was joking when I said &quot;I want di monies&quot;, I was just quoting Facejacker sketch where which is a Nigerian scammers catch phrase.<br /><br />Do not contact me offering me anymore golden opportunities, if I do need your services it will only be because I want to give someone a golden shower.<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br /><br />Limetless

				This is not a GOLDEN opportunity whatsoever. <br /><br />We don&#039;t ask you to send the escrow money to us. If we get any people who are interested to participate, we will set up a Silk Road vendor account to be able to use SR as escrow.<br /><br />Way above the market? I don&#039;t think you know what you are saying. An average skimmer costs 3000$. Our diebold model is the best in the market. It costs 2600$ without profit.<br /><br />To all who say that we are scammers, please don&#039;t comment before you don&#039;t know anything. As in everything, you need to work to earn money in this plan.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
