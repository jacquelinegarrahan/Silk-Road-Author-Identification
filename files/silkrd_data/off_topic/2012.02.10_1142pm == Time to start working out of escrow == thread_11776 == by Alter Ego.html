				I&#039;d like to propose since shit all has been done to fix the withdrawal issues in almost a week its time for an out of escrow mutiny. Our dear captain has been silent and is obviously unable to carry out his duty to keep this ship sailing smoothly. Something has to be done to shock his ass into action or even acknowledging the problem with a quick I&#039;m working on it message.

				What do you hope to achieve? Any vendors which take part in this action would lose customers, and/or would open themselves up to scams.

				LOL out of escrow mutiny.&nbsp; Look, SR are tough workers but they don&#039;t have the ability to instantly solve miracles for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Team SR have pulled through in the past and will pull through now, have patience. ::)

				I&#039;m sure they&#039;re working on it diligently. I had a wad of coin vanish, they made me whole in a couple days. Have a little faith.<br /><br />I highly suggest that vendors set up a wallet elsewhere and get the autowithdrawal feature&nbsp; enabled. It pretty much solves the problem and keeps your coins somewhere where you could access them in case of site failure.
