				Awwww yeah!!! Queen has a song to fit any occasion it seems like. Personally I&#039;ve always wanted to bang the fuck out of my mate&#039;s sexy milf of a mom to &quot;Don&#039;t Stop Me Now&quot; while he&#039;s trying to sleep in his room next door on account of I&#039;m always hitting on her which infuriates him like nothing else. ;D<br /><br />&quot;You&#039;re My Best Friend&quot; &amp; &quot;Play The Game&quot; are two favorites for those cuddle circles that inevitably happen when everyone rolls together.<br /><br />I really like &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; for when I&#039;m doing dishes, laundry, or some other meticulous chore to speed through it by moving to the beat of the song.<br /><br />Back when Call of Duty Black Ops came out I would fuck with people with high quality sound trolling by connecting the headset port to my laptop or iPhone which usually involved the spamming of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; &amp; &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;. Too bad MW3&#039;s voice quality went back down the shitter compared to Black Ops. :-\<br /><br />I could go on but you get the idea, Queen is often one of my go-to bands for when I&#039;m taking LSD. They&#039;re one of those blessed groups that I can listen to song after song and love every second of them, like The Doors, The Beatles, Lez Zeppelin, Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, etc. :))

I never herd this song or even knew of it until 5 minutes ago when I youtubed it...<br /><br />BouuuuuYaaaaaa....<br /><br />Sick.. and to wake up to it in the morning... even better.... its sad this dude took his own life...so much skill never to be developed....<br /><br />I heard this story, I think ima look into it further now that I&#039;m bringing it up in a public spot like this but I herd that either right before or after releasing Bohemian Rhapsody one of these guys took his own life, also I was told that this song was written about him coming out of the closet to his mom and everyone that he was gay and right after he killed himself... sad story!&nbsp; :(<br /><br /><br />****EDIT****<br /><br />I was wrong.. so the story is this.. Freddy Mercury the lead singer did not kill himself.. he died of a complication due to aids... I do however believe that Bohemian Rhapsody was written for him to come out as a homosexual...None the less its sad because they made some good music!<br /><br />Sorry for the mis-info

				Sheer Heart Attack is the best Queen album, imo. Lots of people don&#039;t realize that Queen was considered a &quot;hard rock&quot; band at the time, and they proved it on this album...
