				Anybody here have any ideas how to convert speed paste into nice large clear crystals which can be smoked? Yes, it can be done, and yes there is a huge market for it here in Australia, just gotta work out how to fucking do it. Something to do with Acetone or something, it&#039;s a pretty basic conversion but I just can&#039;t work it out.

				First off I am no chemist or an expert and I don&#039;t even play one on TV.<br /><br />But<br /><br />My understanding is you use acetone because the speed will not dissolve in it but many cuts will.&nbsp; Do a few rinses with that.&nbsp; Then use denatured alcohol because the speed will dissolve in that but not the cut.&nbsp; You can then filter it and get cleaner dope.&nbsp; Now this process is described in detail many places on the clearnet.&nbsp; So if you are gonna do this, definitely take the time to read about the process and do your homework.&nbsp; <br /><br />Because that is paste you may have to do recrystallization.&nbsp; That is an entirely different subject and is way more involved.&nbsp; There is tons of good info out there covering these subject all the way to reductive amination.&nbsp; Again, you will need to do a lot of reading, or even consult someone with a chemistry background before attempting any of this.<br /><br />

				I was thinking about that.&nbsp; If it is just amphetamine in a paste and not meth, then it will take a much bigger effort.&nbsp; Probably way more trouble than it is worth. Look up converting amphetamine to meth.&nbsp; There is info out there but, what I have read is that if you are gonna through that trouble, you might as well get precursor and just make meth.&nbsp;

				Pretty much what ch0sen said but I&#039;d suggest not trying it for the sake of your health unless you can get your hands on pure amphetamine crystals.

				You can either have large nice crystals or be able to smoke it, not both.<br />If its in freebase form converting to crystals takes a little chemistry.

				I don&#039;t think all the effort is worth it for how costly it is.<br />you might aswell just import ephedrine or pseudoephedrine and make meth yourself(forgot which one is best, i heard its the latter)<br />I don&#039;t think smoking meth is worth it either, Its enjoyable, but eating meth is much more powerful and euphoric and a little goes a very long way, you just have to wait a little while.<br />-in the mean time, you could sniff a little bump to start you off.<br />

				The speed paste is best laid out and allowed to dry.&nbsp; Then when dry you can scrape it up into a line and snort it.<br /><br />That is probably your best bet.

How does this work? Speed paste when dried out turns into powder form which cannot be smoked, so to convert it to make it smokable I believe it becomes crystals? Just like Methamphetamine, except just amphetamines.
