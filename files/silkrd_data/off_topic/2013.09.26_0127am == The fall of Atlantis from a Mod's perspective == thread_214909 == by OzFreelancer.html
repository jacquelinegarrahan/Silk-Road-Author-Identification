				And to think the sheeple believed they would return their coins. All the traitors and Rats who defected&nbsp; to Atlantis have come back to SR&nbsp; with their slimy Rat tails&nbsp; between their legs.<br /><br />What do you expect when you are dealing with Eastern European thieves ? The writing was on the wall, unfortunately the drumbeat of their impending doom was inaudible to many.

				A pretty big humble reminder of how much trust we put into SR staff and DPR.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for not taking my coins DPR, even if you have the word pirate in your name.&nbsp; That&#039;s pretty special of you.

				Not surprised. Glad I only went over there once... and it was to question their business practices. After 1 reply from the admin and I knew I would never go back. <br /><br />Smart scam though... I wonder how much they made off with?

				I had two accounts on Atlantis, luckily, with really minor amounts of coins -&nbsp; tried to withdraw coins from both, a few times, it said &quot;OK&quot; but no coins were withdrawn. First I believed it was my fault, but in the end it appeared they didn&#039;t plan for us to withdraw after shutdown announcement.<br /><br />There&#039;s still the possibility they staged this whole event to make big profit from crypto vs. crypto trading, and will reopen the site at some critical point - you never know!<br /><br />The fact that another large litecoin trading site announces shutdown around the same time, makes me wonder, as well.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can&#039;t trust the Admins, who can you trust?<br />I was immediately suspicious of Atlantis, mainly because of the botnet attack,<br />and how they presented their products.&nbsp; Instead of ranking or providing anything to<br />verify authenticity, they were like a really bad spam ad, the kind you get here on<br />the forums for cocaine in your PM box, that is essentially what it was.&nbsp; <br />The &quot;Nazi&quot; ecstasy pill was another thing that rubbed me the wrong way, <br />I(well, the Mrs.) bought an incense burner with a hidden swastika on it the other day, it <br />didn&#039;t make it a &quot;nazi&quot; incense burner, and I have no idea why, someone would trust<br />someone who cares so little about their products as to allow such a listing, it was tasteless.<br />Their social media campaign was something else! I am surprised they lasted,<br />even people selling weed and other simple items couldn&#039;t make sales on there. <br />&nbsp;I tell people this all the time, but the commission/vendor bond is what makes SR<br />stay honest, after all, who is going to fuck up sales, when there is a bond/commission at stake?<br />we(the customers) are not so cheaply bought, and other sites should take notice.<br />It does kindof suck that they are closed now(?), because many targets are better than<br />one or two.&nbsp; Thank goodness BMR is still around, otherwise we&#039;d have our <br />proverbial cock stuck in a hornet&#039;s nest.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m not sure what I mean by that, but damn.

				I pretty much kept my opinions to myself regarding Atlantis because of obvious conflicts of interest and how others may perceive my intentions but the few times I did say anything I said they were shady as fuck.<br /><br />Fuck Atlantis and I am glad they are gone, never trusted them and now they have proven my suspicions correct all along.

				The only bad thing about atlantis going is all the 14yr old who saw a ad on youtube and downloaded tor are going to migrate over here. I dont mind if someone is young and savy and find this place but being given directions on something so mainstream as youtube (or reddit for that matter) seems bad to me but thats just my opinion
