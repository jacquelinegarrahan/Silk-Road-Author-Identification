				hey yall,<br /><br />I noticed under someones user name that it said &quot;SR geek&quot; in the black lettering as well which I have never seen before. I was surprised also because it is a newbie by post count but the yellow bar rating is equivalent to a senior member. I was just curious if anyone knows what this means or why this person has a very unique status to their acct? Surprised I have never noticed it before after so long. <br /><br />Thanks! <br />- miR

				I think the yellow bar implies how long you&#039;ve been on the forum.

				I thought it was based on post count, although I could be wrong I think that&#039;s how it&#039;s done on other forums.

				thanks for the responses! <br /><br />i dont really think it can regarding the duration of his acct membership, because the one I am referring to has only been registered since Jan 20. <br /><br />also, I am more interested in the &quot;SR Geek&quot; title that this member has than the yellow bar status. does anyone know what this means??? thank you, I am just curious. maybe they have special privileges or something interesting<br /><br />if you want to see what I am referring to, check out this thread about halfway down, for the member a_blackbird<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15081.0<br /><br />love yall :)<br />- miR
