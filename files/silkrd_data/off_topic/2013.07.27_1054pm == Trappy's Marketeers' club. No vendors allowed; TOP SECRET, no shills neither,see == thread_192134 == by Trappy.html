				Welcome to the club, pull up a chair and puff your blunt. Where you&#039;re half marketeer, half psychiatrist, and half trying to keep your own sanity together. We&#039;re still on average 200% more mentally sound than the average vendor, depending on the market. <br /><br />And the market? I love the individuals that make up each, you give them the traits and characteristics that I can observe from afar. We&#039;ll talk more about the markets later. <br /><br /><br />Who else caught a gig like me? Too cheap to spend $500 worth of bitcoin on a vendor account, but just as willing to push product. I&#039;ve made $25 worth of tips so far <br /><br /><br />What do you think of it? I don&#039;t think I&#039;m the oldest among us, having done this gig for a few months now. Other vendors came with their own salesmen, but I think its a completely different experience to watch the TOR network grow up and then sell to it, than to simply sell to it without having existed in its midst for a long duration of time.<br /><br /><br /><br />Just, where did all the old dogs go? I haven&#039;t clicked another 2011 user since DPR, although I know many of you use fresh accounts. Or are we staying hush&nbsp; hush on that?

				If you&#039;re a broke kid from reddit seeing this and want to ever do the same, don&#039;t match your reddit account with your silk road account. <br /><br /><br />You&#039;re in the den of high strung idiots, sociopaths, addicts, drug manufacturers, broke middle men, amateurs, and those are just my favorite types of people on here.<br /><br />Movers and shakers exist on here as well, but they can&#039;t decide if they want their real life celebrity to affect them online or not. More trouble than its worth, usually.

An esteemed member of our community. But eventually bitcoins fell into my lap, and paypal froze my account for other unrelated reasons and I&#039;ve completely moved on.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like paypal.

I came across as knowledgeable about local markets and the vendor in question actually gave me some pot for free (I among others), ate the shipping fee too, and so I gave him some data and numbers for free and it spiraled from there. The benefit is mutual, although obviously one sided. Hence, UNIONS!<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, with most vendors I attempt to get an up front fee but none have gone for it yet. I think I offer a better deal with the up front retainer fee, but the $500 vendor bond is a lot of money to a lot of people and my retainer fee is 1/5th of that.<br /><br />Instead, I double my commission rate. After 2 months, I&#039;ll make more than I would with a retainer in the pocket and half the commission rate. <br /><br /><br />People are much more willing to give you money after you&#039;ve made them money than before.

				And so thoroughly privileged we are. I think, and type, with this joint in my hand and no pistol in my waistband. <br />Kids throw their lives away for less than a vendor fee, and I&#039;m right here, being me. With this joint in my hand. <br />Just dreaming of this and TORland.
