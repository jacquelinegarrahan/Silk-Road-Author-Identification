				As many of you remember, instawallet was compromised a few months back (April to be specific), and they shut down their service and opened up a claim process. They promised to refund accounts on July 1st. I patiently waited, July 1st came and went, and I still don&#039;t have my bitcoins back. I submitted another claim on July 3rd and still haven&#039;t seen my BTC. Has anyone else received a refund from their former instawallet holdings?

				they came out and claim 1st july was a typo and that it would be refunded on jully 11th<br /><br />but its smelling like a &quot;wait till the coin price drops&quot;<br /><br />dont be surprised if the end up making an excuse on july 11th.<br /><br />and whatever you do, dont write them a nasty email&nbsp; &nbsp;otherwise they&#039;ll have a an excuse to give up on 3 million other account payouts.. they even lied about filing a police report.<br /><br />if you get anything back the btc will be 10 times less than what you paid for them..

				I sent a polite e-mail asking what happened and they explained what you described. <br /><br />My BTC were worth around $1,500 when instawallet went down. Up until a few weeks ago it was still pretty close to that, circa $1300, but the market has been down about 30% for a weeks now and I&#039;ll be lucky to get $1,000. It&#039;s not instawallets fault, I blame myself for trusting them after their service went down a few months before they were hacked. <br /><br />Actually, it&#039;s really hard to tell what systems and services you can trust in regards to BTC...a lot of sites get shut down or disappear in the blink of an eye. I remember at the end of 2012 when SR was having serious issues a lot of people bailed. You gotta have a stomach made of steel to be in this digital wild west.
