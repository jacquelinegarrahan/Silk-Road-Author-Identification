It is only conjecture, I don&#039;t have anything to back it up beyond the sense that you are very much &quot;like&quot; Social. It isn&#039;t even really my opinion, just what my subconscious processes have decided for my conscious mind. If you aren&#039;t part of Social, that&#039;s fine.<br /><br />But, on the side... do you really think she isn&#039;t LE? The tactics, alone, reek of LE. And the rationale I give to my subconsciousness deciding that you&#039;re Social is that you seem to have been aiding those tactics.<br /><br />I know this is a manipulative appeal, and I&#039;m warning you that it is so that you can react properly without being influenced, but... if you love the Silk Road, shouldn&#039;t you be trying to defend it as well? Yes, Limetless might be a danger to it... but can you say that Social isn&#039;t? Social is probably a smaller danger I&#039;m sure, but Limetless, if he is a danger, isn&#039;t the kind that is going to harm the Road. At worst, he is just a scammer. Social is turning people against each other, however. Social is more dangerous to the community. Limetless is just, at worst, a danger to their wallets.

				I am the only one that can answer these questions truthfully.<br /><br />1. Am I LE? NO<br />2. Is punkst0ner me? NO<br />3. Am I employed as a &quot;Whore&quot;? NO<br /><br />I have answered all these questions 100% truthfully and honestly.<br /><br />Yes, BR, your right, I love SR, and I am doing my best to defend it!<br /><br />Naturally, when this whole Limetless controversy came to light, people were going to be divided on it. It was never going to go 100% either way, I was hoping for more sensible discussion, like yourself, when you started up the no bullshit Limetless thread in hope of some rationality I thought it was a good idea. What happened to it?<br /><br />With me, it seems because I am the one that is the OP of that thread, it caused a lot of controversy within itself. I do not know why, but it just did. Especially with those from that &quot;verbal diarrhea&quot; thread, that feebly attempted to devalue it&#039;s integrity, with slanderous accusations they cannot prove.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have produced black and white evidence, that he copied word for world, not very professional behavouir from a vendor and op that&#039;s held in highest esteem. You have also made some good points on other issues. There have been good points raised on the Vlad thread too.<br /><br />I have answered all your questions, so I am not the issue here. <br /><br />There are much bigger and more important issues that need to be addressed, for the good of everyone on SR. Everyone that loves SR for it&#039;s freedom of choice and freedom of social expression, should be focusing on the real issues right now!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Hopefully &quot;the real truth&quot;, we are seeking will be found out soon!&nbsp; :)
