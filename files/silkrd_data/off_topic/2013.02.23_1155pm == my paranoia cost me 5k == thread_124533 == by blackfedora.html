				What did you do flush your $4350 of your stash or something? Then did you drive to a store, buy cleaning supplies, drive back, clean house, open ripped package on doorstep, and finally slapping your forehead? Interesting lol.

				That sucks, I can so relate though.&nbsp; Many years ago I woke up and there were some police knocking on my door.&nbsp; Before opening it, in a panic I went and started flushing all my stash, and probably flushed about 2000 dollars worth of mostly weed, lsd and mushrooms.&nbsp; When I opened the door it turned out they were there just to ask if I&#039;d seen anything suspicious the previous night, as apparently my elderly neighbor had been burglarized and there had been a home invasion during the night.&nbsp; I felt like such an idiot afterwards and worse yet I had almost no drugs left besides some shwag I hadn&#039;t flushed.
