				I have schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder, I&#039;m not really sure, but psychosis is my main symptom.&nbsp; I can go off meds for months and not become psychotic which is when I take drugs.&nbsp; I love psychedelic drugs.&nbsp; LSD is my favorite.&nbsp; And weed.&nbsp; It&#039;s like I&#039;m crazy and I enjoy become crazier.&nbsp; Before people tell me how bad it is for mental illness and using drugs...I don&#039;t really give a fuck.&nbsp; I know what I&#039;m capable of.&nbsp; This threads not for that.&nbsp; Anyone else self-medicate mental illness with drugs?&nbsp; <br /><br />It was definitely self-medication for me in the past, now I just enjoy it.&nbsp; Because I feel I&#039;ve medicated myself all I&#039;m capable of through drugs.&nbsp; Anybody else?

				I would imagine that the drug of choice for a mentally ill user, would vary according to the individuals illness.
