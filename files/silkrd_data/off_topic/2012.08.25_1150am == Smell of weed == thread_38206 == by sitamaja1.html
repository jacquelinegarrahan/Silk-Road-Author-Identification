				Ugh, so I didn&#039;t know where else to post this :D<br />So the question is pretty straight forward: What&#039;s the deal with the smell of weed? Where does it come from? Why some strains have stronger smell/other lighter? Does it have to do how they&#039;re grown?(organic/not organic?)<br /><br />If You care to take the time to answer these, then that would be very appreciated. :)<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I&#039;m not a botanist so I&#039;m not exactly sure, just taking a wild guess.&nbsp; Anyways, marijuana is a flower plant.&nbsp; What your smoking are flowers and as you know flowers usually have a distinct smell.&nbsp; But what makes marijuana smell so much is probably due to the trichomes and the natural smell given off from the plant matter it self is probably too attract animals.&nbsp; Deers from what I know love wild growing weed plants.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Gee why do roses smell?&nbsp; Why do they all smell so different? Because they are different!!!&nbsp; There are over 100 different types of roses, &amp; if you were to start doing as much hybrid work with the roses as goes on with cannabis, you might start to understand why there&#039;s so many different smells, but it is essentially the different combinations of terpenes that create the different smells.&nbsp; HERE IS A CLEARNET ARTICLE:<br /><br />http://www.theweedblog.com/terpenes-and-the-smell-of-marijuana/<br /><br /><br />NCK

				It is the oils in the resin that smell. They evaporate. If you leave your bud out of it&#039;s bag it will reek at first and then less and less so as the oils are released.
