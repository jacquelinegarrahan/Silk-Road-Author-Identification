				Because I&#039;ve certainly never ended up with a zebra in my car, yet.<br /><br />http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/22/justice/iowa-arrest-zebra/index.html<br /><br />The charge is rather routine -- an Iowa man was arrested over the weekend, accused of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, according to a police report. What makes this case unusual are the passengers that police in Dubuque say were with him: a parrot on his shoulder and a zebra in the back seat.<br /><br />&quot;They love going for rides,&quot; John Reiter&#039;s girlfriend, Vicky Teters, said to CNN affiliate KCRG.<br /><br />&quot;We treat them like our kids. They come in the house, we take them outside and take them for walks. We take them for car rides,&quot; Teters told KCRG. &quot;They go and get the mail with me.&quot;<br /><br />Dubuque Police Lt. Samuel Baxter told CNN that quite a few people called in to alert the police about a &quot;zebra and parrot trapped in a vehicle parked at a bar.&quot;<br /><br />Officer Chad Leitzen described in his report what he saw as he arrived: &quot;I did observe two white male subjects in the front of the vehicle. I also observed a zebra in the back seat of the vehicle and a parrot on the driver&#039;s shoulder.&quot;<br /><br />Leitzen then conducted a breathalyzer test that he said Reiter subsequently failed with a blood alcohol content of .148. The legal limit in Iowa is .08, according to Iowa&#039;s Department of Transportation website.<br /><br />Reiter was arrested Sunday and held overnight, while the zebra and parrot were taken safely to a friend&#039;s house.

				While the penguin story sounds cool, it seems a bit reminiscent of The Hangover, like the article said.<br />The guy with the zebra and parrot apparently keeps these things as pets, seeing as he takes them on walks, car rides, ect. Which is 10x cooler than drunkenly stealing a penguin, IMO.

				Why would you want to steal one though? If your in the zoo, why not do it big, a giraffe or walrus or something.
