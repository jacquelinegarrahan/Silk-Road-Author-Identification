				I know you always hear that you should not lose weight fast but let&#039;s face it you shouldn&#039;t weigh double your healthy weight either.&nbsp; So many people are obese and morbidly obese that we aren&#039;t shocked about it anymore.&nbsp; We have the drive-through culture, no time to cook healthy meals, and even less time for exercise.&nbsp; In the meantime, we are taking more and more blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, erection drugs, and we are drinking more and smoking more weed and taking more benzos to relax with all of the stress in society.<br /><br />The fact is we need to lose weight if we are fat.&nbsp; Everyone knows that.&nbsp; Most people can take off as little as 25 pounds and throw away the blood pressure medication.&nbsp; We can get over the hump with a boost.&nbsp; The hump keeps you fat.&nbsp; You have no energy so you don&#039;t move as much.&nbsp; And you gain weight, which makes your heart work harder, and you have less energy and don&#039;t move as much.&nbsp; That is the vicious cycle.&nbsp; Do you know how much energy you can gain by losing 20 or 30 pounds?&nbsp; The answer might surprise you, and it might help you get over that hump of low activity and weight gain.&nbsp; Your body responds very quickly when you lose even 5% of your body weight.&nbsp; If you weigh 300 pounds, that is only 15 pounds.&nbsp; You might be skeptical but I assure you a 5% lose of your weight- only 10 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds- will give you an unbelievable burst of new energy.&nbsp; You will have enough to do the things that you used to do 5, 10, or 20 years ago.&nbsp; You will have more sex, exercise more, and cook for yourself or your family instead of grabbing fast food or getting a pizza because you are DEAD TIRED and haven&#039;t an ounce of energy to spare.&nbsp; <br /><br />You need to get over the hump.&nbsp; It is self-destructive and takes its toll on your marriage, your sex life, your relationship with you family, your boss, and your co-workers.&nbsp; If you lose 5% of your weight all of these things will improve with your new-found energy, your new healthier diet that comes as a result of more energy, and you will be thrilled and shocked by the changes in you.<br /><br />If you know what I am telling you is true- and most certainly you do know this- why not consider trying a combination of diet pills that is used by housewives, hollywood acresses and actors, as well as bodybuilders who are getting ready for competition?&nbsp; Maybe you have tried diet pills before?&nbsp; Maybe you have not had the results that you hoped for?<br /><br />The size zero pill clenbuterol is an outstanding fat-burner.&nbsp; It is a thermogenic agent which slightly raises your body temperature (about one degree fahrenheit) and thus causes you to burn more calories even if you are sitting on the sofa.&nbsp; Now I am not telling you that you don&#039;t need to exercise.&nbsp; You do.&nbsp; This is just to speed the weight loss.&nbsp; Most bodybuilders combine clenbuterol with T3 which causes your thyroid to increase your metabolism.&nbsp; As a combination, they are unbeatable.&nbsp; They are extremely potent but the side effects are mild.&nbsp; Best of all, you control the dosage of clenbuterol so if you start to feel a little bit nervous or jittery, just cut back a little and you have found your target zone.&nbsp; You take these three weeks on and three weeks off.&nbsp; During the last week of the three that you are taking clenbuterol and T3, just take 50mg or 100mg of diphenhydramine (benadryl) at night before you sleep.&nbsp; This refreshes your receptors and makes the clenbuterol and T3 even more effective.&nbsp; <br /><br />For especially stubborn weight loss, or especially obese folks, I highly recommend adding Duromine [phentermine] as it is a superb appetite suppressant.&nbsp; How much weight could you lose if you didn&#039;t crave food?&nbsp; Or course you will need to take a walk once per day.&nbsp; If you have been sedentary for a while, start with a 20-30 minute walk.&nbsp; If you can work your way up very gradually- adding only one minute to your daily walk every week- you will soon be walking 75 minutes per day and this is the magical target for massive weight loss.&nbsp; You can lose 100 or more pounds if you are morbidly obese and do it without craving food.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				or just eat all meat (high fat diet)<br /><br />you will lose weight and stay that way.&nbsp; I have eaten all meat for 9 months now.&nbsp; I lost 25lbs in the first few months and now I weight 127.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t eat this way to lose weight though.&nbsp; You must eat it pretty rare to get your nutrition.&nbsp; I eat about 2lb of steak a day.&nbsp; I tell the butcher not to cut off the fat and i cook the steaks about 30 seconds on each side and they are about 1 inch thick.&nbsp; No supplements necessary.&nbsp; You get all you need.&nbsp; I eat zero sugar/carb.&nbsp; I also do not use any type of seasoning.&nbsp; I basically eat nothing but steak.&nbsp; I learn this from Owsley Stanley ( I used to talk to him through email ) <br /><br />No need to buy pills.. or starve yourself.&nbsp; Eat all the meat you want.<br />http://forum.lowcarber.org/showthread.php?t=287013&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15<br /><br />I no longer have asthma..

				There are so many dosing schedules for clenbuterol that people are baffled.&nbsp; Let me simplify it.&nbsp; The tablets are 20mcg and you get 200 of them in a bottle.&nbsp; On the first day that you start, take one pill if you are a healthy person without undue sensitivity to stimulants like Sudafed (the nasal decongestant) or caffeine.&nbsp; At 4PM, take another one.&nbsp; That is simple- day one, and one pill in the morning and one in the evening.&nbsp; If all was well, and you didn&#039;t feel nervous, jittery, or have anxiety or beat anyone in the face, head, or neck- then on the next day you will double your dosage in the morning and afternoon.&nbsp; Take two pills in the AM.&nbsp; Take two at about 4PM.&nbsp; Monitor your mood and see if you feel like it is too much.&nbsp; If at any time you feel nervous, just stop at that point.&nbsp; No need to keep pushing.&nbsp; You will still lose weight.&nbsp; Stick with that dosage and in a very short time your body will adjust to it.&nbsp; Some people who were nervous or jittery on 3 pills in the morning and 3 in the afternoon are just fine on 3/3 the very next day.&nbsp; You body is used to it now.&nbsp; If you start to feel that you have adjusted to 3/3, bump the dosage to 4/4.&nbsp; That is- four tablets in the morning and four at 4PM.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take them too late in the day because you will likely have trouble sleeping!!!<br /><br />Keep going like that until you are at the third week.&nbsp; A few days before you are at day 21, maybe about day 16- you can do a deceleration.&nbsp; Go from four pills (or wherever you are) in the morning to 3 pills.&nbsp; Then in the afternoon you will also do 3 pills.&nbsp; So you went from 4/4 on day 16 to 3/3 on day 17.&nbsp; Then keep that up until you are at day 21.&nbsp; Maybe you feel like you don&#039;t need to cut as fast and that is fine.&nbsp; This is your program and you should adjust the levels to how you feel and what you think is best.&nbsp; Otherwise cut more and on day 21 you will be able to stop.&nbsp; That is the end of the cycle and you can take three weeks off now.&nbsp; Your receptors- the neurological components that are &quot;acted upon&quot; by the medications- will need time to re-charge.&nbsp; Your body adapts, so we are tricking it in the three weeks off.&nbsp; For the next cycle of 3 weeks on, do the same thing you did before.&nbsp; Maybe you feel you can start right out at 2 pills in the morning, and 2 in the afternoon.&nbsp; Go ahead.&nbsp; You are the boss.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a problem.&nbsp; If you feel nervous, cut back a little bit.&nbsp; Some of you will want to cut back from say- 4/4 to 3/3.&nbsp; But maybe you like the extra boost with your morning coffee.&nbsp; Maybe the clenbuterol helps you wake up and feel ready for the day.&nbsp; So keep the 4 pills in the morning and cut back to 3 in the afternoon if you have to because of nervousness.&nbsp; It&#039;s your program.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need anyone to run your program but you.&nbsp; Advice is fine, but most Western people have lost the ability to think for themselves.&nbsp; We think only a doctor can make decisions for us.&nbsp; But you don&#039;t need a doctor to take clenbuterol and T3 unless you have health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, or are taking other medications.&nbsp; If you are worried about the medicine you take now and think there may be an adverse reaction please see your doctor.&nbsp; You can also use the internet to research this topic.&nbsp; Doctors are not God!!&nbsp; They are not Buddha!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; <br /><br />Any person who is seriously overweight should check their blood pressure every day in the morning and evening if they want to use clenbuterol and T3.&nbsp; The cuffs are so cheap on Amazon.com that you have no excuse.&nbsp; Just do it as the Nike commercial says.&nbsp; <br /><br />Let&#039;s talk a little bit about T3.&nbsp; While clenbuterol is a stimulant and thermogenic agent, T3 acts as a mild stimulant but also accelerates the thyroid function in order to increase your metabolism.&nbsp; When taken with clenbuterol, the two interact in a way that makes both more effective.&nbsp; It is an extremely powerful fat-burning combination that you can no beat with a stick.&nbsp; Take 1/2 of a tablet of T3 in the morning that you take your clenbuterol dose for the first time.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; The next day take a 1/2 tablet.&nbsp; After a week if you notice no side effects, you can increase to one full tablet in the morning.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; That is your regular dosage now and forever.&nbsp; With T3, you just take one tablet in the morning.&nbsp; Now a word on side effects.&nbsp; If you notice unusual itching, cut back to 1/2 tablet of T3.&nbsp; That is all you need to know about T3.&nbsp; Like every other effective drug, there is a ton of misinformation about T3.&nbsp; The scare-mongers will tell you that T3 will stop your thyroid from working and you will need to take T3 for the rest of your life.&nbsp; It is not true.&nbsp; Anyone that can find a single article that substantiates this absurd claim about T3 is welcome to post the link in this thread.&nbsp; As long as it is a respected medical journal and the methodologies are sound and well-documented, post it here.&nbsp; You won&#039;t find any.&nbsp; There are none.&nbsp;

				This morning I met a friend who had some of the best cocaine he has ever gotten, and he normally has really, really good coke.&nbsp; We snorted a couple of lines each.&nbsp; Then he pulled out the meth!!!&nbsp; Oh- my- Buddha!!!!&nbsp; And you know what?<br /><br />Right now I feel better than I have ever felt in my life!!!!&nbsp; So, it must be the great coke and meth?<br /><br />Let&#039;s avoid silly fallacies in reasoning and stick to fact.&nbsp; Because eating a certain way causes you to lose weight does not mean it is good for you.&nbsp; Because you feel good does not mean you are healthy.&nbsp; If you want to be healthy, eat a variety of healthy foods.&nbsp; Avoid processed foods, snack foods in a bag, and frozen foods.&nbsp; Frozen vegetables are fine sometimes, but don&#039;t eat TV dinners or lasagna from a box.&nbsp; Foods like this are riddled with sodium and animal fat and chemical foods like high fructose corn syrup which is a medical disaster.&nbsp; If you see a food advertised on television, don&#039;t eat it.&nbsp;

				One of the biggest struggles for people dieting is their appetite.&nbsp; When you increase your exercise and cut your calorie intake, you get hungry!&nbsp; You have to train your mind to beat this feeling.&nbsp; You have to have a dead-rational approach.&nbsp; You will not starve.&nbsp; You will be fine.&nbsp; You have to force your body to burn fat.&nbsp; There is no way to do this but create a calorie deficit.&nbsp; Eat fewer calories than you take in so that your body is forced to burn fat for your energy needs.<br /><br />You will also need to drink a lot of water to keep from feeling tired!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; When your body is burning fat instead of the glycogen that is stored in your muscles and liver, it is working hard.&nbsp; The mechanisms by which fat is broken down and made metabolically available are energy-intensive processes.&nbsp; That is why your body avoids it.&nbsp; This is a means to preserve the species.&nbsp; Fat is stored for a rainy day.&nbsp; It is extremely calorie-dense and it will last you a long time- much longer than the glycogen stored in your muscles and liver.&nbsp; So you make your body break the fat down by eating less and moving more.&nbsp; And because this makes your body work hard and uses extra water on the cellular level, you need to drink more water.&nbsp; Just do it.&nbsp; Drink at least eight 12oz glasses of water per day.&nbsp; Drink more if you can.&nbsp; Your body is mostly water.&nbsp; Give your body what it needs to utilize your fat stores and it will let go of them more readily.&nbsp; You have to fight the body&#039;s urge to preserve the fat.&nbsp; If you are dehydrated, it will be much, much harder to lose weight.<br /><br />In all of this turmoil for your body, your appetite will increase as we have said.&nbsp; So how can you battle this?&nbsp; Well, phentermine is one of the most effective appetite suppresants that is known to exist.&nbsp; It is a very simple remedy to get you started on your weight loss and to super-charge the clenbuterol/T3 stack (or combination) of medicines.&nbsp; If you can limit your appetite while T3 is kicking your metabolism into high gear and clenbuterol is burning fat thermogenically, you are way ahead of the game.&nbsp; You will lose weight ALMOST EFFORTLESSLY.<br /><br />I am a big eater, and when I am taking phentermine [Duromine] I can skip an entire meal or even two.&nbsp; I know this sounds like an amazing claim, but it is true.&nbsp; I can even feel hungry, but I am missing that huge motivation to eat that normally accompanies me like a friend who is a bad influence.<br /><br />It isn&#039;t fair that you should have to struggle against impossibly long odds to lose weight.&nbsp; How many men who surpass 250 pounds one time in their life end up dying weighing 250 or more?&nbsp; Most.&nbsp; It is damn hard to lose weight.&nbsp; It has not been a natural process that got you to 250 or 300 or 400 pounds.&nbsp; Phentermine is only for the mobidly obese and is not recommended for use beyond 12 weeks.&nbsp; But if you weight 250 pounds or more, you need help.&nbsp; You are risking your health by carrying so much extra weight.&nbsp; Duromine [phentermine] is that help.&nbsp; Just take a single tablet 30 minutes before breakfast.&nbsp; This the the final aspect of the clenbuterol/T3/Duromine triad.&nbsp; It is without a doubt the most effective weight-loss combination ever dreamed of by man.&nbsp; It is extraordnarily and irrefutable effective even for people who have failed ENDLESSLY in their weight loss aspirations for their entire life.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				sorry guys but flaxceed is spewing a bunch of bullshit.&nbsp; I think Ill take owsley&#039;s word over yours and my own experiences suggest he is right as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont have epilepsy or asthma anymore..

I just feel better.&nbsp; I havn&#039;t been sick once.&nbsp; I dont get runny noses or soar throats in the morning anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />I havn&#039;t eaten a single vegatable/carb in 9 months.<br /><br />Owsley only ate meat for over 50 years.&nbsp; His son starfinder has eaten that way since he was born.&nbsp; Read the link I posted before replying.&nbsp; It is very helpful and can seriously change your life.<br /><br />You have to be a very strong willed person to give up carbs.&nbsp; It is much like getting over a heroin addiction.&nbsp; Your first week of heavy induction is really hard to get through.<br /><br />Also appetite is no problem on this diet.&nbsp; You can eat as much as you want!&nbsp; You feel satiated and have long term energy.&nbsp; You dont crash and get hungry a few hours a later.&nbsp; I only eat 1 meal a day and work 12 hours days 5 days a week.&nbsp; <br /><br />Battling your appetite is just stupid.&nbsp; Your body is saying it isn&#039;t satisfied for a reason.&nbsp; I dont battle it, I embrace it.&nbsp; I eat all the steak I want until I cant get anymore down and then lick up the bloody mess that is left on the plate<br /><br />Also, cultures that live the longest say it is because they usually only stick to one food.&nbsp; There is cultures that lives into mid 100&#039;s and they only eat a couple type of foods their entire lives.&nbsp; No living beings are meant to eat all things to survive.&nbsp; We have evolved to eat meat.&nbsp; Just do your research i dont feel like getting into it.<br /><br />Read about vladimir stephenson<br />read about owsley stanley<br />read about pemmican and the plains indians<br />read about pemmican and the fur trades<br />realize agriculture has only been around for about 15k years<br />human fossils have been found over a million years ago.&nbsp; <br />Human skulls have been found to have all their teeth from back then.&nbsp; which cannot happen without a toothbrush and a high carb diet.&nbsp; you cannot damage your teeth on a meat diet.&nbsp; <br />I can go on and on.. i dont want to.&nbsp; I am tired of it.&nbsp; You can do the research yourself.. its all there.&nbsp; Owsley Stanley deserves a lot of respect and I would read every word he has written on the link I posted above.<br /><br /><br />Also the fact that we stepped outside of our food chain is the reason for our population problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is the truth folks.&nbsp; buy his pills if you want, but know the truth.&nbsp;

				Taking clenbuterol/T3/phentermine is not a good thing to do.&nbsp; You should tough it out and do it naturally.&nbsp; How is that going for you?<br /><br />You will never lose weight if you don&#039;t face facts.&nbsp; Here is a fact.&nbsp; Our society in the West is not natural.&nbsp; Driving everywhere instead of walking or running is not natural.&nbsp; Drive-through fast food is not normal.&nbsp; Working 50 or more hours every week and only managing to meet basic needs and pay the tax man is not normal.&nbsp; The things that go you in this pickle are not normal.&nbsp; You MUST face the fact that you have pushed your body beyond the point of no return.&nbsp; Without the clenbuterol/T3/phentermine stack you will stay fat.&nbsp; This stack is your key to a new life.&nbsp; Of course you ONLY need this stack of extremely effective fat-burners to START your journey.&nbsp; You will not keep taking it, and you most certainly will not need it to finish your journey.&nbsp; You will finish the journey with quality natural foods, and a wide variety of them.&nbsp; You will exercise and enjoy your new explosive energy for sex with your mate and for playing with you kids and maybe even joining the company softball team.&nbsp; <br /><br />Throw off the chains and throw away the old life in which you are trapped.&nbsp; Morbid obesity is a prison sentence.&nbsp; You can beat it now with this amazing triad of medications, and very shortly you can continue your journey free of any medications at all.&nbsp; Nature did not get you to 300 pounds or more, and there is virtually no way for you to get under 300 pounds with natural means.&nbsp; You will fail.&nbsp; Again.<br /><br />The clenbuterol/T3/Duromine stack of medications is your key to a new life, a happier marriage and more fulfilling family life, and more earnings in your career.&nbsp; You can and will lose weight with sensible nutrition, portion control, lots of dirty, dirty sex, and the clenbuterol/T3/Duromine stack.&nbsp; At least once per week you should change up your exercise routine and fuck your mate to within an inch of his or her life.&nbsp; Your mate needs to participate in this journey with you and this is precisely the kind of participation and encouragement that is required.&nbsp; Buy him/her some lingerie, invest in some new lubrication, and watch some pornography.&nbsp; Tie her up and abuse her!&nbsp; It is your right- you are losing weight and becoming more desirable and more powerful.&nbsp; Likewise with women- tie him up and whip is little pathetic pussy ass.&nbsp; You are in charge with your new lifestyle and you can leverage this this to create a fabulous new and extraordinarily filthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Take pictures of her, or videos- and send them to me!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; Joke there, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; Ahem.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ask for a raise.&nbsp; They know you are changing very fast.&nbsp; Do they want to pay for your new performance, or should you take it elsewhere?

				I got to apologize, though.&nbsp; Going back and reading my post I feel like a dick.&nbsp; I barged into your product offer thread and started going on and on about health and im sure that can hurt your business a little.&nbsp; I just see diet pills being sold all over clearnet (advertisements everywhere) and diet pills kinda piss me off.&nbsp; So, seeing them on the black market pisses me off even more lol&nbsp; I dont normally just barge in and start giving everyone my opinions lol

				Oh no Everyday you didn&#039;t bother me or the thread.&nbsp; Don&#039;t feel like you should be sorry.&nbsp; I am very eager to talk about what you brought to the table and this evening I am going to delve into it a bit.&nbsp; Certainly eating meat is not incompatible with diet pills.&nbsp; And if people read the thread and decide to eat meat instead of buying diet pills, that is perfectly fine.&nbsp; I will tell you a secret.&nbsp; Western people buy a lot of diet pills.&nbsp; If you look only at the sales of clenbuterol that I have made since I started this business 13 months ago, well- it adds up to as much as a very nice home would cost in a developed country in Europe.&nbsp; Surely there is nothing you can say to stop the momentum of the diet pill.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />On the other hand, I am also very interested in health and anything that you can teach me I am interested in learning.&nbsp; I am very interested in the Inuit.&nbsp; Mentioning them got me hooked.&nbsp; I have a friend who is a macrobiotic practitioner and I also listen to what he has to say.&nbsp; He says something that always intrigued me.&nbsp; If you eat big animals, you will get big.&nbsp; People in the West eat a lot of cows and pigs.&nbsp; People in Asia eat a lot of chickens and fish.&nbsp; Am I correct that the Inuit eat raw whale fat?&nbsp; It might sound unappealing but on the other hand, we love our fatty comfort foods when it is very cold!&nbsp; Why is a bowl of chili made with ground beef so yummy when it is below zero outside and you have been working or playing hard all day?

				I think there are a lot of good points here about diet and about cardio.&nbsp; There is an old axiom that says you just need to move more and eat less.&nbsp; But for the morbidly obese it may not be that simple.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t that a bit like telling someone who is depressed to &quot;just cheer up.&quot;<br /><br />If you have a 35 or 40 BMI, the lifestyle change required can be extreme.&nbsp; The reduction in calories can be extreme.&nbsp; I think the advice to improve your nutrition is a sound one.&nbsp; But even on this thread obviously we have differing opinions.&nbsp; Can you imagine a person who is morbidly obese getting confused?<br /><br />A physician will not give Duromine [phentermine] to someone unless they have a very large amount of weight to lose.&nbsp; Now I understand that a morbidly obese person needs to eat less and exercise more.&nbsp; But as a person who is 20 or 30 pounds overweight, do you think you are qualified to judge all people who are morbidly obese and that you can tell them they just need to shape up?&nbsp; Perhaps the twenty minute walk is an extremely difficult journey.&nbsp; The medical ailments that come with being extremely obese can make twenty minutes feel like a lifetime, and can make a kilometer feel like a marathon.&nbsp; Are you sure that your situation is exactly the same as theirs?&nbsp; Why would a doctor ever prescribe a medication like Duromine?&nbsp; It is a strong stimulant, and acts very much like an amphetamine.&nbsp; Surely no responsible medical practitioner could possibly look himself in the mirror after writing a script for this drug- right?&nbsp; I mean- the fatty just needs to get off his or her lazy ass.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; And they need to eat the way you think.&nbsp; The paleo way, of course.&nbsp; Or the Jenny Craig way.&nbsp; The Weight Watchers way.&nbsp; The South Beach Diet.&nbsp; If you just eat like the Inuit, you will be thin.<br /><br />I hope that you understand that I am asking the questions in this way in order to be provacative and to elicit lively debate, but there is also some truth in what I am saying- don&#039;t you agree?&nbsp;

When I started I measured everything, no more heaping piles of mashed potatoes, No more 14oz stakes. Red Meat is 4oz and chicken is a single breast or thigh. I began eating more rice, works for the Asians and I think i understand why. Rice is a great filler with a serving size of 1cup and a calorie count of only 216 for that cup.&nbsp; It makes you feel full on less calories!<br /><br />I also started walking, a little at first a few hundred yards out and back, then as I got used to it I began to walk further. Up to 1 mile a day now. All slow and steady.<br /><br />So, fast forward 12 months I am down to 290lbs Still over weight but it is coming off. There is no reason others can not do this. No pills, no fast and easy solution. All it takes is a little walking and a change in what you eat.<br /><br />BTW, most fast food burgers are between 250 and 350 calories. The fries are over 500 calories. Just get the burger and skip the frys! For me I feel full and skip the biggest part of the calories. I go out to eat maybe twice a month now, easyer to burn the calories cooking and the food is better and costs less!

				EverydayCompanion do you think it is a concern that Inuit have a substantially shorter life expectancy (10 years less) than their omnivore counterparts?

				I wonder if it is environmental factors or a perpetuated congenital defect that reduces average lifespan. I know historically the average lifespan wasn&#039;t really much different than it is now if you take into account that the infant/child mortality rate was substantially higher. This brings down the average. I read a study that said if you removed children under 18 the life span wasn&#039;t that far off. To account for the remaining difference would be malnutrition in the previous generations. Since the argument is for nutrition, the most probable would be a misuse of life expectancy in that they didn&#039;t remove child mortality rate like more accurate studies are doing. Well not remove but keep in a separate statistic. You would have to look at the study and see what data they used for it.

				(Flax I got my T3 in the mail from you earlier this week; None crushed, all accounted for. Thanks)<br /><br />I&#039;ll agree that there is nothing better than a healthy diet, regimented exercise and discipline to lose, what I like to call, the easy pounds. That is the range of 13-20% BF on a man.<br /><br />When you start getting to competition cutting and/or work that demands a certain appearance; to get down to those single digit BF %&#039;s whilst keeping your sanity (not to mention knees intact from all the cardio) you&#039;ll need a foreign cutting agent. <br /><br />Clen/T3/Ketotifen (sans Benydryl) is a very effective and (somewhat) safe combination of cutting cycle for those that don&#039;t want to run an AAS with Winstrol. A lot of people would just recommend an ECA stack but I prefer the Clen due to its mild anabolic properties. I don&#039;t do any conventional weight lifting anymore so the catabolic effects from high dosage of T3 is not a concern to me anymore. I do strictly functional strength training and the amount of added caloric burn when compounded on the Clen/T3 stack is extremely effective for melting into great defined muscle tone. <br /><br />I do this in conjunction with carb cycling -- Drop into a ketosis state from Monday to Friday. Saturday you take in about 40% LBM of complex carbs (yams, brown rice, rolled oats, bran) only before 2pm and then Sunday you take in 60% LBM of complex carbs through out your meals in the day. Monday, Tuesday, Weds you workout and burn all your build up carbohydrate energy while only eating Protein and high fats Monday thru Friday. <br /><br />Rinse repeat. /feels good bro<br />

				I&#039;ve actually taken Clen. I had to stop because I wasn&#039;t drinking enough water and I was perpetually sick. The stuff works wonders, I have never used it with T3 and I cannot imagine needing to stack it with Phen as you will need to eat periodically in order to not roast off muscle. <br /><br />Flax&#039;s claims are true, but that isn&#039;t to say the other wisdom isn&#039;t. Everyone&#039;s body chemistry differs slightly.

				You are right- I have to drink ridiculous amounts of water when on clen/t3/phentermine.&nbsp; I take my phentermine early in the morning- maybe 6:30 or so when I have my coffee.&nbsp; By the time dinner rolls around at 5:00PM or so, I am hungry.&nbsp; I eat a big salad with grilled chicken usually- lots of carrots and avocado, plus extra virgin olive oil and vinegar.&nbsp; After that I usually have an apple and an orange or two, plus some skim milk near bedtime.&nbsp; That works out perfectly for me.&nbsp; I also do a B12 injection once per week to keep my energy level high.&nbsp; If I am losing muscle I can&#039;t tell in the gym- I am keeping my strength.&nbsp; But very true also that no two people are exactly alike- what works for one person is not manageable for the other.&nbsp; Some people get nervous/jittery with a small amount of clen but I actually like the &quot;up&quot; and the extra energy for work and play.&nbsp;
