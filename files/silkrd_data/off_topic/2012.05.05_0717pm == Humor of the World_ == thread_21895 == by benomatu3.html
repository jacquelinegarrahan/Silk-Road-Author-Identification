				I&#039;ve been reading posts from Limetless, Prawl42, and other British members and it&#039;s almost hitting me pretty funny comparing it to the humor in the US.<br />First of all, it&#039;s funnier than most of the stuff on my side of the pond.&nbsp; I think as an American I have those thoughts but I just don&#039;t say them along with many other people from my country.<br />Anyone have anything interesting, striking, etc. about their country&#039;s humor?&nbsp; I just have been really thinking about this lately...

				Brits DO have a dark sense of humor. Some of the shit I see on here would make me want to head in the opposite direction if I ever heard it IRL.

				I&#039;ve seen British sitcoms. Their sense of humor is quite overrated. They actually manage to be worse than American sitcoms somehow. And having met quite a few brits over the internet, I can say they often times mistake saying something slightly odd with being clever. Not that Americans by and large are funny, but I don&#039;t get what the deal is with British humor. Canadians are a funnier anyhow.

				Ok, sounds good too.<br />When I looked Football Factory up on Wikipedia earlier, it said Rockstar (the creators of Grand Theft Auto, etc.) made the movie.<br />You can see some similarities between the humor in the games and in the movie.

				I get the impression that many people in the US equate British humour with 1970&#039;s TV comedy- &#039;Fawlty Towers; or &#039;are you being served?&#039;. Our IRL humour is less slapstick, more self deprecating and dark as fuck. <br /><br />Some good stuff to introduce US viewers to out sense of humour: Monkey dust, Brass eye, Jam, Alan Partridge, most stuff by Chris Morris, League of Gentlemen. Some less dark stuff: Spaced, the day today, Look around you, Mitchell &amp; Webb&#039;s stuff.

				Can&#039;t really say our sitcoms are worse than other sitcoms. They&#039;re all as shit as each other. <br /><br />EDIT: That&#039;s actually a lie. Spaced is funny, Shameless is funny, Red Dwarf is funny.<br /><br />Another quality film is &#039;Snatch&#039;. Funny as fuck, but a crime film rather than a comedy.
