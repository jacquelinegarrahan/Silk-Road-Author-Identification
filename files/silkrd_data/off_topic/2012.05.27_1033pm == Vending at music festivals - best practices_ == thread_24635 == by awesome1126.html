				Like the topic says, I&#039;m looking for how-to&#039;s and pointers on how to succesfully sell things like LSD, MDMA, and shrooms at a festival without getting the shit kicked out of you and without getting busted. Surely there must be people here with experience in this area, share your knowledge!

				Ive never tried before but i guess you just need to be confident. Talk to people, get to know them and then when your ready, just change the subject a little and if they seem decent ask them.<br />But i dont think selling shrooms at a festival is as easy as some coke or weed aha, your call though.<br /><br />Locker.

				the best advice i can give u is dont stick around for the person to pull there money out and what not just tell them to get the money ready and come back through once they have it ready and then do the transaction quickly. And keep ur stash in ur pocket and if u happen to get caught throw ur stash in the crowds they cant prove it was u unless they catch u with the pills or whatever u have trust me it works most festivals have rentacops and unless its caught with u they cant do much to prove it unless u sold to a undercover.

				Look for the people that you KNOW do drugs.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; I went to Panama City Beach during Spring Break wearing a tie-dye shirt and a Rasta headband.&nbsp; Literally within 10 minutes a kid with a black eye came up to me and asked if I wanted to buy some acid.&nbsp; I said &quot;I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Did you get that black eye from selling fake acid?&quot; :)&nbsp; The point is that the kid was smart because I LOOK like a dude that does acid.&nbsp; You might also approach girls.&nbsp; Even if they have to get their boyfriend to make the purchase, the 90lb girl with tattoos, piercings, and neon wardrobe probably isn&#039;t a cop.

				Thanks guys! This is all great advice. What about location? Is it better to sell most of your stuff on shakedown street? inside the concert area? the camping area? Trying to avoid LEO as much as possible.

				From friends experience, the hardest part is getting it into the festival. But after you&#039;ve achieved this then its quite easy tbh. Just look out for the people that look wasted and like they want to buy some drugs. Make some friendly small talk and ask them questions like, what drugs have you taken before? What was your best experience on drugs? just small talk like that. If they seem interested in drugs then bingo, ask them if they wanna make a purchase. Ask them if they have any friends that may be interested too as one customer may equal many. <br />Another thing is, don&#039;t give them your phone number, as this could cause some big problems<br />much love and good luck<br /><br />EDIT: best place to sell is in the camping area, preferably at night time to avoid detection. Also dont bring them to your tent.

				If there&#039;s a campsite you can try selling it by just asking every tent if they need anything ;D

				Thanks! I have ideas for how to get everything in, not trying to be too specific but there will be a few hundred hits of paper, powder, maybe baggies, scales, etc. I&#039;m planning on packing it all in my tent when it is fully set up before I leave, then breaking down the tent with everything in it. Driving there will be safe and speed-limit will be watched closely.<br /><br />Are there any other pointers for getting drugs in/out and then moving them to the loving masses when there?

But idk that sounds pretty sketchy to me as i&#039;ve never tried it and dogs can smell out literally everything. But on the other hand ive never seen sniffer dogs at a festival. <br />Carrying them around its probably best to buy some duct tape which you can stick the baggie to your body/under armpits (wax your hairs off or this would become extremely painful + embarrassing when trying to make a deal). Or if you&#039;re only carrying a small amount then put the baggie between your penis and ball sack (sounds strange i know) but this is actually a very good place to keep shit and surprisingly stays in there very well. Also make sure you have everything prepared before you leave the tent, because someone may be spying on you! and remember to leave the tent shut whist your sorting out the drugs.

				I have brought lots of drugs into festivals in the past. To bring them in, I used to carefully open my food packaging, then put whatever I had into it and then glue the food packaging closed again.<br />My reasoning for this was that even if you were pulled aside by LE, they couldn&#039;t go through your food because that would ruin the freshness of your food. Then for added safety, i&#039;d put the package with the food in a bag with other foods, so they definitely wouldn&#039;t go checking every bag. Always worked for me.<br /><br />As far as selling goes; I used always talk to people first and try an get a feel for what their vibe is. I always let them mention drugs first. Once they mention drugs, I&#039;ll ask them what they take and if I can supply what they are looking for, I offer it to them.<br /><br />Hope this helps. <br /><br />Stay safe
