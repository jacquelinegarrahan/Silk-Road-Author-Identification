				Yes even old jagfug has some stupid questions sometimes. <br /><br />I did read the forums wiki page, and did a few searches first. <br /><br />It&#039;s just that when I hit &quot;Show new replies to your posts&quot;, I don&#039;t want to see every topic I ever posted in that has a new post. If should do what it says. New replies, to MY posts. Not to the topic I posted in<br /><br />2 months ago. <br /><br />Thanking anyone in advance for helping. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				&nbsp;Thanks ! Nice to know I&#039;m not the only one.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Just a minor annoyance. I think the one time I actually couldn&#039;t wait for an answer, I just went on that thread and deleted every post I made, so therefore there were no &quot;new replies&quot;, seems as though a &quot;stop following this thread&quot; button could be installed with ease, being that this forum style had been around for a while. <br /><br />It&#039;s also slow as shit this morning (8am NY Time Saturday). Silk Road is lightning fast. Go figure ??? -&nbsp; Maybe all the advice we give out to &quot;search the forums&quot; add to that the new newbie rule of 50 posts in the newbie forum before you can &quot;move about&quot; the road. Probably upsetting all those weasels that hide behind them. Nothing against genuine NEW members. It&#039;s a shame they have to suffer, but it was a sensible measure to deter disingenuous people. <br /><br />Well, I&#039;ll go check my other &quot;new replies to posts that aren&#039;t mine&quot;&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug

				This question came up in my mind as well... hopefully it changes somehow. Maybe they can make it so posts that are a week old dont show replies?

				I&#039;m going to bump this topic, as I&#039;m trying to figure this out. I have posted in a number of threads that I have no interest in continuing to see when I hit &quot;show new replies to your posts.&quot; It is annoying because I have to look through a decently cluttered list to find the topics that I&#039;m actually wanting to see if there are new replies in. Hopefully someone figures this out or it is a feature the mods can activate.

				I&#039;ll take your &quot;bump&quot; and add this one a month later. Keeping hope alive, that someone is actually listening to us!

So you know what that means!<br /><br />CRASH! :-\<br /><br />Hmm 4am - do I redose or go to sleep???<br /><br />Gonna listen to my body for a change and try the sleep.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug
