				I have little interest in works of fiction including both movies and books. However, I avidly study factual based information. I deeply enjoy learning about all kinds of subjects using the internet as well. But I only reserve my time for what I consider to be &quot;relevant.&quot; <br /><br />The last book I read was a police training manual. These types of books are highly fascinating to me.

				I wouldn`t say while under the influence. Its distracting and doesn`t help soaking in the words. I like sci-fi, Isaac Asimov as well as reads on evolution like The Origin of Species, The Voyage of the Beagle, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. I would like to be a naturalist someday maybe. I could read through books for hours and through nights late into the morning.

				Nice I love reading manuals too at times. Especially anything to do with physics, thermodynamics, and chemistry. But I think reading is an integral part of life in that it helps to improve educational skills and values one has and can utilize. It&#039;s a shame most people hate to read.

				I absolutely love the Dark Tower Series. I love books in general, read a decent amount. I enjoy a wider variety of books and can stay focused on certain books longer when I&#039;m high.<br /><br />Never tried reading on anything else besides acid, and when I had some 480 mcg I reached a point where I could recognize words and understand them fine but not comprehend the total meaning of sentences. So reading became out of the question and my friends and I chatted. I personally think that just means I need practice.

				Haha that&#039;s how you do it! Keep practicing until a chapter in a book brings a whole different perspective. Would be funny though if the book you were reading was an autobiography. ;D

				If your into more grounded and gritty &quot;adult themed&quot; books then I recommend Cormac McCarthy&#039;s Blood Meridian and No Country for Old Men. That book was awesome compared to the movie. <br /><br />And on a side note, a really good book too was American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. That book was fucking brilliant. ;D

				Bret Easton Ellis is a great writer.

				Being a programmer by profession and physicist by hobby I&#039;ve always struggled with imagining infinitely expanding universe; smoking weed must unlock or activate certain neural pathways because when I&#039;m really high on it, I can just lay there and imagine &quot;zooming out&quot; of the universe if you will, and I can do it for minutes at a time and imagine REALLY big things! I know it sounds weird, that&#039;s the best way I can describe it; it&#039;s really cool to me because it (weed) allows me to do certain mental exercises I totally incapable of while sober.<br /><br />Then there are Opiates! Oh dear God thank you for Opiates! Hydrocodone, HYdromorphone, or Oxycotin just makes me fucking smarter! Say when I&#039;m at work and programming, or reading up on the latest greatest revision of the C++ standard, or designing my own custom multithreaded bounded queues or thread pools, when I do any and all of it on any of the mentioned opiates I have such an elevated clarity of mind and thought it&#039;s not even fair to everyone else around (I mean I am pretty smart to begin with too :-) ). Whether I&#039;m doing work related / programming stuff, or just reading up on various shit (I go on to internet wild goose of information chases as I like to call them, yesterday I started reading a political blog and ended up, by simply looking up relevant information, on ancient Chineese torture methods and lynching / death by 1000 cuts) all information and learning just comes so much easier to me!<br /><br />So in general, on weed I can&#039;t study or work, but I can do great mental exercises. On Opiates my mental capacity appears to be highly elevated, I can focus much better for longer periods of time, i read faster and absorb information faster, and my memory works better; information is just there when i need it... Opiates are kinds of like the drug in that movie &quot;Limitless&quot; for me, except not to that high of a degree obviously :-D

				I too love the internet for the kind of wild goose chases Rush Limbo describes. In fact, that&#039;s how I ended up here! You just start on one subject, and then by looking up particular bits of interest, you then end up on another subject and so on. I find myself getting into darker subjects the more I browse the internet. Start at funny YouTube vids, end up looking up greatest serial killers of the 20th century!<br /><br />With books I can go for a year without reading one! Then I&#039;ll read four or five in a row! Currently I&#039;m reading Skagboys by Irvine Welsh, his third book in the Trainspotting series (it&#039;s set before Trainspotting).&nbsp;

				As a teenager I used to take in book after book after book just non-stop.<br /><br />But lately I haven&#039;t been able to enjoy reading as much as I used to and I&#039;m not sure why.<br /><br />I think it started when I discovered tom robbins. His books are so good that they made everything else seem like shit to me.<br /><br />Then I went to a college that was a little over my head and it burnt me out on reading.<br /><br />Id like to get back into the habit of reading and exercising before its too late but habits are difficult to change.

I&#039;ve read nearly all his stuff; to be honest I feel Mr Welsh has been living off Trainspotting for the last 15 years. Most of his other books could of been called &quot; stuff that got left out of Trainspotting.&quot; but that&#039;s ok because it was an incredible book at the time. I&#039;ve always been a big reader but I remember there being a big buzz about this book. A mate was reading it and I read the first page and was utterly gripped. I read very fast and was begging him to let me borrow it because I knew he&#039;d take weeks. He wouldn&#039;t and I had to wait for the library(no ePub torrents back then; I just got skagboys on my phone in thirty seconds!)<br />Also love Neal Stephenson, incredible imagination, his new Ine Reamde was good.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; William Burroughs &quot;junky&quot; is his best. He was the real talent of the beat writers. Fucking Jack Kerouac was a whining drunk. I&#039;d leave WBs later stuff alone, bit hard going although interesting ultimately a failed experiment. He should of stuck with the sharp prose of &quot;Junky&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As someone above said though I don&#039;t have a huge amount of time for fiction these days, greatly prefer non fiction ( science, history mostly) Read all of Richard Dawkins ( not talking about God Delusion but evolution stuff) and it blew my mind. I thought I understood evolution but &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; taught me more.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It&#039;s a sobering thought that at a rate of 100 books a year ( which I maybe used to achieve, not so much now I have kids) you are only going to be able to read 6000 books in your life. Think what a tiny fraction of the total that is! Choose wisely! Do you really have time to waste on Harry Potter?

				reading the bible, or any other holy book after the peak of a heavy acid trip is amazing.&nbsp; you see it all in a whole new light.&nbsp; in this theme, i strongly recommend reading the books that were left out of the bible.&nbsp; start with &quot;the gospel of thomas&quot;...it will blow your fucking mind.<br /><br />as for comics, I strongly recommend reading Neil Gaiman&#039;s &quot;The Sandman.&quot;&nbsp; that guy is a true mystic; the detail of the stories told in that comic series is astounding, and highly accurate from a mystical perspective.&nbsp; Also &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; is a fantastic read for anyone interested in real magic.

				Yeah I really enjoy the Dark Tower series.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only read the first 4, but the story Roland tells of his coming of age in The Wizard and Glass is just awesome, couldn&#039;t put that book down.&nbsp; I&#039;&#039;ll have to finish the series soon.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always enjoyed smoking some weed and reading, nothing better than on a sunny afternoon to just blaze up, soak up some rays and read.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also found that smoking helped me to get through university, made some of the less exciting subjects more interesting somehow, allowed me to study for longer periods of time without being completely bored.

From then on, Trevor continues to threaten retribution on Pygmy, until it is revealed by Trevor, at gun point, that his rape led him to realize his own homosexuality, and that he is now falling for Pygmy. Pygmy, who has no concept of homosexuality, attributes this to Stockholm Syndrome. This continued rejection eventually leads Trevor to massacre several students during a Model UN Conference, forcing Pygmy to kill him and thus save countless lives. A forensic autopsy reveals Trevor had been sexually assaulted, leading to the arrest of his innocent father. Prior to his school shooting, Trevor wrote a letter confessing his love for Pygmy, thereby implicating him in his rape, but Pygmy is able to obtain the letter before it can be released.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I enjoy reading something first while I&#039;m sober, and then reading the same thing again while under the influence. Sometimes I just get something different out of it, sometimes not. I also read when I feel anxious during a trip, provided I&#039;m not tripping too hard and I&#039;m still capable of reading/holding a book/comprehending what a book is.

				I&#039;ve been reading His Dark Materials books by Hughes Hallet high on weed. I found the trick to truly enjoying a book like that is to immerse your mind into the words. Let the individual words form mental images, then as you read combine the pictures into a sort of slow-motion picture (depending on reading speed). I can&#039;t maintain it for more than an hour though, but what an hour it is!

I&#039;ve read the Dark Towers once all the way through and I&#039;m working on going through them again. Its so easy to see the landscapes while you&#039;re reading. I loved those books. Even though the ending made me close my book and toss it across the room, I&#039;m well aware that was the only way to end that series. I sure wish they&#039;d go ahead with the movie and TV series plans. But its such a huge undertaking. I doubt we&#039;ll ever see those come to light. I am also awaiting the Under the Dome HBO 12 part series. That&#039;s gonna be phenomenal. <br />Now I usually don&#039;t get high and read... but to read I have to be comfortable. And for me to get comfy I like to have some opiates in my system. My legs hurt so often from my car wreck that its hard to get comfy and settled enough to read anymore. But reading does take my mind off of it sometimes. So I guess youre right, I like to read under the influence of a couple percocet. Just enough to get warm and cozy and slip into world of the Dark Towers. Long days and pleasant nights!

A text book or manual yes. A five hundred page novel though? I couldn&#039;t see reading The Dark Tower that way. Your mind already processes the words to images as you read. It&#039;s basically how your taught to read from the time you were a child. But to form a motion picture in your head from word for word is almost an impossible thing to do. Especially when the character is in thought and or when describing action scenes. Sometimes I have to re-read certain things because the action can happen too fast. ;D

I think I&#039;m missing something of your understanding of my idea, if that makes sense.<br /><br />When the character is in thought it&#039;s just like when you hear a character&#039;s thoughts in a movie.<br />Action can&#039;t really happen &quot;too fast&quot; when it becomes a motion picture, your mind should naturally adjust the rate at which you progress &quot;through the words&quot; to keep the flow of time steady.<br /><br />And of course imagining the scenes is how lovers of books read; what I&#039;m talking about is letting your subconscious handle the words entirely while you focus on the images. Of course you won&#039;t be able to recall the book word for word afterwards, but you&#039;d be able to describe it fully in your own words, and may even find yourself embellishing with details that don&#039;t affect the story but added to your personal experience, things your mind fabricated to make the scenes more complete.<br /><br />I can borderline do this with books that I just &quot;fall into,&quot; such as Stephen King&#039;s Duma Key. I had more than one person suggest that I wasn&#039;t actually reading and was only pretending to read so quickly as my eyes scanned down the page, in my minds eye I saw it playing out as a ghost of a movie, and my conscious discarded the words immediately in favor of preserving the images.<br /><br />My goal is for my subconscious to handle all of that and simply pass up a video feed - I have no reason to think this impossible or even unimaginably difficult.
