				Wehey, We got an order from a celebrity!&nbsp; I would have thought that they would have had loads of RL contacts... Its no one massively famous, but If you follow Australian TV you may have heard of the person. I didn&#039;t know who it was and I still don&#039;t think Ive seen them, But TK is a big fan being half Australian. He did some research and name, initials and address check out on-line. lolss. and before you ask, No you cant know who it is, and we have already deleted the address. <br />Do many people not ship to Australia? Is it very hard to get drugs there or something?? Why us I wonder, and why not buy IRL<br />Ace<br />

				I am quite surprised that a celebrity, even a &quot;minor&quot; one, had the balls to order online to Australia.<br />Just go online and watch an episode of Border Security and you will realise how fucking tight that country is.<br />They are also the most racist when it comes to pulling people aside at check in.&nbsp; But i guess that is because heroin and whatever mainly comes from Afghanistan, so i guess you have to be vigilant regardless of ethnic morals.
