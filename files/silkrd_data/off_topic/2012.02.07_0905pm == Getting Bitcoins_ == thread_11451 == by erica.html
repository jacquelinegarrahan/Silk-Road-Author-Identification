				Hi, <br />I&#039;m new here and wondered if there was a legit place to get bitcoins with PayPal money?<br />I don&#039;t have bank accounts because my ex bf ran up my credit and screwed me. <br />I just want a reliable site that maybe takes PayPal or something I can move PayPal into?<br /><br />Also, if i give the bitcoin address listed in my profile on SR, would the bitcoins go directly in there? <br /><br />Thanx!

				There are sites like bitinstant.com where you can do anonymous bank deposits and get bitcoins in return. If you&#039;re in a gambling mood, you can buy a greendot moneypak instead and exchange it for btc from one of the vendors here. Either way, you should use a mix like fogcore5n3ov3tui.onion to unlink yourself from your drug money.

				So is it better to use the address on the bitcoin app I downloaded to my PC and then transfer to SR when needed? I&#039;m not sure which bitcoin address to use.<br /><br />And bank transfers at bitinstant would use my actual checking account number?<br />Sorry if i seem dumb....I was in an auto accident years ago and never able to get anything since (stuck home). So this site is like a blessing to me. I just wanna do it right ya know?<br /><br />OK TMI sorry lol

If you&#039;re buying from bitinstant, they will send coins to your mtgox/tradehill account, the transfer topology would then look like bitinstant -&gt; mtgox/tradehill -&gt; sr wallet (you have to do this last step yourself, I also recommend that you put a mix in between mtgox and sr).<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=11451.msg106814#msg106814">Quote from: erica on February 07, 2012, 11:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And bank transfers at bitinstant would use my actual checking account number?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, you just walk in and fill out a deposit slip, then give the teller cash.

				In my opinion this is the simplest way (if you&#039;re in the US):<br /><br />Go to Get-Bitcoin.com and select the cash by mail option. Send them your cash in an envelope to the address they give you after placing your order using a fake return address and name to eliminate any possibility of the bitcoins being traced to you. When placing your order use the same fake name you used on the return address. Be sure to use a real, anonymous email so you can keep in touch with them. When using this payment method I just have the coins deposited straight into my SR wallet since the coins aren&#039;t traceable using cash by mail. It takes like 5 days for them to give you your coins but its worth the wait because it&#039;s so easy. I&#039;ve had two successful coin purchases in the last 3 weeks using this method. There is a 5% transaction fee but its better than what you would pay at most other BC exchanges.

				Does Get-Bitcoin.com allow you to use Tor? If you are logging into the account from home wouldn&#039;t they have your ip address?

				I personally would not recommend the cash by mail... just because of the length of time it will take, as well as with a fake return address and the sketchiness of the mail system you could end up losing money sadly. <br /><br />I used get-bitcoin until they changed banks they used and would recommend it. Now I actually use bitinstant also and prefer it over other deposit methods at get-btc. The cash deposit are super easy, and the entire process is really quick. I have coins in my SR account later that same day. I also prefer it because the fee is less than 5% and you end up paying less for the coins. Tradehill is not automatic, but get-btc charges so much for the coins you can offer above the current price to get the coins instantly on the exchange and still save money.&nbsp; I recommend tumbling for anonymity and avoid desktop based wallets for simplicity and convenience after buying. <br /><br />Bit-instant cash deposit -&gt; Tradehill -&gt; Instawallet -&gt; SR -&gt; awesomeness (especially considering how much you save compared to the SR btc exchangers!)<br /><br />Good luck!<br />- miR<br />

				I am not familiar with actual mixing services, I just mention it so I dont recommend something that is unsafe... you may have more luck searching in the security category for that topic. They generally seem to cost even more coins, and I never found one that I could verify as safe I guess. <br /><br />Some pass the coins in different increments through instawallets but I am not sure how secure this is. At least it breaks the trail up some. If you use an anonymous email address with tradehill, and tor to access both these things always, then it seems to be fairly secure. No real link to you with the cash deposit except for the camera footage at the bank and thats not enough to find you probably.&nbsp; So you may even be able to go straight to SR, esp if they tumble the coins as has been said. I also use the IW some because I dont use a desktop based wallet. I had a strongcoin wallet too which charges you 1% but seemed like the most secure at the time. <br /><br />Saw your first post this time, sorry. Glad youre getting it figure out.&nbsp; Good luck :)<br />- miR
