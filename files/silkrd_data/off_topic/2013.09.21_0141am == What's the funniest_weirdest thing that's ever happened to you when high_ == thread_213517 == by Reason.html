				OK, we have all had some shit happen while we were high...where like a minute later you think &quot;Did that just really happen or am I totally tripping balls?&quot;<br /><br />So share the tale my friend!<br /><br />Here&#039;s one to start.<br /><br />So my old girlfriend and I were getting stoned in my car parked on a remote lonely street next to a lake.&nbsp; We&#039;d just finished the joint and were stoned as fuck, and were just sitting in the car chillin&#039; looking at the lake.&nbsp; Suddenly a fucking cop car pulls up in back of us.&nbsp; Shit!&nbsp; Then this weird looking paddy-wagon police truck pulls past us and pulls in infront of us.&nbsp; Double SHIT!&nbsp; We are so stoned we could hardly move.&nbsp; Two cops get out of the cop car in back of us and start walking up beside us on either side of my car.&nbsp; They reach the driver/passenger door and stop.&nbsp; They just stand there.&nbsp; We are freaking the fuck out. <br /><br />The two cops get out of the paddy-wagon cop car and walk toward us.&nbsp; Do they think we&#039;re going to put up a fight?&nbsp; Was this some sort of sting?&nbsp; Four cops for two stoned kids?&nbsp; What are they waiting for?&nbsp; <br /><br />They go to the back of the paddy wagon and open the doors.&nbsp; There &#039;s a big cage in there...they lift it out and there&#039;s this gigantic raccoon in it.&nbsp; The two cops carry it over to the side of the lake and the other two cops step in front of my car and make stay-put signs with thier hands.&nbsp; Then they open the door...the racoon waddles out.&nbsp; They pick up the cage put it back in the paddy wagon, all the cops get back in their cars..and they all drive away after waving to us.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have been sitting there totally motionless this whole time frozen in terror.&nbsp; <br /><br />The racoon walks up to my car and just sits there looking at us.<br /><br />We just burst out laughing...WTF!!<br /><br />R.
