				So i think if i want to continue with MDMA then i have to take it once in while like once in month or once in 2 weeks something like that to get the same effect as i got first time?<br /><br />and what about addiction, how much do you need to use in how long period to be addicted of it ?<br />For sure you can be addicted just only cause you loved that feeling you get for first time but what otherwise? i mean that not your mind want to continue using MDMA anymore but the drug force you to take it, like H ?<br />

				If you leave at least 6 weeks between rolls you&#039;ll keep the magic and minimise the potential for damage of receptors. Serotonin levels return to normal after about a month, but that doesn&#039;t mean that a month between rolls is OK as you can still cause stress. Remember the four golden rules of responsible MDMA use:<br /><br />1. Try not to exceed 220mgs per roll (maximum 180mgs to play it extra safe). Redosing when your serotonin has depleted can cause damage to S receptors<br />2. Don&#039;t forget preloading and postloading regime (eg vit c, magnesium, vit B6, 5-htp (post only), Piracetum, Tyrosine, Lipoloc acid)<br />3. Hydrate, but don&#039;t over-hydrate<br />4. Leave at least 6 weeks between rolls<br /><br />MDMA isn&#039;t addictive.

				i mean. it was pretty bad like. granted i had a long detox (i didn&#039;t want to go on methadone or buprenorphine so i used DXM as an opiate substitute drug which it worked magically... but doing heroic doses of dxm every day every other day fucks your body up). i didn&#039;t have as bad of a time as some other people do.<br /><br />people injecting shit on the streets is groddy. i mean like. i&#039;ve never done something like that... i always waited till i got home but each to their own.<br /><br />yeah like all i wanted to do was hang out and talk to people and smoke weed. it&#039;s a fucking great drug for like... a lot of things. i don&#039;t think it should be used like in a &#039;i&#039;m bored, let&#039;s find something to put in our bodies&#039; kind of thing. if i wasn&#039;t concerned about like. having a heart attack or something (i thought i was going to die the last time i did coke with all of the meth in it) i would give it another go. stims aren&#039;t the thing for me personally. a lot of the e pills up here have a bunch of meth in them usually too since like 30% of the like 16-30 year old population where i live are all tweakers.<br /><br />again. mdma is awesome.

				To bad that you have to use a bunch of other drugs to quite a hard one.<br />A friend of mine he quit H, and i feel like hes lucky and all others that quit H are all lucky.<br /><br />If i know that a friend of mine is using H then i just say bye to person cause i dont know if i see him/her alive next day.<br />Even that 94% of drugs comes out of my country not much people using it.<br />they only use opiom as a medicin for pain and cough and some other that smoke it like all day long to get some buzz lol. <br />And what they use allot in my country is only hash no weed cause they think weed makes you crazy and not hash cause they think hash is more cleaner then weed since they make hash out of thc crystal and throwing weed away :|<br /><br />and oh never tryed shrooms probably will try soon but not that soon until mdma is out of my body :P<br />Im more fun of cooler drugs like weed,mdma,coca,shrooms, more of the nature creations but sadly i do not have that good economy to buy weed to smoke everyday so im sticking with synthetic canabinoids until i have good economy to be able to pay for weed.<br />Thats worse when you are not living in your own country and living in other country, in other peoples property totally alone expect my drug friends which we meet each other everyday to smoke with each other or to hustle someone :P<br />

				I didn&#039;t like snorting mdma so much but eating about 200mg was fantastic. Yea the synthetic smoke blends are dangerous as hell man. I like the jwh better then the ur-144 but you can steel feel the chems from it. It&#039;s cost a lot less tho but I just wouldn&#039;t do big dosages of that stuff man. Some people in Florida were on it and got busted for eating people. the feds are all over that shit now. they shut down a few places here when it got banned
