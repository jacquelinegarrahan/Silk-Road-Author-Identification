				Ok so I got one more PM and I got fed up so pretty much Im doing it back to them.If you want to help me go to live chat and ask if they like spam..Youll get banned from live chat.Then go to &quot;contact us&quot; and leave a bullshit name (I like shanaynay) preferably something realistic so they will think its a legit customer.Make up an email like &quot;gogogo@yahoo.com&quot; and keep putting shit like do you think spam is cute? I dont its annoying....and would you like it if I told the BBB (better business bureau about this little scam you got going here? .......Is this annoying yet? .....I can do this all day.....Im thinking about getting little spam bots like you...Please suck a dick.And so on.Its pretty much a desprate attempt to show them what its like to get spamraped day and night.If you got some time on your hands help out its pretty amusing and I bet after my 50+ messages theyre getting the hint and Im sure if a couple more people did it they would start to get pretty pissed.Anyway if youre up to it head over there and be a prick if not have a nice day!&nbsp; &nbsp; Just for shits and giggles guys! But hey maybe they&#039;ll get the point and stop!

				It should be easy to make it impossible to post the same post twice.<br />Or just ban the guy.<br /><br />The server is in the us and mtgix is registered in China. Icann has warned The Chinese company to take action within 6 weeks or it will loose its right to register.<br /><br />Maybe you should talk to the hosting server and Ddos them with Thorshammer, or just go to BMR and hire someone. For 25 dollar it should be put down. They will show for 10 minutes that they will be able to put the site down, for free!<br /><br />But SR has to make this impossible.<br />Next thing will be 10 or 20 of those fother muckers, hired by the DEA or some fundamentalistic religious rightwinged selfdeclared anti drugs warrior organization.<br /><br />SR doesn&#039;t do shit except a delete every now and then, witch will be paste back in no time!<br />They rather delete and delete then to ban the guy.<br />It has no priority and maybe SR is cashing in on the profits aswell.<br /><br />If someone knows who is responsible for this shit, I have some explosives you can send the guy, so he will loose his fingers and will never be able to use a keybord again, FOR FREE !!! <br /><br />The moderators of SR are responsible for the wellbeing of this forum.<br />And they do a lousy job! <br /><br />Step it up you guys from SR.<br />&nbsp;Improve and enhance, this forum is going down the drain!

				<br /><br />@Guru<br /><br />Very good answers.<br /><br />&quot;&quot;Yeah, right! &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Now you&#039;re being completely ridiculous! &quot;&quot; I like the most.<br />(I am just angry with this guy.)<br />Very honest too, at least I know what my options are... ;-)<br /><br />Only your first answer puzzles me;<br />&quot;&quot;Lim has banned at least 20 accounts, I&#039;ve done at least a half-dozen in the day or so I&#039;ve had the ability to do so.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />So you could ban and now not anymore?<br />&nbsp;Do you have a quota for the number of people you can ban? <br />Or just a specific subforum/section?<br /><br />Anyway, doesn&#039;t really matter now.<br /><br />Do not see the mtgix spam anymore.<br /><br />Thank you so much.<br /><br />Good job!<br />

				Wow some of the nutcases that appear from time to time!!!<br /><br />Do they not understand how fundamental the Bitcoin Exchanges are to the whole Silk Road Revolution? And that spammers have nothing to do whatsoever with Mt.Gox.<br /><br />Perhaps some of these are sent here just to cause trouble?<br /><br />Thanks to you moderators for putting them straight. :) :)<br />&nbsp;
