				So even though the vendor account has been active for a month we have only been listing items for a week or so. Getting decent volume to start with lots of orders pending in transit. Today I get a message;<br /><br />&quot;hi, i am new to SR and was wondering if you can supply me with large amounts of marijuana, because my old dealer has recently cropped out so now i cannot supply my buddys with premium buds consistently, and was hoping you could help me out! i ussually pick up around (2-5 lbs) for 24-29k per p, hopefully you can help!!!!1 i need a response ASAP because my town has been dry for weeks and demand is sky high please help!!!!&quot;<br /><br />We havent sent more than an ounce yet, and while we handle pounds locally all the time. it seems weird that a new vendor just starting to build rep would get this request. My first thought was LEO! and pretty much still is looking that way. What do you guys think?

				yeah that message does stink of pork, but why not sell to him? even if he is LEO - you&#039;re totally anonymous. or you should be. the only info he is going to get is what postal town you are sending from? just make sure you&#039;re as careful as all vendors should be - no finger prints, no DNA (strands of hair or anything etc) in there, only accept BTC, only message through SR. <br /><br />Old bill&#039;s cash is as good as anyone elses...if they think they can sting you fuck it, rob them for it. if you&#039;ve got the product and they&#039;ve got the cash. if you are that worried get him to FE or no deal, at least that way you definitely get paid. i think most vendors shipping bulk require FE anyway, or at least part FE<br /><br />if you think about it - what makes you think LE hasn&#039;t already bought from you under another account?

				Here is a tip, if you are worried about selling drugs to cops on SR you better clean house and quit while you are ahead because you are probably going to get raided. Maybe try again later after learning about security enough to make sure you are not fucked already, and then come back and try again after learning the required steps to follow to make it extremely unlikely that you will be busted for selling on SR. Buying pounds online is far riskier than selling them online if you use the proper techniques and technologies.

				So yea I think it probably is a leo. While thinking about it I decided LE could use an example of what good weed looks like. If they crack my ip they willl find one city and when they see the shipping center they will find another in another state. So being we dont leave finger prints dna and rotate courier&#039;s and drops. They will have a hard time catching the people who actually do the mail. And I think your right raoul they could just as easily bought small already. Thanks for the insight!

				hydrofarmsr, I am a new vendor as well and I got 3 or 4 like this in the first week. I had one ask if he could buy 3lbs of mushrooms. As well as the people saying they were long time SR members spending 1000&#039;s a week on SR as well as all the other BS.<br /><br />Personally, I figured they were scammers or LE attempting to pull something. I just told them I did not have it available, If I do or don&#039;t is irrelevant until I feel more comfortable with SR I am taking it slow and learning all I can.
