				I&#039;ve never met you people. I don&#039;t know your real names or what you look like. All I know about you is what you wrote that I read on my computer screen.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve been thinking about you all day. I couldn&#039;t wait to get back here and talk to you!<br /><br />It&#039;s kinda weird, I know. Its not like I don&#039;t have great friends in RL that I can have deep and meaningful conversations with. But there&#039;s just something about this place.

				I know exactly how you feel! I enjoy getting on the forums every day and talking to people I don&#039;t know and never will know.<br />I think it&#039;s all because we enjoy drugs and we can relate to each other in that way. Long live Silk Road!

				Definitely a good community here. It would shock most people who have an image in their heads of drug users and dealers as vicious thugs. A lot of the folks I know would expect the forums on a drugs website to be ruthless threats and just total chaos. Luckily for us, it&#039;s nothing like that.

				Oddly enough I&#039;ve found the same thing! It&#039;s a community of people I&#039;ll never meet (kinda the point) and never truly know, but since I signed up I&#039;ve looked forward more to talking to you folks than some of my IRL friends.
