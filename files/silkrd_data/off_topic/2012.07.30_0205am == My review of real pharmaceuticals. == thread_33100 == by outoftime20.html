				Couldnt find a thread for this so I decided to make one. First of all this guyis great at replying fast, and he gives long detailed messages. He completely takes care of his customers in every way, I could tell he was legit from the getgo. Next, is packaging. I wont give away anything about the packaging but will give it a 5/5. So, next is the product. He actually sent me an oxy 80. Those things are expensive as hell thats pretty generous! Well I chewed it and it gave me a buzz for an hour or two. Is my tolerance high?&nbsp; I felt like Id need 3 or 4 of those things to actually get &#039;high&#039;. But overall it was very pleasant and I&#039;m definitrly gonna be doing business with real pharmaceuticals it the future :D

				wanted to add my review for a good vendor from the U.K.<br /><br />he gave me a great deal with buy 3 80 old school OCs and get a old school 15 OC. the price was pretty great and until Seamus showed up, this was the only vendor i seen with the old school OCs.&nbsp; their communication was excellent and kept me informed on my package when i asked or for an important point. the package was pretty stealthy and done like a pro. only problem i had was with shipping time but as i mentioned on review, there was nothing else they could have done to speed it up. hope they can keep them in stock.&nbsp; anyone nervous about ordering from out of your country, no need. they take good precautions in their packaging. thanks again Real Pharm!

				RP is a first rate vendor and a credit to SR. Really looks after his customers.<br /><br />I&#039;m a huge fan of the SR philosophy and give max respect to anyone, vendors or customers, who operate within the spirit of SR.
