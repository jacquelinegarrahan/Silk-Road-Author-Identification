				I&#039;m fairly sure I heard recently that a movie on the invention etc of Bitcoins is in the pipeline.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also I could have just been in a drug induced fantasy world and its possible its not a memory so if anyone else has heard ? it&#039;d be nice to no my heads not entirely mush.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure The Road would get a mention in that movie.&nbsp; <br />.<br />edit: Looks like it was planned but not enough funds..<br /><br />found this-<br /><br />A crop of Bitcoin enthusiasts has launched a Kickstarter campaign to create a film about the digital currency.<br /><br />“Bitcoin: The Movie” will require a minimum of $100,000 to make (but they’ll amp up international coverage if donations reach $150-200,000).<br />“The fact that Bitcoin is relatively unknown can also act as the catalyst to making a good film,” would-be producer Andrew Wong writes. “A good Bitcoin documentary will play an important role in educating the public and helping them adopt to a new currency.”<br />The team is offering the usual Kickstarter swag for donations — Tshirt, posters, DVDs, private screenings, your name in the credits, etc.<br />Bitcoin reached highs north of $250 before a calamitous fall in April. This week it is trading at around $90.<br />Though it’s off its early July lows, the digital currency’s major problem has always been confidence. Presumably, a film would help elucidate Bitcoin’s benefits (and shortfalls) for a wider audience.<br />In a cruel twist, however, Kickstarter does not accept Bitcoin donations.<br />-<br />then this - <br /><br />“Bitcoin: The Movie”, a film about bitcoin, has had its crowdfunding page pulled just two weeks after it launched.<br />The movie, which was to be a documentary on the socio-economic impact of the currency around the world, was raising its money using Kickstarter, the popular four-year-old crowdfunding site, based not far away from the movie team’s own New York office.<br />Andrew Wong, the entrepreneur behind the movie, launched the crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter on July 16, and had scheduled the project to run until August 15, with a crowdfunding goal of $100,000. However, late last week, the crowdfunding site unexpectedly suspended the project. When Kickstarter pulled the plug, the movie had $15,896 pledged by 154 backers. Kickstarter works on an ‘all or nothing’ basis, meaning that money isn’t awarded unless the goal is met.<br />.<br />I&#039;m sure someone will make it one day.
