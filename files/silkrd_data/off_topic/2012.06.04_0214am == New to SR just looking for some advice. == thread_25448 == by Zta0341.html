				Hi SR friends, new here. I still dont know what to think, it&#039;s kind of a surreal feeling. I have a few questions that I&#039;m hoping some of you longer users can help me out with. Now bare with me because I am not tech savy by any means. Hahaha. I guess my first question is how does the whole bitcoin thing work? I have downloaded a bitcoin wallet, I dont have any bitcoins at the time (I&#039;m hoping that can be clarrified for me too) Do I have to link the bitcoin wallet i have to my account on here? and how do I get bitcoins? Can i exchange US dollars for bitcoins and if so where do you guys suggest? Secondly, obviously this wouldnt still be going for so long if it wasnt working, but are most of the user on here credible given there rating of course? I appreciate the feedback to a newbie, going to try and figure this whole bitcoin thing out. Looking forward to make a first purchase.

				hey man its hard for just one person to explain all of these things.&nbsp; i was in your shoes a couple months ago and you really have to almost &#039;study&#039; the forums to figure out these things.&nbsp; Check past threads on bitcoins.&nbsp; &nbsp;I reccomend checking the security forum.&nbsp; &nbsp;I probably researched SR and the darkweb for a month before I committed to buying anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />just poke around for a while and check past threads.&nbsp; You&#039;ll get the hang of it with a little practice.&nbsp;

				I should also point out I know very little and am still laerning.&nbsp; &nbsp;BTC&#039;s can be acquired on SR through vendors trading moneypaks or cash deposits.&nbsp; I find this the easiest way to acquire BTC but everyone has their own way. <br /><br />BTC&#039;s can easily be traded for USD through moneypak and several different banks in which cash deposits are made.&nbsp;

				Yea I&#039;ve been poking around pretty much all day reading forums on here and various other bitcoin sites. I appreciate the reply and good feedback, I will say the more I read the more answers I get to my questions and concerns.

				I recommend using the cash deposit method for bitinstant.com, use Chase and not Bank of America, they ask too many questions. At chase you can do the deposit in less than 5 minutes and don&#039;t have to leave a name. I normally use the cash deposit --&gt; Mt gox method but I&#039;ve heard shit recently about mt. gox having problems, I&#039;ve heard good things about using the coinapult option though. <br /><br />Just go on bitinstant.com, their FAQ explains it all much better

				agreed, bitinstant is the best. i had questions when i was getting my first bitcoins and i emailed their support-- got a reply immediately and this was at like 9pm on a thursday. the guy was super nice and helpful, so i gotta recommend them.<br /><br />the whole bitcoin thing made very little sense to me before bitinstant-- i still don&#039;t understand it but i understand it well enough to get what i need!

				Yea I just set up an account on Mt. Gox and I was also on Bitinstant doing some reading, once the time comes here in the next couple days I&#039;ll do a cash deposit and make a purchase. I&#039;m pretty excited to get this set up. To think I no longer have to search endlessly for things anymore. I just hope quality is good. Thanks guys I appreciate the help!

				I would avoid mtgox and use bitinstant--&gt;coinapult. Mtgox screwed me over recently. Check my previous posts for the details.

				Ok thanks for the heads up, it looks like bitinstant is more user friendly too.
