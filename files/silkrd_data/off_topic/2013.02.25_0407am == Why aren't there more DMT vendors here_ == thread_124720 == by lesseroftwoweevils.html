				Even with the recent crackdown on MHRB vendors in the U.S., it&#039;s quite easy to find the stuff going for less than $150 a kilo (trc even sells an vastly overpriced 5 kg listing on the road for $2100). <br /><br />So let&#039;s assume you buy 10 kilos of MHRB for $1500 (probably could find it cheaper if you have good connects). Even if you have a shitty .5% yield with your extraction technique, that&#039;s still 50 grams of DMT (worth almost $10,000 going by SR current prices). <br /><br />With those high profit margins, the extremely low difficulty in extracting DMT, and the relatively high availability of DMT &quot;precursors&quot;, why aren&#039;t there more than a handful of DMT vendors here?! Someone get on this please!

				Well, i see no death of DMT vendors on the road. However, the same reasons that you mention ( easy extraction process, easy availability of precursor) could be why people do not want to spend on it, and thus extract it themselves... for much less...<br /><br />This, in turn, results in lower demand.... lower market potential, less volumes, and smaller profits ( although the margins might still be good ).<br />Probably the effort is not worth it for vendors who get large volume sales from other, less profitable products.<br /><br />Another reason could be the spiritual nature of the drug. On a few occasions, during my research into this beautiful chemical, i have come across quite a few forum posts (and other articles )&nbsp; which discourage the sale of DMT ( fkc knows... )<br /><br />Just speculating here, nothing to really substantiate the above, except my memory...<br /><br />In case you are lookin for vendors, here are a few :<br /><br />JesusOfRave (has source A and source B dmt.. &quot;A&quot; is a lil more yellow.. &quot;B&quot; is also yellowish, but lighter than &quot;A&quot;, and better quality in my opinion - i have sampled both ). A bit on the expensive side, compared to other vendors, but the customer service is fucking amazing.<br /><br />mahakala (currently has 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1g listings at a very good price. Also has changa )<br /><br />Asylum (extracts it himself, very good price, but is currently on vacation till mid march. I think he sells changa as well )<br /><br />Tesser4cted (sp?) (very reasonably priced. There was one review somewhere which said that even though the pic advertised is white, the product is more yellowish, but still V. good quality )<br /><br />rogerpete - US domestic, so didnt bother researching, as i am not in the US. But he has good reviews.<br /><br /><br />then theres a few from australia.. forget their names..<br /><br />

				Thanks DayDreamer, there&#039;s a lot of truth to what you said that I didn&#039;t think about before. I guess I&#039;m just a little annoyed that I&#039;m going to have to extract the stuff myself because I don&#039;t want to pay $150 for a gram here... (hence why I&#039;d like a little more competition on the road). Oh well, I&#039;m actually looking forward to doing a little homemade chemistry!

				Where i live, DMT is unheard of.. the only people who have done it, have done so with &quot;some white guy&quot; who &quot;brought it with him&quot;, either from Europe or the US.<br /><br />The little bit that does get sold, goes for about 600 - 800 USD per gram... I definitely do not mind paying 150!!!<br /><br />But you are right, it is very tempting to try an extraction. I expect it to be a fun experience, and the satisfaction of smoking your own product is unmatched!..<br /><br />unfortunately, i am unable to find a plant in my area which i know for sure has a substantial amount of DMT.<br /><br />Still trying to figure out the local plant species... The plan is to grow my own plant, harvest it, and extract from it. I expect it to take quite some time, and in the meanwhile i will prepare myself mentally for a breakthrough... the combination of making your own product, plus he built up anticipation of the event can only result in a positive journey.. and thats how i want to do it.. My first breakthrough has to be positive and&nbsp; uplifiting.<br /><br />in the meantime, i am happy ordering dmt from the road, and testing it a bit at a time, accustoming my body to its effects , so i can gauge what to expect with higher doses. Then up he dose a bit... and repeat the process<br /><br />I went through 1/4 gm of product, 1 bong, 3 pipes and 3 lightbulbs before i managed to build myself a beautiful bulb vaporiser.. Very proud of my creation. again, the satisfaction of smoking from a vaporiser made with your own hands! <br /><br />currently almost half way through another 500mg, and i am loving it.<br /><br />It almost feels like an affair with a beautiful woman (the DMT), where i try things out, a bit at a time... I have to treat her well, else she won&#039;t give me the experience i want. Taking time to get to know her.... <br /><br />I just love it..<br /><br />sorry, went a bit off topic here.. pretty stoned..<br /><br />Peace and love...

				Haha, sounds awesome man, looking forward to trying it for myself as well! <br /><br />I have an order placed for MHRB from a seemingly legit European clearnet vendor. Once it arrives and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s legit, I&#039;d be happy to PM you the link to his site. He&#039;s selling 50g of MHRB for $17 + s/h and a kilo for $160 + s/h, so it might be worth checking out if you&#039;re planning on using DMT regularly. He&#039;s also selling mimosa tree seeds (20 for $10 + s/h) if you&#039;d like to go that route.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the extraction method I plan on using: (http://www.erowid.org/plants/mimosa/mimosa_chemistry1.shtml). I should be able to get a .5% yield, so it&#039;s by far the cheaper option.&nbsp; <br /><br />At any rate, thanks for the replies. Happy traveling!

				lot of ppl think dmt is sacred and should not be sold!<br />&nbsp;the lack of mhrb supply problem could be solved easily. some phalaris species has high dmt content!( phalaris is grass. that grows in your garden) <br />You could grow your own dmt plant!!!!!!!!!<br />
