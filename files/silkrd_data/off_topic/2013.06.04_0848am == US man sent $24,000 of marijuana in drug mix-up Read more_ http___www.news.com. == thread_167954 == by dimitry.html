				An interesting read, I wonder if one of our compadres accidentally lost this batch.<br /><br />http://www.news.com.au/world-news/us-man-sent-24000-of-marijuana-in-drug-mixup/story-fndir2ev-1226656747692<br />Read more: http://www.news.com.au/world-news/us-man-sent-24000-of-marijuana-in-drug-mixup/story-fndir2ev-1226656747692#ixzz2VEf1fuea<br /><br />IT&#039;S usually great receiving a parcel in the post - except when it&#039;s an unwanted gift like this. <br />A US man was shocked to discover $24,000 worth of marijuana in a postal pack delivered to his front porch in Sacramento, California, the Huffington Post reports.<br /><br />George Burton said the FedEx box had his name and address listed as the return address.<br /><br />&quot;We start opening it up and it&#039;s filled with that packing styrofoam, the spray-in stuff that&#039;s hard to get through,&quot; Mr Burton reportedly told News 10. &quot;We break into it, I look, and say &#039;This isn&#039;t what I think it is?&#039;&quot;<br /><br />He immediately handed the parcel over to the police, who confirmed the package contained 11 kilos of marijuana.<br /><br />Worried the owners of the drug may come searching for their lost stash, Mr Burton and his fiancee decided to temporarily move out of their home and left a note on the front door that read: &quot;Kinkos/FedEx box given to Sac Police.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m really concerned someone is going to come looking for this,&quot; Mr Burton said. &quot;People have gotten hurt for a lot less than $24,000 worth of marijuana,&quot; he said, according to firstcoastnews.com.<br /><br />While Sacramento Police said his name and address were probably chosen at random, Mr Burton had the following message for the real owners: &quot;Don&#039;t use my house anymore. Go find somewhere else to drop off your marijuana.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Read more: http://www.news.com.au/world-news/us-man-sent-24000-of-marijuana-in-drug-mixup/story-fndir2ev-1226656747692#ixzz2VEesV2gl

				This wasn&#039;t even a mix-up as the headline states. The vendor or buyer fucked up the destination address and the package was &quot;returned&quot; to the specified return address. No mix-up there.<br />Although it is a really bad idea to just use random people&#039;s addresses and potentially get them into trouble.
