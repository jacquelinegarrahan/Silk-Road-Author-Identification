				I was thinking …<br />So Obama was re-elected AND Colorado and Washington legalized recreational use of bud. That’s cool but then Obama announces that enforcing marijuana laws on people following state laws, even if recreational, was a “low priority.” So really this is signaling a big phase in the transition to legalization. I cant help but get a good feeling inside ….. I feel like the next few years are going to be an amazing step forward. I imagine more states will follow suit. I will be very proud of Obama if he keeps his word and allows states with legalization laws to enforce them without outside threats. <br />I am excited to be alive during this time and I hope that I am able to witness my own state reform its marijuana laws. <br />
