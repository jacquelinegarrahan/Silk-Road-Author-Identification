				Yeah, it may be a bit pricey, but you have to remember he/she was the first to be selling with a purchased SR seller account as well ( AFAIK ).&nbsp; Also, it is probably a pain in the ass to send international.<br /><br />If you are not satisfied with the price there are other vendors&nbsp; ( such as k23 ( abbreviated ) ) that are sending overseas for less.&nbsp; I have ordered from him myself, but have not received yet as it was only yesterday.&nbsp; <br /><br />Apparently MTX has very high quality stuff.&nbsp; I am guessing they all do as Europe is choice compared to anything you can get in the USA.&nbsp; If nothing else you could try both and post a full review of everything on your findings.<br /><br />Good luck*

				I agree shipping prices for the US, EU are a little to high. His products although are great and seem like high quality. I would think the EU shipping price is a little to high, but would be more reasonable to have the price on the US shipping as cheap as the EU ship price. Still kinda high if you ask me tho.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Peace and love

				Hi everyone! I have been getting alot of complaints about the shipping prices. Therefor I will lower them by 50%. I know this isnt 100% fair to the people who have an order wtih me right now and have already payed the shipping, so for those I will add a little bit of extra product. For the people who have their packages already shipped, im sorry, but you knew the price when you bought it ;)<br /><br />-Mitanox

				Good move! Free shipping is always good to include in your listings. <br /><br />Makes things less complicated and is smart marketing on a psychological level :)<br /><br />We have a smart and responsive seller here!&nbsp; Good work...<br /><br />The Matrix Team&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

				I can confirm his shipping costs are lowered and his packages are of the most professional I&#039;ve never lost an order from him and his &quot;orange&quot; mdma is top notch MDMA, some of the best in September so far...pretty sure he restocked the &quot;orange&quot; MDMA today.<br />I&#039;ve already placed another order for some.<br /><br />:D<br />nomad bloodbath
