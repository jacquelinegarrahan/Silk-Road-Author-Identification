				Maybe someone can help me here. A few years ago (we&#039;ll say 2004 up to 2008) in the mountain states (pretty sure it originated in Colorado), and possibly further east and west, there was quite a bit of a certain type of acid available. It was always dropped on Pez candies. <br /><br />It was a really mellow high. A really nice vibrating body high. Not many visuals but some. I loved it because I didn&#039;t feel like there were social situations that would have to be avoided like when you&#039;re really tripping on heavy stuff. Just really nice. Take a couple Pez, chill out and sip on a beer and do whatever.<br /><br />I hope there&#039;s some of you out there that were around for this as well, and maybe it&#039;s still out there somewhere. Here&#039;s to hoping.

				I lived in Colorado, Boulder to be exact and I do remember this type of acid going around, it was VERY mellow like you said it didnt make me feel like I was the only one in the world, anxiety wasnt through the roof so I didnt feel like I had to avoid everything.&nbsp; Why do you ask? Are you going back out there and want to know if its still gonna be there? I dont know about that.&nbsp; I was there last year, and when I got it, it was just a liquid and I was droppin it on EVERYTHING.

				Yeah I might be driving through CO on my way back home sometime around Labor Day. Just thought I&#039;d ask if anyone has seen the stuff recently. I hope it pops up again someday. It would be a nice variant to stock up and hold onto for a rainy day.
