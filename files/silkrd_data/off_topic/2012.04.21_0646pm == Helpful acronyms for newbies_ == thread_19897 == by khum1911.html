				Hi there, I&#039;m very new to SR and would like to begin making some purchased and building credit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been doing a lot of reading obviously and am encountering acronyms all over the place that you veterans obviously take for granted.&nbsp; Just wondering if there was some general list of less commonly used ones that take some head scratching to figure out.<br /><br />I&#039;ve picked up the simple ones, FE, LE etc.<br /><br />Thanks for the help!

				Reading is good. :D A+ for you. Be sure to read up on your vendors, stay in escrow, etc...if you&#039;ve lurked enough, you know this stuff kinda deal. <br /><br />Perhaps if you listed some of the acronyms you&#039;ve encountered, I could be of service. <br /><br />MOST of the acronyms I see thrown around are user names, DQB = DutchQualityBeans, a pill vendor from the netherlands, I believe.<br /><br />TuJ = TrustusJones, a marijuana vendor with some gooood bud, highly recommend. Pretty cool on the forums, too.<br /><br />So on and so forth, but I can&#039;t really think of anything else. o.O Lol.

				Ah ok I figured some of those were usernames :D<br /><br />Nothing specific comes to mind, half the reason I asked was just to start posting on the boards here anyway!

				DOC = drug of choice. <br />BTC = bitcoins<br />H = heroine<br />IRL = in real life<br />DPR = Dread Pirate Roberts (creator of this community)<br />SR = Silk Road<br /><br />With psychedelics you may see OEV/CEV in a post describing&nbsp; the trip. <br />OEV = open eye visuals <br />CEV = closed eye visuals. <br /><br />RC = research chemicals - MDMA, Methylone, the 2C family, LSD, ect. <br /><br /><br />Anymore, just ask. :)

				Perfectly valid observation. <br /><br />But the OP (original poster or opening post) seemed to want a key to all the various, shorthand, if you will. <br />Many of us regulars are admittedly too lazy to type out every word of commonly used names or phrases so we devised &quot;shorthand&quot; (both acronyms and abbreviations) that often confound newcomers. <br /><br />I remember my days of thinking DOC meant doctor. :)
