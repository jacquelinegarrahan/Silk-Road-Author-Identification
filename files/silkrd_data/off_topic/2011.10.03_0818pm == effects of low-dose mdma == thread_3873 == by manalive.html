				I&#039;m wondering what 10mg or something of mdma taken on a daily supplemental basis would do for a person. Would someone develop a tolerance quickly? Would they even notice 10mg? Is MDMA still neurotoxic at such low doses? <br /><br />I&#039;m feeling like this would be a really interesting experiment.

				I&#039;d like to learn more about this as well! If I&#039;m not mistaken, MDMA (and Methylone, and a few others like it) were originally designed as anti-depressants. In fact, MDMA has been shown quite effective in treating PTSD. I&#039;m curious what doses they suggest, what frequency, etc.<br /><br />Science is awesome!<br /><br />(Currently I&#039;m rolling on about 150mg of Methylone.)

				I think mdma&#039;s anti-depressant effects have more to do with it offering a therapeutic experience that can change your outlook on life.&nbsp; The studies with PTSD sufferers used full doses in conjunction with therapy sessions - mdma can be a powerful tool for opening up and addressing internal issues that you subconsciously block yourself off from.&nbsp; It is not so much what the mdma does, as what it allows YOU to do that can lead to positive changes IMO.<br /><br />But that said I have no idea what a daily tiny dose would do.&nbsp; I kind of suspect the effect would be negligible or negative.&nbsp; Personally I think mdma is best used with long breaks in between.&nbsp; There are definitely negative physical side effects, but this way they are outweighed by the positive therapeutic experience.

				It may make you a little happier and the birds chirp a tad louder the first day, but my guess it would ultimately induce depression. It may have an impact on daily serotonin reuptake and what not.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve had bouts of using too much MDMA, plus depression and SSRI&#039;s, so I also must spread out my MDMA use with long breaks or it does very little to me.<br /><br />If I were going to take a drug in small doses for therapeutic reasons no doubt it would be low dose LSD, but that&#039;s another thread all together.&nbsp; I feel it is much more relevant at low doses than MDMA.&nbsp;

				a low dose of 2C-B, IMO, would be an extremely effective anti-depressant. *really* low though...something about 5 - 8mg. i&#039;ve actually been doing some self experimentation along those lines.
