				H for sure. Why would anyone do that stupid ass drug? It makes you drool on yourself, makes you not able to move, then you get really sick, THEN comes the really nasty part next day: you feel like a train hit you.

I&#039;m not sure how anyone experiences that first time, then says &quot;Let&#039;s do this shit again....&quot; I mean of all the seriously addictive drugs (meth, coke, crack, and H or other opiates) I can understand most because they feel really good. H does not. That&#039;s kinda interesting if you look at it psychologically really... What makes people come back for round two? I wonder if some people just don&#039;t experience all those negative side effects on their first go so there&#039;s no negative reinforcement?<br /><br />

				Spice... For three god damn hours, all I could see were me and my friends I was with as talking cartoon animals. I don&#039;t think I can even explain.<br />High dose of 25i was pretty weird too. I thought people were out to get me, and I kept repeating myself. I also went to a liquor deli to buy beer and spent a good 50 minutes because I was so confused what I wanted to buy and what beer looks like... Walked up to the cash register looking like a half-dead mental case. That was a good memory.

				DIETHYL ETHER<br /><br />Such a goddamn good drug that is only known thanks to fear and loathing. Imagine it like extremely cold ketamine that smells like gasoline. Amazing stuff, nothing quite like rolling out of bed to have an ether binge. You eventually forget you&#039;re doing ether and then pass out, top notch.<br /><br />PHENYLPIRACETAM; this is so goddamn sweet, forget piracetam this is what racetams are supposed to be like. It&#039;s sort of like an improved version of modafinil with no sweatiness or jitteryness. Lifts fatigue and makes you a bit of a boss. Downside is those like me with HPPD will notice the visual effects come back in full swing...and it also makes you very chatty and great to be around. this shit should replace coffee!!<br /><br />ONDANSETRON<br /><br />i appreciate that it&#039;s an antiemetic but SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, this stuff is so outrageously important to own. Nausea gets its ass handed to it by Thor himself, hangovers, come-ups, ilnessess (less good an idea) be gone. Get yourself some for your stash already

				Man. I had a guy sit and do an entire box of whipped cream chargers and break out some ether. That was pretty entertaining until he fell and cracked his skull open and had a seizure..<br /><br />&nbsp;:o

				I took 740 mg of Diphenhydramine...... SCARIEST shit I have ever been through.&nbsp; I kept hearing some woman whispering my name, saw shit tons of demonic like people, and kept hearing groups of children laughing/screaming.<br /><br />I&#039;m fuckin amazed this is OTC,&nbsp; If you are not mentally stable and do a high dose you could very well end up hurting yourself.

				Let this be a lesson that drug people are inherently stupid.<br /><br />Me and my friends smoked a bunch of leaves in the park once. We probably should have died.

				I feel like I don&#039;t remember the salvia trips after they happen (only the last minute or so as you return back to reality), but a day or 2 later I&#039;ll have tons of memories of what I experienced during the trip. I&#039;ve had some very fun experiences, and a number that just left me weird...<br /><br />It does have kind of an &quot;unpleasant&quot; vibe, in that its so forceful, not to mention breaking out in a hot flush every time. I&#039;ve made a tincture using salvia extract, supposedly that alleviates both factors and delivers a longer, smoother trip.

				I haven&#039;t taken too many drugs. But for me at least, the weirdest was mushrooms, simply because of the incredible eidetic images, time distortions and strange mentation on high doses. I&#039;ve done DMT but very small amounts, I&#039;ve never tried to break through to the DMT room or hyperspace yet. Same for Slavia divinorum. Saw strange entities, but have limited myself to relatively low doses. <br /><br />One day I&#039;m gonna get some guts and plunge in there on high with DMT and also with Salvia, and then I&#039;ll see where they take me.<br /><br />goblin

				The only negative trip out of close to 50 i have had was on salvia, i got stuck in this horrid trip loop for close to 4 hours although i was not aware it was that long until my friends told me. Unfortunately i ruined my first time with real lsd because i was stupid enough to smoke 80x salvia extract at the peak for my first time on both substances. Nasty stuff salvia its like a unpleasant cross between dmt and ketamine with only the bad parts of each.
