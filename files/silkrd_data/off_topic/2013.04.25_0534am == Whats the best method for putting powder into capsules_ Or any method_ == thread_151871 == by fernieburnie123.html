				Before a NYE show a few years back me and a buddy of mine capped up about a quarter of molly and it was a nightmare. <br />I just realized I&#039;m about to be in the same predicament and know for sure that SR has some knowledgable peeps that have been in the game for a while<br />&nbsp; :P

				I capped my first 25 with a straw that had a scoop end like you get get with frozen drinks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cut it off to about 1.5&quot;, used a folded piece of paper when measuring and moving the powder.&nbsp; Don&#039;t have anything to compare with but it wasn&#039;t too tedious

				Yep use straw with a scoop end or cut a straw on an angle to make a scoop, then either weigh 1 end of the capsule and tare your scales to that as the same end to each capsule will weight the same, fill weigh and cap off. Or put your gear on the scales and scoop deducting the weight you want in each cap. Have fun

				The best advice I can give you is to think like a machine.&nbsp; Do all similar steps together before moving onto the next step.&nbsp; Assuming you&#039;re going for accuracy, I&#039;d say do the following.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Buy 0 caps, not 00 - they take up less space, and people won&#039;t think you&#039;re ripping them off b/c they&#039;ll look more full.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Crush your product if it&#039;s rocky, as it&#039;ll be much harder to eye-ball when there&#039;s chunks.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Find/make a tool that fits into your caps.&nbsp; Anything skinny and flat will work, but a small straw cut across the circumference of the circle works better (will look like a halfpipe).&nbsp; I like to make a point on the other side of the straw w/ a finer tip to add/subtract smaller amounts from the cap if my 1337 eyeballing skills are off.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Pull apart all the caps you&#039;re going to do, and separate into piles for top/bottom - one on each side of the scale.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; Fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap, fill, weigh, cap<br /><br />6.&nbsp; Bask in the warm glow of knowing you just made 69 100mg caps of mdma, and the rest was lost on tools/the bag it came in.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; Profit (a separate tutorial)<br /><br />8.&nbsp; Put result of step 7 somewhere safe<br /><br />9.&nbsp; Eat a hit of LSD and celebrate, b/c A. LSD is safer/more enjoyable and B. You never get high on your own supply<br /><br />If you&#039;re not worried about accuracy, skip the scale step - not gonna say I&#039;ve never done it before when in a rush before a show/mid-festival night, but I&#039;d still suggest checking one every once in awhile to make sure you&#039;re not fucking up bad.&nbsp; Sometimes I&#039;ll weigh them all after the fact, and then sort them into piles.&nbsp; +/-.01 go into the standard pile, +/-.02 go into homies/douchebags piles, and anything off by more than .02 gets recapped.<br /><br />If you&#039;re ok w/ cutting the product down w/ something and want to do it REALLY fast, get a pill filling platform, figure out how much cut you need to ad so the large half of the cap filled is your desired amount of MDMA, and get em all done in a few minutes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151871.msg1055375#msg1055375">Quote from: Fried Rice on April 26, 2013, 06:08 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yep use straw with a scoop end or cut a straw on an angle to make a scoop, then either weigh 1 end of the capsule and tare your scales to that as the same end to each capsule will weight the same, fill weigh and cap off.

				Get a plastic 1 milliliter syringe. Use a razor blade to cut off the end that the needle attaches to - now you have a small cylinder with a plunger. Pull the plunger back to a specific volume marking - experiment to find which mark corresponds to the weight that you want.&nbsp; Tap the open end of the cylinder into a pile of our powder until the cylinder is full of powder. The syringe will fit right into the capsule half and you can press the powder out gently with the plunger.<br /><br />You&#039;ll be surprised at how reproducible the weight is if you take even minimal care to tap into the powder more or less the same each time.

				IF you go poke around you can find these tiny funnels. I think I have even seen some on Ebay for less then a buck before.. <br /><br />Pick up one of The Capsule Machine from Amazon .. Load it with caps, use scale to weigh out product and use funnel to dump into cap.. <br /><br />You can cap a lot REALLY fast this way.. <br /><br />DON&#039;T use the Capsule machine the way it states you will waste product and put WAY too much in each cap.. They are really only good as a cap stand for us.. :) <br /><br />Happy capping!!

				The way I tend to do it is put a bunch of the product on a flat plate with no rim. Then I fold a reciept long ways and tar that out on my scale. Then push the powder off the edge of the plate with a knife til it hits my number, then slide it into the cap. I did this with 00 caps so only a tiny amount spilled so I was weighing out .11g per cap instead of .10. Ended up getting the caps done pretty quick this way, though it does require a semi steady hand not to spill going from receipt to the cap and probably is not the most accurate. Got the speed down to about 20 seconds a cap I think

				Ok, this is the best way if you dont have a cap machine, &quot;Cap Em Quik&#039;, etc.<br /><br />You know what silicone tips look like? Normally hardware stores let you take them for free, tradies use them.<br /><br />You grab a plastic silicone tip, there free so grab a couple to spare.<br /><br />Buy a pack of assorted plastic kitchen funnels. One of them will fit perfectly into the silicone tip.<br /><br />Just hold the cap with silicone tip slightly inserted and funnel attached, and just drop that powder in. ;)<br /><br />You will want to trim the end of the silicone tip so it doesnt go too deep into the cap. ;)<br /><br />Best thing i ever did. :P
