				I get very very scared when I watch horror movies. I don&#039;t mind violence or murder (in movies), but if anything is supernatural it scares the hell out of me. It&#039;s so bad that I can&#039;t sleep alone for days after watching something frightening. My heart starts racing, I start hearing noises and I get creepy feelings. Once I watched a horror movie when I was alone in the house and I got so scared that I had to run (I don&#039;t think I ever ran so fast before) all the way to my boyfriend&#039;s house. The only thing that helps against my fear is company. As long as I&#039;m not alone I&#039;m not scared (except when my only company is the sleeping kids that I&#039;m babysitting).<br /><br />Most of the time I avoid shows and movies with supernatural themes, but in spite of becoming so frightened, I&#039;m drawn to these shows and movies. Every now and then I will watch them. I both love and hate the fright. I suppose it&#039;s human nature. To my questions:<br /><br />1. What drug would you recommend watching a horror movie on?<br />2. Why do you recommend this drug? What can be expected when watching horror on this drug?<br />2. What can happen if I watch a horror movie on LSD?<br /><br />I guess it&#039;s probably a bad idea that I watch a horror movie on drugs, but I can&#039;t help getting excited by the thought.

				I&#039;ve watched the 2011 remake of Fright Night on Moxy (5-MeO-MiPT) once and it worked nicely :)<br /><br />Also, if you want a horror movie without the supernatural stuff I recommend you check out &quot;I Saw the Devil&quot;.

				Event horizon is a good supernatural horror, iv got a projector set up in garden, great for summer films. Drugs though i dunno, most of the time i have very little concentration when using heavy stuff. Weed is good, sets the paranoia scale to super sensitive, you will shit your self.

				If horror movies scare you that much as is, why would you try LSD while watching it? You would be terrified, and have a terrible trip .

				1. What drug would you recommend watching a horror movie on?<br /><br />I recommend lsd. it will scare the drug out of you.<br /><br />2. Why do you recommend this drug? What can be expected when watching horror on this drug?<br /><br />I recommend using this drug because it will make what you are watching more intense and vivid. you can expect a nightmare-like eeriness to the film.
