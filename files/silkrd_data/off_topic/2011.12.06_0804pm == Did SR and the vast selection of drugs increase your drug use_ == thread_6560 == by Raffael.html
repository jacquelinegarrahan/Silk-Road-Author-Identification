				I do find myself tempted to try things I haven&#039;t before.<br />Did you try or increase consumption of things you otherwise wouldn&#039;t use, just because it&#039;s so easily available?

				While I&#039;m sure the media would love to hear things like &quot;yes, thanks to SR I do many different drugs and I do them all the time,&quot; but for me it hasn&#039;t really increased my usage or diversity by much, all it did was make it safer by having a public forum in which the bad dealers with bad product were weeded out and the good dealers with safe and effective product were kept.

				SR allowed me to find LSD, which I&#039;ve loved for a long time, but can&#039;t get since I moved to this backwood town.<br />Result, my cannabis use has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY.<br />I used to smoke anywhere between 1/2 to a full ounce per week.<br />I&#039;m down to a joint or two every three-four days.&nbsp; Well, I haven&#039;t had any in over a week now, but I&#039;m dirt poor right now.&nbsp; Soooo...<br />I&#039;m saving money, clearing out my lungs, and expanding my mind.<br />&nbsp;;D

				yes and no, finding sr has upped my drug use but only because its enabled me to get my hands on stuff ive been reading about for years but had given up on any chance of ever finding them, even right down to good old pure mdma, until i found SR i hadnt had any real molly for a good number of years, so yes it has both enabled me to get some of the stuff i loved that i thought was gone to the pages of history and to try some of the stuff i thought id never get a chance to even see in my lifetime. so in short i just think its allowed me to become the wreckhead ive always wanted to be! :P oh and as Throwitup said it sure has decreased my usage of shit quality drugs and having to rely on what i can get my hands on for the weekend, i can now have what i actually prefer

				Yes. From nothing to whatever I can afford. 8)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t tried much new stuff yet other than different strains of quality weed (thanks LexieSadie) and prescription opiates, but it has brought me back to my old favorites meth and H with less risk and hassle. <br /><br />I was clean for a couple years before I found SR and moved to a new town so I lost all my connections. I&#039;d much rather order from here than get robbed trying to find what I want in the hood. Plus the quality has been, for the most part, excellent other than a couple weak batches of H. The weed selection is vastly better than locally. The higher prices, difficulty in getting btc, and shipping times reduce the possibility of getting hooked on the physically addictive stuff like opiates. That might change with Nucleo&#039;s quality gear.

				No, haven&#039;t even bought anything yet. I face the same problem I face IRL, lack of funding lol. Hopefully it does provide a good way for myself to get more bang for my buck on my budget when I&#039;m able to . Things like Roxies I can &amp; probably always will be able to get cheaper and faster down the street, but I&#039;m personally tired of dealing with the &quot;type&quot; of people who unload them. Maybe I&#039;m an elitist prick but I&#039;ve been a user/abuser of everything I could get my hands on for 20 years now and I&#039;m simply tired of dealing with addicts and junkies who have no control over themselves and become completely untrustworthy. I&#039;ve noticed a lot of people on here seem to keep their shit together and are able to let lose once in a while, instead of just going nuts with substance abuse, proving that not everyone is a mindless drop every dime they have or sell their children for their habit type of user.

				Hell yeah! It never increased my usage as my drug usage is very minimal yet SR has allowed me to experience a vast majority of pharmaceutical drugs which are virtually impossible to acquire where I stay. I still have many more things to try, which SR will gladly help me out in doing so...!<br /><br />It&#039;s just a good thing for keeping my usage down too as it takes quite a bit of my currency to be exchanged into US $&#039;s and then to BTC...Plus then it takes a minimum of 2 weeks to arrive. I love it though, the waiting is always worth the reward.

				So far? No.<br /><br />When I come home with my paycheck, X goes to the bills, Y goes to typical recreational stuff (saving for a TV, buying something on Steam, etc.) and Z goes to the &quot;other&quot; recreational stuff. It used to be I&#039;d get ~40 dollars of weed and ~40 dollars of heroin a week, but now the weed money goes to either shrooms, MDMA, or random RC&#039;s. I haven&#039;t smoked weed in a few months now, and I intend to try dozens of substances on here.<br /><br />Depending on how the next few weeks go, however, I may start reselling things I find on here, so my practices may change a bit. Having more options and being &quot;closer&quot; to larger amounts may prompt me to use my substances more often. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a bad thing, as long as it doesn&#039;t affect my job.

				I can say that it hasn&#039;t increased my drug use. <br />Ive done almost everything that&#039;s offered here anyway.<br /><br />Although it is constantly tempting to try newer products and some things that have the potential to be &quot;better&quot; or a little &quot;different&quot;.<br />The main issue for me is finding good trusted vendors. <br /><br />Increased drug use: NO<br /><br />Increased Variety: YES!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve just found that I&#039;ve got to try a few more exotic substances. I&#039;ve probably actually used less drugs since my time on the site. <br /><br />The product you find on here definitely seems to be better quality than what you can find on the &#039;street&#039; (you certainly don&#039;t get to look at a random dealers feedback before you buy off them!)<br /><br />The one thing I have found myself tempted to do is try heroin since joining the site - I&#039;ve used the full gamut of other opioids, and have never found myself heading down the path of addiction. I&#039;ve just never wanted to ask my regular hook ups about scoring some lest I get judged by my mates!

				i wish SR was around a few years back when i was really into coke.&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the main reasons i quit coke was that it was so hard to find quality product.&nbsp; I got fed up with paying tons of money for fillers to shady dealers who would just sell me baby laxitives to increase their profit.

				Overall, I would say drug use is about the same.........but the use of single substance is way down.&nbsp; I find myself doing a small amount of a variety of substances.&nbsp; Definitely doing a lot less (Never) low quality drugs.
