				I agree you definitely need a vendor&#039;s account, I think that fee really help&#039;s show those who are really serious about this and run&#039;s things the way they should be always!Seriously be smart, don&#039;t ever set any kind of deal on line not even with someone you seen in fourms only not a vendor, unless usually you want to loose your money! Post deals you have listed once you have an account on SR I try to post something anytime I added or changed something!&nbsp; Never buy or even look at offers unless they are a listing on SR and no finalizing ever until you get what you paid for. Vendor&#039;s on here are pretty good for problems and even get better help here than you would somewhere in your town in person! That&#039;s my opinion which changed since the first time I ever seen this site. Once you really see how organized and set up with currency held in escrow until delivered and satisfied, There could not be anything as remarkable as SR and hope everyone use common sense at all times when using the system. Don&#039;t you feel that this is by far the most organized and suscessfull underground site&#039;s, but not to limit, I have seen enormous amounts of website&#039;s that are just not put together with the very appealing, simplicity,anonymity,and just piece of mind you get. I stay domestic but 2 international orders from Africa and believe it or not,Amsterdam, BIGGEST red flag for outgoing international mail but both arrived and very reasonable shipping times. I have had every order arrive also as a buyer. Well everyone has the choice, I feel my opinion help&#039;s to open more people&#039;s eye&#039;s! Thanks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pharmacare<br />Oh yeah, The first post which I commented on said even in other post about people sending (foolishly) money for $25 coke outside SR,&nbsp; &nbsp; if he is good, the first amount $25 think it said, he would fill! Then most people would feel more trust for him then! Then he hit&#039;s you up for bigger and more money which you have to send first and unsecured which could be a few hundred now, some cash out there and disappear, but there are some that go for more and send what you paid for, then I am sure the horror stories begin.&nbsp; I guess some people fell for his game so can&#039;t blame him for the talent of hustling! lol
