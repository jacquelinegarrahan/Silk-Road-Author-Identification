				If anyone has any funny, scary, or interesting stories related to creation of drugs then I would be glad to hear them.<br />3rd party stories allowed, subject can be anything from how to avoid getting caught to &quot;here&#039;s a trick I learned when cooking -blank-&quot;, to &quot;this one time -blank- happened...&quot;, substance involved can be anything from moonshine to meth. I don&#039;t care, I just want to hear some stories

				Just because something is legal to acquire doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re off the hook. Make sure to look at what&#039;s under the DEA precursor watchlist and NEVER buy suspicious chemicals together with the same name/address/credit card #. Many people have made this mistake before and received a knock on their door by law enforcement.&nbsp; <br /><br />The biggest culprit here is Ebay/Amazon, which will give up your past order information to the feds if asked to. A better option is a small chemical supply shop. Even better is dealing in cash off the net. <br /><br />You should also become intimately familiar with the science behind your desired synthesis/extraction, which will help increase your % yields and potentially save you from getting a pair of handcuffs slapped to your wrists (be aware that there are many precursors you can make from less-suspicious chemicals).

				+1 for the solid advice Lesseroftwoevils : )<br /><br />When I was a young lad, I had a hobbyist interest in chemistry (I wanted to be self sufficient rather then buying from dangerous criminals) So I decided to do a plant extraction. I lost $1200 because I confused the phrase chemical resistant (PH meter) with chemical proof. I quickly had a solution of my DOC...and a bunch of green plastic. I gave up there and then, after deciding it wasn&#039;t worth all the time money effort and risk. <br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY: Be prepared with all the necessary tools, don&#039;t skimp on quality for important things like a PH meter (Metal probes are the way to go!), and have your workspace organized and free of distractions, like friend, neigbhors, and pets. : D<br /><br />I&#039;m so happy I found the silk road, or I&#039;d probably still be tinkering away, undoubtedly wasting $ like I did before. ^.^

				One thing that seems to work for me (no cops so far) - if you like to do / sell something you can grow (weed, salvia, B capii, psychotroia (or chacruna - can&#039;t spell worth a damn), have a house-full of plants. Same with chemistry - need sep funnels? make your own biodiesel (you&#039;ll need a diesel truck or car, which is a mighty big added expense) you can use (say that you use) the same labware.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />1: The pigs won&#039;t care &amp; bust you anyway (always possible, fuck da police)<br />2: getting biodiesel in your speed or crack or whatever you&#039;re making<br />3: Having insect pests in your house because you&#039;re growing rain forest plants inside in the winter<br />3B: Having your own ecosystem in your house &amp; it gets out of hand: gnats, leafhoppers eating all your plants, so you get a few praying mantis-es to eat the pests. No, the mantises won&#039;t stay with the plants all the time, neither will the pesty bugs. Sometimes the same with the plants / fungi especially. <br /><br />3B can be really amusing - being stared down by a mantis, mushrooms popping up on books...

				These kind of stories are very incriminating I don&#039;t think we will see many of them unfortunately.

				Back when I was trying to be a chemist. I was synthing jwh 018 and 073. When I went to make the herbal mix I was mixing in the acetone, in my room. Bad mistake. I went to sleep that night with an open jug of acetone. I woke up in the middle of the night fucked up and I mean FUCKED UP. My room stank like acetone. It took forever to get that smell out.<br />I figure I&#039;m lucky I didn&#039;t kill all of my brain cells.
