				If you&#039;re planning on leaving the country that the incident occurred in, be sure to check with a lawyer / solicitor before you do about the statute of limitations for your particular charge in your country. If you&#039;re going to be tried for importing, selling etc. then I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re being tried on indictment, and may be facing a charge of drug trafficking. In many European countries there is NO statute of limitations on charges of drug trafficking / possession of drugs with intent to sell or supply over a certain value. This means that no matter how long you leave the country for, your charge will still be active when you return, whether it be 3 years or 30 years.<br /><br />Pay a solicitor / lawyer for a consultation - once you&#039;ve paid them you&#039;ve activated lawyer/client privilege (the scope of which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so don&#039;t bare all or implicate anyone else) and you can tell them your story - what you were caught with, the amount, and the street value that the cops have attributed to it. Obviously you won&#039;t tell them that you plan to skip bail and leave the country.<br /><br />They&#039;ll be able to advise you on whether your charge carries a statute of limitations or not. If it does, excellent, you can lay low for X amount of years and return once it&#039;s over. If not, then be prepared to assume a new identity, cut all ties with friends and family, and be sure never to appear on a social networking site of any type. A LOT of people &quot;laying low abroad&quot; have been caught because a picture of them appears on Facebook or some other such social networking site. Even in clubs with photographers, you may be caught in the background, that picture will then appear on their Facebook or website and someone may recognise you. It&#039;s a lot harder to disappear successfully these days than it was 20 - 30 years ago.<br /><br />Ensure that you travel to your new destination by bus / rail whenever possible, discreetly disguised and NEVER with your real identity documents on you. Post them to your new destination if possible. Go somewhere that you&#039;re going to blend in easily. Ensure you speak the local language / dialect fluently, and have a back story that you stick to rigidly and can back up with professional-grade doctored documents if necessary. NEVER stray from this back story and keep your body language in check when lying to people, be they new friends or authority figures. Reveal your past to no one.<br />All of the above may seem like common sense but it&#039;s very easy to slip up when you&#039;re trying to assume a new identity.<br /><br />Take care of yourself mephfreak.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /><br />(In response to your new reply, a new seller here &quot;fullfrontal&quot; offers passports printed up from official blanks. They&#039;re most likely stolen and will show up as such if checked, but would be handy for boat / rail journeys and the like. He offers Latvian and Lithuanian passports and various EU identity cards. As a new seller he has to stay in escrow until he has 35 transactions so placing an order with him should be 100% safe.<br />NOTE: I&#039;m not vouching for his products or services as I have not yet used them.)

				You&#039;re gonna need to drop a few grand if you want to pull this off.<br /><br />I&#039;d say, get a fake passport/ID first, but first cut and dye your hair, grow a beard/moustache if you don&#039;t have one, and get a new photo. Then get the photo into photoshop and change the distance between your eyes/nose ever so slightly.. and get the ID with a photo of that. Then go underground for a couple of months, and then leave the country. Preferably by rail.. Get all your money into cash/bitcoin. Use the cash to get to your final destination (somewhere like morocco).. but keep a USB with your bitcoin wallet on you so you can open a bank account in your new country and immediately sell some coin to get some cash balance there. <br /><br />If you&#039;re in morocco you can buy hash on the cheap and sell it on SR (its like a couple dollars per gram)... this will be a good way of making some cash whilst you&#039;re there. Then wait for the charges to expire (if they will), and eventually return back into the country under your fake identity, and then resume your old life under your real name.

				Also if you go to places like Morocco and Tunisia there is a high level of corruption there so you will be able to get the necessaries to open a bank accounts, national insurance, residency etc. You should NOT go to any country within the E.U because the levels of corruption just aren&#039;t high enough to make this a relatively easy task. These things should be your number 1 priority as soon as you get there, the sooner you assimilate into the system of wherever you go, the sooner you blend into the crowd and that will make assuming a new identity much easier.

				Does anyone have any tips on how to get a new identity in the UK?<br /><br />By that I mean.. how would I go about getting a LEGIT passport from the government, under a new identity. What sort of documents would I need.. Is it even possible?<br /><br />I&#039;m not on bail or anything but I&#039;d like to have a backup that I can immediately put into operation should anything go wrong.

When you don&#039;t turn up for your court date they&#039;re going to be onto your finances swift as. Get that shit into cash/bitcoin as soon as you can. Either that or withdraw cash and get a friend/someone you can trust with your life to hold on to it (don&#039;t send it to them via bank transfer.. that will give the game away).. and then get them to send it to your South American bank account at a later date.<br /><br />Whatever country you&#039;re going to, check the extradition policy with your country as well.

I spent a long time there trading diamonds as a lad and as soon as people heard my accent they asked to take me out for a drink so they could practise their English - it soon became clear to me you can live like&nbsp; a King in this manner!<br /><br />If you want to go to South America I suggest you simply get a job on the cruise ships - you might have to do some work in hotels for a while to build you experience up but the staff are allowed to disembark when off duty so you can hop off at any point you like. I have some experience with this sort of thing if you need a few names.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
