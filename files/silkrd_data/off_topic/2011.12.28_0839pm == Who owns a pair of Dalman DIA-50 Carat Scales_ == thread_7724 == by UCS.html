				Hi , <br /><br />I just got a pair of Dalman DIA-50 Carat Scales , and I want to know if mine are broken. As soon as I got them out of the box I went to calibrate them using the included 10g weight. However , the scales never stick to 10.000g , they consistently jump around and rarely fixate on a single 3 dp number. <br /><br />Just wondering if anyone else had a similar or the same problem ,&nbsp; that can help ,&nbsp; or is this what happens when I buy cheap scales?<br /><br />Thanks

				On my experience all those cheap scales are pretty inaccurate. Two month ago I got high grade worth $2k scale (cost me $400 ) and it amazed me how accurate that thing is.<br />With those pocket cheap scales always use new batteries, calibrate it often and until you got best calibration possible. They often have better precision when weighting in the range around 50mg-500mg and above that start to give lower precision, but this depend on what model and brand scale you have.

				be sure your phone isn&#039;t too close to it, that there&#039;s no dust on the edges, that there are good batteries in there (not dollar store brand)<br /><br />i have a ct scale with no brand name. it&#039;s a 20g max but i never use it for that. cost me about $25 shipped. i never use it for anything more than a gram or so, usually far less, like points. never had any problems, stays in its case for the most part and never leaves home.<br /><br />some scales just suck though, get a new one if it&#039;s an issue, like any tool, they pay for themselves.<br /><br />
