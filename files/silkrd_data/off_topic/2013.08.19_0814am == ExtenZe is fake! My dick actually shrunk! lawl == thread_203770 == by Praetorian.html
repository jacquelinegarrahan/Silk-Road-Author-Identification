				Whatever the fuck that shit is called; those commercials / infomercials are infinitely annoying.&nbsp; But, does the shit work?&nbsp; They make all these claims that &quot;millions&quot; of men take their dick-pills, and &quot;millions&quot; of women are happier due to this(rofl).&nbsp; I would imagine, and always assumed it would a crock of shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has anyone in a drugged-up stupor ordered that shit? Did you try it out? Any difference??<br /><br />Half the girls I&#039;ve slept with would get sore the first couple dozen times we&#039;d fuck, and I often have heard things indicative of that I am NOT a candidate for this stuff. Even a hateful ex girlfriend once told me &quot;the only thing you have going for you is your dick&quot;, so for me, if anything... I feel that IF these did work they would only make my sex-life difficult.&nbsp; <br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read / heard... there are a lot more teenie peenies out there than not; which probably has something to do with this stupid commercial having been on the air so long.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fess up fellas... whose tried it? And did it make your dick bigger? or are you a late-night infomercial sucker? <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those fucking actors in the commercials are TERRIBLE.

				If you really had a big dick you wouldn&#039;t be asking about a mystical product that could make it bigger now would you?

It doesn&#039;t affect my standing on Silk Road. <br /><br />My penis is 7 and 1/4 inches long, with a circumference of 5 and 1/2 inches, tapering off slightly just before the &quot;head&quot; ... Not that you needed to know that, but it&#039;s the honest truth.&nbsp; And being that no one knows me, or can see my face, I am not ashamed to say that to you here.<br /><br />I am white(I think).&nbsp; And from what I understand, most of the white guys out there are packing a 6 or smaller(usually smaller).<br /><br />This thread was inquisitive.&nbsp; And solely for the purpose of knowing if those things were real or not.&nbsp; I would imagine if they were real, they would work on everyone ... not just men with small penises.&nbsp; I think a great deal of MEN, regardless of size, would be intrigued by that, no?&nbsp; A great deal of WOMEN however, would not.&nbsp; Cause then everyone with a small pecker would be as Cocky as me(pun intended), and everyone like me would be a god damned midget&#039;s arm holding an apple!&nbsp; <br /><br />In a handful of cases where I fucked around with a girl who had &quot;seen it all&quot; so to speak, she said there are some downright freaks-o-nature out there, but it&#039;s so unpleasant the first time; HUGE dicks are a turn off.&nbsp; Even I struggle.&nbsp; I couldn&#039;t really imagine having s 9-13 inch cock, especially a thicker one. <br /><br />Oh well.&nbsp; I now know it is fake; so does anyone who has read this thread.&nbsp; BAM.
