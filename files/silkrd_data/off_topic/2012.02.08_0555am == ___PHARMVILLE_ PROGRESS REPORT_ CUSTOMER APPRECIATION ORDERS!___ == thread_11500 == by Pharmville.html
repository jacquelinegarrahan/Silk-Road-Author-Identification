				Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Wow, I have to say it again...WOW!&nbsp; Well, I just wanted to give everyone a &quot;heads up&quot; about what&#039;s happening over at Pharmville with the HUGE number of customer appreciation weekend orders that we received.<br /><br />On Monday we shipped all the Express Mail and Priority mail orders that were in-house and about a third of the First Class orders.<br /><br />Today, we again shipped any *new* Express Mail and Priority Mail orders and a little more than another third of the remaining First Class orders.&nbsp; In fact, the oldest orders left still show *two days* left on them, so we are hoping and planning that if we don&#039;t get *too many* new Express Mail and Priority Mail orders overnight, that we will finish shipping all the remaining orders from the weekend PLUS all the new First Class orders that have come in since then.<br /><br />Honestly, it is a daunting task and I&#039;m not sure we&#039;re going to be able to do it, but I want you to know that Ben and I are working nearly around the clock to get those orders out to all of you as fast as possible.<br /><br />We thank you for your patience and we&#039;re sure that when you do receive your packs that you&#039;ll all be very happy with the products.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks again for making the Customer Appreciation weekend such a great success!&nbsp; We hope all of you got everything you wanted and each of you saved a TON of money in fees and discounts!!!<br /><br />&gt;Alex &amp; Ben&lt;<br />

				Hey Pharmville, I was just wondering If I placed an order for First Class shipping on Monday night, do you think it would get here by Friday? Maybe you can answer my question and then maybe a lot of other people won&#039;t need to ask it. Thank you again for the business. :D<br />-euler

				Pharmville is a top shelf, in the 1% of vendors on SR. I&#039;ve done over a dozen transactions with them and each has been excellent. They are my personal favorite vendor. Great communication also. <br /><br />You can&#039;t go wrong. These guys are seriously awesome.
