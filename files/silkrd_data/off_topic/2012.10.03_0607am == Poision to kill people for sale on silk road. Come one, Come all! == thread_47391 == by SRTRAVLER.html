				so i just saw a listing for Pure Potassium Cyanide in the GHB section.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ya, this stuff is used to kill people.<br /><br />I like the thought of being able to buy something that i can use to kill someone so easily with,&nbsp; but should it really be for sale on the road?

				You&#039;re an idiot. 90% of drugs sold here can kill you or anyone else. Buy a bag of heroin and inject it into yourself all at once and see how harmless it is. There are more uses to cyanide than &#039;killing people&#039; and he even went out of his way to explain some of them.

				And something positive comes from selling illegal drugs here in the public&#039;s eyes? This whole website is hated as hard as it can be hated. It&#039;s an &#039;Anonymous Marketplace&#039; not an &#039;Anonymous Drug Market&#039;. You can sell other things than drugs here and I don&#039;t have a problem with that. You act as if the only way to attain cyanide is from this website.

				I understand where you&#039;re coming from. And yeah in the end it&#039;s DPR&#039;s decision, but it&#039;s just another one of those things that makes this not the open market it&#039;s made out to be. People sell lab supplies, precursors and synthesis manuals; so like I said about PCP; it&#039;s a needed chemical in it&#039;s synthesis. It&#039;s a shame that&#039;s toxic and can kill others, but there have been cyanide-related homicides before this site was made. It&#039;s really not as commonly used as you think it is to &#039;kill people&#039;. It&#039;s just one of thousands of toxic chemicals that gained a bad reputation from I don&#039;t even know where. I can&#039;t think of a story about mass cyanide poisoning that would put that thought into yours or my mind. I can understand anthrax as it&#039;s been used in biological warfare before even if it was just sent through the mail to congressmen or whatever it was a short time after 9/11. As far as I know there is no other use for anthrax other than being destructive so I don&#039;t see why it should be sold here since it only does harm. But I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing other regulated chemicals sold here as it would enable more clandestine laboratories for &#039;rogue chemists&#039; and more/cheaper drugs since you wouldn&#039;t have to rely on higher ups. I don&#039;t plan on buying cyanide, but it&#039;s just not fair to say it has no other use than as a weapon.

				Please dont sell this!<br /><br />I have studied and people do buy suicide kits online, but the morality of selling a substance which is one of the most well known and effective fatal chemicals in the world is a worry.<br /><br />Sorry if there are other uses for cyanide but it would be something terrorists might use if you thinkj it through.

				You&#039;re against suicide? On the &#039;dark net&#039;? The last frontier of personal freedom? Is your stance on drugs &#039;Why should the government have control over what I put into my body?&#039; Yet you&#039;re not okay with people putting cyanide into their bodies and don&#039;t think it should be allowed? Give me a break... Terrorism... The biggest scapegoat to ever exist. You can&#039;t live your life in fear and sacrifice your own freedom for a small chance at staying safe.

				If the armory was closed down, surely things like this should be forbidden also?&nbsp; I think selling cyanide is worse than selling guns, at least with a gun you can use it for home defense.&nbsp; If some nutter goes and kills people with cyanide and is caught, and the cyanide they used gets linked to SR, I think it would be just as big a shitstorm as if some guy bought a gun off the armory and went on a killing spree.

				The Armory closed down because it wasn&#039;t being used. No one but disarmed Europeans and underage kids need to buy guns on the black market when you could just buy it at Walmart for half the price in 30 minutes tops.

				i heard cyanide tastes of almonds by one of the few people to ever provide a quick description before he popped his clogs. i think its quick but probably not painless. and i believe a free market should be exactly that, but like someone else said it would be devestating if some contaminated his drugs sales

				I actually reported this listing to vendor-support a week or so ago, when I first saw it. They responded to tell me that they messaged the vendor to remind him/her to emphasize the jewelry-and-such usages of it, and that because it had such a use it was still allowed.

There&#039;s a massive, untapped market in the electroplating hobbyist community just waiting to be taken seriously, and as a electroplatophile myself, I will not stand for your slander.<br /><br />So what if there&#039;s a few rotten apples who want to kill themselves with beautiful KCN. I can assure you that our desire for acquiring cyanide FOR LEGITIMATE USE rivals that of the most hellish heroin withdrawal. We Gold hounds need our fix, and emerald&#039;s listings have brought hope back into our once-dead community.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had a few talks with Entomologist friend of mine and she said there&#039;s a similar excitement taking place in Bio labs the world over. Finally, they&#039;ll be able to make their own killing jars for themselves and without big pharma&#039;s approval! Hey corporations, I predict there&#039;s gonna be a LOT of science going on in the future and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it! <br /><br />Check out my cyanide review thread here: <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66664.0<br />See any comments about suicide?

				Cyanide is a really bad choice for suicide, it is a slow an agonizing death. The 5 minutes it will take to kill you will seem like an eternity in hell. And if you are thinking of poisoning someone with cyanide, its just inhumane. I wouldn&#039;t wish that to my worst enemy. Remember what goes around comes around. There are much more effective and faster poisons readily available. Cyanide was unjustly banned because it was made famous by movies, books, etc. On the other hand, it has a wide range of useful industrial applications.<br /><br />

				honestly most of the shit on here is highly illegal. doesnt matter what its used for. there is nothing good that comes from almost any sales on here. illegal is illegal. i dont see varying degrees of worse kinds of illegal goods its just all bad in the public eye. my friend is in prison for life cuz he sold another person i know heroin and he died. i would bet my life that someone has died from drugs they bought here. not letting someone sell syanide is stupid in a supposedly &quot;free market&quot;. you dont have to buy it. but to me syanide, heroin, whatever its all equally illegal to me. its not gonna change public opinion or recognition of this site in any recognizable amount.

				It has limited organic chemistry applications (when I say limited I mean limited in the synthesis of drugs).<br /><br />But otherwise it&#039;s a poison (and a torturous one at that) and I don&#039;t believe it should be allowed on SR if SR stands for non-distrbution of item&#039;s solely used to cause harm (that is why the armory was moved wasn&#039;t it?).<br /><br />I hope something is done about it (removing it!) but sadly don&#039;t believe there will be :(

				There is only one synthesis I can think of that uses cyanide to make drugs. This is from benzyl chloride/bromide to benzyl cyanide. <br /><br />But there are also other beautiful reactions with cyanide.

				As someone stated before, who says what you can and can&#039;t sell. <br />It&#039;s not the product, but what people do with the product. <br /><br />SR was set up as a free trade route. So to prohibit the sale of the completely legitimate substance, is that not starting to circle in our freedom here?<br /><br />The sale of stolen items is prohibited because it is against the ideals of free trade. <br /><br />But who is going to take a moral stance in the deep web on what a substance is notorious for?<br />If you do, you need to seriously rethink why you are here and assess your boundaries. <br /><br />What H is only ok because you can smoke it? but Candide is not because it can kill you? H can kill you, its just not notorious for it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really know where I was going with this...
