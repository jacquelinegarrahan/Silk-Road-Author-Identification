				I know this is my first post and asking for information like this immediately seems strange, but hear me out.<br /><br />I tried to sell one of my computers over craigslist a few months ago (mar/apr), because i needed the money at the time. I listed it for $850 including all peripherals (speakers, kbd, mouse, monitor), it would have cost $1100 at the time to build the machine with Windows 7.<br />This man emails me about it, wanting it for his son, and we talk for a few days about it until i actually meet him. I never got his phone number, he always dodged the question or ignored it (stupid me). <br /><br />Reluctantly, i agreed to accept a personal check for it, because i was in a hurry to sell it i was willing to take what i could get. He met me at my house and i handed off the stuff (but forgot the subwoofer, i still have it, haha) in exchange for the check that he wrote in front of me.<br />A few days later it turns out the check linked to a closed WaMu account. He bullshitted us (me and my father) into thinking he was going to meet us with cash, but he was demanding that we return his original check (that we put into an ATM) and would not settle for a copy of the bank statement. After a couple days of arguing over it, he stops talking to us and we file court papers.<br /><br />In September we finally get a date for court in the mail, but a week later we get another one, pushing our date back into october saying that the letter they sent to the guy that &quot;bought&quot; my computer was returned because the address that was on the check was ALSO bogus.<br /><br />So now i&#039;m stuck with a bogus address, a bogus check, likely a bogus name, and no computer, no $850.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking here because i don&#039;t really know where to go for this, the authorities are not doing anything, despite multiple attempts to right this wrong.<br /><br />If anyone can help me find this thief so i can finally take him to court or just civilly get my shit back (Don&#039;t worry, i&#039;m not going to do anything crazy), i would be extremely grateful.<br /><br />This info is all i know off the top of my head and some or all may be bullshit, but if you need something more specific just ask. I have all of our exchanged emails, a bank photocopy of the bad check and a parts list of everything in the computer.<br /><br />His email: stillshining1@live.com<br />name: Jeffery Ellison<br />address: (Note - this address is the most likely to be totally bogus)<br />7455 France Ave S. #142<br />Edina, MN 55435<br /><br />Jeff is about 6 foot to 6&#039;2, black hair, looks about 45-55 yrs old, has a bit of a gut and is probably 220-275lbs, i believe he has glasses but he doesn&#039;t wear them all the time, i saw a glasses case in his pocket.<br /><br />He came to my house in a Dark Red mid 2000s Ford Taurus with an old man driving, i didn&#039;t get a good look at him or the license plate (stupid me, yet again!)<br /><br />All i want is his address and/or phone number so we can take it to a judge, or talk to him directly. Thanks for reading.

				So, you&#039;re checking SR forums for a private investigator?<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />And if you do find him just remember the patella is not the strongest bone in the body ::)

				sorry to hear you got jacked<br /><br />best thing to do is give the courts and police his email address and the website and a link to the buyers profile they can work out where he created his accounts<br /><br />that in mind don&#039;t forget craigslist is so dodgy police are gonna wana question you for using it instead of ebay or amazon<br /><br />hope you get the guy, if i found him i wouldn&#039;t be telling no law enforcement about him put it that way

				It&#039;s been over 6 months now with no word from the police and no effort on their part of doing anything, I have to try to take part of it into my own hands sooner or later.

				This thread is a prime example of why I am against supporting a &quot;Thieves Market&quot; that was mentioned on another thread.<br /><br />This is a horrible thing to have happen to you and I am sorry for your loss. The price of not having to deal with this douchebag any more was $850. I would pretty much go with BlackOps and say you better just get used to the fact that this guy conned you and move on to bigger and better things. Stressing yourself about $850 is not worth it.<br /><br />I was scammed out of $3.2k by &quot;a friend&quot;(he was playing middle man and claims the guy he gave my mushrooms too did a runner... bullshit)!! Needless to say that is money I will never see again and now I pretty much don&#039;t have any dealings with this guy unless its cash upfront.

If LE gave a fuck about it they could always get IP address tied to that email dude probably didnt use proxies.
