				About to place an order and I realize all my estimation and market fluctuation has left me about 0.25 BTC short of my order with the unexpectedly high shipping cost of almost 2 BTC. Anybody that wants to save me time of asking the vendor to make me a custom order will be thanked immensely. I&#039;ll pay you back next time I reup on coinage as well :D. Please and thank you community.<br /><br />ADDY: 1LppDc9MSfNXU3c3ZZ7ZWvEwRpf4cEWJ3z<br />-euler

				I tried to cover you but, I&#039;m having fits trying to login and stay on SL.&nbsp; They must be having some problems because every time I try to change pages, I get a time out error.&nbsp; I spent a 1/2 hour trying to get to my account page and never did succeed.&nbsp; I&#039;m also wanting to make a purchase before the Bitcoins start fluctuating but, it seems a lost cause for now.&nbsp;

I have my account name in my sig, it&#039;s okay I don&#039;t keep any money on the account anyways god forbid I somehow got hacked.<br />-euler
