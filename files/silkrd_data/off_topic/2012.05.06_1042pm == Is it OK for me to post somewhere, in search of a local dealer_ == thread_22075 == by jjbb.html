				Not really, from a security stand point you wont find a vendor who would meet you F2F, why not just order it yourself?

				I guess because my needs are very small, and I&#039;d feel more comfortable doing a local transaction, but, then again, I&#039;m new, so maybe I&#039;ll just learn for a while here, and then decide.

				Basically, I dont think its against the rules but you will not find a local dealer here, the only thing you might find is a cop

No order is really to small there is always someone on SR who will acommodate small orders.

				My needs are small also, i was initially put off by the prices but they are not as bad as they look, considering how bad the quality of street gear is you actually get fair value for money here (judging by other peoples opinions). you can buy small sample orders from a lot of sellers too, ive just purchased about 9-odd btc to get used to the SR and I am going to order a couple off pills and a sample of nose candy. you always see people on the topix Valium forum arranging to meet a local dealer but its asking for trouble.

Or goto a few bars and make chat with the local bartenders/regular drinkers there. Once you feel comfortable with them, just ask about &#039;party-favors&#039; that might be around outside of the bar. <br />Just gotta keep meeting people, and trust your gut instinct, i&#039;d say. Or bug your friends to see if they know anyone local, and can trust them.
