				I heard a story pretty recently about this poor kid in Maryland. He was like 16, and was having consensual sex with a girl in the back of a car. In the middle of the act the girl told him to stop, and a few seconds later he did.<br /><br />The girl took him to court, and he was found guilty of rape because it took him a couple of goddamn seconds to pull out. That case set a precedent that there is now a &quot;5 second rule&quot;. If you take longer than 5 seconds to retract your shlong&nbsp; from when the girl says stop, you can kiss your freedom goodbye. How can you prove that it took you less than 5 seconds? You can&#039;t. <br /><br />There is no making this shit up<br /><br /><br />Bitches n whores man, bitches n whores

				I&#039;ll tell you something that really ticked me off earlier....<br /><br />Earlier I was pulling out of a petrol station (gas station to you Americans), there were two slots to pull out, one to go right, one to go left.<br /><br />There was a reallllly old guy trying to cross the road, clearly mentally disabled and in a lot of pain walking (easily over 100), bend double etc, he was also trying to carry some shopping which can&#039;t have been easy. All the cars pulling out were just driving into him and noone was stopping for him so I stopped my car in the middle of the road next to him, holding up all the traffic behind me, got out, and helped him across the road to the other side safely.<br /><br />When I got back to my car the guy from the car behind me had come to my door and was spitting at me, shouting abuse at me and being very rude, as was everyone in all the cars behind... I had literally taken 10 seconds....<br /><br />WTF? What&#039;s so important in peoples lives that they can&#039;t wait 10 seconds for a clearly very old man to cross the road?

				early twenty something year olds that use the word &quot;society&quot; too much. as in, &quot;society makes it hard for people like me to succeed.&quot;<br /><br />Girls who put quotes up on social network forums that seem deep and introspective, but upon further examination reveal nothing, eg. &quot;live, laugh, love...or...Live your dreams, don&#039;t dream your life...or...&quot;Love and let live...blah blah blah...&quot;<br /><br /><br />By the way, seems like a lot of anti women coments in this thread. Don&#039;t know what&#039;s up with that, but I hope you guys are kidding :)
