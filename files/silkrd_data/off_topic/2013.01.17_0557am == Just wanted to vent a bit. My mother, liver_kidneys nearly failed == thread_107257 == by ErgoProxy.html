				I do not know every detail of why this happened, but basically, she has taken a LOT of APAP over the last few months, which I just found out recently. <br /><br />At first, her liver and kidneys were failing. Her MRI basically showed that her brain was VERY bad off. But then, within the following couple hours, she , as surprised as the doctors were, she started to recover from it. <br /><br /><br />I was very much ready to donate one of my kidneys to her, but the hospital did not deem me fit enough. Sadly. :( <br /><br />What really sucks is now she has taken a turn for the worst. The last time I went to visit, she was catatonic. And before that, the day before,&nbsp; I was told she was speaking again. And even moving around quite a bit. Well enough to sit up on her own, in bed. So when I walked into her room, she had her eyes wide open, and she was looking off into nowhere. <br /><br />Man, this really does suck. If I may ask, has anyone reading this ever have someone with kidney and liver damage, having dialysis, actually recover, with full function of their mind? <br /><br /><br />

				Someone else around SR is in a similar situation, unless it was me talking to you under another alias over on the marketplace! <br /><br />Either way, I&#039;m terribly, terribly sorry to hear that your mom&#039;s health has taken a negative turn.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Has your mom also had strokes alongside the kidney/liver damage?&nbsp; If the strokes are what has caused her mental functions to deteriorate, then that might be a separate issue from the kidney/liver failure.&nbsp; Obviously I&#039;m not a doctor, so I don&#039;t know, but I wanted to let you know you&#039;re not alone.&nbsp; Even if you were the one I was talking with over on SR!

				LoL Are you the new mod??? If so, its me! <br /><br />Good to see you! (If its you, or even if its not!)&nbsp; :P Thank you for the kind words, my friend! <br /><br />And yes, she has. Several strokes, actually. Brain stem strokes, several of them. :( I tell ya, I am not much for the whole religion thing, but I have been praying like a S.O.B.

				Do they know why the organs are failing?<br /><br />I think this is the main determination on if she has a chance of recovery.<br /><br />If the problem is isolated to the liver/kidneys there could be a chance of recovery.&nbsp; If it is an external issue like cancer causing the failure I don&#039;t want to sound down but this is one of the first signs of non-recovery.&nbsp; I have seen of several close people to me that have died with this as one of the first serious symptoms.<br /><br />Could it be a diet problem?<br /><br />Any more information would probably help to better respond as far as the likelihood of recovery.<br /><br />No matter what, just make sure you stay by your mom and keep telling her you love her.&nbsp; I lost my mother to cancer about eight years ago and it was one of the hardest things I&#039;ve ever gone through.&nbsp; The one thing I wish I did though was keep telling her more stories about the things that made her so special to me in the end.&nbsp; She eventually had cancer reach her brain and it made it more difficult to talk to her; but I still always wish I was more open with her at the end.&nbsp; Just try to make sure you have no regrets.

				Awwe.. I&#039;m getting all teary eyed, that&#039;s so sad hoobydoobydoo.. I just want to give you a big hug!<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry ErgoProxy that&#039;s so sad.. Either way though you stay beside your mum and try to remember when you were young with her, don&#039;t dwell on her current state. I really hope they figure out what&#039;s causing the issue and resolve it. Mummy love is a very strong love :)<br />You have a community here with many loving individuals, you can talk to us &lt;3

				Thanks, people! <br /><br />She seems to getting better, after things started to head for the worst, thankfully. I am going to take the evening off Wednesday and stay with her in the hospital. Good news is, as of right now, she is at least speaking again. So I will speak with her for the first time in over 2 weeks. :) I hope anyway.

				Good news. She will be leaving surgical intensive care within the next few days. Then it is off to rehab, I guess, to work on whatever she may have forgotten. What a roller coaster ride! <br /><br /><br />I will be spending the last couple of nights with her, at the hospital. =P&nbsp; Such amazing news, especially considering all we have been told. And we have sever relatives who are being testing, to see if they can donate a kidney. So she doesnt have to go through dialysis for the remainder of her life. :) <br /><br /><br />Thanks, guys!

				Wow, thank you so much, Chem! You fucking people are just awesome. So much support, it&#039;s fantastic! Isn&#039;t that what it&#039;s all about, though? ;) <br /><br />And yes.... I will stick to thanking the doctors, and kick ass nurses who have taken care of her. Speaking of nurses... I walked in and this dude was rubbing her back with scented lotions. What service! =P&nbsp; Really is amazing the attention they show patients in SICU. <br /><br />Again, thanks to all! She&#039;s not done yet. And she has got some memory still. When asked where I was today she was told I was up all night working, per the usual... You know what she says? &quot;Figures, noob!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;facepalm.jpg Lol I rolled.
