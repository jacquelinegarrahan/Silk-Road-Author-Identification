				I&#039;m not sure exactly where to post this... but here it goes<br /><br />So i made an order with a vendor and accidentally clicked on the wrong shipping method (which was a more costly shipping method) ..tracked and sig req.<br /><br />I immediately emailed him stating the problem, and the shipping method i would like and that i did not want tracked at all, as well as this if he could refund the extra cost that got taken out of my account, the seller said &#039;you must FE this before the order will be shipped&#039;<br />So i did as requested, now he sends me a tracking number for my package which seems to be a semi local delivery... when mine blatantly was the other side of the world.<br /><br />I have emailed the seller about this but have not heard back.<br /><br />If the seller did send it using the wrong shipping and it does not get to my country, should i be getting a refund... a reship or nothing at all..... the issue was stated in emails to him and he just said FE it.....<br /><br /><br />Thoughts and comment?

				Well my friend, I can&#039;t say for sure because I don&#039;t know what vendor you are dealing with, but is he reputable? If his listing didn&#039;t require that you finalize early, it&#039;s a bit odd that he asked you after the order was placed. Regardless, you gave up your main line of defense when you FE&#039;d and the best thing to do is watch everything closely and try to remain in contact with the vendor. It&#039;s in his hands now.
