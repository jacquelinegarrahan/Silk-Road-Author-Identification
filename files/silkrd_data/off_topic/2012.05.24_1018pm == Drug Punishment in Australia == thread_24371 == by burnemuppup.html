				Its probably alot worse for importing drugs. But here is an example of the punishment in Australia for being caught with Personal stash of Cocaine, MDMA tabletS and steriods: $3000 fine, conviction. no jail time.<br /><br />http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/bikie-cleo-bachelor-josh-downey-fined-for-drug-stash/story-e6frf96o-1226364594160<br /><br />anyone know what the punishment is for importing personal amounts?

				Maybe he couldn&#039;t find the search bar, it&#039;s at the top right corner.. Yes, the white thingy with &#039;search&#039; next to it. <br />If you type something you want to know in there, it might provide you with the answers you&#039;re looking for ;)<br /><br />Also, I notice online, and in daily life, that when you tell people where something is, or how it works, that they forget. But when they find it out by themselves, the knowledge sticks :)

I am as new as the OP but I haven&#039;t even thought of hitting up a new topic. Everything you need to know is usually on the first page of topics. Any question you have are already answered. I know you are probably as excited as me about finding this place and want to become a fast and well liked member of SR which is why you may be opening these topics, but the best way to do it is by talking to people normally and doing a bit of basic research about this place yourself.<br />

				Why, people in Australia call each other dickhead all the time?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />And I know the feeling, Dutch people have the tendency to act like complete morons on the internets as well.. <br />I guess every country has their crooks ;D
