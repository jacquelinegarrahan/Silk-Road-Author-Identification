				Dude I know. My first order got lost and 2 weeks later, when I was sure it wasn&#039;t coming, it arrived. It was 10 hits of lsd. I had never tried it before, and ate a piece of the strip. 30 minutes later I decided it was really weak low grade acid and ate it all. Boy was I in for a surprise, my life has never been the same since that day. I should have researched lsd more but in the end I decided that trip was worth it.

				I think the majority of us go through this torture with most deliveries&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />On the bright side, When it finally IS there, I feel like i just did 3 lines of coke because i&#039;m so excited about the package! Then I have a perma-smile for an hour because of the disbelief of receiving yet another package with no problems!

				So funny, I sit here devastated that my order(s) were absent in the mail and just saw this post... I feel for you man..&nbsp; <br /><br />Phone is blowing up and every time I ignore a call, I ignore money. Just have to keep telling people &quot;I should get it tomorrow.&quot; Another problem is that I also have no buds to smoke... So I am going to have to buy a small bit of my last batch back from a friend (we won&#039;t sell it to me for what I sold to him) for a large markup.<br /><br />When I have enough product and personal smoke for myself its almost fun checking the mail for my extra ordered goodies, like xmas morning and the mailman is santa claus!

				Just let me put my anger in a little sentence:<br />YOU FUCKING MAIL OFFICE MORONS, I&#039;M GETTING ON W/Ds BECAUSE OF YOU LAZY MOTHERFUCKERS!!<br /><br />There are official holidays, tomorrow and on monday here, so they won&#039;t work. I&#039;m waiting on that package since ~12 days, expecting it in like 5 days (reliable vendor, always took only like 5 days expect now!). Now I&#039;m suffering w/ds for 3 or 4 days because my stuff won&#039;t last that long..<br /><br />Well, I guess I&#039;m ordering from another vendor just now, out of panic, some package MUST be there next week. I&#039;m really afraid of withdrawals..

				Today is day 5 or 6, depending on when the order actually was dropped at the post, for a domestic package.... IT MUST BE HERE TODAY!<br /><br />If not, tomorrow is fine too. haha.<br /><br />But really, if it isn&#039;t here today, it means the vendor, at a minimum, dropped the ball and waited more than a day or two to mail the product.

				I believe I am addicted to waiting for orders to arrive.&nbsp; There is some kind of rush I get when walking out to check the mail box. Thinking to my self, is it there?&nbsp; Well... today is another one of those joyous days where there is hope that another package might arrive.&nbsp; The longest hour and half of my life is ahead of me.&nbsp; What can I do to make the time pass, maybe watch a movie, run some errands.&nbsp; Who am I kidding, I just want to sit here in agony and look out the window till it arrives.&nbsp; What is worse, is the possibility of disappointment that I might receive today.&nbsp; Which completely ruins my day, however this time is a little different. I actually still have some goodies from last time.&nbsp; The bitter sweet moment approaches when the mail woman will arrive.&nbsp; I always close my eyes, not to see if she put it in there or not.&nbsp; I like my slow walk of anxiety towards the mail box.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Will update in hour an half.
