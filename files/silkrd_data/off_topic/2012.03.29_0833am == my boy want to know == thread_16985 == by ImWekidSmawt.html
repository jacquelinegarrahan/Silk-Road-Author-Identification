				not every arrest makes it into the news or papers. most of the bust you hear about are for bulk shipments, which make sense. A undercover operation and the man hours are very expensive. usually its bulk shipments, but there are always anomalies. always be prepared for the worse and only buy from trusted members.

				More likely to just get a love letter. Even if the package is intercepted it would be a big pain to prove that you actually ordered it. But like marsvolta said be prepared and only buy from trusted sources. Personally I wouldn&#039;t even consider doing business with anyone with a rating under 98 or under 50+ transactions.

				i dont buy from somebody unless they have more then 300 transactions and above 97% positive rating. special exceptions are when somebody like nomad bloodbath vouches for a new vendor

				But this is not conducive to new sellers getting their start. Be mindful of this, I am giving a new guy a start this week, Why? Because he has been commutative and goes through the proper motions. (Samples, escrow, etc...) I&#039;d say rather than letting bigger vendors get too comfortable on their laurels, be willing to open up to new vendors that follow protocols.<br /><br />Sorry to get off topic.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t believe (knock on wood) that LE is interested in busting down doors for that amount, when there are often known local pushers too go after. Aside from the occasional bulk shipment seizure.
