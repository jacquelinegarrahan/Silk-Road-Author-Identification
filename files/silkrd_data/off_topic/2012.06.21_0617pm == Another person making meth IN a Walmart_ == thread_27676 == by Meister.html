				I posted about the news story of the woman making meth in her purse at a St. Louis Walmart while she was being detained for shop lifting, now some guy is caught in Ohio doing the same thing. Here we are with threads worrying about being busted because our bridge, VPN or encryption isn&#039;t up to snuff while these dipshits are making meth in a crowded store.<br /><br />http://fox8.com/2012/06/19/man-arrested-for-making-meth-inside-mentor-walmart/<br /><br />MENTOR, Ohio –A Perry man was arrested on Sunday evening for allegedly making methamphetamine inside a Walmart store in Mentor.<br /><br />Mentor Police Lt. Ken Zbiegien tells Fox 8 News that James Richardson, 37, was spotted by store security around 5:30 p.m. on June 17th.<br /><br />Security witnessed Richardson placing ingredients in his shopping cart that are common in the production of meth. <br /><br />According to Zbiegien, Richardson then combined the ingredients in a salt shaker he had taken off a store shelve and began shaking the container.<br /><br />Zbiegien says that Richardson was using a common method to make meth known as ‘shake-and-bake’. Police refer to the method as ‘one-pot’ meth cooking.<br /><br />Richardson was arrested as he attempted to walk from the store with the drug. He was charged on counts of illegal manufacturing of methamphetamine and theft.<br /><br />Zbiegien says Richardson has five previous felony drug convictions. He remains housed in the Lake County jail on a $75,000 bond.<br />Richardson is scheduled for a pre-trial hearing on June 25th.

				Out of curiosity what is the shake, and bake method?<br /><br />Many years ago, I use a solvent, and acid in the process.<br />What are they doing now?<br />No way I could hide the process.<br />I only did it once, and I didn&#039;t inhale. 8)

				Materials : 1 box of pseudo-ephedrine pills, 1 Cold-Compress pack, a bottle of lye crystals, 2 AA energizer lithium batteries, Coleman fuel, Iodized salt, sulfuric acid or Muriatic acid, 2 20oz bottles, coffee filters, a clear hose about 6 - 12&quot; long, funnel, 2 Pint Mason jars, and lineman pliers. <br /><br />first off, make sure your working in a clean and safe area. Clean both of the 20oz bottles with some paper towels and a clothes hanger, rinse with Coleman fuel, and repeat. You want the bottles to be clean as possible to make clean dope. <br /><br />After you clean one bottle, use your funnel and one coffee filter and put 8oz of Coleman fuel in the bottle. Then, using your lineman pliers, obtain the lithium metal from the batteries, tear them small balls and put them in your fuel. After you get both your lithium strips in, add 3 tablespoons of crushed Ammonia nitrate from the cold compress pack, and 3 tablespoons of lye crystals. Shake the bottle and get a reaction going. After you get a good reaction add your crushed pseudo-ephedrine and let it cook for 45 minutes to an hour. Burping the bottle when it get tight. refrain from shaking the bottle in the during the last 15 minutes of the cook.<br />&nbsp;<br />Their should be a good amount of copper &quot;b.b.s&quot; floating with your lithium strips. this is a good sign your cook is close to finished. Clean out the mason jar you have ready, and use 3-4 filters to filter off your cook into the mason jar. <br /><br />Now its time to make a smoke bottle, either using sulfuric acid or Muriatic acid. Clean the 20oz bottle like before, and make a hole in the cap big enough for your hose. if your using sulfuric acid, add 1 tablespoon of salt to the bottle and just a couple drops of sulfuric acid. If your using Muriatic acid, put 3-4 balls of aluminum foil in the bottle and a couple drops of Muriatic acid. Put the hose right above your fuel in the mason jar and watch the dope drop. <br /><br />Hit it with the smoke a couple times and stir it up until it doesn&#039;t drop anymore, then filter this into another mason jar, and you got your first pull in the filter. dry it out and test it. then take the fuel you poured off and put it back in the cook bottle. cook it for about 30 minutes and try for a second pull. <br /><br />You should yield about a gram, to a gram and a half of Methamphetamine.

				Thanks, I was wondering how could you do this in a store?<br />I remember the process is very dangerous.<br />Thanks for the instructions, knowledge is power.<br />Not that I would even try it ;)<br />I signed a form promising I wouldn&#039;t convert the sinus med box to meth.<br />Didn&#039;t realize 1 box got you enough for a ride.........

We&#039;re simply advising against people endangering their lives, and the lives of others, by creating meth using the noted method. One of the main priorities of these forums is Drug Safety, we can&#039;t forget that.

				They&#039;re making it in Walmart so they can shoplift the supplies and save that $40 or whatever for food for their kids, they&#039;re trying to be responsible parents.<br /><br />Seriously though wouldn&#039;t it be far easier to shoplift it out of the store and then make it in private? I don&#039;t know if it still works, but when I was a kid we would load up Walmart bags in our pockets, go through and shop like normal, then in one aisle we knew wasn&#039;t seen by a camera we put all our shit in the Walmart bags, tearing off the plastic security strips if it was electronics, then walking out the store like we had purchased it. Out of a hundred or so trips we were only stopped once and asked for our receipt, which we then abandoned the cart and took off.
