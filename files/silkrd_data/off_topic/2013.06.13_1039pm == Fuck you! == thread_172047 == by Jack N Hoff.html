				I&#039;m sure there&#039;s still quite a bit of BTC floating around. And do you think BTC will be the be all and end all? There will surely be other crypto-currency. Just like there will always be other black markets. If BTC falls, another will rise. I think too many people depend on being anonymous for BTC to be the only ever crypto currency that is used.<br /><br />But that could also be because I think you mean &quot;invest in coin&quot; like &quot;invest in stocks&quot; you&#039;re just buying and selling all the time, going with the fluctuations of the market. 25k today gets me around 220 BTC (just going off general exchange rate) or around 204 BTC (after agent fees). The most I&#039;ve seen in recent days BTC go to is around $129 AUD mark. even if it went to that I would only make a few grand. There would have to be some massive shift like the prices to jump back up to $200+ again to make any kind of decent profit from that.....unless &quot;investing in coins&quot; is &quot;investing in drugs&quot; in which case, I&#039;m trying to do something different with this, I have that avenue being sorted too.

				They will be over $500 in the future and if another crypto currency doesn&#039;t take over, they will be over $1,000.&nbsp; Also, mining keeps paying less and less.&nbsp; That shit keeps doubling in difficulty and becoming more decentralized.&nbsp; More and more people keep mining.&nbsp; Everyone is getting ASICs.&nbsp; Miners will eventually be making more off of transaction fees than they do off the measly bitcoins that they are able to mine.

I&#039;m looking at faster and decent return of rates.

If you buy mining rigs, which would be asics, there is quite the waiting list and then it will take you time just to even make back that investment( +pluss electricity). Now imagine you buy coins and the price doubles this month/
