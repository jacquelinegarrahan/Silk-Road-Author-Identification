				American and western women have been demanding equality. Well, why don&#039;t they demand that MEN should get custody of the children 50 percent of the time? As it stands, women get custody of the children after divorce 90 percent of the time.<br /><br />Why don&#039;t women DEMAND that 50 percent of alimony and child support payers should be WOMEN? As it stands, 99 percent of alimony and child support is men paying it to women. Why shouldn&#039;t 50 percent of WOMEN pay alimony/CS to men, especially now that women on average are making more money than their husbands? Do you women really not see the massive hypocrisy here?<br /><br />Or what about the draft, selective service? Why aren&#039;t women demanding that WOMEN should also be forced to register for the military draft?<br /><br />Frankly, until women become 50 percent, EQUAL, of the following six categories, all their claims for equality is nothing but bullshit:<br /><br />War dead - 98% men<br />Workplace dead - 93% men<br />Incarcerated - 90% men<br />Homeless - 90% men<br />Alimony payers - 99% men<br />Child support payers - 99% men<br /><br />Is anyone else here sick and tired of the constant bullshit, lies, and hypocrisy of American and western women?<br /><br />As for myself, I don&#039;t even bother with them anymore. I only date Asian women now. And I can tell you, Asian women are a 100 times better than American/western women. Asian women are still feminine, submissive, humble, affectionate, chaste, loyal, etc.<br /><br />American and western women can&#039;t compete with Asian women, which is why they are trying to ban or limit western men from marrying them. Look at Sweden. The most feminist country on earth. It also has the highest number of Thai wives than any other country. One Swedish feminist politician was saying that Sweden needs to make a law limiting the number of women from Thailand that Swedish men can marry.<br /><br />LOL! You white women are so big strong and independent, and you feel threatened by a bunch of Asian women? No, you women are NOT &quot;big strong and independent and liberated&quot;. You are a bunch of cowardly little girls with very low self esteem.

				I call bull the fact is that women may make less on average then men but they also have more persuasion power over men in everyday society. This bull that women aren&#039;t equal to men ain&#039;t fair cause it just ain&#039;t true.<br /><br />They have many benefits that more then makes up for the perceived lacks when compared to men. Want example? How many times do you see men women getting into a club for free when the guys have to pay just because of their gender. Come on now tell the truth but tell the whole truth!<br /><br />Just so I&#039;m being clear here I&#039;m not trying to bash women not at all that&#039;s not what this is about I love women. It just ticks me off when they pull the inequality card out of their purse.

				Well with the current economic situation it&#039;s not surprising that women are catching up with men when it comes to pay.&nbsp; My town may be unique but where I&#039;m currently living a decently-looking girl can go work for a bar / restaurant and make $40 / hour because of tips.&nbsp; The guys I know who don&#039;t have degrees (and some even with degrees) end up selling drugs.&nbsp; Girls also get free drinks when they go out, can jump ahead in line, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s easier to be one gender or the other, just pointing some more stuff out.&nbsp; As a male I personally wouldn&#039;t switch to being a female if I could.&nbsp; Equal pay means nothing if you are constantly receiving unwanted advances every time you go out in public.

				It seems to me that in the west, men are raised to &quot;support women&quot; and we are taught to put women above us in relationships (always pay for their shit).&nbsp; To add to the fact that alot of men work just to have good relationships because they are satisfying their partner financially, many men are just perverts and will give free stuff to women they don&#039;t even know anyway or spend their paycheck at a strip club on women.&nbsp; I know that some women work hard, but a ridiculous amount of them just get through their younger years on looks and it makes for some pretty unintelligent, spoiled, hard to respect women.&nbsp; Thats why I like to date europeans :)

				It is absolutely true that women are different in Asia.&nbsp; There is a flip side to this as well though, because you have to be the kind of man who is willing to &quot;step up&quot; and be the man in the relationship.&nbsp; A lot of western men are just pussies and Asian women hate that.

				Thats a generalization about men and i believe the question was just about US women. At the least I would argue that neither genders have it any easier than the other
