				Watching Sky News for a change this morning - apparently 7 people died last year of carbon monoxide poisoning because they brought a BBQ into their tent.<br /><br />Also in recent years, 5 people in the UK died from MDMA related incidents. MDMA is a class A controlled substance and is illegal to possess without a license from the home office.<br /><br />Ergo tents and BBQ&#039;s should be placed under strict control also. Too many people have died from this evil carbon monoxide terror already and we must unite to stop it before it gets to the level of smoking or alcohol related deaths and&nbsp; definitely before the government realises that it is a useful form of population control, tax revenue and political gambit. <br /><br />That is all.

				Around 100 people are killed each year from spinal injury&#039;s caused by horse riding. <br />5 people were killed by mdma related deaths (which are easily avoided if the victims were educated correctly). Says it all really.

				If you bring a BBQ into your tent and die from Carbon Monoxide poisoning that&#039;s called natural selection.
