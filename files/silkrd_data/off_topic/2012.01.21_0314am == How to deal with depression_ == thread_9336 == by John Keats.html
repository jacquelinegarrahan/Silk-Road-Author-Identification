				Hey SR.<br /><br />I&#039;m struggling with some really serious depression right now. A lot of things have converged onto me all at one time and the stress/pressure/dissatisfaction have made me contemplate just giving up on all my obligations and even committing suicide.<br /><br />Anyone have some good advice on how to deal with this? Perhaps a drug that I won&#039;t become dependant on? Are drugs even an effective remedy? I don&#039;t want to simply &quot;drown out&quot; my problems with booze or acid or such.<br /><br /><br />Your affectionate friend,<br />John Keats

				How do you drown out your problems with acid? Most people work through their problems on LSD! You mean they actually come back after you do acid? Then I would say you probably have an actual case of clinical depression, and most people diagnosed surely don&#039;t.

				Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a powerful &#039;mind tool&#039; if you take it seriously, and are guided by a psychiatrist.&nbsp; Its basically a way of understanding how your mind processes thoughts and behaviors induced by those thoughts.&nbsp; In an almost &#039;meditative&#039; like sense there are way&#039;s to deflect the cognition modal your brain is undergoing and sort of &#039;short-circuit&#039; the thought cycle (typically depression is the result of a cycle of thoughts that keep progressing worse and worse).&nbsp; It has actually given me some measure of usefulness considering it only requires your mind.<br /><br />The reuptake inhibitors aren&#039;t necessarily addictive.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite easy to get off them if you taper the dose down over a week or two.&nbsp; The problems people typically assign to withdrawal are actually just the effects of the depression resuming.&nbsp; Usually a doc will switch you, where you taper one dose down of the one you&#039;re getting off of and taper up the new one.&nbsp; You become dependent on them, but only in the sense that you&#039;re taking a a drug to maintain whatever neurological equilibrium the drug has established in your brain to mitigate the symptoms of depression.&nbsp; People take thyroid drugs their whole life to maintain an equilibrium in hormones, I see no reason for anyone to think that anti-depressant&#039;s should be treated any differently.&nbsp; Depression is a real, physical disease of the brain.<br /><br />Personally I wouldn&#039;t drown myself in dissociative/psychedelics/etc.&nbsp; If you have REAL clinical depression then the problem will still be there when you sober up.&nbsp; Anti-depressants are designed to level out an imbalance caused by the disease and hit it at it&#039;s source.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying they work for everyone but there is utility in researching anti-depressants.

				Just a friendly little warning about SSRI&#039;s; They *can* help with depression, but their side effects, mainly drowsiness, weight gain, and loss of libido (sex drive) can make your situation even worse.

				You&#039;re right couchman, they can induce unwanted and sometimes unacceptable side effects (I can&#039;t take ANY SSRI class drugs cuz I can&#039;t get/maintain an erection).<br />Some people also never experience any side effects, so that&#039;s why I just suggest he explore it.&nbsp; Anything you can do to treat depression is a good thing.<br /><br />Yoga is an excellent option as well a_blackbird, no reason to laugh at all.&nbsp; It releases endorphins throughout your body, and besides any exercise is very helpful with depression.&nbsp; I don&#039;t do yoga but understand enough that it can put you into a mild meditative state as you said, which is very helpful with dealing.<br /><br />Meditation itself is also a great form of &#039;escape&#039; and &#039;collection&#039; (of thought&#039;s, emotions, etc.) and is difficult to achieve but there are many easily accessible texts on techniques that teach you how to reach deeper meditation states which after a while becomes easy to get to, I would look into it.<br /><br />

				sometimes you have to weigh out the possibility that your depression may never go away or be cured vs. the risk that you may become dependent on a drug. For me i&#039;m dependent on opiates, and&nbsp; i&#039;ve decided i&#039;d rather be addicted to something and be happy than live with dehibilitating depression.&nbsp; <br /><br />most drugs will worsen your depression. At least thats how it is for me. I don&#039;t really like smoking weed, because it seems that it both makes me aware of how depressed i really am, and makes me even more depressed the following day.&nbsp; alcohol is also a depressant and while it can numb you of your depression, it can also amplify it.&nbsp; Many people say just getting outside and getting excersise is something that helps.<br /><br />don&#039;t kill yourself. that&#039;s what &#039;the powers that be&#039; want you to do.

				This is the worst place on Earth to ask about depression. Go to a psychiatrist if you actually want to get better. Anything else is a temporary solution INCLUDING weed. Most people wont tell you that, but there, I did. Unless your depressed because of a girlfriend or something stupid, then smoke some weed. But REAL clinical depression, go to the doctor. Don&#039;t listen to any of these fuckers or you&#039;ll end up killing yourself.

				take the lemons life is giving you and make some lemonade.&nbsp; in other words take those thoughts that depression is giving you and turn it into art. pick up a paintbrush or write some poetry or try to learn music.

Have you ever noticed that your mind can only think of one thing at a time? Try playing a word game, really concentrate on it - and also try reciting words to an Aerosmith song at the same time. It&#039;s pretty hard. <br /><br />find something you can call a real hobby. Find something you are passionate about. I find it counter productive to be passionate about depression forums since I see that a lot of people will sit in front of the computer and think think think about depression. Some people make depression their hobby. <br /><br />This might be extreme but I&#039;ve never thought about being depressed while sexting. . . <br /><br />the only time that depression will seep into your mind are the times your mind is not filled with something else. Make yourself busy - that is the only long term cure. <br />
