				I&#039;ve got some MXE from SR and I&#039;m trying to get to the &quot;K Hole&quot; for the first time. I&#039;m up to 70 mg and I&#039;m not still not there. I&#039;m all fucked up and everything, but I have yet to experience that out of body effect. I don&#039;t want to OD but am I taking enough? Does body size matter? Thanks.

				110mg will fuck you up a lot but it probably won&#039;t send you into an M-hole. Try bumping your dose up to 140mg. Before doing so, set aside a small amount (30-60mg) of MXE to redose if you need. Put the rest of your stash somewhere you can&#039;t get to it because trying to redose out of a big bag while really messed up on MXE can result in taking WAY too much.<br /><br />What is your ROA? Oral, insufflated, plugged, IV, IM?<br /><br />It is also possible that your MXE isn&#039;t as pure as sellers are claiming. It is unlikely any MXE is 99.7% pure or even close to it.<br /><br />Another thing you should try is to lay down with your eyes closed (an eye mask is best here) in a dark room like on your bed, and let your thoughts and feelings carry you away. At a 110mg dose you should start getting the physical feeling that you are sinking deeper and deeper into the earth. It is really incredible. Doing this may also help get closer to a hole. Sensory deprivation gets rid of all the senses which keep you in touch with reality. Your mind will start to experience reality in a different way. Try this out at a 100mg dose and, if you aren&#039;t where you want to be, redose another 30-60mg and lay back down.<br /><br />If you still haven&#039;t reached a mild M-hole at 150mg then you probably have some week stuff. This isn&#039;t a big deal as it is fairly cheap and you can just take extra (like 180-200mg) to make up for the lack of potency. Don&#039;t start too high and wait at least 45 minutes to an hour before redosing as it can take a while to fully hit you. <br /><br />I recently ordered some ketamine from 3Jane and it is fucking bomb, and only ~$50 per gram. You may want to give that a try when she re-lists it. The body high at low doses is very numbing, much like an opiate.<br /><br />Good luck and be careful! It is best to have a sober (or at least somewhat sober) sitter to make sure you don&#039;t hurt yourself - especially since you are new to this.

				K-hole is with ketamine<br />M-hole is with methoxetamine<br /><br />You can&#039;t be calling the MXE hole a K-hole, it is very different. Less of a hole and more of a backwards tunnel with a few unilateral shifts.
