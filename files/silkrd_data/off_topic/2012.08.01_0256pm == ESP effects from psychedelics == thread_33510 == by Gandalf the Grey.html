				I would like to find out from you experienced trippers out there if anyone really has experienced what can be called paranormal effects from using psychedelics, either during the trip itself or as an after trip enhancement of one&#039;s cognitive abilities.<br /><br />Any effect at all, viz. telepathy, precognition, psychometry, ESP (reading words or playing cards without looking at them), astral projection, telepathy with animals, etc.<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				I experience an awful lot of deja vu after I&#039;ve been tripping.<br /><br />But I&#039;m pretty sure this is a trick the mind plays, and is not an extrasensory effect.

				Thanks for your answer, PsilocybinTendencies. I agree, deja vu is one of the most common mental effects, experienced anywhere anytime, and cannot be called psychic at all.<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				Yes, I think that tripping CAN make you tuned into someones thoughts!<br /><br />Many times tripping with close friends, we have all seen the same hallucinations. We have said the same words at the same time.<br /><br />Also if you have a pet, tripping with the pet is very intense sometimes. Like you tune into how your pet feels.<br /><br />My dog knew when I was tripping and was very affectionate and seemed to sense my own euphoria and positiveness.<br /><br />The human mind is a mystery. Science is fumbling in the dark as to how minds work.<br /><br />Maybe we are more connected than we realise. <br /><br />Like we are all as one.<br /><br />The best trips I felt that.<br /><br />Connected to trees, flowers, everything living and felt energy off inanimate objects.<br /><br />Be careful though. NEVER chase that feeling. NEVER use hallucinogenics to aid you in any psychic matters.<br /><br />Tripping is a special experience that all cultures have historically gone through. For me the mushrooms in England grow once a year to give us that gift.<br /><br />Less is more with hallucinogenics.<br /><br />Also, people can have unexplained experiences such as ESP sober.<br /><br />I believe we all have a great ability to perceive how others feel.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Great thread by the way.<br /><br />Hope more join in.

				very interesting topic, id really like to hear more opinions/ input on this subject. i personally do think using psychedelics bestows *something* special upon us. hard to put my finger on what really but something seems more dialed in in my brain. maybe with all the stimulation our brains get while trippin we open up areas of the brain that previously we havent used that do special things. well probably never have any respectable test on the subject but who knows maybe *they* wouldnt want the masses knowing what were capable of? if we could communicate telepathically (very possible probably imo thoughts could be projected&nbsp; and recieved like vibrations picked up by a lazer mic. that spys use to listen into conversations or sumthing..... i know im crazy) we wouldnt be buying i-phones n a lot of other consumery shit.

I always think that it would be so much better to expand our minds, our consciousnesses, in order to freely communicate with one another, IF we wish to be in touch, rather than spend all that time, not to mention toxic material resources, in dumb gadgets. <br /><br />Imagine if we could be part of a planet-wide matrix of interconnected thoughts, exchanging all kinds of information AND emotions, but being completely free to drop out of it at any given time, or to choose not to take part at all, or for a long time. Similar to but even better than the matrix that the planet Pandora has in Avatar. We could perhaps eventually expand it to include all higher life forms and finally understand, and empathize with, all life on this world.<br /><br />Gandalf the Grey

				My first time taking MDMA I had telepathic moments, that were valid through a deep sense of intuition about it.&nbsp; I was totally dumbstruck.&nbsp; I wondered how something this fucking incredible could have been kept off of the radar of possibility.&nbsp; In the past I felt that it was at least possible for someone to THINK that they were telepathic, but not that they could ACTUALLY communicate telepathically.<br /><br />Someone told me to take off my glasses cause they could see I was starting to freak out a little.<br />When I took off my prescription glasses, my vision DID NOT CHANGE.&nbsp; This is where I just lost it.<br /><br />It all became too much and I noobily cried out &quot;I DON&#039;T NEED MY GLASSES??? WHAT ELSE HAVE THEY BEEN LYING TO US ABOUT!!!&quot; &lt;--Big mistake.<br /><br />FWOOOOSSSHHHHH I felt this influx of information about conspiracy theories and 9/11 and I started crying.&nbsp; I cried out for help.&nbsp; The help that was available was a group of minds (my sister, her hubby, and three friends).&nbsp; &quot;They told me it&#039;s all right, you just went a little crazy.&nbsp; You took MDMA&quot;<br /><br />So that&#039;s what I thought, for a long time, that &quot;I just went a little crazy.&quot;&nbsp; Then this summer I tripped on 2-CE and started reading BE HERE NOW, by Ram Dass.&nbsp; By page 16, I was FLOORED. I had a total awakening experience.<br /><br />If you are interested, read this ONE PAGE (pp 16) from Be Here Now.&nbsp; It validated everything I had experienced.<br />http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/5r1heympfk53xt6/images/34-ca672d7494.jpg<br /><br /><br />TL;DR Had telepathic experience first (and only) time tripping on MDMA.&nbsp; Thought I was crazy.&nbsp; Later found out that it was true.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tripped (on anything) since that realization.

				I once had the privilege of tripping with hundreds of people simultaneously, perhaps even a thousand plus.<br /><br />One of the most amazing times of my life. It felt like everybody was sharing their positive vibes, which only got stronger with each soul that got added. I called it &quot;the amazing bubble of happy,&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />I think tripping makes emotional transference more easy. You are more susceptible to your mood being altered. Again, not an extrasensory effect, but pretty fucking cool.

				I experience very strange stuff while tripping. I&#039;ve had contact with dead relatives, natives that have walked this land, aliens, etc. It usually only happens on LSD and mushrooms. I also see the building blocks of the universe (sacred geometries) and I can make anything out of that.

				I have never experienced first hand Extra Sensory Perception or Psychokinesis, but I believe that they do exist we just have to unlock the power in our minds and stop drinking water with fluoride in it and quit brushing our teeth with the stuff because it is calcifying our Pineal Glands in our brains. There is more out there about that conspiracy theory if you truly wish to delve deeper into it. If you want a faster alternative you could always just trip out on some LSD or Shrooms and throw on some good headphones and hypnotize yourself into believing you have these PSY powers with this YouTube video. It&#039;s long, but I think it is really cool, and just the deep state of relaxation that it puts you in is worth an hour and some change to me. I had some crazy Closed Eye Visuals to this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qJal15IMaA <br />Let me know how it works out for you because this is a thread I truly want to follow. And as for the tripping with your dogs thing I trip with my dog all the time and her and I both love it. She loves to smoke weed and one time she got into the Ayahausca Brew. Lol. I think I might have the only dog that can see color.

				My friend and I both took DMT and Salvia in the same bowl and we were both on Ketamine. After the trip, we both told each other that we were able to read each others thoughts. I knew about the girl he had a crush on (lives in a different state, don&#039;t know her, nobody else did either until this point) and he knew a lot of personal things about my mom (extremely specific things about how she used to abuse me that I never told anyone).<br /><br />It was weird as shit. We have no idea what happened. We&#039;ve been best friends for years but we never shared either of those things with each other. That was almost a year ago. One of the strangest things to ever happen to either of us.

				Yes. I&#039;ve experienced telepathy, precognition, and retrocognition.&nbsp; I have also had time-loop experiences, where the same moment is re-lived multiple times, a phenomenon which I don&#039;t think can be explained with our current scientific knowledge.<br /><br />With LSD, there is often this vast demiurgic intelligence that tries to communicate with me.&nbsp; Strof writes about this; apparently it is a relatively common experience among LSD users.&nbsp; Were I a christian, I&#039;d probably interpret the experience as demonic possession, but I usually find it to be very pleasant. Sometimes it seems to take possession of my body, sometimes I can hear its voice, and&nbsp; it tells me things that I wouldn&#039;t have had the knowledge or mental capacity to come up with myself. Things that I afterwards find to be true.

				ESP is a more or less scientifically proven phenomenon, so it&#039;s not implausible that the heightened awareness of psychedelic inebriation may induce ESP.
