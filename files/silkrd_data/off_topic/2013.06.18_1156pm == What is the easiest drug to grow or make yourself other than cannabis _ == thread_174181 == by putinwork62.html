				Mushrooms are your best bet.&nbsp; Way easier than weed (I&#039;ve grown both) and can be close to as profitable if you can move large amounts.&nbsp; Start with PF tek and move on to casings.&nbsp; Make your own pf jars, dont buy them from a vendor or your profit margin will go way down.&nbsp; At most you will need a couple hundred bucks for tubs, spores, jars and other supplies.&nbsp; If you are going to do it long term or for profit then drop a couple hundred on a good pressure cooker, it will save you a lot of wasted materials by cutting down on contaminated jars.&nbsp; Use sporeworks and spores101 for your spores.&nbsp; Penis envy is a good &quot;cash crop&quot; strain, big fruits and people have a good time on them.&nbsp; For info on how to grow use shroomery.org and shroomtalk.&nbsp; A month of incubating your jars and you will have fruits a week after birthing your cakes into the fruiting chamber.&nbsp; Use the dunk and roll technique to get multiple flushes from every cake.&nbsp; Good luck, it is great fun.&nbsp; It&#039;s magical to see the little pins come off the cake during fruiting for the first time knowing those little things will turn into big, healthy mushrooms.&nbsp; Fresh air is a must so you will probably want to grow where you live or where you can hang out every day for a while.

				Poppies (and from these Laudanum or Opium tea or similar), DMT and Shrooms are extremely easy to grow/extract by yourself.<br />Also nightshades are extremely easy to grow but you must be wary about them. The best way is to use them as an ointment (the famous witches salve) that is composed by belladonna/henbane/datura + guess what? the aforementioned poppies (it is scopolamine + morphine etc. that cause the effect; in an ointment tropanes are much less toxic because atropine and the other very toxic components in there don&#039;t pass the fat barrier, plus morphine removes the anxiety effect and increase the dream/visionary aspect).<br /><br />EDIT: Yes, also San Pedro is very easy to grow, but I personally don&#039;t find it to my taste. I prefer much more an Ayahusca, DMT, or either a Shrooms trip than a Sand Pedro one; but naturally this is a thing having to do with what you have to do and personal tastes.

Poppies grows almost everywhere. They are considered a weed for how easy they are to grow. They just need sun and not too cold climates, that&#039;s it.<br />Only some kind of oriental poppies can be a litte difficult to raise (the perennial sorts), the rest are extremely easy and they self propagate (and if you have good alkaline soil they do so at an amount it&#039;s almost difficult to keep up; you will really have to take an eye elsewhere they will expand too much - considering naturally you are in an open field).

Naturally it can just be coincidence or the report being done by an user with a faulty extraction or similar things, but it is a somewhat strange thing nonetheless. You can see the same in the book Psychedelics Shamanism by DeKorne in the section where he talks about DMT extraction from Phalaris; read the trip reports in there, they seem much more akin to a 5-Meo trip than a pure N-N one.

Poppies grows almost everywhere. They are considered a weed for how easy they are to grow. They just need sun and not too cold climates, that&#039;s it.<br />Only some kind of oriental poppies can be a litte difficult to raise (the perennial sorts), the rest are extremely easy and they self propagate (and if you have good alkaline soil they do so at an amount it&#039;s almost difficult to keep up; you will really have to take an eye elsewhere they will expand too much - considering naturally you are in an open field).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you, quite informative.

				+1 to black iris, really good point about phalaris extractions.<br /><br />Not to mention phalaris contains gramine which is toxic in large doses.<br /><br />That being said a crude extract is very simple although not near as clean as other DMT extractions.

				&gt;Shrooms. Definately, &#039;shrooms.<br />If you order the spore syringe right now and go buy some 1/2 pint wide-mouth jars, organic brown rice and vermiculite, you could be eatin&#039; fresh &#039;shrooms in 6-8 weeks. Rinse and repeat.

				Mescaline is a few steps easier then DMT&nbsp; 8).&nbsp; Also, poppies grow like weeds, and their tea is divine.
