				Title says it all, what is your view on guns? Do you think civilians should own firearms? Should the government come and take them all? <br /><br />Personally, I love guns. I own a shitload of them. And yes I own an &#039;assault rifle&#039; a few of them actually. I think every home should have at least one gun. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Since ten years old or alike I played with pellet and airsoft guns. Never used a real gun anyway. Some day... but here in Europe is pretty much an hassle. Either you go hunting, or you go to shooting competitions. Take a license etc etc Some day, maybe some 3D printed gun.&nbsp; ;D ;D <br /><br />I think civilians should be able to own firearms, and I don&#039;t find any reason to forbid them in your own home or private property. Here in some places of Europe if you are being robbed, you aren&#039;t allowed to use a firearm. Fuck that. Really ? <br />Giving the LE the monopoly over your own defense is completely sick. I really don&#039;t understand it. In which shitty political and social paradigm are you living if you aren&#039;t allowed to defend yourself ? <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I believe that guns are not necessary if you have other means of security such as a well protected house and effective police (lol) and the only guns available should be small accurate ones that shoot bullets that will simply go in and out, nothing that is for the purpose of killing, more so to stop someone. As you can tell I know next to nothing about guns but that is my opinion.

				I have shot plenty of guns. However I do think that gun ownership should be limited. I believe that guns purposed for hunting should be entirely legal. I would prefer just bolt action rifles and shotguns be legal but would be content with just rifles and shotguns being legal. I see no point in owning a handgun other than to kill people. Self defense should consist of ways to make sure people dont get into your home such as locking your doors and windows and putting up a fence to deter them ect. If you pay attention to how your house looks from a criminal&#039;s perspective you should have no problems as someone on your street will be dumber than you and their asses will get robbed instead.

				I own a gun and I like going to the shooting range but I support gun control. I don&#039;t usually admit to people that I own a gun because I don&#039;t like being grouped together with the absolutely insane NRA people we have in America. I really don&#039;t get how owning a killing device is a fucking lifestyle for these people. And I also don&#039;t get why people need to stockpile AR-15s for &quot;home defense&quot;.

				<br /><br />I absolutely love them as long as I&#039;m the guy with the gun! LOL <br /><br />Seriously, I carry a semi-automatic pistol with me everywhere I go, and I&#039;ve never had any problems stemming from it. I&#039;ve never had to use it, but as the saying goes, I&#039;d rather have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. I don&#039;t leave the house without mine.

A gun is an object it has no feelings no emotions and its actions are based on the operator of it. I could kill you with a lot of different things. Not just a firearm. <br /><br />Why people need to stockpile ar-15s.... because they fucking can. <br /><br />Not all my firearms are for home defense. I have some that are specifically for protecting myself and property.<br /><br />My &#039;hunting&#039; rifle is a lot more powerful than my ar-15s and can reach out and kill at over a mile (if I had the skill and optics to do so lol)<br /><br />Also if you are in support of gun control... how are they going to take my guns? Send guys with guns to take them. Anyone else see the issue with this? Firearms should be for the elite few of this tyrannic government. The whole point of the second amendment was to give us the right to own firearms so we could overthrow the government if it was necessary. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				I think guns are great... I own an AK in the states but i&#039;m certainly no terrorist. It was passed down through my family because my grandfather was really into conspiracy and all that.&nbsp; He expected the chinese to invade someday and wanted protection from either them, government, terrorists, or crazy people.&nbsp; Being able to have guns also takes business from smugglers and cartels.&nbsp; If we don&#039;t have guns then we are basically sitting ducks who will have to bow to anything/one who threatens our lives just to live, and that is fucked up.
