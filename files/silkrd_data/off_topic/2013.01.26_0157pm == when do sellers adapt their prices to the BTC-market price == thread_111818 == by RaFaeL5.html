				Hi, <br /><br />the price for BTC&#039;s has been going up, up, up but I can&#039;t really see any change in the prices on SR...<br />so I was just wondering: when do sellers actually adapt their prices to the BTC-value? <br /><br />Seller&#039;s can have the BTC&#039;s they get from a deal &quot;hedged&quot;, but buyers can&#039;t - I guess that&#039;s because the sellers are &quot;supposed&quot; to adapt their prices on a regular base to the value of BTC on the market... but it might be a great idea to have the BTC&#039;s that a certain buyer puts on his SR account &quot;hedged&quot; untill the moment he decides to spend it... that way you wouldn&#039;t see your money go &quot;up in smoke&quot; before even having the product to smoke&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />any insight on this?

				When they create a listing they fix the price to USD. It&#039;s not mandatory but there are serious reasons to do it, and still haven&#039;t noticed anyone who doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />Also the hedging option is not only for the sellers, in case you get a refund it will be in USD and not the exact amount of bitcoins you spent.<br /><br />Hedging you SR wallet is not possible, who would pay your loss when btc price falls? SR? Of course not. It&#039;s the nature of the coin, if you don&#039;t like the risks buy as much coins as you want to spend here, and order asap.

				Thx 4 your reply acider,<br />and +1,<br /><br />just out of curiosity... you wrote that when creating a listing dealers had to give a price in USD. <br />Can they only do this in USD, or could non-US dealers also do this in other currencies (so that they could work with their own currency in order to not be influenced by the fluctuations in the USD)?

				I am almost sure the only option available for fiat currency is USD.
