				Does anyone here make money reselling cocaine off of SR? How the hell would you even do that? Shit is so dayumm expensive on the road. I&#039;ve never even tried caine, but interest in it in my area has been around for a bit now.<br /><br />Could you cut it with speed and get away with it on the streets? What would be a good ratio?

				I&#039;m starting to do something similar with molly.&nbsp; Be careful about transporting drugs around because that&#039;s one of the biggest risks.&nbsp; That and stupid clients.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know enough to answer your other questions about cocaine though.

				The only way I see it working out is by cutting it big time.&nbsp; Which I don&#039;t support.&nbsp; You&#039;re better off reselling mdma or benzos.<br /><br />Seriously there are always people in my area who likes some valiums and xanax constantly.&nbsp; It is such easy money.&nbsp; When I used to get valiums for 150 dollars per 300.

Wanted to try pushing some caine though, just doesn&#039;t seem practical with the prices on SR at the moment.

				I actually had a similar idea a while back, just flipped around. In my area you pay ~6-700 a zip, why not pick up a qp (or whatever you can afford), triple wash all the bullshit out, then resell on silk road for $100 a gram?&nbsp; At those prices, you now have made yourself a domestic vendor who can undercut the competition with a comparable product. Even if the shit you got was 20% pure to begin with, you would break even; anything above that is profit. Of course, there are additional expenses I haven&#039;t accounted for, which probably make a whole world of difference, but it doesn&#039;t seem like a bad deal to me :P
