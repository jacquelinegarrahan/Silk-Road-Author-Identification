				good luck :) unfortunately i dont have one for myself, the first time i started using them i was already in college, their SOOOOO helpful, no matter what mood i was in id pop one and be doing homework/studying all night, and for presentations, their perfect, because you can remember every little detail about what your presenting on, and your talkative, PERFECT<br /><br />I havent tried it as a party drug yet, but im sure at some point i will...<br /><br />but again good luck on your appointment

				In the US, as far as I know a psychologist can not write a script.&nbsp; Although a psychiatrist can, since they are a MD.

When i got my script there was a written test/self diagnosis. I just filled it out to meet the symptoms of someone with ADD. Do some research and just put on a good show.

				Do some searches for ADHD symptoms and evaluations online.&nbsp; &nbsp;They will probably give you a standard written eval, and the &quot;correct&quot; answers are pretty obvious.&nbsp; &nbsp; You don&#039;t have to answer them all correctly so don&#039;t sweat it to much. <br /><br />Its ok to be nervous - that is pretty normal for someone getting a psych eval - especially for ADHD.<br /><br />Maybe suggest that your friend is on XYZ and it helps him.&nbsp; You may not get the med of your choice - but you can always go back for more.<br /><br />You&#039;re smart enough to get B&#039;s and figure out SR - I am pretty sure you are smart enough to figure out the eval.

				I think its a psychiatrist then, I don&#039;t know my mom made the appt lol.<br />but yeah i&#039;m pretty confident just playing it by ear i&#039;ve done the research, i just figured it couldn&#039;t hurt to look outside the clear web for tips.<br />thanks for the advice.

				It&#039;s important to be subtle in my opinion. The place you have to worry about being busted for lying is in the DSM IV (if they have you take it. its a ~500 T/F question personality test that can diagnose anything form depression to schizophrenia to anxiety to ADHD. If you for example answer in a way that makes it seem like you have another condition such as social anxiety, the doc will be reluctant to give you the amphetamine script until that issue is resolved. <br />They will look for signs in your childhood. It could help to fabricate some symptoms. according to their diagnosis criteria, ADD is something that youre born with, not something that develops post childhood.<br /><br />Happy travels!<br />whirl
