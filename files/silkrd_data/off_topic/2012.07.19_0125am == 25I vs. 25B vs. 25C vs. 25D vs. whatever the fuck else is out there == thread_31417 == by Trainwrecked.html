				Alright, here&#039;s the deal.&nbsp; Looking to grab some of these eventually.&nbsp; Looking for the one with these best qualities.&nbsp; Visuals, sound distortion, and mind fuck quality.&nbsp; Can anyone explain all of them?&nbsp; And what the fuck is 25G? lmao

				Okay, so I haven&#039;t had too many hallucinogens in my lifetime - though I think ~10-15 trips would count as moderate...<br /><br />I think starting with LSD-25 as the baseline is important - in my experience, LSD-25 is a very linear trip, with little, but never no, visuals, in which your thought continues onward ad infinitum. There&#039;s a vague euphoria which isn&#039;t super great (this is why we candyflip, guys!), but if you&#039;re not having a bad trip, it usually provides you with a great time.<br /><br />25I, in my opinion at least, is much less strong, though you can never be sure how much you&#039;re getting. The three times I&#039;ve had it, I&#039;ve had it with other drugs (weed, liquor, even GHB one time XD), and it&#039;s always been overridden by the other stuff. I felt high when I smoked. I felt drunk when I drank. I felt date-raped when I used- no I didn&#039;t actually get date-raped, but the euphoria easily overrode the 25I. I&#039;m sure the 25I contributed to all of those being a great experience, though! I&#039;m not sure you&#039;d ever choose it over real acid though, even if it were cheaper.<br /><br />25B, I&#039;ve had once, but once again, it was overridden, by liquor. One of my friends swears by it - she says that it&#039;s like a perfect acid, but I&#039;ll believe it when I see it. She likes it with weed, but she&#039;s also a hardcore smoker, while I don&#039;t really like cannabis much.<br /><br />What I&#039;m here to tell you about today, however is 2CD-5ETO. Don&#039;t have it. I had seizures, which followed a terrible, terrible trip, from 3 hits (keep in mind that 3 hits is usually my threshold dose for other hallucinogens). I ended up in the ICU with a tube in my dick, down my throat, and up my nose, and my arm had more needle holes than an H addict&#039;s from the blood draws, 24 hours later. Apparently, they had to take a spinal tap too. From all my research (there is precious little of it done on this thing), it appears that it probably lowered my seizure threshold to something ridiculous and then the panic drove me over, but while Lucy&#039;s been a mean bitch to me once or twice, she&#039;s never given me real problems.

				25b sounds like the closest to what you&#039;re looking for. It is the most visual, very technicolor and vibrant. It&#039;s the second most trippy nbome among the 4 ... on 2mg, hubby said he started to question whether people really died or if they just pretended to age and move on (Highlander scenarios seemed more plausible, hehe). As for sound distortion ... kind of the opposite in that everything is crystal clear and you seem to have the ability to zone into certain sounds that you would otherwise not hear or ignore (footsteps, the fridge kicking in gear, or someone talking in the distance). Emotions are also more sensetive, we were watching the Dark Crystal and those muppets were scaring the crap out of us, lol. <br /><br />25c is the most trippy but visuals are only apparent during the first few hours. When the euphoria starts to kick in, the visuals die down (same for 25d, they are the real-good, feel-good nbomes). But if you want reality to dissolve away, this one has the most potential to do it. <br /><br />25i is the other people recommend for visuals but it&#039;s mostly eye candy (pretty clear-headed). Combined with a mood lift, you end up feeling like everything you see is new and pretty and amazing. <br /><br />25g is the newest one, not too many people have posted trip reports on it but there are a few on BlueLight. Foxymeow says her chemists are synthesizing it and should be here in a few weeks.
