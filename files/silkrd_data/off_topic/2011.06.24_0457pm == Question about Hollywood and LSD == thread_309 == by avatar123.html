				Why the hell acid is so strong in movies, like hippie movies, and in real life is weak? Really, i had visuals only once, the first time, a double face avatar, and the visuals were weak. LSA is weak, and Salvia is ok, but not the trip that i want.<br /><br />What should I use to see things like in the movies? <br />

				Depends on how aware you are as a person, the more aware the less you are fooled into seeing things that arent there. Its really a matter of experience.

				I&#039;d have to disagree with that one. On my intense trips I&#039;m tripping so hard that the concept of reality doesn&#039;t even exist anymore so I see anything my mind makes up.

				^agreed, try taking more then one, look at the movie Taking Woodstock for instance, very realistic &quot;basic&quot; visuals of LSD and the come up of stronger ones. Look at the size of the tabe he takes, to be honest it looks like its 4 tabs, its solid but its huge, back in the 60&#039;s it wasnt about money, it was legal for years and was still very easy to find years after prohibition started. Now when they cut it its much smaller (1/4). Many hippies have told me they started frying when they staretd coming out with four way split tabs, which are now sold as individual hits.
