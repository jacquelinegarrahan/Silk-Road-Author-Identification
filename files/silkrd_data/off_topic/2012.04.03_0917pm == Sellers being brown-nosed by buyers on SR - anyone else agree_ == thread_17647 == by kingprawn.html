				Hey guys, not a major post but just wondering does anyone else feel that a large amount of buyers on this forum are pathetic kiss-asses?<br /><br />I mean I appreciate a good vendor and the efforts they go thru for better security and quality - but ive read stuff like &quot;XXX is god-like&quot;, &quot;He&#039;s the man&quot; etc. Some of these posters act like they&#039;ve been given the stuff for free. If you pay for something you should expect good service.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean to come of as ungrateful - cos that&#039;s not what I&#039;m focusing on - it&#039;s the extent of almost lack of self-worth shown in these posts - the way these lot put sellers on a pedestal. It&#039;s the same way if you drop a pen and some picks it up for you, there is an extent you would say thanks before you came off as pathetic.<br /><br />Just to clarify further, it&#039;s the certain individual who posts like this I am talking about - Im not particularly focusing on the on the seller/quality of seller&#039;s product/seller&#039;s service etc.<br /><br />Just my opinions guys - wanna know what yours are

				Hhhmmm, well, you ever tried your hand at professional online vending? I would say that 90% of these vendors ARE god/goddess-like. <br />They risk their entire life and freedom for us. They work so hard, it would make your fucking head spin. It&#039;s much different than sitting in your house and selling little bags of weed, or other drugs. These people sit on HUGE quantities. <br />Just imagine that your day went like theirs: Wake up, take shower, eat. Put on gloves, start weighing out hundreds of packages, seal, seal again, maybe even again, take the time to go through HUNDREDS of messages, ON TOR, a bit slower, right? Then print all those addresses, stick them on, seal the box/envelope, add stamps, drive to a blue box to make the drop. That&#039;s &quot;in a nutshell&quot;. Imagine if you had 100+ orders to fulfill per day, and had to go through all these steps for your, and our security. <br />You know vac sealers are slow, printers are slow, sticking on labels is slow. It&#039;s fucking WORK.<br />This isn&#039;t street level drug dealing. And I find you ungrateful. <br />I am curious which vendors you have been ungrateful to, now. <br />It&#039;s not even close to being comparable to someone picking up a fucking pen for me. Seriously?!? <br />If you saw how my last order came, maybe you&#039;d be more appreciative of the time, money, and work that goes into vending. <br />Can&#039;t wait to see some vendors sound off here! <br /><br />Thanks for assuming I have a lack of self-worth, because I find what these people do to be awe inspiring. <br />

If you are calling your typical successful ebay seller to a God simply because they got your beanie babies to you on time, you got problems. There is a big difference between other online markets and the SR, so there should be a distinguishable difference when you offer praise to SR vendors.<br /><br />&quot;Just imagine that your day went like theirs: Wake up, take shower, eat. Put on gloves, start weighing out hundreds of packages, seal, seal again, maybe even again, take the time to go through HUNDREDS of messages, ON TOR, a bit slower, right? Then print all those addresses, stick them on, seal the box/envelope, add stamps, drive to a blue box to make the drop. That&#039;s &quot;in a nutshell&quot;. Imagine if you had 100+ orders to fulfill per day, and had to go through all these steps for your, and our security.<br />You know vac sealers are slow, printers are slow, sticking on labels is slow. It&#039;s fucking WORK.&quot;<br /><br /><br />While I acknowledge that what you described is indeed work, I am wondering what you think is so hard about what you described. Waking up, taking a shower, eating...um, okay, we all have to do that at one point or another I guess, weighing out &quot;hundreds of packages...&quot; hundreds huh? Hmmmm...I hope someone who has hundreds of orders to fill a day isn&#039;t selling such small quantities to diminish the risk vs. reward principle, so assuming that they aren&#039;t, then this will certainly be worth it to them, and it is POSSIBLE for more than one person to be involved with the work. Then there&#039;s printing addresses, sticking them on, sealing the boxes, putting on the stamps, driving to the post, (I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t mention breathing in and out, turning your head to look at X, then turning your head again to look at Y, putting your left foot forward, then your right, then your left again, then your right, etc., extending out your arm, opening the mail box, putting the package into the mail slot, closing the mail slot...etc.) What you described actually sounds like pretty easy work, and considering that there&#039;s no boss on your ass all day about his TPS reports or whatever, if the seller is making the kind of money that he/she should be making, this should be a fucking dream job compared to some of the jobs that I have had. And if the money isn&#039;t right, then either charge more, or shut down the business.<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is why you don&#039;t mention why some of these sellers should REALLY be elevated to iconic status, and that attributable to the type of business that they are in. The fact that these sellers have to deal with suppliers who are most often ruthless criminals who you can&#039;t just contact and say &quot;I have a complaint regarding my previous order,&quot; or &quot;I think your price is a little on the high side,&quot; and that they have to keep illegal stash hidden from not only law enforcement, but people who would rob them, and that the risk of holding with intent to distribute these products carries a long weight at your local correctional facility, and we aren&#039;t talking about a country club white collar prison, but the proverbial &quot;pound you in the ass&quot; penitentiary, in addition to the fact that simply mailing a parcel with drugs in it is a federal rap, AND that they still have to deal with the possibility that one of their buyers is going to screw them over with no possibility of recourse, dealing with the hassles of Bitcoin currency fluctuation...these are the REAL reasons that the sellers should be praised. I hope the difference is clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

You mentioned about SR vs Ebay point - i agree there is a difference too and the vendor could be given more praise then you would to the ebay vendor - but the point of my original post was the extent of the difference. These lame idiots here are just pathetic and are giving them 100x more. No names mentioned (SuperDimitri)<br /><br />Your final paragraph is an occupation choice they made because they wanna get paid. Maybe some like the Grateful Dead Family had a purpose - but I guarantee you the majority of vendors here just wanna see some $$$ - and as far as im concerned they chose those risks.

				I totally agree where Kingprawn is coming from but agree more with SD. Its true that sometimes reviews are over the top and therefor sound a bit like those telsell commercials but I believe these people are genuinly excited. I mean, for most of the buyers its their first time playing part in a international drugs smuggling scheme which looks like ebay and has better quality available then most places and then actually getting the product safely and getting away with it all also must give a rush. I remember when my first pack of MDMA arrived at my first online customer ever, I was like ZOMGGG!!!111~~~ IT ACTUALLY WORKED LOLOLOL, I can only imagine buyers have the same reaction when they get their first pack from SR and they then cant tell anyone irl about it so they will come to the forums and share their euphoria. To each his own ;)

				I don&#039;t get why it matters to anyone else if a buyer posts in this manner.&nbsp; Who gives a shit if they seem to have &quot;lack of self worth&quot;, or are &quot;pathetic kiss-asses&quot;.&nbsp; Surely that is their business?<br /><br />If you&#039;re a vendor who doesn&#039;t like people kissing your ass, just don&#039;t serve them any more.&nbsp; I&#039;ll be happy to take them off your hands when I get my shit up and running.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If you are a buyer, just mind your own business, and let others do the same.&nbsp; Who cares how other people conduct their affairs.&nbsp; &quot;judge not, lest ye be judged&quot;, or some bollocks like that.<br /><br />No offense to anyone, just stating my stance.

				May not sound like work to some, but it takes away from much of a personal life, if they even have one at all. <br />You can talk all the smack about me you want. I don&#039;t care.

				Kingprawn, <br /><br />I guess it really is one of those things you can put your finger on. By that I mean, what is the actually threshold when it goes from being acceptable praise to being &quot;brown nosing&quot; or &quot;pathethic?&quot; Seems quite arbitrary and based on your personal sensibility. <br /><br />I mean after all, you said:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I understand excitement, i understand enthusiasm</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Well everyone has a different way of expressing that. Not for nothing, but some can be high when they leave feedback or make posts here. And in some cases, it appears that a life or two was actually saved by a vendor and their product. There&#039;s a whole thread about it. <br /><br />I say, live an let live. The most they, who &quot;brown nose&quot; or whatever that actually means, can do is give a 5 out of 5. And in the end, it&#039;s the seller&#039;s percent rating that matters. The &quot;pathetic&quot; praise, again whatever that is, will be cycled out of the feedback column quite quickly for active sellers. <br /><br />So no worries brother. Walk good.<br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know. What&#039;s sad is when some do that to a seller who turns out to be a scammer. I feel bad for those who got duped in a web of trust. <br /><br />But for those who overly praise beyond confirming that the seller is good and reliable... I don&#039;t know their walk in life. Being able to reliably buy drugs from the safety of their homes may be a night and day situation for them given their past dealings with street thugs and the like or the conflict of interest that comes from buying from a friend(s). And some vendors do go out of their way to make some clients happy. Even giving some freebies or over weight quantity. So if someone wants to pour on the praise then lay it on thick, I can&#039;t think less of them for that. <br /><br />They might look weak and lame in some cases, but who am I to rain on their parade? After all, there are those who think anyone taking drugs is weak and lame. I&#039;d rather a community this be where we respect one another and tolerate each others&#039; idiosyncrasies. <br /><br />That&#039;s my opinion anyway.

				I may not be a huge vendor on SR, certainly no god ;D but I am a vendor nonetheless. I pride myself on honesty and reliability in all of my dealings, something that was quite lacking in my experiences with the face to face &#039;dealers&#039; I&#039;ve dealt with in the past.<br /><br />What I ask from my buyers is honest feedback. If it&#039;s short, it&#039;s short, if it&#039;s late, it&#039;s late (has never happened yet!). I agree, some buyers leave stupid feedback and aren&#039;t as objective as they should be rating vendors. I see a lot of &#039;OMG I got powder thru da mail itz best coke eva im gonna marry vendor XXXXX&#039;. The long term success of SR depends on objective, consistent feedback and good discussion. <br /><br />On the other hand being a vendor can be immensely tiring, require significant up front expense and be a full time (or more!) job in itself. I have immense respect for the huge vendors I know and cannot fathom how they handle the volume they do. <br /><br />The USPS delays we&#039;ve seen recently and the normal international delays are totally out of vendors hands. But the packaging, product and communication is not. The best vendors excel in those areas; some get lazy. Buyers should look for all of this and provide feedback accordingly.<br /><br />As for me, SR has been one hell of a ride, I share what I can with the community and enjoy subverting drug prohibition in the safest and most communal way I know how :)

				I don&#039;t see anything wrong with showing your appreciation for a vendor who goes above and beyond. The whole point of leaving a review is to state how happy one is with the transaction. Why pretend to be less excited or happy about a positive experience just to not come off as &quot;lame&quot;? When did finding enjoyment in a positive experience become something to be ashamed of? Kind of sounds like a thought one of those No-fun allowed LEO&#039;s who are trying to destroy this place might have. <br /><br /><br />On another note, I wonder if maybe some make a point to leave &quot;overly&quot; positive feedback out of a sense of fear? I can definitely see why it would be unsettling to some to be on bad terms with a drug vendor who has their address. I don&#039;t at all mean to imply that any vendors here are immoral people, but think about it. Our greatest piece of armor on this site is anonymity, which means you never really know who you are buying from, and should a situation ever arise in which a vendor you had a sour deal with begins to threaten you, what are you going to do? Call the police?<br /><br />That&#039;s my 2 cents on the issue

				I just got 50 orders over the weekend and most of them were smaller orders. That meant packaging, making 2c-b smarties, and making 25i for a good 6 hours since I like to make everything perfect. I literally passed out after 4 hours of packaging and than passed out covered in bubble envelopes and with my gloves still on. So then I wake up and figure since I have my gloves still on might as well finish packaging. I was only able to finish packaging the smarties in the morning so I go around and deliver it to multiple post offices, then go buy stamps, pack up 25i using completely different packaging from the smarties so they don&#039;t get linked than proceed to drive to every post office in my town. Add that to the fact that I had some express orders to send out and you understand why it is hard as fuck to be a vendor. I literally stayed up all night packaging, passed out, somehow managed to wake up early, packaged some more, than went to school on 4 hours of sleep, than went back to it.<br /><br />Yeah, vending is great and I find it very rewarding because I can give a great product for you guys but it is fucking exhausting.

It&#039;s the same way if you drop a pen and some picks it up for you, there is an extent you would say thanks before you came off as pathetic.<br /><br />Just to clarify further, it&#039;s the certain individual who posts like this I am talking about - Im not particularly focusing on the on the seller/quality of seller&#039;s product/seller&#039;s service etc.<br /><br />Just my opinions guys - wanna know what yours are<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Unless you AREN&#039;T an active drug user and AREN&#039;T waiting like a kid on x-mas everyday staking out your mailbox.. then I don&#039;t see why you&#039;d buy from SR to begin with.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t even mentioning people who source for customers IRL.<br /><br />Who wouldn&#039;t kiss ANY vendor&#039;s feet who has provided them with a QUALITY product they may have not seen for 20+ years. <br /><br />Vendors need FEEDBACK. <br /><br />Vendors need APPRECIATION. <br /><br />Vendors need INITIATIVE to continue their hard work. <br /><br />Does this make sense?<br /><br />***************************<br />Me and my friends enjoy the drugs that we finally have access to after years of a dry-spell, and will continue to kiss ANY vendor&#039;s feet and/or ass that comes through for us.&nbsp; Period. <br /><br />C&#039;mon man, if you were a vendor wouldn&#039;t you want some A+++ feedback?<br /><br />Don&#039;t know about you, but I&#039;d rather have a long-term connect/ friend/ supplier than simply a cordial &quot;hey thanks, good product&quot; through the SR finalization system.<br /><br />Maybe that&#039;s just me...<br /><br />***************************<br />Lol, I&#039;m watching Always Sunny... in the words of Charlie Kelly: &quot;Sometimes you&#039;ve got to crack a few eggs to make an omelet!&quot; ;) <br /><br />Have a good 1 bro,<br />-jtemp<br /><br />Mitanox sums what I&#039;ve had to say to an extent: <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17647.msg175957#msg175957">Quote from: Mitanox on April 03, 2012, 11:11 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I totally agree where Kingprawn is coming from but agree more with SD. Its true that sometimes reviews are over the top and therefor sound a bit like those telsell commercials but I believe these people are genuinly excited. I mean, for most of the buyers its their first time playing part in a international drugs smuggling scheme which looks like ebay and has better quality available then most places and then actually getting the product safely and getting away with it all also must give a rush. I remember when my first pack of MDMA arrived at my first online customer ever, I was like ZOMGGG!!!111~~~ IT ACTUALLY WORKED LOLOLOL, I can only imagine buyers have the same reaction when they get their first pack from SR and they then cant tell anyone irl about it so they will come to the forums and share their euphoria.

				It doesn&#039;t matter if I buy a burger at McDonald&#039;s or anything here on SR, politeness is a must.<br />I thank everyone.&nbsp; Who gives a fuck if it&#039;s &quot;their job&quot; to sell you shit, no matter what job you do you want to feel valued.&nbsp; These days half the places you visit the vendors don&#039;t even look at you.&nbsp; Our techno-society is afraid to talk face to face, and even worse, looks down on those of us who do interact properly. (Tip: when somebody thanks you, don&#039;t ignore them like an awkward fuck... say, &quot;You&#039;re welcome!&quot;)<br /><br />DON&#039;T EVER put someone down for being thankful. I know vendors here are not gods, we are all people... but the people who heap a disproportionate amount of praise are maybe coming from places where these substances aren&#039;t available, or they cannot get a script, or they are just plain in-need.<br /><br />So called &quot;fanbois&quot; defend their vendors because the vendors have proven themselves.&nbsp; If you do not agree, state why in your feedback and move on.&nbsp; You may not be happy, but you don&#039;t have to try to change the minds of their fans who are already happy with the service.&nbsp; Crushed weed is like, the least of anyone&#039;s worries.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t affect the product in any way but appearance.&nbsp; It&#039;s called mail-order... if you want virgin buds, order larger quantities or get something locally.<br /><br />Personally, I don&#039;t just wrap a single bud up into a paper and smoke it without first grinding it up or otherwise altering it&#039;s appearance.&nbsp; Once you place your crushed bud into the grinder... it will come out the same way a non-crushed bud would.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				SD,<br /><br />Did you pick up he is a cannabis dealer?<br />I always think it&#039;s in poor taste for one dealer to rank on the other vendors unless there is a scam.<br />But Mr Dank is a hoot like the dude moonbear.<br />We just mess with him. Hopefully he doesn&#039;t open another vendor account ::) <br /><br /><br />Thanks for the compliment, it really takes a lot of work.<br />Hopefully all of us posting reviews make our community a little better.<br />Like picking up the piece of paper on the ground, and tossing in the trash. <br /><br />As far as flat weed loosing potency, nobody in the US offers sativa like the Canucks do.

				I totally agree with you dude, there are people here that are such fucking kiss asses, its pathetic!&nbsp; A good dealer doesnt need his ass kissed and would probably shy away from it, its actually embarrassing.&nbsp; My speculation though is that alot of these kiss asses are actually shills who are meant to make that particular dealer look good (better than what they really are)<br /><br />REAL great dealers DON&#039;T need their asses kissed, period.&nbsp; It&#039;s ok to be thankfull and thank the dealer from time to time, but draw a line goddammit, be a man and have some balls.&nbsp; Theres no need to be super thankful, its not like these dealers are giving away free drugs, you are paying them money so why the need to thank them so much?
