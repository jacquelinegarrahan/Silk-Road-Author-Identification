				anybody watching the weather channel? Looks like another Katrina getting ready to hit New Orleans. I&#039;m thinking about going on down to volunteer to help clean that mess up. Florida is fucked. Over 48,000 without power.<br /><br />So now is a good time to stock pile as many gallons of gas as you can and then re sell it at 5 bucks a gallon because it&#039;s going up to ten bucks a gallon. If it goes that high you can charge 9 a gallon. They have already evacuated the oil rigs. I dont mean to sound un compassionate or anything. Like I said I may go volunteer to help

				I just learned a strange fun fact&nbsp; :-\, my bday (very end of Aug.) is tied to the worst hurricanes in American history, because the gulf is hotter at the end of August, which is what the hurricanes thrive on.<br />Katrina, Camille, Wilma(formed Aug 28th), 1935 Labor Day Hurricane(formed Aug. 29th) Rita, Gustav, Irene, Bonnie, etc. just some examples. It has made for some crap birthdays thats for sure. No power, sweating bullets, annoyed because of the heat, can&#039;t go anywhere or do anything. It just plain sucks, but this one is only a cat 2, I&#039;ve played on the beach during cat 2&#039;s. We&#039;d put trash bags on (because the beach sand feels like needles hitting your skin), poke out some eye holes, put goggles on top of that, wear some golashes, and have some of the most fun I&#039;ve ever had in my life. We&#039;d fill up a water jug, tie a really long rope to it, go get up to a high dune on the beach, and throw that bitch in the air and watch how far the wind could carry that much weight. It&#039;s pretty fun when you&#039;re 11-14 yrs old. Shit, I would still have fun doing that. I do realize that hurricanes are destructive and do take lives, so I&#039;m not trying to downplay the seriousness of that aspect.

				I&#039;m on the Gulf Coast near N.O. This storm isn&#039;t expected to be anywhere close to Katrina; it&#039;s hardly a Cat 1. I don&#039;t see much chance for profit. :p

				Gas prices are still expected to go up a bit because of oil rigs shutting down, probably some processing plants shutting down along the gulf as well, although I highly doubt this would be a profitable opportunity for the average person, unless you get a job to go help clean up the mess that Isaac leaves.

				yea but they keep saying that it&#039;s moving really slow and getting stronger. They didn&#039;t rate katrina a 4 until they assesed the damage. the aftermath is really what rates it. They have already evacuated the oil rigs. You better believe that the big oil companies will hike up prices just for the hell of it even if it doesnt do much. They will use the media as an excuse to hike up prices. I&#039;d like to go down and help clean up the mess. I need to do a little volunteer work to make up for some of the wrong I&#039;ve done in my life. My neighbor just moved here from there and he was there during katrina. he worked down there for shell oil. I&#039;m a true blue volunteer. Some of my kin died at the alamo and others in the civil war. My dad was killed in vietnam 25 years after it was over with agent orange. He&#039;s buried at a veterans cemetary with vietnam on his tombstone. I really miss him a lot.

				have you all seen the latest on Issac? Its hit land and now it&#039;s a cat 1 so far. I expect it to tear up hell. I expect another one after it. Issac is the I&#039;s and Katrina was the K&#039;s
