				Saw a piece on 60 minutes about this awhile back.&nbsp; Basically a complex computer virus was used to covertly sabotage Iran&#039;s uranium enrichment programs by making their centrifuges spin at a speed that would damage them, all while keeping the scientists monitoring the centrifuges from being able to detect any unusual activity.&nbsp; No confirmation of the source, but experts seems to agree that it had to have been a government sponsored operation most likely originating in the US or Israel or both.&nbsp; More info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet<br /><br />Basically I find this fascinating because it shows just how capable the United States government is in utilizing complex cyber-technology to further their interests on the global stage.&nbsp; I also find it a far more subversive and intelligent tactic than a lot of the imperialist cowboy shit the US tends to be known for.&nbsp; I guess the only reason this is relevant to SR is that essentially we should be very careful about underestimating what the government is truly capable of when it comes to technology and infiltration.

				i was also interested in this and actually found some of the source code although somewhat broken couldn&#039;t make head nor tail of it and scrapped looking into it any further, although upon inspection i did notice it didn&#039;t seem like the kind of virus a government would create i firmly believe it was adapted from a domestic use and they have probably stolen the main body of the source code from some hacker, my reasoning for this is it seems to be a complex way of collecting botnets but with the SCADA attack bolted on, i.e. the old code probably just collected botnets and waited for instructions, after editing them the us government set it to collect botnets then attack siemens SCADA based systems of there choice.<br /><br />but thats just my opinon ;)
