				A little background: I&#039;ve been interested in science for as long as I, or anyone else, can remember. Since I could read, I&#039;ve branched out into more topics than I can count. Something funny cropped up though. Whenever I would read about things like abiogenesis or psychopharmacology I noticed I could follow the chemical reasoning at a cursory level, but not with any depth, despite a childhood interest in this topic that sort of went by the wayside over the years. As I set about putting an end to this, I realized that, when the time is right, drug synthesis and distribution will present a unique challenge, integrating competence from a broad spectrum of fields into a single encompassing, demanding experience.<br /><br />Namely, I have methamphetamine in mind. It&#039;s popular, I doubt it will stop being popular in the coming years, and so few cooks show any pride in their work.<br /><br />My plan is not to be put into effect for some years hence, but now&#039;s as good a time in any to expose its weaknesses. I will be looking for jobs in the Silicon Valley before long, which will obviously take me out to California. After some years in a respectable technical career, having attained a respectable age, I will look for a change of career northwards, most likely something less demanding, in the Pacific NW. The client base is large, which will make it relatively easy to ship from addresses of those convicted of meth-related offenses, and the local foliage should make concealment of certain operations easier. I will seek a house in a wooded area out of prying eyes and take up roots there, building a clandestine lab underground a respectful distance from the house, exposed only by the ventilation system (which will be concealed to the greatest extent possible) and a smallish hatch. In my home proper, I will run a legitimate chemistry (and electronics, etc.) lab in the basement and put a lot of work into it. After all, I do really like this kind of thing. (Any tips on diverting equipment and chemicals from licit to illicit purposes would be nice ... should I e.g. destroy receipts or what?)<br /><br />And from there ... well if I&#039;m already taking huge risks, there&#039;s no sense in making them any larger. For one thing, I don&#039;t want to be cooking day and night. I will not make a career out of it. A few moles of very high quality every few months. That&#039;s it really. Just one mole of pure shit is worth a hell of a lot of money given the investment, and I&#039;ve never really been about money. Enough money to keep me and my relatively frugal endeavors afloat, pay down my debts, and furnish a decent retirement for my parents, and eventually me, would be good enough.<br /><br />A laundry list of other risk management strategies follows:<br /><br />* I have a shitton of chemical process safety texts, including a few by the famous Trevor Kletz. I will be following that advice at the laboratory scale very closely.<br />* I will do my damndest to distance myself from direct precursors. Nothing on List I or List II will be bought. When I&#039;m up to speed on chemoinformatics, automated retrosynthesis techniques could be awfully useful here.<br />* I WILL NOT USE. NEVER EVER EVER EVER. (Not even on my deathbed. I think I&#039;d rather go like Aldous Huxley did, the psychedelic way.)<br />* Whenever possible, reactions will be performed with the oversight of inexpensive microcontrollers ... a lot of laboratory equipment can be gotten with RS232 or similar interfaces and it&#039;d be a shame to pass up on that opportunity.<br />* Waste products will be neutralized and disposed of in an inconspicuous manner.<br />* The lab will be excavated away from natural lines of drift and will be spacious, not cramped. Both of these things will probably make the construction more arduous and that&#039;s OK.<br />* Storage of digital wallets, keys, passphrases, etc. will be somewhere in the cloud, and steganographic; the coder/decoder, written by me (no signature from ready-made software) will be stored somewhere else online where I can retrieve it to a live CD, use it, and then discard it without a trace. This will allow plausible deniability and prevent any potential subpoenas of my data.<br />* In between now and then, I will observe law enforcement forums, read up on clandestine lab bust cases, and stay abreast of academic forensic literature. That&#039;s a reward in itself because it&#039;s fun reading.<br />* No handwritten labels. I&#039;ll use a popular font, too.<br />* My packages will all be vacuum sealed and stuffed in something innocent. (The sealer will be stored in the lab, not in the house.)<br />* But the house, and my car, will have a few well-designed hidey-holes in case of a surprise visit.<br />* I will follow the FBI&#039;s own advice regarding P2P currency. :)<br />* Etc. ... you get the picture.<br /><br />While I have put a lot of forethought into my plan, there&#039;s never any sense in getting smug in a situation like this, and I would not hesitate to pass up on practical wisdom garnered here. Shoot...

				If ya gunna do it do it, I&#039;m not sure why you have posted this here. Also why are you being so specific in a forum where LE and journalists are known to watch? Bizarre. <br /><br />However if you decide to do this and want the lab equipment give me a shout, you can see what I have available on my SR page and I can get a range of sizes for reactors/centrifuges and any sized glassware. <br /><br />From reading what you have put it seems you are more pipe-dreaming than actually going to do it, it was certainly not my mindset but there you go.

				Starting with methamphetamine might be a good idea, you can start with basic synths and work your way up to more complex, higher yielding ones. But there is some real money to be made in MDMA. About $1000 of glassware is needed for a simple, few day long synthesis that only requires a few years of advanced chemistry knowledge. $300 of common, unwatched chemicals can easily yield, if done properly, several thousand dollars worth of MDMA. It&#039;s not difficult once you get the hang of it and many steps can be preformed at once after you learn how to stagger the steps. Only one of the steps is even relatively risky, it&#039;s a wacker oxidation, and that&#039;s really not too bad if you know what&#039;s going on in that reaction. I&#039;d recommend moving to MDMA once you&#039;re comfortable. You can sell crystal, powder, pills, and capsules, reaching a very large audience.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like help with glassware (not obtaining, but knowledge and help with setups and use) or syntheses of Methamphetamine or MDMA, let me know, as I have a lot of experience in these areas. Best of luck to you, always exciting to see another synther getting started.
