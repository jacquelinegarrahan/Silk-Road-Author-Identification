				Not sure if this belongs in the official NBOME discussion thread but I figured it made enough sense to make a new thread.<br /><br />I had been doing pyschs for 2 years before I tried NBOME.&nbsp; I loved it - it was cheap, I had wonderful afterglows, and I made really interesting art while tripping. <br />So, I decided to get 50 tabs of 25C, and some 25I considering how cheap it was.<br /><br />This summer I took 2 tabs (enough for a +++ trip) every two weeks (enough for tolerance to wear off).&nbsp; Now I&#039;ve noticed that it had lasting effects.&nbsp; Whenever I get really sleepy, or drunk or high, a small spinning kaleidoscope of colors appears far off in the center of my vision.&nbsp; It&#039;s fairly easy to ignore so it hasn&#039;t affected work or anything but it is definitely noticeable and definitely real.&nbsp; Sometimes its fun but sometimes I feel kind of fucked up that I&#039;ve permanently rewired my brain with this drug.&nbsp; I decided to lay off NBOME until it goes away, but it&#039;s been several months and I&#039;m not sure it ever will.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken shrooms and acid plenty and smoked plenty of weed too and nothing triggered HPPD except NBOME.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a horrible drug and you shouldn&#039;t take it but I guess reminding everyone that it is not a totally harmless psychedelic and it should be taken, like all other drugs, in moderation.<br />

You should try focusing on it next time, though. Explore if there is a greater connection to the effect.<br /><br />I think... this is pure mystical-type speculation, but I would think that it didn&#039;t so much as rewire your brain but open it up, though. When I get sleepy or high(never been drunk) I tend to have greater access to my subconscious mind, myself. So my first thought is that you just have a stronger connection, that wasn&#039;t there before.

				Yep... NBOMe seems to make HPPD very real. One of my sellers says he hasn&#039;t felt the same since he went ham with these tabs. A couple of his customers ended up in the hospital from the tabs, one had some sort of heart blockage (I think cardiac arrest), the other just freaked the fuck out because he wasn&#039;t experienced with drugs at all.<br /><br />NBOMe sounds evil from all of these reports, but a very large majority of my customers and sellers have enjoyed it so far. Just like with any other drug, things can go bad if you don&#039;t use responsibly and do your research.

				I once noticed about a week after a 25i trip that colors seemed very noticeably vivid and trippy. It went away after a few hours.

				Wow.&nbsp; Thank you very much for sharing your experience here.&nbsp; Over the past decade I have really tried to stick with the natural psychedelics - shrooms, mescaline - while doing a little LSD here and there.<br /><br />Since arriving at the road I have been reading so much about NBOMe and good experiences others have had and it has made me very interested to try it.&nbsp; I just placed an order for a variety of B, C, D, and I tabs to add to my party safe which are on the way.<br /><br />This post definitely has me reconsidering ever taking them myself.

Especially that this is a research chemical, and on a personal note, that I am just beginning to experiment with it, myself. I had a similar experience some years back with psilocybin, which I&#039;d been indulging in in ever greater doses and finally cut back, only to find after some time that indulging in even a little brought on the depths of psychedelia - which shouldn&#039;t have been happening - and it raised the same concern in me: &quot;Fuck, this has changed me. This is a lasting change.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it will be the same with NBOMe and I don&#039;t want to suggest anything other than a rational, factual approach, but I will just add for whatever small comfort it provides that I think this effect wore off eventually with me. Completely different drug; possibly a complete non sequitur, I admit, but there you go.<br /><br />Again, thanks for putting this report in.

				Similar thing happened with me regarding 2ci and 2ce. I tried to introduce it to my town and therfor tripped whenever I sold some to make the others comfortable. Eventually I had a 2ce trip were the chest bodyload didn&#039;t go away for about a week and a half. Certain patterns still will always move if I stare at them long enough. Bathroom tiles and walls would still breathe every once in a while. It slowly went away and since then I took a&nbsp; 6 month break from 2c&#039;s and I have been plugging them ever since with no issues.<br />BTW 2ci+mdma= AMAZING
