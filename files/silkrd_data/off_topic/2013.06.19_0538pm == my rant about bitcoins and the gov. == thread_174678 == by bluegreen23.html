				So ... in the US you&#039;re more or less fucked for bitcoins without having some kind of trail to you. I know I know you can plug in names and birthdays all day long and eventually hit gold. How long til they cripple that? <br /><br />canada went the other way, the gov said &quot;cool beans we don&#039;t know whats up A. so do things and we&#039;ll try to figure what it&#039;s all aboooooot&quot; yay ! Then the banks basically said &quot;yeah.. but wait.. go fuck yourselves&quot; and started closing accounts for no particular reason. <br /><br />the EU ... fucked if I even know but it doesn&#039;t seem good.<br /><br />So it seems like there are 2 options. I&#039;m working on one.. slowly.&nbsp; That is to work without bank accounts. Hard to do but shit what other choice do you have when they are going to stone wall you. <br /><br />The other option is well out of my control, and that is to have people accept it for goods and services. When I can buy groceries with bitcoins I don&#039;t need to give a rats ass about trying to convert them to useable currency. <br /><br />So pissed that every day there&#039;s more BS and more attempted control. I mean shit we need an ebay + amazon that functions with bitcoins. if 2 companies that size were accepting for .. well pretty much every because they sell everything then boom. we are in business. <br /><br />This is my angry frustration. trying to start a small but useful exchange is getting harder by the day.

				Well Blue Sky Traders have managed to not get their accounts closed and they used to be active on the SR forums and are based on a hidden service... <br />I think it&#039;s possible to start a small exchange that works without having to give some sort of identification.. Maybe it&#039;s because they don&#039;t have much volume and only accept up to $8500 per transaction (below $10000).

				wasn&#039;t really looking for a solution. More just making a comment on how things are shaping up. bitcoins to me seem like they are at this fragile age. They are to public to be ignored and just a techno-savy experiment. But they aren&#039;t big enough to command it&#039;s own fate. <br /><br />The solution to this really comes down to real stores accepting them. As long as we are trading back into hard currency then it&#039;s just a middle man operation for easy transport of wealth. The unfortunate part is that the suppliers of goods at the top of the chain are going to be the hard ones to get on board. <br /><br />The illustration of this is a coffee shop. Though the forward thinking progressive coffee shop may accept bitcoin payments they can&#039;t pay their rent with bitcoins, their electricity, their water, their coffee beans, their wages, etcetcetc. <br />Until more people accept them as payment they will continue to be in this void zone that they are currently in, where the government is able to regulate through outside influences such as registering, or closing bank accounts. <br /><br />

				Canadafag here.<br /><br />Recently (~1-2 weeks ago) my main method of deposit got shut down. It was a direct bank deposit, not needing any details, no ID, etc. You just go to the bank, deposit $X into X account, and you have your money in their site within about an hour. That certain bank closed their account and now I can&#039;t use that method. Luckily there&#039;s other banks I can use to do the same method, but now I&#039;m worried on how long they&#039;re going to last.<br /><br />We&#039;re going though a rough time with the Bitcoin right now, but I believe we&#039;ll keep pushing though&nbsp; ;D
