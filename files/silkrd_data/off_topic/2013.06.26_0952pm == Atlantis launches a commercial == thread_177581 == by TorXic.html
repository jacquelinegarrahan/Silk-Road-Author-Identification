				LE mostly want the dealers, not buyers. There aren&#039;t enough cells in the world to lock up all the users. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s LE, they charge for a vendor account. I&#039;m sure that wouldn&#039;t be allowed, and people have bought from it. And this vid would be entrapment. I think it&#039;s competition, and they may have been responsible for the DoS attacks, but I also am not sure, I think the attacks could have been solely to drop the price of BTC, like the attacks on MtGox and Bitstamp. The attacker of MtGox made his intentions very clear from the get go that it was to drop the price of BTC as it shot up so much.

				I haven&#039;t even been to the page and I refuse to. Won&#039;t go. It&#039;s a honeypot. <br /><br />And NoAddedSugar, you realize that in order to GET the dealers they need to entice buyers, right? There&#039;s no way to get dealers if there are no buyers for their product.

				An article was written about this and is currently posted on a very popular news aggregator site...<br /><br />The article:<br />http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/26/4467136/illegal-online-drug-bazaar-begins-massive-advertising-push-atlantis-silk-road<br /><br /><br />Illegal online drug bazaar begins massive advertising push<br /><br /><br />In the world of illicit virtual marketplaces, there is one clear leader: Silk Road, which has been in business since February of 2011. However, a few competitors have recently sprung up. The most visible is Atlantis, which has completely discarded the paranoia and caution that usually accompanies the online drug-dealing industry. Today, the site announced it is planning a &quot;big social media campaign,&quot; which kicked off with a video ad done in the style of a cutesy Silicon Valley startup.<br /><br />The video opens with a cheery tune and a cartoon man in stunner shades and a tie. &quot;Meet Charlie,&quot; reads the narration. &quot;He&#039;s a stoner, and recently his job made him move cities, and he can&#039;t find any dank buds.&quot; The movie ends with Charlie getting &quot;high as a kite&quot; after using Atlantis, which the video is sure to note offers &quot;no fees for purchases&quot; and &quot;next day delivery.&quot;<br /><br />Atlantis has also been pitching journalists and offering discounts to top Silk Road sellers.<br /><br />Isn&#039;t it a bit indiscreet for Atlantis to advertise its illegal service so brazenly (and flout YouTube&#039;s user guidelines in the process)? Silk Road, by contrast, does not even advertise its address; it must be shared person-to-person or found by following links from deep-web sites such as The Hidden Wiki or other guides to the digital underground.<br /><br />It&#039;s very difficult for the police to crack down on either the operators or users of virtual marketplaces, however, so operating in the open may be the same as operating in the shadows. Owners can station themselves anywhere in the world, taking precautions to protect their identities. Atlantis and sites like it also operate completely under the table using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. These &quot;cryptocurrencies&quot; also offer users ways to protect their identities. Atlantis and sites like it are only accessible through Tor, the distributed network that anonymizes traffic by bouncing it between nodes around the world.<br /><br />&quot;We want to bring attention to the site and bring our vendors more buyers,&quot; a user purporting to be the CEO of Atlantis said on Reddit. &quot;Law enforcement is going to be aware of us (and probably already is) regardless of the way we choose to put our product out there.&quot;<br /><br />Atlantis says it has processed more than half a million dollars in sales since it opened in March, so the aggressive advertising strategy may be working. The company is also hiring an online marketer â€” to be paid in Bitcoin, of course.

				It is a little brazen to do it the way they&#039;re promoting it. Even if it is a big honey pot, how will that help them if they do not know the buyer&#039;s nor vendor&#039;s genuine address/information?<br /><br />One of the funny things about Atlantis is they went through the trouble to include a copyright notice on their pages. That just seems kind of odd. If you view the source of their pages you can see it&#039;s 100% custom code like SR (not some kind of commercial CMS). It just seems funny to include a copyright notice.

				For everyone saying Atlantis is a honeypot for LE, if LE was going to try to bust anyone they&#039;d target the site with more users and vendors not less.&nbsp; I thought the commercial was kind of funny.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think SR is a much better resource simply because it has more vendors which gives the buyer more of a choice, and there are way more forum reviews on SR than Atlantis.&nbsp; Calling Atlantis a honeypot for LE is kind of ridiculous though.&nbsp;

				This is definitely an interesting route they&#039;ve taken as this will permanently make them different from Silk Road, either they&#039;re going to crash and burn due to Law Enforcement or have a very real chance of competing with Silk Road in the long run. With that said the commercial itself had some major flaws, the main one being linking their TOR address without explaining what TOR itself is. I would reckon something like 95% of the people who saw the commercial who weren&#039;t aware of TOR beforehand won&#039;t research it in detail as they won&#039;t understand the connection, which is a bit unfortunate as they are no doubt the main demographic for the commercial itself. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re going to refine their commercial and/or get some site up explaining the TOR concept, but if they don&#039;t I don&#039;t think this commercial will have that much impact.<br /><br />Some say this is just giving the finger to Law Enforcement, but the Pirate Bay has doing this for years and it&#039;s still up: http://thepiratebay.sx/legal and they&#039;re not even on TOR network. What can be said for sure is if Atlantis continues down this road they will have a major advantage over Silk Road if legalization occurs in a couple of years and they&#039;re still up at that point in time.

				the commercial worked anyway, it&#039;s not an how-to buy drugs online, but a lot of talk about atlantis in a &quot;good&quot; way.<br />most of times SR articles are about someone get caught, security issue, ddoss, or something else.<br /><br />They are hiring, 2 position available: Marketing and SEO ( seo on tor! ), so it&#039;s just the begin.

				Anyone with the knowledge and resources required to set up something like SR/atlantis is almost certainly capable of making and posting a video on youtube with(near) complete anonymity. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think that atlantis/TBR will ever really get to the level SR is at, if for no other reason than the $500 deposit required to open a vendor account.&nbsp; Not only does it discourage(but not completely eliminate) scammers, it gives a sense of exclusivity, so the &quot;rabble&quot; from atlantis/TBR who can&#039;t afford the price of an SR vendor account won&#039;t be around.&nbsp; <br /><br />
