				Oh no you don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m winning the race to -1000 karma.<br /><br />I&#039;m the bad person here.<br /><br />I can&#039;t even spell, because of some pathetic backstory like not being allowed to attend school during childhood.<br /><br />Not that you should believe anything I have to say, since I&#039;m so evil.<br /><br />You want to give me the negative karma, because I&#039;m evil, and your expression of hatred gives me purpose. Karma means nothing outside this forum, so do not hold back.<br /><br />Unrelatedly, I seem to be dipping deeper into depression, so my viewpoint is increasingly morbid and despairing.<br /><br />Namely, humans suck. People that try to say human beings are special are full of shit. My dog is smarter than 99.98% of every human being on this planet.<br /><br />The only reason for this is because my dog is motivated, and not lazy.<br /><br />Most humans are lazy fucks, who care only for their own comfort and short-term welfare. They feel entitled to a comfortable life and everything should go their way simply because they exist. My dog is more worthy than all of those people.<br /><br />When I get like this, it reminds me about the truth. The truth is, most &quot;people&quot; on this planet are worse than animals, because they aren&#039;t even useful, they&#039;re loud, obnoxious, demanding without providing anything in return, and hide behind brigands and thieves to justify their sense of entitlement.<br /><br />I am sometimes a very sweet-natured person, but when the temporary relief from despair and rage ends, I cannot escape from the reality which is how unworthy the human race is.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how ugly humans are? Have you ever noticed how disgusting humans are? Some people say dogs are disgusting, but humans are far worse.<br /><br />To me, humans are divided and measured by one thing.<br /><br />Either you&#039;re a useful pathetic would-be slave, or you are a non-useful would-be slave.<br /><br />All humans, deep down, want to be enslaved. They crave the utter lack of responsibility over themselves and their behavior. They&#039;d rather blame anyone but themselves.<br /><br />If you think I think I&#039;m different, you are mistaken. I am the most evil and pathetic of them all.<br /><br />I do not want to live, the only thing keeping me alive are a small group of extremely devoted friends who want to serve me, and have sworn me their loyalty.<br /><br />Don&#039;t ask me why, I never asked for it, they just do things on their own, but even as evil as I am, I am a man of principle, and so, I have a moral imperative to protect those who have sworn loyalty to me, and I will destroy everything else to do so.<br /><br />If they have not triggered this pesky moral imperative, I would be allowed to suicide quietly, and the human scum would continue to exist where I would not longer be aware of it.<br /><br />In real life, I&#039;m somewhat shy, nerdy, quiet, everyone who hears me speak thinks I am incredibly intelligent, and some people who are not used to me seem breathtaken, which is cute.<br /><br />Maybe if I wasn&#039;t so depressed, maybe of moonflower could feed me LSD and MDMA, and force me to love myself, I would not want to die so much.<br /><br />I loath the body I was born into, I loath the species I was born into, I loath the weaknesses of my mind, and I loath you. So pelt me with your negative karma, and identify the Evil that I am.

I just don&#039;t take shit from wannabe shot callers here on the SRF&#039;s! Not going to happen! I just want to make a point how stupid and chicken shit the whole -/karma (or the +/karma as well!) is. I&#039;d like to meet the stupid fuck who thought that up and then the even more stupid fuck that allows it in ANYTHING that has Silk Road in it&#039;s name! What a cunt!
