				Hi All<br /><br />Supposing that I had the following details about an individual and wanted to get revenge for being scammed in the real world, what would be the best way of exacting revenge upon said person? <br /><br />Name/Address/Telephone<br />personal e-mail address<br />bank sortcode and account number<br /><br />This is not SR transaction related, more a customer who has been bouncing cheques for supplied (legal) goods.<br /><br />Many thanks in advance.

I understand that this is not what the forums are designed for and I agree wholeheartedly with your statements on agorism and freedom. <br /><br />However, sometimes the legal system fails to bring justice to those who deserve it and I am simply asking for people&#039;s ideas of how to make up for this shortcoming. The scammer in question is clearly a person who makes his entire living by screwing over small businesses and he appears to be able to do this and repeatedly get away with it. It has been followed up through all possible legal routes and now I am left with the choice of either just swallowing the loss and having to live with the fact that he will continue to lie, cheat and steal his way through life, or I can try to put into action that which Karma regularly fails to.<br /><br />I remember sometime ago that Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear fame foolishly published his bank details because he was so sure that nobody could scam him, lo and behold he found that he had made a substantial donation to the WWF or someone similar, wondered if perhaps this might be do-able?<br /><br />Thanks<br />
