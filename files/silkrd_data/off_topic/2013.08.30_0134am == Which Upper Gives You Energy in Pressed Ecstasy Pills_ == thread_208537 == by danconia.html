				I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all experienced them before.&nbsp; Long before SR existed plenty of us were getting random pressed pills from shady drug dealers before we went to our raves.&nbsp; Sometimes we&#039;d get bunk pills but sometimes we&#039;d feel high as fuck on ecstasy BUT had a lot more energy than what is typically experienced with MDMA alone.<br /><br />We&#039;ve heard the rumors that it was caffeine or meth... so what ingredient(s) was in those pills that made you dance energetically for hours on end?&nbsp; I thought it might have been MDA but I&#039;m hearing from others that this is not the case.&nbsp; Possibly another &quot;ecstasy&quot; chemical?&nbsp; Methylone?&nbsp; Mephodrone?<br /><br />What do you guys think?&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to chase down that sort of experience and see how it goes.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.

				Usually caffeine, speed, methylone or a combination thereof. You can find pills on the road that have combinations of all these. A lot of &quot;e&quot; pills now are in fact straight methylone.<br /><br />Edit: Sorry forgot to clarify, it&#039;s the speed that gives you the long term energy. Caffeine only gives a short boost and methylone is rather mellow compared to MDMA.

				I know precisely what you are talking about, the pills I used to get back in the early 90&#039;s would tear your face off and had you rushing so hard you would be bent over with your hands on your hips as the euphoria freight train knocked you out of your Adidas shell toes. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never found a pill or MDMA that has come close to recreating the effects of those early pills, I am also pretty confident no amount of caffeine, speed etc could create those effects either, there was definitely something different in them or the MDMA was different from what is produced today.

				Methamphetamine.&nbsp; It is cheap and was very common in ecstasy pills.

				One question I have pondered over is has the synthesis of MDMA changed over the the last 5 to 10 years? I am sure when I was actively researching ecstasy and mdma back in the day the manufacturing process did not involve the use of safrole oil, I may be completely wrong of course but I am sure the synthesis involved the use of other precursors, any budding chemists on here feel free to comment.

				Not to poop the party, but it might just be the &quot;loss of magic&quot; effect.<br /><br />Whilst the body high of E is pretty much constantly the same, the perceived energy and empathy effects depend strongly on set and setting. I know exactly what you mean, but in retrospect (been doing it since the late 90s) I think that the more accustomed I came to it the less &quot;amped&quot; I got from it. I seem to recall 12hr non-stop raving on 2 pills in 2000, nowadays 350mg crystal hardly carry me for more than 5 hrs energy-wise,despite the fact that I try to limit my uses to 2 or 3 times per year.<br /><br />Whoknows...
