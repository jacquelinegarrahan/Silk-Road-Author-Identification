				So, I tried heroin for the first time today and I have to say it was not really a fun time. I snorted about 100mg over a 1.5 hour period, it was good for the first 2 hours or so but I spend the next 3-4 hours after that puking scratching and feeling like a sketch ball. I really want to try an opiate I can enjoy and relax with.<br />Any one have suggestions on what products I should try? would morphine most likely be a bit much for me? I&nbsp; don&#039;t plan on being a regular so my tolerance will always be quite low and I am not looking for a huge rush just&nbsp; pleasant stoned feeling.<br />Any info would be much appreciated.

				Your not going to get a pleasant stoned feeling from any strong opiate, the nausea and scratching go hand in hand with the nods. I mean your regularly used opiates like morph and OC are gonna make u sick. I deal with it too, but I love the warm fuzzy feeling and nodding out is my fave. My suggestion would be to get some phenegran and take some of that with your opiates and it&#039;ll kill the nausea. But my suggestion is to do your opiate first then take the phenegran. Once you start puking your body is telling you that you&#039;ve got a lot of something in your system. If u plan on doing H again I reccomend doing your bumps get on that feel good level and take the phengrab. Its good to puke on H, it like that warning sign before OD&#039;ing.

No urge to try again, no problem with coke haves used like 4 times in my life and after trying heroin I would say no if some one offered it to me for free.

				34tuforlunch,<br /><br />That was in no way a slam against you.&nbsp; More like my experience.<br /><br />I was young, arrogant and ignorant.&nbsp; Above all, I thought I was different than others and could handle it.&nbsp; Once a month became once a week became....&nbsp; This isn&#039;t a lecture, my point is I didn&#039;t respect the drugs.&nbsp; I do now.

				34tuforlunch, what was your tolerance to opiates at the time you did the 100mg?<br /><br />The symptoms you are describing are those of a mild to moderate overdose.&nbsp; You have to be careful with things like H and other strong opiates, over a short term usage pattern they are cumulative.&nbsp; Unless you are used to doing 100mg of H or a similar opiate a day, you did too much.<br /><br />This is one of the more common ways people overdose on opiates.&nbsp; They chase the rush.&nbsp; They do a bit, get a nice high, then keep doing more until they pass out or in your case start feeling nauseous and then vomit.<br /><br />
