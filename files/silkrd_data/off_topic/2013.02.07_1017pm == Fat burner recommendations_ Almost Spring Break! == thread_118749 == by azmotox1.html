				Hey guys how&#039;s it going I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations or experience with any over the counter or fat burners found on SR. I am 5&#039;5&quot; 155 lbs with about 15% body fat. I weight lift and box and also do yoga. My diet it also in pretty good shape but I want something to help me melt the stomach fat by Spring break! Thanks!&nbsp; 8)

				Try cocaine or meth, either will have you loosing weight in no time. The pill diet works as well for those who like opiates! I&#039;ll link you a few supplements that will help also.

				I was about to toss out T3 as a suggestion as well. Not a bulking agent at all. I used to use the T3 spray you can get at most Test RC shops and you can feel it amp up your metabolism real time.

				Please don&#039;t go for the diet pill shit all that does is decrease your appetite which will hurt your metabolism if you aren&#039;t eating the right foods. The best rule I can give you is &quot;if the diet isn&#039;t something you can do forever, its a shitty diet&quot;<br /><br />The truth to weight loss is simple (but complicated to do).<br /><br />Calories in &lt; Calories out. Running and sweating is your best friends and ensuring that you don&#039;t reward yourself or over eat.<br /><br />To live a productive life you need to find a balance of vitamins and minerals that you take in without storing to much energy. I always recommend people to take multi vitamins everyday and fish oil. Also understand this:<br /><br />Fat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp; kcal/gram<br />Ethanol (drinking alcohol)&nbsp; &nbsp;7 kcal/gram<br />Proteins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 kcal/gram<br />Carbohydrates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp; kcal/gram<br />Polyols (sugar alcohols, sweeteners)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4<br />Fiber&nbsp; &nbsp;2 kcal/gram<br /><br />As you can see fiber and proteins are your best friends. carbohydrates are ok as well as long as you aren&#039;t consuming carbs that contain high amounts of sugars.&nbsp; If you monitor your caloric intake everyday while ensuring you get the right vitamins and minerals in your diet you WILL lose weight when combined with exercise. The only caution is to NOT starve yourself (like diet pills and meth do) because then you are signaling to your body that food is no longer abundant and we need to secrete more glycogen and store as much energy as we can. Then once you start going back to your normal eating habits you will maintain the state of energy conservation.

				The reason why the above is so good is because if you keep a healthy eating schedule and get to your goal weight exercise becomes less intense because all you are doing is maintaining the the weight you currently have as opposed to attempting to loose more.

				Totally agree, if you want to loose weight eat less do more.<br /><br />At the time I was taking the T3 though I was eating well and working out 6 days a week but I had a pretty good bit of weight to pull off so I used the T3 sparingly to drop a few extra pounds a little quicker.<br /><br />At least I didn&#039;t offer up the funnest way to loose weight, I hardly eat for days after a bit of MDMA, normally good for about 5 pounds off if I party.

				Low carb is very effective. There are a few dozen causes of hunger, but I&#039;m convinced that a major cause is the drop in blood sugar. You eat a meal, your blood sugar spikes, a few hours later it drops and you get hungry. If your blood sugar never spikes, then it can&#039;t crash and you don&#039;t get (as) hungry. I can consume 1000 - 1500 calories a day without getting hungry on a low carb diet and quickly lose weight. I&#039;ve found it to be very effective for short term weight loss, although hard to sustain for more than a few months.<br /><br />So if&nbsp; you need to lose 5 to 20 kilograms (10 to 50 pounds), try low carb. If you need to lose more, you will need a more sustainable long term option.

				diet should be mostly protein,&nbsp; some complex carbs, some natural (plants, nuts) fats, minimal everything else<br />working out isnt running your heart out as long as you can.&nbsp; if fat loss is your goal you should aim to get your heart pumping at around 65-75% of its capacity.&nbsp; google karvonens formula to determine your heart rate<br /><br />As far as supps, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) is both dangerous and effective.&nbsp; dangerous is first for a reason, dont overdue it and as with everything, be smart and use it effectively. will make you feel like you have a constant fever though
