				Thought this could be fun, everyone posts their favorite quote. <br /><br />I&#039;ll start:<br /><br />“Journalism is not a profession or a trade. It is a cheap catch-all for fuckoffs and misfits -- a false doorway to the backside of life, a filthy piss-ridden little hole nailed off by the building inspector, but just deep enough for a wino to curl up from the sidewalk and masturbate like a chimp in a zoo-cage.” <br />-Hunter S. Thompson<br /><br />I&#039;ve never read anything that was so fucking elegant AND obscene at the same time. The fact that he&#039;s got to be one of the greatest journalists ever makes it that much better. &lt;3 HST.<br /><br />What&#039;ve you got?

				Hey!<br />About the time I saw Fear and Loathing in las vegas, I never saw briefcases the same :) the world isn&#039;t the same once you have left it, ya know what I mean.<br /><br />For me... I saw the Marley film, and always was a fan, but just never knew. I have a simple one. <br /><br />&quot;Don&#039;t worry about a thing, because everything little thing is going to be alright&quot;<br /><br />I know its simple, but to me the most simple things in life are the ones that hold the most value. <br /><br />Good topic sir, blunt break ;)<br /><br />Oh or &quot;Daves not here man&quot; that one is winning too.

				You know, I&#039;ve never actually seen the movie - I can&#039;t count how many times I&#039;ve read the book, but I&#039;ve never gotten around to watching it. I have some lucy on the way, maybe I&#039;ll rent it for the night and eat some tabs ;)<br /><br />I love that one, so short and simple but its the fucking truth. <br /><br />Ahaha, I think I&#039;m going to join you and step out for a blunt too. ;D

				My other favorite:<br />&quot;We all have our little solipsistic delusions, ghastly intuitions of utter similarity: that we are the only one in the house who ever fills the ice-cube tray, who unloads the clean dishwasher, who occasionally pees in the shower, whose eyelid twitches on first dates; that only we take casualness terribly seriously; that only we hear the whiny pathos in a dog’s yawn, the timeless sigh in the opening of the hermetically-sealed jar, the splattered laugh in the frying egg, the minor-D lament in the vacuum’s scream; that only we feel the panic at sunset the rookie kindergartner feels at his mother’s retreat.

A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. He does not treat men as masters or slaves but as independent equals. He deals with men by means of a free, voluntary, unforced, uncoerced exchange-- an exchange which benefits both parties by means of their independent judgment.&quot;<br />Ayn Rand, The Virtue of Selfishness, &quot;The Objectivist Ethics&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Man thinks not only for the sake of thinking, but also in order to act.&quot;<br />Ludwig von Mises, Epistemological Problems of Economics<br /><br />

				I have two main favorites at the moment that stick out when I read this thread&#039;s title.<br /><br />&quot;What is the feeling when you&#039;re driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? it&#039;s the too-huge world vaulting us, and it&#039;s good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.&quot; - Jack Kerouac<br /><br />&quot;Between the banks of pain and pleasure the river of life flows. It is only when the mind refuses to flow with life, and gets stuck at the banks, that it becomes a problem. By flowing with life I mean acceptance-letting come what comes and go what goes. Desire not, fear not, observe the actual, as and when it happens, for you are not what happens, you are to whom it happens. You are the ultimate potentiality of which the all-embracing consciousness is the manifestation and expression.&quot; - Sri Nisaragadatta Maharaj<br /><br />

				Albert Einstein and Mark Twain have a plethora of great quotes:<br /><br />“Two things are infinite - the universe and human stupidity; and I&#039;m not sure about the universe.” - Albert Einstein<br /><br />“Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.” - Mark Twain<br /><br /><br />Although Eastbound &amp; Down is a gold mine of quotes:<br /><br />&quot;Fuck man, I&#039;m a bulletproof tiger, dude!&quot;<br /><br />Terrence Cutler: When I heard you were gonna be subbing here I almost lost my mind. <br />Kenny Powers: Well that&#039;s good for you. <br />Terrence Cutler: There&#039;s something you need to know, Kenny. You&#039;re not the only athlete here at Jeff Davis. I happen to be training for a Triathlon right now. Doin&#039; a lot of running, and cycling, swimming. Well you know all about that. <br />Kenny Powers: No actually I don&#039;t. I do SPORTS. Not try to be the best at exercising.<br /><br />News Reporter: So, Kenny. How do you feel about playing for New York? <br />Kenny Powers: You mean &#039;JEW&#039; York? It&#039;s fuckin&#039; great.<br /><br />Cassie Powers: Her name is Rose, named after Ms. Kate Winslet in the movie &#039;Titanic&#039;. <br />Kenny Powers: [laughs] Y&#039;all named your daughter after fucking &#039;Titanic&#039;? <br />Dustin Powers: Cassie&#039;s favorite movie. <br />Kenny Powers: [laughs] Wow, you gotta be shittin&#039; me. <br />[points to Dustin&#039;s son] <br />Kenny Powers: What&#039;s his name, fuckin&#039; Shrek?<br /><br />&quot;Undaunted, I knew the game was mine to win. Just like in life, all of my successes depend on me. I&#039;m the man who has the ball, I&#039;m the man who can throw it faster than fuck. So that is why I am better than everyone in the world. Kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone.&quot;<br /><br />Clegg: Powers. Step into my office. Let&#039;s do some blow. <br />Kenny Powers: Finally, motherfucker.<br /><br />&quot;Sure, I&#039;ve been called a xenophobe, but the truth is I&#039;m not. i honestly just feel that America is the best country and all the other countries aren&#039;t as good. That used to be called &#039;patriotism&#039;.&quot;<br /><br />P.E. Kid: When you did steroids, did they make your balls shrink? <br />Kenny Powers: Oh, you think that&#039;s funny? How &#039;bout I show you my balls right now and you can tell me if they shrunk, huh? No, for your information, I have full-size balls. Next question. <br />Girl P.E. Student #1: Is it true you were in jail? <br />Kenny Powers: No babe, rehab. <br />Girl P.E. Student #2: Did you hurt yourself? <br />Kenny Powers: No, I didn&#039;t hurt myself. <br />Girl P.E. Student #2: &#039;Cause Coach Booth said after his back surgery he has to go to rehab. <br />Kenny Powers: Oh okay. Yeah I hurt myself, I hurt my nose.<br />Timid P.E. Kid: My dad said you ruined baseball. <br />Kenny Powers: You know what? I can already tell that I don&#039;t like you. And I&#039;m probably not gonna like you no matter how many pull-ups or push-ups you do. All right, anybody who wants to pick on anybody in class, aim for him, &#039;cause I&#039;m not watchin&#039;.

The slogan &quot;press on&quot; has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race”<br /><br />Calvin Coolidge, bro<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I really love this one.<br /><br />&#039;&#039;The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.&#039;&#039; - Bill Murray<br /><br />&#039;&#039;Ninety percent of life is just showing up.&#039;&#039;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#039;s real because that&#039;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#039;s very brightly colored, and it&#039;s very loud, and it&#039;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#039;t worry; don&#039;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#039;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It&#039;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#039;t matter, because it&#039;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#039;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#039;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>- Bill Hicks<br /><br />I expected that to be posted already.

				&quot;I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?<br /><br />&quot;All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the overman: a laughingstock or a painful embarrassment.<br /><br />&nbsp;You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape.<br /><br />&nbsp; Behold, I teach you the overman! The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth! I beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth, and do not believe those who speak to you of otherworldly hopes! Poison-mixers are they, whether they know it or not. Despisers of life are they, decaying and poisoned themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so let them go!&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nietzsche Thus Spoke Zarathustra<br /><br />

				&quot;More weight!&quot; ~ Giles Corey<br /><br />The 80-year-old Corey was accused of witchcraft during the 1692 Salem trials, but he refused to enter a plea to the court. As punishment, he was laid naked in a pit in a field, and slowly pressed to death over two days. Heavy rocks were gradually placed upon his chest--but he refused to cry out in pain, or enter a plea, and each time he was asked to do so, he simply replied: &quot;More weight.&quot;<br /><br />Those were actually his lasts words as well, pretty bad-ass if you ask me&nbsp; 8)
