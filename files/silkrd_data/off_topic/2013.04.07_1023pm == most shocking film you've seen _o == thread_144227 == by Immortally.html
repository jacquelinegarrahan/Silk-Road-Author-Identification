				There was a movie with big names that came out last year that was supposed to be very raunchy.&nbsp; I heard about it on NPR and cannot figure out what it was!&nbsp; Happiness is a very disturbing movie!&nbsp; The opposite inverse of I Hearth Huckabees which I watch on once in a great while if I&#039;m depressed and never fails to immediately get me feeling good.&nbsp; <br /><br />Watch Williams Burroughs Cut ups!

				Probs not the MOST shocking ever but one thats still an interesting film is called The Divide. Why i mention it though is because it goes from being a somewhat normal post apocalyptic film to this deep, dark, disturbing, psychological, horror fest. Cannibal Island would probs be pretty high up there.

				A Serbian Film, definitely, even though it gets counterproductive at some point because of its over-the-top-ness. <br /><br />I&#039;m missing one extra ball to have the nerve to watch &quot;The Human Centipede 2&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				A Serbian Film, has got to be up there most definitely for proper production film. <br /><br />Been exposed to snuff/ genital torture videos and shit like faces of death which were pretty vile, and definitely not searched out by myself, rest assured!!<br /><br />To me though, the concept is the most shocking part. We know this shit goes on, but to see it presented like A Serbian Film.... That artistic element makes me cringe that little bit more than seeing the real footage. <br /><br />Brainwashed by Hollywood? Probably...

				A movie I think called rewind it starts with a bad rape scene, a really fucked way to begin a movie, especially when you have been fried for a couple of days and randomly choose it from the store.<br />Most of these movies aren&#039;t that bad the first faces of death was all fake stuff.<br />This is a good post I love my B grade horror and always looking for new stuff for a laugh.

One of the images actually turned me on. I would like to do that in real life. But, it wasn&#039;t one of the gross scenes. I loved it.

				I couldn&#039;t sit through Serbian Film, made it probably about halfway but it was too much and I wasn&#039;t entertained by it personally.&nbsp; It felt like it was just shock for the sake of shock, not enough plot.&nbsp; Some other shocking films I&#039;ve seen that come to mind are Salo (1975), Men Behind the Sun and Visitor Q.&nbsp; The lactating/adult breast feeding heroin addict scene in Visitor Q is definitely one of the most fucked up things I&#039;ve seen to date.

Please tell us a little about yourself, how old you are, where you live, what you do, what you like to do, etc.<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I am 40 year old, my birthday is on March 13th. I live in Russia or more precisely in Ukraine and work as a manager. I like soccer, books and computer games (usually strategies or rally).<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: You got famous all over the world thanks to 1guy1cup video, even though most people don’t know who it is in the video. Does it make you happy you became such an internet celebrity?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I’ll be honest with you, I truly enjoy this reputation. This is cool!<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Did popularity of your video surprise you?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: Yes, I did not expect this popularity; It was a real surprise for me.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Looking back at popularity of 1guy1cup, have you ever come to regret leaking the video on the net?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No, thus far not at all.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Would you do it again if you had accidentally filmed another “shocking” video?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: Yes, I will be doing it again, but without broken glass in my ass this time; I have been filming myself for a long time and have countless videos, many of them can be found on the internet, however none of them is as splendid as 1guy1cup. I hope you enjoyed some of my favorites I had sent to you, Mark.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Yes, I’ve checked them all out. Thanks for hooking me up with hours of extreme adult entertainment, Alex. I must admit, you are far crazier than I would have thought. 1Guy1Cup was an accident, but even other, no accident videos are beyond insane, and I’ve seen some shit in my life. Anyway, how did Guy1Cup make it on the internet? Did you upload it yourself? What prompted you to do it? How long after the actual incident (curious as to how long you were deciding whether to share it or not)?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I did upload the video myself. I have been meaning to make my videos publically available for a while. 1Guy1Cup was filmed on August 21, 2007, but I haven’t published it until December 1, 2008. As you can see, more than 15 months passed between filming of 1Guy1Cup and actual upload on the internet. Most of this delay was caused by me being very busy as of late and also not knowing how to upload videos on the internet. However, I knew right after the incident that I will share this video for sure as I had believed a video like that would be very interesting for people.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Most men are extremely sensitive about foreign objects entering their anus. What made you like it? How would you describe the sensation?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I decided to stretch my anus to the max many years ago. I wanted to be able to fist my own ass, which I eventually managed. The ability to stick your own fist up your rectum definitely offers a variety of sensations that you can’t experience otherwise. I must admit that the beginning were rather tough. Until your anal opening is stretched well enough, trying to force large objects through there induces vomiting. As you continue doing it, you eventually get used to it and don’t throw up anymore. Then it’s pure pleasure.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: How old were you when you started inserting object in your anus? Do you remember your first time ever? How was it? What prompted you to do it?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I started inserting objects in my anus when I was 27 – so about 12 years ago. Curiosity and the thirst for new sensations prompted me to do it. I don’t remember my first time. But I remember I had used 0.25l bottle of coke for a long time. I did it in the bath.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: As for the 1guy1cup accident itself – how long did it take you to remove all shards of broken glass out of your anus?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: It wasn’t until the following day that I had most of the broken glass out of my ass. Still, one or two very small broken glass pieces are still in there. I can still feel them with my fingers but I can’t get them out anymore. Btw after publically available part of 1Guy1Cup video ended, I still had at least one half of the broken glass inside my ass. I went to the bathroom to pick it all up and that’s where I got the biggest piece – it had a capital letter L shape. Oh, and I wasn’t me who screams “noooo” at the end of the video. This was the editor from efukt.com who added it there.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Did you go to see a doctor about it?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No. I did not want anyone to question me about it.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: You lost lots of blood when that jar glass exploded in your anus, wasn’t it concerning you?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: Yes, I almost fell unconscious due to blood loss. I could barely make it to the bed. Btw the incident was in the drawing-room of an apartment I had leased at the time, not in the kitchen. As former blood donor, I was able to put up with this type of blood loss and recover quite easily.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: One question that absolutely everyone who’s seen 1Guy1Cup is asking – you have not made a simple peep when the glass shattered in your anus, how could you react to it so calmly and not ever curse one single time?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I did curse, but only in my mind.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: How long did it take for the area to fully heal?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I don’t remember, about two weeks.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Did you have to take any special precautions to avoid bleeding in public, such as plugging your anus with cotton to soak up leaking blood?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: Yes, I used cotton.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Were you having troubles shitting after the incident?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No, no trouble shitting whatsoever.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Did you have to adjust your diet in order to minimize bowel movement (aka minimize occurrences of having to use bathroom)?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No, I continued eating as usual.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Many people who saw the video speculated that you may have actually liked the fact that the glass shattered and cut you within. Was it really the case?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: It was really an accident. It was unintended and gave me no pleasure.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: The speculations say that you purposefully chose to sit on a glass object, rather than plastic to maximize the chances of an accident. Was your thinking something like that? Did it turn you on knowing that the glass could break and you could get into serious trouble?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No, I have been inserting glass objects in my anus for years and never had any accident. I generally consider glass jars safe for insertions. However, I usually fill the jars up with water. In my opinion, water filled jars are less likely to break. This one time I have neglected this part and the results are what you had seen in the video. I applied pressure to the lid under an angle and neck of the jar cracked. Plastic bottle aren’t as much fun as glass jars. Glass jars are not as easy to insert and unlike plastic, the diameter of gass jars doesn’t change.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Was it painful? Getting cut inside must have caused a lot of pain. Describe the pain you went through.<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: It was extremely painful. A truly horrific experience.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Has 1guy1cup accident made you limit insertions of glass object up your anus, or has it encouraged you?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I continued to insert glass objects up my anus as normal. I no longer worry about accidents.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: How long have you waited after the accident to insert an object in your anus again? Did you miss it?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: I’d waited for two months and resumed with small plastic bottle.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: Has it ever occurred to you during the 1guy1cup incident that this would be it, that you’re done inserting stuff in your anus?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: No it hasn’t of course. This was the first time and I hope it won’t happen again.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: What was the biggest object to date you have inserted up your anus?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: The biggest object used to me a glass jar that was 3,43 in (87,1 mm) in diameter. I haven’t exceeded myself until very recently and now I can insert a jar that’s 87,7 mm around.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: You have filmed yourself on the video – who was the video intended for? Have you ever considered a career in porn?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: The video was intended for my personal home archive. I thought about career in porn when I was young but this was rather impossible in former Soviet Union.<br /><br />Mark for Best Gore: When is the next video from 1guy1cup star coming to the net?<br />Alex aka 1Guy1Cup: You can see some of my other videos on sexrazor.com and on owmyass.com but they aren’t famous. Videos titles “Finger 02” and “Tool 02” have not been seen by anyone but you, Mark. You are the only person I have forwarded them to.<br /><br />Thanks a lot Alex for this awesome interview. It definitely clears up speculations and sets the record straight. Speaking of “straight” – for those who are wandering, Alex is not gay. He’s a straight man and has a wife and two sons. The videos he’s shared with me that nobody else has seen are every bit as crazy as 1guy1cup. Perhaps I can get Alex to agree to share those videos with you too. In the meantime, below is the shout out from this awesome dude to all the awesome peeps who read the shit on Best Gore.<br /><br />If you have questions you would like to ask Alex, fire away in the comments. Alex is also a regular on Best Gore and will be most happy to answer it for you. To sum the interview up, I will post a quote from Alex that will make you go WTF just as much as 1guy1cup video:<br /><br />“Let me tell you something about my baby ant-eater – his form can only astonish those, who see nothing besides their own penis.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.bestgore.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/alex-1guy1cup-interview-500x281.jpg

				Hmmm so lets all talk about what we have shoved up our asses :o. He would be an awesome drug mule, it would be like filling the overhead compartment on the plane, he would have to be able to fit a couple of kilo up there as long as it wasn&#039;t too loose that it just fell out.

				why the hate for i spit on your grave?? i don&#039;t remember it being that bad at all... it&#039;s a heartwarming tale of vigilante justice! tbf i still get freaked out by the girl coming down the stairs all creepy in the exorcist like they rip on the opening credits of american horror story s2. probably shouldn&#039;t have watched it before my age reached double digits and i was still reading enid blyton like the coolest kid ever. pretty much anything with an anonweirdo in a mask freaks me out. good thing no one bothers with halloween here.
