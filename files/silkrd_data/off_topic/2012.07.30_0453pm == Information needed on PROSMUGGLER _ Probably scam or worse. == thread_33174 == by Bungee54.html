				I gotta think that it is LE - they&#039;re fishing for an address/location to send you an illegal substance.... Doing this unsolicited, unencrypted.... just dumb.&nbsp; I have to think that perhaps this is just a scam though - LE would probably encrypt... right?&nbsp; I&#039;m probably giving them too much credit there...

				Le isn&#039;t as stupid to not encrypt their shit when we all bitch about vendors and customers not encrypting on the forums, they would try to blend in as best as possible. I think the person just has no idea wtf they&#039;re doing.
