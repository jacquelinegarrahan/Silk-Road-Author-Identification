				My thoughts are this.<br /><br />People need to grow some nuts and stop making ghost accounts.<br /><br />It&#039;s annoying to see 30 threads started by trolls. <br /><br />This one annoys me too, but it actually serves a purpose.

				The worst part is they aren&#039;t spreading fear.&nbsp; The only thing they are spreading is frustration and anger.<br /><br />My guess is we are probably dealing with a few pimply faced teenage wankers who are frustrated themselves because the closest they will ever come to having sex with a woman is by purchasing an inflatable latex doll with &#039;almost lifelike&#039; action.<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn&#039;t leave out the scammer&#039;s, buyers or sellers, trying desperately to get someone to believe them so they can possibly make a few BTC.<br /><br />Until they come up with a better way of controlling the ability of users to create new member accounts on the forums there isn&#039;t much we can do about it other than to ignore the idiots and call out the scammers.<br /><br />It really is frustrating when somebody with 2 posts to their name creates 10 new threads with the same title &#039;Because they want to make sure someone reads it&#039;.&nbsp; Or the various douche bags who think they are so smart, setting up new accounts with some variation of the name &#039;LEO&#039;, telling us that SR is going down.<br /><br />Maybe they should add a feature that if a members negative karma reaches 50 or 100 that their account automatically loses posting privileges for a least one day and is flagged for a mods attention.<br /><br />If the number was high enough I don&#039;t believe they could do the same to us, since I doubt they could find 2 friends to help them, let alone 100.&nbsp; And make it so nobody with less than 50-75 posts can click on karma.<br /><br />Just an idea I&#039;m throwing out there. I&#039;m sure lots of members will point out all the deficiency&#039;s of my plan, but that&#039;s OK, that&#039;s what these forums are supposed to be for.&nbsp; Members engaged in reasonable discussion, trying to help out where possible.<br /><br />It&#039;s not supposed to be a place for every Moe, Larry and Curly to post their own personal conspiracy theory.<br /><br />Time to stop before I become guilty of the same thing, wasting peoples time with <br /><br />

				Solution: New account cannot create threads... only respond inside them until an appropriate amount of time has passed.&nbsp; Post counts can be artificially increased easily and are not a good indicator of forum-user validity.

				Perhaps restrict certain posting privileges. One thread per day until you hit 30 days, or something.<br /><br />Or give the community more moderation powers. While we have 5(?) members who have administrative powers like banning people, find a group of like 10 active posters and give them the power to delete posts and threads, or &quot;silence&quot; users for up to a day. The former to get rid of the shit and the latter to quiet the potential rage posts that follow.

				I saw a picture today that said<br /><br />War On Terror<br /><br />&quot;On&quot; was crossed out with a big red X and underneath someone had written in &quot;Is&quot;<br /><br />Was really eye opening for me and maybe it doesn&#039;t apply to SR or this thread directly but still a pretty profound thought imo.&nbsp; ;)

				Call me paranoid (and I&#039;ve said this in a previous rant before) but &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot; is a classic and very successful Pys-Op strategy. I can have no doubt whatsoever that LE have or are using sock-puppet accounts with the intention to divide, disrupt, and make inroads into the Silk Road community.<br /><br />Thing is: while I disagree with LEO at least I can understand&nbsp; their fucked up motivations (ideology/paying the rent/small penis) which is far more than I can say re: the sudden influx trolls&nbsp; who I suspect are having a rather difficult time trying to get laid (?). Honestly..they are truly more annoying than pop-up ads or that &quot;Who let the dogs out?&quot; song a few years back.<br /><br />Seriously: you wanna troll? Go to Youtube and get into some epic name calling with a stranger on the other side of the planet who thinks Lady Gaga is better than Madonna.<br /><br />Recognize the sanctity of what we are doing here, and show some fokken respect.Drug fiends have it hard enough as it is: let us buy our Coke/H/Acid/DMT/Bud in peace and spare us all this DeGrassi High bull-shit.<br /><br />Fuck... another all nighter.I better get to sleep before I die. :)<br /><br />**SILKROAD: Membership has it&#039;s privileges**

				In my opinion I think its a little odd to assume all the trolls are more likely to be LEO than just annoying ass people taht get kicks out of stirring shit up. Cops aren&#039;t amazingly moral people that just want this site to go away, they want to bring it down and take names. They aren&#039;t fucking with us because they think its for our own good. They&#039;re gonna more likely act like us and try to get our information then take us out.<br /><br />War on drugs is bullshit really.<br /><br />So yea I agree its inundation of cunts as limetless said.
