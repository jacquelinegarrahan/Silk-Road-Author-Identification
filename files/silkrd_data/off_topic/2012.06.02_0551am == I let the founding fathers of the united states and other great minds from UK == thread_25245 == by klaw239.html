				Speak for what I personally believe that SR is fighting for. At least in principle aside from wanting profits but that is the nature of all business so no harm.<br /><br />&nbsp;If people let government decide what foods they eat <br />and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a <br />state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny. - Thomas Jefferson : - - - -Now&nbsp; Today&#039;s&nbsp; corrupt Gov view --The voters in this country<br />should not be expected to decide<br />which medicines are safe and effective.<br />-- Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey......Who not only is the criminal but who is immoral and against the will of god?<br /><br />&quot;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every <br />form of tyranny over the mind of man.&quot; — Thomas Jefferson<br /><br /><br />“Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution the time will come <br />when medicine will organize itself into an undercover dictatorship. To <br />restrict the art of healing to doctors and deny equal privileges to <br />others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws <br />are un-American and despotic.”<br />― Benjamin Rush 1878<br /><br />Make the most of the Indian Hemp Seed and sow it everywhere. -- George Washington <br /><br />Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property.<br />Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another.<br />Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property.<br />March 1, 1875.<br /><br />The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by <br />the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the <br />government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be <br />enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in <br />this country is closely connected with this.- Albert Einstein <br /><br /><br />A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our <br />government was founded Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to <br />control a man&#039;s appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out of <br />things that are not crimes..-Abraham Lincoln, <br /><br />When governments fear the people there is liberty. When the people fear <br />the government there is tyranny. -- Thomas Jefferson <br /><br />“Don&#039;t interfere with anything in the Constitution. That must be <br />maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our liberties.”<br />― Abraham Lincoln<br /><br />“We the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the&nbsp; courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who <br />pervert the Constitution.”<br />― Abraham Lincoln<br /><br />Tenth Amendment, essentially. And the amendment itself is simple as well as straightforward:<br />The People and any lawful inhabitant, resident, or sojourner of the state of (Your state) shall have freedom of choice and practice of any health or medical care modalities as they deem in their own personal best interest and judgment.-1890<br /><br />“I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but <br />the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to <br />exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not <br />to take it from them but to inform their discretion by education. This <br />is the true corrective of abuses of Constitutional power.”<br />― Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />Of all serious crimes under the law, smuggling... least violates the <br />consciences of men. It is a crime against law and against government, <br />but not against morality. The smuggler robs no man. He buys goods <br />honestly in one market and sells them honestly in another. His offense <br />is against an arbitrary regulation of government.... he simply fails to <br />pay its demands. Many men otherwise honest are unable to see any moral <br />turpitude in smuggling. ...government, in exacting toll, plays the part <br />of the highwayman. -- &quot;The Kaasan Bay &#039;Find,&#039;&quot; editorial, The <br />Oregonian, Jan. 21, 1886<br /><br />&quot;Any fool can create a law destined to fail but every fool will uphold a failed law&quot;&nbsp; LEO start doing the right thing and stop doing the robotic thing of doing what the corrupt Government has brainwashed you to.. Be a human not a Robocop.<br /><br />&nbsp;I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery. -- Thomas Jefferson <br />(1743-1826) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Nice post. +1<br /><br />Some of the greatest minds in history said it best, and most knew over 100 years ago. When will the time come when we can finally breathe a sigh of relief, and not have to worry about being thrown in a cage for harming no one, and enjoying some recreational drug use?<br /><br />Ive been thinking about this a lot lately and the only thing i can come up with that even makes any sense is the few retards who cant handle their shit ruin it for the rest of us. It just sucks that we all have to be classified as criminals even if we are responsible in our choice to use drugs. I hurt no one in my drug use. I never would. The most irresponsible thing ive done while intoxicated was drive, and that was on alcohol which is legal. WTF is wrong with this picture?

				The &quot;ruin it for the rest of us&quot; argument has a few very limited, legitimate applications, all of them pertaining to the &quot;retards&quot; causing an individual to withdraw services being granted or sold due to the actions of said retards. <br />This would be the case where someone graciously allows kids to play on his lot but then some of them start tearing up the place, or one breaks his leg and some lawyer convinces him that it it somehow the fault of the owner of the property he chose to play on.<br /><br />Never can the actions of any number of retards bring tyranny to us an any way but one.....by voting.<br />And only then by accepting the outcome as a legitimate thing, that because some number of people agreed to take some of your property, tell you how you may bot use the rest of it, and tell you what you can buy, sell, consume or who you must go kill when they say....that somehow that group being in agreement just overrode the natural rights of every human NOT in agreement.<br /><br />The retards that ruin it for us are the ones who try to, and somehow succeed, in voting their opinions of &quot;correct&quot; pre-emptive measures to REAL crime, which would be harming property or person, into existence, and of course the retards who go along with it, even when they don&#039;t agree at the moment.....so they can have THEIR turn in a few years.<br />Then THEY will decide what to restrict, how many people to hire to enforce and administer the restricting, and how much to steal from which groups through taxation, bad borrowing and counterfeiting to appear to be paying for it all.<br />This all with only a bare minimum of real crimes occurring that so much effort must &quot;prevent&quot;, that is until the prevention creates more crimes. And as this all happens the victim, the only one whom just law is for and any compensation is due is nothing but the cash cow of the gang (pretending to be 2 gangs) of retards.<br /><br />

				+1. I love reading fucking badass quotes. Gets me all riled up.<br /><br />The founding fathers understood though. Freedom isn&#039;t fucking driving a car and buying bread from the supermarket and watching shit on TV. Sure, we&#039;re free to do that, but that isn&#039;t what freedom is. <br /><br />Braveheart is one of the most incredible films when it comes to the concept of freedom. That coupled with the incredible score. That film destroyed me the first time I saw it.
