Steam product keys specifically I couldn&#039;t tell you, I don&#039;t know much about them as the only steam games I play are Football Manager and Counter Strike, but I&#039;d imagine generated keys would be banned pretty easily.

				How the fuck did you manage to get Tor set up (or even find out about it) but don&#039;t know where to get cracked PC games? I knew where and how to get those by the time I was like 13.

				Vinnyg007, you&#039;re able to reverse safedisc and steam? Or &quot;cracking&quot; is just copy some given files from a dir to another?<br /><br />If you want to buy some steam games with bitcoin, you should have a look at https://www.steamcoin.com/ :)

				Well you have bitcoins and then you have buttcoins. But if you looking for a torrent site. Then try Torrentday for your warez need. You may find live fights on tor . Not MMA but ppl fighting animals.<br />How long have you been on the dark nett if you haven&#039;t found torrentday yet? For all your 0 day needs you find them there. Its a private tracker btw so you don&#039;t need to be worried . pm for an invite.

				download the program uTorrent.<br /><br />then check out demonoid.me, isohunt.org, and torrentreactor.net<br /><br />.torrent files can be loaded in uTorrent. uTorrent does the downloading. don&#039;t torrify uTorrent.<br /><br />all of this should be done on the clearnet.

				Don&#039;t torrify uTorrent ?<br /><br />If i would use any kind of p2p software, i&#039;ll always torrify it, speed not needed, but security. Otherwise you have high chances to get a &quot;love letter&quot;, as long you&#039;re downloading from public sources.<br />Ofc there are many torrent users which are lucky and won&#039;t get any letter by the LE, while downloading for years, but i won&#039;t like to gamble with my money/freedom for some games (or any files else) ;)

Aside from the horrible speeds and security risks involved, the Tor nodes are run by people not server farms so you&#039;re essentially putting an unneeded strain on the Tor network itself.<br /><br />For the security reasons as to why you shouldn&#039;t do it, can just google it or view an article about it here: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea<br /><br />

				Didn&#039;t know that, i&#039;m not with torrents, i totally agree to you, that a vpn or socks is the better solution to anonymize p2p traffic.<br />Thanks for the info (:
