				So okay im baked but I just thought of something. What if you took a really small amount of all your favorite drugs. Imagine this: 100ug of lsd and 1 hit of mdma mixed in opium poppy/coca leaf/salvia leaf tea, (&quot;candy flip happy time tea&quot;) with 1 bar of xanax taken gradually, complimented by a nice changa herb smoke slathered in blue dream budder that has ketamine dissolved in it. So basically you just drink a cup of tea and smoke an herbal cigar... and then you&#039;d just be like woah completely baked...

				The best high is an acid high, the moment you ponder a memory of your childhood and distinctly remember being acid high at the time that memory was made, and at the time every other memory was made, because that magnificent high is just how your brain has always worked. So clear, so functional, so happy and colorful and creative and quick, feels like you&#039;re just saturated with psychedelic energy instead of &quot;on a drug,&quot; and my goodness when the first thing you think is &quot;Oh my, this is how I&#039;m supposed to think,&quot; as though eating that 6 hits was like eating food for the first time in ages, when you were on the brink of starvation...<br /><br />Yeah, that&#039;s my favorite high.
