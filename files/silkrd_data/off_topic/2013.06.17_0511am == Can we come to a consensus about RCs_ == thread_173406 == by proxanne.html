				What do you think about RCs?&nbsp; Have you tried any?<br /><br />In a hypothetical situation, would there be a RC you would favor over an illicit drug?<br /><br />If you had to pick one, which RC would you favor the most? (feel free to answer that for different categories [e.g. opiods, tryptimines, cannabinoids])<br /><br />Do you feel SR is a good place to market RCs? (vendors&#039; opinions welcome)<br /><br />And any other point you would like to make regarding the topic.

				I have done more than 30.&nbsp; I like many of them more than some &quot;common drugs.&quot;&nbsp; It depends on the common drug and the RC.

				JWH-018 has been my favorite cannabinoid.&nbsp; The good pure stuff.&nbsp; Not in powder form.&nbsp; High potency powder is decent too though.&nbsp; MDPV is too strong for my taste.&nbsp; I&#039;m more of a hallucinogen type of guy.&nbsp; 4-FA is not like meth lol.&nbsp; MDPV can keep you up for a long time but it&#039;s not the same as meth either.&nbsp; It&#039;s insanely stronger than 4-FA.&nbsp; I loved 2C-e.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done that over a hundred times.

				Yeah, I tried it thinking I would get the same kick... hell no!&nbsp; But I did get a decent rush off the stuff.&nbsp; I&#039;m interested in trying Shulgin&#039;s stuff... and other tryptamines<br />The RC market seems more promising for psychedelics than anything else... but from what I gather, they usually don&#039;t make the cut when compared to similar, tried and true (albeit illegal) drugs.<br /><br />I&#039;m also gauging how much the SR is a viable market place for these up-and-coming chemicals.&nbsp; I&#039;ve looked at a few rc vendors and they all seem to be doing well, with plenty of transactions for all the competition.

				What Jack says - depends on the RC. You wouldn&#039;t treat them as a homogenous group anymore than you&#039;d listen to someone talk about &quot;drugs&quot;.<br /><br />Myself, I&#039;ve tried the 25c NBOME a few times and decided it wasn&#039;t for me.<br /><br />On the other hand, I&#039;ve had 4-aco-DMT (Erowid still calls this a RC but it has some history at this point) and I love it.<br /><br />So, it depends.

				Ahh research chemicals-FUCKIN GROSS!&nbsp; Ive had 25i and 25c and they were terrible.&nbsp; Ive been into drugs for about 10 years now and i havent always done what you would consider &quot;conventional&quot; drugs.&nbsp; Ive huffed gas and keyboard cleaner, as well as getting fucked up on Coriciden and Dramamine.&nbsp; Also a ton of the drugs you actually pay money for(instead of steal), and there was one time i hit way too much gas, and that time on the Dram. but other than that i always enjoyed the way i felt; didnt want it to end.&nbsp; On those goddamn RC&#039;s though i just kept thinking like damn i wish i woulda just smoked bud and went to bed. I could not wait until it was over, no more RC&#039;s for me, good drugs only please!

				Sells better- is it cheaper?&nbsp; I probably dont need to be on this thread because i fucking hate RC&#039;s, but i do know folks who like them.&nbsp; Morons if you ask me, but you didn&#039;t.&nbsp; Going back to my hate of RCs, you know why they&#039;re legal?&nbsp; Because the gov. is okay with people taking shit drugs just not the good ones.&nbsp; Before i get a bunch of responses let me say i know that&#039;s not the real reason, i was making a joke.

				In my humble opinion the term &quot;research chemicals&quot; should not be used and here&#039;s why:<br />It actually refers to chemicals that have originally been designed for actual research like the NBOMes and technically even LSD but since such chemicals have become available online as replacements for illegals drugs, many people use the term to refer to chemicals with a short history of human use but that&#039;s not correct. Most people think 2Cs are research chemicals which is not true because they were purposefully designed as psychedelics and not for conventional research.
