				Currently I&#039;m keeping my collection inside the house but as it&#039;s becoming head uncomfortable I&#039;d like to move them to somewhere outside. I don&#039;t want to be a burden to my friends, etc. and am looking for some alternative ways of storing them outside. It&#039;s a personal collection - small quantities of sometimes very delicate substances (LSD). My question is where would you hide it? What container etc. would you use? Please give me some ideas ... thanks!

				Personally I&#039;d put it in a bag, wrapped in a towel or old shirt and tuck that into an airtight container (preferably something with a screw on top) and bury that underneath something or the shelves of the shed/garage or something along those lines. <br /><br />I usually keep mine in a container of mints tucked into the curtain rod hole.

				Get one of those outdoor rock stashes.&nbsp; You can find it on eBay as well as stash cans that are made out shaving cream, soda cans, even lint rollers.

				Some local kids are often hiding knives and their shots of crack and heroin in ribena drink cartons and throwing them in bushes on my street when they go home, its somewhat safe as long as nobody sees you doing this. I would reccomend airtight, close to home if you need it to be and very discreet. I use a money box that taxi drivers use and hide it in a sandbag in the back of my garden.. Its preference really its normally safe to leave it in your house as long as your sure that no one will come in looking for it or its well hidden..

				Just get a waterproof lockbox or something, put your stuff in and throw it in a creek/pond near your house.<br />If you store enough stuff of value in it, it might even be worthwhile to get a GPS chip for it in case anyone steals it.<br />I would only use this if you have a lot of stuff and it&#039;s worth it, but that&#039;s the best way I can think of.<br />If it&#039;s like a 20 minute walk from your house, no one can connect it to you (just be careful of fingerprints), and you can build up your stash there and always keep below a certain amount in your house, and clean house in 20 minutes if necessary.<br />Good luck

				SWIM&#039;s Uncle&#039;s Pet Unicorn told me his Puppy psychically messaged him and told him that his great Grandfather used to store his drugs under a step in the back garden, they&#039;re great for getting up easily, especially ones that stick out a little as you can get granite blocks as steps that are FAR too heavy for even 2 people to use, and use a car jack to lift them up.<br /><br />(The SWIM statement was a dig at how much it&#039;s popped up recently, not me being serious)<br /><br />Also a note, whatever you store them in outside, make sure to include a lot of rice, or if you can get it, silica gel, this will absorb any moisture that gets in.<br /><br />Also, if you have an attic and a good neighbour, it&#039;s a good idea to take a few bricks out in an inconspicious place so you can easily access the drugs, but they are not on your property.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how it works with warrants, but I&#039;m sure if they suspect the drugs are in a different address they will need a fresh warrant, which gives you time to have them destroyed, don&#039;t quote me on this though!<br /><br />Oh also, as a sidenote, you should try to keep 2 stashes. One that has a decent portion of cash and drugs, and a second main stash, as most times if you&#039;re raided and they find it, and that&#039;s what you&#039;re suspected of, they&#039;re not gonna carry on searching.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a really nice setup where a guy had solid wooden flooring that could come up and had a safe in the floor, where he kept loads of cash, scales, baggies, and some drugs...then he kept a second stash with his main supply and a third stash where he kept his money (if they come in with sniffer dogs you&#039;re fucked, so best to keep money separate).<br /><br />But these are only recommended if outside storage isn&#039;t a possibility. If you&#039;re planning on using stash houses be very careful, several years ago I got SEVERELY burnt by a stash raid...a guy I used was partying really hard on my gear and got raided, but the only thing he had on me was my initial and a phone number for a burner...but he had the information for my other stash houses, so gave them up. Ended up losing several kilos of various drugs and well over Â£100,000.

				If you have chainlink fence around your property you can always take the cap off one of the posts and put whatever you want in there.
