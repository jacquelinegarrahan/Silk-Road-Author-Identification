				Look for drugs on SR with the highest profit margin when resold IRL. MDMA very suitable for that.

If you buy 5 grams it&#039;s about $30 / gram. Buy 10+ g rams and it gets down to $20 / gram.<br />In Australia 1gm MDMA is about $250. So there is massive money to be made if you import it and sell it. Just gotta plan well and be careful.

				You could donate plasma.&nbsp; At a local clinic, I can get $90/week donating only twice a week (max allowed)<br /><br />Obviously wont work if you are an IV drug user or have a blood disease.&nbsp; But if you&#039;re all clean its a sure fire way to make money.

				If there was an easy way to make a lot of money, everyone would jump in and do it, thus raising the competition level to where you&#039;d have to work hard to make money.<br /><br />That&#039;s why there are no easy ways to make a lot of money.<br />
