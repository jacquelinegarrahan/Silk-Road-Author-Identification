				Aside from weed, you&#039;re not taking any drugs that are &quot;addicting&quot;. I smoke it every day too because it just makes life better, some people would call that an addiction though. You just sound like a Pyschonaut who just plain enjoys tripping as much as he can. Nothing you&#039;ve listed that you take is addicting itself, it&#039;s not my place to say if you&#039;re doing it too much, but if your spouse says you trip too often there might be some truth to it. You could quit taking all that stuff tomorrow and not get sick, so you&#039;re not an addict in any sense of the word. Likely your wife is just concerned or thinks you&#039;re spending too much money on here.

				Anyone who calls a psychonaut a druggie, just needs to relax, learn to breathe and see all the greatness tripping can do for them. Worked for me.

				I would rather spend $6 on a tab of acid and &#039;trip&#039; for twelve hours than spend $12 on a movie ticket and sit on my ass for two, but that&#039;s just me. I think personal growth means more than personal possessions, especially knowing those possessions would mean nothing if I learned I were to die tomorrow. Consider you&#039;re wife&#039;s opinion but realize that it&#039;s exactly that, her opinion, in the end it&#039;s your life and it&#039;s those who wish to be apart of it should learn to accept you and your decisions because you&#039;re an adult and you deserve that right. On the other side of the spectrum don&#039;t get caught up in fantasy when the real world needs you, be responsible. :)

				I do a lot of drugs people consider &#039;druggie&#039; worthy, not meth or heroin or anything but I definitely can find respect if you can use them and not feel bound to them.<br /><br />To me, being a druggie is losing control of the drug you&#039;re doing ; when you start doing drugs without even wanting to do them, but you&#039;re bound by an unworldly force to do those drugs. When you find yourself doing a drug and being like &quot;why the fuck did I even do this?&quot;<br /><br />I realize that most people experience that a few times in their drug-using career, but I find that a good way for me to know when to calm myself down when I do a lot of drugs. Substance abuse runs in my family and if I don&#039;t keep a close eye on my drug use I know I am going to wind up dead choked on my own vomit one night. So when I do have those thoughts where I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m doing something, I stop doing drugs entirely ( aside from cigarettes and caffeine, &#039;cause I know I&#039;m legitimately physically addicted to those ) for at least a month or so. Usually after the first week I don&#039;t even have the compulsion to go out and get them anymore. When they come around, I indulge, though.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had any bad experiences with drugs aside from a couple. I had a complexed blotter and my blood sugar spiked on one occasion. The other bad experience I had was when I had been binging on methylone and wound up talking to shadow people. That&#039;s when I started doing my cool off thing.<br /><br /><br />Needless to say, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re a druggie unless you let drugs control you as opposed to help you expand your consciousness. I have a great respect for wizened psychonauts, so good luck on your journey. :P

				Going to sound very &quot;un-cool&quot; of me but whatever!<br /><br />Doing too much of ANYTHING is bad, I was VERY much a psychedelic enthusiast, coupled with the fact that being a seller meant unlimited use...<br /><br />I can attest to the fact that yes while tripping is very insightful, and often times emotional... In the end if you do too much of a psychedelic substance (even MJ ) you can lose touch with the fact that it is called &quot;tripping&quot; for a reason... So these happy rainbow thoughts and radical dissent for paper money, the government, etc.. In the end, you come down and have to deal with integrating with a normal society whether you like it or not.<br /><br />Eventually &quot;tripping&quot; seems normal, even routine, and that&#039;s the very reason why I myself am no longer into the &quot;tripping balls&quot; phase of my life... It lost it&#039;s magic, and became too &quot;real&quot; when the intent was to escape &quot;real&quot; in the first place.<br /><br />Having said all of that, that is simply MY experience with psychedelic use... and I am no means a lightweight... I&#039;ve got several hundred trips under my belt. Trust me.<br /><br />Have fun &amp; do what makes you happy,<br /><br />The Chubster

				Chubs, what you are saying comes very close to my truth and believes. +1<br /><br />OP, maybe you can find out why your wife thinks that, if she maybe feels she is missing out on who you are. <br />Or even try to go without drugs for a month and look at it from an other perspective. It will give you some distance and clarity too. If you can&#039;t go without drugs or don&#039;t want to, this tells you a lot too.

				What&#039;s the definition of a druggie? Someone who puts getting high over everything else? Someone who uses daily? Someone who is addicted? My point is, everyone has their personal opinion of what a druggie is. Honestly, thought the substances you have listed aren&#039;t going to grab you and hook you. I think that your wife is more concerned of if you&#039;re going to progress and move onto things such as meth, herion, cocaine, or something that is physically addictive. <br /><br />Since your asking this on the internet. I&#039;m assuming that you and your wife don&#039;t get high together. So i can understand why she is concerned you will move onto harder things. Just what happens when your curiosity gets you or you get bored? You can approach it with the mindset of. &quot;I&#039;m never going to move onto anything else.&quot; And, for your sake i hope you don&#039;t. But, if you&#039;re not honest with yourself when it comes to the future. You might find yourself making choices swiftly without much thought because you thought it could never happen to you. <br /><br />So short answer. No, i don&#039;t think your a druggie. You should talk to your wife and try to express why you enjoy tripping. Who knows maybe she&#039;ll join in.

				You guys are all clearly looking at this from the perspective of druggies trying to deny the obvious reality that you are druggies because of the negative connotations the word holds.<br />A druggy is anyone who habitually uses drugs.<br />It has nothing to do with addiction or if you are in control or if you have dreadlocks or wear a kaftan.<br />A druggy is a habitual drug user.<br />A junkie is an addict (drugs or whatever)<br />An alky is a habitual drinker.<br />I dont judge you , i say go for it but for pittys sake give up this self delusion and accept the fact that you are all druggies.<br />

In fact the negative emotions accompanying the word &#039;&#039;druggie&#039; suggest that its core meaning is actually &#039;a person with a drug problem, a drug addict&#039;, and not simply anyone who uses drugs regularly. It also excludes those who are addicted to such drugs as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, etc. Yes, in a strict sense, a druggie is simply someone who uses drugs, but no one uses the word like that; the connotation of the word predominates over its actual meaning.

				@ acidhead.<br />Well argued but again i think such differentiation is only made within the drug using world. Outside of the drug world any habitual drug user is a druggy , we do not differentiate on the basis of if its a problem or not or what drug is used. I think the attempt to make such differentiation is simply an attempt to enable the comforting self delusion that they&nbsp; are not druggies. Its the other drug users that are druggies , not them. <br />Nothing wrong with being a druggy.

				OK guys so lets think of the OP&#039;s question in these terms:<br /><br />We are the SR team players &#039;The Enlightened&#039;. Whether we buy drugs from the road for recreational or more frequent use - this is the way we do it, it&#039;s normal for most of us ...&nbsp; some of us do it to enhance our way of thinking, to delve deeper into what our world has to offer, to escape, to experiment, to feed a habit, and for loads of other reasons - the SR gives us the opportunity to do this anonomously where some would not have that opportunity. To us that is acceptable - it&#039;s who we are, we&#039;re in it together. <br /><br />Now turn this around. Members of the general public influenced by media etc - to them drugs are bad! This has <br />been ingrained into society since birth. Whether you are experimenting regularly, a feeding a habit or plain just <br />enjoying yourself you are a &#039;drug&#039; user - druggie. There are wives, girlfriends, husbands, boyfriends out there who think like this and somehow you have ended up together. Some feel very strongly others not too much so ... <br /><br />It&#039;s a difficult situation. Do you do it on the quiet? should you be honest and risk your relationship? No-one can tell you what to do - we are all in different situations and relationships are complex at the best of times. Maybe your other half doesn&#039;t mind the drugs but feels the financial cost is too high? or possibly feels left out? fearful of the unknown? fearful of losing you? Mind you, you said you smoke weed all day so no wonder your wife says that! I love weed but if my other half were to be stoned all day well I&#039;d also have something to say!<br /><br />Only you can decide where you&#039;re going with this ... and is it worth it?

I prefer empathogens, psychedelics, stimulants, opiates... well, I really prefer ANYTHING to weed with the exception of benzos &#039;cause they just make me nauseous as all hell. But stimulants help me a lot with some of my ADD tendencies and empathogens help me not be a socially awkward rambling mess when I have to go out and really &#039;deal&#039; with people. So I feel like they&#039;ve helped me far more than weed has when it comes to making me feel like a more productive human being.

My mom told me it did the same for her, and my dad ( who has done FAR more drugs than I have, and more frequently ) never liked weed &#039;cause it made him feel like shit.

				That&#039;s a fucking lot of drugs my friend. The thing that stops you being a druggie (addict) is the variety - you rarely get a true druggy who hasn&#039;t got a drug of choice.You&#039;re just a crazed fat kid in a psychedelic sweet shop.
