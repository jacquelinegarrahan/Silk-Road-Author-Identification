				What a fucking loser. What do you have to do with his shitty relationship? I&#039;m mad just from reading that.<br /><br />In any case, if you want to be extra safe clean house until shit settles down. Either way some guy telling the police you order drugs online isn&#039;t enough to incriminate you. If shit goes down, which I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t, just remember the golden rule: Don&#039;t talk to the police. <br /><br />I&#039;m no lawyer so I have no idea if this information is valid, but if you live in the US this thread is worth a read.<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=29778

				Stash your shit. The easiest reply to the cops is &quot;He thinks I am fucking her so wants to get me into trouble&quot; (if you say anything at all). I wonder if you have any recourse to him filing a false complaint? I dont now about defamation laws and such. Maybe ask the coppers about it&nbsp; ;)

				he&#039;s just hurt as fuck about getting dumped (i even feel for him on some level, but mostly i&#039;m just pissed off with him trying to cause trouble for me just because my friend dumped him) and taking it out on me. we talked it out, came to no real conclusion but a couple people messaged me telling me he&#039;s pulled this shit before in the past after getting dumped. i&#039;m a lot calmer now.&nbsp; <br /><br />sigh!

				Wow, seriously? Thats fucking low for someone to try and rat. Sharing the experience of acid, at least in my opinon...is a great honor....cause idk about you guys, but when im fryin hard, i only like to fry with friends who wont turn the trip into a horrible fucking nightmare later down the road. <br /><br />But from the sounds of it, if he doesnt know how to get to SR, an has no real tangible proof to back up his claims, i highly doubt LE would touch you. =/ police usually have better things to do than deal with some jealous boyfriend

				Lol this is simple. Call his bluff. Tell the guy to fuck off sharpish and if he even thinks about going through with it you will have his nuts snatched out and used for dice. As long as your system is clean and your house is clean what exactly can he prove? Fuck all. What is obvious however is that he has more than enough of a reason to make up some bullshit because he&#039;s just had shit turn sour in his life and SR is a hot topic right now. So yeah...says it all.<br /><br />Tell him to go right ahead, see what he says.

				At least you can say that it&#039;s a lesson learned. I learned from a very young age that you have to pick and chose the people you hang out with carefully.<br />And if i don&#039;t know you or feel I can&#039;t trust you than I won&#039;t let you in my house. I used to be real trusting before. Then when someone does something that puts you or your family in an uncomfortable position. You tend to not be that same trusting person you once were.
