				My eyebrow hairs get long enough to pluck...&nbsp; You might look like Bob Geldof in &quot;The Wall&quot; going to your drug test if you have to shave everything.

				Don&#039;t shave your head - they&#039;ll take a body hair instead, and those grow much slower and will screw you.<br /><br />There are some shampoos that claim to help. But if someone is paying all the money for a hair test, this is pretty serious business.
