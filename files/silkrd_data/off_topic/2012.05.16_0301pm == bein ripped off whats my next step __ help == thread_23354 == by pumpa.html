				Did you FE? If so chalk it up to you not reading the forums and following what has been said a thousand times to not FE.<br /><br />If you are in escrow eventually you will get an option on your purchase to resolve and SR will step in.

				Again it sucks to hear about this type of shit. You definitely should have checked the forums first. There are a lot of legit btc vendors on SR, you just have to do a little research before you trust them with your money. <br /><br />BTCKing has come through for me many times when a good deal comes up and i need btc quick. Hes 100% legit and its as simple as driving to a local bank and making a deposit. You dont even have to go inside the bank. I think hes got like over 1500 transactions all 5/5. <br /><br />Sucks you got scammed bro. This place is the shit though so dont give up.

				This sounds exactly like some other guy who was complaining he got ripped off by Warweed a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; Said he sent the money but in the end never produced any proof.<br /><br />As far as I know, Warweed says right on his profile page now that he no longer does bitcoin transactions because of this very thing.<br /><br />

				In order to prove that you did in fact send the funds to Warweed and he did in fact receive them is to produce his bank account number.&nbsp; A statement showing that an interac transfer went through doesn&#039;t prove anything other than someone accepted the money.<br /><br />If you are on the level, and you did in fact send the money, then you need to contact your bank and get a record of where the money went.<br /><br />When exactly did this transfer take place?

				What brought you to contacting Warweed to purchase BTC?<br /><br />I ask this because I know for a fact he does not have any listings for BTC transactions anymore, not for at least a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I know this because I was looking for an alternate BTC source, and I recalled his profile saying he traded BTC.&nbsp; But he stopped trading BTC several weeks ago because he said it was too much of a hassle.<br /><br />There is a long thread here with someone claiming exactly the same thing you are claiming.&nbsp; So I think you can understand that a lot of people are simply going to believe that you are the same person who has just opened a new forum account to once again raise shit.<br /><br />I will tell you now that claiming Warweed has ripped you off and that your proof is you only gave him the secret password doesn&#039;t really hold any water.&nbsp; Pretty much anyone can use Photoshop to whip up a number of convincing screen shots and other documentation to prove just about anything.<br /><br />The ONLY way you are going to prove anything to anyone is to provide the last four digits of the account number that the money went to.&nbsp; And the problem with that is not only would you have to somehow get the info certified, you would have to get Warweed to agree to do the same thing.&nbsp; All in all a rather complicated solution, but the only one that would provide any real proof.<br /><br />Now, as far as a safe way to purchase BTC, it depends on where you live.&nbsp; If you are in Canada I would suggest using &#039;www.virtex.ca&#039;.&nbsp; You can deposit cash to the RBC and it will credit your Virtex account.&nbsp; Then you simply trade your cash for BTC on their exchange and then transfer the BTC to your own wallet.<br /><br />There are a number of somewhat trusted BTC vendors on SR as well, BTCBuddy, RXKing and a few others.<br /><br />If you had done any research, you would know this.&nbsp; Which is why I am surprised that you somehow say you ended up going to Warweed who hasn&#039;t been doing any BTC trading for several weeks.<br /><br />Even a cursory search of the forums would have turned up numerous threads discussing different BTC vendors and companies, including reviews and ratings.<br /><br />If you are in fact telling the truth about the only thing I think you are going to be able to do is accept the loss and move on, as painful as that may be.&nbsp; The truth is, being a new user with a very low post count, your credibility isn&#039;t very high and you would end up fighting an uphill battle.<br /><br />

Really simple procedure.<br /><br />anyways warweed will be banned shortly. if you ask me it wasn&#039;t even worth it. warweed is a sad welfare bum. needs to scam kids online just to pay his bills because he failed in life.
