If that is an Overtown address I know of the exact building you are referring to.Do not go to that building or anywhere near it. The blue building is a drug house. Without getting into details, I am lucky I escaped with my life from this exact location.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t from there and step foot near that building much less that area there is a good chance you are going to be seriously injured or killed.<br /><br />This is probably the creepiest post I have ever seen. Who the fuck are you, why did you post this address, and what do you hope to achieve by doing this? A few unsolved murders of suburban white kids? LE knows that place is a drug house (I am not talking about some small time shit), which leads me to believe that whoever posted this could be or associated with LE. <br /><br />**EDIT** Did not see the date on this until after I replied. Sorry for bringing up an old topic, but regardless, this is a lot stranger than most will realise, it just so happens that I have been there, and will never forget as it was one of the scariest days of my life.<br />

				Maybe, Perhaps a gold mine for the ultra-brave, ultra-stupid, or those with friends who are ultra-gullible. Get someone to go in there and talk to some sort of boss-figure, and introduce them to the lucrative wonders of NBOMe.

				We have places like that where I&#039;m from. I am happy to stay away and allow them to shoot each other, sell their crack and heroin and pimp those mudsharks. You wouldn&#039;t catch my white ass close to there. Those people want to act like animals we should treat them like animals[ever see escape from New York?] LOL
