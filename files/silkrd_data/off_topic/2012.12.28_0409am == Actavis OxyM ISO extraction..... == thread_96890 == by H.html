				Looking at some 15mg actavis oxymorphones because they definitely seem like the best bang for your buck as far as OM goes. I looked it up and it seems an ISO extraction method is the way to go if one were to IV these, I have some 90% on hand from back when I used to extract Concerta (nice rush).<br /><br />Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows the yield, like if I were to do an ISO extraction (with 91% of course) of 15 mg how many mg about would I end up with after all was said and done/extracted and evaporated?<br /><br />Anyone with experience and/or knowledge? Tips?<br /><br />I did a search and all I found were oppyate&#039;s posting a million different ways about his listing, so if there is a thread on here about this and someone has the link I&#039;d appreciate it.<br /><br />I am dying to try this cause I&#039;ve bought both hydromorphone AND oxymorphone and underestimated my tolerance both times I guess and did not get a rush off either of them so. I just want a proper OM rush,&nbsp; because I&#039;ve never experienced it.<br />Any help is appreciated.

				IDK if i&#039;d go iv with these either, i decided to stop the iso extract of all opana, I had some activis and I believe there might be a wax type filler that will not completely filter out when warm and thus ends up in your bloodstream...snorting them is quite satisfying though.<br />I need to check the activis website to be sure of the fillers, so dont take my word as gospel but rather a safer alternative with a hint of intelligence.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

				Ok after a through period of research the ER formula seems to be a watered down version of the Original 40mg &quot;Stop Sign&quot; OpanaER.<br />They do seem to gel after a bit of moisture.<br />Never the less since the FDA report of a new rare blood disorder caused by injected time release pill ingredients I will never be injecting Oxymorphone again esp. since the nasal ROA works so good for me. I know it sucks for those with high opiate tolerances but would you rather have arm rotten off or simply pass on a drug that was developed to specifically make you not abuse them in such a harmful manner?<br /><br />Also in other news ENDO will be rereleasing a third new time release formulation named&nbsp; &quot;INTACTO&quot; for the rerelease of the 7.5 and 15mg endo version of Opana ER. After the Activis version sales increase 293% after the generic release and Endo decided they could still milk what they thought was a dead cow. A true filthy heartless company Endo is to develop such dirty anti abuse formulations in the name of&nbsp; safety,yet profit so much on the design to deform and cause death to those that seek breakthru pain relief via an IV ROA because of the patients high tolerance to opiates.<br />The poor sad addicts are gonna abuse something why not make it as safe as possible instead of deadly as possible, a true addict doesnt see the harm because they are blinded by the chemical desire.<br /><br />Everyday a new form of greed arises.<br /><br />X)<br />nomad

I have noticed ENDO is an evil brand, apparently the new time release mechanism is even harmful orally taken. People have been experience gastric distress and it is releasing carcinogens which will cause more problems in the long run, not to mention pain patients are saying it doesn&#039;t even release as much of the drug as the older version so it isn&#039;t helping with their pain in the first place.<br />Some companies are so frustrating. <br /><br />Anyway thanks again, sorry I vented a little.
