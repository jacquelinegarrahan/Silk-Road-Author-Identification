				Well, it appears the actual tormail.net site is gone, at least on my end.&nbsp; Can anyone verify this?&nbsp; I&#039;m &quot;fairly&quot; new, so this could be a common occurrence.&nbsp; With the heat being put on, I&#039;m just nervous their site has been compromised - not saying it has, but when the main page says suspended, it get&#039;s me nervous.<br /><br />I remember a disclaimer on there that said something like &quot;this site hosts nothing, shutting it down will do nothing&quot;.&nbsp; Anyone remember that?

				i took the liberty to email the admin at tormail and he replied that he wasnt even aware of the issue and thanked me for letting him know. he reemphasized that nothing is actually hosted on that server. i replied asking him why it was down and asked if he was contacted by and law enforcement. his response was:<br /><br />On Tue, 17 Apr 2012 14:12:49&nbsp; +0100, Admin wrote:<br />&gt; I haven&#039;t been notified of the reason.<br />&gt; The likely cause is phishing/scam complaints which I get a few of,<br />&gt; and got one last night, they probably sent it to the hosting company<br />&gt; too.<br />&gt; <br /><br />I have noticed that since my email the public tormail.net site is now working again. i hope this was just nothing.
