				What do you think of Will and Grace? <br /><br />I find it odd because it was meant to be a groundbreaking show but when you break down the show it&#039;s just a bunch of stereotypes linked together. I just find it odd because if you stereotyped races like this it&#039;d be almost racist. <br /><br />Maybe I just don&#039;t like Will and Grace, maybe I just got out of bed the wrong side this morning.

				The interesting thing about Will and Grace is that there are two supposedly gay characters who never actually do anything gay on camera.&nbsp; They engage in all of the stereotypical behavior associated with being gay, but God forbid they kiss a man or have a consistent long-term relationship.<br /><br />On TV in general, gay characters usually play very minor roles and their characters never develop.&nbsp; Even Modern Family, which has a prominent gay couple, their characters are the least developed on the show.&nbsp; They supposedly have a daughter, but she is only used as a prop for the two gay characters arguments (because all they do is argue).

				I feel like lesbians are often over the top stereotypes, as I&#039;ve known many lesbians none of which were attractive at all which is the first stereotype, and none wore flannel - although one did have short spikey hair and wore mens suits.<br /><br />However, of the gay men I have met several were very stereotypical flamboyant gay men.<br /><br />If you&#039;re bored enough to watch Will &amp; Grace, here are some ideas for other shows I&#039;ve been watching online this week: Trailer Park Boys (3rd time I&#039;ve watched them all), Eastbound &amp; Down (2nd time I&#039;ve watched them all, Season 1 is the best though), The Wire, Breaking Bad

I already watch The Wire. :)<br /><br />Will and Grace just strike me as an odd show because it&#039;s just a string of stereotypes about gay people strung together in various orders for about 22 minutes an episode, rinse, then repeat. It strikes me that if say any show did that about say black culture or something like that it&#039;d just get stamped as racist whereas this is praised for celebrating stereotypes.&nbsp; ???

				Don&#039;t understand how you can watch those TV shows, it feels like I turn into a patato, good for passing time but eh...<br />When you scrutinize any sitcom you&#039;ll see they all have similar features, just like you&#039;ve found in Will and Grace, they&#039;re all just as fake and stereotypical as the next.<br /><br />I suggest not wasitng your time there, really.<br />Reminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6LUptADIww<br /><br />View that in your normal browser though, don&#039;t slow down the TOR network for something so pointless.
