				www.bitcoin.org<br /><br />Download the client and leave it running to download the blockchain, this will take some time.<br />Select the option to encrypt wallet.<br />Keep your bitcoins safe and sound on your own computer, it is the safest way to keep them.<br />For extra security after you have closed down the client move the wallet.dat to a Truecrypt container and hide it there. Make sure to copy it back BEFORE you reopen the client.

				I don&#039;t believe any online wallet/btcbank/exchangesite is safe to keep big amount of coins.<br /><br />Backup and encrypt the wallet.dat in a pendrive.<br /><br />Or read:<br />http://startbitcoin.com/how-to-create-a-secure-bitcoin-wallet/<br />https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet

				I used to use the official client but I don&#039;t want to leave it running because it consumes a fuckload of bandwidth these days verifying everyone elses transactions.<br /><br />So I&#039;m a selfish fuck who uses Multibit, which is a lot quicker and I don&#039;t have to wait for ten minutes to an hour every time I start it up. In a few minutes it has synchronized, but it is less centralized. I can always go back to Bitcoin when politicians fuck with it&#039;s centralized nature anyway. At the moment it is the best choice.<br /><br />You need to TrueCrypt your hard drive, and I recommend a virtual machine so stupid shit can&#039;t be installed that takes your coins.
