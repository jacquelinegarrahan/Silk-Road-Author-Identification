				Well i have a choice.&nbsp; Meeting with that group, but where the blue arrow points me is right outside the gates and i get attacked by three brutes.&nbsp; The other mission is to meet the greywolves or whatever on the otherside of the mountain.<br /><br />I am pretty fucked though.&nbsp; My char has 1 gold and even if i sell all my items it makes less than 1000.<br /><br />Should i struggle on with this or create a&nbsp; new char?&nbsp; I started playing as a human.

				Yeah sorry i have basically started the game.<br />I have cleared the level where you have to kill the spider and get the dragon claw, match up the symbols on the round door.<br />After that, i havnt got a fucking clue.<br />As for rapid leveling i need tips, im nearly lvl 4 lol.&nbsp; This might help explain things (i hope).

				Basically it&#039;s easy to level up by just doing loads of blacksmith stuff or basically letting pussy opponents hit you so you develop your armor levels. Another good one is sneaking as well coz you can just walk in one direction while people are asleep. By the time I am where you are I&#039;m about level 15+ lol. :P

				Ahhh, Bleak Falls Barrow. You open the door with the claw, and walk forward. There should be a word wall.

Also using Enchanting means you can get better shit than a lot of what you find so you can jack your magic and magic regeneration (or whatever is important to you) easily with that. <br /><br />Basically the key skills you should deffo pick are -<br /><br />Sneak <br />Destruction/One Handed+Block/Two Handed+Block(whichever suits ya to kick arse)<br />Restoration<br />Lock Picking<br />Smithing (earns ya ££££) <br />Enchanting <br /><br />All the others are fairly here or there but they can be useful if you want to be really in depth with how you play.<br /><br />Oh yeah and Lord of War is sick, that guy is my idol.

				I&#039;ve put about 400 hours into skyrim and its the best fucking thing i&#039;ve ever played. the best way to level yourself is not just to focus on one mundane task like blacksmithing, but to work things that you have no intention to use as your character (blocking or heavy armour for a mage for example) in order to gain additional points to raise the skills you do want to level. <br /><br />sneaking,stealing,attacking the guards only once (as not to gain too much of a bounty) and&nbsp; blocking and healing their attacks. wearing different types of armour, having a backup bow so you can fire a few shots in early aswell as gain a few exp points.<br /><br />i cant play skyrim anymore, if i touch water the game totally freezes, and im too anal to save my 400+ hour save.

				So far for me Skyrim is the best thing too.&nbsp; I know i am only short on playing the game but, fuck me.&nbsp; Even when you are selecting your talent trees and see the fucking nebulae i was like HOLY SHIT!.<br /><br />Once again, thanks for all the advice.&nbsp; I will do whatever it takes to level up quickly.<br />I did start again as a High Elf but then i thought, ah magic, it might be a bit complicated for my first time so im thinking about being a human again.

Happened to me i think on To Kill an Empire... lost Lydia for a good while, and nothing worked to get her back. Then she randomly showed up one day to my great relief.

DO NOT exit you have to put the book on to the bookshelf after reading it! Then you pick up the book and it will open it choose the &quot;Dont read now&quot; option and you will be carrying it again.You then do it all over again you do the interact with bookshelf you read it to gain 5 levels and then put it on the bookshelf then you put it on the bookshelf.Over and over until all levels are 100! Goodluck it gets kind of boring when you kill dragons in 1 hit and nothing can hurt you!
