				First of all, is this the right forum for drug related talk? I was thinking about posting on the drug safety board but it&#039;s not totally related. <br /><br />I had this ounce of psilocybin mushroom a while ago. No idea on strain just some random shit I got from the streets. I dosed 2g&#039;s once after giving blood(like 5 hours after) and it was one of the strongest psychedelic experience I&#039;ve ever had. As I was coming out of my magical sleep, I couldn&#039;t explain what I was seeing. It&#039;s like the parts of my brain involved in language were affected and I couldn&#039;t have an internal monologue. Totally the weirdest feeling(although not unpleasant) I&#039;ve ever experienced.<br /><br />Since then I&#039;ve tripped on 3.5g&#039;s of the same batch and everything was less intense and seemingly the language parts of my brain weren&#039;t affected as much.<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious if anyone ever tripped after giving blood and noticed a difference? I hadn&#039;t taken mushrooms for a couple years before that though, maybe that could explain it. The trips before were lsd ( like 3 one hit trips and two 2 hit trips, lsd in a sugar cube, no idea purity or amount, which is one of the main reasons I&#039;m now on silk road).<br /><br />I&#039;m probably going to go back to give blood just to test it out and see if I can verify it does intensify trips. Anyone knowledgeable in neuroscience/medicine have a theory?

				Ahaha, sounds excellent my man!<br /><br />I have not done drugs after giving blood, but I have had sex after giving blood.<br /><br />Let me tell you, it was quite the best. Delirious sex. <br /><br />We both came and we both passed out, woke up 10 minutes later in the same position wondering what the hell happened.<br /><br />Exquisite.
