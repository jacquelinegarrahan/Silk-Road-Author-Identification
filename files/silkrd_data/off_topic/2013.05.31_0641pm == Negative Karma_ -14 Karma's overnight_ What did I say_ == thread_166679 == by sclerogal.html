Some people get their kicks by living life to the max, others get their kicks from getting 14 accounts up to 100 posts on an anonymous forum so as they can hand out anonymous internet points.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry too much about it - somebody&#039;s just being an idiot and trying to annoy people on the forums.<br /><br />Libertas

One would wonder.<br /><br />The person who was derailing my thread was samesame, and the evidence is there if you look at his posts. So if you had an issue with members not talking about the original topic then why didn&#039;t you talk to him?<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				OP - you didn&#039;t say anything, there are just users who either have too much time on their hands (and maybe should do something else with them - like fuck off) or have found a way to take advantage of the karma system.&nbsp; Either way, it&#039;s nothing that you said - this mass-negging has been happening to many of us over the last few weeks (including inigo and DPR who don&#039;t even post often).

				set up one account where you say controversial stuff, state your true beliefs about things, and be independent minded. you&#039;ll get lots of negative karma.<br /><br />set up another account where you are nice, agree with everyone, and practice conformism. that&#039;ll get you lots of positive rep.

				Raz - you are a smart guy, so how are you not putting 1 and 1 together?&nbsp; People all over the forums are being negged around 14x over the course of a few minutes.&nbsp; People who have said nothing wrong, done nothing wrong, and some who have not even posted lately (DPR and inigo, for example).&nbsp; Are you seriously of the belief that me, SSBD, and Libertas are sitting here all day long negging random members 14 times for shits and giggles?&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; Princess receiving -14 is part of this same pattern - it was NOT me, it was NOT SSBD, it was NOT Libertas.&nbsp; DPR and inigo rarely post here and yet they, too, have been part of this mass-negging.<br /><br />

				This is clearly a widespread issue of mass-negging.&nbsp; However much some of you want to believe the conspiracies you&#039;ve come up with, the fact of the matter is that your conspiracies are not based in reality this time.&nbsp; At the same time, it&#039;s clear you won&#039;t be convinced, so what is the point in any of us trying to defend against your accusations?&nbsp; If you&#039;re not going to listen, then there&#039;s nothing more we can do, but I&#039;m tired of trying to defend myself and the other mods to people who are going to think what they want to think regardless of the truth.<br /><br />This thread has once again devolved into useless drivel and baseless accusations so at this point I say: believe what you want.&nbsp; It&#039;s a shame though because this is probably exactly what the mass-negging people wanted to see happen.&nbsp; :-\ <br />
