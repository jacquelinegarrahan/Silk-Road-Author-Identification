				So I got two bad reviews from the same buyer, and I highly suspect that it is a particular vendor.<br /><br />Same typing style as Moon&nbsp; Unit. Placed an order in the midst of one of our heated discussions. One of the bad reviews says he never received it (the order was shipped out less than a week ago!). The other says that my stuff is bad, when it&#039;s quite clearly just about the best quality you can get.<br /><br />Really I just shouldn&#039;t be getting bad reviews in general, and now the fact that I have two from the same person giving bogus reviews who type exactly like Moon Unit... something must be up.<br /><br />Luckily, it only brought me down from 100.0% to 99.6%. Not sure how the math works out on that one.<br /><br />Anyways, maybe I just needed to vent. Maybe I&#039;m really sad that I don&#039;t have 100.0% anymore. :(

				As SR is anonymous, this is impossible to prevent.<br />&nbsp;:(<br /><br />Edit: Scratch that, you could try setting buyer restrictions. Make the buyer have been here a month with a few buys before they can order from you. Competitors won&#039;t want to wait and have to buy other products before giving you bad feedback. Obviously, this still has drawbacks too, yet the cost of being anonymous brings such.
