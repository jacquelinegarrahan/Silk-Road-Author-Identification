				I am disgusted to find out that there are people reselling my new identity guide.<br />I assure you that whenever I find out those selling my guide, I&#039;ll remove them forever from my list for future updates of the guide.<br /><br />I am doing an extra effort to keep all of you safe upgrading and even using the arcane Private Messaging system in SR to notify every one of you if there is an important information to keep you two steps ahead of LEA.<br /><br />To find out that some people are exploiting and abusing my efforts, I&#039;ll have to take preventive and offensive measures to protect my interests.<br />But mainly what really hurts is the lack of respect and the lack of appreciation for the background work I am STILL doing for YOUR safety.<br /><br />Anyone out there, please give a quick glance to the products I offer, you should be smart enough to realize of how resourceful I am.<br />It is really really STUPID to even try to betray someone like me. Those who are negotiating stupid deals behind my back, you should be really grateful that I have strong ethics and principles.<br /><br />Your identity will be always safe with me, I will never snitch you out even if you are stabbing me in my back.<br />But I will do anything in my power to identify you and blacklist you from all the vendor lists, and to make sure that I will never ever give you any kind of support or products from me.<br /><br />============<br />BTW, to those PIGS who tried to get me: GOOD FUCKING TRY.<br />You&#039;ll need more undercover agents to get me, do you think I am THAT amateur?

				I for see another vague ominious post that never explains the dynamics of the situation so the community can be better informed about LE <br /><br />Seems this is popular with people, and hardly ever get a sensible explanation.

				Hold on Sports Fans....hoooooold right the fuck on there for one second. <br /><br />If I was a smart man, which I like to think I am. Given how security conscious Peach is I doubt the girl is going to give you a blow-by-blow account of how 5-O tried to sting her. Given that she just gave a resounding fuck you to pigs on here clearly they are quite probably on here HOWEVER if they tried to sting her IRL then just looking at how someone describes a failed sting identifies exactly who they are purely on the fact that the rozzers keep records of how all their shit goes down...failed or successful.....<br /><br />Jesus that second sentence was long....<br /><br />But yeah...think about it guys...

				Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s general, still extremely unwise.<br /><br />Fact is that compared to the vast majority of us, Peach works in a niche market. How many drug dealers do the rozzers catch in the act compared to people that do high quality IDs/Passports/New ID instructions. Take that number and then weed out the ones on SR...that leaves Peach solo. Even if a general overview of the attempt was given it&#039;s enough to pin Peach IF the sting was done IRL. If it was done on here there is room for maneuver but even then, not much. <br /><br />

But you are comparing pears with apples.<br />I am not defending copyright, I am not selling art.<br />I am selling the know-how of how to beat the system, and unfortunately security through obscurity is the key factor that keeps this system alive.<br /><br />If some of my dumbest customers start giving away the information in these guides, it will become obsolete extremely fast.<br />Auditors and other specialists already know about this cracks in the system, but they are still doing nothing about it because it is not widespread and as long as it is not a priority or national concern, they will not do anything about it.<br /><br />Political willpower is based on demagogy basically, and you Anarcho know probably will agree on this as well.<br />As soon as the public attention is brought to this matters, this will be over. Lawmakers and policy makers only move their asses when they are pressed by the media and the public opinion. They are slaves of the mass hysteria.<br />And if this guide becomes more popular than it should be, it will be the end very soon.<br /><br />I specified in every Private Message when I delivered the guide, I explained very clearly and concisely in the Second Note:<br />&quot;Please, don&#039;t reveal the information contained in the guide to anyone else, if the word gets spread out it will definitely alert the authorities, which will end up changing the rules to make this method obsolete. Keep this method to yourself only.&quot;<br /><br />Those who can&#039;t respect these measures, don&#039;t deserve having the guide.<br />Why? because If you can&#039;t see the big picture, sooner or later you&#039;ll end up being caught.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20991.msg213785#msg213785">Quote from: Limetless on April 29, 2012, 05:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s general, still extremely unwise.<br /><br />Fact is that compared to the vast majority of us, Peach works in a niche market.
