				I&#039;m personally&nbsp; in over two figures with lightecoins. Their about $4 usd/coin atm and the maximum amount their can be is 4x that of bitcoin so it would make sense for it to make it to 1/4 of bc price with in the next year or two and especially when silkroad implements their use which will happen to keep up with competition. Their also faster than bc to trade transactions taking minutes which means it would be usable at a place like a resteraunt.

				Is that confirmed LTC will be listed eventually on Mt.Gox?<br /><br />I think it was just a tweet from some guy from Mt.Gox, something like that..

Has he/she set a date yet? We went over the BTC vs LTC debate in early April, but I wouldn&#039;t want to rely on LTC as an investment and expect the same return as bitcoins, though, for the reasons expounded in those posts.<br /><br />0:)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				Litecoins are still new, once they are listed, i can see them being around maybe $10-$15 per ltc.<br /><br />LTC will be the next currency to be listed sure, if i had enough change to spare, i&#039;d buy quite a few of them when they drop to around $1.20 a coin, and just hold onto them. Just be sure to back up your wallet, etc before you send the coins to it, some people have sent coins to neverland, never to get them back. Its like they have some bot, constantly searching for unguarded coins, so if you do invest, back up that wallet. ;)
