				I noticed that there&#039;s a new site coming offering hydroponics &amp; nutes. I found this on a bitcoin talk forum.<br />&nbsp; They say it&#039;s a bitcoin only site offering PGP &amp; Stealth shipping UK &amp; some EU counties <br />I can all ready see some&nbsp; new weed vendors popping up&nbsp; !!&nbsp; you can buy cuttings and seeds on SR all the growing kit at the site and never have to get caught walking/driving in and out grow shops again by cop or robbers all so if your ordering online all ready means your using paypal / bank which is not the best.<br /><br />I Thinks it&#039;s the perfect way and i all ready support them/him/her ;]<br /><br />

				Mclovin has a tormail account;&nbsp; mclovin@ tormail.org. Or something. <br />He&#039;s contacted growers before and also has a entry at startups dot com <br /><br />It&#039;s a good idea for a site though buddy. It&#039;s just in this game, trust is everything.&nbsp; You have to find a way to demonstrate your trust to people.&nbsp; Put something of yourself on the line and then people will trust you.&nbsp; Until then, you are creating a one stop place to find growers? <br /><br />&nbsp;I guess they can sell on the site as well as receive supplies for their grow op.&nbsp; That part is scary.&nbsp; Having anything delivered to a grow op is a bad idea.&nbsp; But not if you have a license to grow.

				Not being rude but i never heard of start up dot com and i don&#039;t contact growers , i dont have a account @tormail.org<br />I all so don&#039;t own or plan to run it this website just think it has potential as i love to grow and have been for 10 years and going to the shop is a right pain in ass!<br /><br /><br />
