				Precisely. I mean, i can understand the concept of wanting a loan....but i mean come on....You really think were gonna give handouts to someone with 1 post, and apparently a horrible reputation in this community? Puh-leez <br /><br />Something tells me the Mods or Admins should make a designated Loan Thread, only viewable by Sr. Members and above.
