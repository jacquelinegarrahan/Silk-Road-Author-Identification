				I could supply SIM cards from a well known european gsm provider, no personal info required and the phone number is sent by sms. The cards have ~7 euros on them and they have roaming agreements worldwide so you can use it in any country. Would you buy it on SR ?

				It has been said often enough, but I will repeat it still:<br />You need to get rid of the old phone, too.<br />Just changing the SIM-card will not be sufficient, the phone itself is sending a code (called IMEI) which most operators,<br />at least in Europe, save like the IMSI (SIM-identifier) and the MSISDN (phone-number).<br />It might be possible to change the IMEI with certain phones, but unless you are absolutely sure that<br />the method works, better buy cheap phones together with the SIM-cards. SIMlock or no doesn&#039;t matter since you<br />will want to use one SIM in the phone only anyway.

				You&#039;re perfectly right there sbaxter, the best option would be to buy cheap &quot;burn phones&quot;, but we don&#039;t have that either in Europe because you have to provide an id when buying one.

Enough time and you get used to cameras on the streets, police routine controls or neighbors not minding their business but yours.<br /><br />/off topic <br /><br />Still offering the SIM cards here. You could get them for 50-70 euros on the street and call it a price, combine that with an easy to change IMEI phone and you&#039;re off the radar. All cards have an initial credit of aprox. 5-7 euros on them. I could sell for 1/3 street price on SR and still make a fair profit.

				Looks good but I imagine customers will want the item shipped from UK - plus at £80 the cost is a bit steep.<br /><br />An excellent idea in principle though.
