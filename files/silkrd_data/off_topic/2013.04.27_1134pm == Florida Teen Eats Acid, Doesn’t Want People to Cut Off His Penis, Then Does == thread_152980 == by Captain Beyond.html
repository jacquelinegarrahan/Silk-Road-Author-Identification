				Florida Teen Eats Acid, Doesn’t Want People to Cut Off His Penis, Then Does<br /><br />Some people trip balls. Others trip just above the balls.<br /><br />This is Michael Joseph Silecchia. He’s lucky to wake up every day with his dick attached.<br />“A University of Florida student was arrested for a Saturday incident in which he was wandering around naked, making random statements about God and, first, telling people not to cut off his penis and then to cut it off, Gainesville police reported,” according to The Gainesville Sun.<br />Make up your mind, kid. Want to be Lord Varys or don’t you?<br /><br />It doesn’t much matter: Police arrived and engaged the tripping 19-year-old, who eventually felt the repeated sting of a Taser, which couldn’t compare with the electricity already flowing through his veins.<br />Silecchia was told several times to dress himself, but refused, the report states. He tried to walk away from police and was physically restrained, prompting a struggle with police.<br />Police got Silecchia to the ground, but he punched an officer in the head. He was Tased about six times with no effect, the report states.<br />You could probably make the case, as you often can, that police intervention made this particular situation worse. But you could also see a situation in which without police help, Silecchia could very well be a eunuch right now.<br /><br />Read more at http://hypervocal.com/news/2013/bad-acid-florida-police/#YIPHMh6c5K969qdX.99&nbsp; <br />

				Once upon a time over a friend&#039;s apartment, I was introducing a few people to 25x salvia extract. I was the baby sitter during the experimentation process. All was well with a few of my friends having an interesting 15 minutes. One of the roommates comes home during the smoke sessions and expresses interest in attempting the experience. I torch up the bong and he ends up ripping a massive hit. About 20 seconds after he exhales, the guy stands up and runs out of the apartment and jumps off of the balcony. It happened so quickly, we were in all shock. Fortunately he didn&#039;t injure himself and was able to get it together a few minutes after standing up from the fall. This was on the second floor...

				My friend the roomate who initially wanted to try the salvia extract had an interesting time too. Nothing bad of course; I locked us into his bedroom and removed any sharp object or things which could be broken. So he hits the bong . immediately&nbsp; after exhaling he starts repeating &quot; I don&#039;t feel it&quot;. The funny thing is that his voice which started in a soft murmur increased to a yell over the course of a minute. He tried to stand up at this point but I wa able to hold him down. Savlia is fucking nuts. Once was enough for me.
