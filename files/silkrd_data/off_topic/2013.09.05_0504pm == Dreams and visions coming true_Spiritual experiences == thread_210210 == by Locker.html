				I thought It would be good to make a thread that I can share my recent experience and let others do the same.<br />This is a thread for you to share your experiences of Visions or Dreams that have ever come true. (By this I mean things happening in your dreams or visions, coming true in real life), or simply any spiritual experiences that you would like to share;<br /><br />I thought I&#039;d share a recent experience that I can&#039;t quite understand If it is just a coincidence or if there truly was a vision there, but it was quite scary to say the least. <br />I have been meditating for a good 4/5 months now (Hermetic meditation), and usually meditate every other night. I&#039;ve got to the point in meditation where I can experience pretty intense Third Eye Visions (Usually enhanced by Weed), but this night it was alot different. I didn&#039;t feel the usual energy that I would feel when falling into the third eye, It just happened and I could see a vision straight away and extremely clearly. (Clear, although vivid) <br /><br />The first things that I remember seeing is me looking up at a big pair of cemetery gates, opening on their own as I walked through the cemetery. Everything was dark, apart from one spot;There were 4 graves at the end of the path, the illumination seemingly coming from nowhere but the graves were bright and something was pulling me towards them. There were really small graves, both set touched each other one one side of the path, then a few metres away there was a big grave. <br /><br />That&#039;s all I remember seeing as I exited my 3rd eye experience, but I didn&#039;t know what the graves were meant to be or meant to mean, but I just accepted it and carried on as usual. The next day, I found a very close friend of mine&#039;s bipolar wife had caught him cheating and gone mental. She had killed all 3 of the kids and then killed herself. Of course I was genuinely upset for my friend, but all i could think about was the vision that I had had the previous day.<br /><br />As it turns out, the 3 children were all buried with the gravestones touching next to each other, and the mother was buried on another part of the same graveyard. The graveyard had a big gate (Not the same as in the vision, but still a large gate) as an entrance. <br /><br />The whole thing was horrific for my friend, but I still don&#039;t know what to think of my vision, I haven&#039;t had anything happen to me like this before.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />What are some of your experiences of visions coming to true/spiritual happenings?<br />Would love to hear them!<br />Locker.&nbsp; :)

I have never meditated on anything other than weed, and plan to try some psychedelics. <br /><br />This will probably happen Sunday, as tomorrow I have a party (Much love for that), so that&#039;s something I am looking forward to.<br />Locker.
