				Sounds immature but I like to have some kind of toy, just something soft or plushy or colorful I can fidget around with. If it lights up all the better. <br /><br />For deep solo trips I like to have a lava lamp or something &quot;warm&quot; looking that I can turn my attention to and let myself drift off.

				I like stuff like butterfly knifes and poker chips, things that I can do the same &quot;trick&quot; with repeatedly and sometimes on a really good trip something just &quot;clicks&quot; and I figure a new trick out with out actually trying it, it sounds mad but its happened a few times now&nbsp; :o

				Very serious answer- A vibrator! LSD seems to convert the pain of taking one in the ass into pleasure. It&#039;s really fantastic and makes the visuals vibrate too.<br /><br />For the non-females/fags here, a bright colored light- my personal favorite being a blue sunlamp. Being in complete darkness then flashing it for a second or two can create very intense closed-eye animations; and if I&#039;d prefer to keep my eyes open, leaving it on really intensifies the colors of the room.

				Youtube open on a 3-D rendering of a Mandlebrot Fractal.. That shit is so intense I swear you can trip watching with or without drugs.<br /><br />It&#039;s the most beautiful thing maths ever produced and if you haven&#039;t seen one I strongly, strongly recommend taking a look.. Seriously just do it:<br /><br />Clearnet:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWyOX7TUd6w (one of many)

				I just go with all the clutter i&#039;ve amassed in my room.&nbsp; Or someone else&#039;s clutter.<br /><br />Any time we think &quot;oh we&#039;re gonna trip with this&quot; we just end up ignoring that object.&nbsp; Kind of loses interest.<br /><br />Otherwise... a UK press Black Sabbath Vertigo record tends to trap people more than anything.&nbsp; I need to try and hypnotize someone with one of them :p

				Head massagers have been a blast, also instruments! Saxophone, guitar, bass, I play it all while I&#039;m tripping. My band and I all dropped ~500ug and just jammed for like 4 hours. We recorded it and it&#039;s the funniest thing I ever heard. One person will try to take the lead and get something going and the fizzle out but the next person tries to pick it up and they just fizzle out. Many laughs were had.
