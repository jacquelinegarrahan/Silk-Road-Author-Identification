				whatever you do, you have to consider that you&#039;ll be mixing it with a stimulant.<br />Nothing mixes that well with stimulants (IME), especially not other stimulants.<br /><br />Perhaps you&#039;re looking at klonopin, it sounds like it should do the job, I&#039;m not sure what specific meds you&#039;re on.<br />Methylphenidate? dexamphetamine?<br /><br />If I were you, I&#039;d get off the ADHD meds, fuck them. <br />You should find your own way to adapt, find something which works with you.

Make sure you don&#039;t take a high dose though, unless you want to feel groggy all day. IMO weed isn&#039;t a great drug for social anxiety, it&#039;s always made me feel agitated. But drugs effect people differently... maybe weed does help some people. MDMA wouldn&#039;t be great as you can only take it once a month to feel the full effects... Once a fortnight would even be pushing it a little.

				.25-.5mg of xanax and you&#039;re golden, I used to have social anxiety and after my doctor prescribed me these I fell in love with xanax, I don&#039;t even have to take it anymore&nbsp; ;) Use it sparingly though and don&#039;t depend on it, you should only take it if you can&#039;t handle the anxiety.

Most people I know that genuinely need adderall seem pretty reserved on it. But your right about benzos and opiates, my sister has adhd and if she took a 30mg addy she&#039;d be in a stoned state, but she speeds on opiates.<br /><br />I would try smoking MORE weed also, small amounts might make you more anxious but getting beyond that threshold might be the key.

				I like GHB. If you find the right dose it really helps with social anxiety without impairing your judgement like alcohol does. Plus I think it is less addictive/detrimental than benzos. I think you can mix it with adhd meds but don&#039;t take my word for it. I take it sometimes when I&#039;m coming down from adderall and really enjoy it but that&#039;s just me.

I remember when I was younger I would have anxiety if I was high around family or any public setting that I didn&#039;t want anyone to know. <br /><br />Now days, I can clear away anxiety from any setting or situation by smoking, even just a couple hits so I&#039;m still fully functional. If I took molly or coke, all functionality for me is gone. You can self medicate with weed where you smoke a bit in the morning, bit mid day, and more after work to wind down. You couldn&#039;t do that on molly, period, and coke is much better served as recreational drug rather than having a dependence on it.

				I also have severe social anxiety and I recommend Valium for sure man, I&#039;ve tried all the benzos and it just seems to be the most effective for social anxiety, Xanax seems to give me more of a rush so I&#039;d be careful with it as it&#039;s known to be pretty addictive. I&#039;ve been on Valium 20-30mg a day for about 6 months and I&#039;ve been so motivated and happy even at the darkest of times, I&#039;ve made so many new friends, business partners and hot girls, it really is a wonderful drug. I also don&#039;t need to drink when going out so I save money as well. I&#039;m hoping to get off Valium soon and try CBT to cure it for good. Best of luck to you man, it really is a horrible disorder.

				If you want it for a general, every day social anxiety then try propranolol, as someone above suggested. It really is good, it&#039;s safe, you can stay on it long time and your doctor will have no problem giving it to you. And you won&#039;t get any sort of &quot;Ahhhhh&quot; (as I like to call it) from it.<br /><br />Alternatively, as everyone else has suggested benzos...

				Careful with self-medicating on benzos...&nbsp; if you get yourself physically dependent on them and lose your connection you = fucked<br /><br />Withdrawal from benzos is right up there with methadone...&nbsp; it lasts forever and literally everything hurts and you will be under a constant soul-crushing depression until things get back to normal assuming they ever do.&nbsp; Talk to your doctor before you take a risk like taking black market pills long term.

				Regarding the varied opinions on weed as an anti-anxiety -<br /><br />I&#039;ve had the full range of experiences on different strains. The first thing one needs to do before trying to use weed to cure social anxiety is figure out what strains they&#039;re smoking and whether the strains are more indica, afghanica, or sativa. I personally have a strong preference for sativa leaning to pure sativa strains, as the highs I get are more clear-headed. Indica&#039;s tend to stone my ass and lock me to the couch and in my head, raising my anxiety levels as I feel like I may have gotten myself too high to contribute to group discussion (rising anxiety due to fear of having committed social faux pas). Sativas, though, leave me clear headed and creative so that I can contribute more effectively than when sober, alleviating anxiety entirely.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always experienced the two ends of the spectrum from a single bag. First, I was treating the plant and the high with no respect. Not paying any attention to it. It slapped me and made me its bitch - I smoked and became useless. Then I meditated on what the high can do for me and what it can teach me, and the next day instead of clouding my mind further it evaporated them as I focused on appreciation and respect for the tool I&#039;d been given.<br /><br />It depends so much on how you do it, it&#039;s silly to say yes or no to weed as a whole for social anxiety.
