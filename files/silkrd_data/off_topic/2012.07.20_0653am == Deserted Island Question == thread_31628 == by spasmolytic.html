				Okay, I may catch grief for this, but here it goes &amp; remember it&#039;s just for fun, although it may serve as a gauge of some sort.<br />If you were stranded on a deserted island alone and could only have one, would you rather have music, sex, or your drug/drugs of choice?<br />For me, nothing gets me where I want to go like music, thankfully back in reality we get it all, but goddamn I love music like nothing else.

				It&#039;s a tough choice between music and weed for me, I hate people too much to be bothered by sex compared to those two options. But in the end music will always win for me. The Doors &amp; Grateful Dead man, enough said. ;)

				A big nod to the poster who mentioned books.<br />Thats a big yes from me.&nbsp; Sure you can get high, have sex, listen to music but reading a fucking good book gets you lost in your own imagination.&nbsp; Imagine having a couple of decades worth of reading material and then someone comes to rescue you.<br />You would be the smartest fucker who made it back home to mainland.<br /><br />I do like music, but my music list is like, as random as you could think.

				Definitely the drugs.. because you need something to get you &quot;away&quot; from those times when you&#039;re stuck in your head.<br />Or else you&#039;ll go nuts and fry for life... then get ravaged by land sharks and eaten by some naked Albino Indian Cannibal.
