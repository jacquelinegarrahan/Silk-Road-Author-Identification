				I want to start making RC&#039;s, crystal meth, and stuff of that nature. In the United states what would be a good location to make said facility and where would I get workers who wouldnt talk and would work for cheap.

If you want a facility in the states that can do commercial quantities you will probably have to at least spend £50K just to get a decent set up with the raw materials + chemists and on top of that you have the logistics of getting all that shit which could cost you the same amount again because you have to develop the contacts to do it. It&#039;s not like you can just set up a lab and get your shit to make Meth overnight, you need to work your contacts over a long period of time. <br /><br />If you are really serious I&#039;m actually looking to get rid of my 50L Double-Jacket Reactor for £10K when the price purchased is usually £18K. If you do actually go down this road just think about it properly, it&#039;s not for most people, in fact a very small %. For 99% it&#039;s just a pipe-dream.

You have to recruit professors directly out of university or workers that already work in the chemical industry specifically in Organic Chemistry. Also you don&#039;t want them to use drugs because it makes them greedy and unreliable. <br /><br />Seriously OP, don&#039;t quit your day job. Like someone else who did a &quot;Please teach me how to make MDMA&quot;. If you are doing a thread asking that, you aren&#039;t cut out for the job. <br /><br />Also, what makes me suspicious of you is that you are doing things in reverse. You don&#039;t make your bank and then get into the drug trade, you get into the drug trade to make bank and then go straight. If $300K is nothing to you then you don&#039;t need to be doing this and you wont have the instinct for it now because it&#039;ll be far too late for you to convert your mindset. <br /><br />Like I said, leave it to the pros.

Eventually you may need to hire some help but I can assure you that having employees makes things many many times as dangerous.

I&#039;m not saying these people with connections are bad people but you have to remember that they are mainly working here to raise money for their family and eventually get everyone to move here.

				This has to be the funniest thread I have ever read. You clearly do not use drugs or even know anyone that simply is involved in the drug world AT ALL, not even USERS. Have a shit load of money and all of a sudden want to &quot;break bad&quot; and start cooking meth? It is actually laughable that you are asking how to do this, because anyone on the internet that needs advice on this is NOT capable of doing it. Lets say you even do get a lab set up with a professional chemist cooking you batches of meth. Do you have any idea it is to even sell a single pound of meth? a .2 of a gram will last even a heavy user all night.....most bummy ass users buy a 100 or 200 milligrams for a NIGHT so even moving an OUNCE would be a fucking bitch. But oh your just gonna find some trusty workers start a lab and then meet people to take pounds of your product that will actually work with you and not just be some organized crime group that kills you and takes your whole lab or even worse than dying would be getting popped in which you would be sent to jail for a MIN of 20 years most likely. Stick with your day job. As lim said, do you think I love knowing I could get arrested at any point because I am a drug dealer? I am going to make it in this game and as soon as my stack is high enough I am OUT and completely legit.....I do love what I do but the stress of it would kill an older man......

				Yeah basically what RobertBennet said only maybe with a bit of sugar coating on top. <br /><br />I&#039;ve gotta say as well, that to think that producing is just a pick-up-and-go affair is just a ridiculous underestimation of the task. I&#039;ve been doing this for the best part of 10 years to get to production so it&#039;s a little insulting lol. <br /><br />And for me high enough is £10 Mil.
