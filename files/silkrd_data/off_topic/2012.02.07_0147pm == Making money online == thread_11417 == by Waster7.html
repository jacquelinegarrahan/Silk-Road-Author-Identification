				I&#039;m still in school and absolutely broke. I&#039;m living with my divorced mother and she barely makes ends meat. There is no jobs, believe me. I can&#039;t get any welfare or anything because I&#039;m still in full time education.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to give you all my little sob story, but I really want to be able to afford some things. It sucks not having money to do stuff, or even buy some clothes. I eat like a horse and I really want to be able to help my mother out. It&#039;s what I hope to do here.<br /><br />Problem is, I have no money to even begin with.<br />I&#039;m not looking to even make it a full time job, just a few bucks.. don&#039;t mind putting in a shift and I know most methods won&#039;t instantly get me money.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried other sites and even bought ebooks and methods, with no success really.<br />I&#039;m hoping here (because it&#039;s more secluded) that somebody can genuinely help me, without shoving referral links down my throat. (If it works though, happy to sign up)<br /><br />I&#039;ll probably get a bad reception to this, sorry.

				It depends, what are you good at?&nbsp; You could incorporate whatever you are going to school for into a website that can generate funds.&nbsp; The great thing about computers is that everything you want to learn is right in front of you, no books or expensive teachers needed.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to give suggestions without asking too many questions you don&#039;t want answered on the deepnet.&nbsp;

				There is always jobs to be had, you just need to look around some more.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying you haven&#039;t tried, but if you are looking for a consistent income working at a local store would be the way to go.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you are any good with backtrack, I have been looking at Cryptovirology but never done anything with it.

				There really is no jobs in in Ireland, ask anybody Irish about the financial state our country is in. People outside don&#039;t even realize. I am doing the equivalent of &#039;High School&#039; atm.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really that good at anything with computers. I know a lot more then the average person but nothing really technical. I was hoping along the lines of something &#039;auto-pilot&#039; but I will do work if I have to.<br /><br />

				Auto pilot you say?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how things work in Ireland but you could always dictate records for professionals.&nbsp; That&#039;s about as auto pilot as it gets...

				Don&#039;t think that&#039;s possible over here, but thank you.<br /><br />blockrockinbeats - I&#039;ll look into AMT, but not Swagbucks. Looking for money via paypal if possible.<br /><br />Thanks guys.
