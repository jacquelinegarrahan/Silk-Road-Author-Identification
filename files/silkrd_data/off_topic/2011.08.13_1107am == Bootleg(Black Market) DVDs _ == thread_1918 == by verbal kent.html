				Is there a demand for Bootleg(Black Market) DVD&#039;s ? Was just something that came to my mind. I know people can&#039;t get these as easily as others. But I can get the latest releases of movies rather cheap. I may be wasting my time asking, because there are sites where you can just stream them online. But a close mouth don&#039;t get fed.<br /><br />But let me know if there is an demand for this. And if so, I could setup a sellers account and start pumping.<br /><br />Also, on a side note, are there 2 many coke vendors around ? Cause I get good quality for a nice price. Also can cook crack, so I can offer that also, if there is room for new sellers.

				dont think there will be much call for dvds to be honest, if you found SR chances are you know how to get pirate media too, if it wasnt the case i could literally provide almost anything, software, games, movies, tv series whatever, i may be reasonably new to the net drugs scene but ive been online and pilfering my media since the days when we had to use irc and usenet and random ftp servers for the job and theres nothing i cant find.<br /><br />actually i lie, theres one thing i cant find and id pay a small fortune for should anyone be able to ever get it, a japanese show called denpa shonen, if you thought &quot;endurance&quot; (or Za Gaman correctly) was rough you aint seen nothing. the first season comprised of a man being locked in an apartment with only magazines and post cards, he had to live of what he could win from the magazines until he won 1 million yen worth of stuff, he never won clothes and was naked for almost an entire year it took him to finally win. i searched for it ever since it first came out and a few years ago hulu had it subtitled but i had to access through a proxy being non us so it was very slow and i couldnt cap it before they took it down, it was however possibly the most awesome and epic thing ever committed to film, if you havent heard of it before look it up, you can read about it in many places, then weep because you cannot watch it anywhere at all

				I agree with the fact that movies that you can get free on the internet won&#039;t have much market, but I personally have a HUGE collection of concert DVDs, and DVDs that have been converted from Laserdisc to DVD, ALL of which are not available on the internet, at least not for downloading...<br /><br />If you happen to be interested in LIVE Hendrix, Zeppelin, Stones, Van Halen, Elton John, Pink Floyd, Beatles, AC/DC(Bon Scott era), Neil Young, Alice Cooper, and Fleetwood Mac, to name a few...<br /><br />I have some of these already listed and am working on getting pics of the DVD cases scanned and getting more listed.<br />Check out my products:&nbsp; seller name:&nbsp; BTCpal
