				So gentlemen, we have almost ideal anonymity using Tor, and Bitcoin is a perfect currency. You&#039;ve seen first hand what can happen when a good coder or two get together and use these technologies (Silk road anyone?) What other services would you like to see on Tor? I&#039;m bored and I need a new project. Post an interesting idea and might just happen.

				Might as well post your ideas if you&#039;re not going to implement them (or can&#039;t.) Ideas alone are worthless without action. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I could always do with some kind of private storage account on Tor. For all the securities of TrueCrypt etc, it&#039;s just one layer on security and also convenience. I store my PGP keys on the memory stick, also Tor etc. I&#039;d like a private notepad I could only access through Tor where I can write down info and store files encrypted so even you couldn&#039;t read them (of course, I&#039;d PGP encrypt it myself before uploading). Just so if I lose my memory stick, keys etc, I can at least get all my info files back as I encrypted everything with 2 of my keys which I keep on different USBs incase I do lose one. Also, if TrueCrypt is cracked in any way or they get access to it, at least the details and contacts of people I work with aren&#039;t on there.<br /><br />Probably do a very small monthly fee sort of thing (by small, I mean like $1/month) and I&#039;d use it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Interesting idea. There&#039;s plenty of places to host websites on Tor but I don&#039;t know of any doing professional and secure storage. Wouldn&#039;t be hard to implement, either.

				Very true guys, I was only taking the piss anyway ;)<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to see what kind of stuff can be done on Tor. I&#039;m sure SR etc is only the tip of the ice-berg :)<br /><br />Sadly, I have no ideas, only to endorse StExo&#039;s ones!

				A Tor cloud storage would be cool. A service where you host encrypted volumes with people&#039;s data, so they don&#039;t have to be stored locally. Don&#039;t do a monthly fee, but instead a small one-time fee of 0.1BTC per MB or something.<br /><br />It would also be cool to see more anonymous markets. This would take some pressure of SR (both the number of users and LE attention) and it would make the deep net economy even harder to break down.

What exactly would you need to store on Tor that you couldn&#039;t to 100x better using the clearnet?&nbsp; <br /><br />My idea: a &quot;better&quot; version of the Silk Road where you actively implement ideas suggested by the userbase and where you charge a fraction of the price for your service fees. If there&#039;s enough movement here for DPR to make $2+ million a year, there&#039;s enough of an incentive for others to follow suit and compete with him. And best of all, if this site does get shut down for whatever reason, you&#039;ve got a head start on picking up where it left off. (The BlackMarket Reloaded is an attempt at this concept, but it too has it faults.) <br /><br />Other than that, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a whole lot of opportunities to make money using Tor, at least ones that would interest you. Arms dealing simply isn&#039;t popular enough at this stage of the game to justify a market for it (what kind of computer nerd needs an unlicensed AK-47?!) as are other niche services like hit men. Perhaps there&#039;s a market for a Silk Road-like site specializing in the distribution of child pornography, but it would take someone with both very low moral guidelines and extremely high technical skills to set it up. And if a site like this gained any momentum, you could expect 10x more scrutiny by LE and the media. Not worth it.<br />

				What about the ultimate underground hacking forum service??.<br />I have in mind something similar to Cyber tech help forums, but for hackers and people who want to learn, teach or hire someone for a job.<br />It could include an escrow service for bitcoin if hackers wanted to do some &quot;live&quot; teaching via some kind of irc messaging/chat service.<br />As far as i understand, there are some awesome hackers/technical minded people here on the deep web, and having a place where we could all get together, learn and share, even if its for money, which i dont see is a problem, doesnt currently exist, or if it does, its not regularly updated.<br />What are your thoughts on this, people??

All in a securely encrypted volume of course.<br /><br />The advantage of a hidden service is that you can store your files there, without the ISP knowing where they&#039;re located. Law enforcement would not be able to demand the service to hand over the documents, and require you to hand over the passwords under key disclosure law. Then you have a backup in case you have to wipe all your disk in an emergency, or you can access them from anywhere in the world if you somehow lose or abandon your computer.

				Ummm, dd you read my post??<br />I dont want any fancy pages just a place dedicated to chat and discussion, in a direct way which is better for everyone.<br />None of this hack this site crap, if you want that fine go look it up.<br />I am talking about a place for people to just literally gather and chat.

				I like the idea. I can think of times where it would be useful to contact a group of hackers, and pay them to attack a website for you. (I have some enemies that I wouldn&#039;t mind getting DDoS&#039;d)<br /><br />However, hackers are tech-savvy people. I bet that if they want to offer their services, they set up a Tor service or website themselves. You can&#039;t just determine what their hangout will be. And because the basics of the hacking skill are just understanding software and programming, learning to hack can be done just fine using clearweb resources.<br /><br />Still it&#039;s a nice idea. Check the hidden wiki to see if something like it already exists. We have the security subforum here, but something more dedicated wouldn&#039;t hurt. If it doesn&#039;t exist, and you set up a nice forum, then people will gather there. If things take off then maybe you get beautiful results.
