				Good News Everyone!<br /><br />There&#039;s a forum member by the name of Oscarzululondon that allegedly is able to create auditable degrees in any major from most Ivy League and even Lesser Universities from U.K. and U.S. such as Cambridge, Oxford, M.I.T, Harvard, etc. This means you get put into the school&#039;s record system as actually having taken exams, specific classes, the grades you got in them etc.<br /><br />Problem is, the only review he&#039;s received thus far is from &quot;Mojoman&quot;, but the testimony isn&#039;t viable enough for most of the others interested to go upon. <br /><br />If you&#039;d like to help your fellow community members or even if this sounds like something that you&#039;d be interested in investing, please contact me. I already have two members with me. We may have an amazing thing here, please lend us your support.<br /><br />-Cap<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Alright then everybody, I&#039;m gonna go ahead and take hold of my group sample idea. Since there are an amazing amount of members interested in this, and hopefully I&#039;m trusted enough by other members of the forum to write this review (As I&#039;ve done scores of times before), this is what I plan to do:<br /><br />I need 9 other members who want a stake in this and really want to test this out, perhaps leading to an amazing opportunity for hundreds on this website:<br /><br />1. Message me saying you want in, or I&#039;ll message you since you&#039;ve already posted here<br /><br />2. Screenshots and conversations will be recorded for any contact/transaction I have with both OZ and you.<br /><br />3. The price from the lesser universities amounts to nearly 50 BTC so we&#039;re dividing it into 10; which means each of the 9 investors will send 5 BTC to me on SR, the transactions of which will also be recorded. This way if it reveals to be a scam, then at least we only lose 5 BTC.<br /><br />4. I&#039;ll keep everyone updated every step of the way, every phone conversation, anything I receive in the mail.<br /><br />5. Upon my receiving the Degree, and given that it&#039;s audited, I&#039;ll release the good news to my fellow roaders and the 9 investors receive their bitcoins back.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to put the list of investors here as well, for everyone to see.<br /><br />1. Caparino<br />2. Delta11<br />3. steelseth<br />4. peek<br />5. Shroomeister<br />6. Ether<br />7.<br />8.<br />9.<br />10.<br /><br />Message me if you&#039;re interested, we might have an amazing thing here!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Great idea.

				Yea googleyed, people are kinda running away with this, hes had 2 people verify it, both &quot;people&quot; are accounts that were made shortly after the thread went up, he also said that it takes about 2 weeks to get everything in the mail, and he will be closing shop in....2 weeks...-.- so people who choose to invest please realize YOU WILL GET ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF THIS, if it is real, you will get your money back....if its not, then you lose it....if it is real you WONT EVEN BE ABLE TO BUY YOUR OWN ANYWAYS.<br /><br />oh and to add on top of that, he has apparently had offers for $20k to do this service, but turned them down and instead only wanted ~$1K because he doesnt need the money, because he has a well paying job

				Instead of being critical of anything, FE COULD just have seen whether or not we could have gotten our review in. BUT NO, instead of watching us proceed when we CLEARLY know the risks involved, he has to post stuff we already know to prevent any further investments. THIS WAY, NOT ONLY DO WE NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET THIS TRIAL DONE, WE NEVER EVEN FIND OUT IF HE&#039;S COMPLETELY LEGIT. YAY! Adderall? Yeah, you probably require adderall because of the dumb shit you are and your lack of understanding about its adverse long term effects.<br /><br />THANKS FUCKFACE, YOU PROBABLY MIGHT&#039;VE RUINED TEN PEOPLE&#039;S CHANCES FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

				Man, if this is for real we could all get a sick mega paid job and buy as many drugs off SR as we saw fit!! lol <br /><br />I have read a good few of Oscar&#039;s posts and does seem very tech savvy and I&#039;m guessing that is all ya gonna need to be able to procure these documents and access to Uni/College databases, so I&#039;m guessing his contacts must also be pretty heavy into tech too..<br /><br />I would be very interested to see if this could be done and good luck to you Cap....50 BTC for a brand new opportunity in life is an extremely small price to pay!!!<br /><br />All depends if its &#039;on the level&#039; and holds up to checks or reference requests.<br /><br />No BTC spare mate but I may consider it soon if ya still looking for people to go in when I&#039;m ready with some.

				DUDE I KNOW! If ANYTHING, everyone on this website that&#039;s working a deadend job or just finishing up that college degree and can&#039;t stand it can just get a Bachelor&#039;s in Computer Science and EASILY get an entry level IT job that pays $30,000+ starting.

				Yes, I know it seems sketchy but our goal is to either confirm him as legitimate or as a scammer and this&#039;ll help us do it faster.<br /><br />Two more people as two our brothers have their BTC tied up with intersango/other issues. Get at me ASAP so we can get this show on the road!<br /><br /><br />1. Message me saying you want in, or I&#039;ll message you since you&#039;ve already posted here<br /><br />2. Screenshots and conversations will be recorded for any contact/transaction I have with both OZ and you.<br /><br />3. The price from the lesser universities amounts to nearly 50 BTC so we&#039;re dividing it into 10; which means each of the 9 investors will send 5 BTC to me on SR, the transactions of which will also be recorded. This way if it reveals to be a scam, then at least we only lose 5 BTC.<br /><br />4. I&#039;ll keep everyone updated every step of the way, every phone conversation, anything I receive in the mail.<br /><br />5. Upon my receiving the Degree, and given that it&#039;s audited, I&#039;ll release the good news to my fellow roaders and the 9 investors receive their bitcoins back.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m going to put the list of investors here as well, for everyone to see.<br /><br />1. Caparino<br />2. Delta11<br />x3. steelseth (Is having trouble acquiring BTC from Intersango)<br />4. peek<br />5. novakane<br />6. Ether<br />7. ShutupMEG<br />8. hoffa<br />9. YouWillNeverKnow(Waiting on funds)<br /><br />Message me if you&#039;re interested, we might have an amazing thing here!<br /><br />Edit: I&#039;ll maintain my efforts to keep this post on the last page so it&#039;s viewed more.
