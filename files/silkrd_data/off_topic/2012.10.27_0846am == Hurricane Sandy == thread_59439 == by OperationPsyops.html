				&nbsp;;)<br />Just thought I&#039;d mention the hurricane / tropical storm that will be hitting the east coast, as I&#039;m sure every single person in the US has heard about already over 1,000 times but...the vendors in its path will have delayed shipping, probably for several days, at least. There will likely be delays from the postal service, as well. <br /><br />Personally, I&#039;m going in vacation mode because it would sure suck to be w/o power for days+ and come back to SR to have angry messages&nbsp; :o I&#039;ll pass on that&nbsp; ;D <br />What are other vendors on the east coast going to do? Millions of people in its path so it will affect SR, without a doubt.

In my location, you don&#039;t get arrested for having a blunt or two or three&#039;s worth of bud. Not sure what would happen to the driver though, so you bring up a good point.<br /><br />Blunt rides are fun anyway. In my area it&#039;s fairly safe to go on one. Plus, it&#039;s not like we fish bowl the damn car (ok... sometimes we do) and bump the music up to make it obvious.<br /><br />This is a special occasion. Sandy has challenged me, so I&#039;m going to go on a blunt ride. Ya dig?<br /><br />On a serious note, almost all of my smoking sessions go on inside a home or an area where the risk is low.

				Apologies in advance to our god fearin&#039;, global warming denying cousins from the US of A, but it strikes me as poetic justice that you guys are gonna get the worst of the freakish weather that your oil fuelled, excessive lifestyles have helped bring about.<br /><br />I hear hurricane Sheila is heading your way from Australia as well.....
