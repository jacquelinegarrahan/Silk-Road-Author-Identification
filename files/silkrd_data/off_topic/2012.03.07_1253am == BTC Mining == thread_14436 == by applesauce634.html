				I just had an idea about bit coin mining, but I would have a little trouble actually implementing it. <br />You go to a store (like Best Buy) and there&#039;s computers with internet access EVERYWHERE. <br />Using them for Bitcoin Mining sounds like an amazing idea; I just need a way to make the program run like a ghost (running in the bottom right task bar could possibly work too, they would just have to instantly go there) and I would need a way to make it start, login to the correct account, and begin mining right away.<br /><br />And since we&#039;re on the topic, what do you use to mine? I use bitcoin.cz with GUIMiner. I haven&#039;t looked around too much so there&#039;s probably better options out there. <br /><br />Cheers

				Well, ideally you&#039;d want one that runs without a GUI - guiminer kind of gives that away XD<br /><br />cgminer can be run in a command prompt, and you can pass it the right parameters - (pool, login) through the startup, (for example, I have a .bat file I wrote that automatically runs it with all the right settings)<br /><br />Modify that a little more to hide the console, and you&#039;re golden.

				It&#039;s so funny you should say this!&nbsp; My close friend and I actually went to best buy, got on the two best gpa/cpa systems that they had for &#039;test drive&#039;, and downloaded the gui miner that we use at our homes.&nbsp; We keyed in all the right commands, it started up, and.. apparently Best Buy or their internet network will not allow the solving of algorythyms via a video card!&nbsp; The gui program we use just kept repeating &#039;port not found&#039; or something like &#039;unable to run at this time&#039; or something!&nbsp; How crazy that you thought about what I actually tested, and believe me, it doesn&#039;t work at best buy!&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe somewhere else, but I can&#039;t be certain.&nbsp; We use phoenix, and you have to be real exact when it comes to commands and such, and well we just don&#039;t make that many mistakes.&nbsp; We also use bitcoin.cz, but if you ever get a super new nd super great video card, go to deepbit.net , I hear good things.<br /><br />Oh, and the AMD 5830 seems to be the highest per cost GPA out there.<br /><br />!

				its been done many times before, we call it a botnet, there are even a few miners who have infected their entire offices with trojans so they have many systems cpu mining when the offices are closed. the most common miner used for trojan botnet mining is ufasoft since its very small, needs minimal configuration and can be hidden fairly easily, at one time someone on here was selling a trojan for just that. ive also heard about others who have set it up to use only a certain percentage of cpu power so that the average user wont notice that their machine is mining away for someone else while theyre using it. <br /><br />on the subject of mining software ive used several in my time, im using a 5850 and a 5970 and it seemed that phoenix 1 with phatk was the fastest, cgminer had the best features but was a little slower and somewhere in between those on speed is diablominer which im currently using as so far its proven to be the most stable option (cgminer is pretty much as stable but slightly slower) this is all with 11.7 drivers on, i did mess with the drivers not too long ago trying to squeeze a bit extra out of it, i failed and went back to 11.7 but ive ended up messing it up a bit and now pheonix wont mine well at all for some reason, it used to get about 415MH per gpu but for some reason its dropped to 250-300, i really should format it and reinstall everything but that means not mining for a few hours while i get it all reinstalled, i hate downtime and as diablo has been so stable i havent bothered for what will be a less than 100MH/s increase from using pheonix, but its also a while since ive updated the miners so they may have improved a little since i updated last.<br /><br />@freefyte1<br /><br />i think the 5850 just trumps it as they tend to clock slightly better but in all honesty if you can get a voltage unlocked card then pretty much any of the 5xxx series are the golden mining cards, good luck finding one for a reasonable price now though, i got mine just before the BTC hit the big time, i paid £99 for it, a few weeks later when id convinced a friend to mine they had gone up to £140 and finally stopped at £180!<br /><br />and dont go to deepbit, they charge a fortune in fees and certainly arent the best pool out there, i was using arsbitcoin but it kind of fell apart when they fell into negative smpps buffer but there are plenty of other good pools who wont rape you on fees like bitcoins.lc, btcguild, abcpool and a few others, they may not all be totally fee free but theyll be less than deepbit any day of the week. also its a problem if one pool controls over 50% of the total network mining power and deepbit has come scarily close to that a few times.<br /><br />out of interest how have you got your pheonix and card setup? if you havent already id suggest dropping the memory to 300MHz and adding the flags &quot;-k phatk VECTORS BFI_INT WORKSIZE=256 AGGRESSION=13 FASTLOOPS=false&quot; that seemed to give me best speeds and if im honest it was slightly faster running the 10.10 drivers with sdk 2.1 but that may have changed with recent alterations to the phatk kernel

				And you wouldn&#039;t feel bad about racking up somebody else&#039;s electricity bill without their consent for your own profit? Not to judge you or anything, but I personally can&#039;t imagine feeling too good about myself doing that. What do you guys think? How is this different from just stealing a person&#039;s wallet for example?

				^ Free drugs, exactly.<br /><br />And you&#039;re not really racking up electricity bills. With the method I&#039;ll be using it will only go when the computers would already be on. What they don&#039;t know won&#039;t hurt them ;p And hey, I&#039;m poor and in the mood for some DMT xD

				Alright alright, back again!&nbsp; So.. yes &#039;&#039;stealing&#039;&#039; electricity is not what bit mining is.. it is the solving of algorithmic calculations via a personal pc, through a software setup, using your own cpu.&nbsp; Plain and simple (yet I never thought about it being like a sort of crime until you mentioned it, but hey, we ARE revolutionaries, right?!).<br /><br />Also, profspudhed:<br />You&#039;re right about the 5xxx series!&nbsp; I can&#039;t wait to get one!&nbsp; I&#039;m running -k poclbm device=0 vectors bfi_int worksize=256 aggression=10 fastloop=on ... and thanks for the tip on deepbit!!&nbsp; I also read that somewhere before I think.&nbsp; Also, I have an AMD Radeon HD 6320, which is not that great right now.&nbsp; Can you give me any tips on amping up my card or my phoenix arguments?&nbsp; <br /><br />Ok: kushberry:<br />Yes, you are getting free btc, hence, free drugs, HOWEVER, do you know how long it actually takes to mine one whole bitcoin b y mining on&nbsp; personal computer?&nbsp; Lol, a long long time.&nbsp; Like nearly a month!&nbsp; With a basic HP or Dell!<br /><br />applesauce634:<br />you are awesome, keep doing the mining and researching and Great minds think alike!

				im not as familiar with 6xxx series cards but most all radeon cards benefit from using -k phatk rather than poclbm, if you have your card overclocked and memory clocked down to 300MH then up your aggression to 12 or 13 and turn fastloops off, oh and make sure youre running the older drivers package (i use 11.7) and sdk 2.5 if youre using newer drivers with the 2.6 sdk then youll need to clock your memory up rather than down and then drop the worksize to 64. thats about all i can think of as far as optimizing your pheonix line, for any more speed than that youre going to have to push your clocks up.&nbsp; <br /><br />on that subject if you havent yet got your 5xxx series card be careful when buying, some cant have their voltage increased so it limits your ability to overclock the card (i know many of the xfx cards suffered this problem) some of them can have the bios flashed to allow overvolt but its best to get a card that does it without a mod if you can
