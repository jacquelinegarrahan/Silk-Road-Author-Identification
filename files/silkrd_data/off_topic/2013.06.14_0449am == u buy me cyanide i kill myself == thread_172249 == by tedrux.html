				trying to keep it as simple as possible.

				Also I have no problem webcasting the event if you&#039;d like to purchase tickets. as soon as the cyanide and webcam are in hand (i dont own a webcam) then I will be glad to let you watch. it will make no difference to me.

				I&#039;m not here to judge. I am here to accomplish a goal of getting cyanide to commit suicide. If I can entice an audience by webcasting it , okay. If I do not need to by getting some one to buy it for me, okay. either way my goal is accomplished. will you purchase one gram of cyanide for me from emeralds shop on the silk road and send it to fuckingACE to relay to me?

				I would rather buy you a gram of LSD crystal so you can be on it forever, and really think about life deep. I think life is too precious to just throw away man, so I couldn&#039;t bring myself to knowingly kill someone. Even though it would cost me so much more. Cause your life is probably worth more that that, and with that amount of acid you&#039;re bound to come through with something path breaking. Da Vinci, Newton used Acid. Einstein was declared mentally retarded then he had a run in with Acid and used it for life. If you&#039;ve never tried it I&#039;d rather get you some of that. I think you&#039;ll appreciate life a lot more.<br /><br />Unless if it was some serious chronic pain, you&#039;re dead everyday anyway kind of medical condition. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not against euthanasia, I am against suicide and wasting life.

				huh,&nbsp; what? <br />I believe in right of choice, but please consult me before saying I´ll agree to shit. <br />We offer a forwarding service no questions asked, its a client privileged to be forwarded whatever they want without being interrogated about the contents. Its what makes a free market in part. <br />but seeing as your use for the cyanide has been publicly declared, I´ll have to give the ethics on it a think. many things enter into it including your state of mind amongst other things. SO no I don´t agree to it until a. ive thought about it and b. you´ve spoken to someone about your issues. <br />ACE

				Also this is the second or third time you´ve publicly asked for donations in taking your own life, the first time people were offended and didn´t help, the second time poeple were sympathetic and didn´t help, putting that choice on someone isnt nice for them, and kinda inconsiderate for you. They wont help this time. I find it hard to believe that you havn´t been able to raise the listing amount yourself in over 3 months. I think you just want someone to talk to and this is your way of engaging people. <br />I suggest you find a less provocative method of doing so. <br />ACE

				it shouldnt be hard for you to beleive that I cant earn money and have no source of income. because I cant and dont. im extremelly frustrated- no one either beleives I want to die or understands what it means for every single breath to be against your will. I don&#039;t have any issues. I am of sound mind. I simply have too much intelligence, have thought about life and looked at people , looked at human existance and found it ugly. many have come before me and many will follow. but THIS SHIT shouldn&#039;t even be being discussed. keep it simple. i want cyanide. some one buy it for me. i dont want the bc. im not trying to rip some one off. i want cyanide , simple and strait. you dont have to know what I&#039;ll do with it . you don&#039;t have to chime in your two cents on if&nbsp; you think im a troll or need help. keep your oppinions to yourself (although, ace, I do respect yours) Its simply &#039;yes&#039; you&#039;ll help or nothing, just say yes or stay silent. im not looking to converse about it.

				So you are really asking people to donate you cyanide to kill yourself? <br />Do you understand you are asking someone you don&#039;t know to commit a murder? (yes, that&#039;s it, if the person doesn&#039;t know you s/he is just committing a murder by sending you cyanide knowing you will kill yourself with it, or even worse not being sure that YOU will use it on yourself the murder can be on someone else).<br /><br />I&#039;m all for self-liberty and self-responsibility on doing whatever people want with their life (either if I am philosophically against suicide, especially if the suicide is when things are going &quot;wrong&quot;), but just because of the &quot;responsibility&quot; part you cannot ask someone else to do the thing for you. I understand you don&#039;t have money but at this point you have nothing to lose right? If you really want cyanide I&#039;m sure you can find a way to find the money somewhere.<br /><br />Elsewhere just take a knife and slit your throat (or the femoral artery, nobody can save you after), ffs, or go to the roof of an high palace and jump from it. You don&#039;t need cyanide at all to kill yourself. It&#039;s very easy when you REALLY want to (either another tip: datura is very easy to find, eat more than 5 grams of seeds of that and you will die; if you have fear of pain in this way you will feel nothing, you will simply pass out and you will not wake up anymore, or you can do the same with hemlock or foxglove, all very easy to find - in nature - plants and very poisonous).<br /><br />So either take responsibility of what you are doing or if you are not sure about it explain your situation and work with someone to come outside of it. I think you are stuck in the middle right now, because, my friend, if you would really like to die, you would already have died now, it&#039;s futile you say it&#039;s not so (I know that perfectly). <br /><br />This or you want to let pass suicide for murder and even pretend someone to pay the way for you (your parents perhaps? are you so pathetic?); if that&#039;s the case you have very poor dignity, child, work on that instead on killing someone else.

				I didn&#039;t want to be offensive, but seriously, how can one be SURE that this guy, just as a single example, isn&#039;t a child that wants to kill his parents and to do so he came up with the excuse that life sucks etc. to promote empathy and make people buy him some cyanide on the pretense of suicide, when the only thing he wants is to get his mom and papy money? (Why? Because the fact that there will be no proof anywhere that he did buy the poison will mean that he can come out of trouble; he would just need an alibi on top and he would be fine. It would not be the first time a thing as this happen; some years ago a woman killed her husband with a similar method and they could never find it was her, for example.)<br /><br />I find highly suspicious that if the guy was really so intent on suicide he couldn&#039;t find a way already in 3 months, and above all I&#039;m suspicious about the fact that he wants explicitly cyanide (and on top of that he wants somebody else to buy it for him, because supposedly he cannot acquire any money even if he has nothing at all to lose at this point) when there are many less &quot;exotic&quot; methods completely free and easier to do the same (it&#039;s only that they are much more difficult to use - for one reason or another - to kill someone else, what a coincidence...)<br /><br />This makes me think that there&#039;s something fishy about the issue. I really hope that it is just that the guy is passing a really bad moment and he doesn&#039;t really want to commit suicide but this is his personal way to attract attention and to talk about his depression. This is actually a good thing (the fact that he talks about this, even with this methodology), but given the topic and the modus operandi put forth you can never be too scrupulous and attentive about every possible implication on the issue.

				You should seriously consider what other people have posted here already about ingesting lsd or any psychedelic for that matter. I used to have this same exact thought, I looked every where for cyanide asking every drug dealer and gang banger I knew. Ended up dropping a shit ton of liquid lsd one day trying to over dose on it and well on that day realized there&#039;s no point in killing your self.<br /><br />Do your self a favor before you go and dive deep head first into the realm of psychedelics.

We cannot be sure one way or another (on his favor it is the point that if he wanted free drugs he would not have asked for cyanide to begin with) so we have nothing to lose really on helping him if that&#039;s the case.<br /><br />So I&#039;m perfectly willing to pass the hat to acquire the money to buy him Ayahuasca to try to give him a better prospective about his life and become interested in it once more. I have nothing to lose on doing this (money comes and goes, what sharing a little amount will change?) and if I can help a person in trouble I&#039;m all for it.<br /><br />This is much better than sending him cyanide or any other substance to kill himself (or even worse another). If he approach Ayahuasca in the correct way I&#039;m sure he will change prospective about the sadness of life in general and on him having no place in it. It will turn his approach from the one of a slave to the one of a participant.<br /><br />So please, if somebody wants to help the guy out let&#039;s collect enough money to send him Ayahuasca; I will then give him personally explanations on how to use it in the best way to really change his perspective on life and stop with this nonsense about suicide (that doesn&#039;t change anything anyway, even if he can think so).

				Sorry, but gotta call bullshit on this. <br /><br />Like mentioned numerous times above, if you really wanted to kill yourself, you dont need the assistance of SR and cyanide to help you achieve your goal. Hang yourself.&nbsp; Slit your wrists. Take numerous amounts of sleeping pills and alcohol. Jump off a roof. Jump in front of a truck.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless. <br /><br />Within the 3 months you have posted, you could have easily earned the money to buy it yourself. Unless you are either chained to a post or a parapalegic. You could earn 200 just panhandling. Dont have anything to sell or anyway to make money? Bullshit. <br /><br />Then you say you would broadcast it live? And sell tickets? GTFO. Sounds like your a narcassist thats getting their kicks off by telling random people on the internet that youre going to kill yourself. If you really wanted to, you wouldnt be on here threatening it over and over again. My guess is you&#039;re sitting there smiling after every comment thats posted that falls into your self-centered online sympathy game you&#039;re playing. <br /><br />If you want to kill yourself, then fucking do it. Its not that hard, and honestly, I could care less.&nbsp; People kill themselves every day for situations that are much worse than the excuses you are giving. If you are that weak of a person thats all boo-hoo, poor me, my life sucks and I cant take it anymore,&nbsp; then you would probably be doing the human race a favor. <br /><br />Either stop being a pussy and do it, or buck the fuck up, be a man and realize that life sucks and its hard and difficult, realize you have a set of balls hanging between your legs, and handle your shit. No one is responsible or can fix any of your actions, decisions, problems, issues, etc. <br /><br />Shit or get off the pot.

				I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s really bullshit, suicidal persons are very depressed so obviously they&#039;re not motivated enough to get a job and raising $200 seems like something way harder than it really is for them. When you&#039;re that hopeless you usually won&#039;t put that much effort into killing yourself, you won&#039;t put much effort into anything. I&#039;m pretty sure that he&#039;s just depressed and maybe not as suicidal as he says he is but it&#039;s probably just a call for help.

It&#039;s far more effective to put your wallet address and say you need to pay for forums maintenance or else they&#039;ll get shut down by the DEA or some bullshit story like that... He would&#039;ve chosen another approach after 3 months of failure if it was a scam. It&#039;s just for attention or trolling that he started those threads.

				thank you TB. your being sweet. sweet and genuine are a hard comboniation to affirm. I&#039;d rather try to disbeleive so i dont get hurt later. but what the fuck is genuine anyways? #onlyconstantischange . <br />I&#039;ll try your idea<br /><br />and to dude who asked how much tix are; they cost as much as a lethal dose of barbituates and alchohol and a webcam. you and who ever else is interested go ahead and figure out how to split the price and I don&#039;t want the BC just the tools i need directly.&nbsp; <br />liil. if I had gotton a stronger response I probably would have done it for profit just to cover funeral expenses. but fuck it. idk how butit&#039;ll get sorted out. broke people die too. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172249.msg1245778#msg1245778">Quote from: TrashBox on June 17, 2013, 05:41 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">tredruxxxx sorry the job hunt isn&#039;t going well&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I&#039;ve said it to you before in PM but since you are going public on this I hope you don&#039;t mind if i say it here, too... you are funny. you hold nothing back and you&#039;re honest and some of what you say is pretty fucked up but that&#039;s the kind of shit i like to read about :) start a thread with some of your stories and ask for donations to your sr buyer account. i bet you could make some money that way...<br /><br />have you ever done mdma?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
