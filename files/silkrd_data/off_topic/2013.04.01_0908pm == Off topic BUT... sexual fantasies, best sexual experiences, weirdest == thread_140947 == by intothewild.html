				One of my girls has me tie her up tight and choke her with my complete domination. I&#039;m not so in to it, but I do make her feel good by doing what she likes.<br /><br />My fantasy is to meet one of the lovely ladies of SR and fuck there brains out.<br /><br />The reason is because around where I live there aren&#039;t any druggie women. My girlfriends all put up with it, but they don&#039;t like it. The girls on SR have there third eye open which is what gets me going. Having an intelligent women.

				Well it can compromise your anonimity because having really weird sexual fantasies kind of makes you unique to the rest of the population, so someone could find you by searching for people having the same fantasies. But unless your fantasy is really really weird, it doesn&#039;t really compromise your anonimity. Yours wouldn&#039;t compromise it, for example.<br /><br />Back on topic, I agree with you, this discussion is more interesting! I don&#039;t have any fantasies out of the ordinary though..

				I get an erection to really awesome C++ code and want to lovingly suck the dick or vagoo of whoever made it. Some shrinks say it&#039;s basically objectaphilia but the human projection is too much.

				Jeese, pretty tame in here today.&nbsp; You&#039;d think drugs would expand your imagination peeps! <br /><br />I fantasize about a hot naughty librarian chick who drops to her knees and undoes my pants.&nbsp; I look down at her as she looks up with those puppy dog eyes, she nods yes ; it&#039;s time. <br /><br />She yanks out my cock and strokes it slowly while she licks her lips. She takes it in and let&#039;s her drool drip down her chin with my cock sliding in and out of her tiny mouth. Her lipstick begins to smear around her lips and she sucks it in and out while cupping my balls.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looking down at her, I see she is hungry for my hot cock inside her.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to stop because it feels so good.&nbsp; Her hot mouth goes all the way down my shaft to my balls.&nbsp; <br /><br />She gets up and raises her black skirt up and slips down her underwear and tights down to her ankles&nbsp; she bends over the table&nbsp; and raises her ass up in the air.&nbsp; She strokes her pussy a few times and takes a lick and sniff of her own spices. I nearly cum as I stand there watching.&nbsp; <br /><br />I walk up and slider cock inside her wet clit&nbsp; it&#039;s a little tight, so I have to part her ass checks open a bit. Her juice begins to shine around her hole.&nbsp; &nbsp;I slip it in deeper as she lets out a loud moan.&nbsp; I begin to drive it in her deep over and over again. I grab her hair from behind and yank as I smash my cock inside her.&nbsp; She yells, &quot;yes!&quot; &quot;Deeper&#039;. I begin to cum so I pull out and turn her around and grab her beautiful face.&nbsp; I make her go on her knees as I stroke my cock in her face. She licks the tip as I stroke harder.&nbsp; She opens her mouth and whimpers for it.&nbsp; I let out a loud moan as I fire my cum into her open mouth. She swallows my load and smiles up at me. <br /><br />That&#039;s how yu write a sex story peeps!<br />
