				Just curious about that to see how strong the friendships on here can become? I feel like there are a few vendors I&#039;d def be cool for meeting up IRL, I guess they could be total assholes, but I think you can get a decent idea of how much you&#039;d relate IRL from they way they come across here.<br />What do you think?

				the whole point of an online anonymous global drug market is that its anonymous!<br /><br />just because you have conversations with people through text and messages has got nothing to do with how you get on in RL. human chemistry dictates this also.

There are plenty of people here I would love to go for a drink with IRL and I even go as far as to say it&#039;s a shame that it is this way but that&#039;s just how it is. There is no way I&#039;d meet up with anyone face to face and anyone who would contemplate doing so is extremely naive.

				I&#039;d like to attend a Silk Road conference, lol... pretty sure the afterparty would be bangin... or full of pigs... but nah, I&#039;d never meet anyone, especially if I was a vendor. Maybe one day we can all meet up without fascists wanting to crack our skulls with batons, I can dream.

				I&#039;m with Limetless. There is zero chance I would meet anyone from TSR no matter how much I trusted them. There is a lot more risk involved when you are a vendor. I can&#039;t imagine how anybody in their right mind, selling illegal goods/services on TSR, would meet an anonymous stranger unless for very good reasons. I would be immediately suspicious of ANYONE who would be so stupid to suggest it in the first place.

				i wouldn&#039;t unless I was 100% sure the dude wasn&#039;t LE or anything sketchy. And they&#039;d have to live within an hour from me, i&#039;m not driving that fuckin&#039; far to meet with some random dude, I have enough friends that live within 20 minutes of me.<br /><br />I think everyone should have enough intuition to be able to tell whether someone is a real person or some sketchy dude trying to fuck you over.

				Google &quot;Zoklet,&quot; it&#039;s... a lot of shit. There&#039;s some okay information in some of the more serious subsections involving chemistry, and there&#039;s a few shreds of good information under the mountains of crap in the Bad Ideas forum. There are some decent counterfeiters over there. But it&#039;s mainly wannabe criminals flaming each other. Makes me feel good about myself.

				IT&#039;S NOT FUCKING RELISH. IT&#039;S FUCKING BRANSTON PICKLE. Jesus fucking Christ. <br /><br />And I&#039;m gunna be honest and perhaps a little controversial and say I am not really fussed about housing or feeding the homeless and I especially not at 5 to 6 in the morning when I am tired. <br /><br />And we weren&#039;t defeated either, we saw it was the end of the era and decided to end it on a high note and passed the torch to you. We gave you common law, your ideas on civil liberties, secularism and all that and then we needed a fuckin break after World War II. We just didn&#039;t realize you&#039;d go off the rails and turn into a little crack whore and do things like Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs and then make up some shit about WMDs and all the other crazy shit you do. Now given that we have to get our Queen to ring up your President or whoever the real President&#039;s best mate is at the time (because there is no way the Queen ever talked to Bush on the phone, he&#039;d have just fucked it up by asking what kind of tea she sprinkles on her waffles in the morning or some ridiculous shit like that) and tell you guys to calm the fuck down. Take Clinton banging Monica Lewinsky for example, it probably goes a little something like this -<br /><br />America does something stupid <br /><br />Prince Philip sees the news report on the TV and then walks into Liz while she is combing the Corgis fur - &quot;Errrr Liz, William Clinton is having sex with some woman and lying about it. You better take a look at this.&quot; <br /><br />Queen - &quot;Is she at least good looking enough to be having sex with the leader of the free world.&quot;<br /><br />Prince Philip - &quot;No, I am afraid she is not. Unfortunately she is a disgusting and rather rotund looking whore with a double chin that you will be able to eat your dinner of. She looks a bit similar Rosanne from that sitcom Rosanne&quot; <br /><br />Queen - &quot;Oh dear, and we had such hope for William. What has happened so far?&quot;<br /><br />Prince Philip - &quot;Well he has decided to lie about it when it&#039;s quite obvious he did indeed shit his man porridge all over her tabloid hungry face&quot;<br /><br />Queen - &quot;Oh for FUCK sake even Mary the Changer of the royal chamber pot could handle a PR disaster better than this, in fact after I eat coronation chicken she frequently does!&quot; *picks up phone, calls Bill* &quot;William, just tell the truth because everyone will pity you for being stupid enough to have sex with a piece of cheese rather than lying about having sex with a piece of cheese because you enjoyed it! Sort it the fuck out!&quot;<br /><br />William - &quot;Well yes, but errr my domestic policy clearly states.....&quot;<br /><br />Queen - &quot;I DON&#039;T GIVE A ROYAL SHIT ABOUT YOUR DOMESTIC POLICY, JUST CALM THE FUCK DOWN AND SORT IT OUT! Also did you get the shortbread I sent you? It was from my Scottish castle. Anyway goodnight William, sweet dreams and stop dong coke and body shots before you select a whore to have sex with, it leads you to make bad decisions.&quot;<br /><br />See, that&#039;s how history REALLY happens. You just don&#039;t find this shit out because you don&#039;t read the British papers.<br />

				A little late to the party, I figured we had smart enough people on here that know not to take any chances, but it&#039;s interesting to meet so many like minded people and having to refrain from meeting up at a festival or something like that because they could be LE. It sucks actually cuz some of these people are probably pretty cool mofos, but better safe than sorry.

				The weird thing is we could never knowingly meet each other, but we could unknowingly be neighbors, friends or acquaintances IRL and NEVER know. Really quite weird if you think about it.<br />ALSO, don&#039;t knock the maple syrup + fried bacon combo until you tried it. I&#039;m british and the idea of it at first seemed absurd, until i tried it for myself. I have to say that shit tastes like heaven, just a small drop on each rasher of bacon when you&#039;re cooking it, really adds to the sweet, delicious bacon taste mmm-MM!

Why not just dip it in the yolks of your sunny side up eggs which are mandatory when eating bacon anyway?

				I have met one member at a music festival and he got sketched out and bounced after a brief discussion of the minds. He never said it directly but he said &quot;supertrips?&#039; and we both high fived and laughed then he was gone. I also met some others at festivals. No one has ever told me their username or if they are a seller but it always lights me up so much to see them because I know we must have A LOT in common. Not many people that can keep up with my drug speak. especially when I get into compound structures and their importance on potency and affect.

				I&#039;m quite sure meeting IRL would never happen anyway, but it&#039;s been interesting to see where people stand on this. Surprised no one told me to fuck off for even starting a thread with that title, but in retrospect at least you can get a good idea of how people think according to their answer. As I said, I love to meet some of the peeps I&#039;ve met here, as I&#039;m sure most people would in a perfect world, but until then it will never happen. Whatevs I don&#039;t really give a fuck, I was really bored &amp; sober when I started this thread so it&#039;s all good ;D

				Yes there are a handful of people here in the forums that I think would be a hoot in real life. Only one vendor I know of has an outstanding invite the the casa.

				he was actually a friend of a friend and we just slowly figured it out throughout the night. One of the meetings was sketchy as fuck. The first was at a festival and he kind of said he knew I was based on my knowledge but I never really said I was also a member.

				No I have never met anyone from this website not knowingly anyway. There are a lot of fine people here tho. The risk out weigh the need for it by a landslide. I would like to see the entire internet be anonymous. This market shows how it can be if people aint got their noses stuck up other people&#039;s asses

				Inevitably one day when the feds figure out SR and tor and somehow find out who all the users are, we will all meet in something like Guantanamo bay. <br />Gentleman, just get ready to take your cock meat sandwiches like a man.<br />
