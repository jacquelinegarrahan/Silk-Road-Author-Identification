				I have MDMA powder from from dirtysouf and 3Jane... which would you take? I&#039;m most interested in it being clean, followed by it being strong. Any recommendations on which I take?

				I&#039;ve had both.&nbsp; 3jane&#039;s is better in quality and pricing.&nbsp; Dirtysouf&#039;s wasn&#039;t bad but it was distinctly cut with baby laxatives (not saying it was vendor, most powdered drugs are cut and baby laxative is usually what they do it with).&nbsp; Epic shits for the whole day after a night of hitting dirtysouf&#039;s stuff.....

				I find MDA way better than mdma when it is legit.<br />It is a way better high no doubt more visually awesome and the feeling is just bliss .. You can sleep like a baby while the trip and even eat it impresses me as mdma is just as great but id prefer some dank MDA&nbsp; ;D

				Haven&#039;t had them both, but can vouch that 3Janes is real good. <br /><br />And I must agree with LSDank - MDA is far preferable, though sadly very hard to find. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				tried some of 3jane&#039;s stuff last night. First time I insufflated it, about 300-400mg over 2-hr period. It worked, but much shorter timeframe than my usual (ingestion) route. The drips were bitter though not too bad.

				Well might post some up soon once interest is higher.&nbsp; A description of this product; Looks almost like actual snow with lots of crystal glare all over. <br /><br />Feel free to let me know what you think, and can start putting up some pics for y&#039;all.
