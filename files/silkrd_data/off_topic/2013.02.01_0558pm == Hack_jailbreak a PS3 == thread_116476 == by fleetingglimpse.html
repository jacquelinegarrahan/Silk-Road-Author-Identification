				Iv just got a new PS3 slim after one of my old fats died :(<br /><br />Iv never really been interested in this, but out of curiosity id like to try and hack/jailbreak my other old fat. <br /><br />I swore id never buy another CoD after WaW but people are raving about BLOPS2. I like cod but am unwilling to part with the cash for a game i may hate &gt;:( .Or any other game<br /><br />Im on FW 4.31(i think) on the fat. Is there a way to jailbreak/hack this to play copied/downloaded BLOPS2 (or any other game) games from usb? Or burned disk i suppose. Preferably to get online?<br /><br />There is a bit of info out there, but some sounds like shite and others want cash or telephone numbers, to which i say GTF.<br /><br />Im asking here because i know there are are a lot of clever, knowledgeable dudes on here. Can you help me, in layman&#039;s terms please?<br /><br />Its all appreciated<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />fg

				I looked up what you can do with a hacked PS3 and couldn&#039;t find anything about playing gmaes off a usb etc so I gave up lol. But that was&nbsp; a year ago, so it might be better now. Heck, lemme know if you can, I&#039;d hack mine then haha. BTW, BLOPS2 is fantastic

				If I recall correctly you must have the OFW 4.30 or lower to JB, I dont own one and kept reading about the sony scene after I sold my psp because it was interesting. And yes in case you get it hacked you can load games from a USB harddrive<br />About playing online you might get banned but since your Firmware will be outdated I dont think you could do it in the first place<br />If you speak spanish google for ps3.scenebeta it is very complete and noob friendly.<br />An interesting thing that happened is that some months ago a hacker group said that they got the key and were able to sign their own homebrew and sony was doomed etc.. but i don&#039;t know how that ended lol.
