				Hit up CaptainMal on SR. If there is a bank of america near you, he&#039;ll give you his accnt info and you go up there and make a deposit into account like you would any other bank account. go home send him another PM on SR sayin you sent it, include your SR btc address, then just like that he&#039;ll send you the coins, taking his respectable fee per transaction. It depends on how much you deposit. works really nice though. way easier than bitinstant/online wallets.

What I&#039;ve heard recently about BitInstant is negative! Don&#039;t quote me because I&#039;ve never used their service, but they are easily the most popular way for US customers to get their BTC anonymously and fast. Other users should spread the light on whats going on with BI at the moment because recently I&#039;ve been hearing some mixed reviews.

				I have not had any problems using Bitinstant.&nbsp; The option of going straight to my wallet is really convenient, I get my bitcoins within 15 mins usually.&nbsp; Key points to remember is that you will not need an ID, but the info you enter online must match watch you use when you get to the store.&nbsp; I use my local walmart, its a different person every time and they&#039;re as clueless as could be.&nbsp; Nothing illegal about buying bitcoins, and its pretty difficult to trace where exactly bitcoins are going and to who their going to/from, especially when you&#039;re careful and toss them around a bit through e-wallets on tor.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				So if wanted to up security i would have a throw away e-mail that i only access though through open connections...obviously have a drop point with no drugs or paraphernalia at that specific locations...encrypt everything...and use fake info to purchase BTC&#039;s&nbsp; Am i missing any other precaution??? I know there is Liberté Linux you can use to access the tor network through memory alone, but that seems a little extreme for some weed and xanax lol.<br /><br />I&#039;d love to get some feedback on others&nbsp; beliefs...feel free to share!
