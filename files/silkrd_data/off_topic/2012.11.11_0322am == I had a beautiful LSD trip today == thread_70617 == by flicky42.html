				My birthday was about a week ago and I decided to spend today to myself and just contemplate my path in life. I don&#039;t have very many friends.. like at all and I&#039;ve really been trying to figure out why. I realize how little I understand about basic communication, my mind is always racing so fast anyone who knows me can tell. I spend all day just constantly thinking, which is probably why I do so well in my field. <br /><br />I love how psychedelics can slow my thoughts down and make me feel almost normal. I really wonder do you guys/girls look at people when you talk to them? I feel like I don&#039;t do this very often and I&#039;m not sure why it is. I also don&#039;t know how to invite someone to hang out. I feel like I always need to present them with something or do something to make me worth their time. These are basic things for most people but I guess I just spent so much time in my mind my whole life that I never developed externally.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The roads down so I can bullshit rant if I want too&nbsp; :o

The funny thing is I&#039;ve seemed to gotten rid of my trust issues thanks to the many life changes I&#039;ve made. The only problem is how the fuck do I ask people to hang out with me lol
