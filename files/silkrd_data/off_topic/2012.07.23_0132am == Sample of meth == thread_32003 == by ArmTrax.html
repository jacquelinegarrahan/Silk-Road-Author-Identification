				So, as long as the guy on here keeps his word (and I&#039;m not implying that he is not) I should have a sample of some crystal before too long.<br /><br />This will be my first introduction to the world of meth. I have had pharmaceutical amphetamines before, but never crystal meth. <br /><br />I know that meth can be smoked, poked, or snorted. <br /><br />I am a regular iv user of opiates, so the iv does not scare me, I just assume I would have to start off small and know nothing about shooting meth so perhaps it isn&#039;t a good idea, but I have an adventurous spirit. <br /><br />I imagine smoking is the most common, probably where the sensible person would start....<br /><br />And then snorting it... I&#039;ve also had plenty of experience snorting stuff, but something tells me meth would burn like a bitch, but only two ways to find out, try it or ask someone who knows...<br /><br />So how should I lose my meth cherry?

				have you ever injected any other type of amphetamines? it&#039;s not all that different, just meth has a bit of extra kick/edge. i really hate meth (though i&#039;ve done plenty enough of it in my time) so i&#039;m inclined to tell you to throw it away and never look back :( but if you must do it... there&#039;s only really one way, shoot it. &gt;.&gt;

				Only snorted it and smoked it.I personally only like it every once in awhile.I&#039;m the same I enjoy banging H.Stimulants aren&#039;t really my thing but I wouldn&#039;t recommend banging anything for the first time.You&#039;ll probably want to rail it.Id imagine its like H and railing it isnt anywhere near as powerful as shooting.So just to be safe I would say up the nose it goes.

				Don&#039;t do it man... Noose is right, you&#039;ll throw your life away. After 6 months of abuse, you&#039;ll spend 2 years of exercising and eating healthy just to become a shell of what you used to be<br /><br />Oh wait, you already shoot up heroin regularly&nbsp; ;D Go on then
