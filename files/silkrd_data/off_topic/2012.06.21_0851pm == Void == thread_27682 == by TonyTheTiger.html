				I don&#039;t like taking it because my eyes twitch a lot and i get mild headaches on the comedown. But I do use it now and then to get work done, and deal with the negatives later.

				I get work done like a champ. I&#039;m focused, and I can&#039;t stop talking.<br /><br />But then I end up staying awake for days on end, not being able to eat, then when I finally can eat the roof of my mouth burns.<br /><br />So sometimes I like it, but it&#039;s best not to let me have a big ass bottle of it...

				I take 15mg every weekday morning, none on the weekends. It makes work fly by, get a ton more shit done, I&#039;m very friendly to co-workers which if didn&#039;t take it then I&#039;m usually at work trying to do as very little as possible of actual work and trying to think of a good excuse to leave early.<br /><br />My only problem with it is sleeping at night, which a couple of bowls of weed fixes, and the rising cost / shortage.

				Sleeplessness I cure with a few bowls or a few beers before bed, I don&#039;t get headaches on it or eye twitches. I do bite my nails at an alarming rate on it, especially if I&#039;m having to listen to someone talk between my &quot;mhmm&#039;s&quot; which is code for hurry the hell up, it&#039;s my turn to talk.

If you&#039;re taking a bunch to abuse it then you&#039;ll have all the tell tale signs of someone on speed or tweaking out like a crack fiend.
