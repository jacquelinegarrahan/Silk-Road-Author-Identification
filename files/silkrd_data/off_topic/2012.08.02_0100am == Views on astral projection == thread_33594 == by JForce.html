				Recently found out about astral projection and I&#039;m intrigued by it but very skeptical as to whether it&#039;s complete bullshit or not.<br /><br />What are your views on it? I&#039;d love to hear them!<br /><br />For those who don&#039;t know what it is you can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection<br /><br />It&#039;s basically a spiritual practice which involves detaching yourself from your physical body and is seen as an out of body experience.

				Used to be heavily into the occult and I have tried Astral Projection several times. Even got some good books on it. <br /><br />Problem I have is the same problem with remote viewing/sensing: Interpreting your experience.<br /><br />Did you actually leave your body or did you just go so deep into relaxation that you entered hypnogogic state? I would like to try a semi scientific study of this. Maybe have a forum member place an envelope with a random object or picture in it, somewhere around there house. Then give co-ordinates for this envelope to another forum member (Co-ords are made up, they have no actual &#039;real world&#039; meaning, they are just a label for where the object is. Telling the other member them associates those co-ords with that place in the collective unconscious apparently) Then one or more of us could try and RV/Astral Project to view contents. <br /><br />Word of warning to anyone trying Astral Projection/RV: Make sure you study it thoroughly and know the dangers. Some people have reported &#039;things&#039; following them back to the real world. Whether or not you believe this, would you want to take the chance, just in case it was a real danger? Seems like a similar phenomenon as happens with Ouija board users, mental illness and bad luck seems to plague some!

				I think it is a stage a lot of people go through in their late teens early twenties. Wanting to know if there is something more out there you know?<br /><br />I still am into the occult. I find ceremonial magic works, in the same way i believe positive thinking and affirmations work: Sub consciously setting goals

				Im a firm believer in the capacity of the human brain to play tricks and the capacity of human beings to fail to propely recognise and interpret those tricks as common features of an imperfect organic being.

				I&#039;ve been into astral projection and OBEs for quite some time now. What I can tell you is that there isn&#039;t a way to describe it. It&#039;s much much more difficult to describe something like astral projection than it is to describe an LSD or DMT experience, and that&#039;s tricky enough itself. I&#039;ve never had an intentional projection - that is, whenever I have &quot;left&quot; my body, it was always when I wasn&#039;t trying to project and I always sort of, crawled/pulled my way out (for lack of better descriptors) as opposed to the way most people &quot;float&quot; out. It&#039;s like falling half-asleep (hypnagogia) and then coming out the other end, like the shadow of a dream. I could go on for days on the subject, though - PM me if you want any more info!&nbsp; :P
