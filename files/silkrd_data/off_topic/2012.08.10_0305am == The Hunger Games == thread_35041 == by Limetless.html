				I&#039;m about to watch this film, wanted to see it for ages. Is it good or am I going to be pissed off at life from being hyped about something that turns out to be a load of bollocks mildew that will take up 90-120 minutes of my life I will never get back?

				Watched it last night.. was ok... but not a patch on Battle Royale, which it&#039;s a kind of rip-off of.<br /><br />A bit too long imo.. they went into character development for too long. Worth a watch though if you&#039;ve not seen Battle Royale.

				I liked it, if anything for the weirdness and the &quot;what would I do if I got chosen...&quot; pondering. It also has a good ending. I hate movies that are awesome all the way through then have a terrible ending that ruins it for me.<br /><br />And how freaky are those wasps?! I want to concentrate that shit that comes out of their stingers and trip on it!!<br /><br />I&#039;m flipping through Netflix... cannot find ANYTHING that seems decent that I haven&#039;t already watched. Except this silent 1919 movie from Germany called The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Oh well, I digress.<br /><br />Hope you like it!

				I got Twilight-like vibes from this movie pretty much throughout the whole thing. There were parts during the movie where myself and my friend just looked at each other and tried to contain our laughter.. Just seemed cheesy and like it was trying too hard to set up for future movies in the series.<br /><br />On the flip side I know some people who really enjoyed it so maybe you&#039;ll be one of them.

				Watched this myself last night and was worried about the same thing. Don&#039;t want to give too much away, but it turned out to be fairly shite. I think it was because my expectations were too high. They didn&#039;t go into nearly enough detail about the social/political aspects of being in a post-apocolyptic advanced metropolis. The whole thing was dawn out and had far too much bollocking around in forests, and the ending was awful. I didn&#039;t feel like burning down a cinema out of disgust at the state of modern filmmaking, like with so many other piece of shit movies I have watched recently, but they really didn&#039;t do the book justice at all IMO.

				The books are far better than the show, and definitely worth a read if you are into apocalyptic-type stories. There are so many inconsistencies with the book that it should have been called &#039;The Bungle Games&#039;. The ending of the series is -slight spoiler- abit meh.

				Right I gotta say I am rather enjoying this flick. I just got past the bit where she&#039;s fucked all them cunts over with the wasps and is tripping balls coz she got stung. I am a little skeptical that was a wasp bite that did that though because that&#039;s how my vision goes when I do 200mg of Ket.....someone&#039;s been shopping on SR before they go on a survival of the shittest excursion!

				I also have a horror story to relate.<br /><br />I assiduously avoided watching the trailers for the new Batman film.

				That&#039;s horrible luck, Pine.&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t forced to watch 20 minutes of previews for movies you wouldn&#039;t see anyway, they go and ruin the whole abstention from spoilers just like that!<br /><br />After reading your post about Hunger Games having libertarian themes, I am beginning to realize perhaps it wasn&#039;t so bad after all.&nbsp; Somehow, probably from irritation and distraction, I missed those themes as I sat through the movie, when usually I am on the lookout for them as some sign that the state of things in the world might not be so bleak after all.

				i usually hate movies, but i found this one to be quite enjoyable.&nbsp; it wasn&#039;t grotesquely over-the-top with the violence, and wasn&#039;t underdone with the story and character development.&nbsp; my wife was a fan of the book and also said the movie was good.&nbsp; <br /><br />go for it dude.&nbsp; don&#039;t expect it to be the greatest thing you&#039;ve ever seen, but its a good film

				Hunger games was alright. I&#039;d say 6.5/10 because of the tween-flick style of film, but it should be nice if you get past that. Had to watch it in theaters with dudes, so there was obviously more emphasis on Jennifer Lawrence&#039;s sexiness as a brunette and nitpicking on cheesy moments

				I watched this movie the other day and I have to say it was a real let down. There was so much potential!!!!! They could have done so many crazy scenerios and all they could think of was fire balls and those 4 legged beasts at the end? The wasp part was ok. <br /><br />They also big up the part about sponsors so much and come to find out they just recieve a baloon with soup/cream?<br /><br />Also, so much craze, so much public people going crazy over the games, yet no crowed/public was shown after the initial interviews with the couples.<br /><br />What i thought was going to be an action packed hunger games turned out to be a boring long flick.<br /><br />No hate on people who enjoyed it, my gf sure did!

				I went and saw it on 2mg of 25i-NBOMe and it was wild! :)) There were these crazy ghetto ladies freaking the fuck out of the theater and they brought in like this tray of food.. and we had to yell at some teenagers to leave because they just went in the theater to chill apparently, stupid bastards. Overall it was disappointing having read the series and it felt like it was confusing for a friend that hadn&#039;t, but I tripped balls so fucking hard so I can&#039;t complain. ::)

				Remake of Total Recall is utter shit. There&#039;s no LET DEES PEHPULL HAVE AIR or Mars dome shootouts.<br /><br />Hunger Games was meh, the entire idea was ripped and the girl was never forced to kill the rest of the competitors because they conveniently died of deus ex machina. Terribad tween hype, lazy scifi.<br /><br />Wait for Elysium to come out, though it also looks like it completely ripped the book Neuromancer,&nbsp; Villa Straylight and all. <br />

				Here is a extract of a thread from Freenet on the Hunger Games... it is interesting as it traverses concepts entirely missed by the SR community...<br /><br />&nbsp;I.E. That the Hunger Games conditions audiences to believe that violence against pre-teens is acceptable behavior whereas affection is forbidden. <br />And...<br />That the Hunger Games accustoms movie-goers who are uncritical of its premise that child pornography is acceptable via substituting sex for violence.<br />And...<br />That the mainstream view is irreconcilable/inverted in that it is the commonly held community belief that:<br />underage SEXUAL contact = violence = bad<br />whereas...<br />underage VIOLENT contact = violence = good<br /><br />------------------------start---------------------<br />The premise that one would pit 12-year-old girls against 18-year-old men in an arena fight to the death as a serious competition goes beyond anything imagined in ancient Rome, where such a spectacle would have been regarded as a simple execution. It is so ridiculous that one must look for an ulterior motive behind it.<br /><br />If movie audiences would accept preteens being killed for entertainment, in reality in the story and in simulation for real audiences, why would they not be made more accepting of child &quot;pornography&quot; in the process? Any state that legalizes the televised killing of preteens, as in the story, as a matter of course would have legalized child pornography. By extention, The Hunger Games subliminally accustoms movie-goers who are uncritical of its premise that child pornography is acceptable entertainmment by substituting violence, hurtcore, for (most of) the sex.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a close parallel of the 1999 Japanese book and 2002 movie, Battle Royale. Japan, of course, is the society most accepting of child pornography and 1999 was the year that the Japanese government began to restrict its production.<br /><br />The author of The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins, claims not to have heard of the Japanese work until her book was published. She claimed to have gotten the inspiration from so-called reality TV shows. There was in fact a reality show in 2007 featuring children called Kid Nation which was claimed by some as TV for pedophiles and child abuse although there was little sex or violence. And that in turn was compared to Lord of the Flies.<br /><br />The Hunger Games won numerous awards as a book for children and young adults.&nbsp; Violence seems always more acceptable to audiences than sex, even soft core implied sex or just sexiness. Most of the time it is violence without sex. In this case, it seems the violence is a straight substitute for sex in such a way that readers and audiences will accept it. And some sex does remain.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />----- Anonymous ----- 2012.07.23 - 15:17:12GMT -----<br /><br />The premise of Hunger Games is ridiculous, sure, but is it more ridiculous than that of John Carter? Or Snakes on a Plane? Mainstream cinema is an escapist artform and unreality is not just one of its major drawing cards, but an expectation of most paying audiences. That doesn&#039;t mean that there might not be ulterior motives but there&#039;s no way in an industry like Hollywood that any motive comes even close to competing with the profit motive. Any movie will only be allowed to express any other motives insofar as is it deemed unlikely to affect the bottom line.<br /><br />But there&#039;s a more fundamental reason I find your argument unconvincing, and that is the implicit connection you make between violence and sex. Depictions of violence against children may be acceptable and even selectively promoted as entertainment, while depictions of (non-violent) sexuality might be taboo; but you make no suggestion as to why the former is necessarily a substitute for the latter. Depictions of underage drug-use is also acceptable in certain entertainment. Is it too then a &#039;substitute&#039; for sex? This seems silly, but there&#039;s no more reason for seeing a connection between the two than you provide.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying that you are wrong. Early psychoanalysis from Freud through to Reich and Laing claimed a very strong connection between violence and sex, seeing suppression of sex as a cause of violence. Radical feminism assumes the two to be so absolutely equivalent such that all sexual acts are violent to the degree that the society they occur in is sexist. I don&#039;t believe these ideologies hold up to serious scrutiny, because they cannot prove that the participants in violence or sex are always operating under the presumed connections. To convince me that Hunger Games subliminally makes violence a strawman for sex you would have to do what these belief systems fail to do: show an explicit pathway by which the violence must be interpretable by the viewer only as a symbol for sex. Otherwise it is just an open metaphor, and it is merely your own perceptions where the link is being made.<br /><br />There&#039;s another problem: the assumption that sex is actually the taboo. Actually, with regards to children there&#039;s as much sex as there is violence in the mainstream media. The taboo is not against sex, but against the possiblity of it being desired, enjoyable, or free from punishment. It&#039;s perfectly OK to graphically depict children as victims of sex. Just watch SVU or any of the heroic-cop dramas. The more despicable the abuse the more acceptable it is to show. Controversy only arises when someone dares to depict enjoyment or willing participation without there being dire consequences later. Look at the Canadian laws which explicitly make illegal any depiction of underage sexuality that isn&#039;t unquestionably negative. The real fear is of openly speaking the truths that everybody knows - that minors do have sexual desires, and that they can give consent in response to them, whether or not that is seen as acceptable or legal.<br /><br />There is a double standard with violence, but it is not the one which you suggest. As with sex, children seen as victims of violence is fine; but there are far fewer depictions of children as perpetrators of violence. Likewise, children using drugs and being irrevocably harmed is acceptable; but children enjoying drug use and growing up into normal adults is disallowed.<br /><br />The similarity between these rules reveals the true motive at work and it is anything but ulterior. The message is that sex for children is as harmful as violence and drug addiction, and just as one cannot consent to or enjoy a beating or an addiction, children cannot consent to or enjoy sex. Magically, violence and addiction remain harmful once you turn 18 but sex suddenly becomes a possibility...<br /><br />It is a taboo exactly as defined by Freud: everyone knows the truth, but heaven protect those who refuse to perpetuate the lie. Everyone is required to echo the lie, and the only way to limit the cognitive dissonance is to frame a scapegoat, someone who epitomises the lie and can be publically punished for hinting at the truth. That&#039;s why the pagans had to be burned as Satanists and witches, and why the liberals and civil rights activists had to be blacklisted as Communists. We have to be imprisoned for life as rapists and molesters, because if we weren&#039;t everyone else would have to admit to their willing participation in the lie.<br /><br />Greetings, fellow scapegoats :)<br />
