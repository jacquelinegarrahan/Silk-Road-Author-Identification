				I&#039;m constantly helping patients with cannabis questions and I might as well help any SR user as well. I have been in the cannabis scene for over 10 years and I am very knowledgeable with several different topics. I have worked at smoke shops, with growers, MMJ clinics, converting THC, and just ingesting THC in general (smoking, vaping, eating, etc). I obviously will not reveal my secret formulas for my edibles but I will help out in general so go ahead and ask me a question that is cannabis related.<br /><br />*Note* I am very limited on the subject of growing, I have never needed to grow and have only worked for growers so please keep this in mind!

While it does make your THC more potent you really need to have the chemistry down to do it right, if you have the skills and lab equipment than by all means go for it. I personally do not go for it because of the simple fact that it gives the THC a more psychedelic feel and most customers would rather have the good ol&#039; mellow high of THC rather than a potent psychedelic high, but maybe in the future I will offer a more potent product that has gone through isomerization&nbsp; :)

				It&#039;s awesome to find someone who knows something about the subject. I have experimented my self but never under ideal conditions, which led to unsure results. Did you have any luck using weaker/safer acids like citric and acetic. Because all the literature I read mentioned obscure acids that were difficult to source.

In the end ISO oil will only be useful if you have weak cannabis (shake/trim/lows), I have access to cheap mids so there is no need to use Isomerization but I would suggest it to anyone that only has access to low quality cannabis.

				I already kind of know about this, but could you explain the purpose of &quot;bridling&quot; the stem before you harvest the plant.<br /><br />And, what is the best method of making a female plant a hermaphrodite&nbsp; for the purposes of producing feminized seeds.
