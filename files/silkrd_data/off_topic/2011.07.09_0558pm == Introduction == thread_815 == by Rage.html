				Hello Fellow Silk Roaders,<br /><br />I was on the old forums and just realized today that they had been archived and the new ones were here. Anyway, with all the media attention going on, I know we have quite a few new members (hi feds) and wanted to take time to reintroduce myself.<br /><br />I&#039;m Rage and I deal in &#039;interesting&#039; and unique things. I am not a drug seller (that market is waaay too saturated for my tastes) so I know I don&#039;t totally &#039;fit in&#039; with a lot of the trade going on here. But if you&#039;re looking for anything &#039;different&#039;, send me a message and I can probably get it for you. If you&#039;d rather communicate through PGP encrypted email, let me know that too and I&#039;ll send you my public key.<br /><br />Peace,<br />Rage

				I would love to see some local food which you cant buy in other parts of the world.<br /><br />Especially shipped from EU would be great due to stupid meat and milk products import regulations. <br /><br />Lol is this part of your unique products ?

				No, it&#039;s not. But I thought about doing that for a while. Maybe selling some of the stuff that&#039;s a bit harder to get but super tasty and in demand. Shipping safely (as in it not spoiling) is part of the problem though since I couldn&#039;t really use USP/FedEx and I have no contacts in the exotic food industry yet.. <br /><br />Peace,<br />Rage
