				I was wondering if it&#039;s appropriate to try and post where you live in hopes that a seller may live near you so in instances where receiving something very quickly is critical, maybe a face-to-face would be possible dependent upon the sellers decisions towards that. Obviously this would be a very rare occurrence. But what do you guys think?? is it possible?? If its a bad idea feel free to spit that idea right back in my face.

				Maybe if you built up a ridiculously good relationship over a long period of time I&#039;m sure they&#039;d try and help you out but as johnmtl says a vendor would be crazy to meet someone IRL.<br /><br />There&#039;s a reason they use SR rather than standing about on street corners.

				If I was a seller and I got an order from somebody who lived in the same town as me I would either cancel their order or bounce it off an out of state address because I wouldn&#039;t want some strange person coming to my house looking to purchase illegal substances...
