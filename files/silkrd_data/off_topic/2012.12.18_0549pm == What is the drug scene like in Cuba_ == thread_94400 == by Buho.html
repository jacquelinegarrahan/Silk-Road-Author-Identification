				As I have understood it is increasingly a transit point for Yayo heading to the US &amp; EU. In the eighties there were claims, that the government and especially Raúl Castro was involved, in allowing the cartels to use Cuban airspace/waters.<br /><br />But what about the street scene so to speak? Drug laws must be pretty fucking brutal! Are there tourists in Cuban prisons due to possessing drugs?
