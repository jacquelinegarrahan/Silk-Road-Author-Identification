				<br />Since i don&#039;t think gear is considered a drug I guess this post belongs here. <br />I&#039;ve never done any cycles but from what I hear a test only cycle is good to start at. I was wondering if any one could tell me like a begginer cycle together with everything I need before during and after the cycle. I&#039;m looking to cut up some and gain some strength but i want minimum sides. Right now i weigh 190 and am 5 ft 11 also what kind and size pins do I need and&nbsp; where can I get them. Also are their any vendors who I can get everything I need for the cycle and buy it as a package?&nbsp;

				You can find a lot of info from &lt;&lt;CLEARNET WARNING&gt;&gt; http://www.steroid.com and/or you can ask your vendor many questions as well. Most of these guys know their products very well and will even recommend a cycle depending on your goal.<br /><br />The website above also has other links for &quot;Steroid Injections&quot; (http://www.steroid.com/Steroid-Injections.php) and Steroid Cycles &amp; Stacks (http://www.steroid.com/steroid_cycles.php). IMO, it&#039;s probably the best overall site for this stuff.<br /><br />

				Depending on your age you can get a lot better results by clean eating and disciplined form in the gym<br /><br />If you are under 26 and void of any serious medical issues otherwise, you are already creating a metric fuckton of testosterone in your balls. Giving your body the FUEL and proper rest is key to utilizing that natural hormone production. Save your cash while you can and just keep tearing that iron and munching brotein. <br /><br />Like jda pointed out, forums.steroid.com has the most extensive information available to anyone wanting to learn and plan a cycle, but it&#039;s not a cure all to being fat or skinny. You&#039;ve got to have discipline and work like a fucking madman already otherwise you will be just injecting $500 into your body, growing tits, receding your hairline and then have little to no gains to show for it. <br /><br />It is advisable to get down to 12-15% body fat before taking a Test cycle. Carrying extra fat cells increases the chance of aromatase (estrogen synthase i.e. moobs) However, you can also purchase an AI (Aromatase Inhibitor) to inject along with the cycle to decrease the chances. <br /><br />More important to the actual Testosterone supplement is the Post Cycle therapy required to normalize your natural test production after the cycle is complete. When injecting, your lazy nuts will stop clocking in at work since it will be handled by a more effective outsourcing substance. When you run out, it takes awhile to ramp up so for two weeks you will need to take Nolvadex/Clomid to keep any size/gains from the cycle.<br /><br />One of the problems that is slightly under represented in steroid use is not having explicitly perfect form when lifting - Taking a cycle will have you putting on weights and plates very quickly and increasing very rapidly. Without a great base of form, the risk of serious injury becomes much larger to the point where your lifting career could be over for good<br /><br />http://www.t-nation.com/strength-training-search/video (http://www.t-nation.com/strength-training-search/video)<br />Has a GREAT video library for technique - the trainer really knows his shit as well<br />http://forums.steroid.com/anabolic-steroids-questions-answers/ (http://forums.steroid.com/anabolic-steroids-questions-answers/)<br />Tons of information regarding cycle, safety and diet<br /><br />As for a vendor on the SR - I have not got any anabolic from him but I have had success with his Clen/T3/Sub stack <br />flaxceed<br /><br />If you get through his wall of text vendor page, he&#039;s actually got pretty good insight on steroidology and training<br /><br />Good luck, make good decisions. <br />
