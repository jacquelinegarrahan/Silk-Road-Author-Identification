				Some do, some don&#039;t. I&#039;ve never not been paid back when I&#039;ve given a loan... Normally I don&#039;t give them to people with less than 100 posts though, just a trust issue.

				I&#039;ve found most people pay back, be prepared to wait a lot longer than the &quot;I swear it will be paid back in 7 days, exactly 7 days no longer&quot;.

				Ehh, I think one person paid me back with interest (his idea) so that was lovely. If I&#039;m feeling good though, I&#039;ll just hand out BTCs to anyone if I have leftovers.&nbsp; :) -regardless of their post count.

However, you are a far more generous person than am I.<br /><br />My rule of thumb is as follows, if I were to lend, it would only be so much as to help the lendee make a purchase that he was close to being able to afford ( less than 1 or 2 btc) not enough to make a substantial purchase.

				I probably wouldn&#039;t lend out any BTC, just not worth the risk. I&#039;d sooner just donate 20 or 30 cents to someone who&#039;s a bit short

				i&#039;ve loaned people 3 times now, think the least was about 0.36btc or something and the most was 1.30btc. 1 coin is like $5! i wouldn&#039;t lend that to people i met on the street, but i thought if i was ever short i&#039;d like someone to repay the favour. never received anything back even after the &#039;i&#039;ll pay you back next week&#039; promises.so those fuckers have ruined it for everyone else now - i won&#039;t loan any more.<br /><br />TBH thinking about it, if i was short for an order i&#039;d sooner transfer more cash over than be seen as a sponge on this site, anonymous or not - your username is still seen as a ponce
