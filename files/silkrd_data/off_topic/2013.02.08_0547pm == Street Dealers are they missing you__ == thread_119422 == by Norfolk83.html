				Dont tell them regardless of your balls. No low life corner dealer need know about this thing of ours. <br /><br />I was a dealer for many many years, of a wide array of goodies, and i can tell you with the utmost confidence that the only dealers that would ever be placing calls to custys, are ones that are BS dealers. No dealer that makes any decent amount of cash, would ever care to or have the time to call a custy, especially ones that havnt been buying in how ever long.

				Wouldn&#039;t miss them, and they wouldn&#039;t miss me. When I say I&#039;m done, It isn&#039;t like they could convince me to start smoking meth.<br /><br />I mean, its not like I am smoking this weed, and all of a sudden say &quot; I should start smoking meth&quot;, just doesn&#039;t happen. You get me?

				I always have guys trying to get with me and I&#039;m like &quot;No. Get out of here you silly guy. I don&#039;t do drugs. Drugs are bad.&quot; And then they look all hurt and hobble away. I feel bad but it&#039;s for the best. I want them to think I got clean, not that I&#039;m leaving them for something better. <br /><br />I advocate lying. It hurts less people. ;)<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				Well done generation Y.<br /><br />I dated a disenfranchised stoner boy, and although I was familiar with weed, I was never a regular smoker. We banged a lot, and he had no connects and I had some shitty connects. He&#039;d give me the money, I&#039;d pick it up, he&#039;d smoke me up and we&#039;d screw. My shitty connects gradually got less shitty and I started directly selling to him. <br /><br />Hes beautiful. I wanna do drugs with him. Molly and shrooms and nbomes and 2cb and everything that&#039;d make fucking even more fun and bring us closer together. As long as I can keep it up anyhow. I&#039;m still seeing him; hes BF material if I could ever get him interested in a relationship. (Until then, I&#039;ve got half a dozen girls on the side).<br /><br />bi boys have more fun. <br /><br />:3
