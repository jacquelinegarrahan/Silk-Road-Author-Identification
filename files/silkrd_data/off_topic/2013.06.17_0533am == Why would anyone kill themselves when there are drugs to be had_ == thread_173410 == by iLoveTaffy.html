				This is mostly in reply to that latest suicide thread.<br /><br />Why? I mean, there&#039;s heroin, LSD, meth, shrooms, crack, cocaine, opium, DMT, goodass marijuana to smoke at relax, benzos to help, espcially with anxiety and MDMA/psychedelic comedown (I slept 6=8 hours after dosing 160mcg LSD with 40mg Valium) so much fucking shit you can use day in and day out and have a fucking blast..<br /><br />Does anyone else agree with me? Sure, this world sucks fucking cocks, but at least it gives you a respite in the form of sweetass drugs.<br /><br />I love drugs.

				I know, but there&#039; always shit you can do. Prostitute yourself, give me BJs and shit. Isn&#039;t that better than dying? Fuck.<br /><br />A lot of these suicidal people HAVE some money to spend, too! Damn, I have MDD, and I&#039;m depressed as HELL, but I&#039;d NEVER commit suicide. I have way too much fun with drugs.

				what is it man, drugs or taffy, which do you love more? yeah drugs are nice but they don&#039;t cure depression or anxiety for a lot of people/aren&#039;t a permanent solution. benzos tend to exacerbate depression. anti depressants made me so intent on killing myself to the point i was spending 5+ hours a day reading shit and making some bonkers plans. i&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve never suffered from depression but if you&#039;ve ever had a bad trip just imagine that feeling, less intense but a constant uncomfortable nagging that makes you feel so shit you just want it to fuck off and nothing you do helps. it affects every single part of your life, even your ability to enjoy drugs!!!! WHAT?! no really.

Thinking that everything is ended just because your body is functional no more is the typical misunderstanding of people that have experienced only this material plane.<br /><br />If I would accidentally fall in a condition that my body is useful no more I will simply fully go into the so-called astral or etheric plane and live there the rest of my days. No need of arms, legs, eyes or ears there.<br />And guess what? Drugs are actually a way on which you can do that (there are many more but certain drugs can give the opportunity to people that don&#039;t know them or have not the background to do them, to be able to do the same), so, you see, you tried contradicting what the OP said (and btw even if you were right you could have been less rude, no need to go all angry on a discussion) but you actually have proven his point. Good job.<br /><br />Btw either with conditions that scientifically are associated with brain damage etc. there is NO proof that your consciousness is not there (actually there are more proofs of the contrary), and that you are not, actually, perfectly happy as you are where you are. But this last is a difficult topic and even I have personal doubts about what I would do in that situation.

				I don&#039;t think you need a reason to kill yourself, much less a good one. <br />oh, drab, a fly landed up in mine yonder soup. *Racks Shotgun* **BOOM**<br />if life is yours to decide how you see it and your responsability alone to deal with the repurcussions then it only follows you have a right to death, and indeed when you keep your mouth shut generaly people let you do as you will without trying to intervein even when it ought to be quiet obvious somethings up. most people are just selfish pricks that way and usually only say shit when they have to to make themselves not feel like they are making a bad social impression but that doesn&#039;t necesarily reflect what they really think or feel. ..as complex as the absolute nature of thought and feeling can be. <br />

				I tried MDMA and LSD for the first times when I was at the end of it all, the point where it was either kill myself or try anything. I went with try anything first, and it seems to have worked out.

				Go at you, mate. That&#039;s good. See? Suicide is fucking lame. LSD and MDMA are two of the best drugs there are.<br /><br />Amazing that people die without trying them.

				no one can say what happens after death so no one can say they know its bad. we just know it hurts in most cases, but so does child birth.we also know that without death life would not be living and that we would be overcrowded and burn through natural resources at a rate that would then cause us to die anyways or live in misery.
