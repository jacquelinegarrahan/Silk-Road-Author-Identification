				Let me first say that I am new here, but there is a long time member and seller here with 100% feedback that (wish his permission) will vouch for my circumstance. <br /><br />Before you read the next part, please know I am asking for no handouts. You don’t know me and to do so would be completely out of line. If you read it’s entirety, I promise to put in a good word for you when I get to heaven!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />The basic deal is this. I have stage 3 stomach cancer and am a 34 year old female. <br /><br />I had some Bitcoins on here that I have had for a while and decided to hang onto them as long as I could. Plus, I didn’t know the full extent of my prognosis and didn’t think I’d have any problems financially wise. I had some ideas lined up that fell through and this is how I’ve come to you. I have no friends or family that can help.<br /><br />I apologize for the long explanation and I digress…<br /><br />The doctors here are so worried about the DEA that they won&#039;t give me anything other than Lortab (sp?) 5&#039;s, 4 a day until I have been diagnosed with 3 months to live. Right now, they are giving me 6-8 months. I am a believer and I have not given up hope, but all is not OK in my world right now.<br /><br />I think, during my newbie days, I was phished and as a result lost about half of my BTC&#039;s...guess they could have taken them all, but by the Grace of God they didn&#039;t. I had I think 48 left and when the pain got to be too intense, I came on here to buy some pain medicine and Xanax so I could sleep.<br /><br />To my surprise, I found a seller on here offering cash for Bitcoins (the one I know personally now mentioned above) and as much pain as I was in, I decided to sell them to him because I weighed the options (sleeping on the street or pain) and the street lost. Like I said, I am a young woman and unfortunately have to admit I’ve spent a few nights on the street and was scared, lonely and sick. <br /><br />Can you believe this man gave me his phone number to call if I ever needed to talk? I find that absolutely unbelievable. He has become a wonderful friend, but cash wise is strapped right now and boy can I not fault him for that!<br /><br />No shelters within 50 miles that will take women and the ones who do won’t take me because I am sick and up half the night a result. They are Government funded and the liability, with my condition, is something they cannot work with. I understand it, but it’s sad. Until I was laid off, I never took a day off from work…EVER. Except for the 3 weeks off to have my son, who is now 6 and I will miss him everyday even when I die. This I know. I’ve worked full time from the age of 16, bought my own house at 23 and somehow made it through College.<br /><br />Again…I digress…<br /><br />I sold him my remaining coins for a nice value and had my money in minutes. It saved my life for a few days, literally and I will never be able to come up with a word bigger than the appreciation I have for him! Truly above and beyond and I wish I could pay him for his service considering what he did for me. <br /><br />One thing to understand here is I have never been a drug or alcohol abuser in my life. It seems most of the people I know personally, all of them do, from Coke to LSD and it doesn’t change my perspective of them. They are my friends because I love them, not because of what they put into their bodies if that makes sense. <br /><br />AKA: I do not judge, anyone or anytime. <br /><br />To add another chapter...my &quot;problems&quot; started 2 years ago when my high school sweetheart husband left me for another woman. This was 2 weeks after my 2nd diagnosis. I was laid off from a very good job that I had for years due to a corporate merger and then within weeks of that the transmission blew on my car, so I am now homeless, car less, and practically penniless. Two years ago, I had not much, but in the neighborhood of 5k in the bank (which was ex withdrew the day before he didn&#039;t come home), so I had no money to fix my car or much less to buy a new one with no job. <br /><br />So my bottom line is this (thank God, right?)<br /><br />I can’t find any of the links now, but when I first started my exploration here, I saw many places offering free bitcoins for certain things. Do any such, legitimate programs work? <br /><br />I am in desperate need of some medicine and don’t know any alternatives. <br /><br />I also need $150 for the next 3 days to survive and not be on the street until the cancer center that has been helping me can get me money on Saturday.<br /><br />So…if ANYONE has ANY ideas, suggestions or help to get me by they would be most appreciated. I’ve contacted every agency for help within 50 miles and no one has funding or a way to help. I even applied for disability over a year ago that doesn’t seem to be coming through anytime soon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank you for reading. <br />

				I&#039;m really sorry to hear all this. I hope things start going better for you in the time you do have left. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know much about free bitcoin programs, although i would venture to guess that most of them are scams, and the ones that aren&#039;t wouldnt get you nearly enough money to help without much more resources than you have.<br /><br />I do have a couple of suggestions, and I hope you read them with an open mind...<br /><br />1. pawn your computer, or anything valuable you have... this should get you enough money to get you medicine or a hotel until saturday. if you pitch the same story to the pawnshop or 2, I bet they&#039;ll be sympathetic (although they might just think your a junkie... but fuck it, worth a shot?)<br /><br />2. look on craigslist for odd jobs. a lot of older people will pay you to do things around the house, and some of them might offer you a place to stay as well...<br /><br />3. go to the hosptial. if you have stage 3 stomach cancer and are in a lot of pain, I would be really suprised if they sent you home with nothing. I also find it really suprising that your doctor will only give you lortab 5&#039;s for stage 3 stomach cancer. i know people that get stronger lortabs for restless legs and intermittent knee pain. if this is really the case, you need to switch doctors immediately, because obviously your treatment is not important. I live in an area where Drs are heavily regulated and watched over when it comes to pain pills, but it&#039;s certainly justifiable to give cancer patients real pain meds like dilaudid and oxy... this makes no sense to me<br /><br />4. this is probably really personal, but do you not have friends/family that can help you? if not, I would recommend you make some friends. support groups would be a great place to start. <br /><br />5. It&#039;s hard to trust people on here... I think the odds of someone helping you on another forum would be greater. cafe mom? or cancer related forums would be better suited than this (although i know your question was related to free bit coin programs, maybe they would actually help with cash).<br /><br />6. join a church, or a biker gang... i dont believe in god or own a bike, but it seems both of these groups love helping people in need.<br /><br />good luck!

				Your doctors suck. Sorry but they do. When I had pain for something else (not life threatening) I had a prescription for 180 dilaudid a month. At the same time I had a bottle of 150 oxycodone. Later when things were better the doc said what do you need? I said I gotta get off this stuff so he gave me 150 more oxycodone and then next month 150 vicodin to start weaning off of it. On the flip side, it all takes good insurance and it doesn&#039;t sound like you&#039;re in that position. Still...your doctors just suck to only give you 4 lortabs a day.

				Prove to me that without a doubt you are in the situation you say and I&#039;ll purchase you a 6-8 month supply of pain medicine from SR and have it delivered to you.<br />I&#039;ll also send you $160 in BTC, an extra $10 in case they deflate/for exchanging.<br /><br />I won&#039;t be easy to convince, but do it and I will do what I say above.

				I am inclined to believe this could by all means happen here in the us. regionally some of our resources for the homeless are so tied up in state/fed/munic budget woes that they can&#039;t afford a misstep like wrongful death or some other silly reason to not help those who need help...<br /><br />I am extremely sorry for your situation, if you have a bank account that is still open, there are outrageously priced short term credit places&nbsp; online, that can wire up to 1500 to your account, (with a 450% apr) they are risky, but in plain terms, what do you have to lose?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Hi and thanks for replying with the support and ideas. As far as my computer, it&#039;s a dinosaur. I only got 1 pawn shop who would take it and he offered me $10. Considering all I own in this world is the computer and my maybe 6 sets of clothing, I didn&#039;t think $10 would do me much good considering my goal.<br /><br />I have looked on CL and found several (over the months) odd jobs that I&#039;ve done, but haven&#039;t found anything in probably 2 weeks, although I continue to look.<br /><br />In regards to the hospital, I have definitely considered it. Don&#039;t know what they&#039;ll do but I know I won&#039;t have to pay up front. It appears by the response here, that might be where I head next. Yes, surprising to me also that is all he gives me. <br /><br />I am a member of a local support group for cancer victims here locally. They are a wonderful group of people but many close to my situation and not able to help. I&#039;ve offered room and board in exchange for different things and nothing has come as of yet.<br /><br />The only family members I have left are my twin sister who, herself, cannot work due to debilitating headaches. No diagnosis but this has been going on for 10+ years. My dad is nearly 70 years old and unable to work and my mom is working 2 jobs to pay both mortgages, cars, etc. She hasn&#039;t even called me in nearly 3 months due to all her stress. I know she loves me, but I am in so much distress that she isn&#039;t &quot;available&quot;. I even offered to move in and help her the last time we talked. Her response was &quot;I don&#039;t know, let me think on it&quot;. I don&#039;t blame her with what all she is going through. <br /><br />I understand and can see it is hard to trust people on here. Thanks for the ideas of the other groups to join. You never know I guess...thanks again!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5192.msg44006#msg44006">Quote from: sandycheeks on November 09, 2011, 12:15 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;m really sorry to hear all this.

As mentioned above, my next step will be the hospital. I never, ever want to create a bill anywhere that I know I cannot repay, but it appears I have no choice. I don&#039;t know what they will do but I have to try. <br /><br />You may not have heard of the shelter rules I am speaking of, but you lose everything (prayerfully you won&#039;t and I am NOT wishing that on you) and you will see.<br /><br />Finally, The $150 needed is 3 nights in a hotel at $50 a night. The only other cheaper hotel (by $10 a night I think it was) had no easily accessible places to walk to should I need to.<br /><br />Thanks for replying. I understand and respect your position. Please do remember, I am not and was not asking for anyone to give me anything. I asked for advice on free BTC programs or any other advice.<br /><br />God Bless.

				Ok, if you have cancer and are jobless, no hospital will or can refuse care to you. you can also sign up for patient assistance programs. purdue pharma has them, Fentora, has them, opana program (Endo) has them. it only takes 3 weeks to get approved and meds into your hands.. why not try this?

I understand that no hospital will refuse my care. I am just seriously doubting they could admit me until the time came for me to go to treatment. If they did, that would be excellent. I am imagining the worst (I guess because I&#039;m dealing with my all time low) that they will give me a few days, pat me on the back and wish me luck. <br /><br />My own doctor, personally, called the hospitals for me. He knows my financial situation and is helping me in any way he can. I venture to say I pray for that man every single day for caring above what he has to.<br /><br />Anyway, they basically told him that unless I have a &quot;new&quot; condition and they can find a cause than my already existing diagnosis of cancer, they more than likely could not admit me. <br /><br />BUT like I said, even through the he@@ I am going through and everything is literally falling apart around me, I am still going to fight until the end. I guess if you could say one thing about me, it’s that I don’t easily give up even when hopelessness surrounds me. <br /><br />I am still going to the hospital ASAP and begging for some kind of help…whether it be a suggestion or alternative to what I’m doing now, I will take it! <br /><br />As far as the patient assistance programs, I have to say that I was unaware of them. I will check them out now and thanks again. You can&#039;t know...none of you can...what your support in your replies means to me. Even the negative ones who think I&#039;m a scam artist, I totally get you and certainly don&#039;t fault you.<br /><br />B<br /><br /><br />

				We really need to discourage this kind of crap.&nbsp; Please respect the site and take this elsewhere.&nbsp; Real or not, it encourages scammers to come up with even better stories...plus all this phone calls and other communications?&nbsp; You need to remember where you are at and don&#039;t encourage this kind of behavior...between LE trying to get next to people, and just run-of-the-mill internet cry-for-money garbage...o well, if you go for it, I guess you&#039;ll learn....
