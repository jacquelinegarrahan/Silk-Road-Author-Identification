				I plan to be traveling around europe this summer and will probably get some nice MDMA hook ups when I get to germany. I was just wondering what the security is like on the eurorail. I was thinking that If I just unscrew a shampoo bottle or something and throw the baggy in there I&#039;d be fine but idk if they scan carry-on backpacks or not.<br /><br />input?

				Im not European but&nbsp; lived in Germany for 2 years and only rose the Bahnhoff(train). Your biggest worry is getting a fine for not having a ticket. Not once was I messed with or seen anyone messed with or searched. The fast train (ICE) you just get onto all of the trains you just get onto no security. <br /><br />The only time a saw a dog or anything like that was leaving Amsterdamn and for obvious reasons.

				I&#039;m from Germany and if you&#039;re just travelling &quot;normal&quot; routes there won&#039;t be anybody searching for drugs for 99.99% (I was born here, grew up here and am still living here and I&#039;ve NEVER seen something like that).<br />From Netherlands to Germany chances to get in trouble are relatively high for obvious reasons ;)<br />Anyways it&#039;s easy to take drugs with you in a train without getting caught even if they find the drugs. Just place them in the trash or elsewhere (you should be able to watch the place as you don&#039;t want to make a stranger happy with them, do you? :D) and make sure you don&#039;t leave fingerprints on your baggy, of course. Don&#039;t forget them when leaving the train :D

				yeah, do it as the guy above me has posted - get earliest in the train and hide your stuff elsewhere - get out at latest of the train and collect your stuff - done that a couple of time... no problem at all!&nbsp; ;)

				So basically its a really bad idea to leave the netherlands with any sort of drugs? do they just walk around the train with a dog? I may be going to the netherlands too so I&#039;m gonna need advice on that too haha. I was thinking about buying mushroom truffles and then going somewhere with them. I don&#039;t want to trip in amsterdam just because their isn&#039;t much for me too look at (I like fields and parks and stuff). So just hide the shrooms somewhere on the train? Wouldn&#039;t a dog find them?<br /><br />Thanks for the advice though guys

				Here&#039;s how I&#039;ve taken drugs from Netherlands to Germany:<br />1.) Buy the drugs :D<br />2.) Put on some gloves<br />3.) Put them in a baggy<br />4.) Change your gloves. Use some you&#039;ve never touched any drug with before.<br />5.) Put another baggy around the first one.<br />6.) Put the 2 baggys in a third one. Fill up the space that&#039;s left with coffee.<br />7.) If you want to be really sure, do some more baggys with coffee around them.<br />8.) Do the train method descriped above.<br /><br />I&#039;ve done this a couple of times, two times there were dogs but they didn&#039;t smell it.<br />But again:<br />MAKE SURE TO NOT LEAVE FINGERPRINTS ON ANY OF YOUR BAGGYS! Even if they find your drugs, only thing you&#039;ve got to fear is loosing your money.
