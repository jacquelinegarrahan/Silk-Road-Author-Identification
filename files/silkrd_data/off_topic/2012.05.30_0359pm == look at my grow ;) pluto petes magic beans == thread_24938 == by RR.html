Lowryder2 was much stronger but it got tainted by the bad rep of the original. My Devon Maid gets a lot of it&#039;s flavour from the Hindu Kush, it really is a delicious smoke. <br />Autoflowers often get badmouthed by people that tried the Lowrider or read about it, not realizing the advances made since then, in a blind test you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell my bud from any good Indica :)<br />Autoflowers are the future, as more and more people realize the advantages, and more and more good crosses appear, they&#039;ll take over :)

				PlutoPetes seeds are the business ! ive had all 13 of mine germinate with no problems at all, just straight into pre-wetted compo mix, no soaking or cracking, and every one has popped up no later than 5 days later, most within 3 days !<br /><br />thats the best rate ive ever had out of a pack of seeds !

				i got a 300w and i cant complain it costs 66p a day on a prepay&nbsp; meter and thats 18hrs a day and as you can see they doing well, it would cost 1.12 a day for a 600w hps thats quite a difference but if i had the space i would go for a hps no doubt, biggest problem i got is the smell them buds are stinky, and they are going to get worse yet, might end up in the loft, nighhtmare......

				Pot plants are not meant to be grown under 24hrs of light.. I bet the % of hermies is very high with those seeds.

				yeah i been watering once a day the biggest one gets about 1/2L a day and nutrients every 3days, just had another look at them and the buds are stacking up nicely on top of each other, like building blocks, and i aint had any males yet out off the 11 seeds that sprouted outta 18 i brought all have been females so far just 6 are to young to tell yet but fingers crossed, and there aint no way on earth a male will ever make it in to my grow space, id destroy it before it ever got started, i like bud and it really pisses me off when i find seeds in my bud cos if you grow properly and dont rush you can prevent it from happening easy. plus your giving away free seeds...... i always try to germinate seeds i find very rare that they are alive prob cos they been dried right out.

				i will put a couple of updated pics on later today, they are really going for it now, and in my short experience they seem to do there growing when the lights are off, maybe a dark period is good for them, now my biggest problem is smell i need HELP, lights been on for a couple of hours and my room smells like ive smoked 10 biftas in it, been looking at carbon filter extractor kits but they are mega expensive, dont know what to do about it as we got house guests next week so they may have to go in the loft witch i dont want to do if i can help it cos of all the dust ext up there plus it will heat loft space and it only takes one chopper to pass over and see the heat sig from my roof and i will get raided........ HELP im going tesco to look for citrus magic but another ideas ???

				Heat helps with the uptake of water and nutrients..<br /><br />If your grow is under 20&#039;C it takes the plant a long time to uptake the nutrients.... The slower the uptake the slower the growth..... <br /><br /><br />When you see people with large scale grows with Co2 enrichment their temps are higher than the average grow.... Creating that boost in energy so the plants grow faster and create more yield...

				I find that 25 is the real sweet spot, but anything from 20-28 is good.&nbsp; Lights off temp no lower than 18-ish.<br /><br />If you are para about growing in your loft, insulation boards (kingspan etc) will help, but in all honesty, the heat sig thing is largely propaganda anyway.&nbsp; On the rare occasions where people have been caught this way, it&#039;s because they had multiple bare bulbs on the ridge of the loft, or something similar.&nbsp; FLIR can only see surface temps, it can&#039;t actually see through anything.&nbsp; Half of the time, &quot;detected by chopper&quot; actually means &quot;grassed up by someone&quot; anyway.&nbsp; It&#039;s just one of their tricks to spread fear, because otherwise, growing is quite hard to detect.<br /><br />But yeah, insulation will help, if you are nervous.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Yep, 5 degrees or less difference between day/night temps seems to be the ideal, although since I&#039;ve been growing SCROG style, i&#039;ve been happy for whatever stretch I can get lol.<br /><br />I agree with most of the points you have made in this thread, and it&#039;s obvious you&#039;ve done your homework.&nbsp; From a production point of view, I agree with your advice all around.&nbsp; However, I suspect that some of these guys are coming from a &quot;cheap personal grow&quot; perspective, and from that perspective, i think that cfls are a viable starting point, if used properly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally, I think that large cfls are shit, and an array of 20w household cfls will do just the same job, at the same wattage.&nbsp; Spread the heat, spread the light, and keep the plants small.&nbsp; Aim for around 80-100 watts per square foot, and the results should be passable.<br /><br />I have a lot of stuff i&#039;d like to cover about cfls vs hids, the usefulness of autos, proper cfl usage etc, but I haz teh dumb at the moment (wake and bake, combined with IRL drama).&nbsp; I&#039;ll try and chip in, as I am able to lol.&nbsp; :-[

				CFLs, HIDs and &quot;heat&quot;:<br /><br />People say that CFLs produce less heat than HPS.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; The heat from cfls is spread out over a larger area, and more of it is convected rather than radiated, but both forms of lighting put out a roughly equivalent amount of heat into the room.&nbsp; CFLs are cooler close up, which is a benefit in height restricted areas (possibly the only real benefit of cfls, other than the initial price), but 200 watts of cfl will heat up your room just as much as 200 watts of hps. HID lights also have the benefit of being able to relocate the ballast elsewhere.<br /><br />The main benefit of HPS is the amount of light they are able to produce.&nbsp; A 600 watt HPS will put out double or more the amount of light than 600 watts of cfl (600 is the most efficient wattage of HPS light, lower wattages are less efficient than the 600, but still more efficient than cfl, right down to the 70 watt mark.).<br /><br />edit: to change HID to HPS where necessary.

				your really making me want to buy a 600w hps, i been looking online and i can get a hole kit for £150ish includingl lightproof tent, 600w hps with ballast, fan/filter unit with 5m ducting, nutrients. <br /><br />a single fan/filter kit is £70ish so might get the hole kit, cos this was my test run just to find out the kinda problems i might come across and also to decide whether&nbsp; to use autos or not, from what ive seen i do like autos does seem like quick and extremely easy weed to grow,but if i move it into the loft then id like to see more height, im interested in other strains that require 12h/18h lighting pattens, what are the pros and cons between the two?

				I grew for years with a stripped down flood light HPS, and it did the job just fine.&nbsp; I upgraded to digi dimmables recently, and they have some useful plus poins, but warehouse lights are a great source for cheap HID gear, as long as you don&#039;t mind a tiny bit of DIY.<br /><br />RR, that kit sounds too good to be true at that price.&nbsp; The extractor probably won&#039;t be up to the job of cooling the 600 properly.&nbsp; A 6&quot; ruck/rvk type centrifugal fan is the ideal, rather than &quot;mixed mode&quot; fans.&nbsp; They don&#039;t really provide enough pressure to pull through carbon filters very well, although the initial CFM numbers might sound impressive, since they are in free flow condition.<br /><br />Right, on to auto strains vs regular photoperiod strains.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t want to put people off buying Pete&#039;s seeds for indoor use, because they obviously do the job, and autos are a great way for beginners to get to grips with growing without having to bother about timings, lightproofing, over-vegging etc.&nbsp; However, where autos really come into their own is in outdoor grows.&nbsp; Because they flower based on age rather than light schedule, they can be taken through to harvest much earlier in the year, and as such can provide an early crop, or an opportunity to grow in climates that otherwise would be problematic.&nbsp; In countries like the UK, especially as you get further north, your strain options become limited for outdoor grows, and an early frost or damp autumn can be a disaster for many regular strains.&nbsp; Autos provide a higher chance of harvesting bud in otherwise shitty climates.<br /><br />Now, for indoor use, I think regular photo strains are more practical, and have several real advantages over autos.&nbsp; The main advantage, and one of my favourite things about growing, is the ability to clone.&nbsp; Cloning is the dog&#039;s bollocks.&nbsp; You can turn any one plant into an infinite number of identical plants, with minimum effort and cost.&nbsp; When growing from seed, there is always variation (different &quot;phenos&quot;, as they are usually termed).&nbsp; Three plants of the same strain will not necessarily be identical, and one may be superior in taste, potency, yield, flowering time etc.&nbsp; Cloning gives you the ability to grow, say, 10 seeds from a pack, find a &quot;keeper&quot; that stands out from the others, and make as many copies as you want to, with each being genetically identical to the plant it was originally cloned from.<br /><br />Another advantage to photoperiod strains is the ability to control veg times.&nbsp; You can flower freshly rooted clones and they will begin to bud straight away, potentially giving a faster turnaround time than autos, which self-veg for a few weeks.&nbsp; Alternatively, and my own chosen method for increased peace of mind, is to have fewer plants, vegged for longer before flowering.&nbsp; I grow SCROG style, which uses a net under the light with the plants trained flat to it, resulting in a screen filled with hundreds of smaller buds, rather than the classic &quot;donkey dick&quot; colas.&nbsp; It adds a couple of weeks to the standard veg time time to fill the net, but I don&#039;t mind the trade-off, if it means 4 plants do the work of 9 and I drop down a sentencing category.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Regular photoperiod strains are most useful when you have a secondary vegging area.&nbsp; That way, you can always have new plants ready to flower as the current crop is harvested.&nbsp; Your veg area doesn&#039;t need to be huge.&nbsp; A small bedside cupboard or similar, with a few 20 watt household cfls, will suffice to keep a couple of bonsai mother plants and some clones happy, although a larger and brighter veg area would be more optimal, if you have the room available.<br /><br /><br />Sorry for the post length, and sorry PlutoPete if I appear to be knocking your product in any way.&nbsp; That is certainly not my intention.&nbsp; I can honestly say that anyone who likes weed, not just people who think themselves as growers, should consider buying some of your seeds right now.&nbsp; There are loads and loads of successful guerilla grows in the UK alone every year, and even with a &quot;plant and forget&quot; mindset, your chances of getting some bud are fair, provided you put a bit of thought into your chosen location.&nbsp; Add some research into the mix, and your chances are way above average.<br /><br />Nobody ever gets caught for outdoor grows, and the worst thing that generally happens is that bunnies or slugs rape half of your plants, or some thieving little shit makes off with them.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Outdoors is the cheapest way to grow, and anyone can do it, even those who still live with parents, or have other reasons why they are unable to grow indoors.<br /><br />Again, apologies for length.&nbsp; I get carried away sometimes.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				haha love the long reply ukgrow, it made a good read, i like the sound of four plants doing the job of 9, now that does sound interesting lol, but i bet its not quite as easy as it sounds, ive got the slug problem on my outside grow and they dont just like my weed, little slime balls are attacking my runners, tomartos, and just about every plant ive planted, everyday i pull loads of slugs off my pots, i dont think my outsiders are going to make it anyhow the british weather is to all over the place, not like when i was a teenager we had sunny summers and cold winters now we get it all mixed up though the year, it would never had rained on 3rd june bk then.<br /><br />and yesterday i spent 3hours setting up in the loft and when i put the light on i saw there are huge gaps in the brick wall between us and next doors loft, kinda a lucky escape cos i just assumed i was a solid brick wall and only saw it at the last minute, my trade involves me in lofts and i can say ive not seen that before. but then again this area is totally new to me so. <br /><br />im making plans for a full on grow in a mates basement we are going to set up a partition and have a separated&nbsp; veg and flower room, using basic tube lighting for veg and a 600w hps bulb for the flowering room, we have been talking about doing it for years just never got round to doing it, but now we have started to buy materials for the build side of it and work has even started in the little free time i now get after starting a new job, and yeah we will be setting up a hydroponic watering system, already got a 4ft fish tank 3pumps and 25meters tube. need to find the best medium to use. <br /><br />now when it comes to strain im not sure at all, this is why i am doing test runs, i have petes autos and uk cheese growing, and my mate (with the basement) has purple kush and super skunk growing again under cfls for now.

				You should use 400watt Metal Halide bulbs for your veg rooms..... 1000 watt HPS for your bloom room....&nbsp; &nbsp;I had 3 x 1000 watts in a 10 x 20 room...&nbsp; 600 watt bulbs are expensive and not as available as the 1000 watt bulbs.. But that&#039;s my area... I hate ordering gear online.. I find me a decent Hydroshop an hour or more away from the grow.... <br /><br />With a similar set up I could yield with 40 plants .. around 5-6 pounds per cycle.....<br /><br />Don&#039;t go nuts mixing strains.. Stick to 2 strains per room that grow good together or split the room in half... You dont want to grow a pure indica with a pure sative.... Keep the strains similar in size..... Get to know your strains so you can get the most from them... <br /><br />I finished my last crop at a friends house... He is moving in to a smaller place and wont have the room.. I quit growing at my house since my son was born 2 years ago..<br />
