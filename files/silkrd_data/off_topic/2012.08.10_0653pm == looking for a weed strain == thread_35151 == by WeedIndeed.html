				I&#039;m looking for a strain, preferably indica (unless sativas can stay as small as indicas?), that i can grow outside in the warm, humid climate of Israel. It has to be as small as possible but yield as much as possible, obviously.<br />Any suggestions?

				check out attitude seeds on the clearnet, they have a decent search facility which will allow you to search for a suitable strain based on your requirements.<br /><br />You should be aware that most indica strains will need more than 12 hours of light per day to grow properly, once they get 12 hours of darkness they will start to flower rather than grow in height. I say this because in Israel you will be on a 12/12 outdoor cycle by the end of September, if you got the seeds today, they would take 7 days to sprout and another week to get to about an inch or two, so you are looking at perhaps as little as 4 weeks vegging before they start to flower, this may be enough if you want to keep them particularly small anyway. alternatively look for a ruderalis strain, these are auto flowering strains that will flower after a certain length of time/period of growth. However they benefit from more light, they are usually grown where you dont get 12/12 outdoors until too late in the growing season, but they should still work for you. Of these the Lowryder and Lowryder2 strains are the best known and would probably suit you.
