				Shrooms didn&#039;t really work for me. I grew some Pan. Cams. a while back in hopes that it would do something, but they didn&#039;t really help. LSD sort of worked, stopped the headaches for a couple weeks.

				i was gonna recommend lsd, read an interesting article on the effectiveness, although only temporary unfortunately. very awesome to hear it stopped em for a bit at least. sorry to hear about your condition, i know it cant even adequately be described by horribly miserable. you should look into the non-psychoactive ergot compounds maybe? <br /><br />or you could just have a good excuse to keep a monster stash of high quality tabs and dose every month.

				I feel for you man, I hear those are the fuckingest worst pains of all right up there with being crucified.<br /><br />I recommend keep taking shrooms, a good dose once a week so as not to get tolerance, see if after six months you don&#039;t get lasting relief.<br /><br />MockFrog

				Used to have a girlfriend who had these all the time. <br />She popped ibuprofen like they were candies.<br /><br />Among the different types of sprays I gave her <br />was lidocaine nasal spray, sourced from USSR<br />which seemed to alleviate some of her symptoms<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve tried a few of the ergot derivatives and triptans that a doctor prescribed, all of them would work the first time and then never work again without doubling or tripling the dose. I just seem to have a major tolerance to things that affect the 5-HT receptors. I can take pretty heavy doses of most psychedelics and function at least semi-normally, most people consider me weird to begin with so they don&#039;t really notice if I&#039;m on something. :P<br /><br />Weed works sometimes, I can still tell I have a headache but it doesn&#039;t bother me as much. It is also good in that it lets me get some sleep without waking up every couple hours feeling like my head is going explode.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about the lidocaine nasal sprays but have never tried one.<br /><br />I just wish these damn things would at least go episodic instead of chronic. I&#039;ve pretty much had them daily for 5 years.
