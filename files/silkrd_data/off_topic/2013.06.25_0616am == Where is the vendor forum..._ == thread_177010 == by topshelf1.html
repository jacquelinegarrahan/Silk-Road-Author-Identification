				Of course there is such a thing...But it is highly guarded.<br /><br />You must contact Limitles tell him you got Code Nor2166om from the Rxking in the regular forum and that you want access to the vendor only forum. In order to get that access. You must prove you are vendor worthy! Not every vendor gets in...but once you do! Then things get exciting around here. This year i believe there is still the give away to the DPR block party. And I heard a rumor that DPR is giving away a weeks paid vacation in a tropical paradise (his words) he did it so successfully for his 420 campaign a couple years ago that he is bring it back for the vendor only summer nights spectacular. (there has already been let out of the bag..with the security breach on the roundtable..so there is no !need to hide it or deny it...it is true...I just wish people would quit trying to sneak in and see all that go&#039;s on there...it is a pretty big deal for a reason..and private for a reason. Respect the reason.<br /><br /><br />So message to Lim&nbsp; here---- (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/fa89fcfcd2..)&nbsp; and give him a link to this new thread and then give him the password and tell him RxKing gave it to you...it is here----<br /><br />&nbsp;password -- Nor2166om<br /><br /><br />He will then lead you on your way. Just remember to always tell the truth. And actually I will give you this to study...this is DPR himself speaking at the last meeting and he gave our this to the whole community.. You do not need to mesmerize the whole thing...but you&nbsp; must be able to know 1...that you can write and write fast. Here is what us vendors LIVE by-------- Good luck young man...very few get past the next step. Do not fall for the lies or the scams...Just go forward and try your best!!!!

				Thanks for that great reply Rxking...<br /><br />I do have a vendor account...under another handle of course...so when I heard about this vendor forum I started looking around for links to it...<br /><br />I just briefly scanned your very detailed instruction set and will study it in more detail...before&nbsp; giving it a shot...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Topper..
