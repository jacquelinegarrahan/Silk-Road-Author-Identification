				So I&#039;m looking to place an order with Delta11 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/0c12cbb477) who has some great bud listed that I REALLY want to try (GG and the Blue Maui). Currently have $29.29 in my account and the total amt for purchase would be $30 (this is all USD).. would anyone be willing to spare some change until Friday? I will pay you back in full with a little extra!<br /><br />TOTALLY APPRECIATE IT! <br /><br /><br />P.L.U.R.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I just wanted to come back and clarify I can pay back in full + extra on Friday because I have a pending withdraw via dwolla. The expected clear date is 4/9 before 5 CT. Thanks in advanced!! <br /><br />

				Im looking at mtgox and the price per btc is about $4.9 USD. I think that would be like .05 - .09 ish TOPS.. + the price fluctuates all the time. Thats my estimate..

				DUDE I cant thank you enough and I WILL pay you back! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU..<br /><br />Only one problem.. I must suck at calculations.. or the price/value has dropped (mtgox says 4.89usd per btc).. am I missing something here because your .08 deposit (which I really appreciate) only brought me up to 29.50. Is there a place to see what the value of BTC is in the SR market? I know there used to be a BTC value at the bottom of some pages but I no longer see that!<br /><br />Here is a screenshot of my profile page showing your deposit and and my current balance. <br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=3159f716b62494e8b0c7a5289ffef171.jpg<br /><br />So close yet so far. And yes.. thats Mr. Rogers!

				Dude just go to settings and change the currency from USD to BTC you should leave it that way as well. look at a vender and see how much his product cost in USD and then how much it cost in BTC just divide and you&#039;ll see what the rate is. It should be very close to MTgox value.
