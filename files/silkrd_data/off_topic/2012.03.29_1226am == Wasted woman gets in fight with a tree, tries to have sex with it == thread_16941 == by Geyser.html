				i was there for that..... it was absolutely ridiculous. it was a long road trip to Miami, but worth it to see flying lotus and a drunk teenager slap/fuck a tree. the best part was when her friends dragged her away. that is definitely the worst you wont believe what you did when you were drunk story.
