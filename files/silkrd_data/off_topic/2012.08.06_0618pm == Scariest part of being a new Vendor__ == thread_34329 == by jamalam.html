				I&#039;m not a vendor, but if were to become one I think the scariest/most paranoia-inducing part of the process would be driving round with loadsa parcels with illegal narcotics in, and posting them into post boxes... getting pulled over would completely fuck you over - &quot;personal use&quot; could definately not be blagged!<br /><br />Wondering what vendors would say about starting out from their personal experience?

				Just don&#039;t do anything that will get you pulled over man!<br /><br />I used to smuggle, I received product and delivered it, I didn&#039;t have anything else to do with either party, and the scariest part was giving the product to the receiving party and taking the money. I felt like the back of my head was in the crosshairs of a gun everytime I was walking away. It&#039;d be easy for someone to kill me and say I never showed up, allowing them to keep the product and money.<br /><br />I&#039;m out of that game now.

				No, but one time I was walking away and one of the guys (who all had guns, so I was already paranoid) starts yelling at me to come back, so I turn around, ready to bolt, and he just yells back &quot;Thanks bro, you&#039;re a half hour early, and we really appreciate that around here.&quot;<br /><br />I just waved and smiled weakly and said no problem. Friendly heroin drug lords, guess they do exist.

				If you find it scary then you are not cut out to do it. You have to be fine with what you are doing to be comfortable doing it and you have to be comfortable doing something to be successful at it.

If you&#039;re paranoid (beyond a healthy level) and nervous and scared all the time, you&#039;re gonna slip up and forget something. There&#039;s a thin but distinct line between being a little paranoid and paying close attention to detail, and being so paranoid that you fuck things up. And people need to know which side of that line they&#039;re on before they become a vendor.

				There shouldn&#039;t be anything &quot;scary&quot; about it. There might be some things that could make you slightly nervous in the beginning but after doing it for a while I&#039;m sure all of that goes away/is highly diminished. Weird you use the word &quot;scary&quot; to describe the feeling though. Seems like very childish diction. If you&#039;re not an adult (or at the very least mentally an adult) I don&#039;t recommend you pursue vendorship on SR. The worst possible feeling you should have as a vendor should be a healthy nervousness, not fright.

One thing about is you cant be on any drugs while driving / transporting packages from place to place. Dont drink, or get high or look suspicious in any way.&nbsp; <br /><br />&gt; have a valid drivers license <br />&gt; proof of insurance <br />&gt; no outstanding tickets <br />&gt; nothing &quot;funny&quot; or &quot;suspicious&quot; looking or smelling in your car. <br />&gt; make sure your tag isnt expired <br />&gt; make sure your turn signals work <br /><br />these are all basic things that get over looked, but when you change lanes and get pulled over b/c you have a tail light out, and it results in you getting searched ALL BECAUSE OF A DAMN TAIL LIGHT.... <br /><br />here is a story from last September <br /><br />DENVER (Reuters) - A routine Colorado traffic stop led to the discovery of 220 pounds of cocaine with a street value of $10 million in the rental car of a California couple, police said on Monday.<br /><br />Mark Bailey and Lisa Calderon, both of Sylmar, California, were arrested on Sunday in the southern Colorado city of Pueblo on suspicion of cocaine possession, Pueblo Deputy Police Chief Andrew McLachlan said.<br /><br />&quot;This is definitely the largest cocaine seizure in our department&#039;s history,&quot; McLachlan told Reuters.<br /><br />McLachlan said a patrol officer was tipped off by an off-duty detective to a car making an illegal lane change on Interstate 25, about 115 miles south of Denver.<br /><br />The north-south highway has long been a drug-smuggling corridor, he said. When the officer pulled over the rented Chevrolet Malibu, he discovered that Bailey&#039;s California driver&#039;s license had been revoked.<br /><br />Bailey, 37, told the officer he owned an auto body shop in California, and was en route to Iowa to look at a 1955 Chevy, police said.<br /><br />The officer became suspicious because when Calderon, 35, was questioned she appeared nervous. She said the pair were going to visit her brother in Iowa but couldn&#039;t say where, police said.<br /><br />When the officer noticed that the back of the car appeared to be weighed down, he summoned a drug-sniffing dog and its handler to the scene. The dog, name Raleigh, &quot;alerted on the rear of the Chevy,&quot; McLachlan said.<br /><br />A search of the trunk uncovered four black duffel bags stuffed with bricks of cocaine, and the pair was arrested, he said.<br /><br />Bailey was also cited for driving with a suspended license, and no proof of insurance.

				Damn, that&#039;s crazy. Dunno why you&#039;d transport that all in one car. Rule of thumb when transporting large amounts is break it up if you think it&#039;s too large for one shipment, at least when I was smuggling.

I&#039;m guessing u may have been &quot;hustling&quot; a little too &quot;hard&quot; mate&nbsp; ;D

				A nice clean rental car, with a runner with no previous history. Rarely go two up and certainly never three up or more. Plus we&#039;d never have two guys of different race in the car, (&quot;black and white, stop on sight&quot; is the old police saying, in the some of UK anyway). Don&#039;t have flashy cars with young drivers, basic really.<br /><br />A certain level of nerves is healthy if your looking at a lot of bird. I&#039;d be concerned about someone who wasn&#039;t worried about going down.
