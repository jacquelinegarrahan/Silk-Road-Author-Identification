				I was getting these pills (with different presses) for about a year in Australia that people were saying were Methylone but since buying some recently it was different.<br /><br />The effects were -<br />Feeling wide away with lots of energy<br />Not hugely euphoric<br />When i looked in the mirror with lights on my puplis were quite small (from memory)<br />Couldn&#039;t sleep for 24hrs<br />Strong sexual fantasies on come down<br /><br />The main reason I wanted this drug again was for the sexual fantasies... just awesome.<br /><br />Any idea what I was taking?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				That might be a very difficult puzzle to solve really.<br /><br />The main reason is that you cannot be certain these pills contained only one active substance. For example they could have contained a mixture of ephedrine and mdma - the first explaining the first 4 symptoms and the latter perhaps the sexual one. They could have been a mix of virtually any stimulant with a hallucinogen to produce a similar effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you still have any it might be possible to analyze them to get a clue what they actually contain, but otherwise it could be an endless search to find something with identical effects.
