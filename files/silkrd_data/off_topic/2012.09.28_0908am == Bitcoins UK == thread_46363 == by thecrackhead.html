				Guys is getting really frustrating, I honestly don&#039;t see why you don&#039;t want to share information.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying for few days now to get BTC in Uk, I did find few websites but I really don&#039;t know who to trust and I don&#039;t know if I will be anonymous in the process of getting them.<br /><br />The websites I found require way too much personal information. Why don&#039;t you just tell us (the newbies) how to do it, at the end of the day we all want the same thing (drugs).<br /><br />If the americans are willing to share information why are not the british doing it? Is it that hard to type in for 3 minutes?<br /><br />One of the options I&#039;m considering is getting them from the ventor btc4ukash but I don&#039;t know if he is a scammer.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.

				Well, here&#039;s my 2 pence buddy! Been floating around, reading for weeks and finally settled on this line of buying bitcoins. MtGox used to allow cash deposits from Barclays bank until recently, and that is what I was gonna do. Barclays have stopped this AFAIK. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve now decided to try this out. Buy a Ukash voucher from any PayPoint store (little yellow sign with PP entwined), take that voucher onto the CashU website and transfer it to them. Transfer it out of CashU, *EDIT* into bitcoinnordic and trade for BTC. After that i am gonna run it through at least 2 brand new Instawallets, then into SR.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Haven&#039;t started yet so don&#039;t take my advice as gospel, and aware that MtGox red flags Tor connections instantly so that should propably be your ONLY clearnet transaction. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope that helps dude!&nbsp; ;)

				I used to use MTGox by depositing cash into their Barclays account. Now that it no longer an option i was faced with finding a new method of obtaining bitcoins. After about half a days searching i decided to use Bitcoin Nordic hxxps://bitcoinnordic.com/index.html and use the cash in the mail method. I send my cash to them and im now just waiting to hear back from them. I&#039;ll let you know how i get on... im hoping to have those coins real soon.

				Dont use any sort of Bitcoin vendor, its risky and you are just asking to be scammed. Seriously the barclays pingit service is the way to go if you can familiarize yourself with the blockchain bitcoin wallet. Its actually pretty easy once you figure it all out, so i dont have to explain please see this thread :) http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45866.0

				There&#039;s the Barclays Pingit way with Blockchain, which is probably what I&#039;d recommend. <br /><br />On the other hand, you can use VirWox. This can all actually be done with a debit card/PayPal too, which makes things pretty easy. HOWEVER, the fees using this method are fairly hefty, and the process will still take a few days for whatever reason. I used to use this until I actually realized I&#039;m losing so much money on fees. <br /><br />Kind of blows how limited we are in terms of options in the UK, eh...

				Urgh, my god, I hadn&#039;t realised how bad it&#039;d suddenly got to get BTC in the UK. :( I haven&#039;t used Intersango for quite a while due to how anti-SR they were, and MTGox were fine only the other week. I haven&#039;t got a clue how else to get BTC now, and I&#039;m very hesitant to use anything involving sending money to an individual and letting them convert it.<br /><br />Hopefully one or both of them will get it sorted within the next couple of weeks... how long has Intersango not had a working UK account now?<br /><br />EDIT: this looks interesting: https://blockchain.info/wallet/deposit-pingit Unfortunately my phone is jailbroken and so the Pingit app won&#039;t work, but I could update to iOS6 for this, maybe. I shall have to think on it...

				Fuck that 15%. <br /><br /><br />Intersango is still working but you cannot put money in via a UK account. Polish people can get bitcoins so maybe ask one.<br /><br />Also, I had another account here (lost the pin and got robbed by Tony76 of 10 grams. My stupid fault for FE.<br /><br />I cannot beleives the price of the bitcoinz. Should have bought a lot more when they were under one pounds. But my coins is running out.<br /><br />Also lost some cash off some scammer in sending by post some cash. 250 vanished and the vendor also. <br /><br />I run some rigs but its not worth it and the grapgic cards are insane prices. OK if you have free electricity but the cost of electricity is more than making the bitcoins. Another 50, that is the end of making them unless I can buy real cheap cards.<br /><br />I got enough left to buy a weekend out.<br /><br />So the bitcoin stuasion is looking bad here even in Ireland which has fuck all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&gt;:(

				Ok so jail broken iPhone users who still want to use PingIt:<br /><br />I was looking at a cydia tweak called xcon that claims to overcome jailbreak blocking. It didn&#039;t work for me, but looking on line I found a suggestion to put my phone into safe mode.<br />After doing so the PingIt app works.<br />(I still have xcon installed; dont know if it is doing anything or not).<br />You can put your phone into safe mode through SBSettings or ( if you have latest mobile substrate) by holding volume up on reboot.<br />I havent actually used PingIt yet but it seems to be working. This seems the most versatile and cheapest way of getting BTC in UK at moment.

				Aaargh fuck I spoke too soon.... it lets you open the app and enter all your bank details etc but when it connects to verify your info it cottons on and fucks up. With one bank account it just freezes at &quot;submitting details&quot; with another it returns an error message &quot;this account cannot be authorized&quot; or some such. I presume it&#039;s detecting the jailbreak. I was going to try and find an earlier version of the IPA online but if it&#039;s checking online it&#039;s still going to rumble me.<br />I&#039;m pissed off as this seemed like the best way at the moment. Most other ways are going to involve high fees and several days wait. I&#039;m used to just transferring funds the same day.

				I went for the iOS6 upgrade and tried Blockchain&#039;s Pingit opton earlier. Holy SHIT, it was basically instantaneous - they say a wait of &quot;10 to 15 minutes&quot;, but for me it was really was a case of hitting send, getting the confirmation text from Barclays a few seconds later, and then hearing a &quot;ding&quot; from my browser window sitting on my wallet account after another few seconds.<br /><br />So I very much recommend going that route if you&#039;re able.

				So, with regards to my post about Bitcoin Nordic, I can safely say that the cash in the mail service works... I have my coins and I&#039;ve just made my 6th purchase! Yeah! The only thing that is bothering me is their 9% charge on top of the MTGox rate. My maths in shite to say the least... so does that mean they are charging 9% ON TOP OF the MTGox 15%?

Go to local bitcoin or trade bitcoin or bitcoin-otc to see how this works.<br /><br />I cannot understand how everybody seems to be using services which are difficult to anonymize e.g. ping-it, with major exchanges like MtGox and Intersango, which both have a history of fucking with SR users, which will hand over your details to LE in a shot. Ping-it use even means you&#039;ve given LE your mobile; thus your real time movements, and your address to which you&#039;ll doubtless be receiving illegal contraband.<br /><br />LE can make 1 simple request, and the bank manager will, at the end of each day, deliver all the people&#039;s names, mobiles and addresses. The incoming transactions to MtGox will then be filtered to find those transfers involving ping-it by examining the transfer reference codes. Bingo, we have most people using ping-it to obtain bitcoins. Then the LE lifts the phone again and passes the list to the postal inspectors. Now your packages go to secondary.<br /><br />Does anybody see a flaw in my logic here?<br /><br />Bottom line is: bitcoin is as anonymous as your entry and exit to and from the bitcoin network. If you can do that then you have physical anonymity (vendors can worry about the exit). If you then launder your bitcoins you obtain virtual anonymity on the block chain, making traffic analysis a dead end. If you use both, you are never going to get caught using bitcoins to buy contraband. You might get caught some other way, but not by the use of bitcoin.

				Pine that is largely very, very wrong. Lack of anonymity does not mean you are unsafe, and you can never be completely anonymous (and it has its drawbacks), and most importantly the police cannot do any of that. If you&#039;re the suspect of an investigation it doesn&#039;t matter how you buy your bitcoins, but you&#039;re not going to become a suspect just from buying them and I&#039;d feel safer buying them in a standard way amongst purchases from thousands of others than from an unknown dealer.

				This topic has been covered quite a few times, for example:<br /><br />&#039;Topic: GBP Deposits no longer accepted by MTGox....beginning of the end ?&#039;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45537<br />&#039;Topic: UK SR, where&#039;re you getting your BTC now that intersango&#039;s gone?&#039;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45332.0<br />&#039;Mt.Gox UK bank transfer address problem&#039;<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45478<br /><br />Why aren&#039;t we sharing information? I think we&#039;re just being British by having our stiff upper lips in check, or paranoid, or both. The best way to trade for BTC is with cold hard cash, I know this brilliant way, where this is possible, you&#039;ll receive your Bitcoins instantly (no waiting for days like MtGox and Intersango), and as your doing the transaction with cash, you&#039;ll have anonymous Bitcoins with very little taint. For those that either have a good post count or buyer stats (I don&#039;t mean to pry I just want my information to go into the right hands, and not have these methods taken away from us), just drop me a PM, and I&#039;ll point you in the right direction, this method is one of three ways I have, so you&#039;ll have plenty of options. I&#039;m doing this as my way of sticking up my finger to MtGox and Intersango, to keep business booming here, and I really like to genuinely help others if I can. Just for you to be sure, if you take a look here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45332.30 a few members with decent post counts, have said I helped them, and quite a few more have PMed me back to say that they&#039;re very pleased with the results. So if anybody needs a little assistance I&#039;ll be happy to help, simply send me a PM, and I&#039;ll do my best to assist :)
