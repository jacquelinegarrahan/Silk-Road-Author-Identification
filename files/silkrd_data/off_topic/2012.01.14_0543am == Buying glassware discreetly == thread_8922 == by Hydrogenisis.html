				Knowing that the DEA already watches purchases of chemicals, how would a cautious (read: paranoid) individual go about procuring laboratory equipment under the radar of the government? <br /><br />I was thinking about a legitimate dealer, or shop, craigslist is very spotty.<br /><br />Also of interest to those curious about the DEA&#039;s monitoring powers: http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/got-it-e-bay

				Was thinking of something more along the lines of an online supplier, perhaps overseas.

				I remember at age 16 buying glassware from an extremely well known lab supplier to &#039;home experiment&#039;.<br />Absolutely oblivious to such dangers as LE, my co-experimenter and I also bought H2O2, Nitric acid, H2SO4, fucking toluene and acetone in 2 orders from a smaller chemical company after Aldrich refused to let me set up an account. Had my mother ring up the chem supplier and amend an order. <br />Looking back, it&#039;s unbelievable that no legal problems came of it.&nbsp; :o

Just google it. Seriously. They have chemistry lab supply stores all over the place that require no ID, no special license, no forms to fill out, no way of tracing labware back to you... If they ask you&#039;re a freelance chemist! It isn&#039;t illegal to be a chemist :p<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have one of those shops, go to any one of your local walmarts and look in the kitchen section. Pyrex glassware is fantastic. Children&#039;s toystores also have chemistry sets with glassware included that is actually pretty quality.<br /><br />Hope this actually helps,<br /><br />DF<br />drugfather

				here is what swim would do&nbsp; :o<br /><br />if he has tried many UK chemical companies and failed so many times, sure you can always ring in and set up accounts but try ordering rare chems in one order or in a space of 2-3 orders (you will get clocked straight away)... Chemical companies want a VAT and company reg number, if your company hasn&#039;t been running for 5years+ most likely i&#039;m guessing they will deny your application.<br /><br />China and India is the place obtain everything. If you know how to import you will never have a sourcing problem.
