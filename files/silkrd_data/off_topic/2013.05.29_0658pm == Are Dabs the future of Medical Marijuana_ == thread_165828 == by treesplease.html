				Dabs are so potent I would think it would be what Medical Marijuana patients would need.<br />What do you think?<br />

				Unless you are a MMJ patient you don&#039;t know what you need. Everyone is different. Dabs will definitely become more popular but flower, edibles, tinctures, and other forms will never go away. Different ailments require different forms and doses of medicine. I would actually say that dabs are used more recreationally rather than anything medically applicable. But with that being said, dabs do have the potential to cause less harm as it is vapor and not smoke so it could be beneficial to someone who is not able to inhale many carcinogens. To answer your question - no, I do not think dabs will be &quot;the future&quot; of medical marijuana but rather that it will co-exist with every other form currently out there.

				Like HEATFan, it isn&#039;t the future, but it&#039;ll co-exist with a strong presence in the scene. A lot of people in my area have recently discovered what dabbing is all about... definitely picking up its pace as a popular trend.

				I&#039;m a long time stoner and over the last year quit smoking cigarettes and started vaping my green, recently I&#039;ve floated over to the Dab and i love it.

				No.&nbsp; Each patient doesn&#039;t need the same exact compounds from the cannabis to help them with their ailment.&nbsp; The future of medical marijuana is most definitely isolating the required compounds for individual patients.&nbsp; It also wont involve combustion.&nbsp; Most likely many different pills with different compounds from cannabis in each.

But I do use the volcano occasionally for dabs. There are two pads that come with the setup, one is like steel wool the other is kind of like spongy foam,&nbsp; these are their liquid pads. I tried the steel pad and it worked but not a lot of vapor. The spongy foam pad works great! Just rub a dab on it and load the chamber.&nbsp;

				Few people in my circle of friends starting getting vape pens and getting oils<br /><br />I would, but I can&#039;t find a good price on bulk for resale - and they buy less and less frequent. <br /><br />I personally enjoy the ritual and appreciation of flowers. Can&#039;t beat flopping a heavy bag of crystal covered nugs onto a table.&nbsp; <br />

				I agree with the great feeling of dropping a fat bag of nugs crystally and snowy nugs on the table or smacking someone with it. But I do have to say that these dabs ARE the future of medical marijuana. Due to the potency and the small amount that you need to relieve pain or whatnot.&nbsp; The methods of producing oil will only become easier and easier so everyone can use their bud to produce there own wax or oil.&nbsp; I cant wait for this day.&nbsp; The oil and wax pens are a good insight to what the future holds for dabs.

				i think dabs are the future of the coming generation. of course the old folks are never going to wanna put down the wonderful herb but the newbies getting high on dabs routinely starting out will make them not wanna smoke weed. just dabs ha. but there is so much money to be made with dabs. marketing and shit in medical states

				Nope, dabs will continue to get bigger and bigger for a while I think, but people aren&#039;t giving up their preferred methods ever. Just another route that will be best for some people.
