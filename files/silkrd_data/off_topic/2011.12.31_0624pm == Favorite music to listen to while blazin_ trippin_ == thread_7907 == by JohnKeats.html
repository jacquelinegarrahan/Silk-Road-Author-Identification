				The Contortionist is my favorite :) just about anything from their new album exoplanet, especially egress. i find that the whole progression from light jazz to chugging metal really intensifies psychedelic experiences.<br /><br />Thoughts? Favorite music?

				While smoking weed I&#039;m generally into the classic stoner stuff. For example, some reggae (especially underground reggae - a lot of the stuff produced by Lee &#039;Scratch&#039; Perry is brilliant). The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and the like are brilliant. Also some Marvin Gaye, BB King, Chet Baker and some blues/jazz/soul. There&#039;s a not-so-known Folk-Rock guitarist (who died in 2009 and since has became more and more famous) called John Martyn who&#039;s brilliant too.<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly inexperienced with hallucinogens, I&#039;ve tried a few but not many times. Mainly because they&#039;re hard to get hold of in my area though, with SR I&#039;ll probably be getting more into them. In my experiences, although it&#039;s the expected and some would say clich√©d album to listen to, The Beatles&#039; Sgt Pepper&#039;s Lonely Hearts Club Band is a brilliant album while tripping. Revolver too, I think it was John Lennon that said somewhere that Revolver was more the acid album and Rubber Soul more the cannabis album.

				King Crimson, Wishbone Ash, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Uriah Heep and Pink Floyd. When I&#039;m tripping with my noise-cancelling headphones on and listening to these guys, it&#039;s like every cell in my body is having synchronized multiple orgasms. Until, suddenly, I have no body and am launched into a higher dimension made entirely of good vibes and rainbows.

				I couldn&#039;t help getting on here and plugging my favorite band. Opeth is great when you&#039;re stoned although i can&#039;t say how great they are tripping. Especially their concept albums with lyrics to figure out all the growling. Next time i puff might try some Dream Theater and see how they sound.

				I think I like all you&#039;ve already mentioned but wanted to say I love two great albums which I fully understood only through drugs. I know it depends, we all have somewhat of different taste for music but yeah, I didn&#039;t really get these albums before acid experience. <br /><br />One is Animal Collective - Merriweather Post&nbsp; Pavilion, it&#039;s very good when you&#039;re peaking on like...4 or 5 tabs of acid (I mean, those SR tabs which are claimed to be around 80-100mcg). Especially I like side B on vinyl (Daily Routine &amp; Bluish) and definitely smoke some cannabis too while this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second is MGMT - Congratulations, its amazing, like full trip guide. Literally, if you&#039;re not experienced and feel that you need a sitter for your acid trip but can&#039;t find a one then this is it. It&#039;s not for the intense part of the trip but best thing you can do, is listen side A and B before peaking and then C and D when coming down. <br /><br />Didn&#039;t find any pictures of song descriptions on the backside of vinyl case but they are all like this one about the first song. -<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s Working: Love? Or Confusion? Reality? Contusion? Subterranea or Sub-fusion. The Quest begins.&quot;<br /><br />Definitely check this out, listen &quot;It&#039;s Working&quot; and &quot;Congratulations&quot; which are the first and last songs of the album. I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ll understand the album is a full trip by itself.<br /><br />Also, if you consume cannabis by eating and get more spiritual and peaceful high than by smoking then Congratulations is one of the best album through all the day. <br /><br />But yeah, there are lots of music and for me it&#039;s the one of the most interesting aspects to think or discuss when combined with psychedelic experience. <br /><br />And btw, Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues is pretty good a day after if you get that peaceful afterglow while sun is shining through you and by all that pure energy you just want to live and love.<br /><br /><br /><br />
