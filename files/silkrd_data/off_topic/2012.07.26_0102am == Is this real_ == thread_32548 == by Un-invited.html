				I&#039;ve read about that one. Isn&#039;t that the modded game where you get a ghost pokemon that is able to defeat any and all challengers, and then at the end you&#039;re forced to fight your ghost pokemon? And you always lose?

				It&#039;s not real. You&#039;re actually dead. The drugs were poison and they killed you and you&#039;ll be stuck thinking you&#039;re in a mushroom trip for all eternity.
