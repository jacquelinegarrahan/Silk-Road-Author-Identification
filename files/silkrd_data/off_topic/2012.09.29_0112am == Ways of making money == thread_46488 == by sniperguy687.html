You&#039;d be a very interesting and entertaining person to sesh with, I think your cool.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Why not become a Mystery Shopper? Your job would be to drop in unnanounced in shops and resturants and rate your experience. You send in your feedback, you&#039;ll be paid for your time and reimbursed for any purchases you made. You get paid between £50-£100 plus your purchases, so it&#039;s easily possible to double your wage to £100-£200 (in the UK, I&#039;m unsure about what other countries pay for this, but pretty sure the USA, Canada, Aus, New Zealand, Germany, Netherlands etc would offer something similar), plus (this is the cheeky cherry on top!) you&#039;ll get a meal and a night in a nice hotel thrown in for good measure. Pretty good going, I&#039;d say, if you&#039;ve got spare time, don&#039;t mind to travel, and are the kind of person that likes to share your opinions ;)

				I have found that the nbomes are really affordable but it takes time to get people on to them in your area unless they already know about them. The blotter tabs have worked good for me but the powder, well people are afraid of it because of people using so many different kinds of powder to spike a drink and so forth so if you pull an unknown powder out in a bar room type environment then people get all weirded out and paranoid but yea with the blotters I just tell people the truth and they see me do it so they want to try it. I have turned a lot of people onto the powders using that method and they love it. But yea you got to get out and party with them to get the ball rolling on something that is unknown about but that&#039;s how you do it. You could be buying sheets and selling 5 and 10 hits at a time before you know it.<br /><br />A lot of research chemicals are out right now and they are fairly cheap. Molly is a lot cheaper from here then in my area. People here will pay 20 bucks for a .1 and the pills are like 25 bux each. To find a real deal you have to scroll the forums and pay attention to some keywords in the titles of the topic threads. Check out the product offers page often. Every now and then someone will post a deal that&#039;s unbelievable
