				I have seen multiple mentions of the underground wiki that acts as a gateway/list for a lot of tor services.&nbsp; However the link that is commonly found with these mentions does not work.&nbsp; Does anyone have the current link to the underground wiki?&nbsp; Also are there any other tor sites you guys like that are worth checking out?&nbsp; I&#039;m not interested in CP or guns or anything too scary.&nbsp; Just interested in learning more about the darknet/deepweb and what it contains.<br /><br />

				It is a wiki and so gets edited a lot to direct people to phishing sites, be VERY wary of going anywhere that you find from there. Here are a few from my link collection:<br /><br />core.onion - eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion/&nbsp; &nbsp;Index in the same vein as Underground WiKi<br />BMR - 5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php&nbsp; &nbsp; Similar idea to SR but nowhere near the volume of traffic<br />UMB - 4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion/snapbbs/1b82f13e/threadlist.php?&nbsp; &nbsp;Another market type site<br />

The main address is: http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />But I couldn&#039;t get that one to load.
