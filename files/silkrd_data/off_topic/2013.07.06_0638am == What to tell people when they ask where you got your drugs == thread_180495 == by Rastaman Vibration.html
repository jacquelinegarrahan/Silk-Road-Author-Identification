				So people in my circle are starting to take notice of my seemingly endless supply of amazing drugs. They keep asking me where I got it from and if I can connect them to this mystery dealer.<br /><br />So far I&#039;ve been playing it cool and I haven&#039;t told anyone where I&#039;m really getting my goodies from, but lying to people is starting to get old.<br /><br />I&#039;m not really planning on spilling the beans or anything (I say stuff like, &quot;I have connections&quot; or &quot;I can&#039;t tell you who I got it from, I don&#039;t think they&#039;d appreciate that&quot;, etc), but I was just wondering what other people say.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Maybe joke that your life would be at risk if you said anything, and say the same thing every time they ask.<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t there a saying like if you keep telling someone the same lie, over and over again, they will believe it in the end.. think it was related to Hitler.. meh

Seeing the ensuing dumbfounded reactions is always entertaining. And then there was that one guy who immediately assumed I ordered things from SR after we met. But as for my close friends that already knew about SR, I tell them the truth. They&#039;re a little jealous of me because they&#039;re in situations where they can&#039;t safely receive packages/still don&#039;t know how to get bitcoins.

				Just say you steal them - and that you&#039;ve already told them too much. (If you really want to keep them from pestering you, just look nervous telling them this &amp; hint at your life being in danger if you were ever discovered). ;)<br />&nbsp;

				I sure as fuck don&#039;t talk to very many people about dope. My close friends who I partake with, or who I confide in, know better than to ask questions. Maybe it&#039;s a generational thing, but I&#039;m in my 30s and don&#039;t shoot the breeze about serious stuff for any reason.

				I really don&#039;t think that telling people that you get your gear in the mail is wise really, even if you come across as joking.<br /><br />Best thing is to be pretty guarded full stop. Don&#039;t let people be aware that you have good connects unless they really need to know, don&#039;t brag about your stash! If you get questioned about it just go with the &quot;I can&#039;t possibly tell you / I&#039;d be scared to reveal that&quot; type responses, and then change the subject.<br /><br />Tell one or two people that you buy from here then human nature dictates that many more will soon know. <br /><br />Loose lips sink ships.&nbsp; Be safe.

				Be careful as &#039;circles&#039; don&#039;t mean friends, plus people talk so tell one person then next thing half the town/village area knows!<br /><br />When younger you will be free about drugs with lots of people. If using, it usually does not matter. But if you resell anything here then your already known as a dealer and in my book, you really do not want to do that. <br /><br />I&#039;ve bought online for years. Way before SR we had clearnet site, hidden, that pretty much were cannabis shops. Eventually, more dealers went online, in particular younger dealers who were tech savvy and preffered the anon status of selling online. <br /><br />My friends buy online also. For some things, bud, we don&#039;t need to as it all over the place. A buyers market in some ways. Even getting cheaper as we move away from kids selling an oz for 500 UK pounds. (in deals) <br /><br />So my answer is that your drug use is your private concern. If you advertise the fact your using top quality everything people will talk. <br /><br />By the way, stashing drugs in a laptop is not the best idea as if anyone got busted for some order via mail then its likely the cops would take computers for forensic investigation. <br /><br />Read a good home stashes book. You got a lot of places to hide stuff in any home. Under the floorboards is 1970s. Gardens offer a great oppertunity to simply places a sealed plastic pipe into the ground, lower the stash bags. seal it with a screw on top and wrap in plastic. Put that under a plant or something. Make sure its in a blindspot. I know dealers who stashed in the garden only for someone to be peeping and for that stash to vanish. <br /><br />Drugs are your concern. I don&#039;t advertise but naturally, pot smokers do seem to be drawn to each other. In work, we wait to check out any new guys or girls. Some people I keep my drug use hidden 100%. A few friends, they are here anyway on SR and other sites and even still on the clearnet as its easy to blend in with legit sellers, even sell legit stuff, but always be there for the &#039;real&#039; customers who in some cases, have well over a decade os being on that customer list. You can pay via paypal for a few dozen garden gnomes. Maybe one of them may have something inside. <br /><br />Most dealing is done clearnet. The journalists cannot join those so they come to sites like this. Maybe they might like to tell me that passing on med cannabis to cancer sufferers is wrong? <br /><br />And people having fun on substances less dangerous than alcohol are all bad?<br /><br />The hypocrisy of drug laws knows no bounds, which is why you ought to say to yourself, &quot;who actually NEEDS to know were I get my drugs or even if I use?&quot;<br /><br />Need to know.<br /><br />That is why DPR is free and why many dealers are currently not free and in jail.<br /><br />So, my advice is NEED TO KNOW.<br /><br />And discretion helps. Wipe that powder off your nose for example!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				For the last fifteen years I have had access to almost any drug and anyone who knew I had/sold drugs knew that so they never questioned me.&nbsp; Someone I know found Silk Road last year and told me that they know where I&#039;ve been getting my drugs for a decade.&nbsp; I thought it was down right hilarious that they thought I have been buying drugs on Silk Road for a decade. ;D&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally never bought anything from here. ;D

				Hmm.&nbsp; They could be inquiring so they can get established themselves.&nbsp; Then again, I get immediately on guard when people ask questions like that.&nbsp; I hardly ever run into that one because most people know better, but when I have I just say &quot;why are you asking me that?&quot; Then they&#039;ll say &quot;oh, I was just wondering&quot;&nbsp; Then I carry on like nothing is amiss while not trusting them and devising plans to cut them out of the circle.&nbsp; Then if they try bringing new faces around, they are really out.

				Haha no it&#039;s not don&#039;t be so silly im facilitating them getting more smashed from a better quality product thus doing less harm to their bodies and all at a cheaper price (and most of them cannot get the drugs i sell elsewhere) so you&#039;re saying its wrong to make money off my friends for providing a decent service and risking my own money not to mention freedom to provide it and the fact that i do make money off them turns them in to clients not friends ? well i have clients but i dont hang with them, get smashed with them or act like the crazy weird fool that i am in front of them, i reserve that for my amigos (who by the way know roughly how much i make off them and are more then happy about it) they always get free testers and cheaper drugs so everyone&#039;s a winner. When i go round to buy weed i dont ask them where they got it/how much they paid for it, they give me a decent deal BECAUSE they are my friend.<br /><br />Simply put its my job and they choose who/where to buy their drugs from so why not line a mates pocket instead of a dealer u hardly know ?
