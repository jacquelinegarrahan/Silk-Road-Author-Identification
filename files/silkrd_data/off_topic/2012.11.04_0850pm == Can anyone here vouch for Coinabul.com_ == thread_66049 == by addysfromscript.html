				I recently saw coinabul mentioned on the forums (btc=&gt;bullion). I checked it out and it looks like they have very reasonable prices for bullion. Would anyone who has ordered from coinabul care to share their experience?

				They have been absolutely awful in my experience.<br /><br />I placed an order in early October .. still hasnt shipped. Lousy small piece too.<br /><br />Everytime I email them, they say &quot;this week it will ship&quot; .. 3 straight weeks.<br /><br />This service is too good to be true .. trading BTC for real gold bullion for minimal fees ? Glad I didnt place a large order.

				I bet he waits till the price gets lower to buy. That&#039;s disappointing, but it&#039;s still probably cheaper than the cashing out or bullion services on here. I wouldn&#039;t mind waiting.

				yeah it is starting to get alot of good reviews .. so I think these delays will only get worse. <br /><br />it is a tremendous service in principal ... its gonna be absolute smashed by people looking for anonymous cashouts though.

				My 20g piece arrived today ... but I was greeted with a rude welcome at the door as I owed $198 in duty to get my package. They do inform you there could be import fees, so its something I was kind of prepared for. $200 is steep though lol.<br /><br />Canadian customers should factor that into their price<br /><br />30 days from order placement to arrival ... 110BTC + $198 for 20g of gold. 20g of gold at spot is worth $1202 today.<br /><br />110x10.55 = $1379 for $1202 worth of gold.

				I dont know ... depends what you can resell the gold for I guess. And depends what your time frame is for the cashout.<br /><br />If its a long term investment, I guess turning BTC into Gold for 13-15% is a good deal.<br /><br />

				So, you did try them out Fred. I was wondering what their turn around time was going to be. Guess I&#039;ll have to keep looking to find something more reliable when I lose my private dealer which will be happening soon.

				@MtlJohn - Yeah that was my plan ... there is tons of places around here that are currency exchanges/metals buyers .. owned by all sorts of nationalities and they dont ask shit. If they did start holding the gold on site, they would be a much better service<br /><br />@spacecase - yeah i gave them a go, I expected more but I am glad to have got the gold safely. They didnt dodge emails, they werent dishonest and the duties thing is listed right on their site. I just didnt like the timeframe

				No... not coinabul........<br /><br /><br />there is a new site underway..... a little birdie told me so.... they are based in canada and not connected to coinabul..<br /><br />They are already in the gold business and from what I hear have gold on hand... no need for them to have to sell the coin first, then go buy the gold, then ship the gold like coinabul does!<br /><br />I&#039;m sure within a few weeks you will see the link around here... just keep looking!
