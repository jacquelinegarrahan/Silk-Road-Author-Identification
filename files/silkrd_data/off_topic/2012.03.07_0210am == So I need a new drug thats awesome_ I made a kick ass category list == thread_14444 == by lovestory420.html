				<br /><br />hey im pretty bored with my drugs (mdpv), adhd meds, valium/klonopin... and mxe and 2ce. I am looking for few types of drugs i made categories for :D. If u dont want to read it all just list one of your personal favs and why?But the categories are somewhat amusing and if we got a lot of posts this would be super helpful thread even if one person only new something cool for only one category I&#039;d like to hear about it.. Thanks guys and gals. Keep on keepin on :)<br /><br />Category 1: &#039;Holy shit I have so much work to do and I have classes tomorrow too how will I ever do both and fucntion??&#039; -- something where you can stay up all night working productivily and then be able to redose the next morning and go to class happy and ready to go and not shaking like a meth head. Ive done this with adhd meds and mdpv unnoticed, wndering if any other drugs can do this too<br /><br />Category 2: &#039;It&#039;s been a long day, lets chill out and feel overwhelmingly happy&#039; this would be for weekdays mostly. i used to do this with weed but i DO NOT want to smoke anymore of anything. This could be a stronger drug, im just looking for like not sleepiness but really content and happy end to a long day... This could last like only 1 hour. It would probably be a waste to last more than 4 hours as i would need to sleep at some pointtt. MXE is good for this.. but last time I did mxe was awful i got really sick and then threw up on low dose and its not the first time ive gotten dizzy/nauseous from it<br /><br />Category 3: &#039;its the weekend and I have a night that I can get completly fucked and or stay awake all night&#039; this is where i would put any long lasting awesome drugs if u know any, or stuff where for the peak or whatever you cant be around someone or they know ur zonked. But only at peak... not 10 hours of being&nbsp; fucked up.. unfortunately i think 2ce could do this to me? Btw anyone know oral dose of 2ce in a capsule? Also MXE is good for the &#039;getting completely fucked up&#039; part of this but often makes me sleep pretty soon.<br /><br /><br />END: Does MDMA Make you nauseous? If it has the risk or side effect I can&#039;t do it because i tend to get this side effect a lot. Also curious in coke, but not sure its worth expense and crash has been known to be bad and i need to be a functional person i cant take a day off work or an exam<br /><br />*WITH ALL THIS BEING SAID I MUST EMPHASIZE I CANNOT DO SOMETHING THAT WILL PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR PHYSICALLY CRIPPLE ME IN A WAY THAT I CANNOT GO TO WORK OR CLASSES ON A DAILY BASIS*

				I read that MDMA was very acidic and can cause stomach upset. So before my rolls I take 2 chewable pepcids and the stomach is fine. I wouldn&#039;t count on being able to go to class or work the morning after, even with a preloading regimen I&#039;m pretty tired the morning after. Though I&#039;m probably a wee bit older than you are, lol.

				for no 1 nothing will even come close to modafinil, it kicks ritalin or amphetamines into a tin hat any day of the week, its not really a substance to enjoy, its a substance to get things done, they give this stuff to chopper pilots in the military when theyre flying long missions to keep them alert and responsive, it also improves memory retention, as far as a &quot;smart drug&quot; goes its the best there is by a hell of a long way<br /><br />for no2 sadly with weed cut out and you already on the benzos there is only one other really stoning drug and thats opiates, but i recommend being very very careful mixing opiates and benzos, if at all possible do one or the other as you can die from the combined respiratory depressant effects (also both are very addictive so be prepared for that) you could consider cannabis edibles or a vaporizer too, its probably a better option than the opiates.<br /><br />no 3. first off 2c-e should be between 10 and 15mgs if you have no tolerance. and as for the rest lets start with the pick of the bunch LSD, then 2C-B which i rate over 2C-E any day of the week as it has much less body load and nausea potential, MDMA, mushrooms for starters<br /><br />and the final part mdma can make you nauseous in higher doses, i often puke towards the end of a heavy roll, but thankfully it never feels bad if that makes any sense, it happens rather quickly and you feel just fine after emptying out a bit, chances are 2C-E will be much more likely to make you vomit than MDMA

				I throw up everytime I take MDMA, apparently it&#039;s a reaction some people have. I wouldn&#039;t really classify it as nausea though... I get a couple minute warning that I&#039;m going to puke, and that gives me enough time to get to a bathroom in pretty much any situation. It&#039;s not something I&#039;ve ever been able to fight down, but honestly as soon as I just let it happen I feel like a million-fucking-dollars. I&#039;m going to try that tip about the pepto-bismol though next time, hopefully it&#039;ll help!

				Cat1: take 4-fa mixed with Proprananol (make your brain work better, clearer and have energy)<br />Cat2: Ghb or any mild opioid (maybe hydrocodone)<br />Cat3: DMT, all the way<br /><br /><br />BTW, yes some people get VERY sick on MDMA, most dont.<br />Also, coke is not really very fun, and it&#039;s WAY expensive. After seeing scare-face I was like &quot;OMG, I must try this wonder drug&quot; but it&#039;s not really great at all.

				I dont understand why you don&#039;t want to smoke anything.&nbsp; Weed is your safest and most useful bet out of everything people have suggested.
