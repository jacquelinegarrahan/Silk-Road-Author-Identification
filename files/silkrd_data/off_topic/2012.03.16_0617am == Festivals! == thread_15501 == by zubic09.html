				Bloc was fucking mental last year, such a good line up (AFX, Four tet, LFO...), and without a doubt the most substance filled festival ever. Within 10 minutes me and a mate were taken to a room with everything you could ever wish for! We ended up rolling for 20hrs straight<br />Hoping to go this year too.<br />Reading doesn&#039;t look too good.<br />Dot to dot is on now I think...

				Glade, Relentless Nass, Global Gathering, Creamfields and Bestival.<br /><br />Could do with some tips on sneaking in drugs, Creamfields is the one I want to be really cautious at. Currently debating buying a multi-pack of crisps, opening them up, taking them all out and then putting everything into the packet at the bottom and then re-sealing it with an iron. Then just placing all the crisps back in and sealing up the multi-pack with the iron again. My only worry about doing this is that if i was searched and/or a sniffer dog found something it&#039;s be totally out of my control. Atleast if I had it down my boxer/briefs there&#039;s still i chance I could pop it up there worst case scenario

				Yeh I&#039;ve been to Outlook. Croatia has very tough drug laws but as with most European countries they tend to turn a blind eye to discreet personal drug use. You&#039;ll be okay on the festival site but don&#039;t take the piss, especially off-site. I&#039;d be suprised if you could get GHB there. <br /><br />Not implying you&#039;re that sort of person but contrary to the assumptions of a lot of US gap year students that I&#039;ve met in the Balkans, Croatia isn&#039;t a third world country and you can&#039;t get out of legal tight spots by chucking a small amount of Kuna at the police...

				I am definitely going to Wakarusa this year, and possibly Harvest if I have the funds.<br /><br />Anyone who can make it to Wakarusa should check out Easter Island next year.

				Well this is my first post outside of the welcome forum. Finally joined last week on 420 and how fitting. Now lets get on with festivals.<br /><br />This years Festivals i have on my list right now is EDC Vegas, Electric Forest, at least two ID Festivals,&nbsp; Electric Zoo and maybe a couple others thrown in there as well and i am hoping i don&#039;t miss Holy Ship again. Also hoping sensation will announce there U.S. dates soon.<br /><br />Now about my experience with past festivals in the U.S. <br /><br />Last year i did ultra, electric forest, and 3 Identity festivals. <br /><br />Okay the vibes i have notice over the last five years East coast, Mid West/Central, West Coast<br /><br />East Coast- I have never been a fan of the east coast vibes. I feel like it has way to many meat heads involved and it is a lot more of a Bro kind of thing. People are very disrespectful weather it is a show or a festival. If you bump into someone they are more about saying fuck you why did you do that. There are friendly people but most of the people there are manly there for just for the drugs. Now don&#039;t get me wrong i love my drugs but it is more then just the drugs to me i love the music i love the social interactions and i love the experience that the event has via piro, lights, stages, and rides if any. Also from my experience i have notice a lot more bunk ass drugs all over the east coast at festivals. I have had many first timers ask me questions when they find out i sell and it is scary the things they take not knowing what they are getting so i am always happy to educate others when in the field. <br /><br />Mid West/Central- A lot more laid back then the east coast. Always pretty good vibes from all event goers. A lot of good bud but it is hard to find a lot of good drugs by the time they hit there they are pretty stomped on so you might be getting something that at one time was good but it normally has to go through so many hands to get to these areas it normally isn&#039;t that good. Festivals though are a good place to come across good stuff. A lot more people here are looking to have good times. So many good small and large festivals through out the Midwest that i don&#039;t think get enough recognition.<br /><br />West Coast- God west coast is like a melting pot of everything. So many good vibes though and good people. Always been a good drugs and they are always pretty easy to get your hands on when at festivals. The EMD scene has been around for ever so there are a lot more ravers and plur kids on the west coast. Also i think a lot more time and planning go into festivals on the west coast and they real strive to give you that all around amazing time at a festival. <br /><br />Ultra is awesome if you can get past the east coast vibe. Be very careful if you sell at here. They bust a lot of people her and when they do they give you options on whether you want to go to jail or be a nark. They also have a lot of actual narks that are out in the crowds. You can normally spot them pretty easily. One of my biggest bitches about ultra is there water situation. They never have any place to fill up at. Getting drugs in can be pretty easy if you are smart about it. they do a pretty good job at pat downs and going through your belongings.<br /><br />Electric Forest- Probably the best festival I have ever been to so this review is going to be very long. If there is one festival that you have to go to this is it. The campground are amazing and so many good vibes, you can get your hands on anything there and you can bet it will be very pure. If you are selling do all of your selling in the campgrounds. Last year i didn&#039;t hear or see anyone getting busted on the campgrounds. Now in the festival that is a different story besides weed, weed is legal in Michigan and as long as you have the proper documentation they don&#039;t care that you smoke. If you don&#039;t have your papers find someone that does and smoke with them. I meet a grower last year that kept smoking me out and any time the cops walked by just handed it off. About the COPS they are very friendly and if you are fine with them they are fine with you don&#039;t&#039; act suspense and they wont bother you. I spent a lot of time rolling balls and tripping shooting the shit with the cops in the forest and talking about the festival. They are there for your safety and not once did i ever see them abusing there power. There are a lot of cops so just be wary. Now the festival ground are amazing. It is just a long on going place. There isn&#039;t any sound that bleeds over from the other stages because they are so spread out and there are woods between all of them. They have put a lot of time and money into this place and it is rented out by a very awesome family and it is there land so be very respectful of the land. In the forest there are all kinds of art sculptures and tripy lights for your enjoyment along with hundreds of hammocks provided by the festival but people do bring there own as well. I am sure if any of you are there i will see you there because i will be selling MDMA from Germany, Kitty powder(hopefully be able to get my hands on pharmaceutical grade liquid still capped but i haven&#039;t talked to my seller in a while now), will have ganja treats, boomers, and LSD and probably NO for friends. Now back to the festival The weather last year was perfect besides the first night we had a gnarly lightning storm that delayed the festival. Waking up it is nice and there is always a nice breeze so make sure to bring warmers clothes for the night time and plenty of blankets. WOW i have gone on but i guess i could still go on about how amazing this festival is. There is a good vibe here and good music for all sort of different tastes in music. <br /><br />Bonnarro- Awesome festival and awesome vibes from everyone. They always put on a good festival. Now this is more of a one and done festival for me. WAY WAY WAY TO FUCKING HOT in the summer. It is almost impossible to even try and sleep because it is so warm. A lot of good drugs and a lot of good drugs. Make sure to stay hydrated because it gets so fucking hot in the covered stages. A lot of cool are installations to look at.<br /><br />EDC- I have not been to Vegas yet so i will have to report back but from what i have heard i hear it was a good move for EDC to leave LA. It used to be a bitch to try and go to different stages because it was such a cluster fuck and fuck trying to get out of the Colosseum or even getting in. Lot of good drugs went around when in LA. There was a lot of narks and cops but as long as you are stupid about it you would be fine. SO MANY FUCKING HOT GIRLS. if you want skimpy clothes and chill people looking to have a good time and listen to amazing EDM music this is the festival for you. Hands down the BEST EDM festival in the country. Insomniac knows how to put on a fucking show. They know what they are doing and they have been doing it for over 10+ years now. All kinds of amazing art installations, there stages are amazing and they put a lot of money into them. All kinds of fun rides for when you want to take a break from the music. Also they proved free wanted that you can refill you Insomniac water bottle with(now that is awesome nothing is more important then the water). They always bring in the best EMD artist ever-year. Can&#039;t wait to go to this years and this will be my first time in Vegas so it is going to be a damn good time. <br /><br />My fingers are going but there is a few reviews on some U.S. festivals. But much love and respect. Be smart and you will stay out of jail and always have respect for others there.

I&#039;ve been interested in that kind of thing, especially in my area. <br />Going to raves in town its crazy seeing how many people are uninformed about the drugs they think they&#039;re taking...

				^I&#039;ve seen that as well, which is why I try to avoid buying anything at events. On a contradictory note the best molly I have ever had I picked up from a random dude at bisco but yeah test kits are a must when buying from random people at festivals.

Waka was amazing last year and I am pumped to trip at Electric Forest<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />See you at Waka brother! What shows you hitting at Red Rocks? I got a few buddies who are probably gonna check out the Further shows. I would loove to go to String Cheese but I&#039;m going to see The Wall in Denver in a couple weeks, then Waka, a small festival, and All Good, so i&#039;m pretty packed for now<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />STS9 and Pretty Lights at Red Rocks. Waka should be awesome, last year was hot as fuck so we got a camper this year. String cheese is playing like 3 sets at electric forest I think. I am so pumped for festival season!!!! I just placed my first round of SR orders today, couple different bags of molly and some dmt. I had bought a test kit this year and was going to rely on that for festivals but after finding SR I figured I would just stock up and not bother with the whole drug scene at the shows.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, i found some good molly last year for a good price, but it definitely wasn&#039;t Dutch crystal. <br />I can&#039;t wait to see Bob Weir and Primus and Waka<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>They will both be awesome and pretty lights will be good for rolling there. I got ripped last year on just about everything. Of all things I got that was legit was DMT, same dude sold me bunk acid but makes me think it might have been the humidity that ruined it since the dmt was dank. My stats on molly were 1/3. All I can say to everyone is TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUNK PD if you haven&#039;t. They will be at most festivals this year and will test your stuff for free. They usually have a booth.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can you link me to some info about this Bunk PD?? I would love to apart of something like that! Is it legal to test people&#039;s drugs at a festival in America??<br />I would totally bring my test kit and test stuff for people!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just look into it on google. I looked into working/volunteering for them at festivals this year but decided against it because I would rather enjoy drugs myself and test them for friends and neighbors. The owner told me that they don&#039;t handle the drugs, sounded like they hand you a platter to hold and tell you to drop a sample on there then they drop the reagant so they never actually handle the drug. He said that they have had, overall, good reactions from local LE that understand they are doing harm reduction. They have been around for 2 or 3 years I think.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah i googled it, I&#039;m looking into and it seems awesome. I got my test kit off of Dancesafe.org and I know they do similar things. I&#039;m gonna send em an email and see what i can do. I&#039;ve been interested in that kind of thing, especially in my area. <br />Going to raves in town its crazy seeing how many people are uninformed about the drugs they think they&#039;re taking...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>yeah it&#039;s sad really. I stood by the bunk pd booth last year at waka for like a whole afternoon and I would say that 85% of the drugs if not more where not what the user thought they were. 90% of those times the users had no idea that there were such drugs as things like mephedrone and shit, they would find out they don&#039;t have coke, molly, or lsd and assume it was just bunk. Then they find out it&#039;s 25i or methylone or dimethocaine and they are just flabbergasted. I saw a lot of people act like they were never going to do drugs again after finding out the shit they were taking. <br />I saw a ton of people that thought they had the best molly at the fest and found out they had straight amphetamine and rc&#039;s<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Where was that booth at?? I definitely woulda been hanging out there had i known about it. That sucks tho! My friends brought some blotter from town that ended up being DOx, but they didn&#039;t want to believe me when i told them..Guess who ended up being the only one sleeping that weekend?<br /><br />But i got some Mushroom chocolates that were solid, and my buddy had some 2c-b that was alright, i traded it for some molly that i bought there, so it probably wasn&#039;t too good haha<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about bringing my test kit to festivals..

				bringing your test kit is so worth it. You almost don&#039;t have to bring it, just say you have one when a dealer comes up, if they say they are ok if you test it that usually means they are at least confident in their product. Not saying that means it&#039;s good though cuz like I said, especially with molly, I have met TONS of people that think their shits good and it is a total mixed bag of rc&#039;s. The stand last year was only up for a day and a half, friday night and all day saturday if I remember right, in the merch area of campgrounds. I agree with zubic on the fact of the best molly I ever had was from some shady dude at a small show but I have also had some terrible nights and probably really hurt my brain from some of the shit people have sold me. If your going to waka or forest and need any super potent 2c&#039;s just mention my name and i&#039;ll hook you up.

Look out for security if your just selling a few ten bags they arnt gonna be to bothered there looking for the people shifting major weight.<br />If you are going to sell at a festival then be on your toes BIG TIME don&#039;t smoke, sniff anything you need to be alert. But if your going there just to have fun then just go with the flow, take it case by case. But remember to Look out for yourself! there are ALOT of bad people who go to festivals.

				Anyone reading these forums already has an alternative to being ripped off at festivals by the myriad of rats who basically live off the happiness of others - knowing many will have their guard down,<br /><br />I hate festival thieves. I know in my area there are some who travel to festivals basically to steal. For this reason - don&#039;t bring anything expensive. No need for designer clothes and expensive jewellry. Be aware that every scammer in a 100 mile radius will like head to a good festival just to rip people off.<br /><br />Best tactic is to buy what you need well in advance. For the average festival my main stash is hash. I avoid bud as its so obvious and can be smelt by an undercover cop in the next county!<br /><br />I think MDMA is a must have. why risk getting some god awful rubbish when MDMA here is priced at most around £4 per 100mg. <br /><br />Speed also has its moments. Very few moments actually as the pay back for speed is the main reason most will not use! <br /><br />A bit of cocaine for a festival - well, wjo would not say no to quality beak? Finding it is another thing. But if you have access or have found a good dealer here then coke would be the ideal drug to take so as to save redosing on MDMA.<br /><br />Mushrooms - I like to collect the UK natural harvest of our infamous shrooms. Every autumn I try to collect a little supply. Having dried shrooms ready to make a pot of tea fo friends is another night entertainment, Great for the 2.00am come downs - classic festival drug that is made better when you have trusted friends with you..<br /><br />you can always eat some hash also. Its great! Eat 1 gram you at a certain level =- eat two its better - three grams of good hash is not far off tripping but mind and actually longer. Everyone ought to eat hash at least once.<br /><br />I never deal at festivals but often have enough stash to help out a fellow festival goer. <br /><br />I like to dance with women - my women knows this and its all just the spirit of the thing.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the festivals to start.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				I haven&#039;t many drugs at shows, but i&#039;ve bought a few times.<br /><br />When i do sell, i strike up a conversation with someone, after knowing their not LE or a shady dude i&#039;ll offer whatever I&#039;m selling.<br /><br />If someone comes up to me asking i&#039;ll say &quot;my friend might have some extra&quot; and strike up a conversation, after confirming their not LE or a shady dude ill tell em ill be right back and then i come back an sell em whatever.<br /><br />I try to make it seem like I&#039;M not the dealer, i try to make it seem like i have a little extra, or &#039;my friend back at camp&#039; has a little extra.

I met a guy last night looking for molly, he was a really cool dude, knew his stuff about the various analogues sold as &#039;molly&#039;, so it felt good to hook up a cool guy with some awesome MDMA who will know the difference between good stuff and bad stuff and appreciate it. <br /><br /><br />This is just my personal view on it, I&#039;m not experienced in selling drugs at shows.

				Well, I&#039;m already missing out on Summercamp this year.&nbsp; I doubt I&#039;ll get the money in time for Electric Forest either.&nbsp; DEMF is out of the question too.&nbsp; Wakarusa looks good, but once again, the money issue.&nbsp; I had fun at a small hippie festival last year.&nbsp; Smoked a ton of hash and enjoyed some local bands.&nbsp; Chicago&#039;s PeaceFest looks like it&#039;ll be amazing.&nbsp; Last year sucked so bad, tho.&nbsp; Any festival or event I went to last summer, I had my broken hand.&nbsp; So I was in a cast the whole time, and having a cast while tripping on acid is HORRIBLE.&nbsp; Worst experience ever.&nbsp; Made me so depressed, cause I couldn&#039;t actually ENJOY the festival and dance my ass off with my lights.&nbsp; Too bad my financial situation is so bad this year too.&nbsp; =/<br /><br />Let&#039;s see how many people went to a certain festival last year.&nbsp; Anyone remember &quot;Hard as Fuck&quot; guy?

				Who else is excited for summercamp?!!?&nbsp; Leaving for the drive down there in T-minus 4 hours!&nbsp; Hoping to get my usual spot inside the forest again this year, and weather looks better than last year! (i.e. not a mudfest the entire weekend).&nbsp;

				So I am heading for waka but got a quick question. If I were to be selling 2ci and 2ce while I am there should I focus on weighing out only individual capsules or do you think there will be people interested in .5g and gram bags? Ill be selling all hits for 5 bucks

I&#039;m sure they won&#039;t mind. Hell, whenever i sell a gram or two of MDMA already capped out most people thank me. <br /><br /><br />Oh and I&#039;ll be looking for you there!

				+1<br />In the interest of harm reduction cap the 2cs up. Some stupid kid would take finger dips of it get spun out and lose everything...including whats left in the gram bag you sold him...which im sure some other kid will ground score and take a few finger dips of...this could continue, who knows maybe all weekend, well i think you get my point. Id be safe and cap them up no ones going to have a scale that can acurately weigh mgs.

				Depending on how big your stash is you can also use a &quot;can safe&quot; that looks like a soda can and is weighted to feel full.&nbsp; Buy a 12-pack or case of the same type of soda, remove one and insert your stash can at the back of the pack.

				Randomly ran into another SR member at the satellite stage at Wakarusa.....whats up man???

I gotta say I took one and a half of SKYYs stars and they felt like they were opiate based rolls or something because while I felt awesome all I wanted to do was sit down and feel the bass on the ground, exact same thing that used to happen back when I could get opiate based rolls on the regular IRL. I really enjoyed rockers mdma and so did all my friends. After one night in my pocket though it looks like dmt or something, rather than being pink it is kind of turning tan, brown, red? I think I am going to start sticking with a strict mix of 80mg mda 80mg mdma and then dipping out of a mix from there because the night I mixed them was fucking amazing....a haven&#039;t danced that hard in a long long time.

				made the account wanting to be mollys bf....but this site has helped me so much in differentiating them all. I actually think I liked methylone a lot two. I split .5 of m1 with the lady for pretty lights and we had a blast being able to just do bumps here and there and be able to time the comedown. Did the stars the second night blah blah blah, did the mda/mdma mix while dipping the last night and it was awesome but got cut short by a storm so I ended up popping some benzos so I could get some sleep to get out of there early. Still need to try just the mda on it&#039;s own though.....

				there was some very clean white on white unperf&#039;d paper going around summercamp this year, knew I should have picked up a sheet instead of just a few 10strips to split among my fellow camp-mates.&nbsp; Ate just one on hit friday as a tester(had to eyeball the 10strip with a pair of scissors, was tasteless--a good first sign), could tell after 2 hours it was quite clean.&nbsp; Ate 3 for shpongle on sunday, tripped my balls off.&nbsp; Will be looking out for this crew at EFF

				EDC, Vegas was truly a roller coaster of highs and lows.&nbsp; First night was pretty damn good, although the area is so large and disorientating I often didn&#039;t know where I was or who I was listening too.&nbsp; Sky&#039;s MDMA may have played a roll in that...fucking amazing.<br /><br />Second night, started with walking by security with a tiny little piece of white paper (Thanks! Del Ellis) in my mouth.&nbsp; Right when I entered, Josh Wink was playing an insane set that brought me back to when I saw him 14 years ago.The set of the year for me was Bassnector.&nbsp; I have difficulty putting it into words, but I felt the music as much as I heard it.&nbsp; The vibe was excellent at Kinetic (Largest area) stage, I decided to stay for Calvin Harris.&nbsp; I was not very familiar with him, but he blew me away.&nbsp; During his set is where it can be described being right at the point of climax and your mom walks in.&nbsp; The music stopped and mass confusion started with reports of part of the stage falling and hitting Calvin, due to high winds.&nbsp; I was looking forward to Avicii, Tiesto, Blueman with Aoki so we stuck around for about an hour, which you can imagine how the rest of the evening went with 100,000k people all wanting to leave at the same time.<br /><br />Third night was an outstanding way to finish the festival.&nbsp; My crew were getting the hang of staying together without the assistance of cell phones (The don&#039;t work with that many people around).&nbsp; Chase and Status scared me away right starting off with rap, but my friends that stayed said it was an outstanding set.&nbsp; I rolled (Thanks Sky) over to ATB and stayed until David Guetta started.&nbsp; Overall, ATB took a little to long for me to get going.&nbsp; Guetta was very good, lots of familiar tracks, but most with a stupendous twist.&nbsp; Armin van Buuren stole the night with a hard hitting, dance your ass off (My favorite) set.&nbsp; Porter Robinson also had a very good set, which kept me there the whole time.&nbsp; Avicii went after Guetta, but was only a half hour.&nbsp; That half hour was absolutely amazing, which seems like it would be hard to pull off what he did in 30 minutes.&nbsp; I definitely will be seeing him on the flip side.<br /><br />Overall, I give EDC/Insomniac 5/5 for managing the largest crowd of party goers I have ever seen in my life.&nbsp; It sucked Saturday with the shut down, but the wind is not their fault and I am glad they put the safety of staff and crowd first.&nbsp;

				Finally got home from work and checked the Electric Forest artist schedule!<br /><br />A few things from a quick look:<br /><br />EOTO thursday!<br /><br />2.5 hour tribe set on Friday!!!<br /><br />When I first heard that Bassnectar and sts9 were at the same time, I was pissed.&nbsp; But 2.5 hours of tribe on friday makes up for it.&nbsp; plus, tribe plays from 12am-230am on saturday and bassnectar plays from 1230am-2am; so it&#039;d would be possible to see the start of tribe at sherwood court, head to the ranch for bassnectar, and then head back to sherwood for the end of tribe.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t sound as bad as I initially imagined!<br /><br />Papadosio &gt; a bit of keller &gt; DJ Solo early evening on sunday.&nbsp; girl talk then to big gigantic for the closer on sunday night!<br /><br />And I didn&#039;t even mention the hours upon hours of SCI sets!

Lol.... LE are looking for people moving larger amounts of product, so don&#039;t be too eager to offload all your gear on Thursday or Friday.&nbsp; IMO tent-hopping is much much safer than shouting your wares on shakedown street.&nbsp; <br /><br />Biggest thing I can suggest is to be careful when driving into and out I town. Local cops have a field day because they know almost everyone is holding.&nbsp; Drive under the speed limit, obey all traffic signals/signs.&nbsp; Especially in Michigan, they have some funky left turn lanes, so be aware.&nbsp; If you DO get pulled over, know your rights.<br /><br />If you&#039;re going there just to vend, try and get rid of everything before you leave, so you&#039;re not riding dirty on the way home.

The dude who set up camp next to me was selling mad amounts of liquid and rolls. I probably passed him at least 10x walking up and down shakedown street saying &quot;liquid, liquid, liquid&quot; over and over.&nbsp; All of a sudden while we were grilling up some hot dogs, this dude gets tackled and pinned down by four plain clothed undercovers.&nbsp; I assume he had just sold to one of them and was taken down for that.&nbsp; But the dude was ridiculously spun out since he was handling so much liquid, so his judgement was also likely impaired.<br /><br />I tend to see the most busts happen earlier on in the festival, like Friday.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think LE is gonna sit at a campsite and wait for someone to walk up, they&#039;re almost certainly gonna be on shakedown street.<br /><br />If you&#039;re really trying to move some real weight, the safest way would be to work in pairs with a partner.&nbsp; One does the talking but carries nothing on him, the partner carries the product and takes the money.&nbsp; This works well as a distraction tactic, since if you DO end up getting caught trying to sell, you will have nothing on you personally, and it gives your partner time to scatter.

				See you all in the Forest or maybe if we are lucky we will be neighbors on the camp grounds. I can&#039;t wait to be back in the forest we are rolling up with a nice crew as well this year so it should be some good times. Your best bet is do sell in the campgrounds. So many people walk around selling anything you could ever want. I will be doing the same but the key is make sure you aren&#039;t being followed when you go back to your site. Never carry to much on you as well. The drive there is the scariest part. I was holding vials of liquid K, lots of bud, and MDMA. the drive up was the scariest part because there were so many people pulled over on the way there and the cops pull all of your shit out of your car. They are looking for people who look like they are going to EF(every person i saw pulled over 20+ people in the state of Michigan were all heading to EF) and just pull you over but def watch your speed follow the laws make sure you have plenty of visibility out of your windows as well nothing blocking your view because they will pull you over for that. also if you have passengers make sure they stay seated and don&#039;t jump around in the car. Nothing will give you away or get you pulled over like your friends hopping from seat to seat. I know they will be excited but keep them calm you will get there and they you can run around like wild children, If you are taking a lot i would recommend putting it in a door panel or welding a box under your car in a wheel-well. Just be smart and you will be good. Also if you do get busted with a little amount or any amount. deny deny deny going back to your campsite.<br /><br />Hope to see you all in the forest&nbsp; ;D

I&#039;ve never been.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This will be my 4th time at Rothbury a.k.a. Electric Forest.&nbsp; They kinda stepped up security a tiny bit after switching from Rothbury to Electric Forest, though it&#039;s mostly the same.<br /><br />There are two basic stages to the security system:<br />1)&nbsp; Entering the campgrounds. - You camp next to your car, so all cars are &quot;searched&quot; when you&#039;re entering the campgrounds (also if you decide to leave and re-enter with your car, you will be re-searched).&nbsp; The vehicle search was never really intense; &#039;08 and &#039;09 I didn&#039;t even have to step out of my car, just open the trunk(assume they were just checking for nitrous tanks or smuggling people inside without a ticket).&nbsp; Last year, I did have to actually step out of the vehicle and they did a decent search.&nbsp; They confiscated a bag of charcoal and a few tiki torches from me, but failed to find my charcoal grill, my other bag of charcoal, or any of my drugs...lol.&nbsp; Depending on how much product you&#039;re bringing in, you would be safe buying a few of those hidden can-style safes(look like and are weighted like a regular can of coke or iced tea, but the top unscrews and its a stash box).&nbsp; I bought a couple Arizona Iced Tea(24oz tallboys) stash cans at a local headshop for about 10 bucks apiece, I fill up all my drugs inside, screw them back together, and throw them in a cooler with some legit cans of the same Arizona Iced Tea.&nbsp; If you&#039;re bringing in serious weight, maybe think about a hidden panel or something, but honestly they don&#039;t check that hard.&nbsp; Just be careful when driving TO Rothbury, MI....once you&#039;re within 20 miles of the festival, pay super close attention to speed limit and traffic signals.&nbsp; Local cops will do everything they can to pull festival-goers over, since almost everyone is riding dirty with some sort of illicit items.<br /><br />2) Entering the Stages - Most, if not all, of your vending will be done at the campgrounds, so if you made it past step one, then you&#039;re fine.&nbsp; If you want to have doses/rolls/other items to sell at the actual stages, you&#039;ll need to be a little craftier.&nbsp; Security will pat you down, look through your bags and everything.&nbsp; Personally, I have a baseball hat that has a hidden stash pocket built into it that can easily fit 30+ rolls, or 50+ capsules without making my hat look bulgy.&nbsp; You could do something like that, or you could crotch it, or a backpack with secret pockets, stuff it in your sock, get those boxer briefs with the hidden stash pocket, etc.&nbsp; The don&#039;t allow drinks inside the stage areas, unless its either an unopened water/gatorade, or an empty bottle.&nbsp; Also, a lot of the security people that are checking bags are volunteers that are only working for a free ticket, so they might just send you right through without a check.&nbsp; But they DO hire outside security also, so just be safe.<br /><br />As far as vending, I posted earlier in this thread on general rules to stay safe while vending.<br /><br />Have fun!&nbsp; Make a lot of people happy with LEGIT and PURE drugs!&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I suggest that you eat a ton of acid, mda, mdma, some 2c-x&#039;s, ketamine, and vape a huge breakthrough dose of DMT while lying in a hammock in the Sherwood Forest at night.&nbsp; Literally, you will BELIEVE that YOU are the &quot;Carl&quot; that everyone&#039;s been looking for for all these years................. :o

				I tested 10 different batches of LSD at EFF, only 1 came back as LSD. Needless to say I picked up a sheet it and it is good! Not as strong as USD&#039;s, but on par with 3janes Seed of Life. I ended up giving away ten more test kits, and only a few people told me their doses came back as LSD. I also heard of a lot of meth going around as MDMA.

Was quite fun. Also, Electric Forest was pretty fun.... not as fun as Rothbury 2009, which is half the reason I went to EF. <br /><br />Lot&#039;s of youngin&#039;s selling beat drugs at EF this year though.<br /><br />All Good Music festival in Thornville Ohio(formerly in WV, MD, etc) is the place to be. More drugs than the Silk Road!<br /><br />And if anyone is going to All Good... be sure to show some love to Heady Ruxpin late night! <br />Camped next to that dude at Electric Forest... he&#039;s like a modern day Jim Morrison if he chose Molly and Dubstep over Mescaline and Roock &amp; Roll... hahahaha<br /><br />Fucking love festival season. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I didn&#039;t go to EF, my buddies did though. He said someone went thru his camp and found his stash can and took his MDMA out of it.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll be at All Good!! I won&#039;t be working though. I &#039;might&#039; bring a little extra MDMA, but it all depends on how future orders look. <br /><br />I&#039;m not gonna be working L, cus the only dude i know who has it in town, i&#039;m not too cool with (he can be a tool) and I&#039;m not gonna buy a sheet off here and charge 20$ a hit, 150$ a strip.. I&#039;d feel bad, and I&#039;d get laughed at. <br /><br /><br />Hope to see some of you guys on the lot!

That frat-boy looking kid selling &quot;fire doses&quot; that you see man-handling the strips/sheets care-free with no gloves or foil or anything.<br />There&#039;s a dime-a-dozen of these asshats, and they&#039;re easy to find. Their prices are higher than they should be(for LSD) and their blotter is 9 times out of 10 is some kind of pastel-colored art blotter, with a bitter ether-y taste to it.<br /><br />2. Any black dude that doesn&#039;t look like Jimi Hendrix or Lennie Kravitz... basically, if they don&#039;t look like they would listen to the music playing at the venue... they&#039;re probably just scammers trying to make a buck on some dumb young white kids.<br /><br />3. &quot;Raver girls&quot; - Another dime-a-dozen scam artist. There will always be mildly cute to smokin&#039; hot girls... barely wearing anything except a lot of glowsticks and body paint, who have &quot;awesome molly&quot; ... but 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s artificial sweetener, or a concoction of drugs crushed and mixed. They know they can get you because they know how to cut it up enough so that it tastes ok... but it&#039;s always powdery, and cheaper than it should be (50 a gram? 60 a gram?)<br /><br />Who to buy drugs off of at festivals:<br /><br />1. Me.<br /><br />2. Any road-worn dead-head with like 50 13 pt lightning bolts in forms of tattoos, badges, pins, etc. Look for the guy who looks like he hasn&#039;t stopped tripping L for 10 years... basically.<br /><br />3. Anyone willing to reagent test their own products on the spot. Most experienced festie dealers come prepared.<br /><br />...and remember. You can&#039;t fake fire nugs. :D<br /><br />Bisco... be careful if you&#039;re importing... lots of UNCLEs(under cover law enforment) at Bisco the last couple years.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Gonna have to disagree with you in regards to buying drugs from wooks. Its all luck if you don&#039;t have kids you know that are legit to deal with. Do not get me wrong, vets will have good stuff sometimes, but those same dudes are also more likely to have some kind of dope habit going on and more willing to bunk you.<br /><br />I will say that on tour there are many that feel it is totally within their right to bunk or short custies left and right. <br /><br />As for the &quot;raver kids&quot;, Phish around 1998-99 start to get a big influx of these type of kids. I was sort of one of them myself. You know the type, the kids that are bumping DnB or Hip Hop out in the lot. Often, these kids had the best MDMA and would have connections for other good shit like Foxy or 2C-B. For whatever reason, that whole look became popular and now everyone kind of emulates it. But I can tell you that for a long time these were usually the ones that were most legit. <br /><br />Of course, at the end of the day it all comes down to the person. Some people are cool, some are dicks. The whole festival culture didn&#039;t really blow up till recently, it kinda changed the game. You are less likely to see the same people over and over again nowadays.

				Every year around this time we get ready to head out to Underground Sounds. I was lucky enough to be a part of that festival every year it happened. From the Cave, to Camp Zoe, to Hogrock Ranch. Such a blast each year, just too bad Tom Foolery pretty much lost everything this last year. Even tho alot of the artists didn&#039;t show up, I had a ton of fun. Always on the lookout for the groundscores. I remember taking the newbies to &quot;the lookout&quot; at the Cave. So many good memories.

				Alright, I need some help. I&#039;ve got a festival coming up and some MDMA capsules, its the first year I&#039;ve tried to get shit in and I know from the years before that they have sniffer dogs out the front while you line up. I was thinking of taking the battery out of my mobile, putting them in there and pretending like I&#039;m talking to someone on the way in.

Dogs smell like we see, and will see the different things that make up a smell, so a field at a festival could be grass, smoke, beer and marijuana, and the dog will trained to notice that smell and move towards it. Masking it or having it in your phone won&#039;t help if they&#039;ve been trained to find it.<br /><br />http://www.cannabisculture.com/node/8634<br />Read this for more information :)

I&#039;ve got a festival coming up and some MDMA capsules, its the first year I&#039;ve tried to get shit in and I know from the years before that they have sniffer dogs out the front while you line up. I was thinking of taking the battery out of my mobile, putting them in there and pretending like I&#039;m talking to someone on the way in. Or is there just a universally better way of getting stuff in?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It&#039;s likely they&#039;re not trained to sniff out MDMA but if you&#039;re trying to get them in and want to be safe put them in an airtight container and make sure you wash the container on the outside afterwards. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MDMA is part of the standard dog qualifying package, as far as I know, and it is safest to assume a working dog will alert to it or has been trained at one time to alert to it... so treat this like a shipping question.<br />Seal anything as late as possible before you go in, as in the morning you leave, and keep it cooler rather than warmer. You have this luxury, unlike a shipper.<br />Seal it airtight, as sselevol wrote, - which is not a ziploc bag or saran wrap.&nbsp; &nbsp;This one time maybe regular plastic food-saver type sealing would be OK, double-sealed, since it&#039;s *very* short-duration, although I still would use the barrier bags instead. You can make a little ravioli-type pouch with some effort, depending on your sealer. If you can, trim off the pointy corners, depending on where you&#039;re carrying it. :)<br />Submerge in water and look for leaks, then wash.<br />^All of this is how my kennel club hides stealth dog bait when training for scent work for utility class, we&#039;ve really improved at this. Or canned using low-heat method in glass jars - but I&#039;m guessing a festival with dogs doesn&#039;t allow glass.<br /><br />Worth going later in the crowd when dogs start to fatigue. Maybe there are festivals that are smart enough to rotate the dogs through, I haven&#039;t seen this, but limited exposure to dog-using events. They seem to be for show, largely, to reassure the parents/citizenry, and when I&#039;ve watched them they&#039;re wilting pretty fast. The dogs, not the parents. <br /><br />OK, obsessive, I know, but I am pretty good at sneaking things past my own dog, who checks me over every day thoroughly - and hasn&#039;t found anything in weeks. I can have fresh chicken in those pouches and it gets by. There&#039;s kind of a knack to making little &quot;treat ravioli,&quot; but it&#039;s not hard.

				Planning my drugs for festival season and considering how to conceal them. Would weed in an air-tight container with food covering it work? I was going to take 2C-B caps and wasn&#039;t worried about them as the dogs that are likely to be by the gates won&#039;t be trained to detect them, but I might use a container to stay safe. My friends have molly so I&#039;ve told them to as well. I also have blotters which should be okay in a book?

				Schwag was the shit always a good time and the drugs were real. But you can&#039;t generalize that to all of the midwest...not to hate but go to Summercamp and trust me you&#039;ll find the bunk version of every drug known to man. Not saying there aren&#039;t good drugs there as well but you have to be just as careful in the midwest as the coast. I tested 4 different peoples &quot;molly&quot; that walked through my camp site at waka this year.

Just not nearly as much as other fests.<br /><br />At waka i saw hella ppl selling bogus shit. I saw two ppl with moonrocks that looked good. Another guy came by saying he had &quot;sass/MDMA combo&quot; <br /><br />It was crystal but they were these tiny, uniform hexagon crystals. Definitely didn&#039;t look like any MDMA i&#039;ve ever seen. <br /><br />I tried selling some of Pf&#039;s stuff, but had trouble cus it was finely crushed, and I could tell most people didn&#039;t believe me when i told them it was crystal MDMA that had been crushed. <br /><br />Honestly though, I&#039;d be weary of someone saying something like that. <br /><br /><br />there was hella good LSD at All Good though

				Just got back from FloydFest in Floyd, VA. Shit was sick.<br /><br />Lots of people claiming to be selling lucy. Bought a 10 strip from a dude who seemed legit (I know, right?). A friend bought some too from the same gay and later that night told me it definitely wasn&#039;t lucy, but was still a lot of fun. So now the only thing I am upset about is not knowing what it is but still enjoying it.<br /><br />I had some DOC on blotter than I brought and gave some to friends to take one night. They all loved the energy it gave and the way it made you feel like you controlled the music while dancing. Took 3 tabs myself before Leftover Salmon, but don&#039;t remember a single thing from the show even though I was there. I do remember tripping hardcore during Conspirator and later for ArtOfficial before wandering around the grounds until about 4am. DOC is definitely more fun than LSD for festivals, in my opinion, solely because of the energy it gives.

				i think a bit of discretion is probably a good idea but LE is just perfectly aware of the some of the things that go on at music festivals, especially heavily electronic ones. and especially in the fucking southeast US<br /><br />from the sounds of it gnarnia had pretty rookie organization and management, and was totally hustled by sheriff&#039;s departments around it. i also heard the main organizer (who i won&#039;t name but it&#039;s no big secret) was popped in TN a little while back and was facing felony charges. lots of creepy speculation on gnarnia&#039;s facebook pages...<br /><br />at any rate, this is probably a reasonably secure place to discuss simply attending festies, and perhaps speculating what drugs might &amp; might not be there....

I used to go to a festival that was recently shut down, because it was very open with drugs use and sales. It was on a private property, and the guy who owned the property was in a Dead tribute band that threw the fest. So he never let LE on the grounds, he hired his own security staff that really didn&#039;t give a fuck as long as you weren&#039;t working crack/H/nitrous, although occasionally those things could be found...<br /><br />Long story short, that place is no more. It was a beautiful location, full of beautiful people ( some crazy ones as well) and great drugs. Plus Dead tunes all weekend? Fuck yeah. A lot of people called this place Home. As more an more people realized you go there and get pretty much anything, feds started having undercovers. <br /><br /><br />I&#039;m really stoned so I&#039;m probably not explaining my point very well, but my point is that there pretty much needs to be a happy medium of this at festivals. Every one can pretty much assume drug use is going to happen at festivals. But when people start selling it openly and people start getting hurt from irresponsible use/bunk shit, enforcement is going to take more of an interest. <br /><br />If your working, walk around campsites and meet people. I like that way better anyway, you get to meet more cool people, and you can score some free beers time to time.<br />Just my .2 BTC

				That Gnarnia festival was straight up out of control. Check this story one of my friends on FB posted. It&#039;s too crazy not to be true!!<br /><br /><br />Crazy story from my boy [name redacted]: &quot;We camped next to a group of four hotties. 1st night, one of &#039;em asks if I want to smoke rock. She comes into my tent, yadda yadda yadda, she&#039;s tossing my salad, it&#039;s crazy. Whole tent is a fog. I&#039;ve got about six tenths of this clean shard, swallow half. She licks my cack, sprinkles the rest on it, and tells me to f- her in the butt. I guess this is called &quot;plunging&quot;, but I always thought it was BS. Who does this? But here she is and she wants it. So, in it goes. She hollers, like, loudly. Then BAM! the tent fly zips open and two cops come in all hunched over with flashlights. They pull us apart, me with a chili dog. She&#039;s laughing. I don&#039;t know why. Maybe the shard hits fast that way. I yell something like &quot;Whoa! Courtesy! Two fucking minutes!&quot; The younger cop laughs. The tent smells like crack smoke and a little bit like poop. Turns out that these cops were using infrared goggles and could see us hitting the chubba through the wall of the tent. Well, by this time all they could find was one bowl and an empty baggy. I took a pee in the cop car. I got a lawyer on retainer for 5K. Don&#039;t know about her.&quot;<br /><br />I literally didn&#039;t know whether to laugh, cry, or puke after reading this gem!!

				^^^^^<br /><br />well i suppose on what sort of music festival you are going to, and what drugs you are into. but for me<br /><br />good supply of psychedelics. lsd and shrooms are pretty classic festie drugs. ive been enjoying 4-aco-dmt instead of shrooms lately. i think almost any psychedelic you are familiar with would go well at a music festival. in addition, if you are into rave/edm sorts of music and fests, a good supply of mdma/rolls is a definite must. i always bring twice as much per night as i normally would take, as it seems to go faster :P<br /><br />i always have some landing gear for coming down/sleep. benzos and opes, or both. and of course bud, if youre into that. and nitrous too<br /><br />shit i guess almost any drug lol. drink lots of H20 and stay out of the sun

				I got a bunch of buddies who went to North Coast, they go every year. They say it&#039;s wicked fun but idk if i can handle a couple days of straight beats. I love EDM, but I love bluegrass, jam bands and funk too. That&#039;s why I love festivals like Wakarusa, they have a little bit of everything, but heavy on the jam side.<br /><br />In the winter there&#039;s a lot of awesome raves around the city, so Summer is my time to travel and see a bunch of psychedelic jams, whereas in the Winter i settle down at home and go to raves. <br /><br /><br />Caught Phish in STL last week, quite the experience to say the least, 3Jane&#039;s amazing blotters had a hand in that.

				Bass music on acid is something else, honestly. At EDC I saw Bassnectar. Say what you want but that was fucking insanity. It took me to other dimensions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also heard more psychedelic EDM at smaller festivals, or maybe I was just tripping too hard.

				Just back from Dimensions Festival in Croatia. What a festival it was. Great music, great people and the most scenic place i&#039;ve ever seen for a festival.<br /><br />At night, the music was on in the grounds of an old fort. They had stages in the dungeons, in the moat of the fort, the courtyard etc. The line up was pretty epic also. During the day, the music was on a beach. Summer sounds on the beach were nothing short of epic!! The vibe was very relaxed and I couldn&#039;t get over how friendly everyone was. The range of drugs available was great also :-)<br /><br />I met so many cool people and would highly recommend it for anyone for next year!

The next page tells me my order can&#039;t be processed because, in other words, my bank thinks this is a fraudulent transaction since I&#039;m buying tickets from Europe. So it kicks me out of line and after waiting for over an hour everything is sold out.<br /><br />A week later the airline I booked a flight with calls me saying the flight is cancelled and all tickets will be fully refunded.

				I&#039;m not one for straight Electronic Festivals. By all means I really dig electronic music, in the Midwest here we get some pretty good raves goin&#039;, especially in the Winter time. <br /><br />But I&#039;ve always been more of a hippie stoner type I guess. I really want to check out Electric Forest, I have friends who went when it was Rothbury, before String Cheese was throwing the festival. They said it&#039;s definitely different, but that forest and 3 nights of String Cheese alone would be worth hearing all those womps in between. <br /><br />Wakarusa was the shit this year. Not too many electronic artist, but who they did have was awesome. Pretty Lights blew my mind, I was on like 20-25mg of 2-cb, at least i think it was like 20mg..<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait till next Summer though, especially now that my LSD collection is growing

				TICKETS NOW ON SALE ($370 for 3 days; $710 for all 6 days) *crazy, huh?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Ultra Music Festival 2013 in Miami, now have tickets for sale. I was suppose to get a notice when the early bird tickets were to go on sale. I don&#039;t know if they sent me that notice or this is the early bird prices. Apparently, it is a 6 day festival this year. Two weekends, Friday thru Sunday. Problem is, the pricing. It is an awesome festival with the best talent in the world (Thanks to WMC being held at the same time.) They are only selling 3 days tickets and 6 day tickets, at this time. The 3 day tickets are $300 + $70 (fee for idk wtf) and the 6 day is $710...That&#039;s with the fee included. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I know this is a super rave, but damn! $35 for tickets to State Palace Theater, was well worth it. Anytime they charged more than $25, you knew they were having an awesome ass laser show included. They always had the best acts in the biz too. Rabbit in the moon (live), Bad Boy Bill, RHV, Micro, dj Monk, Mix Master Mike, Paul Oakenfold, Micro, dj Dan, etc... I know the 3000-5000 people that would attend State Palace, is not shit compared to the 100k, that will be going to UMF. I even saw UMF on the end of Drugs Inc., Ecstacy. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, I know the SR will be representing. I just hope we do it on the down low. Please no shirts with a green camel. I probably will lose my PLUR and punch someone in the face. <br />I&#039;m looking forward to this festival and maybe someone can create a special thread for it. whoever make it, will have one dandy ass time! haha...I had more fun at Ultra, then I did in Amsterdam for 16 days,,,but that&#039;s IMO. <br /><br />&quot;SP from Gulf Coast&quot;

Was there last Summer and it was class. The line-up was the best dance music line up I have ever seen, and the sun shining so it was spot on. Would love to go to Secret Garden Party in the UK as well, so hoping to get a few mates on board. I have been eying up Primavera Sound in Barcelona for the last few years as well. They get a very impressive line up, so I will probably bite the bullet and go there in June as well.<br /><br />Your plan sounds awesome by the way :)

				Anyone in the southeast should check out Art Basel Miami Beach, and in particular the Moksha Art Fair (mokshaartfair2012.com). Their closing party has Phadroid, Toubab Krewe, Heyoka, Govinda and 30+ other artists for $40, plus a bunch of ridiculous psychedelic art, installations and live painting.<br /><br />Gonna be crazy, I love visiting the city for Art Basel every year!

				North Coast in Chicago was incredibly awesome, they&#039;ve been having it for a few years now and I normally go for 1 day depending on the lineups. Mostly Electronic stuff but there were a few rap/hip-hop acts. Axwell headlined the day I went and it was pure bliss. Not to mention Knife Party right before that, it was sick. Security was pretty lax, lots of awesome things to do, good people all over.<br /><br />Spring Awakening also in Chicago was the best festival and concert(s) I&#039;ve ever been to. It was at fucking Solider Field! Skrillex headlined and there were tons of other good names there like Benny Benassi, A-Trak, Tommy Trash, Kill the Noise. Security barely existed and there were many vendors and things available to buy, including food, clothing, accessories and even bowls/pieces! I think its going to be an annual deal so I hope to go back next June!<br /><br />Never been to Summer Camp but hear great things about it.

I need my jams and funk.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I like you&#039;re style.<br /><br />Haha I was tripping at beat antique and thought they were fucking with us when they said they could only do one more song because there was a tornado coming...I just started giggling then all of a sudden the music stopped....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>i was on some acid, some of skyy&#039;s old molly before he went rouge, and had been snorting some k, in the front of the crowd at beats. i was in the perfect zone for beats, it was awesome. i too, remember when they first said the tornado was comming, we all thought it was a joke and started chearing, cause they were like &quot;and the thunder gods&quot;. then that douche came back on the mike and was like &quot;no, get the fuck out of here&quot; and all of us in the front are fucked up as shit thinking, wtf is going on, were all too fucked up. it was insane, but i did have a lot of fun. i honestly can&#039;t fully explain how i was able to walk back to my campsite in the woods :)

				Starscape... I can not wait...with the road on my side, it shall be the best I have ever been to. Last year blew, got scammed 4x local, nothing around there because im &quot;old&quot; in the mind of most of the people there...but this year, I am prepared and can not wait...<br /><br />I dont leave the area much especially for a festival, but would love to try another place within 3/4 hours.

				last waka was amazing, has so much fun :) i also went to starscape, which was pretty crazy, but surprisingly dirty, like more dirty then any of the other festivals i went to last summer. they also ran out of water, had the sound for a stage go down, a ton of problems. sonic bloom was pretty fun in colorado, and security was a joke, they weren&#039;t checking for drugs, just glass alcohol and tanks. this summer i&#039;m not fully sure what i&#039;ll be going to, the only thing i know for sure i want to go to is BM, possibly waka and EF, maybe starscape since its fairly close by, really depends on the line up. also thinking about biscoe and a few others, but really depends on how much money i have as BM is my main priority :)

I hate climbing hills though, so it makes sense. haha - Plus, the disorganization made security a joke.

				i mean I did see like 2 people get arrested at scamp. But my GF and I had no problems smuggling in enough drugs to get use through the weekend, and sell to a handful of people. The music was great, I also was disappointed that Janes Addiction was a headliner, but seeing Bob Weir come out with Primus and play &#039;the other one&#039; was a one in a lifetime experience. truly a beautiful moment.<br /><br />if anyone ever has a chance to go to a festival at The Gorge in WA, do it. Sasquatch is one huge one, I saw phish there for 2 days and it was incredibly. By far the most beautiful and breathetaking natural amphitheater I have been to, ever.

				So many planned if I can get the money together.<br /><br />I do Coachella every year, so that one&#039;s a given. I had Nocturnal/Escape/White Wonderland and FYF earlier this year and all of those might be repeats as well. I&#039;m thinking that Lightning in a Bottle is also a for sure this year. Same with Outside Lands and possibly EDC. I&#039;m hoping for Electric Zoo, Lollapalooza, and Ultra. Bestival would be amazing, but that will probably be a 2014 thing.

He&#039;ll just go off into space with guitar solos for like, 30 minutes.

I thought instantly Phish fans = Assholes, Phish = Assholes.<br />Cheese blew my fucking skull off. I was not prepared for them. I had heard some live shit from 98/99... early 2000&#039;s... but seeing one of their first shows in years, and it being their only show that year... they were geared up. Plus that epic Rothbury 2009 line-up omg:<br /><br />The Dead(w/ Warren), Bob Dylan &amp; his band, String Cheese Incident, Willie Nelson &amp; Fam., The Black Crowes, Nas &amp; Damien Marley, STS9(2sets), G.

I get where you&#039;re coming from on the whole Trey front. I love their keyboardist and drummer, they throw in some really cool, psychedelic shit sometimes. Yeah the jams can go on for awhile, but they&#039;re some on point fucking jams. <br />Trey can fuckin&#039; wail on that geetar though man! I loooove me some Dead, but I like heavy music too. A lot of Dead heads in my area love to talk shit on Phish. Normally though they do it just to get a rise out of Phish kids. <br /><br />To each his own though. <br /><br />Cheese is definitley on the top of my &#039;Next to See&#039; list. I&#039;ve got a few shows on my computer I listen to from time to time and they&#039;re pretty awesome.

But i dont mosh and have respect for people keep it plur. I was too faded the whole to notice the douche bags, I wasn&#039;t familiar enough with the festival scene to drop some doses, I even had one with me. I&#039;ve never experience the dead or cheese, but i&#039;d be down to groove to some. Lotus, conspirator i;ve seen and I can dig that. <br /><br />And fuck yeah dude bassnectar is the best =p

I&#039;m not saying I don&#039;t like bass... I like Bassnectar, love Pretty Lights, Girl Talk, Tiesto, Nero, Skrillex, EOTO, Big Gigantic, etc.<br /><br />...I just don&#039;t like when a bunch of &#039;kids&#039; who aren&#039;t old enough to drink come, get drunk as fuck, and then just start being assholes. Think about when you were in HS... now imagine all those fuckers, wasted, aggressive, shirtless, and not giving a shit about anyone else...<br /><br />That was the crowd last year. And of the above mentioned, only Bassnectar and EOTO played, and both on Sunday. It was a lot hotter than previous years, and dry as fuck. There was dust everywhere, everyone/everything was filthy, but not in a good way. UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ at 3 pm in the blazing sun, 100 degrees, no tent, limited shade(outside of sherwood) ... <br /><br />It just failed miserably imo. Cheese even made comments on stage about how young the crowd was, how wild the crowd got, and how it was clear that the majority of people there would rather be listening to Bassnectar. --Dubstep obviously has gotten very popular in mainstream music. Hip-Hop/Pop/Rock... over Dubstep and &quot;liquid bass&quot; lines. Suddenly half the shit on the radio sounds like Skrillex, Nero, or Bassnectar made the beat... and those kids get turned on to &#039;real&#039; dubstep, and FLOCK to the already crowded festivals. Its just turning into a shit show of careless people, carelessly using drugs and alcohol, being dicks. There were so many kids beating other kids on fake L that these kids start thinking they&#039;re immune to LSD. I saw some kid buy a strip from someone I knew of fluff, and he told the kid straight up: &quot;Dude, you&#039;re probably good with half a dose. One will definitely free your soul.&quot; And this kid was like &quot;oh man, fuck that, im eating 5 this time, cause last time I didnt feel nothin&quot; .... We all go &quot;Seriously?!&quot; at the same time, and my friend snatched it out of the kids hand like &quot;Bro... I don&#039;t care if you got ripped off in the past, do NOT just think you&#039;re invincible, this is the REAL DEAL.&quot; He ate 2. An hour later I saw the kid huddled in a lawnchair with a wet towel over his head, looked like he was having a hell of a come-up. Then like 4-5 Hours later he was back at my campsite, thanking my boy for stopping him from eating more... he was all grins, and black holes. He never made it in to see Cheese that day, but he didn&#039;t seem bothered. Saw him again later in the weekend, and he was fried. Obviously got his hands on a lot(too much) of ecstasy. ...Kids...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I feel bad, cus most of those kids that do that shit are my peers. I&#039;m quite young still, and the fact I&#039;m not a careless fool i guess makes me come off as a bit older, cus people (especially fellow festival goers) are a bit surprised when i tell them my actual age. <br />But yeah, all those stupid ass kids you mentioned, I know them. I had to grow up around them, shaking my fucking head back when the great Family Fluff hit out area and dumb ass 17 yr old girls are downing 3-7 hits at home by themselves, and of course freaking the fuck out. <br />This new generation is a bit wild (isn&#039;t that always said about the new generations though?) and for some of their mindless debauchery, i do apologize. <br />BUT! I do ask that some of you older heads don&#039;t judge all of the youngins&#039; too quickly, cus some of us out there are real heady folks contributing a lot to the scene. <br /><br />That said, Summercamp and Wakarusa are officially bought! Now time to save for some Mid and Late Summer fests. I&#039;m reallyreallyreally hoping Phish does another Summer tour though, I doubt it, I think Trey&#039;s just gonna tour his new solo album. <br />&#039;Tis OK though, good tunes are good tunes.

				&nbsp;::) I won&#039;t tell you specifics, but I&#039;m not an &quot;old head&quot; ... despite my avatar. hahahaha<br /><br />I&#039;m often told I look 8-10 years younger than I actually am... My &#039;generation&#039; of peers were wild. We still are. But there&#039;s a difference between &#039;wild&#039; and &#039;wreckless&#039; ... <br /><br />The youngest &#039;generation&#039; of adult-teens today are the &#039;spice and bathsalts&#039; generation. Whenever I&#039;m in a headship that sells spice, or synthetic &#039;drugs&#039; or &quot;ipod screen cleaner&quot; or whatever the fuck, I&#039;m always tempted to sell these kids REAL drugs. But, then I think about it, and I just don&#039;t think they&#039;re the same people. Arguing weed vs. spice, is the same argument of DMT vs. Salvia... One is illegal, one is not. Both have &#039;similar&#039; effects/intensities but appeal to two entirely different types of people. The lure of the illegal substance is &quot;I shouldn&#039;t be doing this...&quot; while the lure of the legal substance is... &quot;I can totally get away with this.&quot; <br /><br />It does annoy me that people have the mentality though, that if the substance you want isn&#039;t legal... to &quot;create&quot; a &quot;similiar&quot; compound that IS legal. LSD never made anyone eat anyone else&#039;s face off.... but then &quot;bathsalts&quot; come along claiming to be &quot;synthetic LSD&quot;... and suddenly news headlines are:<br /><br />&quot;Man tripping on LSD eats another living mans face!&quot; ... <br /><br />Next thing you know... some kids gonna smoke a blunt of spice, wreck is car, and they&#039;re going to be saying &quot;MARIJUANA CAUSES DEADLY ACCIDENT&quot; ... <br /><br />Media, the enemy, likes fear monger.<br /><br />

				I went to wakarusa this year, was my first festival and it was amazing. Not sure if this is normal or not but i constantly have dreams about waka. i remember vividly being in one dream and saying &quot;Dude this is your first time at waka? This is my third time this year!&quot;<br /><br />Waka changed my perspective on people and drugs alike. I met some of the coolest people there. Saw the dankest weed ever there also-some Nigerian Nightmare this guy brought from CO. 100% Violet color. <br /><br />I had a couple buddies go to electric forest this year and they had an amazing time also. I wanna go to EF and waka next year if possible

				Counterpoint was awesome! Great artists, great venue, great atmosphere! I highly suggest going there even if you don&#039;t live near Atlanta. The security was so lax. Visible open bottles of alcohol were not taken out of our car. Security patdowns were very lenient as well... my girl only had to do the ole molly in the bra trick to get in.

				at waka we were smoking a bowl when security came up to door to check us out early. they were tryin to get us in quick. he commented on how strong our bud smelt, asked if we had any &quot;contraband&quot; in the car, of course we said no, stoned as hell, and he said cool and marked us off then on to next car. security at gates within festival grounds to get to shows would feel bags of molly and tupperware containers and let you slide on by. We even brought a big ass bong into one of the bluegrass/jam band shows.

In fact, I just fucken love music. Hell, I&#039;d sell my soul to see pink floyd or dire straights....&nbsp; Even James Taylor blows my mind. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how much people know about this shit call oxytocin, which our brain only releases under certain circumstances. Singing in a group releases it, sex releases it, being in the crowd at a gig where everyone is &quot;feeling it&quot; releases it. Drugs potentiate it.&nbsp; I feel it&#039;s a massive part of what drug users and live music fans are chasing.<br /><br />

				DEMF, Movement, whatever you want to call it. Probably the only decent major EDM festival left in the USA.&nbsp; Not only is there the festival, there&#039;s an ungodly amount of epic afterhours parties thrown by some awesome artist.&nbsp; Its hosted in Detroit, the city that gave birth to techno.&nbsp; The people there are well educated in the music department. They are there for the music. General admission tix prices are most reasonable for a 3 day festival. None of this $300+ crap

The place has changed some but it all depends on how you handle yourself and the crowd you keep.<br /><br />I admit, in the early 2000&#039;s people would walk around yelling, &quot;fungi, fungi&quot;, or &quot;I got doses!&quot;, it does not really work that way anymore. Nowadays I bring my own drugs with me, and I only give and receive drugs from good friends, and money is never exchanged. <br /><br />As far as the company you keep, well look at the times. You have pistol toting, pants saggin, Jordan wearing punks running around trying to sell crack and rob hippies, times are changing. I dont blame them for tightening up.<br /><br />I had a good experience at Gory at the Quarry this last October. My cousin ate a quarter of Golden Teachers during the end of the Waterband set and he fell out, I just think the visuals and the intense head space got to him, I grew them myself and they were fire.

The place has changed some but it all depends on how you handle yourself and the crowd you keep.<br /><br />I admit, in the early 2000&#039;s people would walk around yelling, &quot;fungi, fungi&quot;, or &quot;I got doses!&quot;, it does not really work that way anymore. Nowadays I bring my own drugs with me, and I only give and receive drugs from good friends, and money is never exchanged. <br /><br />As far as the company you keep, well look at the times. You have pistol toting, pants saggin, Jordan wearing punks running around trying to sell crack and rob hippies, times are changing. I dont blame them for tightening up.<br /><br />I had a good experience at Gory at the Quarry this last October. My cousin ate a quarter of Golden Teachers during the end of the Waterband set and he fell out, I just think the visuals and the intense head space got to him, I grew them myself and they were fire.

				Am at a crossroads... my crew is dead set on EF... I have to sell my SCAMP ticket because I realized I have other obligations that weekend... I want to do waka, but the friend I wanted to do waka with was set on doing All Good with me...then he gets popped and drops a name and I can&#039;t even talk to this person anymore. Like there&#039;s so much drama in my friends group about festivals right now I&#039;m thinking about just buying 2 tickets for like each fest of the summer and just convincing people to go with me because I don&#039;t think they are capable of deciding for themselves. also doing roo, spring awakening (may sound gay but was SOOO dope last year), north coast and whatever else rolls through the area. <br /><br />Yeah, my main issue right now is finding someone to go to waka with because a lot of my friends will only do one or two fests. Apparently they haven&#039;t learned that they can use the barter system at festivals to pay for their tickets...<br /><br />yeah, just excited and anxious in general for the festive season!

				i have my EF ticket already, and really wanna go to waka again as well, but not really sure who would go with me. last year i went to waka, then starscape, then sonic bloom, stereoterra, and a underground festival at the begining of the summer in taos, NM. EF i&#039;m going to for sure, and i&#039;m ganna try to go to burning man, maybe waka, maybe starscape, maybe counterpoint, maybe biscoe. it really just depends on how much money i have, if i can get off of work, and if i have someone to go with.

				Electric Forest all the way!!!!! Last year I had the best time of my entire LIFE there, its the only festival I&#039;ve ever been to but by far the most amazing experience I&#039;ve ever experienced lol, already bought my ticket.... Had a talk with my boss a couple weeks ago, told her that if I can&#039;t have june 27th to july 1st off then I would put in my two week notice around the beginning of june, pretty much a dead end job anyways so it wouldn&#039;t be that much of a disapointment, since last year was such a life changing experience I couldn&#039;t miss it this year, its suppossed to be even better!!! Bassnectar was insaneeeee last year, can&#039;t wait for the rest of the lineup to come out, so anxious for june already, like a kid locked outside of the candy store&nbsp; :(

July 18th - July 21st. This will be my first time at this festival. has anyone ever gone and would like to enlighten on it?

It was indoors and the floor was vinyl or some shit, like a basketball court. That floor + paint = impossible to dance, bunch of slippage<br /><br />2. The music sucked and I love to rave.

Was disgusting. Shit got all over my car, was impossible to wash off my hair/face, and I looked like I crawled out of a dumpster. I have a picture of myself like this. Its not pretty. <br /><br />6. Based upon the picture of myself alone: Would not recommend.

We were forced to pull all items out of our pockets and bags were checked pretty carelessly. Did receive a subtle pat-down though, honestly just feeling for guns/knives/weapons. Bunch of &quot;security&quot; on the inside wearing red shirts, but they looked like volunteers, to be frank. Didn&#039;t catch too many undercovers/actual police or anything of that nature, of course I was fucked up most of the day&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be too worried unless your trying to sneak in 100&#039;s of rolls. We bought some decent ones off a guy last year. This festival is odd though, because there is no age requirement, so alot of under 17 people were there. Not sure if that was a good thing or not?<br /><br />SA is awesome, I&#039;ll hopefully be there in June!

My method has been using an M&amp;Ms minitube and putting all the goodies in there and shoving that in my underwear. Worst case scenario I could just say its my dick and I&#039;m hard. Its never come to that, but that would be my plan. <br /><br />I&#039;d be curious to know the method you use. Care to share?<br /><br />Cheers.<br />HEATFan

For males, the easiest way is to put them anywhere in your crotch area. It depends on how hard your festivals search, because most of the ones around me barely pat you down and you walk straight in. HOWEVER, I have been caught before, because they made me spread my legs and they cupped my ballsack and rubbed the shit out of my dick. I almost got hard, and lost about $2G&#039;s of product. The security was corrupt &amp; kept it for themselves and didn&#039;t report me to the cops and simply kicked me out.<br />If you want to bring about 100-200 pills in, the best way is to tape a baggy in between the shaft of your penis and the top of your ballsack. Works every time, 99% of the time.

				100th post!<br /><br />I recommend, in no particular order: Craven, Big Valley or Merritt Mountain. All are country music festivals, but there are tens of thousands of people partying their asses off, so it&#039;s a great time. +/- $200 for a ticket, then count on another few hundred for fuel and camping stuff. I always recommend taking 2 good quality generators so you have unlimited power for running a good stereo system so you can have the party at your campsite after the bands stop (around 11PM) and after the beer gardens close (3AM). Good times, and worth the trip to any of them.

I had 20g from CANNA INC i brought with me, a lot of em were single rocks that weighed 1 gram, people went crazy for that shit, sold out in an afternoon. Traded some of 3janes LSD for some pins and weed too. <br />Noticed a lot of 25i there though... <br /><br /><br />Snoop Lion was badass, I&#039;m so glad he mostly played Snoop Dogg songs, I was a big Snoop fan back in my younger hip hop days, and there was a Swisher tent there handing out free cigarillos, so it was perfect.<br /><br />Widespread was fucking pure bliss. My face was melted. Zoogma came out and started with the Jurrassic park song, I was so high i couldn&#039;t stop laughing it was great. Yo Mama&#039;s Big Fat Booty band covered &quot;Oh baby I like it raw&quot; by Old Dirty Bastard too.

				I have went to 5 Bonnaroo&#039;s including the first two and this year&#039;s line-up was by far the best line-up of any festival in the last 40 years. I went to Rothbury (Electric Forest) the first year (I believe,) and the line-up was awful. It had an organized mix of a line-up. For example; that overrated- frat-jam-folkster Dave Matthews with Snoop Doggy Dogg (who couldn&#039;t even remember what city he was in.) Also, I had friends who said &quot;you have to see the Drive-by Truckers...oh man!&quot; So I went to see them at that Rothbury, it was the worst show ever. Rothbury&#039;s set up is very cool though... would go again if it wasn&#039;t so jammy/dub oriented. <br /><br />What I learned from festivals is to pace yourself. Take it easy the first couple of days...focus on the music/shows. Then hit it hard on a day when there isn&#039;t a lot going on (or something really bad ass.) Get Ambien or something to knock you out for a few hours to sleep through the heat and what not... <br /><br />Next festival on my list... South by Southwest. Sending my band&#039;s press kit to them this year... hopefully it works and I can get in free.&nbsp; ;D

I don&#039;t get real fucked up like a lot of people. I have been to 9 festivals and about 200+ other shows. However, Rothbury was a free ticket and I had no idea who was there until I showed up and got the handout they give... so I did pretty much stay fucked up there. There was really no one I wanted to see. Every Bonnaroo I&#039;ve went to, I leave the camp at around noon and don&#039;t return until about 3-4 (depending on who&#039;s playing late-night and what not.) Crashed until around noon once at the movie theatre tent when they were playing Star Wars. People were walking around me in the morning...it was 100 degrees + haha.. There are people who are only at the festivals to score and stumble through the weekend...not I. <br /><br />SXSW, Bonnaroo, Pitchfork, and Coachella are some of the only festivals that really focus on exciting music, in my opinion.

				I remember Frank Sinatra, now its all noise and drugs!<br /><br />Which is great!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Actually Red is excited over our upcoming private festival&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Each year me and the guys (men only shit!) go off to a remote part of the British Isle.<br /><br />When there, we camp out. We bring the bare essentials, some fresh water, waterproof clothes and boots. Shorts and sunglasses. Musical instruments. <br /><br />We prety much live off the land. We buy a lamb from the farmer and eat it. We fish and eat the fish. The bread is made by some farmers wife. Even the butter, we get the farmers buter. <br /><br />We get all the fruit and veg also. Plus some of us know wild mushrooms (no magic, that&#039;s October) and why pay for those when you can find them for free?<br /><br />We banned coke and speed, (no chicks and guys on coke or speed = potenial for trouble) we only allow alcohol, bud, hash, oil, kief and cannabis cakes. Mushrooms, of course. LSD on hand, a few go for that every year but the big night is the communal pot of mushroom tea. <br /><br />MDMA is acceptable also. People think its for raves only, or D&amp;B events. Actually, its great outdoors around a fire with a few good friends.<br /><br />A few benzos just in case someone goes el loco a bit&nbsp; :) Well, we are hardly going to take someone to the hospital just because they cannot handle some hallucinagenics. 2mg of UK pharm Valium by Roche is at hand. 10mg of that, you can rescue someone caught up in a bad trip. Thats all they would do at the hospital, maybe with IV but we are miles from nowhere and when we are tripping we have chased down a few who have ran! We got torches. The nearest pub would be about 30 miles away. <br /><br />We roam around, explore and check up on a few plants we like&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />The other festival we do, cannot say where, but I got a buddy who is into synchronised firework displays. The shit is set to music. Again, out come the mushrooms sometimes&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I tend to find a spot far from the crowd. You cannot smoke a joint in the UK without someone crying about it! But, on a serious note, there are children and Red does not take drugs around children. Its not a drug friendly festival situation. Plus, you really cannot smoke most bud within a quarter mile radius of any cop. Cops see people smoking by them as taking the piss. <br /><br />So, if your going to a festival, get that canine proof &#039;new&#039; wrapping for your bud, hash and any other drug which has a distictive odour!<br /><br />And remember, there are cops at festivals. Most are just there for the odd bit of trouble. Some are there for drugs! Mostly selling but if you are young and prety &#039;open&#039; about drugs, be more cautious. <br /><br />And hello to anyone working a night shift right now.<br /><br />We just watched some nature shows about wolves. Fantastic creatures. But off topic I guess. Plus, nice as they are we&#039;d shoot them with a licensed shotgun if any attacked. No that we got any near us. We&#039;re all just talking about it. Basically talking shit after smoking that good old Atlas2012 hash, plus The Scurvy Crew Pakistani hash. <br /><br />Slow night at work&nbsp; ;D

				Plenty of good DJs at American festivals, you just have to look past the pop bull shit. The Neon Garden at EDC was fucking slamming this year with awesome tunes and proper DJs. I will say UMF is a shit fest though. It&#039;s basically a giant frat party. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend either heading to Europe and Ibiza or BPM fest in Mexico. If you can&#039;t afford that, than DEMF or Wavefront are pretty good. Insomniac is starting to hookup the tech and proper house lineups at their festivals though, so lots of good stuff every few months in CA.

				UMF has lots hot college girls doing drugs.&nbsp; That&#039;s good in my book.&nbsp; I actually like much of the music as well.&nbsp; Don&#039;t hate.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably enjoy a lot of other festivals as well.<br /><br />What amazes me is how many college kids are able to afford the event.&nbsp; They had what, 350,000 attendees this year?<br /><br />oh and the fact that the police didn&#039;t come in and bust people except for a handful of small drug charges is pretty cool.

All Good in a couple weeks is going to be insanity; I love seeing Pretty Lights outdoors, and he&#039;s playing right after Furthur. His beats are headie, and his samples are rich and oldie; full of soul. <br /><br />Not much of a Bassnectar fan though. There&#039;s only so many songs with that robotic bass noise I can take, before I&#039;m like &quot;This is all the same song, with the same drop.&quot; :P<br /><br />To me, the perfect festival is one with a lot of big name headliners from the scene-past; Furthur(Dead), Cheese, Phish (The Three Kings of Jam, imo), DMB, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Robert Plant, Tom Petty, or whatever other classic rock, or psychedelic rock artist of the past is currently on tour. With some good independent music, and tastefully assorted EDM artists as the day time and late night performers. <br /><br />I hate being bombarded with house beats and/or heavy dub step in the blazing sun... I&#039;d rather be listening to something chill. Save the bass-drops for after midnight.

				I sell at events occasionally, but I&#039;ve been taking it slow since I&#039;m relatively new to it. Most I&#039;ve brought is an oz, an that was just once, every other time i usually bring like 10g to an a half oz. Enough to get a couple hundo maybe to help me travel back home or wherever. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;d really bring more than an oz unless i had a small crew to help me move it, which is a possibility next season. <br />I also try to take care of it in shifts, or just knock out all the selling in one day. At Waka I tried to sell my shit the first day, and NO ONE was buying, i got there early so i was walking around and everyone was too busy setting their shit up. Sure enough though the next day I sold out within like two hours. It was amazing shit though so i figured it&#039;d go quick. The best was the dude who had a test kit. I saw his neighbors peeking over, and as soon as they saw the color reaction they came over and asked to get as much as they could. <br /><br />Im thinking about bringing my own test kit next year

				Go to a state like Florida and just 10g of a phenethylamine such as MDMA or 2C-B is considered trafficking with a minimum mandatory sentence of years in prison.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t hear about any busts at UMF but if you get caught then the penalty is severe.&nbsp; Maybe there are safe ways to sell but I&#039;m pretty clueless on how that&#039;s possible.

I would be surprised if more than 5% of the people didnt get fucked up. I found a guy with some AMAZING LSD that made me trip for a solid 12 hours from 1 dose with a nice and slow transition to peak and then back down. Also I got to try Cherry Cola(MDA), Opium and candy flipping for the first times. Managed to ground score a bowl and over $200 worth of ketamine. Also my friend saved some kids life as the staff members were around him watching him die on the ground and doing nothing, not even calling EMTs. Fucking scum.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />my god, Camp was fucking epic this year.<br /><br />please tell me you watched the disco biscuits....<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hell yes. Thursday was an amazing way to set the festi off with Koan Sound &gt; KJ Sawka &gt; Umphrey&#039;s McGee &gt; STS9 &gt; Biscuits &gt; Dillon Francis &gt; Boys Noize. Was really hoping they would get the light shows from both the stages on the last night. I loved how pretty much all artists played diverse sets with lots of genres being throw down. The most impressive set for me was Dirtyphonics&#039; live set on the last night. Was not expecting how good they were.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So as pissed as I was that I had to miss Boyz Noise, YOU fucked up missing Squarepusher.<br /><br />*Both* times I&#039;ve seen him perform, I&#039;ve walked away saying that was the best set of music I&#039;d ever experienced.

				To all those who post in this thread... I am noticing a LOT of under cover DEA hitting festivals this summer.&nbsp; Three for three for me, in fact, all of which were mentioned by others(or myself) here - having made large amounts of money or smuggling large quantities of drugs into last year.<br /><br />Under Covers happen at festivals, especially those that happen year after year and gain popularity. But not usually DEA... fake hippies w/ long hair... etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />We need to be safe, and smart, if we&#039;re going to be on the winning side of the war on drugs.&nbsp; Have had a couple close-calls this summer, but I&#039;m sure not all of you have the cop-mentality and know how to spot an undercover.&nbsp; This comes from years of dealing drugs in urban environments that are commonly infiltrated by under cover police.<br /><br />Simplest solution... to stop talking about the good festivals, to keep them good.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Peace!

				hey PlanB, you should have no problems at Bestival - but for your safety I would just let you know that you should have everything stashed away even before you get to the ferry as there is a lot of hoop jumping to get thru before you even get to the festival.&nbsp; With blotter you might want to look into splitting it up and stashing it in unusual but tight and hard to get to places such as behind your phones battery or camera battery etc. Security aren&#039;t going to be that thorough.&nbsp; At least with blotter it isn&#039;t going to get smelt by the dogs and is very easy to hide! you should have no problems at all...

Yeah gunna wear some shorts with zippy pockets as well to avoid and nosey hands going down my pockets. Luckily sniffer dogs should&#039;nt be to much of a worry for me as I only have LSD not MDMA or Weed.<br />The last thing I&#039;m worried about is undercover security in the festival grounds, but I&#039;m just going to be super vigilant not blatant with my selling. What&#039;s the best way to go out and find business guys as I&#039;ve never sold at a festival?<br />Is it going round tents saying &quot;Anyone want Lucy/Acid&quot; it ear wigging to see if people mention it.<br /><br />Regards<br />PlanB 8)

In terms of selling it around the campsite you should be chilled selling it but I wouldn&#039;t run around the main arena trying to sell tabs as theres a lot more chance of security seeing you. Have a great weekend though man I went last year for the second time and it was one of my better UK festival experiences.

				My friend went to Bestival last year, said the LE activity on the way in was a bit much, but they had their things in a smell-proof bag in girlfriend&#039;s crotch and no probs getting through. But not the easiest fest to take dog-sniffable stuff into.<br /><br />Me, it&#039;s GREEN MAN in a week! From folk to psych to techno in the Welsh Mountains, cannot fucking wait. An awesome, beautiful, boutique fest. One of the very best in the UK, and our third consecutive year.<br /><br />PS like gettin&#039; nekkid in the saunas too&nbsp; :D

Going to try and avoid taking MDMA on consecutive days from now on or if I do I will prepare more adequately and probably give 5-HTP a go. I&#039;m sure the 2C-E did me no favors in the serotonin department either and should probably reconsider combing these drugs if I want to avoid feeling like a puppy that had its face stomped on for a few days.

				If I&#039;m at a multiple day event and going to be eating multiple drugs, I usually take a few supplements in the morning, ( multi-vitamin and 5-htp) <br /><br />When it comes to MDMA an MDA, I usually roll one days, take a day off and eat lots of food an chill and then eat more MDMA after the day of rest. I find its better to do that than just straight up eat it two days in a row. <br /><br />Plus I only do that once every two months tops. I don&#039;t eat drugs nearly as much as I used to. In 2010 I ate LSD at least once a week, sometimes eating mushrooms/MDMA and/or LSD also in the same week. <br /><br />Kinda lost the &quot;magic&quot; in MDMA, and LSD was making me one helluva goofy motherfucker, all the time. Physiologically I was totally fine, and I never hit depression or anything, in fact, I was quite a consistently happy guy who traveled quite alot and met a lot of great people. <br /><br />But enough is enough. <br /><br />I&#039;m actually taking a break from festivals for awhile, i&#039;m bummed, but I got a lot of responsibilities I have to take care of. I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll hop on one or two here n there

The deaths of Olivia Rotondo, 20, a University of New Hampshire junior from North Providence, RI, and Jeffery Russ, 23, a Syracuse University graduate from Rochester, ultimately prompting officials to cancel the third day of the event. Both died of an overdose from MDMA, more specifically molly, a more concentrated form of the drug. The Post reports that on Saturday Rotondo told an EMS worker, “I just took six hits of Molly,’’ before collapsing in a seizure and dying.<br />Hours before her death, Rotondo tweeted her excitement about attending the fifth annual Electric Zoo: “The amount of traveling I’ve done today is unreal. Just get me to the damn zoo.&quot; “She was the nicest girl I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing,” Noah Burkholz, a friend who had traveled to the festival with her, told the Times. Her grandfather Henry Rotondo, 73, told the Post, “She was a great kid — that’s all I can tell you.”<br />Police do not believe that Rotondo and Russ knew each other. Russ, who died early Saturday morning, graduated from Syracuse University last year with a degree in information technology. “Now there will be no grandchildren, no nieces, no nephews, no wedding,” Russ’ father, John Russ, told the Daily News. “Everything you look forward to in life is gone because of one pill.”<br />Police say that the four concertgoers who also became critically ill due to drug use are expected to recover. In addition to all that, a 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and 31 people were arrested for offenses including drug sales, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of controlled substances. Many criticized the lax security and the lack of medical staff; one concertgoer told us that it took several hours to get Russ from the festival to the hospital. “You saw a lot of people puking and collapsing down and laying on the ground,” 19-year-old Christopher Stuebbe told the Times.<br />While some lashed out at Bloomberg and organizers for canceling events on Sunday, others defended the culture of the event. &quot;I don&#039;t think EDM culture promotes drug use at all. Young people are experimental by nature because they have no sense of their own mortality,&quot; Leslie Doyle, who has attended Electric Zoo festivals over the years and planned to go on Sunday, wrote us. &quot;Acts of violence would be a good reason to shut down a music festival, there was none of that! This administration reacted to 6 people who made unfortunate personal choices. Their decision to shut down EZoo has tarnished the experience for the collective group of tens of thousands.&quot;<br />&quot;EZoo officials go to great lengths to make this an Eco friendly event, and the DJs make announcements advising people to take care of themselves,&quot; she added. &quot;There will always be a few people that lose control. Shutting down Zoo is one more example of the Bloomberg Administration&#039;s nannyism. When people die of alcohol poisoning, are they going to shut down the restaurants and bars who serve them?&quot; &quot; <br /><br />first of all, molly isnt in hits. either pressed pills, crystals/power, or capsule.. <br />2nd of all aparantly the guy has crystal meth in his pocket.&nbsp; <br />about 90% of people there were FUCKED up. i did meet alot of sober people. <br />i also saw 2 people get randomly searched and 2 people tweakin the fuck out. <br />someone had came up to me and say &quot;yo you want some molly? 40, 60, 80?&quot; <br />who in the RIGHT mind would buy a GRAM of molly and CONSUME it all?????? <br />-_- shit really angers me, and im so fucking glad the silk road exists, to make sure im getting the real product. test kits are a helper too:]

				Back from TomorrowWorld! Left Sunday morning. I was having difficulty walking plus I had a lot of lower back pain. I had seen who I wanted to see. I arrived in Dreamville around 7:30pm Thursday. Holy FUCK what a long walk that was. Fucking bullshit really. They made us walk what..1-2 miles one way? How exhausting that is when you are partying solo and having to carry everything by yourself.<br /><br />Got my tent and everything set up by like 10:30ish. Headed to the gathering and stayed until the last song. Was pretty dope. Chilled by the tent Friday until the sun started to go down. I went to the Dim Mak stage about an hour or so before Steve Aoki was playing. Walked in and was damn near center stage front row on the rail.&nbsp; I was on some of CC&#039;s speed. Fuck yeah. Went to the main stage after he was done playing and got to see porter robinson, sebastion ingrosso, tiesto, and later benny benassi.<br /><br />Saturday same deal. Hung out by the tent until the sun got lower. Took my chair to the main stage(back problems), sat my ass down in the back and watched the party ensue in front of me. Was able to see calvin harris, axwell, afrojack, and afroki. Axwell&#039;s set was incredible.<br /><br />Not sure if I&#039;d do the 5 day dreamville 3 day ticket thing again unless I went with someone else/a group. Still had a great time.
