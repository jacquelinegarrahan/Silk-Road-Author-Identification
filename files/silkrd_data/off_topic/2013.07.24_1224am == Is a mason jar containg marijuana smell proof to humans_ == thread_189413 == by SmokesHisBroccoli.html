				Like the subject says, I&#039;m just wondering if a brand name good quality mason jar (the type you put the flat lid on and then screw the top on with the pop top in the center) will help conceal 100% of the weed odor to human noses?&nbsp; <br /><br />Also what do you think about rubber banding a couple of dryer sheets over top of the lid? <br /><br />Finally, I hear freezer bags are pretty good in terms of concealing odor and while they&#039;re not 100%, I was thinking of either putting my bud in a bag inside the mason jar OR putting the mason jar inside of a bag.&nbsp; Which would be better?

				They can be quite good at hiding the scent, yes, but I wouldn&#039;t say 100%. I would keep it well wrapped in an airtight baggie inside a mason jar, but eventually in my experience SOME smell is going to escape the jar so I wouldn&#039;t count on this as being a feasible solution for the long term if you need it to stay totally smell free.

				Mason jars are pretty good, but dank bud, you will be able to smell it through the lid if you&#039;re up close. And especially if it&#039;s in a closed area such as a fridge or cabinet.

				Ah right, if you put it in a closed space like a cabinet, you will smell it, at least when you first open the cabinet. You might need something like cVaults for that.

				Alright after spending some more time on the internet looking for other solutions, here&#039;s what I have come up with.&nbsp; <br /><br />First, I double vacuum seal the bud (going to take a shortcut and use cheap ziplock hand held vacuum start kit for like $3 as opposed to a food saver since this isn&#039;t for long term storage).&nbsp; Next I take some baking soda and pour some of it into the bottom of the mason jar.&nbsp; Then I close the mason jar up and rubber band some dryer sheets to the top.&nbsp; Finally I keep the open box of baking soda in the cabinet along with a couple of dryer sheets.&nbsp; <br /><br />So basically my original plan but adding some vacuuming sealing and baking soda which seems like a good odor neutralizer.

				it helps if you vacuum seal it - one way, the way the folks that can food, is to place the jars (with the mj already in it) in a pot of hot water, immersing about 75-80% of the jar (they make special tools that look like large pliers to handle the jars with) - basically you&#039;re heating the air in the jar, then when you put the lid on tight, and then when the jar cools, the air inside cools and contracts (becomes denser air) and that pulls the lid&#039;s seal down even tighter<br /><br />they also make an adaptor for the lid with a small hand operated vacuum pump. A lot of folks in the tobacco forums like to cure their tobacco in mason jars and this is what they do
