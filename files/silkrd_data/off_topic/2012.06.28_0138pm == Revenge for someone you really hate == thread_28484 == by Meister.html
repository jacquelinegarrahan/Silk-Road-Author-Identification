				We had tons of these threads months back, full of Lim&#039;s guide to striping a mother fucker lol. But I was just told a story last night that reminded me of all the revenge ploys. Guy was getting back at his ex girlfriends new boyfriend, so he took all the lug nuts off his wheel except 1, that one required the special key to get off. Dude drove off in his car, the wheel broke off and he skidded his way into someones front yard and had to have his car towed from there. His car is completely fucked, rear axle broke off concrete chunks on the sidewalk.<br /><br />Obviously a serious revenge ploy, could possibly kill the person if they got on the highway, or someone else, but was effective nonetheless!

				That&#039;s what makes driving so exciting. People take it for granted, but sky diving isn&#039;t so extreme, how many people die sky diving? Try going 90mph in a convertible and have Grandma No Blinker cut you off doing 50 in a 70, extremeeee brooo

				I never thought I&#039;d share this with anyone but this is SR, so I will.<br />This works best in apartments with rear patios. I won&#039;t admit to whether or not this has been successful ;)<br /><br />Hate your neighbor or the person you hate lives in an apartment? Typically, you can access their back patio with ease, just a hop over a 4ft concrete wall or short fence. Don&#039;t worry, you won&#039;t be there long.<br />Cost: $20.<br /><br />Go to the local smoke shop and pick up &quot;a rose&quot; which is a crack pipe. Score a small amount of crack. ($5 baby rock). Let a bum/crackhead smoke 3/4th of the rock for you in the pipe. Residue is there now.<br />Now, place the pipe with 1/4th remaining crack rock, onto his patio, preferred on the patio table if there is one, but maybe a chair or whatever. Adding other drugs might help too. Now for the fucked up part.<br /><br />Call the police from someone else&#039;s phone, and tell them you want to make an anonymous report. A young child (12-14, and be descriptive of this young made up person. I think males work best for this) was offered a hit of crack cocaine from a known crackhead in the apartment complex. The cops WILL come out, tell them you saw the guy acting weird and the kid took off in a weird way or that the kid ran to you for safety and said that guy offered him a hit of rock and talked about liking young boys/sex talk etc. You see where I&#039;m going with this. You need to show them where you saw the offer take place, or where the &#039;kid said&#039; it took place so they can find the burnt in pipe.<br /><br />They will arrest him, he might be kicked out of the complex for drugs, sexual solicitation to a minor, or a host of other reasons. He may also be charged if he does indeed test positive for cocaine, if they test him. That&#039;s the thing, he will deny it and say he wants a drug test. I&#039;ll leave it up to your imagination on how you could convince a cop on this but it&#039;s not hard because the guy already has so many false strikes against him in the eyes of the cops who just showed up to get a crackhead pedophile. This method is only for severe hate, not for your typical neighbor argument. This one has to be really serious because it can forever change a life and sometimes we over react as humans. <br /><br /><br />Method #2: not so dangerous but really fun. Acquire &quot;skunk essence&quot;. This is the oil skunks output that smells. It smells good to me but most people can&#039;t stand it. I personally love it. Anyway, you go to the guy you hate&#039;s car, using a valve stem removal tool, you take the stem out (just unscrew the metal stem insert, not the whole stem) and using a needle or medicine dropper, put a good amount of skunk essence in the tire. Or all the tires if possible. Leave the stems out if you desire, it&#039;s going to be flat anyway. Now, the fun part... when they try to change the tire, they are like WTF? I hit a skunk or some shit, wtf? But then they realize they have 3-4 flat tires and maybe that they&#039;re missing the stems. This usually prompts a police call, a tow truck/insurance call and a trip to the tire shop. 9/10 times the tire shop will be like &quot;dude, what the fuck, you have skunk piss in your tires&quot;. Now they don&#039;t really want to work with this because it will &#039;stain&#039; their equipment and leave residue all over their business. <br /><br />Just slightly outside the box.<br /><br />Happy revenging.<br />Skunk Essence can be had on ebay for about $50 for enough to do a few cars. <br /><br />Edit: If you do an anonymous report, suggest there was a witness and describe yourself on the phone and say something like &quot;I think he lives right by the guy&quot;. They will almost always ask the neighbors if they heard/seen anything. ;)

				Supervisor at a place I used to work was a total dick. I was assistant super. People had had enough of his shit and one night someone threw a handful of taco sauce packets in a microwave and turned the timer to max and walked out. The people in the shop said,&quot;MMMMM smells like enchiladas.&quot; About 10 minutes later someone came running out saying the microwave was on fire. There were like 60 people on the shift so no one knew who did it. He tried to get the person to confess by calling a meeting. Later management offered a reward for information. When the issue couldn&#039;t be resolved the office decided he couldn&#039;t control his shift and was fired.<br /><br />Worked with a guy that liked to talk shit behind people&#039;s backs and fuck with their machines at work. One day I made a poster 3&#039;x5&#039; that said, &quot;I (HEART) Black Dick&quot; and taped it to the passenger side of his truck. He drove through town and people were laughing and pointing at him. He didn&#039;t find it until he got home and needless to say he never said shit to me ever again.

				I mean if you REALLY hate someone, you&#039;d just want them dead right?<br /><br />Syringe full of insulin will probably do the trick.
