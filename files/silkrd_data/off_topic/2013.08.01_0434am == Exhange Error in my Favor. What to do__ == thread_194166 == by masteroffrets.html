Without thinking i bought coins instantly and withrew before i could think twice. Ive now realised what i did was illlegal but its like the hardest decision in my life wether to give the money back.

				How this is the &quot;Hardest decision for you&quot;.... say&#039;s a lot about who you are( a total piece of shit, scumbag, no good lying loser).<br /><br />Just because you do drugs does not mean you have to be a scumbag thief. This should be an easy decision!!! Do the right thing.<br /><br />It makes no difference that this is a big company or an individual....the bottom line is you know that is not your money. A mistake was made.<br /><br />I do not know why you wasted your time making this post....what do you want...a lot of other broke dick losers telling you that it is ok and that you will not get prosecuted? CLEARLY your only motivation is that you do not want to get into trouble...because you do not give a fuck about doing the right thing.<br /><br />I hope that Karma bites you in the ass and you are someone that gets fucked by this right away. And I hate the &quot;cops&quot; but in this case...I hate your ass more.<br /><br />GO FUCK YOURSELF. I hope you overdose with the drugs you buy. I actually hope worse but it is Wednesday still where I am, and I am nice to losers on Wednesday&#039;s. If this was Thursday I would really tell you how I feel.

				I go to the bank last week and they say they dont know what im talking about, the correct amount was deducted from my account. i had to explain to the idiots that they may have deducted the right amount, but they sent 10x the amount. Then they are like oh ok were gonna have to fix that. NO apology, not even a thank you for letting us know. I had to wait like 3 days after that for me to be able to use MY coins. I wish i held onto them till they realized it, I could have made a solid profit. Pretty fed up with this place everytime i do a wire i have to wait an hour for somebody to help me.. Everyone is so unprofessional there. Their male tellers dont even were ties! I had to were a tie when i worked at a fuckin grocery store. <br /><br />If a vendor sent me the same thing twice like you hear about on here it would depend on the situation but i might not tell them. Like when you hear about somebody getting the same package like 2 weeks later. That makes it clear the vendor is keeping your address and is running a pretty sloppy operation. If you dont take my safety seriously than fuck you im keeping your shit. And if a vendor sent me wayy more than i ordered like your saying alighier&nbsp; thats a risk to my security that i wasn&#039;t going to take and the vendor put your safety in major jeopardy. fuck him id keep it.

				You wont get any thanks for returning the cash and seeing as it was their mistake you cannot get prosecuted.They can only ask you to return it.Its up to you whether you do but if it were the other way around they would hold onto your money for as long as they could.Fuck the banks.All they do is fuck us so if and when you get a chance to fuck them,I say do it.<br />It would be different if say someone left their wallet on the bus or your employer over payed you ect ect but we are talking about a huge organization that would fuck you over(and probably does)every chance it got.

				I thought what you said and was gonna keep the money but a quick google search showed me different. It most deffinitly IS illegal to keep the money and their are TONS of articles on google of people being charged with felony grand larceny after spending money the bank incorrectly deposited into there account.

				If I had find the money or I knew who the money came from I would give it back just out of morality.<br /><br />BUT! If it was a bank mistake.. No way I would give the money back. I mean come on! The banks are the main reason why this world is so unfair, fucked, and consuming. You did a big mistake my friend. Especially if the amount was big!<br /><br />

				Cuz they would have caught it eventually and thrown me in the slammer. Now i dont know if i would get in trouble if used it to make money and then returned it. <br /><br />&quot;Take Randy and Melissa Marie Pratt, whose perceived windfall turned into jail time, when they took an erroneous bank deposit and ran. Melissa made a bank deposit to FNB Bank in the summer of 2008 of $1,772.50, but the bank read the check as $177,250. When the central Pennsylvania couple saw the difference in their bank balance, they wrote checks to another account, quit their jobs, bought a new vehicle and moved to Orlando, Fla. They were in the process of buying a house before the bank deposit mistake was traced.<br /><br />When a New Zealand bank worker mistakenly changed Leo Gao&#039;s overdraft limit this May from $62,000 (USD) to $6.2 million (USD; NZ $10 million), he and his girlfriend withdrew $2.3 million, closed their failing gas station and fled to Hong Kong, where the police pursued them. The couple is still on the run and have developed an online following, inspiring Facebook fan groups as well as a parody song on YouTube.<br /><br />James Falzone made a bank deposit of $630 at Barnett Bank in New Port Richey, Fla., back in May 1985; a teller marked the bank deposit as $63,000. Falzone withdrew $47,000 four days later and paid off his MasterCard debt and some loans from Barnett and other banks (hey, at least he was financially responsible, right?). He was charged with grand theft.<br /><br />In 2000, Susan R. Madakor received bank deposits of $701,998. Foreign governments were trying to contribute to a United Nations environmental program account that was one digit off from Madakor&#039;s Chase Manhattan Bank account. Madakor, from Brooklyn, claimed she believed she won an international lottery and had spent about $250,000 to invest in a laundry business, set up a college fund for her son, pay off credit card debt, and lease a minivan before Chase realized the bank deposit error and froze the account. Madakor&#039;s request to a State Supreme Court judge that the assets be unfrozen was denied. She was later convicted of bank larceny and bank fraud, sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to Chase.<br /><br />When Herbert Starbird from Altoona, Pa., found an erroneous bank deposit of $280,276 in his First Commonwealth Bank account in October 2007, he spent more than half the money before the bank contacted him. He said he only spent the money because First Commonwealth told him it wasn&#039;t a bank deposit mistake. The bank said they never told Starbird the money was his, and he never contacted the bank. Starbird faces civil charges as well as criminal charges of theft and receiving stolen property. This February, Starbird expressed anger to the Altoona Mirror that the charges were deterring him from getting work and once again stated his belief that the money was his, saying, &quot;I paid every bill I owed. I took care of my kids, my family and everything. I wasn&#039;t extravagant.&quot; In early November, his attorney requested a dismissal of the criminal charges.<br /><br />Moral of these stories: Getting an erroneous bank deposit is not the same as winning the lottery. It&#039;s not mystery money. It&#039;s theft. And that holds true whether you&#039;re pocketing an erroneous bank deposit of $2 million or $2. Just because it was the bank&#039;s error doesn&#039;t mean you have an excuse.&quot;
