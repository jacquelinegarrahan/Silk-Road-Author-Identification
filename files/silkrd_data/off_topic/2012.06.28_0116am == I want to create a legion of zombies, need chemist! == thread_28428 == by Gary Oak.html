				Alright, so I&#039;ve always dreamed of living in a zombie apocalypse but it&#039;s always been just a dream. However, I believe we&#039;re closer to reaching my goal as science and technology progresses. I think I may have found the key to creating a genuine zombie, but need a chemist to do so. Is there anyone out there that think they can successfully combine MDPV with Krokodil? Every news report of a modern zombie has been under the influence of MDPV, as well as every picture I&#039;ve seen of the disastrous effects of Krokodil reminds me of the decaying flesh of the undead. Any thoughts? ???

But SHIT THE FUCKING BED that is the STUPIDEST thing I have EVER heard BAR FUCKING NONE. If I was in charge of a country where people where people were GENUINELY worried about some sort of Zombie Apocalypse occurring just because there had been an unusually high amount of nutters trying to eat people and occasionally fuck a corpse around the world I would punish them by NOT announcing that the Zombie Apocalypse had not happened and just let them lock themselves in their houses out of paranoia. If they are that stupid they shouldn&#039;t be allowed out into society anyway. Christ, this is yet another thing that is being discussed today where I have to say I have a certain amount of sympathy for retards but that sympathy only goes so far. I can say with certainty that this has crossed that line and is now so far past that line it&#039;s gone over the horizon and I can&#039;t even see it anymore. Which I am glad about because it means now I can&#039;t see it anymore I can forget it ever existed and crossed that line. <br /><br />And yes, this is stupid enough that it deserved that paragraph of a rant.
