				Okay so , my vendor didn&#039;t ship my order like he told me he was going to do three days in a row it was,<br />&nbsp;&quot;I promise I&#039;ll get it to you tomorrow&quot;, <br />we kept in contact and I told him it was all good and I know shit happens(his shipment was late) . He offered to cancel order or overnight it when his product came&nbsp; and hook me up big time.&nbsp; I told him I would wait it out until end of week&nbsp; and if he didn&#039;t have his product then I would like to cancel . So this Wednesday&nbsp; had msg from vendor asking for my info again cause he accidentally deleted . re sent my address. Later that same afternoon went to check mail and BAM what do you know there is my order with 6 extra pills and that made me happy. I thought to myself he must of messaged wrong person since I got mine. Meanwhile that evening I finalized.&nbsp; Well I check mail yesterday and whatta ya know there is my order again minus the 6 extra. <br /><br />Do I say something ?? or did he mean to do that? I want to tell myself he meant to so I won&#039;t feel obligated to pay. I honestly don&#039;t have another 400.00 laying around. Both my hot water heaters went out this week and my gas cook top, $2000.00&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I wait and see if he says something? I mean if he kept his tracking numbers and figured out what he did&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to look like the asshole who didn&#039;t say anything, or if he does say something I could play stupid and be like I thought that was you hooking me up big time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Thoughts????

				First off, congratulations, you hit the drug lottery! Second, it can&#039;t hurt to let the vendor know. You don&#039;t owe him and if you can&#039;t afford to pay it is what it is. If you are compelled to compensate the vendor for their mistake maybe mention it to them and send them some coin when you can. Chances are they will say not to worry about it and your honesty will be recognized and you will have a vendor who takes care of you in the future... <br /><br />Honesty is usually the best way to go.

				You should probably tell him.&nbsp; He may have other orders with other customers that have been messed up, and he needs to know how badly he&#039;s messed up to fix it.&nbsp; That way he won&#039;t accuse everyone of trying to scam him.

				yes that is what my gut is telling me. If I was a vendor I would appreciate knowing ,but wouldn&#039;t expect to be paid. I will tell him and hopefully he won&#039;t expect much , cause he aint gonna get it. Sounds awful but that&#039;&#039;s how it is.

				Tell him, it would be the right thing to do. Its not on you. that he shipped it twice. You are not forced to pay him, but if you have any spare coin, or whenever you have it, if you FEEL like givin some to him, i guess he will will most likelly appreciate that.

				He probably meant to do it. When my customers had issues I hook them up to compensate for it. Hell the other day I made 30 gram bags instead of 20 and I didn&#039;t feel like putting the extra up so I just went ahead and tossed them in people&#039;s envelopes. No one said anything because I guess they thought it was a mistake, but truth is I was just fucking lazy and rather had give them out then put them back.

				DrMDA, I would be ordering from you if I wasn&#039;t so happy with my MDMA vendor. Last time I ordered MDA, it never arrived and I ordered more than a little bit and broke a cardinal rule. Sad memories.

				I have had this happen before with just normal shit like car parts, never said a fucking word to the seller. But if it happened here I would probably let them know just to find out for sure. I have to much respect for what GOOD vendors do here and value my relationship with said Good vendors too much to let something like this possibly cause an issue.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=208802.msg1505381#msg1505381">Quote from: oddthomas on August 30, 2013, 07:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Do I say something ?? or did he mean to do that?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To me it doesnt sound like he meant to just to hook you up. If that is all it was then why not just ship it all together?<br /><br />Only way to know for sure is to check with them though.<br /><br />If they do want some payment just explain that you cant pay such a large unexpected amount and set something up.

				I received a double order once, though it was all in one package. Told the vendor, he said &quot;you&#039;re welcome, sorry for the 2 day delay&quot;! It was only common cheap RC&#039;s, but still. Doesn&#039;t ever happen irl, now does it?

				I will say this. Be a good person. SR needs good people. Let him know what happen. Even if you do not have the money to pay him right away for the extra, just consider it a front, and be honest and good to your word. When you are able to, pay him back for the additional order for the price you would normally pay. That way everything balances out. <br /><br />Though, as I type this I assume you are reselling in real life and will be making the money to pay him back. If you were buying for personal use and don&#039;t have extra money to do this... well, all I can say is make the best decision. If the vendor trusts you, you could always offer to work with him and help him fulfill his next order by sending those free pills you got out to the next person who orders. Sometimes these things happen... and for the road to be a good safe place to get drugs, it needs good people in the community.

				Still haven&#039;t heard anything from person. I am not going to offer to pay ,but if he asked nicely if&nbsp; there was something I could do . The best I can say is I would mail him some cash, cause my SR wallet is empty and its to expensive/hassle to load. but even then I can&#039;t pay full price up front&nbsp; I mean I could send a $20 here and there till he&#039;s satisfied.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not re-selling, these were/are for personal use. I get a normal script from Dr. but those run out and last time askd Dr for larger script he went all &quot; these are addictive drugs rant&quot; so I don&#039;t ask anymore. I left him a glowing review on his discuss page. Would do it on here but it would be to easy for someone to figure out who vendor is. (Don&#039;t know if they&#039;d care) but don&#039;t want to put their business out there.

				I think you should tell the vendor.<br />Chances are, they sent someone elses order to you by mistake and someone else will miss out.<br /><br />I have done this before. The buyer told me and we worked out a good resolution and also someone missed out on their order.<br />I usually would have thought they might be a scammer, but because I knew someone else got 2 orders, I knew I was in the wrong. <br />I ended up reshipping their order and adding in some extra because of the delay and the person who got 2 orders paid 40% of the normal price for the bonus order.<br />Worked out well for everyone in the end, especially considering I was at fault.
