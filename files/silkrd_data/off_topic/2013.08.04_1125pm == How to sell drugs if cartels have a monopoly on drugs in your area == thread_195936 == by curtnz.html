				so the cartels here run the drugs around here. the street gangs buy it from the bigger cartels and then they distribute. but if you are buying drugs from the silk road and obviously the product on silkroad is better than what we have locally, how do we make a dollar without the cartels catching feelings? obviously they&#039;ll be seeing less profits so they&#039;ll know something is up. do you guys just end up making your own gangs up locally just in case the cartels come looking for you?

				If you want to create a gang so the cartels don&#039;t fuck with you, then you&#039;re going to need to make a powerful gang. I wouldn&#039;t fuck with the cartels honestly. You can still sell small time enough to where they wont even notice.<br /><br />Sell MDMA. I don&#039;t know about where you live but no one would fucking buy MDMA from a gang banger where I live.

				CanCru hit it dead on, sell rolls then - We are deep in the shit (gang wise) and conduct business IRL &amp; on SR selling XTC pills<br /><br />Rollers and Ravers are a different clientele &amp; not likely to piss in your pond and are generally nicer as cartels and gangs are not going to tolerate it<br /><br />Think locally act globally&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I don&#039;t know what to say then. MDMA and Psychs would be your best bet. You don&#039;t have to get huge, just flipping an ounce of MDMA from here every 2-3 weeks probably wont bring too much attention to you. But what do I know? As far as I know the cartel doesn&#039;t handle the sale of MDMA at all in my area, they mostly just sell Meth and Heroin.

				Don&#039;t make a crew, you&#039;ll end up dead or in jail.<br />Instead, rent a bulletproof server in Russia. Now advertise local drug mail delivery or drop. Run a clearnet site and accept bitcoins only.<br /><br />There&#039;s ways to advertise locally (stickers and poster guys, local forums, facebook/twitter) without compromising your identity. You can never fight cartels or other established gangs it&#039;s not worth it. There was an upstart crew of delivery drivers here who decided they would start jacking cartel lines. The upstart guy&#039;s were far more scary than the cartel dudes, and a huge war erupted with daytime brazen shootings all over the place and in the end every single member of that upstart crew is doing life in prison or dead. That&#039;s your future if you start an organized crew and violently take over. These upstart guy&#039;s were all ex cons and serious about game security too, and had corrupt gang taskforce members on their payroll yet they still failed. <br /><br />You could start your own delivery line but eventually somebody will leak it to the wrong people and they&#039;re gonna put a gun in your face and demand a tax. Then the war begins. You could approach them with your product and try to work out a deal but they&#039;re cartel thugs so unlikely you&#039;ll get the winning part of the deal. Cartels are full of rats anyways and heatbags, I wouldn&#039;t trust any of them.<br />

I think trying to fly under the radar would be much easier and safer.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I did it in a city for 2 years and the site is still operating I sold it. <br />I would go into club bathrooms and post up stickers, and had ads posted up beside concert posters but they didn&#039;t outright offer drugs, it was more subtle. I also used facebook/twitter/forums/topix and other social media.<br /><br />I also sold to english language students through a method I don&#039;t want to advertise, and to every single tourist that came into town that I also don&#039;t want to advertise. It can be done. It&#039;s risky as hell, but less risky than driving around delivering drugs with both cops and cartels after you. Everybody snitches/grasses you out no matter how low key you think your operation is. My city is full of jacking gangsters, I did this in 2008 when the shit hit the fan too and bodies were dropping every weekend and all crews were at war and street dealers were disappearing. Even highschool kids dealing tiny amounts were being found killed. Then a huge police roundup happened and like 400+ guys got arrested in a single night and are still in jail waiting trial, many of them already pleaded out to life. <br /><br />The heat was so bad guys were making more money being hired hitman than delivery drivers. The partner who I sold my share of the site to told me escort agencies are now using him for sourcing for clients looking for something extra, and he (stupidly) now has drivers too to drop off at hotels, but I would never do that. Guess it&#039;s less heat now with all the crazy thugs off the street but there will be new thugs.<br /><br />Escorts are a good resource. Anonymously contact them and offer them a referral percentage for johns looking to get high. DJs and event promoters are another good resource. They have guys selling at events, become their supplier. Send them free stuff to try. Works everytime. Depends on your city though, the heat involved and amount of crazy gangsters running around with guns. There&#039;s also no reason to deal locally, Asia is desperate for good drugs. Lot&#039;s of partying going on in Philippines and Japan. Crews there looking for good connects of MDMA and coke. My friend has half his shipments dropped off in Jakarta on his way to North America and is making so much money he might not even sell here anymore. <br /><br />Here&#039;s something I used to do but don&#039;t anymore. I would go on local craigslist and make (anonymous) posts asking for Molly, asking for Lucy, asking for Tina, asking for 420 ect. I would never directly advertise I had goods to sell because people will rat you out, but if you make a post asking for it and to contact you it doesn&#039;t get flagged for some reason.<br /><br />Other people see this, and start making posts themselves, and then you reply and sell to them. So you create the market on that site. I also would get 20+ replies from people asking if I found anybody, to let them know because they were looking too. Another trick was to go on foreign language sites and directly advertise my service back home to tourists. These were travel websites, and it worked well. I then started using another method which brought in all the tourists. Another thing we tried which was hugely successful was advertising on gay forums, gay nightclub info sites, and approaching people who worked in bath houses. All those guys looking for quality party drugs and they don&#039;t want to deal with gangsters. Most of our sales went to a guy who ran a gay bath house and something about the gay community, they don&#039;t rat each other out so he was never busted. He&#039;s still selling over the counter and selling my old sites dope.<br /><br />I also paid a girl I found on a nude beach to sell weed and other drugs to other nudists. She buried the drugs in the sand, would dig them up and sell them. She still does it and no cartel guys go down there, police don&#039;t even go down there. It started out with her just handing out flyers for our drop, then she just started selling directly.

Black market extortion is like their third biggest income after meth and coke. IRL trade is hard to do navigating the cut throat waters of cops and extortion rackets. A local gangster who was killed here last year did this interview where he talked about how easy it is to get sucked into the G lifestyle. You start out with a few drivers, then more, and pretty soon your competition is like &quot;who are these guys? let&#039;s kill them before they get too big and take us over&quot; and that&#039;s it you&#039;re now officially a G getting shot at and planning hits when all you wanted to do was make some money delivering product. Even if you have a long term successful lines every few years some idiot tries to put together a supercrew to take over everything with force. <br /><br />Every 8-10 years there is a major shakeup of the local trade when new fools try to violently takeover. They create total chaos, all end up dead or in jail and then peace for another 8-9yrs until a new breed of morons comes up to try it again. Usually this war is started when cops do a big bust, equilibrium in the blackmarket shifts and the status quo appears weak so the new supercrew jumps in to takeover and war begins. Or you live in Chicago or Atlanta and it&#039;s war 24/7. Forget local biz in that situation, find a guy in Philippines who wants drugs and ship it to him from your security cleared western country. Let the idiots here fight over scraps while your boatload of liquid coke filled rope drops off an entire container there every month and you never have to deal with guns in your face or cops (if you stay off the phone).<br /><br />
