				I think dreams are some of the most interesting and pleasurable experiences. Best of all, they are free. So what are some dreams that you found to be especially interesting or pleasant? Or, if you want, your worst nightmares?<br />I&#039;ll start, with a dream I had like 2 days ago:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I was at my grandma&#039;s apartment and she asked me to look out the window. I look out and I see everything had changed. The six-lane boulevard had turned into train tracks and and a two lane road. The shitty commie blocks on the other side were gone and a very beautiful residential neighborhood was being built. <br />My grandma told me she bought 2 parcels of land which she gave to the developer under the promise that he would sell me a house for 20,000 euros (a ridiculous price for a house like that). I felt extremely happy because I knew I would never have to get into debt for my house. So I go down to inspect it closer, but a train had just stopped in front of me and i could not get on the other side. <br />I figured I just had to get on the train and get out on the other side to get to the new residential neighborhood. I hop on the train and for a brief moment I look out the window on the other side. I could not see anything because of a line of trees that was blocking the view. I try to open the door on the other side but it was locked. I tried to get on the other side of the train car to try the other door. However, by the time I get to the other door the train starts. The train then takes me through a foreign landscape that I never seen before. I try to recognize where I am but i can&#039;t. After a train ride that seemed to take around 5 minutes the train stops in a village that I had never seen before.<br />I get off the train, I had no money on me, so I figured it shouldn&#039;t take me more than half an hour to get back home, judging by the fact that the train had not moved very fast. <br />The train station however seemed deserted. I am able to find an info kiosk where a guy that seemed oddly familiar was standing. He was short and fat, with a mustache that may have been fashionable in the twenties.&nbsp; I go to him and say &quot;Excuse me sir, can you please help me with something.&quot; He looks at me and says &quot;Help you? Do you know what happened to the last guy that ask me for help? Yeah, i beat the crap out of him. Haha ask me for help, go figure out your own shit&quot;. At this point I&#039;m thinking what an asshole so I try to find my way out of the train station. The station seemed to have been somewhere underground and there were no exit signs, so it was difficult to find my way out. Eventually I found a dark and narrow staircase which led me outside.<br />As I got out, I felt like i went back in time. The streets were very narrow, there were no cars, only horse drawn carts and people. By the way they dressed they all looked like from the early 1900s. I notice two women in their mid 40s chatting. I walk up to them, they see me and they&#039;re like &quot;Oh here he comes, let&#039;s go!&quot;. I stop them and I say &quot;Please wait, I just want to get back to *city* can you tell me which way?&quot;. One of them just tells me &quot;We don&#039;t know, please just leave us alone!&quot;. So I walk along the street and see signs of places i don&#039;t recognize. I see a couple of kids playing in front of a farm house so i decide to ask them. However, as they see me coming towards them they run away. At this point I become quite desperate as I notice the sun is going down. The village appears to have become deserted. No one was around. I walk further down the street and notice a bridge that was over a river. I go over the bridge and in front of me there was a very beautiful building that looked like it had some administrative purpose. I want to go inside, but i notice a bench near the river bank where a young girl was sitting. I go towards her, expecting her to flee like the others, but she doesn&#039;t. As I get closer I recognize her as my first crush. <br />When I was about 13 years old, this girl was the most popular girl in our school. Every guy wanted to be with her, including me. At the time, I was fat and wore ugly glasses, so obviously I had no chance with her. As I grew older, lost weight, became more attractive, I&#039;ve had a few really hot girlfriends, but this girl remained burned in my brain as the one that got away.<br />So, as i get closer to her, she doesn&#039;t even seem to notice, she was just marveling at the beautiful building in front of her. So I decide to sit next to her and I say: <br />&quot;Natalie (fake name), what are you doing here?&quot; <br />&quot;That&#039;s not important&quot;, she says &quot;You ended up here and no one likes you. You are alone just like you were when you were in love with me and i barely knew you exist. You went down the wrong path and ended up here where you are alone again.&quot; <br />&quot;But i just want to get back home, why doesn&#039;t anyone just show me the way, I don&#039;t want anything from them just to show me the way back home&quot;. <br />&quot;No one is going to show you the way, you just have to find it on your own.&quot;<br />I look down for a few seconds thinking, I want to ask her something else but when i look next to me, she was gone. I get up, determined to find my way home, but it was getting darker and darker. Everything was deserted. As I walk down I hear a voice &quot;Wake up, wake up!&quot; I wake up to my current girlfriend telling me it&#039;s 11 a.m. I knew this was an especially rare dream so i immediately grab a piece of paper and wrote it down.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
