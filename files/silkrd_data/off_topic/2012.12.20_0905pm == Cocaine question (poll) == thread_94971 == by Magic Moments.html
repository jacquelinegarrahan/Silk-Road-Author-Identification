				IV coke is my poison..&nbsp; If I could, I would mix all my shots of coke with dope for good measure.<br /><br /><br />If you haven&#039;t shot coke yet..&nbsp; Don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; You can develop a fixation with it that can spiral out of control very quickly.&nbsp; It&#039;s also a good way to lose friends as well.

				is it possible to be high on coke for like ~2 hours ? I shot coke got massive bellringer and was high for like 2 hrs.<br /><br />At the time i was going to take a bath , made a shot of coke and got in, the water was warm, relaxed and well picked up a needle and injected.. it was nothing nothing and you could feel in your ears some like wind and this noise coming slightly first few seconds but it got stronger and louder and stronger to the point where it felt like the train was passing by my head with that ding ding ding, i though my ears were gonna explode.... that was probably most intense rush ever, I really got scared i thought i overdosed and did not know what was going to happen. This rush lasted for about 10 minutes. just thinking about it i feel strange. After the rush i just chilled, picked up the wet cotton from the spoon and rubbed it into my gums to get them numb... mmm that was one hell of a shot..

				Hey guys, thanks for sharing your experience, We may be a little uninformed, What is a bellringer? Is it a type of needle or something. Or is it like after you shoot it, the bells start to ring in your head?<br />Do you guys mind clearing this up for us. Thanks.<br /><br />MM

				Interesting thread and interesting results. I took a look because I just responded (against) in a thread asking about crack.&nbsp; My advise was to get some high grade blow if he wanted to try coke.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t vote as I am not in the market.

				I realize I&#039;m a bit late to answer the poll but figured I&#039;d put in my 2 cents here anyway. I always sniff, never injected before. Whenever I do coke I MUST smoke cigarettes or I won&#039;t enjoy it nearly as much. So I usually do a line, pull some tobacco out of the cigarette, mix some coke in, twist the end shut, and light up! It really takes the high to another level.
