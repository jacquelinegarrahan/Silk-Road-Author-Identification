				The &quot;exotic&quot; vacation/trips to take ayahuasca under a shaman&#039;s guidance in the Amazon rainforest have been getting more and more popular the last few years. Anybody here in the forums ever go on one?<br /><br />Without compromising your anonymity at all, care to describe it a bit? Or maybe a San Pedro ceremony in Peru, or a mushroom or Salvia ceremony in Mexico.<br /><br />Oh, what a gas it would be to be able to do a Wasson with Maria Sabina, God rest her soul.<br /><br />goblin

				Bro, I would avoid those nations tripping.<br /><br />The snakes, spiders and wasps!<br /><br />I prefer the good old English vacation, in a tent, with the mushrooms freshly picked and boiled and strained because there are things that live in the mushrooms. Never eat them raw.<br /><br />There is a kind of spiritual side to this drug use. Its not just about having a laugh around a campfire. Each year me and the guys go native, no chicks, just the guys and that break is a spiritual retreat of sort plus a bonding retreat as we live all over now and at least we know we got that time to ourselves. <br /><br />We climb trees, roam around with sticks, hunt for rabbits and hares. (to eat, not torment the poor thing)<br /><br />We live like cavemen, but with guitars, a home-made shower of a black bag filled with water (hope its sunny)<br /><br />If we trip, one of the guys always plays &#039;keeper of order&#039;. We agree that before tripping and if you go off into something a bit dark, the keeper of order is there to trust. The rest of the guys will gather round although we have had &#039;runners&#039;. guys who take shrooms or LSD (I prefer we all have shrooms) and we have to catch them before they injure themselves. Nearest cop is 25-30 miles away. Farmer knows that we might use shrooms and as long as we keep away from his personal land and property, he is cool.<br /><br />We have no ceremony, but we do tend to exercise well, eat well and choose a non raining night to trip.<br /><br />We have a big communal tent, but our own tents also. <br /><br />Always a campfire going and on the last night a big bonfire as long as the wind is not blowing a certain direction (cottages with straw roofs)<br /><br />In the communal tent, we do have religious things like a Jesus statue, Buddha, some Indian Gods and a Muslim prayer mat. One of the guys is Jewish but not a religious one. We put a flag of Israel for him. Not sure what the Jewish prophets look like. Guys with beards mainly. As are all the religions really. Apart from the women of course!<br /><br />But we are guys only so no white witch things or girly star signs. <br /><br />We do other holidays but kept up this tradition and I got to say I&#039;m excited now as we got a full turn out this year! <br /><br />We bring musical instruments also. That sometimes ends up what we do tripping. We break up into groups, some go wondering on their own but we wear a flourescebt sash on the sleeve or even jackets. That way we see each other like glowworms. Makes you feel unspooked if your in the woods and get into some bad moment. The campfire also acts like the safety net. Feel bad, head back to the warm fire and you always get the cool tripper. Guys just as one with all that is going on. The fire, calms you down, some primeval memory maybe of times when fire was safety and other people a must have to fend off natures tooth and claw.<br /><br />I&#039;d argue we are religious in a way and should be left as we cause no harm and always clean up so after we leave, you will see nothing apart from two burnt patches of grass which will come up greener than the other grass next year. You will see were the tents have been. That grows back in a week. You won&#039;t find any evidence of drugs. That is a big thing. And cans of beer also. We bin all the shit and never dump it in the surrounding countyside. A glass bottle can cause a fire but some of us live in the country and know the countryside code.<br /><br />We never see anyone there. The farmer comes with the lamb as we have a spit roast lamb one night. He gets a few pounds and we overpay as he is a decent old guy and appreciates that we keep the land clean always and have been going there for over 25 years now!<br /><br />So, if your English, don&#039;t forget we have some fantastic land, we have our mushrooms, we should all take a week out with buddies or even yourself. (some go back for a few nights on their own) Get in touch with nature. Go without a shower and shave for a few days. Same sex gathering are important for men, to bond and not have any trouble over who gets laid. Answer = nobody,, not even one of the guys who is gay. We don&#039;t go to a field in the middle of nowhere to chase chicks (or guys) we go for something thats hard to explain to &#039;normal&#039; folk. <br /><br />After that week we feel &#039;cleansed&#039;. It chills us out. The tripping is a big part of that for me but some years, I&#039;ve just hung out drinking beer and smoking the good bud and hash we all bring to the feast. We banned coke and speed. We accept MDMA as sitting around a campfire with buddies on MDMA is seriously good! <br /><br />Its the shrooms that do it for me.&nbsp; ;D Just being around that campfire, chatting shit or watching the flame fire show, its better than 50 weeks therapy with a shrink IMO.<br /><br />OK - we got a go in work to leave!<br /><br />Later.<br /><br />Gone!

				I wholly recommend going on an ayahuasca tour at least once. Yes there are dangers but that&#039;s what makes it so profound, its not an easy experience. Its an ordeal. Make sure you know who you are going with as there are fake shamans and scammers who will rape or rob you while you are under the influence. Take all necessary precautions when traveling abroad and get vaccinated for serious illnesses present in the country you are visiting. It is an eye opening experience tripping balls in the middle of the jungle with a real shaman trained in plant medicine. There is no escape, the nearest hospital is hours away and inaccessible and that is part of the experience, its all about being completely vulnerable and putting your life in the hands of the medicine, the shaman, and nature. Its about surrendering control. I strongly recommend a kambo experience too if you go!!!

				I know a group of people who go regularly. One of them is very prominent in the psychedelic sciences and you would all know who it is if I where to say the name. Unfortunately I cannot do so without potentially revealing who I am. Such is the nature of SR and annonymity.<br /><br />Oh I also highly recommend visiting the peyote way church in Arizona. They will take in white people, and basically leave you in the desert with a head full of peyote.

				I&#039;ve been there twice and it&#039;s been the best vacation ever, especially the second time. <br /><br />If you are into confort and niceties, there are many absolutely safe and comfy retreats, yet what you need to do is head over to the ayahuasca.com forums and start enquiring, so you can choose a shaman that appeals to you. <br /><br />Other than retreats, I&#039;ve made an expedition into the jungle, with these guys, who are amazing: http://www.extremeforestexpeditions.com/<br />If you go with these guys, you&#039;ll get to taste local mushrooms, nu-nu (amazonian hallucinogenic snuff), sapo (an extreme cleanser which contain opioids) and ayahuasca as well. Read the testimonials on their site. <br /><br />Feel free to ask anything here, I know the peruvian scene quite well.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Wow all the responses people have given you so far are absolutely brilliant, I have never thought about taking one of these trips but i have always wanted to travel to the amazon jungle, Just to explore some of the ancient ruins etc, I have always had exploring in my blood, I cant say which explorer im related to otherwise i would be as well just saying my name and address but there is something tha appeals t <br />o me about going somewhere where there are still uncharted places. I reckon if i was tripping there, and i didnt get killed by natives for walking around like a mad tripper, i would think im exploring ancient lands and all kinds of shit lol.
