				I tend to have what I call a very &quot;scientific&quot; veiw on the subject.<br /><br /><br />It should also be noted that don&#039;t believe in any sort of god or anything.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ve always thought that, when you die, nothing happens. Your brain ceases function, thus ceases to perceive anything ever again.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe we go anywhere, souls or what not, reincarnation, etc. I truly believe that when a person dies, that person is simply no more, that they will never experience anything ever again because, well, their brain is shut off permanently. They simply decompose and their decomposed matter goes on back to the Earth to fulfilled another duty; circle of life.<br /><br />It may seem a little depressing, but is it not more of a reason to get the most out of life while you&#039;re still thinking? Haha. I see it as more of a reason to live....while you can.

Intuition is giving me a feeling that we are eternal<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not iboga, but i have smoked dmt and tried VERY high (probably too high) doses of acid. Not so much shrooms, I tend to have a bad trip on them, regardless of how much i ingest...they also tear my stomach up.<br /><br />I&#039;m under the impression, that while psychedelics do have the ability to change a person&#039;s perception, some personality traits of a person is more or less just who they are.<br /><br />I&#039;m not gonna lie, I had whole worlds opened up to me thanks to those drugs. I was able to see things that I wasn&#039;t able to see before. I believe that once you try one of those drugs, your perception of life really does change forever.<br /><br />That being said, everyone also handles those drugs differently, and, due to the fact that it&#039;s simply the way I am and probably always will be, I tend to just always be overly analytical and hold&nbsp; beliefs more grounded in what can be proven by science. <br /><br />For example, a person that&#039;s somewhat spiritual pre first trip, is more likely to be more of a spiritual person after they experience a trip.<br /><br />It also means that person that thinks the way I do, is more likely to continue to think that way afterwards. the only difference between pre-trip and post trip is that a person like me is more open to other people&#039;s veiws and or thinks of ideas, ideas still suited to that person&#039;s pretrip mentality, that he or she would have never thought of before tripping.<br /><br />To be more clear on what a person like me is like post trip is, I became more philosophical. I didn&#039;t suddenly have new spiritual type ideas, though, because that simply is not how my brain works. I just simply became more aware of the different ways of thinking....a lot like any other person tripping would do, except that I treated my new ideas like a researcher would treat any discovery in the science field.<br /><br />Before I ever tripped, I would have never said this:<br /><br />to each his own.<br /><br />I truly believe in that more than anything.<br />

				I would like to share my first acid trip. The set: I basically found everything about life depressing, like why do people ever celebrate or go through sober daily life at all, theres no meaning were just creatures doing boring things day in and day out. I had heard about lsd giving profound, possibly spiritual experiences so I bought a 10-strip, ate part of it, decided it was either plain paper or just really weak so I just ate it all. <br /><br />Intricate fractals formed eyes that morphed out of everything: the trees had eyes, the sky did, man everything was looking at me. I felt like they were light-beings, or the collective unconscious, or a bunch of beings that were also one being. The being projected love at me and gave me a strong feeling that we will all exist as one.<br /><br />Anyway, thats the explanation for why I believe in souls.

Nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Although, like I said my post before, to each his own.

				When I was 16 I shared a flat with a friend who was 17. We took a large dose of mushrooms one night (1st time) and were having a great time till about 4am when I stupidly said &quot;What if we died and we just think we&#039;re here but we&#039;re actually lying dead somewhere else.&quot; I fuckin freaked myself out and my friend, we had to go up to another friends and chap her out of bed at 5am to check we were really here. I&#039;ve never went near mushrooms since!<br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m terrified of dying :( lol
