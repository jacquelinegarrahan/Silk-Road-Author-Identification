				Obviously it can depend on your location and the demand for that certain product, but overall - what is the most profitable product to resell. (Purchased from SR - Sold locally)<br /><br />So far I have found-<br />Weed -&nbsp; good quality / shitty profit<br />Shrooms - good quality / almost double in my area<br />Nbome - / excellent profit, but not too much demand<br />MDMA - great quality / meh profit<br />---------------------------------------<br />Please do add to the list or fix mine :)<br /><br />EDIT: Also, I&#039;d like to consider risk factors in receiving the product.

				I can&#039;t see how you can make money buying off the SR. Only way i can see is buying the top notch coke and h and cutting it up heavily. Still wouldn&#039;t make same profits as If you had your own supply.

				I think the coke and heroin markets can be very profitable if you supply to a certain market niche; rich people that want a very high quality product and are willing to pay a premium for it. Fishscale cocaine and extremely high quality heroin are in very low supply at a consumer level, and if you can locate the demand there is definitely a lot of profit to be had. <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say MDMA&#039;s profitability isn&#039;t impressive either, it&#039;s one of the few items that is reasonably priced. Vendors also offer it in bulk unlike most other products.

				Buy Galindoi&#039;s shrooms. He sells at about $50 an oz. Sell at $30 an 1/8th and you make almost $200 profit (like a 500% turn over). Not to mention people love you for the quality and inexpensive product.

				The MDMA market here is saturated with shitty product; it wouldn&#039;t be hard to buy some here, cut it, and then sell $100 grams.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve been doing pretty well flipping some of the pills from NL, the only issue is that I&#039;ve had way too many packages seized. <br />It would be damn near impossible to make a profit buying weed here; it kills me to see venders charge 1.5x-2x on ounces versus what I could get them for locally. <br />I (luckily) don&#039;t know anything about the local h or coke market.

				Weed you can easily grow yourself with a bit of investment. Can buy self contained growing cabinets that use very little power, no smell, or just make your own setup cheaper. I think these boxes are $3k-6k each http://www.bcnorthernlights.com/<br /><br />Sell the bud, then make hash out of the leftovers from harvesting<br />Sell $220/oz here domestic mail order and probably make back your money in a day.<br /><br />Surprised more American&#039;s aren&#039;t buying up defaulted homes for next to nothing and turning them into massive grow operations like we do here :) http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/3268.html<br /><br />Hell, you could even run a GLBSE bitcoin listing to get investors to help you buy the house ;)<br />

				lol you guys have it rough for reselling. I could literally make hella profit reselling almost anything off sr, and I&#039;m just in a shitty drug market part of the states.<br /><br />My favorite profit margin products:<br />MDMA - 300-500+% (low safety risk, easily received in an envelope)<br />fungi - ~300%

				Rc&#039;s kill around here. Bare minimum 300% profit margin for 2c-1. For people I don&#039;t know so well up to 500%. So easy, just wish there was a consistent supplier of 1-5 grams that was reliable.

				Growing shrooms has pretty large margins.<br />Ketamine probably has the most potential for profit but you will need to shift a lot of it.

				First, you have to find out street prices for everything in your area. <br /><br />(I wish there was a street price sticky for all indulgences here on SR. I hope DPR is reading this.)<br />Next, it all depends on what the demand and supply is in you area.<br /><br />Used to patronize a f2f vendor for the nose candy for 2 years, about 6 months ago. SR&#039;s prices don&#039;t come NEAR to what the connect had. It wasn&#039;t fish scale, but one level under. I put a handful of cats out of business.<br /><br />However, many customers were asking for pills. So immersed in the game, did not do any homework on them until the connect decided he had enough of the game.<br /><br />Ironically, that is when SR came into the picture. Green, which I would NEVER sell, probably has the best ability to move in volume, in my area from SR to IRL.<br /><br />Ketamine probably is the best mover, when it comes to customer retention from SR to IRL. Just can&#039;t do it to people, though.<br /><br />Pills is the best margin translator from SR to IRL, in my opinion. <br /><br />Molly is probably next. Just don&#039;t want to frequent raves.

				Yh I know I bought 5g of Baroso&#039;s weed when I first joined for roughly £30, gave half to a friend for £20 and smoked the rest myself. Probably equal to anything I&#039;ve smoked in the U.K for half the price. Makes you wonder...

				The dutch molly here is the best there is. I think in most places (except NL ofcourse :) you can sell it for a healthy markup most def even though if there are pills around, i think you&#039;ll soon have a small but LOYAL customer base and i think that&#039;s better than quantity alone.

				MDMA all the way.<br /><br />You can get 100 Pinks tars for 500 and have no problem selling them for 15+.<br /><br />Ir 5g for 150 of crystal and easily clear 100 a gram+.<br /><br />Mushrooms suck to sell, people don&#039;t trip all the time and buy bags and sit on them. Then you have the guy who thinks its necessary to eat 7 grams his first time and end ups going fucking nuts or worse the group that splits an oz and go bat shit. <br /><br />Nothing like getting a call at 3 in the morning screaming that their what is this stuff.

				Since I have zero interest in doing this myself, I&#039;ll let you in on something: study drugs<br /><br />Ritalin and Adderall are easily bought quite cheaply online (maybe not on SR based on the prices I&#039;ve seen, haha) and then sold for a killing IRL.

However, one might need to purchase a pill press, and that can be expensive.<br /><br />Obviously, one has to buy in bulk on here to be able to turn profit. <br /><br />I am very suprised there isn&#039;t a vendor on here from somewhere in Florida, where you can usually find 30 mg Oxycodone on the street for under $15, and I&#039;ve had friends make the trip to Florida and return with hundreds of 30&#039;s that they paid a whopping $12 each for.<br /><br />All the pharma opioid on here are priced more or approximately the same as the street price here, and I have never seen any truley bulk offers in the marketplace, maybe a 10 pack.<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is this....<br /><br />My goal is to buy enough drugs on SR to supply me and my closes friends, and charge them enough to make my stuff a bit cheaper. <br /><br />But there are a lot of things on SR that I would have no way to sale, so I haven&#039;t even looked at, RC&#039;s for instance. <br /><br />Like has been said, ordering the high end coke or H and selling it to high end recreational users is the only way I see that I could turn any proffit here.<br /><br />If one was looking at this as a business, the volume and margins would both be low. Having one order intercepted could rob you of your profit from the past several orders.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The new laws fucked up doctor shopping and over prescribing and the price has +++++++. You used to be able to get bottles for 700 now its the typical madness.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I use to get 240 roxi 30s per month for $1 each...not the case today<br />to think those scripts are worth $7000 here on SR makes me sick<br /><br />I&#039;ts cheaper now in South Florida to purchase 10 dime bags for $80<br />rather than deal with Roxis for $30-$35 or Dillies for $50 each
