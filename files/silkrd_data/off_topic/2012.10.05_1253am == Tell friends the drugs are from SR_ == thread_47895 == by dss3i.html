				In the near future I will likely have some pills to pop with my friends, and they will undoubtedly at some point ask me where I get the pills. I would describe my friends as less careful/paranoid than myself, and as a result a few of them have gotten in trouble with the police (nothing major). I trust my friends, but I know that they talk a lot and I&#039;m afraid that some little kid sitting in the corner at a party, watching everyone else have fun, will overhear my chitchatty friends and tell his/her cop dad that a girl in his/her class is buying online drugs. I don&#039;t live in an area with much crime and just maybe this dad cop will decide to bust this teenage kid who is buying drugs online (not that I am planning to use my own mailbox, but I imagine it would be easier for the cops to bust me/they would have greater desire to do so, if they know I get the drugs online, than if I got them from some dealer). So, say I&#039;m offering my closest 5-10 friends to buy some drugs from me (I&#039;m not planning on making money dealing and I will sell for the same price that I buy, as they have sold to me in the past), and they ask me where they come from, is it reasonably okay for me to tell them or would you experienced SR buyers recommend that I tell a lie? I far prefer being honest, but I don&#039;t want to scratch my skin.

				There is literally not one pro vs the cons in telling them you get your drugs from SR. Just tell them they are from a &quot;friend&quot;, that&#039;s all they need to know. I&#039;m sure you realize the dangers in giving away too much info so I will save you the lecture.

				This is a tough one. I personally would try to avoid saying the drugs are from SR. Just do as NOTspacecase said and say they are from a friend who would rather remain anonymous. I know you will probably get the urge while your really fucked up with them to tell them because they will probably think you are some type of god, but try and hold it back. I know I get that urge sometimes, and I think it&#039;s best to just forget about it because only bad things could come from it. (no longer friends with someone, he rats, etc).<br /><br />@NOTspacecase<br />What&#039;s up with the name man? I have a spacecase and I like it, but it was rather expensive. I hear they are a rip-off, though, but it seems to be high quality.

				You are right. I will tell them that my dealer prefers to remain anonymous. I&#039;m glad I thought this through before I&#039;m at that party, because otherwise I might have given in and told them how I really get the drugs. It is a shame, because I know a few of them would enjoy hearing about it (they love technology), but it&#039;s for the best.

				@NOTspacecase ahh alright. Glad to see you&#039;re not getting banned anymore, lol.<br /><br />Yeah I suppose it&#039;s for the best. I have told a close friend about SR. He basically fell in love but I didn&#039;t understand exactly how BTC worked at the time. I don&#039;t think I am going to tell him that I have figured it out and already made my first purchase. I feel if they are intrigued enough they will find it in time like you and I have. Or if they ask you about it I&#039;m sure it would be alright to give them a few tips.

				I told my best friend who has never done drugs, has no desire to ever do so, and dislikes the fact that I do drugs. I will also tell my boyfriend when time is due. And that&#039;s it, because those are the only two people I can trust 100% and who I know are smart enough to not bring me trouble (unintentionally).

				Yeah this is an easy one for me, as most my friends are too computarded to even understand the concept of TOR, nevermind getting here.<br /><br />The few close mates who I trust also happen to be good with comps I let em know about it, but most are just so used to using me for convenience I don&#039;t think they&#039;ve come to check it out.

				abolsutely no good can come from telling the truth in this circumstance.. but i dont believe in lying either, so really IMO just say &quot;i got them from someone that i dont know&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thats honest and doesnt expose your links.&nbsp; The SR relationship is a relationship that needs to be kept in shape by the span of your intelligence.&nbsp; What do you gain from mentioning SR? NOTHING.<br /><br />Now, lets say that someone approaches you, someone more serious, someone more on the drug scene etc, and they for example want to purchase a bunch, then in that case...........ITS STILL NOT WORTH IT lol.. just collect the cash and tell them two wait two weeks while you place the order and wait for the &quot;guy&quot; to deliver it to you before your client can get it.&nbsp; Literally makes noooo sense to mention that you are involved.

				Dont know if this was already said BUT you should add a premium to the price as you will&nbsp; be the one paying for it if a package gets lost !!<br /><br />Insure urself or you will have to make up&nbsp; a story like you have been ripped off in an dark alley ..u will either look weak , a fool or a liar as some might suspect u just ripping them.<br /><br />Stay careful.<br /><br />Better dont say anything at all.

That&#039;s a problem, because I don&#039;t want to take a premium. In the past when my friends sold to me they told me the exact method of obtaining the drug and I agreed to the risk and would pay if it didn&#039;t work out. I would like to do the same for them now, but safety first so I might need to take a small premium. I am really not planning on selling much at all, though, and not yet, not until I&#039;ve gained some experience just buying for myself and my boyfriend.

In fact I will be a very small buyer. My boyfriend will be very chill with me selling drugs. He has sold in the past. The reason he doesn&#039;t know I&#039;m on SR is that I&#039;m going to surprise him with drugs on his birthday&nbsp; ;D
