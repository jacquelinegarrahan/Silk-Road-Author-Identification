				So you&#039;re wanting to become a vendor on SR?<br />Make sure you have a reliable supplier of quality product. Pay for a vendor account($150), then post on the Product Offers section of the forum. This will help you determine if you have a good demand for your product, usually this isn&#039;t a problem with MDMA. <br /><br />Just because you&#039;ve bought a lot of drugs, doesn&#039;t mean you also have what it takes to sell. As long as you&#039;re selling quality product at a reasonable price, with an excellent shipping method, you should be fine. <br /><br />sdesu

				Ok if you are you need to ask yourself the following questions -<br /><br />Have you sold IRL?<br /><br />If yes are you willing to work harder than you would IRL?<br /><br />Are you the sort of person that is open to criticism and do you learn from it?<br /><br />Are you willing to learn from other sellers on SR?<br /><br />Are you the sort of person that does market research?<br /><br />Do you have a basic idea of how to wash BTC on a basic level?<br /><br />Are you customer orientated?<br /><br />Are you good at communicating with people? <br /><br />If yes to all of those, give it a go. If not, then you either need to learn that shit first or if you don&#039;t want to learn it, don&#039;t bother because you need them all to make it work on here. <br /><br />Whatever you decide, God speed. :)
