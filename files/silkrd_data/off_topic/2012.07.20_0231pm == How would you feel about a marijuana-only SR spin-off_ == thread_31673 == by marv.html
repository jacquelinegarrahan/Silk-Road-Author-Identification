				Like The Armory, but for weed.<br /><br />I have nothing against drugs other than marijuana nor the people that use them, but at this point in my life I&#039;ve settled down to good old pot. <br /><br />I know that I would have more peace of mind if I were using a site that deals with pot exclusively, and it would probably not attract so much negative attention. <br /><br />Just like the weapons gave SR a bad taste and led to a separate site, I feel that &#039;hard&#039; drugs give the pot a bad taste.<br /><br />Again, nothing against any drug or any user, I&#039;m not preaching or riding a high horse, but it&#039;s just some idea that I wonder how other SR users would feel about.

				I hear ya, Raoul, and whether or not it would be worth it, I do not know. I certainly don&#039;t know enough about the coding and whatever other aspects come into play in such an endeavor.<br /><br />At the same time, I disagree that a drug is a drug is a drug. Marijuana is looked at differently than other drugs, like prescription pills for example. Weed is looked at differently by not only the general public but also law enforcement. While it&#039;s true they would just as gladly bust you for pot as any other drug, a bust for, say, Adderall without a prescription leaves a much harsher taste in the mouth than does a bust for a few grams of pot. I think the difference in sentiment is palpable.

				I think that the DEA consists of robots which have been programmed to identify illegal drugs but which have not had algorithms for differentiating between drugs added to their circuitry <br /><br />

				yeah the penalties are different, and yes it is only complete muppets that lump pot in the same class as heroin, or even alcohol, but at the end of the day they are all illegal. <br /><br />why would you want a pot only site? so you don&#039;t have to look at other drugs or because if you got caught on it you wouldn&#039;t get in as much trouble? cannabis has it&#039;s own section so apart from the home page you don&#039;t have to look at the other drugs, and as far as the not as much trouble is concerned you&#039;re also &quot;contributing to an ongoing criminal enterprise&quot; which would drop you more in the shit than simple possession of a couple of grams of pot

				I think it is a good idea and I bet that someone out there is already thinking about it.&nbsp; If you look at the drug listings on SR I think you&#039;ll find that the most listings are for pot.&nbsp; I think site that focused on medical grade buds, hash and edibles would be popular.&nbsp; There are tons of people out there like me - boring professionals - who live in an ass backwards state and just want a safe and honest supply of cannabis.&nbsp; I would feel less paranoid buying from such a site because in my mind it would be under less scrutiny.&nbsp; That being said - the SR is a GOD SEND and I won&#039;t be leaving anytime soon.

				Yeah, agree with Raul, drugs is drugs. Meth is a scary drug to me and seeing what its done to some individuals and communities in the USA I&#039;m glad its not big here in the UK. I&#039;d never touch it myself but I believe its all about personal choice, which is what government deny us. The Silk Road supplies us with this personal choice. I&#039;ve got no problem with Meth being on here or heroin or whatever, or the people who choose to use those drugs. I believe every drug should be legal and until/if that time ever arrives I think the Silk Road need only be the place to come. Just because harder drugs are available here I don&#039;t think it has any negative impact on weed only peeps. To most of us; our authoritarian governments attitude is &#039;Drugs are bad, m&#039;kay&#039; and that seems to be as deep as they are willing to think.
