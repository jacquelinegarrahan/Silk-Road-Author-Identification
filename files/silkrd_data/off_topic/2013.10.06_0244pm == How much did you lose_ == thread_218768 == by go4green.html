				Hi,<br /><br />Just a little survey to see what people have lost with SR closed down. <br /><br />For me, I had 0.003 Bitcoins. I never keep coins in my account. I only get some coins transferred when I want to buy something. And I only transfer what is enough to make a purchase + shipping. Maybe that is what we should do when we move. <br /><br />I&#039;m only sad that I will have to re-establish myself as a buyer. I was a member for a year with + 50 successful transactions. <br /><br />What were your stats like?

				Had about 2k sitting in escrow.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t sound like much to some people, but it was damn near all I had.&nbsp; Vendor account for 1.5 years with 100% rating and a buyer&#039;s account with 50+ purchases, about 60k spent&nbsp; :-\

				I already posted this question in poll form here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=217606.new#new<br /><br />According to the results, the majority of us (almost 40%) lost between $1 - $100. I personally had about $30 BTC in my account and over $100 in escrow, but I&#039;m not counting that as a loss until I determine whether or not my orders will ever arrive. I believe some of them will as they were marked in transit Monday or Tuesday before the shut down.

				I lost 3.5 BTCs. Thankfully, I never buy BTCs unless I&#039;m ready to consider that money gone. Unfortunately, I had no intention of spending those coins in the short term, so I could have kept them in my own wallet instead of here on SR. It was my fault I lost them.

				gn0ssos<br />Sorry, didn&#039;t see the previous post.<br />250k and 90k? Wow!<br /><br />Even 3-5k is a lot for a new vendor! My condolences to those lost their money.<br />But remember, what doesn&#039;t kill you makes you stronger! Focus on your next move.. It is NOT the end :)
