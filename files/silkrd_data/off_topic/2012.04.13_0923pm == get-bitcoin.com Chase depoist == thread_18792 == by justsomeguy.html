				I&#039;ve worked with get-bitcoin.com before for smaller amounts (&lt;$300), and they&#039;ve always come through for me.&nbsp; With the 420 sale coming up, I&#039;m planning on doing like a $700 deposit with Chase bank.&nbsp; Should I split that up into two $350 transactions, or will one $700 transaction be fine?&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to show my ID at Chase if it is below $1000, right?&nbsp; (Or is it only $500?)

				Yeah, I&#039;m more concerned about the ID part.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure Chase doesn&#039;t require ID until it&#039;s above $1000, but I was looking for confirmation on that.

				i would either do two separate transactions or just the big one.&nbsp; The worst thing that could happen is a young bank employee asks for your ID and you say you didn&#039;t bring it.&nbsp; I have found that when i go to chase i deal with a young hot banker who is more focused on me talking about how her weekend is than what I am actually doing.&nbsp;

				I recommend staying away from get-bitcoin in general. The two times I&#039;ve dealt with them they came through but went past their 24 hour window, and charged me the service fee anyway. There have been an alarming number of people saying they haven&#039;t received their coins from them/they have taken days to fill their order. They appear to be a selective scam. There are plenty of other exchanges to go through, I recommend bitinstant. The coins are usually in your wallet by the time you get home from the bank.

				Yea over 1000 you have to show id- but Ive done orders of like 950 and had no issue.&nbsp; The last time I used them however I had almost 2000 locked up with them over a couple days and they wouldnt release the coins or return emails for like 2 days and when they did they asked me to resend shit and said i never sent them shit- then it took another day and a half to get them- now this wasn&#039;t all my money it was part some associates- I almost shat myself, but eventually they came through and still charged me a fee which was pretty lame but i was more than happy to have my money back- I like them because ive always recieved from them, but that last transaction sketched me out a little bit- Id say your fine doing the 700, but just relieze you may have to be persistant if they dont respond.

				Just an update: I just put through an order (just one deposit) for &gt;$700, and it went great.&nbsp; About 20 hours from emailing my receipt, I had the coins in my wallet.<br /><br />As for all the mistrust, I have heard of them sometimes not refunding fees for taking over 24 hours (which is lame), but have seen only a couple complaints of actually never getting any coins.&nbsp; So far I&#039;ve had good experiences, they&#039;ve changed a few k for me in a timely manner.&nbsp; However, I understand how it feels sketchy to people.&nbsp; I mean, this process is definitely risky, and requires trusting some random company employees you&#039;ve never met.&nbsp; Definitely nerve-wracking waiting for those coins to come through!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18792.msg196804#msg196804">Quote from: bsalt on April 19, 2012, 05:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t trust get bitcoin they asked for pics of my ID my first and only time dealing with them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They only require ID for orders &gt;$1000, or if you want to use your own bank account.&nbsp; You can easily split up your orders, and using your own account is already somewhat compromising.&nbsp; They talk about this on their FAQ, and after reading it I don&#039;t know why anyone from SR would want to disclose so much info:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: GetBitcoin FAQ</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Unfortunately, we have lost thousands of dollars on these [bank account] orders, due to our banks clearing payments that were later fraudulently reversed.
