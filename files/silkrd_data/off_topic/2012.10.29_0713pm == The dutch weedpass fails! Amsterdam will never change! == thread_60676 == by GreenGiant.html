				Fresh from the dutch press ........<br /><br />The wietpas expires, but access to coffeeshops remains reserved<br />residents of identity or residence permit, together with an extract<br />from the population can tones. The maintenance of this residence criterion<br />done in consultation with municipalities and necessary phases, which is<br />connected to the local coffee shop and security so that there is<br />local customization.

				from a dutch source working in the coffeshops - it will be down to local authorities to decide and cities like Amsterdam &amp; Harlem certainly have no intention and never had any intentions of banning tourists, the southern towns in Holland may decide to keep tourists band though.

				We&#039;ve got to remember about all the international pressure that&nbsp; NL receives. the countries that it borders both export + import Weed (and other drugs) to NL. having local authorities deciding the terms of the wiedpass is not a bad idea, <br /><br />im sure it will relieve some pressure from the international community on the border towns + allow the Netherlands to continue with its business.

				The rest of the developed world is shuffling slowly towards liberalisation of cannabis. Once there are more destinations for cannabis tourists, Amsterdam will lose both the advantages and disadvantages of its unique position.
