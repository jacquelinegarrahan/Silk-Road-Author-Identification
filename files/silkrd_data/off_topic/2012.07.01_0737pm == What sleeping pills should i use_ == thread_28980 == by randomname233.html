				Hi, My life sucks. So i decided to take suicide. This is not my first try. I tried 2 times before and they were very close. But i survived :(<br />Now to my question, Im going to try again. But i want to have some sleeping pills so i don&#039;t wake up. (IM NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELF WITH THE PILLS!) I just use them so i don&#039;t wake up when my body is getting killed.<br />So which pills should i buy? I want to buy them from silkroad. And I live in europe.<br /><br />P.S Please don&#039;t bitch about that i should go and talk with someone. Im going on antidepressant and they are not working on me. And im talking to someone but it&#039;s not helping. So please help me and say which pills i should use :3 thanks!

				Anti-depressants aren&#039;t the answer. Try mdma, methylone, 4-aco-dmt, 4g of shrooms, smoked dmt, or any strong hallucinogen for insight.<br /><br />Since I got that out of the way and you&#039;re ready to die:<br />Order some GHB and put yourself into a coma. Good luck with the death I guess. Don&#039;t make it messy, people have to clean up after you.

				Yeah man, try some MDMA. You seem like you&#039;ve got nothing to lose. Get some friends over and maybe a man/lady and try to have a good time. Nobody here is going to give you information on how to become comatose while you commit suicide, regardless of how deranged and criminally insane we all likely are.

				GHB? XTC<br /><br />What a answers!! Bullocks!!!<br /><br />So your life is no fun...? Didn&#039;t laugh for several years and crying yourself to sleep every night for over a few years now? And you don&#039;t want to talk to someone? I have a number for you. Not a doctor or a paid professional. Just someone with live experience. So as I am hearing you, did you have all the list of profi&#039;s already had, and nothing seems to work.<br /><br />I do not know you, so I will not be in morning, when you are death. And maybe nobody will be sad to see you gone, but I am taking you serious. Doesn&#039;t matter to me.. But GHB is not the right choice!<br />Want to know what is? I will tell you after you have called the number I mentioned. I didn&#039;t gave the number yet, because it is not his work to keep people from taking their own lives.<br />Killing yourself is not a crime. but do it good, so the community and health-insurance don&#039;t lose one single penny from your action. It is your live so do as you please with it.<br /><br />GHB is just a drug&nbsp; you will not wake up if the train is hitting you. Take it 10 minutes before the train comes. After 30 minutes you will be awake again. Put a nice song on your earphones, from your ipod or mp3. Before the song is over you will be out of this world and if the train does it&#039;s job properly, you should be gone.&nbsp; No legs and no hands to pull just a bullet in your brain, could be the result.<br />&nbsp;Put your right hand out of your sleef of your coat and put your hand in your trouser and tighten your belt. You will lose most likely all limbs, so Hope that the hand in your pens survives so you can always squeeze a trigger. Unzip your zipper when you want t pea is not that important, because you will not be able to go to the toilet anyway.<br />Think of the the machinist and what you are doing to him.<br /><br />GHB is quickly dissolved by your body.<br />&nbsp;After 30 minutes you can&#039;t tell if you you had some ghb or not.<br />Not my way to go.<br /><br />I should only use it to end the life of a loved one, so he or she is not aware of the deadly dose of the morphine. Or Di-actylmorphine that I will give analy. Swallowing will urge the body to vomit.<br />It works like this;<br />First will the outer-layer of your brain be effected.<br />I am Dutch, we call it the &quot;&quot;hersenschors&quot;&quot;, as the dope does his work it will eventually reach the &quot;&quot; hersenstam&quot;&quot;. There are the funcr tioncontrols of your breathing and to make your hart tik. You have had most likely already had some kind of pill from your doctor to put up your ars. That is because of the bloodvessels that are their to obtain whatever is in the pill or whatever. At the end of your spine, where your brain starts is the place that are most needy for your vital functions. The heroin will stop those basic functions so your hart will stop beating and your lungs will stop to breath. Much better then cyaancali where you start to breath heavely, but because of the effect of the cyaancali (the oxygen will not be able to be obtained by your blood) Basically a scary death.<br /><br />&nbsp;Who wants to go, will find a way. Don&#039;t jump of buildings. Even not in a big bag with your credentials for easy recognition <br /><br />A amount of 7 or 8 ml is usually enough to pass someone out.<br />&nbsp;Take 1 mill for every 10kg of your body weight.<br /><br />If you want to euthanize yourself, you should take a overdose of a morphine derivative like heroin. Bring it in anally. 1 gr heroin for every 10 kg of your body. So if you are 70 kg you should bring 7 gr of heroin in your ass. You will go to sleep to never wake up again.<br /><br />GHB is not the suicide substance that I should advise.<br />You will vomit before you pass-out, and throw up your GHB.<br /><br />GHB is made caustic soda and gbl.<br /><br />Google caustic soda and make sure that it is worked out, Otherwise it will burn through your throat, burning through your skin from the inside out. But adding water will speed up the proces so if the hole is big enough there should come so much blood so that you will drown in your own blood. Not right away, after you are to tired to cough your blood up. Not a nice way to go.<br /><br />But for the fact that I am writing this for the cunt of the cat, you will have to let me know that you are reading what I am writing. Because the cunt of the cat can not read, so why writing then?<br /><br />If you are serious, I can help to find a save nice way out for you.<br /><br />GHB ??? Just as stupid as take 100 valiums.<br />&nbsp;Why not take the caustic soda and swallow it dry?<br />One small bottle will kill you for sure.<br /><br /><br />Can not find something that the topic-starter is just joking.<br />If you can not give a proper advise, leave it to others.<br /><br />GHB...lol or rather col, where the c stands for crying.<br />Get serious!<br /><br />Randomname 233 give me a pm, if you are not joking.<br />QWe will see from there what the next step will be...!<br /><br /><br />Greetings, Wasta<br /><br /><br />

				Ye i could try mdma. But thats not going to help. I will feel happy for a cupple of hours. But my problem will still be left. I have been feeling like this for the past 5 years. And the first time i tried to take my life I had to go to the hospital and they had a hard time to fix me. I was near death.<br />The second time i tried to hang myself. Everything went black and i woke up and my belt had gone off :/<br /><br />So this time i want to hang myself again. But with a better rope. And use something so i pass out. Btw the first time i didn&#039;t use anything to pass out.<br /><br />Ye i could just start walking. But i don&#039;t have the money to do it. And i don&#039;t want to beg for my food.<br /><br />Hmm so i weight something about 70kg. So i should buy 8gram heroin and take it and I&#039;ll die?? That sounds really easy :) Will i feel any pain or anything like that? Or will i just pass out and die? Thanks in advance! :D and if i survive i will properly go to hospital and then right back to mental hospital.<br /><br />And wasta why would i joke about this? And if you guys still not believe me i can tell some more about how i tried to take my life the first time.<br /><br />I&#039;ll go to sleep now. Summer job in 6 hours :/ But that will give me some money so i can take my life.

				I told you how to leave this live.<br /><br />I told you that GHB or XTC will not kill you. My advice, Just going to sleep and never wake up again.<br />Would want to show you how...<br />But you are not serious. Take a rope and hang yourself. Measure the length of the bridge and take a rope that is 30 feet shorter. Tie one and on the bridge and tie the other and to your head. But you can not even jump of 15 level high building, or stand in front of a train. Blindfold yourself and put the music on 10 and face the other way.<br />But for sure, your third attemp will not succeed either. Not serious enough to give give solid advice.<br /><br />Read my post again... is that all you have to say?<br />Hope you die soon, so I do not have to read one another baloney word from you again.<br />Could say I hope you die, but you know as I do, that you to stupid to make that to a success.<br /><br />I hope your wishes come true, the sooner the better.<br />But no nice way to go from me, that you just blew away.<br /><br />Happy endings!

He asked what drug would keep him asleep while he dies. That&#039;s why I said to induce a ghb coma. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t ask how he was dying but I figured he had that part figured out and just needed to stay asleep a little bit longer or deeper. The body and brain fight vigorously to stay alive, if you&#039;ve tried to die by things like hanging/suffocation/carbon monoxide, you&#039;ll know what I mean. I figured he was getting almost there and waking up in a hospital because he fought off whatever it was. I assumed it was carbon monoxide since that seems to be a pretty common thing people can crawl out of and not really recall much but puking.<br /><br />Mdma was mentioned as a substitute because it&#039;s favorable for most of us, especially compared to death. But, not everyone has the same desire to live. It is just for some of us, it has changed our lives so dramatically, we suggested that to live, not to die. Nobody in here said he would die by ghb or mdma, but you&#039;d know that if your reading comprehension wasn&#039;t destroyed by your desire to preach.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t matter if you wish him dead, or don&#039;t believe him or if he&#039;s trolling silkroaders, you&#039;re not obligated to respond. You sound like a whiny cunt because this kid won&#039;t kill himself the way you want him to. Then, you tell him to read your post but you won&#039;t read his posts. You have disregarded almost everything he has said just to say what you had to say and got yourself pissed off, while doing it.<br /><br />He&#039;s not going to step in front of a train. I hope he doesn&#039;t do a bridge trick. Keep in mind, you want to minimize the trauma. Your family and friends are already going to be ruined, no need to do a bridge or tree hang and have some more people traumatized.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Summer job&quot; might indicate this person is under 18, and as such, I hope you find help even more. If you haven&#039;t thought it out for at least a decade, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re ready. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want you to kill yourself but damn, this is some real life stuff whether or not it&#039;s true in this case, plenty have been there, easy to be holier than thou in retrospect. He may not get that retrospect.<br /><br />Please spare people the problems with train/tree/extra victims/mess.<br /><br />PS: One time I was pretty sure I wanted to kill myself so I spent 3-4 hours looking at pictures of the aftermath from suicide. The prettiest one was a heroin OD but that doesn&#039;t mean all OD&#039;s are pretty. Like Chris Farley&nbsp; :o

If I&#039;m going to take suicide I should be prepared. whetheryou believe me or not. <br /><br />if you&nbsp; really really don&#039;t&nbsp; believe me I can make a suicide video when I take eg heroin.<br /><br /><br />What does it matter how old I&#039;m??? My family already found out that I&#039;m suicidal and I don&#039;t want to go back to the mental hospital.<br />It was in the mental hospital I tries to hang myself.

I pointed out the possibility to the other poster because whether or not I believe you is irrelevant and if we all knew you were 100% serious, you would get different responses. I assumed you were serious but there&#039;s a possibility you&#039;re not. It&#039;s not my business to make that call.

I can give you my reason but I don&#039;t think you care to hear it and it &#039;doesn&#039;t matter&#039; so my reason is again, irrelevant.<br /><br />Stop going to the mental hospital. The worst things I did for my depression when I was a teenager were:<br />1) start meds.<br />2) fall in love.<br /><br />The best things I did:<br />1) Stopped taking all drugs (minus nicotine) for several years.<br />2) Finally got out of love.<br /><br />It&#039;s easy to look back on yourself and say &quot;oh, I was being a pussy&quot; and to some degree I was, but I can also remember how REAL those feelings were. The feeling of wanting to die was very, very real and all I can say is it actually does get better. <br /><br />If you&#039;re going to die anyway, why not wait 4-5 years, if SR still exists, I&#039;ll buy you some Heroin. ;)<br /><br />I know how cliche some of the shit sounds man, but when the end comes, that&#039;s the end... I dunno, it&#039;s just one of those things. There is no ctrl+z with successful suicide. I know it seems like that&#039;s what you want right now.<br /><br />

				Well it&#039;s not like i want to, My parents forced me to go to the mental hospital. And it was crazy that i got out? Don&#039;t know why. But anyways i have stopped eating my meds for a week or so. They are not helping at all.<br />Im 17 years old now and i wanted to die since i was 12-14 or something. I Tried the first time when i was 15 year old, But it was not serious. <br /><br />I have decided. I&#039;m going to wait until i get my summer job money and buy 50gram GHB and spend the rest of the money on heroin. Got 1k $. <br /><br />I&#039;ll go to the forest and eat everything. I will also eat some other pills that are not recommended to take when taking GHB. And the put a rope around my neck and hang myself. <br /><br />You are not going to be able to change my mind. A professional psychologist failed so if your not and psychologist or not very pro at this then i don&#039;t think you will be able to change my mind.<br /><br />

The combination of barbiturates and alcohol wil shut your brain down, until it has reached the place of your brain directly above your spine. Al last vital mechanisms like breathing and the beating of your hart are controlled there. Barbiturates you can find here. But you are not even a adult. It is not a not normal thing wanting to die. Thousands ands thousands succeed every year. Often young people. Live aint easy. Move to a other city, take a different job. Be Elvis! Be someone else. But I am not the one you should take to. PM me your cellphone number. I will explain the easiest way out with those barbiturates and you will give me your phone number. You will be called bij a person who wants to hear your story. He will trie to talk you out of it. But you will now how to die painlessly. You really are just going to sleep, and will never wake up again. Clean first all you can clean throw away as much as possible so the ones after you will have as little work as possible. Goggle suicide and barbiturates and pm me back. Your 17 years. Your pain is not going to stay unbaerable for five more years. When you are 23 you can be a father. And you will have a son that has a mouth to feed, and will look up to you how you do your damn duty to work. You will be tired, you will sweat and bleed. Your parents will die, and lot&#039;s of close people. No one said that live was going to be easy. But you will be glad you are alive within 5 years. Luck does exist to. Fortune and even love. But they are not solid because you can not see or touch them. Wishing to be dead is a wish many have in you group of age. If you are in the worse group, you can be unhappy even untill you will be 25. Tops. In 5 years from now you will think different, and will be glad you are alive. But easy it is never going to be easy. I thinks it is good to talk with a knowledge of mine. It will be difficult over 5 years from now, because you will be used to be unhappy and even can be satisfied with your misery, like homelessness, addictions and so on. You may find out for your self too how to do your last thing with those barbiturates. But if you want to have the secret formula to do so, you will have to trade with your phone number. <br />Socrates had to drink poison that works somehow the same as I described. And I have described the terible horror of cyaankali. Take my course and keep it in your pocket till you think &quot;&quot;this is a good day to die&quot;&quot;. But take it from me. 5 years at most, and you will be glad to be alive. That is a mighty long time, but the 5 years from 12 till 17 era taking longer then the years from 18 till 23. Years will go faster and faster each and every year as you will grow older. You will even know now that the last 5 years have passed quicklier then the 5 yers there for. You will get by. When you will be 23 it will a better time to kill yourself. You have to give luck a change . And I am sure as your hormone-level will change you will grow out of this face wanting to die. Thousands and thousands have those feelings. No one talkes about it and those who succeed are kept from the media. I will see what you will do. I tell you infront that it can tkake a little more then one week, because that knowledge of mine has other responsebillety&#039;s too. Bur he will connect with you. You will know yhat he undersdtands you. He has concusions ready for what is for you still a question. Dieing you will do anyway. We all are going to die. You too. If you are somewhat scared to die, then he is the one to talk to too. And when you have obtained the barbiturates, see them as a assurance pollicy. That you from that point on you can chose to die painlessly whenever you want. Good bee one year from now or it could be tomorrow. In charge of your day day of dieing. But chose that day wisely. So I can help, but you know my conditions. You are just to young to make a irreverseble desission. I can not give the solution here for everyone to take the easy way out. First you have to have some talks with someone who is going to say some sensible but wise things to you.<br />Meanwhile life is are going to suck for some few years more. <br />Sorry<br />&nbsp;Wasta

				I&#039;m pretty fucking crazy, but that was a crazy fucking ramble. Dafuq did I just read? Why do you have a fucked up split open head avatar? Why did you condone his suicide, then ask for his phone number, then tell him to try five more years of life? What the fuck is wrong with you?

				wasta - no one wants to read a wall of rambling.<br /><br />and randomname: use the 1000$ to try all the drugs that are on here. get yourself some quality heroin at the end of your trip if you still really want to die, but... why? we all go through these times.<br /><br />seriously. you&#039;re not special - you&#039;re just like every other person in this world that doesn&#039;t have their head up their ass. sometimes we get depressed. suicidally depressed and for long periods of time. years. <br /><br />you aren&#039;t unique, not for being suicidal or (if you do) killing yourself. you&#039;ll be unique if you make the best of this dark period. write a book, or some shit. the most fucked up people often make for the best writers. or at least some really good stories. why not?<br /><br />and for the walking idea - if you want to die, why bother eating? just starve until you get emaciated and bloated and wither away :S
