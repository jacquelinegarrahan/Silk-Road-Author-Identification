				Ok so I&#039;ve sold at some shows, but never anything big time. I am looking to do a bigger operation with myself as well as a couple friends at a larger scale festival. I believe the only real thing to watch out for is undercovers. I&#039;ve been to a couple of big shows and saw a lot of people selling and no one I saw getting caught but I know it happens. I&#039;d really appreciate some tips and tricks if anyone has any. Here&#039;s what I&#039;ve thought about doing... <br /><br />Camping option, hide goods incredibly well to get a large scale amount into the area.<br />Have our tent be the center of operation, one person stay in the tent with the goods at all times<br />The others take a maximum of 5 grams at a time to sell, after the grams are sold come back with the money, leave it and take more out to sell.<br /><br />I believe using these methods would limit the likelihood of getting in trouble, but one thing I don&#039;t have an answer to is what is the best way to sell? In a huge mass of people just call out anyone need molly, or selectively pick smaller groups of people walking the grounds and move to a safe location to make the sale?

				actually what I am doing is the other way around<br /><br />come up to any groups and ask them if they know where to find molly<br /><br />this leave you time to test the water<br /><br />you ll probably have some of them saying they re also looking for drugs<br />if they do step in and ask them if they would be interested if you find some<br /><br />being straight forward with these thing could be a mistake especially if the person you r talking to is an undercover police<br /><br />also go interact with groups that are mixed with male and female<br />most of the undercover are male <br />undercovers are on a mission and they r not enjoying themselves its very easy to spot them<br />go find some people who are juggling,dancing,singing,ect.....<br /><br />as for the deal itself I would advise you to sit on the grass&nbsp; somwhere with a good panoramic <br /><br />always act like your clients are your friends and do not hesitate to spend a good 15 mn with them <br />as talking to stranger every 2 mn could ring the alarm<br /><br />

				I brought 51 pints and 8 quarts of BOMB Moonshine into a small local festival over the weekend. Sold it all in 16 hours without even really trying. The security was SHERIFF&#039;S DEPUTIES of the county. Head of Security? THE MOTHERFUCKING SHERIFF HIMSELF.<br /><br /><br /><br />His deputies bought two quarts from me at full price. And the Sheriff said that my liquor was too good to arrest me. When they searched my car on the way out, they found a QP of weed and a Half-pound of shrooms. They let me go without taking anything or arresting me. Funny shit having a COP HAND YOU BACK a half-pound of shrooms. Cool too.

				In the Southern United States. That particular county is hippified as all hell. Unfortunately the rest of the state is red as hell.<br /><br />In the next county over from there, a good friend of mine spent a YEAR in the county jail over a .15 gram roach that was mostly paper. I drove through there going home from the festival with the HP of Shrooms and QP of weed. <br /><br />There was also somebody there selling your molly from last summer (pre-brown batch whitish stuff, tasted EXACTLY the same as what I ended up with off of you last summer as well). I knew it was yours because he said it came from a German Pawnbroker who had been out of business for awhile. It was the best on the grounds, and he gave me a quarter gram because he liked my moonshine ALOT. There was also somebody selling JesusofRave&#039;s liquid there too, I knew because I could tell just holding the vial my DRUG Extra Sensory Perception started going crazy. He gave me two drops. I can confirm it was the same as the Christ blotter, just a little stronger, every bit as clean.<br /><br />Good time that, candy-flipping with YOUR girl Mandy and The Nectar of Jesus. Didn&#039;t expect to see either. Ended up being given both for free haha

Especially festivals that take place on the East Coast. There are a lot of Non-Fans that go, simply to sell drugs. Not for any other reason... and these people have a tendency to start shit with people, act hard, and/or rob people. If I recall, there&#039;s a couple of hot-shot Nitrious distributor faggots who corner the market @ shows between Boston, NYC, Philadelphia, and Baltimore with their gas, and they will physically harm ANY competition and rob other dealers, and people who give them shit. People call them; or they call themselves the &quot;Nitrous Mafia&quot;. <br /><br />You know it&#039;s them cause they all have city accents, wear black, prowl mostly in the dark, and carry white balloons and LED flashlights. They&#039;re loud and obnoxious. <br /><br />We also call them the &quot;tent tappers&quot; cause they roll around tapping balloons on tents yelling &quot;Headie Whippets!&quot; ... Again, obnoxious. Always leave your shit in your cars. Locked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>You guys have some thick tents over there!<br />Similar stuff happens here but the festivals I go to have such a community feel to them shit like this would never be tolerated, it&#039;s the security staff you want to watch out for, and they&#039;re pretty easy to spot in their hi vis.<br />I only bother selling NO2 as festivals, completely legal to posses and such a huge mark up, I certainly wouldn&#039;t bother if there was a Nitrous Mafia, although saying that I&#039;m sure if a similar thing was going down at Boomtown or Glade your fellow revelers would no doubt have your back.<br />One more reason not to live in the states!

				The safest bet is to not sell anything directly at the festival.&nbsp; Like everyone has said, be sociable, make some new friends and if possible sell far far away from the actual festival!&nbsp; A cheap hotel room or something like that is perfect for turning into the base of operations, and don&#039;t bring customers directly to where all your stash is located, funnel them around to different locals, just like you funnel your connection using tor.

				I posted the following in a couple of other threads regarding distributing at festivals.&nbsp; Feel free to quote and ask questions or shoot me a PM!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95420.msg677208#msg677208">Quote from: Drippy on December 22, 2012, 10:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) How to get it in &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />Getting what you need into the festival grounds will be the easy part.&nbsp; Generally for any size of festival besides very small local ones, they&#039;ll have a quick car search.&nbsp; Their sole purpose in this is to make sure you don&#039;t have any glass or wood from off the property (has to do w/ insects/diseases that put their trees at risk).&nbsp; Just make sure you don&#039;t stash anything in the cooler, and chances are they won&#039;t even come close to finding it.&nbsp; You really have to play it by ear, but worst case scenario if I see they&#039;re ripping apart cars I&#039;ll often just get out and walk to the ticketing area.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=95420.msg677003#msg677003">Quote from: opensky on December 22, 2012, 08:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you know the festival ground well, it is not too difficult to sneak in. <br /><br />Wired fences in the way? Metal plyers solve that easily. Quick way to get free admission and your stuff into the grounds no problem...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would absolutely NOT suggest sneaking in if you plan on vending unmentionables, unless you have a plan for getting a wristband or (preferably if you&#039;re a pro) credentials for VIP/vending/press/artist/staff/production.&nbsp; Having anyone w/ any sort of authority catch you w/o a wristband/laminate/sticky is just asking to be searched.&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting what you need into the concert area (if you&#039;re at a larger festival that has security between the stages and camping) is where things get a little more difficult.<br /><br />1. ALWAYS smile, and NEVER do anything to suggest that your time is being wasted by the 300lb dude cupping your balls in search of a flask of apple pie.&nbsp; They&#039;re working while everyone else is partying, so anything you can do to make them feel like they&#039;re a part of the party vs being the person trying to harsh your mellow helps<br /><br />2. My GOLDEN RULE is to show them you&#039;ve done this before and have nothing to hide by removing everything from your pockets (I like to throw everything in my hat and hold it in front of me), and if you&#039;re wearing a backpack have it in front of you with all the pockets open.&nbsp; If you have a hoody or something in there they&#039;re going to have to remove to search you, remove it for them and drape it over your arm.&nbsp; Anything you can do to speed up the process and show them you know you&#039;re about to get searched up and down is going to make it a lot less likely that they scrutinize your bag/pockets.&nbsp; Often I&#039;ll see the people in front of me get their shit RIPPED apart, and then when I walk up w/ everything presented in front of me ready to go I just get waved by w/ hardly even a glance into my bag.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use obvious/well-known places like your shoe, tucked in your belt, or openly in your hat.&nbsp; If you have a Grassroots hat w/ a secret pocket I&#039;d also be wary of using that, as security has caught onto that after 4yrs of that crew running around festivals lol.&nbsp; Secret pockets in backpacks, underwear, belts, shoes, etc are a good idea as long as they&#039;re well placed and well constructed.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use a pocket w/o a zipper and risk losing product just b/c it&#039;s a sly spot.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest against using battery compartments in flashlights as they often get checked, but usually cameras are ok (make sure you have press credentials if it&#039;s a DSLR though).&nbsp; Generally security doesn&#039;t want to touch your expensive camera, but they&#039;ll rip apart the $5 flashlight you have sitting by itself at the bottom of your bag.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to refrain from going over some of my more stealth methods publicly, but just use your head and you&#039;ll be able to think of a million sly spots to stash stuff.&nbsp; If security allows flags/blow-up toys and whatnot that&#039;s a good place to start brainstorming, especially if you&#039;re trying to get something bulky in like weed.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Who to sell to/where to sell/how to avoid LE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This will largely depend on your friend group attending the festival.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s always MUCH safer to only deal w/ friends of friends who are referred, but some people justify the risk of working w/ strangers is worth the reward.&nbsp; I generally will never mention anything to strangers, unless I&#039;ve spent a few minutes chatting w/ them already and can tell they&#039;re on the level.&nbsp; If you do decide to sell to complete strangers...<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Don&#039;t yell like many people have suggested already in the thread - feel like this should be common sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Don&#039;t be that shirtless sweaty rolling bro that darts through the crowd super fast whispering &quot;flame molly, WoW family fluff needle point&quot; into people&#039;s ears.&nbsp; It&#039;s creepy, and it won&#039;t attract the heads who know how this system works and will make transactions run smooth, but rather the first time fest goer who was just openly yelling asking if anyone had seen their sister molly or lucy a moment ago.&nbsp; I always prefer to have a very brief conversation w/ a group of kids that look cool, and then casually ask if they&#039;re doing good on [insert whatever I have here] tonight.&nbsp; More personal interactions make people feel much more comfortable, and give you a chance to briefly evaluate your future clientele before even mentioning anything.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; For something that samples are often asked for, have a little tool (mini coke spoon, key, etc) to hand a small sample that YOU&#039;VE measured out of a bag other than the one you&#039;re selling out of.&nbsp; Do NOT just hand people you don&#039;t know gram of moon rocks and expect them not to take a point rock as a &quot;tester&quot; then not buy anything.&nbsp; Generally I just prefer to say &quot;I&#039;ll stand here while you take a dip of what you buy, and if you don&#039;t like it you can punch me in the face&quot; instead of giving out samples.&nbsp; If they&#039;re not ok w/ that, then they were probably just looking for a free dip anyways. <br /><br />4)&nbsp; As I rule of thumb I will NEVER, regardless of whether I&#039;m selling to strangers or not, do business w/ someone who approaches me.&nbsp; Instead, only work w/ those who you&#039;ve approached.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if they have dreads and are rocking some limited release flatbrim w/ GDF wings on it and a $5000 wrap around their neck - kids who know what&#039;s up are NOT going to be asking randoms for drugs at a festival.&nbsp; Undercovers are not limited to people hired to do that at the festival.&nbsp; Often LE will get kids busted to flip on others by having them run around trying to find drugs while they follow them, watch the transaction, and then bust both of you (then obviously separate you and let the other guy go w/o charges).<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Try to do the majority of your business during the day and within the camping area.&nbsp; This eliminates a lot of the undercover presence, as generally undercovers are in the concert bowl looking for dumbasses, not sitting at a campsite smoking a bowl w/ a bunch of other wooks.&nbsp; Besides, you should be enjoying your festival and getting down to music at night.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; Space out the exchange of money and drugs - do one first, wait 30sec-1min, then do the other.&nbsp; Change of hands w/ a small something followed by change of hands the opposite direction w/ a wad of cash is what LE is looking for, and they generally won&#039;t do anything if they don&#039;t see money handed off right away.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; Do NOT sell drugs at your own campsite to people you don&#039;t know.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need word getting around that you&#039;re the man in the area w/ the fire shard, and that your tent is &quot;right over there ::points at tent::&quot;.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; I would highly suggest have a cheap wirelocked safe well-hidden in a car that you can drop stacks of cash off in.&nbsp; It&#039;s not gonna stop someone who&#039;s determined, but is enough deterrent to keep your friends girlfriend from trying to pluck a couple bucks off your stack when she goes back to the car to get sunscreen.&nbsp; Putting a luggage lock on your tent is NOT going to deter anyone, so have a plan as to how money and excess product will be stashed.&nbsp; However, keep in mind the melting point of whatever you have and how hot your car is going to get.&nbsp; Also, make sure there is a backup key or two w/in your crew for when one of you inevitably loses theirs.<br /><br />9) For powder drugs, keep quantity stashed in something that absorbs moisture if it&#039;s going to be humid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen ounces of cocaine basically ruined for the time being at festivals before.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and update this w/ any other info I think of, and feel free to pick my brain about anything I haven&#039;t mentioned.<br /><br />Cheers! -Drippy<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

Sold it all in 16 hours without even really trying. The security was SHERIFF&#039;S DEPUTIES of the county. Head of Security? THE MOTHERFUCKING SHERIFF HIMSELF.<br /><br /><br /><br />His deputies bought two quarts from me at full price. And the Sheriff said that my liquor was too good to arrest me. When they searched my car on the way out, they found a QP of weed and a Half-pound of shrooms. They let me go without taking anything or arresting me. Funny shit having a COP HAND YOU BACK a half-pound of shrooms. Cool too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />LMFAO hahahah lucky guy :D or its skill dont know hahha <br />+1 karma for you in about 60 hours :D <br />
