				Pretty much anything that isn&#039;t weed is out of your system in 3-5 days so I guess just don&#039;t do any more drugs? Assuming you are taking a urine drug screen.

				yeah what jack said, plus do some vigorous exercise every day until the test to try to get your metabolism up. try to piss a couple of times before the test, just make sure the test ISN&#039;T your first or second piss of the day - morning piss generally has more enzymes which could screw you. as Jack says make sure you catch the sample from mid stream, not the start or end.<br /><br />if they want a hair sample you might be fucked
