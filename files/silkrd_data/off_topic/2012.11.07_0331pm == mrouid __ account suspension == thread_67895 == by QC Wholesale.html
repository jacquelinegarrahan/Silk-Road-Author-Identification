				-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA1<br /><br />As you probably know by now my seller&#039;s account has been suspended on Silk Road.&nbsp; When I asked for an explanation Silk Road Support claimed that I was encouraging buyers to conduct transactions outside of escrow.&nbsp; If you&#039;re one of the hundreds of customers I&#039;ve dealt with you probably know that I never encouraged anyone to do any such thing. <br /><br />The only situation I can think of is a fellow from B.C. was asking to buy 30 Lbs a week from me and I let him know that it would be difficult to accommodate that volume in BTC due to the difficulties of transferring large amounts BTC into $$$.&nbsp; I told him that to do such a transaction we would have to work out an alternative means of payment.&nbsp; However this never materialized nor did I expect it to since I frequently get such outlandish requests that are not serious.<br /><br />Not once have I actually dealt with anyone outside of Silk Road whom I had originally contacted here.&nbsp; There were a few instances when I accepted direct payment (through Silk Road&#039;s &quot;Send bitcoins to another member&quot; feature) but never did I encourage anyone to send payment this way.&nbsp; Some customers would pay me this way without my ever authorizing it or I would allow it (stupidly) in rare circumstances when customers didn&#039;t have enough coin to pay for a listing and I was too overwhelmed with orders and/or Silk Road was going too slowly to go through the process of making a custom orders for them. <br /><br />However never did I encourage that and numerous times declined offers to accept direct payment in exchange for a reduction in price.&nbsp; I feel that Silk Road well-deserves the small commission that they charge and never felt that I should try to bypass it for any reason.&nbsp; If fact I would gladly pay double the normal commission charged by Silk Road for any direct payments that have ever been received into my account (amounting to a negligible amount compared to the business I bring them in any case).<br /><br />I would like your honest opinions.&nbsp; Do you think that my account suspension was deserved?&nbsp; Do you think that Silk Road will benefit as a result?&nbsp; I have plenty of loyal customers who will take their business to wherever I decide to go.&nbsp; But I would much rather stick with Silk Road and conduct my business here.&nbsp; They&#039;ve helped me achieved everything that I have and I feel that I owe them my loyalty.<br /><br />Mr Ouid<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQmn01AAoJEAaPGHMucDPU7wgH/3rjiOVPOt8qEpA+RcbJiQEv<br />QPcHhoo6izu5kPCJVKA+rZeqJZBl6tdhN0igQFRCf3oqmkxxrXlrPF43u2BXYMXB<br />dyp1pHhwCzcTt5gSwtVUE8JOA7OiZb0uVSSLc1VURP1Qka3AgU3/ki+ZfnN0clWr<br />WZ1xN5/fPiGSMvMFt3y1QYSecFbQPUYjkTU18w7Dc7LNgVYRjTBAD26yezZcmY89<br />xtwZbl+XVXC+t4uaMRKp6FRHCI34AUiDj1P7lCjatoRpZ3dYe52P3QCx/AIYQuSq<br />wm83EGiWE9kwZVFLBPNtjm86sXeVc7fEjWTwqixWzVHgZsNciiRlWk5zXjboHcc=<br />=5Cve<br />-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQENBE37moUBCACaoNZGs0Ifdud07aVuVzSt6mZCRlGY23KXDLZOQ1MNZp+q4PQ8<br />PjfjAaJ5QTKlFfKuOKacBsYjRzcvkDGGvZHAr1H08qNlzL8BSaGk8A7UJT8aL59n<br />5ewAbQVfqdQ+mBhdDl/m7QcRrOu20NDUSxPddf+2Huq2CzzO4dfT2lGK2NHS31dZ<br />D7SkuQBlAb+ei57PJGw001WZKkA2NmcQ0pn2YxV4R1lxTvzrtrmwqh1PU3kj7XuL<br />hYMKbI0cUzZECYIYCcUqvbjtE3EDuJpbDg1tfQOvvCGYDw2VZbkapywq/ovjW/K4<br />KXSHsN4+NPr1Z6usV0AmIRZF8dNtNhJT8L6XABEBAAG0Jm1yb3VpZCA8bXJvdWlk<br />QDVvbnduc3BqdnVrN2N3dmsub25pb24+iQE4BBMBAgAiBQJN+5qFAhsPBgsJCAcD<br />AgYVCAIJCgsEFgIDAQIeAQIXgAAKCRAGjxhzLnAz1OdCB/9aCA6cOAYgTx9i/3+e<br />KSsXvhEPyAgNUNwNT+EDv4OgjCq0Z6ZbOgDWSTSZ370WRCPxOs5vx6lBPHqu3r30<br />fNDYQW/DwtbKjIoKjSVV22KSst3mnNShzAH/WkyED5S9hkTjk5l4wa2PVfsSM2DT<br />EEyKKLkLEtDovkBYYEQwza2BwW4f6xGpO+ZpwpkGlcO/Z4NrCmmoaL/cJkW6Ny19<br />vd2lVHm4fc+ruZXUXgGHI+tv9k3dBEpq5I8G9DYu7ysyjwCdyaj1gTgbDkxT00Cg<br />YoQWuANDj+SdrXaifSM+A2EKB8tL05+Ie/Y/HN9a2+M89UFrDp8pqcEyGIoeew/8<br />cwIW<br />=Huve<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />

				You do realize you were most likely scammed out of the account by competition.<br />Even vendors aren&#039;t safe from scamming in it&#039;s many various forms.<br />It&#039;s obvious someone went to a bit of trouble to make you look guilty.<br />It&#039;s not like you are a new vendor, you&#039;ve kicked on the road as long as i can remember.<br />Someone made up buyer accounts and sought to give you grief for what ever the reason.<br />SR Support and DPR doesnt just suspend accounts with getting information from more than just one source.<br />They are busy enough just trying to keep the road from getting overwhelmed from all the traffic it gets.<br /><br /><br />Just this guys opinion.<br />Did your account deserve to get suspended, probably not but when they get complaints they have to react or you get another asshole walking off into the sunset with 10k of someone else&#039;s money.<br /><br /><br /><br />x)<br />nomad bloodnath

				Hey I just registered so I can post on this subject. <br /><br />I can first say that Mr Ouid is a legit, professional vendor. His shipping methods are top notch and he&#039;s the reason why plenty of people around the world are getting M39. His reputation and client list show that he is the reason why people come to SR, for a reliable and consistent vendor. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad, as a loyal customer of Mr Ouid, that he is doing the right thing and being loyal to SR. I&#039;m happy to know he is taking the initiative to fix what was wrong, pay SR what they EARNED and pay double apparently, <br /><br />In a shitty world of schemers and fakes, its comforting to know that people can still have character, in any business field. <br /><br />Now the accusations of him wanting to deal off SR, well, that is wrong and if everyone did that then SR would be down. And I can see how getting some bitcoins transferred directly to his account was wrong. I feel that after all this and how is business is being affected negatively, that he wouldn&#039;t dare to risk his reputation again. <br /><br />On the same note, getting large amounts of money converted to bitcoins is a problem. If buyers wanted to get over his 2LB, then there should be some other way to accommodate those needs without risking safety and his reputation. But most buyers don&#039;t even fall into that category, but if SR wanted to collaborate for a solution then that would be great.<br /><br />I feel that SR did the right thing of checking Mr Ouid because no one should fuck around with another person&#039;s lively hood. The idea of the Silk Road is genius, let&#039;s all support it. <br /><br />I&#039;m not saying any of the accusations are true but it&#039;s good to know that SR aren&#039;t chumps and will quickly step in.<br /><br />Its even better to know that Mr Ouid is doing whats right by paying up, and keeping in touch with the community.<br /><br /><br /><br />To Mr Ouid: good luck man, I look forward to seeing you back on the vendor list soon.<br /><br />To SR: Mr Ouid is one of the top vendors in the community, he is the reason why people come to SR, for a reliable, consistent vendor.&nbsp; <br />I hope that you allow Mr Ouid to come back and if you felt the need to suspend his account then I&#039;m happy for you guys for acting immediately because if one person did it then everyone else will try it. Paying you guys is the reason why we have such an amazing concept and website. I&#039;m thankful for what you guys do and I hope you get every penny you earned. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This deepnet and SR is like an underground world. We check each other and anyone can speak up. Let&#039;s keep this community thriving! <br /><br />--From A Trusting Buyer--<br />

				No warnings.&nbsp; Not even an explanation just an automated message that my account suspended due to violation of TOS.&nbsp; They later gave me a very brief response saying what I said.&nbsp; I would have expected some kind of warning especially considering I bring in over $5000 of business per day with anywhere from 2% - 10% of that paid to Silk Road in fees.

				&nbsp;&gt;:( <br /><br />I had to follow suit and create an account here just to back up mrouid! I&#039;ve had 2 flawless transactions with him and have never been coerced into dealing outside escrow. I really hope to continue to do business with him on SR!. I just finalized a transaction that I received today and its amazing! This was my first bulk purchase on SR and the shipping is absolutely professional and with very clever attention to stealth. I can&#039;t stand to see such a great vendor taken away when I was just getting started!<br /><br /><br />To say the least I&#039;m disappointed&nbsp; :(

				I don&#039;t really know much about this whole issue, but I did read a few threads on the Rumor Mill area about Mr.ouid and if what is said here is true then perhaps SR will take a bit more time to look into it.<br /><br />Hope you get some luck Mr.ouid and this was all just a huge misunderstanding.<br /><br />makku

				&quot;I would like your honest opinions.&nbsp; Do you think that my account suspension was deserved?&nbsp; Not without asking the circumstances, when you have earned one if not the top vendor spot on SR communication prior to suspension would be expected unless it was for scamming<br />Do you require a suspension.......well if you violated the rules there needs to be some recourse but you have come here to tell your story ( in a professional manner) like your business <br /><br />&nbsp;Do you think that Silk Road will benefit as a result?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not a chance<br />&nbsp;I have plenty of loyal customers who will take their business to wherever I decide to go.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I love SR but the truth is if I knew your were conducting business elsewhere because you couldn&#039;t conduct it here I would follow and send the occasional order your way but would prefer to do it in the SR community!<br />&nbsp; But I would much rather stick with Silk Road and conduct my business here.&nbsp; They&#039;ve helped me achieved everything that I have and I feel that I owe them my loyalty.&quot;&nbsp; most of my purchases would be still done at SR buy you have a domestic product that I like and I always like to have some at hand to smoke<br /><br /><br />

				I, for one, will be taking my business wherever mrouid goes whether that be back to Silk Road, or elsewhere. He has not encouraged, nor asked this. But I simply would not order large quantities of product from any other vendor. I have the utmost confidence in mrouid, and the utmost respect for how he conducts his business. I have never had one bad transaction with him.<br /><br />This whole debacle came about as the result of underhanded tactics by a competitor, mtljohn, and it is disgusting to see. I have always refused to stand for injustice here, and this time will be no different. I have said all I need to say in other threads on this matter - to allow a competitor bring such a well respected vendor into disrepute would be a huge mistake; mrouid&#039;s suspension will be a HUGE loss to both Silk Road as a business entity, and as a community.<br /><br />His contribution to Silk Road is immense, and he has many hundreds of satisfied fans and customers who will vouch for him. He has never encouraged OOE sales - not for large orders, nor small. This is an injustice, plain and simple; and WE, the people, will not stand for injustice.<br />When a system begins to allow injustices to occur, it is not long before that system becomes rotten to its very core. Do any of us want that for Silk Road? No, of course we don&#039;t. We need to make a stand here against such behaviour. SR Support is swamped with messages - however, I feel it is our duty to make them know how much we want mrouid here as a vendor, and as a contributor to our community.<br /><br />Send a message of solidarity with mrouid to SR Support, and ensure they realise how much their business and our community will suffer if such an injustice is allowed to take precedence over what is right.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				SR - Sorry to say, but just about every &quot;Major&quot; vendor I&#039;ve dealt with here and built a relationship with has allowed me to send bitcoins directly to their user name for custom orders.&nbsp; If this is what he was banned for, this is, in my opinion, bullshit.&nbsp; Custom orders are a pain in the ass for vendors!&nbsp; When you have 6.3 bitcoins for a purchase that is 7 bitcoins, the vendor is doing you a favor by allowing you to send said coins directly for either the full product, or a reduced amount.&nbsp; Sure, you may lose a bit of commission from these one off deals, but they are in the far minority.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know the entire story, but banning a member for letting people pay directly, especially a vendor that does his volume of business is BS.&nbsp; If that is your policy, you need to look at just about everyone here, because the majority of vendors have done it once or twice.<br /><br />Now - if something else was going on, like having this occur weekly, or moneypacks, or whatever, then by all means I understand, but banning someone for a few one off transactions isn&#039;t OK in my book.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my word doesn&#039;t mean anything...

You&#039;re too new here to know this, but there was a time when OOE deals were used for bulk purchases with the full approval of Silk Road admins. Many vendors, including mrouid, made use of that function including for my first ever SR purchase, which was a $2000+ value. First transaction, totally new here, and mrouid (or any of the other vendors, for that matter) could easily have walked off with that money and I wouldn&#039;t have been able to do a damn thing about it. But he didn&#039;t. He conducted himself in a professional manner, and continued to do so thereafter, even when OOE sales were discontinued. He never required FE, and he always maintained excellent communication with his customers.<br /><br />If a customer was unhappy with the prices, they wouldn&#039;t have bought the product, hence would not have been &quot;buttfucked&quot; as you so eloquently put it. Your story has far too many holes in it, and all the right motivation.<br /><br />I have the funniest feeling that this &quot;client&quot; you speak of is a separate account belonging to you. And you would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&#039;t for those pesky kids, eh?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg573000#msg573000">Quote from: Dankbank1 on November 08, 2012, 01:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We want mrouid back!!!!!!

				This really sounds like a load of bull shit to be honest. I dont mean to be hasty but it seems to be a bit of reverse psychology going on. <br /><br />So mrouids if you were bringing in $5000 a day then surely you could easily start a new account with a new name and be anonymous again. Yea it would mean starting over which isn&#039;t the end of the world and could be a good thing.<br /><br />mtjohn I have been noticing your comments and threads for a while now. Sir there is a time when it&#039;s best not to speak<br /><br />I&#039;m just saying?<br /><br />I know it&#039;s none of my business but it&#039;s fun to add my 2 cents to the great weed dealers cut throat competition. This is much better than hiring hit men to go shoot up the neighbor hood&nbsp; over who&#039;s selling weed on who&#039;s turf

				Just to set the record straight:&nbsp; One of my clients did in fact tell mtljohn that I had dealt a large amount with him outside of escrow.&nbsp; He admitted to me that he had lied to mtljohn to inflate his buyer stats so that he could obtain free samples.&nbsp; He also contacted vendor support to explain the situation to them.&nbsp; So at least in this respect mtljohn is not lying about the information that he received he&#039;s just mistaken about the facts since I never in fact sold anything to this client outside of escrow.&nbsp; I did make him custom listings on several occasions amounting to around $10,000 over a period of a few months but never did I ask him to nor did we deal outside of escrow.

				Hi there,<br /><br />Most of the time I avoid to post in this kind of polemical threads but there is point that really worries me : is it so easy to get a seller suspended or banned ? <br />Mrouid is on SR since a very long time, he&#039;s a well known vendor with an excellent reputation, in my opinion he&#039;s the kind of seller a customer expects to find on SR. If only a few anonymous testimonies are enough to get him suspended it makes things really easy for anyone who wants to harm a reputable vendor.<br /><br />WL

Do you really lack such basic reasoning skills?!&nbsp; :o<br /><br />And if you &quot;have the words from your mouth in my inbox&quot;, then it was indeed you acting as another customer. You cannot have first hand information from a source in your inbox unless you directly interacted with that source. In this case, the source is mrouid. You claim it was a client of his that messaged you, yet you have &quot;the words from [mrouid&#039;s] mouth&quot; in your inbox!

Are you 16? 17 perhaps? Either way, you&#039;re too immature to ever receive an iota of respect here.<br /><br />I suggest you keep your &quot;expamles&quot; to yourself if you want to halt the ridicule being directed at you; if not, we&#039;re all having a good laugh tearing you and your other &quot;expamles&quot; to shreds.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg574925#msg574925">Quote from: mtljohn on November 08, 2012, 07:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You are a lying scammer and you deserve to be banned and to never come back!&nbsp; how dare you try to scam DPR??<br /><br /><br />lol.. and I&#039;m the bad guy right??<br /><br />mrouid... would you like to to post the convos i had with your clients so everyone can see, or should I just send them to DPR so he can see???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can you point out a) who mrouid has scammed, and b) why you have such a large interest in mrouid being &quot;banned and to never come back&quot;?

Just in case justice prevails.<br /><br />&quot;How dare you try to scam DPR&quot;?!?!?! This is hilarious coming from the guy who advertised &quot;SR down specials&quot; in order to sell product commission free! You&#039;re literally THE most hypocritical person I&#039;ve ever had the pleasure of berating here on the forum! And that&#039;s quite an accomplishment, so kudos to you!<br /><br />If DPR has taken a look at any of your posts here it is highly unlikely he/she is going to believe anything you send to them.

Hilarity will ensue!<br /><br />Also I should probably point out that your &#039;client&#039; speaking strangely like you, &quot;bro&quot;, is incredibly suspicious. And that mrouid doesn&#039;t really speak like that; he has also been cashing out huge amounts of Bitcoin for over a year - he certainly has a number of different methods for cashing out, and as someone who keeps very up to date with the Bitcoin markets and developments therein, there have been no developments of late that would reduce the methods in which mrouid can cash out various amounts of Bitcoin.<br /><br />You don&#039;t see mrouid selling yet because he isn&#039;t.&nbsp; ::)<br />I&#039;ve been in touch with SR Support, and in their most recent message a couple of hours ago they stated that are currently discussing matters with him, as well as DPR taking it upon him/herself to look into it personally. I&#039;ll stake my reputation on mrouid being back very shortly, and with any luck you&#039;ll be turfed out for breaking the TOS and for attempted sabotage of a rival vendor, as well as economically harming the Road and negatively affecting our community as a whole.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I did so when mrouid&#039;s account was suspended as it appeared as though that action was taken as a result of the claims you made. When the full story came to light, and I had contacted mrouid, he explained the situation to me. With the evidence presented to me, and the manner in which each person carried themselves in the face of that evidence, along with your stated goal via private message of ridding yourself of the competition I came to the logical conclusion that something didn&#039;t quite add up on your end.<br /><br />I explained the above just last night; perhaps you need to lay off the drugs a little if they&#039;re messing you up that much.<br /><br />I&#039;m a puppet you say? For whom? For mrouid? I took it upon myself to come to the forums to defend him; he did not ask nor encourage me to do so. I did it because I respect him and value him as a member of the Silk Road community, just as he respects and values us, his customers. I have yet to see one of these so-called &quot;unsatisfied customers&quot; come to the forum to back up you and your claims. Perhaps you lacked the foresight to make forum profiles for these &quot;clients&quot;, and you know that a freshly registered profile would carry no weight and would be fairly obvious as a shill account.<br /><br />The noticeable lack of any of these &quot;unsatisfied customers&quot;, and the prevalence of mrouid&#039;s satisfied customers, speaks volumes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg575256#msg575256">Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I will capitalize the important words<br /><br />mrouid(99) It&#039;s going to be at least $3600 going through silk road.

Having read the &quot;quotes&quot; in their entirety, and in the context which they were stated, I maintain that mrouid would not have cash sent to a drop location (i.e. a real life transaction). I don&#039;t think even you would be that stupid, and given that mrouid is clearly of a much higher intelligence than you, I know for a fact that he is not that stupid. Ergo your little story above makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg575256#msg575256">Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">IF YOU WANT TO STICK UP FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT WHO IS WILLING TO SCREW DPR THEN YOU MY FRIEND SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!&nbsp; DPR DESERVES HIS MONEY AND MROUID TRIED TO CHEAT HIM OUT OF HIS MONEY.......

YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW IT...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You were willing to screw DPR with &quot;SR down specials&quot;, which I have pointed out multiple times and you stated was &quot;a mistake&quot;; you knowingly violated the terms of the Seller&#039;s Guide which you agreed to abide by upon becoming a vendor, and if you did not do so knowingly, you have not yet read the Seller&#039;s Guide meaning you shouldn&#039;t be doing business here - so drop the &quot;good citizen / looking out for DPR&quot; act.<br /><br />The customer that claimed he bought 3 pounds off mrouid OOE has mailed SR Support stating that it was a fabrication, which mrouid has told us right here in this thread. If he is lying on that point, DPR will know about it and take it into consideration when delivering his / her judgement on the matter.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t make a difference to me or most of mrouid&#039;s other customers whether he comes back or not; we will do business with him wherever he ends up. He used to have an account on BMR and if he returns there, or decides to set up his own site, he will get our business. Silk Road will lose the most professional vendor it has ever seen, the huge amount of commission from his sales, and our community will lose a large number of contributors who strongly believe in an agorist society. We will leave this place because we believe in true justice; if that is not delivered, we will be violating our own principles by advocating a corrupt system that allows injustices to occur.<br /><br />If mrouid were conducting sales out of escrow he would not have been in the top 2% of vendors - his vendor statistics, namely his number of transactions, would ensure he didn&#039;t reach the top 2%.<br /><br />Your little scam is coming crashing down around you, and you&#039;re becoming more and more desperate. Anybody who has even a passing interest in psychology will notice that. Your continued interest and insistence here on the forum shows that you are desperate for people to believe your story; as its constructor, that is entirely understandable. Fabricating an untruth requires that people believe it lest you seem like a liar, hence your insistence that it is true - which, ironically, is cementing your reputation as a liar.<br />You aren&#039;t half as smart as you think you are, mtljohn. Never assume that you are the sharpest tool in the box - the sharpest tool is only sharp because it is rarely used; that analogy applies to the mind.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg575256#msg575256">Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WHY STILL STAND UP FOR A GUY WHO SCREWS THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS PLACE POSSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO US.<br /><br />fuck that... long live dpr and&nbsp; sr!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why still stand up for this vendor? I am standing up for him because I believe him over you, as does every other poster here. We have much more reason to trust mrouid than trust you - I mean look at yourself... You&#039;re coming across as insane.&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Again, quit the &quot;long live dpr and sr&quot; crap; nobody is buying it. You care for nobody but yourself; you&#039;re the ultimate narcissist. I&#039;m sorry to tell you, but such people are not well accepted by this community - as is evident by your mass of negative karma, signifying that a huge amount of people disagree with what you say and how you say it.<br /><br />Good luck mtljohn. You&#039;ll certainly need it - both here on Silk Road, and in life in general.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Mrouid has never once asked me to deal outside of SR or escrow. All of my transactions have been perfect. Honestly if mrouid was to stop selling it would be a great loss to the sr community and SR.&nbsp; I will stand by mrouid and say that he is a fantastic seller. And from what i see, he has been framed/set up. Hopefully this weill get resolved because this is costing people time and money, when they just want to get back to business. I hope your seller rights are returned to you mrouid!

				mtljohn- you and me both know that you dont give 2 shits about the fact that DPR&#039;s commision was taken from him on a few sales. you wanted your #1 competition who was kicking your ass and taking all your customers gone so that you could take his spot as the #1 canadian cannabis seller on SR. <br /><br />In some of your old threads i stood up for you and agreed that what you were doing wasn&#039;t wrong when you were getting bashed for calling your product better than his. That was totally acceptable in my book its healthy market competition<br /><br />This however is very pathetic on your part. youre just playing dirty in desperation trying to do anything you can to bring yourself to the top. After seeing this post me, and all of my business associates will never use your service, sorry.&nbsp;

				I have conducted thousands of $$ with MrO and will only ever use MrO. <br /><br />Dread has created the greatest strike for our cause and for liberal freedom to be restored, but as an underground movement sometimes you only have a certain amount of b/c and MrO is cool he will let you pay 1/2 now half on arrival, cause of the trust, because Dread created this community. But MrO did enough in escrow to never deserve an account suspension. MrO is a hero, a freedom fighter and an inspiration.<br /><br />We are one community.

Don&#039;t you think your taking this too far now?&nbsp; I don&#039;t want anything to do with this, but I am fed up with the drama ensuing across the many discussion boards. Threads, threads, and threads? For what? You have your vendors account, focus on business and your reputation. Let mrouid get on with his. If you are displeased with the way SilkRoad is operating or their decision with reinstating mrouids vendors account, then terminate your vendors account, and get on with your life. I feel your very frustrated but enough is enough! Please go and focus your energies on something more productive, like boosting your reputation. Please see this post as some impartial advice with best of intentions for you :)

				Got nothing bad to say about Mrouid, Ive&nbsp; only ordered off him once but my experience with him was nothing but good. Hes been vending for over a year and he managed to maintain a ratting of 99% that says alot and it shows he cares about his custies.
