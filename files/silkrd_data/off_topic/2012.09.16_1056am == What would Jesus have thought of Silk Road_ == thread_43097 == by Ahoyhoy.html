				I am not a christian and I do not know what would Jesus think of SR, but I know what would SOME christians today think of SR. The christian dogmatic opinion regarding drugs would probably consider us a bunch of lost souls or devil&#039;s people.

				<br />I doubt there would be any fundamentalist Christian SR users but basically how they would reconcile it would depend on the image of Jesus that they believe in. So he would probably be against it if you think that that image is a religious puritan one &quot;drugs corrupting the mind/purity of God&quot;- or something along those lines.<br /><br />But then again you could justify it with the left wing hippie notion of Jesus which is basically just a cool dude that was full of love with something like &quot;to each his own&quot;. <br /><br />Besides, if Jesus was really into the whole God/spirituality thing then I&#039;m sure he&#039;d approve of DMT.

I&#039;d get why they&#039;d believe in infinite realms/dimensions and beings of knowledge so mind blowing that it isn&#039;t worth even trying to explain in words, but a guy that lived thousands of years ago who was sent by the creator of the universe to die on a peace of wood..?

So &quot;Jesus&quot; being the &quot;son&quot; of &quot;God&quot; is basically just a fancy way of saying that the universe evolved humanity by its very nature.<br /><br />In which case Jesus wouldn&#039;t think anything, because he&#039;s just a metaphor for humanity&#039;s connection to the universe

				My interpretation of Jesus: he would probably be indifferent and continue breaking bread off for us (which isnt socialism btw. socialism is if Jesus&#039; government forced him and everybody around him to share his bread.&nbsp; his sharing was elective. using socialism as a dirty word is comical at best)<br /><br /><br />His followers today: see us as the enemy. we are the corruption. we are the bad guys doing the devils work<br /><br />i am agnostic and god does not feature among the things I believe to exist.

				Is it a coincidence that there isn&#039;t a commandment relating to not taking drugs? <br /><br />Mind you, there is no commandment relating to rape or child molesting. Lust after your neighbour&#039;s misses and you&#039;re going to hell but fine to be a kiddy fiddler or a rapist.<br /><br />If Jesus took LSD, would he feel closer to his dad?

				Christians say Jesus is God. When you take LSD, you have a decent chance of experiencing God in a much more powerful way than most do in Church. People buy LSD on SR. Thus SR helps people experience Jesus. Jesus would therefore endorse SR.

				I&#039;m sure it would be something to the effect of &quot;this must be some magic box in order for it to have a road traveling though it. But the only way you can travel into this magic box is through me because I am the son of the father and.......fuck I am too tired for this shit Jesus would have thought the same about people selling LSD on SR the same way he looked at the people eating manna in the desert. I mean they had to have tripped some serious BALLS on that manna to create a religion that lasted as long as it had based on their visions and revelations (hallucinations)

				Actually genesis infers that as humans have dominion over all the plants and animals, so I imagine Jesus would have been anti-prohibition. <br /><br />Also you&#039;ll find the bible is on the whole very pro-alcohol. There are more passages that revere / encourage / speak fondly of wine than there are that denounce drunkenness etc.

				Interesting question.<br /><br />I think Jesus would be happy with SR.<br />For one, he didn&#039;t surround himself with prim and proper do-gooders. He hung out and defended people who were looked down on by the rest of society.<br />Second, I believe drugs can be a gateway to realms outside of our world, and can invoke &quot;religious&quot; experiences. This can help a person open their minds to the possibility that there is much more to this world than appears, or even that this world is an illusion. Even though drugs are just a chemical reaction happening in our body and mind, they still may have been created for us to see beyond the veil. <br />The APPLE of Genesis?<br />If he was against intoxication, he wouldn&#039;t turn water into wine.<br /><br />Being a revolutionary figure, I think he would show interest in SilkRoad, but would probably not like BitCoins. <br /><br />And the question about if he even existed....who fucking knows-<br />but I personally think chances are very high that he did.<br />I think he&#039;s cool regardless if he lived or not, just the concept of him opened my mind.<br /><br />Just DONT call me Christian!!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				...yeah Jesus and his brother Jose both wash dishes down the street and the Mexican restaurant. <br /><br />I showed Jesus...and once he realized what I was showing him..he ran through the dining room into the kitchen...out the back door and last I could see he was jumping a chain link fence. <br /><br /><br />Never even looked back. <br /><br />So I don&#039;t know WTF that means, but maybe it answers your question.<br /><br />Want me to ask Jose too? :\<br />

				I read this joke a little while back, it&#039;s kinda on point, and very truesay! <br /><br />Jesus and drugs <br /><br />Jesus, in a very worried state, convened all of his apostles and disciples to an emergency meeting because of the high drug consumption problem all over the world.<br />&nbsp;<br />After giving it much thought they reached the conclusion that in order to better deal with the problem, that they should try the drugs themselves and then decide on the correct way to proceed.<br />&nbsp;<br />It was therefore decided that a commission made up of some of the members return to earth to get the different types of drugs.<br />&nbsp;<br />The secret operation is effected and two days later the commissioned disciples begin to return to heaven.<br />&nbsp;<br />Jesus, waiting at the door, lets in the first disciple:<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s Paul&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;&quot;What did you bring Paul?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Hashish from Morocco&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Very well son, come in.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s Mark&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;&quot;What did you bring Mark?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Marijuana from Colombia&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Very well son, come in.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s Matthew&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;&quot;What did you bring Matthew?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Cocaine from Bolivia&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Very well son, come in.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s John&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;&quot;What did you bring John?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Crack from New York&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Very well son, come in.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s Luke&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;&quot;What did you bring Luke?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Speed from Amsterdam&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;Very well son, come in.&quot;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;It&#039;s Judas&quot;<br />&nbsp;Jesus opens the door.<br />&nbsp;What did you bring Judas?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&quot;The DRUG SQUAD....

				OK, I&#039;ve given this some thought. Some Bible-sourced pesudo-truths to help us navigate our way through this philosophical conundrum:<br /><br />1. Politically, Jesus was center-left and liberals seem to predominate on SR for sure. I bet even JC would get bad karma on these messageboards though.<br />2. Unlike Islam, Christianity does not condemn those who abuse their bodies through alcohol or drugs (at least there is little mention of this in the Bible and &#039;thout shall not get wasted&#039; conspicuous by its absence in the 10 commandments)<br />3. Jesus was attracted to the flotsam and jetsum of society. Silk Road is also a magnet for F and fucking&nbsp; J. Take me for example - a freak in real life but part of the mainstream on SR.<br />4. Although there is no evidence of JC taking drugs in the good book, the Turin Shroud was indeed made of hemp and he once made the wine flow at a wedding ceremony in the new testament. Think about his; if he can make a few fishes and a bit of bread feed 5000, think what he could do with a gram of coke.<br />5. As I&#039;ve mentioned before, some say that a good LSD trip can bring you closer to God. So if JC ever wanted to catch up with his Dad, he just needs to drop a few shrooms and bingo!<br />6. For sure, Jesus would not have approved some of the steep prices being charged on SR. Vendors beware - If you want to go to heaven, start offering some wicked deals.&nbsp; <br />7. There is evidence that Jesus would have benefitted from drugs during his lifetime. Skunk-induced paranoia might have helped him to rumble Judas and if Judas had been a bit more loved up in the first place, he might not have done the dirty on JC.<br /><br />I call that evidence. It&#039;s conclusive then. JC would have been a Roadie.

				^^ Was Jesus was attracted to the flotsam and jetsum of society? Or was it the case that they were just the social &#039;class&#039; he moved within, and the &#039;higher nobility&#039; was shut off to him?<br /><br />Personally, it may be hard for some to accept that when you die, you just die. No-one cares if there was a life before your born! Well maybe those that believe in reincarnation do. I think what happens after we die will be like it felt before we were born - nothing (less than nothing, as nothing still implies the absence of something). When I accepted that it freed me to move on and just live life.<br /><br />I do believe Jesus the human did exist, I think historians would agree? And I believe he probably was a really good guy with some good ideas, I just think it&#039;s a shame he took the religious angle. Although religion can be beneficial at the personal level, large scale religion has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Soz if this is rambling bullshit, I&#039;m not totally sober ATM.
