				So I wanted to know what everybodys favorites were from this family- and what the experience was like<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken 2ce and 2ci.&nbsp; 2ce was awesome until i took some moonrocks and had to puke, i feel like just the 2ce would&#039;ve been nice.&nbsp; The 2ci i took and was incredibly trippy but i had horrible anxiety the entire time (I was also lost in the woods with no flash light so that may have played into it).&nbsp; i want to try a few of the others, I enjoy lsd and a dopey roll, not too much a fan of the coke feel, so I just kind of want to hear others experiences to choose my next path if you will.

				This thread might help you, hxxp://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/276927-What-s-your-favorite-2C-X/page15 -- take the poll with a grain of salt, remember that some of the 2c&#039;s are harder to obtain than others.<br /><br />2c-b is great btw.&nbsp; 2c-i is one of my favorite currently unscheduled.

				I tried foxys smarties(2cb), first 2c experience, for the first time a couple weeks back. I was only at 10mg and I fucking loved it. I&#039;m a bit paranoid of getting abover that 15mg point, apparently that&#039;s when shit gets real. I&#039;m eager to order and try all of them in an academic setting, although that&#039;ll definitely be further down the road. this is due to financial reasons rather than a lack of genitalia reason :P <br /><br />I found myself thinking at the pace and pattern that I used to think at in high school. It was brilliant! I was recently reading about 2cd on erowid, how a gent in Germany I believe it was was dosing college students and they would report on their change after two months. Clearly was trying to be marketed as a &quot;smart pill.&quot; Fuck, I&#039;ll give it a try as a smart pill, my dumbass needs any chemical help available lol

				Id say go with 2CB if you can handle the really intense 2C&#039;s but if you want the best 2C and think you can handle it 2CT7 wins hands down, check out some expierences on erowid and read about it on Pihkal a chemical love story book.

				I only have experience with:<br />2C-P&nbsp; - very potent, very wide spectrum of effects. Low doses are very fun without negative effects for most people. Higher doses are more entheogenic and with more negative side effects (I got serious stomach cramps, and very heavy body load) . I&#039;m very curious to experiment with this one more.<br />2C-B&nbsp; - disappointing experience. Did 20mg. oral and few hours later 10mg. insufflated (epic nose burn). Very slight visuals, some directionless stimulation (with a nice rush when insufflated), lots of laughs... Not what I&#039;m looking for in my drugs. Maybe I&#039;ve got crappy 2c-b, I would give different batch a try.<br /><br />2C-T-2&nbsp; - next in line for me.

				@Bob - 20mg oral is a very low dose, especially if you had the HBr salt which you likely did. You should go for 30mg-40mg oral depending on the level of your tolerance if you&#039;re into the heavier psychs like 2C-P.

				I have some 2C-E coming but I have no idea what to expect.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never done any of the 2-c&#039;s.&nbsp; Never done acid either so I&#039;m sure I&#039;m in for an experience.

It will wake you the fuck up and make you want to work. I made some 4mg smarties but I found 4mg to just be way too high to be a nootropic dose. The best dose for 2c-d is 2mg or even 1.5mg. Its the most potent 2cs as far as stimulation goes IMO.

				Have only tried 2C-E, 20mg dose (cant remember exactly) and it was very enjoyable. Stared at granite counter top that blew my mind for a significant amount of time.<br /><br />Only thing was it made my stomach uncomfortable for whole ride? Not hurting, just something was....off with my belly.<br /><br />Not nauseous like psylocibin or intense vomiting like too much alcohol, but whole trip my mid-section just felt weird.<br /><br />Have heard 2C-B has same experience as 2C-E without the awkward-feeling stomach thing?<br /><br />
