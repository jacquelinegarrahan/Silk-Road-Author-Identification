				I hear a lot of stories about undercovers at raves and music festivals, like this one that dressed up as a mummy at a rave on Halloween giving free body massages, and then later was assisting another officer with an arrest, still in his mummy costume.<br /><br />Another undercover actually went as far as to make out with this girl who was friends with some Oxy dealer, went up to her dealer in the club and told him he was cool. They did the deal, 5 minutes later a team of uniformed cops go straight up to the dealer and arrest him, was paid in marked bills.<br /><br />However I&#039;ve never heard of a female undercover, and they sound like they would be dangerously manipulative beings. Especially with us ya know, only able to think with just one of our brains at a time. Could only imagine how easily they could bust you when you&#039;re steering the love train on some molly or shitfaced.
