				I read some thread about bosshog &quot;just being black&quot; and my trip tonight went totally sideways. I fucking HATE racism to my very core.<br /><br />but then the thought popped into my mind that even I, who has a burning hatred for racist behavior, find myself picturing drug users in general. I picture no racial divides with cannabis.no racial lines with coke (no pun intended) all races enjoy opiates and amphetamines. But I find myself wondering about the racial prevalence of psychedelics. I have friends from many races, and religious backgrounds, but for some reason, I can&#039;t get a grip on this. I hope some people here can set me straight, because this single racist thought I can&#039;t shake is giving me the sadness.

				Why is it racist to think that black people don&#039;t often use psychedelics? I doubt many Jewish people play in the NBA does that make me a racist lol. <br /><br />Different cultures seem to use different sorts of drugs. It is very largely cultural and marketing based though. After the Thizz thing caught on the number of black people who used MDMA skyrocketed where as before it was more prevalent in primarily white cultural communities. Genetics may also play a role in which drugs a population uses, drugs effect different people differently and to a substantial degree the different effects a drug produces are caused by genetics. <br /><br />The thing to take away from this is that it is not racist to recognize differences between races, it is racist to judge people for their race instead of their individual achievements. Or even more summarized, collectivism is bad and individualism is good :).&nbsp;

				I hate all oppression, full stop.<br /><br />EVERY race has it supremacists. White, black, Jewish, Muslim, blah di blah. <br /><br />Any race can make a case for it being oppressed and use it to further their own self serving needs.<br /><br />Many people play the &#039;race card&#039; for compensation, better job, whatever.<br /><br />I guess white people are pissed off we cannot play the race card. Some get mad at black people which is silly.<br /><br />Racism is all about dividing us.<br /><br />Drugs unite us. Black, white, red, yellow, we all have good and bad. We all like to get high.<br /><br />I got many white friends, white cracker assed good ole white boys! If we flashed our white asses we would blind any black man. Knowing my luck he would be wearing sunglasses and swing both ways!<br /><br />I hate racism also but lets not get into some white assed guilt trip because whites, Jews, black, Asians and Muslims all colluded to enslave some folk.<br /><br />Sadly, its a case of different cultures being more advanced with weaponry. In the day Africa would have done the same as Europeans and Asians and Arabs. <br /><br />The main argument about slavery is not being prepared enough. Its like the little guy who blows away in a wind but can at least shoot some 6 foot 6 mugger if he needs to.<br /><br />Slavery is basically down to not being armed.<br /><br />Americans are &#039;free&#039; because they are allowed by law to defend against any corrupt government for example.<br /><br />I feel no guilt for slavery because I was not there and like I say, its sad but that was life in the day. Everyone faced pretty bad times. China got starved. they never moan about that. They just progress so that they can equal us in warfare (done) and business (ongoing) <br /><br />I&#039;&#039; m a white guy. But being proud of &#039;my&#039; race - I&#039;m in the human race, and not so proud of it to be honest. Sure we done good but we are still crying about what happened hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />Maybe we should sue the dinaseurs for eating our ancestors?<br /><br />Lawyers will take any case and if enough people sign up then its class action and payouts for emotional distress caused by genes or something.<br /><br />Were I work, we often take the piss out of each other. <br /><br />One black man I work with often gets his dick out and demeans the white race for not having big dicks. I told him it was actually to enable him to suck his own dick and so gift us all with silence.<br /><br />Anyhow bro - racism is wrong.<br /><br />so is a lot of shit in this life!<br /><br />Good post and thanks for raising the issue. Here on SR I think you would vanish faster than a line of coke if you started arguing for the Adolf Hitler &#039;ways&#039;. <br /><br />Usually its &#039;hate the Jews&#039; these days. The return of I ought to say.<br /><br />Any Jews here?<br /><br />Is it true that you all have to kill like 10 Palestinians to get the passport for Israel? <br /><br />Or killing Christians kids to drink the blood?<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />I mean, you hear all sorts of things about different races.<br /><br />Like there is &#039;kosher coke&#039; and if you wear a Jewish hat you get that coke but otherwise you get the other bag of not so good?<br /><br />And some black dealers would call my mate &#039;brother&#039;&nbsp; - but after a while I was the brother also and got good deals! <br /><br />Racial identity matters. I guess people defend their own race but get caught up in the old superiority thing.<br /><br />Sadly, even though white people have advanced, there are still some nations which have that superiority thing going on.<br /><br />and they have nukes also.<br /><br />Ah well, may as well get some coke in for the end of the world news deluges.<br /><br />And some kief also. Cheers me up that stuff but too late to smoke it as its a Sativa and I keep awake on that! Stoned as hell but not a sleepy stoned.<br /><br />So check out the photo of kief grown by white and black farmers, all working as one for some money off people who have more money than they do.<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=529899965c86a26885af8682d0dbbf17.jpg&quot;&gt;The Image&lt;/a&gt;<br /><br />Smoke that and a racist would be going down on black pussy.<br /><br />Black women, are beautiful or can be.<br /><br />The music aint bad either!&nbsp; ;D

				it&#039;s a scientific fact that there&#039;s only one human race. whites got a little mixed up with neanderthals for the better or worse, but that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />having said that, racism is normal. just like nationalism is normal. or sexism. what the fuck? if a turk fucks me over, i&#039;ll call him a fucking turk. and that&#039;s not even a race. and i have turkish friends. who cares. fuck political correctness.
