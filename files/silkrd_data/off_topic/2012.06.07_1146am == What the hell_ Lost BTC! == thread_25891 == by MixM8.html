				Hi guys, fairly new here as well as fairly worried.<br />Last night I finalized a transaction, as well as placed another, and I log on today to see that there has been some sort of rollback: The transaction I finalized last night is waiting on me yet again, and the order I placed is as good as never happened. Last night I had also transferred bitcoins a few times, one of which being a 12 BTC transaction that doesn&#039;t appear in my account anymore! <br />Has anyone else lost BTC since last night? Also is there a plan of recourse from SR? This has dropped my confidence a bit.

				Man, this is getting worse. Are you sure they are lost? I mean, did you check teh origin of the bitcoins, like if it was another address or what, maybe they are back there. We can&#039;t just be losing BTC now, that&#039;s the same as money.<br /><br />Let me know what you find, please.<br /><br />goblin

				Yes me too!<br /><br />I think there has been a problem with Silk Road and they have used a saved database because i can see that the last transactions i did was not took in consideration.<br /><br />I think they have encounter a database problem ...<br /><br />Let&#039;s see.

				yeah there was some kind of a total site-wide database rollback, including with bitcoind.&nbsp; Message SR support and see what they are saying, let them know if you are missing funds, the amount of the transfer and rough timestamp and they should sort you out.

				I did add a coke listing to the basket, paid/put it in Escrow, waited for the vendor to mark it as in transit to FE, as he requires, but the SR went down for maintenance, This morning it showed as still not paid for, and the btc&#039;s were back in my wallet.&nbsp; So nothing lost but still strange.

				Please correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but it shouldn&#039;t be a problem. only the site&#039;s been rolled back; the blockchain has nothing to do with SR, so your money still should be in whatever wallet you put it in. it&#039;s a matter of getting the site to recognize it, and that&#039;s when you&#039;d contact customer service.

I sent SR support a couple to messages about it but they haven&#039;t been read by them yet. I&#039;m not sure if they will need the info from me about what BTC address I sent them to or not but if people are getting their transfers then that would indicate to me that they can fix this with user input.<br /><br />I really hope that is the case because if they have to manually ask each person how many coins they sent where, then verify everything before sending the coins to the persons SR account it will take forever to rectify this situation.<br /><br />I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Also if anyone has any more info about what&#039;s going on and how long it&#039;s going to take to fix it would really ease my mind because like I indicated earlier I have a large amount of money floating in their cyber black hole right now.

				Update to those wondering: A message to SR support prompted the great people over there to form a search for my coins and successfully return them to me!<br />To anyone out there who is still missing BTC, I would recommend messaging staff with some basic info about the transaction. Just once, it took a while to get back to me so it appears they have their hands full.

				I placed an order just after the scheduled maintenance the other night. When I logged on in the morning my order was as if it never happened. However, luckily, my BTC were returned to me. Not sure if related but sounds like it.

				So it&#039;s been over 31 hours since I first messaged SR support about my missing coins and my message hasn&#039;t even been read yet so it obviously hasn&#039;t been responded to.<br /><br />Are you guys who are getting responses from staff and getting your coins back just messaging the regular SR support?&nbsp; <br /><br />Is there an alternative more direct address I can send a PM to work this out?<br /><br />If any of you mods know the magic ninja I need to message to help expedite resolving this issue please PM because I&#039;ve been missing over 170 coins for over 38 hours and I&#039;m getting really stressed out. I&#039;m sure the mods are very busy and I&#039;m sure compared to some people I&#039;m not missing all that much but for me it really is a lot and it would really ease my mind to talk to someone about it specifically. <br /><br />Thank you very much
