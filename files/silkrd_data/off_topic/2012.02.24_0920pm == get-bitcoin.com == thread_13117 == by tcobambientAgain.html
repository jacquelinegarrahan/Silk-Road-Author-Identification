				Um.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; I&#039;ve always used get-bitcoin.com for my bitcoins and it&#039;s always taken about a day to get them into my wallet.&nbsp; Today though, I sent the money and then sent them the confirmation email and the bitcoins were in my wallet within like 15 minutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Very happy.&nbsp;

				Yep, its a great service for a great fee..<br /><br />It&#039;s certainly cheaper than any of the traders we have around here. <br /><br /><br />One thing that really sucks about their service though; for purchases over $1,000 you need government issued photo ID.<br /><br /><br />

				Do multiple orders for totals over $1000. <br /><br />I use them also. But this past Monday it took almost 48 hours to get my coins because MT Gox went down the night prior. But they waived the 5% fee. <br /><br />You can set the max price. I usually just go with market and they&#039;re not too far off. Usually off the day&#039;s high but I haven&#039;t experienced &gt;2-3% off using market. <br /><br />But if they are turning around with 15min or even an hour, then yeah, A limit can be set without worry of the market going over. <br /><br />You can&#039;t beat their 5% fee.

				I&#039;ve used them again. I never do $1000 at one time because that leads to delays (as I learned the hard way). I stay at $500 or less per account/bitcoin address. The turn around time has been 30mins all the way up to 16 hours when things are running normal. When they have an issue, it can take 48+ hours for them to send your BTC. <br /><br />But they have always come true. I&#039;ll give them that, But they seriously need to up their game. They need better communications and better turn around tikes.
