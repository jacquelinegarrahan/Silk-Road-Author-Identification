				It&#039;s a festering blister and undesired effect of TOR being anonymous.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think that law enforcement is focusing more on cracking down on those sites than spending time on SR.&nbsp; I do take small comforts that groups choose to continually DDOS them though.

				I came across my first CP site by accident yesterday while exploring the Onion. Goddamn those people are scary. I think the only way, and it has worked in the past, is for LE to try and track victims from tracing scant evidence in images. Unlike most RL criminals these kiddie fiddlers usually seem to be intelligent clever people, so they get away with it. And f*ck co-existing with them I want t see them burnt, preferably alive. I have children.

				You have a good point there. It does however sicken me to think there&#039;s people out there getting of on CP. This has always been the case though, I guess the darkweb just enabled them to host CP more securely. <br /><br />My biggest concern is whether the build up of CP on the darkweb is going to draw more attention to onionland. I&#039;d hate for tor to be shut down and for us to lose out over these sickos. We&#039;re buying drugs to put in to our OWN bodies on here. And we&#039;re all intelligent people, we know what doses to take and what is a safe/dangerous combo.

Some US states have different ages of consent, so in some states one could legally fuck a 14-17 year old. <br /><br />There&#039;s some dark shit on Tor. <br /><br />*I don&#039;t like any sort of CP and was not advocating jailbait, just an opinion*<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is the exact reason I stick to SR and SR forums on Tor.

				I think some of the stuff on the Hidden Wiki is blagged. I once saw a link to &#039;Human experiments&#039; on there. Sure, in the world we live in this stuff could indeed happen... But I reckon some things on the Hidden Wiki are there to scare people. Looked at it once, then lost interest.

				See, we have freedom. OUR bodies are using these drugs. No one else is harmed. It&#039;s MY money I use to buy my drugs. CP is at the expense of innocent children. LE who look through these forums should realise we&#039;re all safe, friendly and a tight community. <br /><br />No one here courses any problems, even Mister Dank just makes me laugh, when Lim rips him to shreds, it honestly makes my day! Nothing better then seeing Lim at his best. <br /><br />Great community, I love everybody here... I help people out where I can, and so do others... vlad1m1r even offers people a safer way to get coins. Lims offering pre-ban Drone which has given me a hard on. No one here is getting hurt, we are no problem what so ever.<br /><br />Dear LE, please stop harassing us and get your firearms out and pop every pedo in the head. We are a great community and all the drugs here are clean, if they&#039;re aren&#039;t, we are quickly informed about this. WE are the new generation. We aren&#039;t the problem, the pedo&#039;s are. So please get off here and leave us to it.<br /><br />Damn, I&#039;m in a good mood... but this community has given me so much that I had to speak from my heart then.

What kind of weird fuckers get off on shit like that man? law enforcement should be focusing on that kind of sick stuff, instead of the farmer&#039;s market and silk road.

We enable adults to consciously engage in a largely harmless activity in private - it&#039;s a world apart from behaviour which actively harms innocent children. <br /><br />Naturally viewing such videos doesn&#039;t do any extra harm to that child but as long as people think there&#039;s a demand for such material they&#039;re going to keep on uploading it, which encourages people to keep hurting kids ; the best we can do as Sollemnis says is vote with our feet and choose not to visit the Hidden Wiki.<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah exactly. On a sort of semi-related note it really pisses me off when people bring things that actively hurt others and try and sell/discuss them on here. Example of this being that TWAT that decided it was a good idea to kidnap someone for BTC. I dunno if you saw the post I put just before I locked the thread Vlad but I blasted that cunt.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Lim,<br /><br />Yes I did indeed see you blast that cunt as you colourfully put it, and very well deserved too!<br /><br />The question in itself was a legitimate one as I think it&#039;s important to talk about the limitations of the Bitcoin network, even if only to prevent scaremongers from trying to say that cryptocurrencies are the province of kidnappers and Terrorists.<br /><br />I have about 4 years experience &quot;cooking the books&quot; now and I know you have many more and I cannot think of any way an individual could both hide a million dollars in the block chain and withdraw any meaningful amount... also since a hostage exchange is a one time thing there&#039;s no real way a victim&#039;s family are going to pay in installments!<br /><br />Frankly I think if the poster tries something like this laundering the ransom money would be the least of his worries anyway! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting you say that because I think the BTC network is actually far more diverse than people really appreciate and I think this will actually only be realised when it comes to the time when more BTC will have to be put in circulation. <br /><br />Also coincidentally for a bit of fun I did a basic structure for £1M of BTC and then developed it into something calculated to have around a 90% chance of succeeding and it would force the prices up of the BTC by 10-20p (most of the models I did hit 14.5p increase). Was quite an interesting challenge. :)<br /><br />That&#039;s cool, I don&#039;t have many more years on you than that to be fair, I think (from what is all based on guesses) I have worked with a more diverse range of methods than yourself and dealt with larger sums. <br /><br />For example can you do stuff like offshore property double-sells, commodity flips, high-end value fraud and things like that? Also do you work with money that has already been placed or have you set up structures that can place funds without suspicion?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks Lim,<br /><br />I was actually reading on The Bitcoin Trader that this is a potential avenue of attack by LE i.e using vast sums to force down the price of the Bitcoin only to cause it to shoot up again but apparently the effect of this is becoming more negligible as time goes on. As memory serves there&#039;s an upper limit of 20 Million Bitcoins which are being created at a steady rate so any ripples would have to be rather shallow in the nature of things!<br /><br />I&#039;m familiar with commodity flips but I simply haven&#039;t had the need to trade in property and securities to the extent you do as I only need to conceal my Bitcoin purchases for the sake of my clients. Now of course things are looking up and I have registered a small &quot;financial services&quot; in the BVI, Memorandum and Articles are in the post as we speak(!) there&#039;s no requirement for accounts in the other offshore jurisdictions I&#039;ve found to be opened by a company incorporated in that territory so I might quietly shelve plans for the account in Belize ; perhaps we should discuss more specifics over PM? <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to sound overly paranoid but at the very least your savvy is worth the consultation fees! :-)<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah I wanted to discuss Belize with you, it&#039;s not that preferable as an offshore jurisdiction. PM me whenever you want mate, will be good to compare notes,

				i&#039;m not reading 3 pages of shit on CP, just wanted to give my opinion - it&#039;s fucking WRONG. those cunts should be tied up and let the poor fuckers they abused, once old enough, beat the living shit out of them with any tools or weapons they choose. <br /><br />i&#039;m all for pro-choice but as soon as you start hurting others you cross the line. CP is a sexual preference, their brain is wired wrong, there&#039;s no way you can get them to think differently, so they should be put out of their misery before they get chance to act on it, or if they&#039;ve already acted on it, in as much pain as humanly possible.<br /><br />you can&#039;t bundle 15 year olds shagging other 15 year olds into this group - if you are both the same sort of age and consenting it&#039;s not even in the same league<br />

				Good, maybe it will save some harmless dumb fuck from downloading a few pictures off of limewire out of curiosity and getting his ass vanned by the feds and labeled a sex offender for life because of it. Not to mention that no information should be censored. Not to mention that for child pornography images to exist, the molestation must have already taken place, it isn&#039;t like you can molest children though the Tor network. Plus law enforcement still find people who use Tor to upload original material, photographic forensics and other techniques. So the people actually producing CP are in many cases not being saved by Tor, and the people who view it are exactly the type of people that Tor should be protecting.&nbsp;

				To all of the people in this thread who admit to having seen CP, do you realize how lucky you are that you were on Tor or I2P or Freenet when you saw it? There are countless people just like you who saw CP on Limewire or Kazaa even only one time and they are entirely fucked because of it. I also find it hard to believe that you accidentally stumbled on CP on Tor, the shit is usually behind several disclaimers that you would have to click past, unless you somehow got directed to such a site past all of the disclaimers and didn&#039;t know what CP or JB meant on an image board, or somehow got a direct link to CP that didn&#039;t describe what the link was, which I can&#039;t remember ever having seen.&nbsp; I have NEVER stumbled on CP or JB on Tor. Maybe it is more in your face now than it used to be, it has been quite a while since I traveled around general onion space, but it used to be very well separated from everything else. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">what do i need to look for to avoid it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />look for the disclaimers that say ---WARNING--- UNDERAGE CONTENT, and failing to notice those keep an eye out for the multiple paragraph warnings describing the security measures you should be taking to view very illegal underage content, failing that try not to click on links to sites that are named Child Porn Archive, failing that avoid clicking on links that are named either CP or JB. Those little hints generally mean that CP is in the general direction that you are traveling, somewhere in the distance.&nbsp;

Some US states have different ages of consent, so in some states one could legally fuck a 14-17 year old. <br /><br />There&#039;s some dark shit on Tor. <br /><br />*I don&#039;t like any sort of CP and was not advocating jailbait, just an opinion*<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />whew I thought you were going to forgo the mandatory disclaimer but you just put it at the end

They&#039;ve always been one door over, which is why CP often find themselves being hacked, shut down, or generally harassed by various hackers and scenes. I remember 10+ years ago there were public listings of CP IRC channels and IP&#039;s to encourage attacks. <br /><br />The whole drug market is a relatively new scene and is bringing a whole lot more attention to the underground than ever before, which has been mainly the hacking scene, the carders scene and CP. Unless you seek them out you shouldn&#039;t have any trouble, they aren&#039;t looking to be found.

				Why would people want to put kiddie porn on the sweet vidalia? That&#039;s what I call fucking up a good thing. Personally I may not have even been a member to even post here but from what I gather, that kinda shit is what the SR is against. Personally what people do to get off is their business, but don&#039;t fuck up a good thing cause you can&#039;t get your rocks off to a 19 year old teen slut you could probably pick up in a bar(some bars where I live allow 19 year olds) with a cheezy pickup line and a couple of well placed lies in less time it would take to find and download KIDDIE PORN, much less pay for it. Hell the 19 year olds come to the bar drunk and you can&#039;t buy them shit. Not to mention if you go to jail for that, you&#039;ll be getting it balls deep from a silverback gorilla for at least 10 years. Hell if your that fucking perverted get a fatty, we call them slump buster&#039;s, and get some jaw. You get off and she knows your not going to take her out tomorrow night.

				Km, pedophiles pose a significant dilemma. I acknowledge that it is their innate sexual preference just as homo and hetero sexualities are not choices.

Giving them cp is not proper treatment for sooooooo many reasons. It&nbsp; feeds a sordid industry of child rape and the pedophiles desire to ASS FUCK children.

				It is pointless to argue with many of you guys , this subject shuts down your brains and makes you incapable of higher thought. Your cognitive processes become entirely dominated by emotion. You can&#039;t even make a distinction between viewing something and participating in something.Your arguments against the right to view CP are all about child molestation, like the two things are equal somehow. I really think you are mentally incapable of seeing the distinction. It is so weird, but whatever.

And what child pornography industry is there? Essentially the entire commercial child pornography industry has been shut down for years. The vast majority of CP distribution consists of groups of people who only know each other by IP address putting shit up on public P2P networks for free, without even any real community aspect to speak of. The rest is anonymous people who don&#039;t even know each other by IP address trading on Freenet and Tor, or pseudonymous forum communities. The producers don&#039;t molest children simply because of the demand for CP, it is stupid to think so. The demand for CP could arguably lead to some production of CP, but it sure as hell does not lead to more child molestation.&nbsp; <br /><br />PS: Even if it does lead to more child molestation, I still think people have the right to view CP. Buying cocaine leads to more murders in Mexico, should you be banned from buying cocaine? What, do you support murder?!?!

				Hm, not really interested in CP, it is a pretty fascinating community with a lot of history though. They are also some of the pioneers of doing highly secured illegal shit online, twenty years ago some of them were using better security than you are today. Jerking off to image of exploited children is definitely not good, not really bad either though. Kind of sick and strange sure, morally it is pretty solidly neutral though. Certainly not something to make a big fuss about, or send someone to jail over. Actually having sexual interaction with children is pretty clearly morally bad, for many definitions of child. Pretty strange you can not see the distinction. Your words actually lessen the badness of child molestation by comparing it to viewing pictures of molested children, even though the two things are not even close to on the same level.

Im a pretty peaceful guy but i would not hesitate to kill any sick fuck who even looks at my kids (or any innocent child) with thoughts of violating them. Comparing child porn to drugs is such an asinine argument its not even funny. Silkroad is about spreading awareness that responsible drug use is not the problem, but the war on drugs is. If cocaine wasnt illegal no one would be dying in mexico. Its not the small time users fault that mexican cartels are brutally murdering each other, its due to the system that is currently n place where violence is a crucial part of the equation to control the illegal drug trade. <br /><br />Silkroad is another step towards a future of legalization and acceptance. It has the power to change the way the world views responsible drug use. Any form of CP only furthers these sick fucks twisted sexual tendencies and furthers leads them to believe its ok or justifiable. Fuck that.<br /><br />I dont believe that its something those sick fucks cant control either, or that they are &quot;born that way&quot; so we should give them a break. Thats bullshit. Its wrong period. They know its wrong, and instead of trying to get better or get help, they continue to violate innocent children. All pedophiles die and burn in hell now.<br /><br />

				Vlad, imagine a content distribution system where it is cryptographically impossible for anyone to know how many people are downloading a particular file. This is called private information retrieval. So, you think that if a pedophile accesses CP via PIR, it is okay? Because it is impossible for the uploader or anyone else to know if anyone requested to download the CP, so the demand for CP in a PIR distribution network can NOT directly lead to more production, as it is impossible for anyone to determine ANY INFORMATION about the demand for CP via analysis such a system.

Of course sexuality is a spectrum and you&#039;ll find many men find young adults or older teenagers attractive (without necessarily acting on those feelings) but a paedophile is defined as someone with a preference for pre-adolescent children.<br /><br />I worked with someone who treated these kind of offenders for over 12 years and his opinion was that they cannot change, although with time some of them had apparently stopped offending (although the majority didn&#039;t!). <br /><br />Worse still, many of them are intelligent and quickly learn to master the language used in by psychologists so can give the illusion of being a reformed sinner without actually feeling any genuine remorse and fully intending to continue harming children.<br /><br />The only certainties are that :<br /><br />- There are no children in prison, so if a paedophile is locked up then they cannot groom, molest or even contact children.<br />- If the paedophile is dead then they cannot harm anyone.<br /><br />It is very important Justice is seen to be done and we don&#039;t allow accusations to replace actual evidence. We also need to take into account the circumstances of a crime e.g a 21 year old man kissing his 15 year old girlfriend doesn&#039;t make me want to form a lynch mob!<br /><br />Nevertheless we do have a duty to protect the most vulnerable in society and if we&#039;re finding that people are faced with urges to molest young children, we should certainly offer therapy in the first instance. If they act on these urges however and this can be proved in a court of law I think we have no choice but to remove the threat they pose to society through execution.<br /><br />Many thanks to everyone who&#039;s commented so far, very interesting topic!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Every last thing about it. Getting off to images of children, or even thinking about it is wrong. You were the one who tried to compare drug use and cp. There is no comparison except that they are both currently illegal. I only responded to this thread because i was disgusted that someone would be trying to defend this shit. There is no argument here and if you truly believe that there is nothing wrong with jerking off to images of children you too can die and burn in hell as well.

If the possibility of determining popularity of material by uploading to non PIR distribution mechanisms exists, then that would only apply to people who are actually uploading content.

This is called private information retrieval. So, you think that if a pedophile accesses CP via PIR, it is okay? Because it is impossible for the uploader or anyone else to know if anyone requested to download the CP, so the demand for CP in a PIR distribution network can NOT directly lead to more production, as it is impossible for anyone to determine ANY INFORMATION about the demand for CP via analysis such a system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />An interesting notion isn&#039;t it? Does anyone know if this is how CP sites work in practice? For example is it possible to leave comments on videos and images even if it&#039;s not possible to know how many people have downloaded them?<br /><br />Do you think it would be also possible to get an idea of the popularity of material you&#039;ve uploaded by seeing it hosted on other sites or would material shared in this way be downloaded centrally?<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am not aware of any CP distribution taking place over PIR, although OFFsystem might qualify for that, I know little about OFFsystem though. I am not saying this is how CP distribution today is done, but I am saying that if your primary issue with CP viewers is that the demand they create leads to production, then that issue would be solved if distribution took place over a PIR system. If the possibility of determining popularity of material by uploading to non PIR distribution mechanisms exists, then that would only apply to people who are actually uploading content. So still, your major gripe with CP is addressed in a world where all CP transfers are done via PIR. And you are left only being able to use your &#039;demand leads to more production, so should be banned&#039; argument against people who upload or download outside of the PIR.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suppose my concern would be that even if you used PIR users would learn of the popularity of their content vicariously by comments left on videos/images or mirroring on other CP sites.<br /><br />I appreciate this is ducking the issue however - let us imagine a system whereby a person could upload such content and have no idea who was watching it, would this then ethically absolve a downloader of any moral responsibility for viewing it?<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind I&#039;d like to take some time to mull this over before responding in full, speak soon!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				Alternatively, you could consider a point in the future where CGI has advanced to a level which lets you generate fully synthetic CP that is indistinguishable from reality. Would you also advocate killing and burning people who want to view such content?

What you bring up are obvious flaws in the system, which while unfortunate, still happens on occasion. So yes I do agree that instances I&#039;ve seen such as when a fourteen year old is registered as a sex offender for being in possession of pornographic material received from his sixteen year old girlfriend, but we&#039;re pretty positive that those defending pedophiles in the recent threads are not fourteen years old.<br /><br />This could all be resolved if those in question would simply agree to disagree and cease their condescending attitudes towards the rest of us, but until that happens we&#039;ll continue this discussion for as long as necessary. &gt;:(

Lets take TOR out of the equation. Ill still continue to voice my opinions with or without the anonymity that tor provides. As a matter of fact i already do on other clearnet forums, but thats another story. Its the sick fuck pedophiles that will cower and hide. They should be more thankful that TOR exists than anyone else because it allows them a place to gather with the other sick twisted scum of the earth. <br /><br />

				before reading kmfkewm&#039;s arguments on viewing CP I would have held the stance that it should be illegal. now i am not convinced, keep up the posting even when the frustration of people who can&#039;t use logic to reason in an argument and/or trolls makes it hard to continue, please :)

				(Disclaimer: I&#039;m not sure if my response here will be inappropriate because I was a victim, so if it is then Limitless please just delete it, no offense will be taken)<br /><br />I find the issue of CP on Onionland difficult and so like others now have to avoid going to places other than SR. <br /><br />My memory of my abuse is horrifically bad. I only know that it actually took place rather than being my imagination/me being mad because I found a single picture of myself being abused...and finding Tor obviously lead me to think &quot;are there more?&quot; Because of this I spent a long, long time wondering whether the CP on Tor could hold the answers for me. Could I talk to these people and figure out why? Could I find more pics of me and figure out who abused me? (No idea who did it at this point, but know a lot of what was done and where) I seriously obsessed about it for weeks...I thought about trawling the pages looking for myself... But ultimately, I had to accept that no good can come from this. And that there&#039;s just ugly fucking people in this world. And even if I did find myself what about the 100,000s of others? <br /><br />I do often run what I&#039;d say to the authorities in my head if they ever arrested me for the little bit of weed and things I buy on SR, especially in relation to the CP on Tor...and frankly, I&#039;d be so pissed off! I like to fantasize in my head that they arrest me and I create a massive media shit storm for them...I smoke a bit of weed to make my life liveable (and it&#039;s like a j a day, not all day every day), I&#039;m successful personally and professionally,&nbsp; and yet you&#039;re focusing your efforts on arresting me when I&#039;m the victim of the people you appear to be ignoring?<br /><br />God, I feel the need to add a postscript to say that I did grow up into a very successful and functioning person. Well, mostly... :)

				Who said that pedos are born this way? where is your proof of it? And how can someone, discussing this sensible theme, say homosexuality is like pedophilie?<br /><br />No way, I never saw someone hurt from a homosexual relationship but CP is always a one way pleasure and will hurt the child. (even when the child will not notice at first) <br /><br />with homosexuality you just want a counterpart to be in love with. Or having sex with someone for pleasure. There are homosexual persons that are pedos, too.<br /><br />So if I am not mistake there is no proof that pedos are born this way. IMHO pedophilie is ALWAYS a mental illness.<br /><br />yeah I know it sounds like this black and white sight thing and there is more grey ... bla bla bla ... but tell this child that commited himself to the sex with an adult, years later what happened and give this (now grown up) human the right to judge it, in a grownup state of their mind. I bet you wouldnt geht hugs for it. <br />Come on this is fucked up. we are talking about children here.<br /><br />

				Aligibbs- Sorry to hear about your situation. I dont wish any bad things on you or anyone else. This world is a fucked up place sometimes. Im not a violent person, it brings me no joy to come here and spew out threats, and I dont want to see anyone go to jail or have their lives ruined. I wish this shit didnt exist. I want a world where no child would have to ever experience anything like you mentioned. That would be my solution if i could make it happen. But i cant, nor can anyone else. The only people who can put a stop to this type of behavior are the ones who commit these actions. <br /><br />What i said in earlier posts regarding violence was aimed at the people who actively participate in the violation of children not to anyone who has ever in their life looked at a picture of a naked child. TBH, my actions are just a defense mechanism because I have no control over these situations. I know people who were sexually abused in their youth and they suffer with it everyday of their life. I honestly would kill someone if they ever tried to violate my children, just like im sure anyone else in this world would do to protect their family. The problem isnt solved by me or anyone else by making threats to anyone though. But, I do not, nor will i ever condone this type of shit though, and i honestly feel that the people who commit these actions deserve to be punished severely and that jail is too good for them. <br /><br /><br /><br />

The mental illness of pedophilia is characterized by extremely delusional thinking. Many pedophiles realize that it is bad to have sex with children, and they entirely avoid it. I do not see them as particularly mentally ill, although they certainly are not normal. However, some pedophiles do not think anything is wrong with pedophilia. They think that children are better off being molested by them, and that there is a conspiracy to keep the act of sexual interaction with children illegal and demonized. Some of them are even more extremely delusional, and think that actually sexually hurting children is an expression of love. They are very convinced that they are the good guys and see themselves as freedom fighters, or mentors/teachers or as helping impoverished children by paying them for sex acts etc, while in reality they are viciously abusing children. I think that when there is this significant of a disconnect from reality, that it is much more characteristic of a mental illness than of a deviant sexual preference. However in some cases it is fairly consistent with psychopathy, so there is probably a distinction to be made between &#039;psychopathic pedophilia&#039; and &#039;delusional pedophilia&#039;.&nbsp; These two sorts of pedophile are the vast majority of actual child molesters but are not even a majority of those who consume child pornography.

Some people argue that exposure to child porn increases the probability that they will develop the mental illness via desensitization and becoming part of a community. However, I firmly believe that even if child porn increases the risk of child molestation that it should not be illegal as not everyone will progress down this path. And a counter argument that has a decent number of scientific studies backing it is that child pornography is a sexual release for all sorts of pedophile, and will lead to reduced child sex abuse as it offers an alternative to actual child molestation.

				Thanks for the nice things people said. I now realize that was probably a gross over share on my part, oops! <br /><br />I can&#039;t remember who asked what question but I&#039;ll try and answer them. <br /><br />It was a printed off picture (as opposed to a professional one) so my assumption was that they were taken digitally and as such someone had probably uploaded it. And my main motivation was just to try and ascertain who took the picture and who was in it (whoever they were knew what the fuck they were doing, or it was at least premeditated,&nbsp; picture is basically evidence free...no identifiable anything!). I&#039;ve pretty much made peace with it, actually. I&#039;ll probably never know, and I&#039;d rather never remember. <br /><br />I never actually looked at any of the CP sites on Tor, I&#039;m not that brave, nor that mentally stable. I do ok, but I&#039;m fairly certain that&#039;d tip me over the edge, or most people, really.<br /><br />And no, I don&#039;t think it&#039;d actually work if I got arrested. But I like to rant at the authorities about it in my head sometimes when under the influence of the odd substance or two...or maybe even out loud...don&#039;t we all?? :)<br />

				I dunno how anyone could stomach to look at it even out of the most morbid curiosity to be honest. I was thinking about this the other day and I although I normally have no sympathy for any LE I do feel sorry for the poor bastards that have to investigate that shit. If I had to deal with that day-in day-out I&#039;d be on the happy pills guaranteed. Couldn&#039;t adjust to that.

				I agree with limitless 100%, in no way shape or form do i ever feel anything for LEO&#039;s , except when it comes to this matter...<br />The act of people doing this, for fun, or for monetary gain, is fucking disgusting, and horrifying to even think a human is capable of such....vile and disturbing acts. <br /><br />To all the pedophiles of the .onion world. GO FUCK YOURSELVES, MUTILATE YOUR GENITALS AND JUMP OFF A FUCKING BRIDGE! This world is better off without scum like this...And i hope every fucking CP site gets shut down here on the .onion<br />( i know they wont, but i can dream can&#039;t i? )<br /><br />Preying on children is wrong, no matter how you think you can justify it. You can say &quot; oh, but im mental, im sick blah blah blah &quot; <br />Its not a fucking sickness, its your own sick fucking sexual desire to look at kids, and i hope that every single one of these bastards is dragged 20 miles by a rope attached to their dicks.

I&#039;m not convinced this is the case as castration has not been shown to reduce this type of sexual offence.<br /><br />The first source I found on Google says as much : http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/frames/252/spalfram.html<br /><br />It would seem in the States there is also a worry that legally it would be Unconstitutional, though in the past challenges of this kind have failed as far as child abusers are concerned (cf. Megan&#039;s Law).<br /><br />It seems to me the only humane solution for the sake of both the paedophile and their potential victims is to either segregate them from society permanently or simply execute them if they&#039;re found guilty of molesting a prepubescent child.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t mean we relax the burden of proof, nor form lynch mobs, nor will we condemn an adult who has sexual relations with a teenager as a matter of course but where there is evidence a person presents this kind of danger to the community it seems to me that execution is the only way society can protect itself.<br /><br />I apologise in advance if this sounds inhumane but there doesn&#039;t seem to be any other viable solution at this stage!<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

You said that you believed that this would abrogate any moral responsibility from the downloader for encouraging the creator of child pornography to continue to upload such material.<br /><br />Just a few points about this:<br /><br />- Are we sure that this is the way material is shared in practice? Are there no comment sections on images or videos? I imagine there would be on image boards? Also wouldn&#039;t it be possible for the people who set up a site like this to monitor visitor traffic to see if there&#039;s an interest for their materials, even if they can&#039;t tell if a specific file has been downloaded?<br /><br />- Does removing this particular obstacle through use of technology necessarily mean that the downloader won&#039;t encourage others by sharing such material themselves with other paedophiles? If so, wouldn&#039;t it make them responsible for encouraging the creation and viewing of such materials anyway?<br /><br />- Does removing this particular moral objection to downloading CP i.e that it encourages the creation of yet more CP necessarily mean that there are no other reasons to find such material objectionable? If you don&#039;t believe the fact that it causes moral outrage for the majority is a good enough reason to make something illegal where should we draw the line? What about hurtcore and snuff pornography and the like?<br /><br />- Does this issue need to be about legalising or criminalising CP across the board? I imagine you&#039;re aware that there are different categories of CP depending on the age of the child and the degree of sexual activity? For instance if a man were caught with a video of intercourse with a six year old girl this would be treated much more severely than a 21 year old man having a picture of his topless 16 year old girlfriend on his phone. <br /><br />As such, can&#039;t we just have faith in the current system where apply our common sense on a case by case basis by outlawing more extreme forms of CP involving young children but dealing leniently with teenagers who share provocative images of themselves? <br /><br /><br />V.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

There are most likely comment sections on all the distribution mechanisms other than Limewire style P2P networks. It is not a site per-se, it is a network. The network would need to host various things other than CP. If it is PIR, nobody will be able to differentiate the interest in CP from the interest in other things on the network. There could be zero interest in the CP, or it could be all CP, nobody can know. Likewise, monitoring traffic will not tell you what is a client is requesting, it could be CP or it could be anything else on the network. <br /><br />Here is the most basic PIR system, and the only way to do it with a single server. There is a website that hosts images. Anyone can upload images. To download any image, you need to download all of the images. If you want image of an apple, you need to download the entire archive of images and then filter it for apples. Now nobody can know which image you were interested in, thus the demand for certain images is perfectly concealed. This is an extremely basic example of PIR but it shows that it is possible and maybe gives you a better idea of what it is. You can do a lot with PIR, don&#039;t be fooled by the simplicity of the example I gave.<br /><br />It is actually kind of ironic that, in the extremely basic PIR example I gave above (everyone downloads everything, then filters it for what they are interested in), you perfectly hide the demand for CP by having a lot more people downloading it than actually want it. So download CP to combat child sex abuse I guess. I just proved that, if demand for CP leads to production, less production will happen if more people download CP ;).&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">- Does removing this particular obstacle through use of technology necessarily mean that the downloader won&#039;t encourage others by sharing such material themselves with other paedophiles?

				I think it should be illegal to download and view CP because of my views on consent. I don&#039;t think people have a right to view images of a child being raped as that child has not consented to the act itself, the production of the image, or the distribution of it. My interpretation of kmfkewm&#039;s position is that he is a consequentialist of some kind or other, so I can see why he takes the position he does. And I agree that a person viewing CP does not have the same consequences as a person producing it. It&#039;s just that I don&#039;t think that the consequences are the most important issue here.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and get my point across with a non-CP example<br />Let&#039;s say you take a photograph of yourself where it looks like you have a double-chin, and decide you don&#039;t want anyone else to see it. I think that you are under no obligation to show it to anyone. I think that if you inform me that you care very strongly about no-one else viewing the image, that you would feel greatly upset if someone else did view the image, and if I respect you as a human being and care about your dignity (which I ought to do), then I have a duty to assist you in preventing others from viewing the image as far as I can. And I think that this has nothing to do with whether or not someone else viewing the image would cause you any harm, or even whether you would ever find out the image had been viewed. I think it is part of a duty I have to respect your humanity; to respect you as a being in your own right, not merely a means to the end of another&#039;s goals.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s say that rather than you taking the photo, someone else takes it, and the photo is of you being violated in the most disgusting way imaginable. I think the argument is the same, but the imperative for me is far stronger.<br /><br />I think the problem with arguing from a position like kmfkewm&#039;s is that the same type of reasoning - consequentialist - leads people to say things like: <br /><br />The production of CP is bad because it harms the children in the images. <br /><br />Which then leads others to make the argument:<br /><br />It does not actually harm the children in some cases; sometimes they are too young to remember.<br /><br />Which then leads into an empirical debate about whether or not abuse is harmful; whether some kinds are more or less harmful than others. Whereas I see it really as a moral debate, where the simple issue is: children are not in a position to offer consent; are defenseless; and should not be used merely as a means to sexual gratification. And I think this applies also to the viewing of the images: they did not consent to the production of the images, so the person who creates them has no right to them, particularly in virtue of the circumstances in which the images were produced. Thus I think no-one has a right to distribute them, and as I think that most victims of abuse, if asked, would say that they do not want the images of their abuse distributed or viewed by anyone, that we have a duty to prevent their distribution and to prevent others from viewing them.<br />&nbsp;

I find it funny that the dude who admitted to checking out CP on Tor is calling someone who never said such a thing captain chomo, if I am captain chomo for saying it should be legal to view CP, what does that make you for admitting that you checked out some CP sites on Tor?

I also don&#039;t think we should have a task force for tracking down the people who view unflattering pictures, or that people should receive the same sentences for viewing those sorts of images as they do for viewing CP. But I think I do find that kind of tabloid journalism disgusting, and the leering consumers disgusting. But my levels of disgust are much higher when it comes to people taking the same attitudes towards CP. So by my logic, yes, I think it is the same sort of thing that is going on. I guess I believe people have a right to their image. So I see it as the same right being violated. But I don&#039;t think that necessitates equal punishment, or means that there is not greater urgency to tackle CP before tabloids. Or that I would even bother to attempt to tackle tabloids - I think that they are bad, but not really enough to move me to action - probably a moral failing on my part, but there is only so much stuff I can give a crap about before I end up being a gibbering tweaky mess, which doesn&#039;t really help anyone.<br /><br />I think I agree with you that there is no such thing as &quot;re-victimization&quot;, but I see the people deriving pleasure from CP images as profiting from the act in the images, and think that should be punished. I guess when I think of someone looking at an image of the holocaust I don&#039;t imagine them to be taking pleasure in it, whereas my understanding is that this is the reason people look at CP. And I guess it&#039;s this that I find abhorrent. So I know there is no chance that the victim will know about the person viewing the picture, but it&#039;s not the harm to the victim I&#039;m concerned about in this case, it&#039;s the gains to the person viewing the image.<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to say that viewing CP is a victimless crime, but still a crime that ought to be punished. It seems to me like a crime against humanity, rather than against particular human beings. But as that sounds to me quasi-religious and ever so slightly insane, I guess it is the storage and distribution I am most concerned with. And the nature of images is that they must be stored somewhere to be viewed, so I guess this is the crime I see the person committing when they view the image. Perhaps if you look over the shoulder of a person viewing CP on their computer you are not committing a crime. Though I think you then have a duty to punish them for having the image on their computer, and if you don&#039;t you have committed some kind of moral failing.<br /><br />Perhaps the difference between the holocaust images and the CP images is that I feel like it is important that images of the holocaust are viewed, because of the historical nature of the event - seeing the outcomes of fascism is an important lesson I think. Seeing the outcomes of an individual&#039;s sexual perversions is perhaps a lesson I don&#039;t think that needs to be learned. I guess that would be the standard response. But maybe more importantly the CP image does not show the outcomes of the act; it doesn&#039;t show the psychological damage to the child. There is no way to capture that in an image. Whereas with holocaust images we see the death which was the outcome of the Nazi ideology. Maybe there is a certain kind of truth that can be seen in images of the holocaust that I don&#039;t think can be fully captured in CP images because of the differences between the nature of crimes that are documented in them. And then also there is this feeling I have the victims of the holocaust would want us to see the images, whereas the victims of pedophiles I imagine would not want us to view the images. So I guess with the holocaust images I assume consent, and with CP I do not. Which is maybe not an assumption I am entitled to. But it&#039;s one I make in the absence of further information.<br />

				If I may summarise it seems that the thrust of the argument in favour of decriminalising CP centres around the fact that the victim may be ignorant that firstly they are being filmed and that others are taking pleasure at their abuse.<br /><br />We have also discussed and agreed it is (theoretically!) possible to download images and videos in such a way that the uploader doesn&#039;t know how many times they have been viewed - although the fact that this doesn&#039;t seem to be the way this works in practice should say something about it.<br /><br />I think I would ask all of you to consider though the fact firstly that the person in question is taking pleasure at seeing an innocent person being harmed - this is what in itself makes child pornography unethical to me, though I accept a paedophile doesn&#039;t need to view CP in order to find these kind of thoughts pleasurable. The fact once again that paedophiles DO in fact view CP rather than solely fantasising should tell us something in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Secondly, a child does not need to be aware that a specific person has viewed images or videos of them to become distressed.

What if someone has a picture of them with a double chin leak out to the internet? Should we have task force for tracking down the people who view it? Should we send them to jail? By your logic it is just as bad to look at an embarrassing photograph of a celebrity that some paparazzi took, as it is to look at CP. I guess we should arrest everyone who reads tabloids and give them sentences equal to the sentences people receive for viewing CP? Anyway I think molestation is bad even if the victim does not remember. They are obviously not able to consent to having sex. However, there is ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE that they will remember someone anonymously viewing their picture! There is a difference between looking at a photograph of the holocaust and being a war criminal! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I agree that there is a difference between looking at a photograph of the holocaust and being a war criminal. I also don&#039;t think we should have a task force for tracking down the people who view unflattering pictures, or that people should receive the same sentences for viewing those sorts of images as they do for viewing CP. But I think I do find that kind of tabloid journalism disgusting, and the leering consumers disgusting. But my levels of disgust are much higher when it comes to people taking the same attitudes towards CP. So by my logic, yes, I think it is the same sort of thing that is going on. I guess I believe people have a right to their image. So I see it as the same right being violated. But I don&#039;t think that necessitates equal punishment, or means that there is not greater urgency to tackle CP before tabloids. Or that I would even bother to attempt to tackle tabloids - I think that they are bad, but not really enough to move me to action - probably a moral failing on my part, but there is only so much stuff I can give a crap about before I end up being a gibbering tweaky mess, which doesn&#039;t really help anyone.<br /><br />I think I agree with you that there is no such thing as &quot;re-victimization&quot;, but I see the people deriving pleasure from CP images as profiting from the act in the images, and think that should be punished. I guess when I think of someone looking at an image of the holocaust I don&#039;t imagine them to be taking pleasure in it, whereas my understanding is that this is the reason people look at CP. And I guess it&#039;s this that I find abhorrent. So I know there is no chance that the victim will know about the person viewing the picture, but it&#039;s not the harm to the victim I&#039;m concerned about in this case, it&#039;s the gains to the person viewing the image.<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to say that viewing CP is a victimless crime, but still a crime that ought to be punished. It seems to me like a crime against humanity, rather than against particular human beings. But as that sounds to me quasi-religious and ever so slightly insane, I guess it is the storage and distribution I am most concerned with. And the nature of images is that they must be stored somewhere to be viewed, so I guess this is the crime I see the person committing when they view the image. Perhaps if you look over the shoulder of a person viewing CP on their computer you are not committing a crime. Though I think you then have a duty to punish them for having the image on their computer, and if you don&#039;t you have committed some kind of moral failing.<br /><br />Perhaps the difference between the holocaust images and the CP images is that I feel like it is important that images of the holocaust are viewed, because of the historical nature of the event - seeing the outcomes of fascism is an important lesson I think. Seeing the outcomes of an individual&#039;s sexual perversions is perhaps a lesson I don&#039;t think that needs to be learned. I guess that would be the standard response. But maybe more importantly the CP image does not show the outcomes of the act; it doesn&#039;t show the psychological damage to the child. There is no way to capture that in an image. Whereas with holocaust images we see the death which was the outcome of the Nazi ideology. Maybe there is a certain kind of truth that can be seen in images of the holocaust that I don&#039;t think can be fully captured in CP images because of the differences between the nature of crimes that are documented in them. And then also there is this feeling I have the victims of the holocaust would want us to see the images, whereas the victims of pedophiles I imagine would not want us to view the images. So I guess with the holocaust images I assume consent, and with CP I do not. Which is maybe not an assumption I am entitled to. But it&#039;s one I make in the absence of further information.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

The thrust of the argument is, looking at pictures causes nobody harm! Banning people from looking at pictures and videos is censorship and censorship is bad, especially bad when you censor things just because you don&#039;t like the people who look at those things entirely separate of any harm being done to anyone. What is so hard to understand about this that so many of you are having so much trouble to understand the argument?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think I would ask all of you to consider though the fact firstly that the person in question is taking pleasure at seeing an innocent person being harmed - this is what in itself makes child pornography unethical to me, though I accept a paedophile doesn&#039;t need to view CP in order to find these kind of thoughts pleasurable. The fact once again that paedophiles DO in fact view CP rather than solely fantasising should tell us something in my humble opinion.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So you think it should be illegal to take pleasure in seeing innocent people being harmed?

There is always the possibility that images are being viewed and that is all that matters to any potential victim, they don&#039;t know or give a fuck about the monthly bandwidth of freedom hosting. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have been doing some (extremely!) cautious googling and managed to find a story of a girl who has been abused and filmed in secret by her own father:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Okay, first of all her father was an enormous asshole. I feel very sorry for her. Secondly, she makes a lot of money every time someone is caught with one of the videos her father took because there are laws that children in CP found on the PC of people arrested are entitled to financial compensation from those people. She is the poster child (poor use of the word maybe?) for using the legal system to collect large amounts of compensation from the people who view the CP she is in. And I am pretty okay with this! I mean, in general I am against copyright law etc, but it is an issue I am somewhat undecided on. I can by some stretch of the imagination see the CP that she is in as being her property, and see that she has the right to restrict access to it as she sees fit and sue people for copyright infringement. That is not anywhere near as absurd as SENDING PEOPLE TO PRISON FOR LOOKING AT PICTURES. CP as a civil matter you can argue to me and have a chance of convincing me, although this largely applies to copyright in general. Convincing me that people should go to prison (ie: criminal , not civil) for looking at pictures will not even happen after hell freezes over. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;They&#039;re dangerous and, even though I don&#039;t know them, they&#039;re continuing to hurt me,&quot; she said.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well if she doesn&#039;t want to be informed every time someone downloads her images / videos I guess she could stop requesting to know about every case where they are found so that she can get compensation from everyone arrested with them. So being given the choice between knowing how popular the videos her father took are and getting court ordered compensation from everyone caught with them, she opted for the later choice. I have no doubt she is not happy about what happened and all the money in the world is not worth it to her, and I really don&#039;t mean to sound even at all cold towards her, but it is a crock of shit that people viewing images are hurting her. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I do appreciate that her awareness of people downloading videos of her is vicarious and she may not know each specific time that a certain person has viewed her being abused but that does not absolve said paedophile from their responsibility not to view such material!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />She knows every time someone is arrested with her CP because they are made to pay compensation to her

The harm that&#039;s done is to the individual themselves, their potential victims and the children in the images who know that there are pictures of them being molested on the internet.<br /><br />Images of poverty, disease and war are simply not the same thing. They are taken, published and viewed for entirely different reasons. <br /><br />I admit there&#039;s an extent to which harmless images might be seen in a certain context. For example a Jihadist poring over diagrams of Big Ben to look for structural weaknesses in order to fly a plane into it can hardly be said to have a harmless mindset although the picture itself is innocuous enough. <br /><br />This said I&#039;d appreciate if we could continue to discuss this in private Kmfkewm as I think it&#039;s safe to say you&#039;ve voiced your thoughts and I&#039;m a little worried about what newer users to the forum might think if they saw established members espousing such controversial opinions.

Had Mr. Vilca actually molested a child, they note, he might well have received a lighter sentence.<br /><br />“To me, a failure to distinguish between people who look at these dirty pictures and people who commit contact offenses lacks the nuance and proportionality I think our law demands,” said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, who highlighted Mr. Vilca’s case on his blog, Sentencing and Law Policy.<br /><br />Sexual offenses involving children enrage most Americans, and lawmakers have not hesitated to impose lengthy prison terms for offenders. In Florida, possession of child pornography is a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Vilca was charged with 454 counts of possession, each count representing one image found on the computer.<br /><br />Steve Maresca, the assistant state attorney in the case, said that in his view, Mr. Vilca “received a sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines.”<br /><br />“Too many people just look at this as a victimless crime, and that’s not true,” he said. “These children are victimized, and when the images are shown over and over again, they’re victimized over and over again.”<br /><br />But Lee Hollander, Mr. Vilca’s lawyer, called the sentence ridiculous.<br /><br />“Daniel had nothing to do with the original victimization of these people; there is no evidence that he’s ever touched anybody improperly, adult or minor; and life in prison for looking at images, even child images, is beyond comprehension,” he said.<br /><br />Mr. Hollander said Mr. Vilca had consistently said he did not know the images were on his computer. He refused a plea bargain of 20 years in prison, after which the state attorney increased the charges. The sentence will be appealed, Mr. Hollander said.<br /><br />Troy K. Stabenow, an assistant federal public defender in Missouri’s Western District, noted that most people assume that someone who looks at child pornography is also a child molester or will become a child molester, a view often mirrored by judges.<br /><br />But a growing body of scientific research shows that this is not the case, he said. Many passive viewers of child pornography never molest children, and not all child molesters have a penchant for pornography.<br /><br />“I’m not suggesting that someone who looks at child pornography should just walk,” he said. “But we ought to punish people for what they do, not for our fear.”<br /><br />State and federal laws, which generally increase penalties based on the number of pornographic images, reflect the idea that acquiring child pornography requires extensive time and effort and thus is a measure of a defendant’s involvement and interest. But with the rise of the Internet, it is possible to download hundreds of images in a matter of minutes, making the size of a stash a less than reliable indicator, Mr. Stabenow and other criminal justice experts said. It is now a rare case that does not involve the possession of hundreds, or even thousands, of images.<br /><br />As a result, many federal judges have issued sentences lower than those called for by federal guidelines, which add months for multiple images and other aggravating factors. And even when such sentencing enhancements are enforced, the sentences — which can sometimes be 18 or 20 years — are often well below what Mr. Vilca received. The federal guidelines, for example, recommend a minimum of 57 to 71 months in prison for possession of 600 or more images of very young children.<br /><br />Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who is now a law professor at the University of Utah, said there was no question that “consumers of child pornography drive the market for the production of child pornography, and without people to consume this stuff there wouldn’t be nearly as many children being sexually abused.”<br /><br />Mr. Cassell is involved in efforts to get restitution for victims of child pornography, and has filed a petition in one case with the Supreme Court. But he said that while he was not familiar with Mr. Vilca’s case and did not know what other facts might be involved, “in the abstract, a life sentence for the crime of solely possessing child pornography would seem to be excessive.”<br /><br />“A life sentence is what we give first-degree murderers,” he said, “and possession of child pornography is not the equivalent of first-degree murder.”<br />A version of this article appeared in print on November 5, 2011, on page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Life Sentence for Possession of Child Pornography Spurs Debate Over Severity.<br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow hundreds of images he is lucky to have gotten so many a lot of people are busted after only downloading a dozen images from public P2P networks. Some are even raided after a single image! Life sentence for CP is pretty easy to get in some places, since every image is a completely different charge if the prosecutor wants it to be. Even if you only get one year per image you are pretty fucked if they charge you with 100 counts of possession of CP for loading a single page with 100 images on it. Seems sort of strange that just clicking on one link one time can give you a life sentence, I wonder how many links vinny clicked on, it sounds like at least two. <br /><br />These law enforcement / &#039;justice&#039; people live in their own world of propaganda that they inflict upon themselves. They are just as disconnected from reality as pedophiles who think it is good for children to have sex. They live in a fantasy.

				I think one of the main issues is that everyone thinks that they are somehow special or unique. Several people in this thread say that they have been to CP forums / image boards, many of them use what they saw as the starting point for their tirades about how people who go to CP forums / image boards are sick fucks who deserve death and/or jail. They seemingly fail to recognize that they themselves are members of the set of people that they are condemning to death and/or jail, by virtue of having gone to CP forums / image boards. But they do not see themselves as deserving death and/or jail time for some reason. So immediately we can see that these people are hypocrites who do not really believe that people should go to jail and/or be put to death for viewing CP forums / image boards, or else they would be turning themselves into the police and / or killing themselves. <br /><br />Perhaps they think that it should be legal to view CP unless you enjoy doing so. This would be an entirely unenforceable law though, unless we get mind reading devices. So, them not enjoying CP would not make them exempt from being punished for viewing CP in a sane world. Also, CP will essentially be legalized if the police need proof that someone jacked off while looking at CP (vinnys argument for why it was okay that he looked at CP, after all he didn&#039;t jack off to it !!). I can not conceive of a scenario in which it would be sane to say that everyone other than vinny (or any other individual... or subset of individuals, such as those who do not jack off to CP) should be put to death and or go to jail if they view CP. <br /><br />If the act of viewing CP causes a magical revictimization to occur, then vinny is guilty of revictimizing the children who he saw naked in a bathtub and should be punished for it, regardless of if he jacked off or enjoyed it or not (after all, it is the act of viewing CP that causes the revictimization to occur. Some argue that revictimization only occurs if the viewer enjoys the CP, to make an exception for law enforcement, but as law enforcement would not be able to determine if vinny or anyone else enjoyed seeing CP or not, they would need to either arrest everyone other than law enforcement who MAY have enjoyed CP or they would need to arrest nobody who views CP as they MAY NOT have enjoyed it). <br /><br />The same is true for the demand for CP causing supply. Vinny obviously had some demand for CP, or he would not have clicked through the layers of disclaimers on the path to CP, and also he apparently clicked on several links as he says he saw jailbait in addition to children in bathtubs. Thus, vinny caused the bandwidth of a CP server to slightly spike, and made a record of some anonymous person requesting to load a CP site. So if the demand for CP leads to supply, vinnys actions will lead to a child being molested, and he should be punished for this. Also, if we believe the lie that 55% of people who view child pornography go on to molest children, we can conclude that vinny now has a 55% chance of molesting a child himself.<br /><br />I personally think that vinny, and the other various posters who talked about how the pedophiles on the disgusting CP sites that they were browsing should be put to death, should not be punished for what they did. So I establish here that not everybody should be punished for viewing CP. Now, I think that rules should apply equal to pretty much everyone. If Vinny and the others should not be punished for what they did it strongly implies that what they did did not violate the rights of anyone. After all, we punish people who violate the rights of others, for example thieves. Now, we do not make a distinction between a thief who steals for no particular reason and a thief who steals for personal gain. We recognize that stealing is bad, regardless of the reasons for it. Life is almost always this way, things that are bad are generally always bad and things that are not bad are generally never bad. So if it is not bad for Vinny to have looked at CP, and he did not violate anyones rights in doing so, then it is this way regardless of his motivation for looking at CP. Thus, I must conclude that even if a pedophile enjoys looking at CP, it is no more wrong for them to look at CP than it is for Vinny to. After all, if a thief steals for no reason he is no less guilty of theft than a thief who steals for personal gain. Thus, I conclude that nobody should be punished for viewing child pornography, and if vinny disagrees with me then it is only logical for him to admit that he should be punished for viewing CP.

				Since most points seem to have been covered, I will just bring one rebuttal point regarding the issue of freedom. Governments have always struggled to find the line between permitting personal and individual freedom and protecting the common good. Sometimes government may believe that the common good infringes on those personal freedoms, such as with child pornography, and a government withholds that personal freedom pursuant to that belief. This is a point of contention as not everyone sees it that way. Some believe individual freedom is the more important, and that as a community we must sacrifice some common good to preserve individual liberty. My thought is that each individual has both a personal identity and an identity as part of the larger society which I will call collective freedom. Each individual must actively preserve their own individual freedom as a matter of duty. However, when a particular individual freedom becomes intertwined with others&#039; individual freedom, it becomes chiefly a matter of collective freedom. The right to view images is an individual freedom which should not be curbed. However, the right to view images of under matured children in acts which may psychologically or physically damage these children, is a collective freedom. In other words, a man is exercising individual freedom if he is viewing images that were not detrimental to another person&#039;s individual freedom. Children are protected by law because the collective wisdom from scientists, parents, psychologists and lawmakers is such that under mature people have not developed the tools necessary to compete and interact with adults. Once they do, they can navigate our social world and make the choice to be involved in pornography. Until then, it is a damaging act of coercion and fear. In that regard, the answer to the question posed in this thread is an emphatic no.

This figure establishes some limitations to sexual contacts with children older than 14 and younger than 18 years old.

				The age of the child shouldn&#039;t factor in. Each culture and society has a different method of child rearing that makes a kid mindful and mature at separate ages. Furthermore, it makes kids able to handle sexual situations properly at different ages. Maybe cultures with lower ages of consent socialize their children to handle sex earlier. USA always trips about sex so the age of consent is 16 to 18 varying by state. Doesn&#039;t mean one standard should be applied to another. If it&#039;s right somewhere it doesn&#039;t mean it is right in another culture and state. Thank you.

But OMGZ of course it is a special case for them, because they didn&#039;t jack off to it and it was only that one time and only for a minute and they only clicked a few links and and and fuck you kmfkewm you are a dirty pedophile and I hope all pedophiles like you die a painful death and burn in hell! These people would be quick to condemn someone to death for doing exactly what they did, if the someone else were ever to be busted and a nice news article posted along the lines of &quot;Pedophile busted visiting CP site on Tor!&quot;, and they would laugh at his claims of not jacking off, only doing it one time, etc and call for him to be castrated and shot in the back of the head.&nbsp; Scary as it is to think that humans would want to do that to someone for looking at a picture, the more scary thing is that they can not see themselves in that situation when the only thing preventing it from happening to them is the network that they are condemning for supporting pedophiles. <br /><br />Here is a little hint. If you think&nbsp; &quot;looking at CP is bad and should be illegal&quot; and &quot;child molestation is bad and should be illegal&quot; and also think saying &quot;I went to a CP site, but only once, and I only clicked a few links, and I didn&#039;t jack off or enjoy it, and it was only for a minute before I got the fuck out of there!&quot; makes the action of looking at CP morally justifiable, but saying &quot;I molested a child, but only once, and I only touched them a few times, and I didn&#039;t cum or enjoy it, and it was only for a minute before I got the fuck out of there!&quot; doesn&#039;t make molestation morally justifiable, then maybe you need to reconsider some of your positions (I will let you pick!), because there appears to be some inconsistency in your sense of morality.

				This problem exists all over the place; the fact that Tor is used to help distribute CP is not a negative consequence of the technology, it is a negative consequence of freedom itself.&nbsp; We all agree that people should be free from invasions of privacy by default, but we can&#039;t expect that everyone will continue to act so virtuously when the surveillance cameras stop recording.&nbsp; It is the same problem with all technologies - if you are in favour of guns for example, then it is an unfortunate consequence that you will have higher rates of gun crime.&nbsp; If you are in favour of computers, then you will have higher rates of intellectual property infringement.&nbsp; If you are in favour of any technology, it can be used for either good or nefarious ends - the choice belongs to the user only.<br /><br />It is a sorry consequence that by giving citizens greater freedoms, you must give those same freedoms to those who would use them for less than reputable ends.. but that is life.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am going to be starting a weekly live web-cast really soon called &quot;Loving the Kiddie Lover&#039;s Back&quot; where I get pedo&#039;s to dress up like the cute little kids they like to molest... force feed them endless cock and finish with a gang bang anal raping scene that will leave them crippled for life.

Maybe in the early 2000s that was true to an extent, some softcore studios in Eastern Europe were making a few million dollars for selling naked pictures of several thousand kids. But they were all shut down. A year or two ago every single one of the for profit CP sites that were known to the united states law enforcement community were shut down. If anyone is still actually making profit from CP, it would be producers in limited membership underground networks.<br /><br />Today the majority of damage from the demand for CP comes from a distribution structure that requires participants to submit group unique material every X period of time, or have their membership revoked. This is bad as these groups quickly exhaust the supply of non-original material, and effectively start revoking the membership of those who do not molest children to meet the requirements of maintaining membership and furthering their group collection. This is very likely to encourage their members to start molesting children once they are incapable of finding premade CP that is not part of the group collection.<br /><br />The funny thing is that if CP possession were legal, but not paying for it or producing it....both of these distribution structures would crumble (well, for financial profit is already essentially mythical in modern times).

The history of the online CP scene is fascinating and has many similarities to the online drug scene. In fact, the most advanced groups in their community have generally been some steps ahead of us, there were massive open to the public CP trading sites on Tor several years prior to the drug scene reaching that level of publicity and security.

Let&#039;s see, fuck the studies, fuck knowing anything about it, immediately jump to conclusions based on no knowledge and active denial of science. Sounds like you will have the best ideas regarding how to deal with CP. I am somewhat of an expert regarding the distribution of CP and structure of CP trafficking networks, but it is from study of distribution group countermeasures and the feds measures against them, not jacking off to kids on VHS :). I also know a lot about various credit card fraud groups / techniques / history , hacker groups / techniques / history, drug trafficking groups / techniques / history, militant groups / techniques / history, terrorist groups / techniques / history, various extremist groups / techniques / history, activist groups / techniques / history, arms smuggling groups / techniques / history.....hell I could even hold my own in a conversation about jewelry thieves groups / techniques / history and a little bit about gem smugglers.

This would be an entirely unenforceable law though, unless we get mind reading devices. So, them not enjoying CP would not make them exempt from being punished for viewing CP in a sane world. Also, CP will essentially be legalized if the police need proof that someone jacked off while looking at CP (vinnys argument for why it was okay that he looked at CP, after all he didn&#039;t jack off to it !!). I can not conceive of a scenario in which it would be sane to say that everyone other than vinny (or any other individual... or subset of individuals, such as those who do not jack off to CP) should be put to death and or go to jail if they view CP. <br /><br />If the act of viewing CP causes a magical revictimization to occur, then vinny is guilty of revictimizing the children who he saw naked in a bathtub and should be punished for it, regardless of if he jacked off or enjoyed it or not (after all, it is the act of viewing CP that causes the revictimization to occur. Some argue that revictimization only occurs if the viewer enjoys the CP, to make an exception for law enforcement, but as law enforcement would not be able to determine if vinny or anyone else enjoyed seeing CP or not, they would need to either arrest everyone other than law enforcement who MAY have enjoyed CP or they would need to arrest nobody who views CP as they MAY NOT have enjoyed it). <br /><br />The same is true for the demand for CP causing supply. Vinny obviously had some demand for CP, or he would not have clicked through the layers of disclaimers on the path to CP, and also he apparently clicked on several links as he says he saw jailbait in addition to children in bathtubs. Thus, vinny caused the bandwidth of a CP server to slightly spike, and made a record of some anonymous person requesting to load a CP site. So if the demand for CP leads to supply, vinnys actions will lead to a child being molested, and he should be punished for this. Also, if we believe the lie that 55% of people who view child pornography go on to molest children, we can conclude that vinny now has a 55% chance of molesting a child himself.<br /><br />I personally think that vinny, and the other various posters who talked about how the pedophiles on the disgusting CP sites that they were browsing should be put to death, should not be punished for what they did. So I establish here that not everybody should be punished for viewing CP. Now, I think that rules should apply equal to pretty much everyone. If Vinny and the others should not be punished for what they did it strongly implies that what they did did not violate the rights of anyone. After all, we punish people who violate the rights of others, for example thieves. Now, we do not make a distinction between a thief who steals for no particular reason and a thief who steals for personal gain. We recognize that stealing is bad, regardless of the reasons for it. Life is almost always this way, things that are bad are generally always bad and things that are not bad are generally never bad. So if it is not bad for Vinny to have looked at CP, and he did not violate anyones rights in doing so, then it is this way regardless of his motivation for looking at CP. Thus, I must conclude that even if a pedophile enjoys looking at CP, it is no more wrong for them to look at CP than it is for Vinny to. After all, if a thief steals for no reason he is no less guilty of theft than a thief who steals for personal gain. Thus, I conclude that nobody should be punished for viewing child pornography, and if vinny disagrees with me then it is only logical for him to admit that he should be punished for viewing CP.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not really kept up with this thread since I last posted, so sorry for going back so far, and it looks like the bit I&#039;ve quoted has some relevance to my view.<br /><br />So I think I do have a problem with people viewing CP images - but any of us who are advocating punishing people for viewing CP get put in the position where whoever is administering the punishment presumably has to view the images to compile the evidence. So, I appeal to the fact that these people are not viewing the images with the same intentions as pedophiles - and I think that a person&#039;s intentions are morally relevant, although I agree that working out what a person&#039;s intentions are is a (possibly intractable) problem. So when it comes to actually punishing people for viewing images there is a problem of how to prove a case. I guess &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; is ok for me, but I suppose this can lead to wrongful convictions. Would I prefer no convictions to some correct and some incorrect decisions? I&#039;m not sure, depends on the severity of punishment - but I think I lean towards the side of trusting the jury. Though I agree the punishment should not be of the severity of punishments for murder, or even the severity of the punishment for carrying out the acts in the images. Really I&#039;m most interested in the moral rather than the legal side of things, though obviously the two are intertwined and it is a lot easier to make a moral case and then just ignore all the problems of implementation. I guess I don&#039;t accept that the law is unenforceable, I think that it is imperfectly enforceable, and I am not entirely uncomfortable with imperfectly enforced law.<br /><br />More strongly, I have a problem with the storage and distribution of images. I think that storing and distributing CP images does violate the rights of the person in the photo, as I think that they have a right not to have people see images of them being abused. So I guess I think that when vinny accesses CP images, if he does so in a way that leads them to be stored on his computer for a period of time, then he has done something criminal and should be punished for it. I think the distinction I would is not between stealing for personal gain/stealing for no reason, but doing something deliberately and doing something by accident - and we do make a distinction between murder, manslaughter and so on. So I agree that a person who has accidentally downloaded CP through limewire or whatever does not deserve the same sort of punishment as someone who is browsing through CP forums past all the warnings and so on. If vinny has been deliberately accessing CP, whether he was doing it for pleasure or out of simple curiosity, I think he should be punished for it, though I do think viewing the images for pleasure is a greater crime. There are cases (such as the fairly high-profile case of the actor Chris Langham) where, as I understand it, people who have previously been abused have accessed CP and made the defense that they had wanted essentially to see into the world of their tormenters or something. I have some sympathy for this defense. I guess I think that each case is different and so sentencing should reflect this - I think there are such things as mitigating and aggravating circumstances.<br /><br />I think I am also of the view that a person has a duty to destroy any CP images that they come across, if it is within their power to do so. So I guess I see the storage of the images as a moral failing in the sense of a failure to fulfill one&#039;s duty. Although I guess there is then an argument to be made that if there is a demand for these images, and people keep destroying the ones already in existence, more are going to be produced to keep up supply. So there is a conflict between what I think is right and what I think is pragmatic. <br /><br />When it comes to people wanking over images of the holocaust, yeah I think that is pretty fucked up. I think I already claimed that I thought holocaust images were of historical import, whereas CP images are not, which is why I don&#039;t think those images ought to be destroyed; why I think they ought to be preserved. I do have a problem with people wanking to images of the holocaust. I don&#039;t think it causes anyone any harm other than the person doing the wanking, but then I think the same is true of someone wanking to CP images. I don&#039;t think viewing the image causes anyone any harm except the person who views it - unless the victim in the image is aware of it. But I think in both cases it is an illegitimate source of pleasure; I don&#039;t think people have a right to seek pleasure in that way, indeed I think they have a duty/obligation not to do so out of something like respect for humanity. I guess I think that such acts degrade humanity in a way; they are disrespectful, and I think people deserve to be shown about as much respect from others as they show others. So do I think people should be punished for jacking it to pictures of the holocaust? Yes, probably. How the hell are we going to enforce that? No idea. Do I care? Not really, although I probably should. Another moral failure on my part I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, think this is an interesting debate, would prefer it if people didn&#039;t waste energy on calling kmfkewm a child rapist. CP is certainly a complicated as well as an emotive issue, so it&#039;s good to have a space where I can bounce ideas around and try and work out whether what I think stands up to scrutiny/is insane.<br /><br />One thing I would be interested in is how property/ownership are conceived by agorists. I find the idea of &quot;possession&quot; as a crime to be a bit of a weird one...

There is no data storage going on here, I wipe the discs on my computer a few times a month. What I saw was the hidden wiki for the first time, and clicked on some things. I also clicked on the dead animal fuckers site, the mercenary for hire site, and others. I admitted to the mistake, and it was disturbing to say the least, hence me being overly aggressive in stating CP offenders are fucked in the head, and those advocating CP should open a pedo site once, and see a sad-faced child with a penis coming toward him/her, with a fucked up comment section full of nasty pedophiles getting their rocks off.. <br /><br />Sick bastards. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Every time you open a tab with images you are storing those images in at least your computers volatile memory, most likely traces of them are left on your hard drive as well. The simple fact of the matter is that what you did is not at all different from what a very substantial number of people arrested with CP did to get busted, they saw some fucked up sounding file names on limewire downloaded a few of them out of curiosity, deleted them and then six months later were raided and forensics people recovered the deleted images. The only real difference between you and them is the fact that you used Tor so you will not be raided or have your computer analyzed. When you call for fucked up things to happen to these people, you are calling for fucked up things to happen to yourself. Why do you think it is okay for you to load pedo sites once and admit to your mistake but if someone else does it you literally want their balls? So fucking hypocritical. Opening a pedo site once on the clearnet to see a sad faced child with a penis coming toward him/her will end up with you being ass fucked by Bubba, and you seem to be very happy about this for some reason. I am left to conclude that your secret fantasy is not pedophilia but rather being raped in the ass in prison. <br /><br />Further, as I already said, you can not reasonably claim that an action is bad or good based on the emotional state it creates in the person committing it. Law enforcement are allowed to browse and trade in CP to bust other people browsing and trading in CP, but I can&#039;t recall a law enforcement operation where they molested children to bust other people molesting children. The idea that someone can have an immoral or illegal emotion is fucking absurd, and I immediately write off anyone who thinks this way as being mentally defective. Solely *actions* can be immoral (ie: murder is immoral as an action, not enjoying murdering someone does not make it moral) and solely *actions* should be illegal, and morality and legality should be *universal*. It is insanity to argue that if an action should be considered illegal or not should rely on the emotional state created in the person committing the action.
