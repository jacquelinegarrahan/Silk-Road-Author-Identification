				Hey kids,<br /><br />I have a few mates who use steroids, and we want to share our progress, drugs (what we use), cycles/protocols (how we use), etc in an open yet anonymous way.<br /><br />There are forums on the clearnet that attempt to achieve this, like forums.steroid.com, but they are restricted - you can&#039;t discuss source of drugs (which is important IMO), plus you they block registration from TOR!<br /><br />So I want to start a site with forum for community collaboration. I don&#039;t want any annoying advertisements, unless it&#039;s links to vendors here on Silk Road or similar, who are supplying gear.<br /><br />I am also happy to pay for hosting. I dislike most of the onion hosting providers though. Which leads me to my question - what are people&#039;s thoughts on hosting a reliable .onion website? Would a VPS in Rackspace be sufficient/ok?

Pay with bitcoins or bounce real money through several exchanges. You&#039;d have to find a provider that lets you register over Tor, or a proxy accessed over Tor.<br /><br />It&#039;s easier to get a Freedom Hosting invite and run your forum there. renton sells invites on the market.<br />

Or maybe I&#039;ll just use Rackspace. Or maybe I&#039;ll run my own dedicated server in an abandoned building. Or maybe I won&#039;t do it at all. Who knows, besides me and my cat (who is watching me type this). Or maybe I only own a dog, and now LE is looking for registered cat owners in Denmark. Or am I in South Africa?<br /><br />My question was hypothetical, I wanted to know how the hidden services run, and on what type of setup. And legalities aside, Tor is for anonymous usage as well (we all have our reasons), it&#039;s not just for you criminals on SR.<br /><br />So a VPS solution for a quiet site on the darknet is cool? Any other ideas?

				I have my own hidden service at <br />http://37otxza6ovc3nq3c.onion<br /><br />Using it to host The Onion Wiki, and a few image uploaders but looking to expand on this one via subdomains, as well as offering .onion VPN in the near future in both Dedicated and Shared.<br /><br />A simple forum would be no problem to set up.
