				I&#039;m looking for a country to expat to. I&#039;m in the US and was thinking about Canada until my brother lived there for a while and told me it&#039;s damn near impossible to find a good steak because the socialized healthcare means that Canadian government can dictate what you eat. I&#039;m presently looking at Korea but i don&#039;t like their anti-drug policies(failing a piss test means jail time) other than that it seems ideal. I was wondering if anyone lives in South Korea would elaborate on how it is to live there or anyone who lives outside of the US detailing life in their country(expats are especially welcome).

				If you are a US expatriate you still have to pay some forms of taxes to the us no matter how long you are an expatriate. Please see the wikipedia guidelines about being a US expatriate specifically. Actually, here is an excerpt for you.<br /><br />&quot;There are currently an estimated 5.2 million Americans living outside the United States. The US is the only industrialized country to tax citizens on income earned abroad, even when taxed by their countries of residence, though they are allowed to exclude their first $91,400. Additionally, US law requires expatriates to report any foreign bank accounts exceeding $10,000, with heavy fines for noncompliance. American expatriates have also frequently been denied service at banks and other institutions in their countries of residence, as the US government requires other nations to abide by its banking and financial laws when dealing with its citizens. As a result, hundreds of US expatriates renounce their US citizenship every year.&quot;

				Crazy, was he waaaay up north or something?&nbsp; If you&#039;re in the arctic maybe it&#039;s hard to get a steak.&nbsp; Hell, my city has more than 20 places advertising steak nights where you get a deal off their regular pricing.<br />I can also go to various &quot;crunchy granola&quot; stores to get free-range and/or organic beef.<br /><br />Some places ARE quite bland, they think north americans all want plain potatoes and shit.<br />Sometimes I have to say, &quot;Don&#039;t make that thinking I&#039;m going to complain if it tastes like something, I&#039;m eating Indian food, make it like you were going to eat it yourself.&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve lived in almost every province at one point or another, and there are a lot of highs, and a lot of lows.<br /><br />Calgary has some of the BEST Chinese food in North America.&nbsp; Hell, those assholes invented ginger beef.<br />Toronto is great for Italian and Indian.<br />Kingston Ontario though has the BEST Indian/Pakistani cuisine I&#039;ve ever had.<br />Quebec is good for some pretentious French cooking, and really good jewish deli fare.<br />BC is great for Salmon/crab as well as Japanese/Korean food, and they have the freshest asian vegetables.<br />Lobster and scallops are best on the east coast.<br />There is this super trucker breakfast buffet place in Quebec where you can have almost any breakfast food 24/7 - all the way from granola to turduckin sausages with bacon strips, bacon strips, bacon strips.<br /><br />Youtube Epic Food Time guys... they are Canucks.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If Obama/new president decides to leave the pot states alone, I would seriously consider moving there though.&nbsp; The US can be so much fun.&nbsp; :)
