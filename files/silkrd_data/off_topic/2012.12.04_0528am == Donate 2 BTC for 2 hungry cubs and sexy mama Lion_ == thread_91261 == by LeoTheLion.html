				This is fucking hilarious, A for effort.<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;d consider poaching one of your cubs, a pelt like that will net you a handsome return on your investment. It&#039;s not like you guys don&#039;t already go ape shit for infanticide, so what&#039;s there to lose?! : (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide_(zoology)). <br /><br />

				I&#039;m seriously contemplating giving this guy some coin. This post was a refreshing dose of the kind of playful innocence I&#039;ve come to lose during my years of drug use. <br /><br />I see a lot of my childhood self in Leo, and I hope his dream is fully realized. No 12 year-old should have to live in world without access to IV heroin.
