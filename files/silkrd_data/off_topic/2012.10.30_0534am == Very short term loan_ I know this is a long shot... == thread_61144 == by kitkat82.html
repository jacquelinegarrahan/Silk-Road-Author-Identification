				Hey there.&nbsp; I am wondering if anyone would be willing to front me a small BTC loan?&nbsp; I will be able to pay back either tomorrow or the day after.&nbsp; I had some major family drama and basically had to be the mediator/hand holder all day, now it is too late for me to run out and use bitinstant or anything since I am watching my niece and nephew tonight and they are sound asleep.<br /><br />So if anyone would like to set up a contract I would like 6 BTC, and will pay back as soon as things get straightened out and my niece and nephew can go back to their parent&#039;s house.&nbsp; Hopefully tomorrow, I love them but they are a handful.&nbsp; I just feel kinda sketchy even taking them in the morning to make that type of transaction.

				if you had read what I was talking about , I was saying people who need a loan and have good intentions, [plan on paying it back], get screwed. So don&#039;t comment if you aren&#039;t going to fully read or don&#039;t fully understand the post.

				Hey Fred, i am getting some BTC tomorrow from Captain Mal and will pay you ASAP.&nbsp; I never got that address so if you could please resend it I would appreciate it.<br /><br />Really sorry this happened, I was embarrassed that I didn&#039;t have the money to pay you like I said I would and I was struggling with other life stuff...I ended up taking too many sleeping pills and vicodin and had to get my stomach pumped, and was forced into a rehab/detox.&nbsp; They warned me not to come bnack here, and I have checked a few times and logged out fast because felt guilty about disobeying my &quot;sponsor&quot; .&nbsp; But screw that, I can&#039;t sleep at night sometimes thinking about how you still don&#039;t have the money you lent me on good faith.&nbsp; Really sorry, and I feel even more worthless and pathetic having to admit that my life has turned to this so quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Send me the address and I will pay you what I can, I am planning to get about $80 worth of coin.

				You can all repay Fred by purchasing his top quality bulk MDMA if you&#039;re in the US or Canada. I cannot stress enough how awesome Fred is. His MDMA is the best I have ever done. So if you want to send him some real karma and get yourself something in return, I highly recommend him as a vendor. People like him make the Silk Road a paradise.
