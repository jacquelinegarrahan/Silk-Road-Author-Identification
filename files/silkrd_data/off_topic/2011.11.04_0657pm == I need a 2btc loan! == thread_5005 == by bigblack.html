				I am a vendor on the SR, but new to the forums, I have been hesitant to join due to my paranoia but have been told by customers that I should come here. <br /><br />I need 2btc, I have much more then that in escrow, I also have xanax bars that i will sell for 2$ a piece if anyone is interested, you would have to release escrow early of course, but I can promise you wont regret it and I will probably throw in some extra for your generosity.<br /><br /><br />If you decide that you feel comfortable loaning me 2btc, and getting 3btc in return by tomorrow or the next day just message me or send me the bitcoins directly to my account on SR :bigblack<br /><br /><br />I hope you dont see this as begging, I promise to whomever decides to help that you will be greatly rewarded in the end :) this will not be a gamble or a chance, I am a man of my word. <br /><br />heres my SR account, just message me if you want the xanax and i will make you special listing <br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/36472<br /><br />thank you all for everything, I have seen you guys help out other people before, I just hope im not irritating anyone. <br /><br />much love<br /><br />~bigblack

				Hey, whatever happened to my 2 bitcoins? You did say you would return it and more. I don&#039;t need more, even if you just paid it forward that would be cool but people come on here asking for some extra change all the time and I&#039;m happy to oblige but it&#039;s not really cool to never pay it back.

				When I loan to a vendor I have them put up a $0 listing which I purchase from them and they immediately confirm shipment. It remains this way as somewhat of a &quot;motivator&quot; for them to repay the loan. They&#039;ll end up with a 1/5 if they don&#039;t communicate or repay the loan within a reasonable amount of time as agreed upon prior to sending the bitcoin.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only loaned to a vendor once and it was for 17 I think, much higher than my limit of 3 because he was (and still is) a very successful vendor who would be able to pay me back and that I had the possibility of leaving poor feedback.

				Bigblack paid it back!<br /><br />And it wasn&#039;t about the money madam, it was about keeping this place good, honest and pleasant. I love seeing people doing good things for each other. This is an interesting and cool place and maybe it&#039;s just me but the forums are actually getting a little more pleasant lately. Actually that could just be because I&#039;ve been way to busy to hang out here much :).<br /><br />Any of you ever need anything just let me know.<br /><br />Happy new year all!
