				LOL. <br /><br />They should probably change the name of the section from &quot;Rumor Mill&quot; to &quot;Vendors and their products&quot;<br /><br />Easy to see how someone might get confused. <br /><br /><br />To OP: yes, it&#039;s been up and down.

				So? <br /><br />The conventional understanding of the terms &quot;rumor&quot; and &quot;rumor mill&quot; defies the description.&nbsp; They should rename it to something that is more in line with the description. The OP saw the word rumor and thought this would be the appropriate section. Easy to understand how he drew that conclusion. A simple mistake given the discrepancy between section name and description. Nothing to harsh over. <br /><br /><br />For instance, &quot;product offers&quot; - self explanatory by name alone. Description in line with section title.&nbsp; Same for product requests. <br />

				Wow, I need to apologize.&nbsp; I feel stupid for posting this now, and have even asked a mod to delete/move the topic.&nbsp; I would like to excuse myself and plead to you all that this was not my fault!&nbsp; Haha, I would like to blame TheBudFather!&nbsp; Seriously, I am an intelligent person normally, this is not like me.&nbsp; I was, and currently am again, completely stoned.&nbsp; Actually, this is an understatement.&nbsp; This is not a &#039;plug&#039; (or &#039;shout out&#039; to increase sales/revenue) for TheBudFather, seriously, it is an honest explanation for this situation.&nbsp; :/.&nbsp; I will TRY to refrain from acting like I know something when I am stoned.<br /><br />With that being said, I would also like to point out the noobish error about being so concerned over Tormail.&nbsp; <br />The situation I was experiencing was not due to concern over tormail being compromised, it was because I &quot;needed&quot; an email.&nbsp; Tormail will go down from time to time, it has in the past and is likely to do so again in the future.<br />As long as we assume tormail has been compromised from day one, and utilize the appropriate procedures (pgp mainly), then we should be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once again, I am stupid for posting this thread in said forum.&nbsp; I will try to make better efforts at appropriately placing topics.&nbsp; &nbsp;So to anyone who tried to point this out to me, and I neglected to listen, I am sorry.&nbsp; Especially grahamgreene.&nbsp; Although you came about saying so in a rather harsh format, I directly replied to you and tried to validate my point (wrongly).&nbsp; <br />BenJesuit, changing the name would be an idea.&nbsp; I do not believe it is necessary though.&nbsp; As grahamgreene pointed out, their are descriptions below the forum topic.&nbsp; No matter how you word things, people will find a way to confuse it (i am not saying we are all dumb :p) with something else.&nbsp; In a stoned trance, reading &quot;RUMOR MILL&quot;, flooded ideas about rumors floating around about tormail.&nbsp; Looking back on it, I laugh.&nbsp; Sorry guys :P, hopefully you all do not think too much less of me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hey, at least I am humble (to an extent), and can admit when I am wrong and apologize promptly (i have not been very active on the forums as of late).&nbsp; <br /><br />Hope you are all doing well, and the Site returns to normal functionality soon.&nbsp; I know the vendors want to get to work, the consumers want to make their purchases, and DPR probably wants a break.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna take one myself :)&nbsp; This godbud I just got kicks some major bootyhole :D.<br /><br />Be easy everyone (and not like my mother, that would just be disgusting!)<br /><br />-Roxors

				Tormail should have alternate domains that all point to tormail, like many other e-mail providers.<br /><br />Hope to see an alternative soon also.

				I&#039;m having issues too. This isn&#039;t the first time, I find tormail to be generally unreliable which&nbsp; is a real inconvenience. <br />But I haven&#039;t found another alternative. If anyone has any other suggestions I would love to hear them.
