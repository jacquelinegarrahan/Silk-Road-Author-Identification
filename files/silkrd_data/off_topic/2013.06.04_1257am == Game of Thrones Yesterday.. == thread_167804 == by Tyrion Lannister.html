				I think they did a great job of building up the tension - you just *knew* something wasn&#039;t quite right all the way through the wedding, but when it all happened it was still horribly unexpected and brutal.&nbsp; I literally did that thing where you watch through your fingers.<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad it happened to the characters in my least-favourite storyline in the show. ::)

				As OzFreelancer said, you knew something wasn&#039;t quite right all the way through but i wasn&#039;t quite expecting what happened! I though there may be an attempt to kill them but didn&#039;t realize they would pull it off (although when the door closed and the music changed i realized something really bad was coming)! The stark family have historically had shit luck in this show but i kind of feel the show had centralized on them from the start getting you attached to the characters. Then it just brutally killed them all off (I haven&#039;t read the book but i assume this follows what happened in the book)!! Although there is still the 4 stark children left and john snow off course!<br /><br />Does anyone not think that john snow just riding of without his wildling bird what a bit harsh an unsuspected as well? especially as she seemed to turn on her own for him!!

				I haven&#039;t read the books either, so that episode took me completely by surprise.&nbsp; The whole time I was kind of expecting Robb&#039;s wife to be attacked, but I didn&#039;t think the attack would be successful.&nbsp; When everyone just started getting killed, I was like.... DAFUQ??<br /><br />I was really hoping that this season was building up to an epic battle between Robb and the Lannisters.&nbsp; I hope there is still some good action in the season finale this week.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing there will be quite a few more deaths.

				For anyone who doesn&#039;t know what the controversy is about, this Twitter account is hilarious: https://twitter.com/redweddingtears<br /><br />You&#039;d think they literally killed someone on air.<br /><br />
