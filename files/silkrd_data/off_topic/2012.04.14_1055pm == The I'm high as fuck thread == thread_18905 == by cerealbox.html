				I&#039;m high as fuck. Man, I took some 2c-b expecting a very visual experience and now I&#039;m high on XTC.&nbsp; I&#039;m also fucking trashed on alchyhol. Considering taking mushrooms right now. Wish one of my two best friends weren&#039;t incapacitated so I could talk to them. Instead I&#039;m all social in my room, expecting a more serene experience.

				Shit, itching to eat some shrooms but it&#039;s only been 4 days since my last trip. Also got some DMT but don&#039;t have a proper device to smoke it from and the sandwich method seems kind of wasteful. Oh well, 420 should be interesting. :D

				Does anybody else enjoy just taking threshold doses of their drugs to start they day? It&#039;s magnificent, they make only subtle changes to the day, but it really spices up my life every now and then when I get bored of straight up tripping balls.
