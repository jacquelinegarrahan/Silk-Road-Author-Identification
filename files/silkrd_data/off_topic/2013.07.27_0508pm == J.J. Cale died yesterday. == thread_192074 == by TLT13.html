				I&#039;m sure many of you here are familair with his music. I&#039;m sure many loved it. It&#039;s a shame he passed away, a great artist. A very own kind of music in my opinion.<br /><br />Clearnet, Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-9x6dRPzgM Great documentary here on him. &#039;To Tulsa and back, on tour with J.J. Cale&#039;.

				wow - brings back some memories - i went to one of his concerts in the early fucking 70s, and have a couple of his early albums on a shelf - need to get the audio system back up. JJ Cale and Leon Russell were the only two i&#039;d go to a concert to see (hate crowds).<br /><br />tks for posting

Going to listen to that tomorrow while we trip in honor of him!

				try listen to &quot;Call Me a Breeze&quot; - the version he did with eric clapton, and &quot;After Midnight&quot;, again, the version he did with eric clapton - good tunes to lay back to and smoke a doobie<br /><br />summertime in the evening heading down to the beach, windows down (most cars didn&#039;t have A/C back then (and no we didn&#039;t walk to school barefoot in the snow) with some JJ Cale, Clapton or Leon Russell in the tape deck, passing a doobie - god those were good times. <br /><br />Then came disco (wtf) and alongside it heavy metal (even bigger wtf)

				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-9x6dRPzgM#t=1h20m45s will you believe I was in this part when I read your post? Funny coincidence =) Thanks for the tip though. God I love this music.<br /><br />It&#039;s a goddamn shame gas is so expensive nowadays. I&#039;d do nothing but cruise with CCR, J.J. Cale, Clapton, Stones, Floyd, Zeppelin.

				there was another songwriter/singer, little different vein of music, very unique, almost the bob dylan of JJ Cale&#039;s style, but definitely good stuff to listen to while toking - Leonard Cohen - Bird on a Wire iirc was his first album and the song by the same title was good tune to lay back to<br /><br />there was someone Leon Russell toured with a lot, and for the life of me i can&#039;t remember his name - i&#039;ve got to go thru the stack of albums - he did a couple of &quot;jamming&quot; albums with him<br /><br />if you want to really laugh your ass off, find on youtube or on the web, Cheech &amp; Chong&#039;s first album with a skit about &quot;knock knock .... (Cheech): who&#039;s there?&nbsp; (Chong): Dave, man, it&#039;s me Dave...let me in, the cops are after me&nbsp; &nbsp; (Cheech) Dave? Dave? ..Dave&#039;s not here man.....&nbsp; &nbsp;well you get the idea, i can&#039;t do it justice but the first time you hear it while toking, you&#039;ll laugh your ass off. <br /><br />

				Such a great song writer and so cool, did so much for so many musicians.. Eric Clapton made millions of songs written by J.J.<br />Very sad to lose such a music legend.&nbsp; <br />

				I didn&#039;t know this until I seen this thread. How did this not show up in my news feeds?<br /><br />How weird, I was listening to the JJ Cale Pandora channel on the day he died. Sad to hear this. Another dead hero.
