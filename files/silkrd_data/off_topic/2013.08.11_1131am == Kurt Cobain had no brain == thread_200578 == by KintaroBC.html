				Kurt Cobain is a mediocrity, his fans are mediocrity worshippers. It was an attempt to destroy art and nothing else.<br /><br />Hitler had more artistic integrity, but not much more, Hitler&#039;s boring naturalism was just a polar opposite to Cobain&#039;s subjectivism. Neither were objective, objectivity is about concepts. Hitler is about raw sense data, Cobain is about concepts with no objective referents. Terrible stuff.<br /><br />Go to your Youtube, and listen to Galt Aureus. Now that is art!

				in the end ya.. but thats not the point this man was smart mother fucker even though he was noddin off half the time.<br /><br />documentary i seen everyone that knew him would say he would be ripping cords just playing a song they would say whats that and he said nothing just fucking around. and theyd never hear it again because he was like that he could play made cords he lived with a guitar. like peter doherty and jimi they all had problems but they dosent mean they arent a household name which a bet at least one of them is in almost every house hold in north america. <br /><br />yu dont even know that the cia or his &quot;wife&quot;whatever kate hutson didnt have something to do with it.<br /><br />when they found his body he had like 3 times a heroin OD&nbsp; which would mean he wouldnt even be able to function to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger he was that fucked. look up your facts before you spew bullshit on a free speach forum lol

				Kurt Cobain was very intelligent. He is one of my favorite artists and I like most of his songs, they are deep and truthful, hard to find something like that now adays. Now it is just shit techno stuff that I could go without. <br /><br />There is some good evidence that his wife killed him, but there is no way I will ever know so I just don&#039;t bother thinking about it.<br /><br />

				I knew Kurt and he would have come here and read your post and agreed with you.<br /><br />Because that is the quickest way to deal with you and people like you and Chan Marshall.<br /><br />Sucker MCs drop and haters gonna hate.<br /><br />I challenge anyone with any kind of real guitar chops to go listen to the discography from the beginning and listen to the sounds on the first album.&nbsp; Compare it to ANYTHING contemporary AT THAT TIME of wuss rock and pinche hair metal bitch whinning asshole fuckers.....<br /><br />Tone.<br /><br />Then come back to me and tell me YOUR INFORMED OPINION AGAIN.<br /><br />Am I mad, bro!?!&nbsp; &nbsp;No.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can sit there and listen and know what I am hearing.<br /><br />And before-- &quot;ooo, Cobain fan!&quot;-- if push came to shove I would be forced into a draw between whether Pat Metheny is my favorite musician or Johnny Winter is.&nbsp; I listen to everything.<br /><br />Kurt Cobain had a brain and a set of ears and the discipline to keep a notebook despite everything else in the universe.&nbsp; We know what he did with those tools, and he made more money than many of use will, and has set up his kid for life.<br /><br />Many do far less.<br /><br />Where did you get your information from? Why should anybody think your opinion is worth a great shiny god damn?<br /><br />The difference between mine and yours: I told everybody to go back and listen to again....

				He had too much brains, but his nurture was wrong.That&#039;s why rumor says he was shot at his head...lol ?<br /><br />I once heard he did not want to be a lead singer, this is what he told all his members, a.k.a. the voice of the band.<br />But ppl made him the lead... he hated the stardom...

				I&#039;m not sure.<br /><br />And before anyone gets their panties twisted, I quite like Nirvana and grunge in general. but enjoying a band has nothing to do with the merits of the members.<br /><br />I once got a pretty cool book which was a published collection of his notebooks and drawings etc from different periods of his life. Much of it was just depressed mumbo-jumbo and stereotypical &#039;doomed&#039; youth, introspective, ego based self-pity. Not particularly intelligent as a thought process and definitely does not show the intelligence to monitor and manage his own thought process and emotional state. however, some of it did indeed show an ability to make clever little jokes and cartoon drawings, with obvious understanding of social and psychological trends in other people. Plus, I think he probably saw a lot of how the world really operates compared to a lot of people at the time. Inevitably though, I don&#039;t personally think anyone is very intelligent if they do not have control over their own emotional state.

Many intelligent people in this world have had mental breakdowns or been &quot;in emotional states&quot; as you put it. Jonh Douglas, who started behavioural sience for the FBI to find serial killers and peodophiles who kill is obviously a very intelligent man but suffered a breakdown due to his work. There are many examples&nbsp; ;)

				Cobain fucking rocked. He was the REAL FUCKING DEAL.<br /><br />There are very few actual fucking rock stars. Lots of ponces and posers, dunces and divas, some even with some talent; but very fucking few bona fide rock stars. A cool that eminates and is not faked or calculatedly constructed. Cobain was one of the real fucking deals. Amazing music. Amazing guitar. Amazing voice. Amazing songs. And amazing presence.&nbsp; One of the few living rock stars to match him is Bobbie Gillespie.<br /><br />The topic creator is a fan of Hitler. Which kind of makes sense when you remember he doesn&#039;t like Cobain.<br />

				The man is dead now! Have some respect at least!&nbsp; He accomplished quite a whole lot during his short life! <br /><br />You can&#039;t deny that Nirvana put the seattle music scene back on the map again! and you can&#039;t deny what Nirvana and Kurt Cobain have done for Music in general.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />just have a drink, a smoke, or whatever it is you do. And throw on that &quot;Bleach&quot; album and just jam out!!&nbsp; |<br /><br /><br />Bleach was Nirvana&#039;s best work! <br />
