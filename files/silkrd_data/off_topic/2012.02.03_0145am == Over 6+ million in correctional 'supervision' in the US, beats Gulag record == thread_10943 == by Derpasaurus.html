				http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/02/prisons_in_the.html<br /><br />Congrats Americans you have officially surpassed Stalin for most people incarcerated at the same time in known history.<br />Must be good money in running a private prison with next to free labour. They&#039;re trying to do that here too<br /><br />Was reading Marc Emery&#039;s federal prison blog from Tennessee. There&#039;s a bunch of guy&#039;s in his block who were caught receiving 1-3LBs weed from Oregon and are serving 10 years for it. Be careful!<br />

				It&#039;s awful, isn&#039;t it? Last time I was in county there were 5 people to a 2 man cell, and that&#039;s nothing compared to bigger counties and prisons. Especially prisons that are privatized because they are making SO much money. Our &quot;justice&quot; system is a joke.

				Holy s- that&#039;s pretty sick dude. I knew the US was bad because of the private prisons, but didn&#039;t think it was THAT bad, no wonder they desperatly try to change the law into favor of arresting people for no real reason...(SOPA\PIPA anyone?).

				As unpleasant as prisons are, there is simply no comparison to the experiences of those who went into the Gulags.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and liceridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest. These prisoners have deteriorated to the point of losing any resemblance to human beings. Lacking food . . . they collect orts [refuse] and, according to some prisoners, eat rats and dogs. It was these Siberian camps, devoted either to gold-mining or timber harvesting, that inflicted the greatest toll in the Gulag system. Such camps “can only be described as extermination centres,” according to Leo Kuper. The camp network that came to symbolize the horrors of the Gulag was centered on the Kolyma gold-fields, where “outside work for prisoners was compulsory until the temperature reached −50C and the death rate among miners in the goldfields was estimated at about 30 per cent per annum. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Trivializing the Gulags is a mistake.
