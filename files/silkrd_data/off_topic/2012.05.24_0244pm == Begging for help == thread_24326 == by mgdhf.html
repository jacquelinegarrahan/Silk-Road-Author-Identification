				I&#039;m gonna keep it short, but basically I need someone to lend me some coins (I need about ฿10) but anything will help. I need this money to become a vendor and right now I have about 20$ in cash so I can&#039;t do anything with that, and I can&#039;t sell my product on the street because I have both &quot;criminals&quot; and the police on my ass. And I&#039;ve got all this product that I need to get rid of as I very rarely use drugs myself.. I know this is probably not something that you just ask for, but I just discovered SR and I really need to sell my product ASAP and I&#039;m &quot;just&quot; ฿10 short. If anyone will help me with this you will be payed back within 14days +25% interest.

				In case there is no one willing to lend you the money, I recommend that other infamous Tor marketplace where becoming a seller is free of charge.

				Not prepared to give out 10 btc&#039;s to a person with no history and one post. As ballzinator said i would say the best place to go will be the blackmarket. (http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php)

				I am currently waiting to be approved as a seller on the blackmarket. But It doesn&#039;t seem anywhere near as big as SR, and as I understand it you can&#039;t really transfer btc&#039;s from your blackmarket account to your Sr account?

				Sorry mate but if you can&#039;t even afford the small price it takes to become a vendor, you don&#039;t deserve it. Anyways, if you have police and &quot;criminals&quot; watching you what makes you think it would be easier shipping drugs instead? Do you know the proper precautions you must take in order to securely ship narcotics anonymously? ???

				I have shipped narcotics before, mostly just inside of Europe but also to Canada, so yes, I know what precautions I must take. And with the police watching me, they would arrest me if I sold narcotics to anyone, but for that to happen they must see, with there eyes, or hear, with there ears, the deal being made. And the &quot;Criminals&quot; would hear that I&#039;m slinging dope as soon as I got my first call. And dude, I don&#039;t deserve to be a vendor because I happen to be ฿10 short, and in a kinda tight situation? That doesn&#039;t seem fair

				I&#039;m going to have to call this a great big &quot;Fuck off back to Beggarsville OP&quot; because the only thing you are getting from here is scotch-fucking-mist. <br /><br />If you can&#039;t afford the vendor fee, you can&#039;t afford the product to sell, if you can&#039;t afford the product to sell, you can&#039;t be a vendor.
