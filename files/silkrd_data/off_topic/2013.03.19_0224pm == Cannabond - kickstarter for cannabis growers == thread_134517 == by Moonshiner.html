				---<br />Please be constructive. Maybe this idea is the &quot;next silk road&quot;. Maybe not and I&#039;m just a fool. At least I try to build something new.<br />---<br /><br />Hey guys,<br /><br />Last time (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=109968.msg754757) I wasn&#039;t online for a couple of days so I couldn&#039;t reply for the questions. It was my fault that I didn&#039;t give enough information.<br /><br />I almost finished the coding of a new darknet service: Cannabond.<br /><br />Cannabond is like Kickstarter for Cannabis Growers.<br /><br />The idea is simple. Trusted growers can start crowd funding projects (eg. building new grow room, buying equipment) and ask for loan / support. They can offer profit sharing and interest too (but this is not necessary).<br /><br />Why would you back a project? Good question. For fun. For good karma. For profit. Backing a project is more than just giving / investing some spare bitcoins, it&#039;s supporting the grower&#039;s dream and the cannabis culture.<br /><br />I was working really hard and the website is almost finished. It will be public in the next couple of days. Please be patient and don&#039;t be judgy before the public launch.<br /><br />I&#039;m still looking for 3 more beta tester for this service. Here is my message from last time:<br /><br />---<br /><br />Hey Fellow Grower,<br /><br />Do you need investment / loan to expand your growing business?<br /><br />Maybe I can help you.<br /><br />I&#039;m looking for experienced growers for a brand new darknet service. This service can help you get investment (in Bitcoin).<br /><br />This is a private beta test to validate the idea. So results are not guaranteed. We will launch soon.<br /><br />Most important:<br /><br />* you don&#039;t have to pay anything<br />* you can /and should/ stay anonymous<br /><br />However, this is not a magic button service. You have to put some extra work into it:<br /><br />* You need to make a business plan (2-3 page). (Scammers don&#039;t waste your time. It will be obvious if you are not an experienced grower.)<br />* You have to have a solid SR or SR forum history (or other evidence that you are trustworthy)<br /><br />EMail me if you qualify: cannabond@tormail.org (PGP: 0x60A82221)<br /><br />Testers: please keep the beta service link secret. I trust you.<br />

				Good idea but if/when people get busted the funds are gone, so returns on successful ops would have to be large to offset that.<br />Wouldn&#039;t it be susceptible to scammers too?<br /><br />
