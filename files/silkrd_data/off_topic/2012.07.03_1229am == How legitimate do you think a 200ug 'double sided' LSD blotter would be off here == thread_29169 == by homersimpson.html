				My friend ordered a few LSD blotters of this description off here with someone with nearly 200 transactions with a pretty good rating.<br />How legitimate do you think these will be? Does much RC&#039;s get passed off as LSD even on here?<br />Not really doubting the seller just people have told me this doesn&#039;t sound right for a blotter.<br />Also I don&#039;t have a test kit or anything

				Check the forum feedback for the vendor, see what people are saying.<br />I think sounds possibly legitimate. It&#039;s uncommon (from what I&#039;ve seen on SR), but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s possible.<br /><br />sdesu

				Are you talking about Vitacat? He made a post somewhere about his double sided blotters. From what i have read about this is that they are printed on both side, the quantity of LSD does not change. But i have to say the best blotters i have received (from juergens and NeuroticNarcotic) where double sided printed if i remember well. So premium blotters may be made that way.. i don&#039;t know but if he said it&#039;s 200 ug it should be true, the only way to have an answer is to do some of them my friend !&nbsp; ;)

				They were from mrsaha. He got them today, the vendor seems like a really pleasant person so I don&#039;t assume they will be bad.<br />However these blotters only have an image on 1 side and just normal white on the other side. Not sure if this means they aren&#039;t double sided in terms of potency as he just fliped and droped lsd onto the other side.<br />We&#039;ll be finding out in about a hour anyway ;D (1st time LSD but have had many different other psychedelics!!)

				Well considering you could make blotter out of a chinese takeout menu I&#039;m not too sure what bearing graphic style has on potency. It&#039;s basically acting as a sponge with a predetermined amount of solution made available for absorption.<br />Hope this clears up.<br /><br />-Cheers

				If you talking about the Alice in wonderland blotters, I would be very weary, they being sold by another vendor as much lower ug, and reviews dont suggest they that high. If you talking about Vitacats Mayans, they are legit.

				I know absolutely nothing about the vendor in question but I do know that the road has a problem with vendors incorrectly labeling their potency. One thing to keep in mind when ordering on here, especially ordering Lucy, is that if it&#039;s too good to be true than it probably is.

				LSD is still on my to-do list, and it&#039;s nice to finally see some listings for it up, but I don&#039;t know if I can trust any of these people. Especially the Alice in Wonderland ones. <br /><br />It really ticks me off when I see a new vendor with 100% feedback and a product I want, I get all excited and scroll down only to find that literally every single goddamn comment is from an idiot who FE&#039;d.<br /><br />Seriously, &quot;Finalizing early for trusted vendor&quot;? Trusted? Seriously?&nbsp; The dude has been a member for 13 days for fuck sake. Do these people have so much money that it literally takes up too much physical space in their houses? I can&#039;t imagine any other reason why anyone would be so goddamn stupid with their money.<br /><br />I can almost understand if you have no transactions and are buying from someone who has been here for months with 100%, but finalizing early for a guy with 40 transactions, almost all of which are other idiots finalizing early? Come on people..

				Double sided are definitely not meaning they are stronger. Mayans, dalai lamas, alice in wonderlands are all double sided and are different strengths. My friends have just laid a batch of alice in wonderlands, they are definitely 125 mics. Though that is not to say all the alice in wonderland trips come from my friends. You should always ask where did they get it from? With what crystal was it laid? Obviously what strength?&nbsp; Anyone who knows all this, and is believable is the Dude.&nbsp; &nbsp;:P

				Doesn&#039;t the whole blotter absorb the acid? So what good does dropping on the other side do?
