				<br />I&#039;m currently on suboxone to help with my addiction but it just isn&#039;t doing it.<br /><br /><br />Which opiate is more pleasurable? (I can&#039;t live without being at least buzzed off of opiates, I&#039;ve tried and I just can&#039;t do it so which one feels better? Also I get chronic migraines, which one would help better with pain?)<br />

				I don&#039;t have any experience with suboxone as it is generally not prescribed around here. I do however see literally thousands of patients who are on methadone. For many it replaces heroin and you see the same patient on 100 or even 160mg of methadone per dose or per day. I can&#039;t tell you how many people I&#039;ve seen who have taken it for 30 years when it was suppose to gradually ween them off. I&#039;m sure it works for some, but there is a regular stream of patients in and out of methadone treatment (sometimes using both methadone and continuing to use heroin). In my opinion, it has replaced heroin for some, but many go back because it is just not the same. It seems terribly addictive and dangerous to me, but I suppose it&#039;s better than heroin.<br /><br />My understanding of suboxone is that it has an antagonist as well and can cause withdrawal symptoms if given incorrectly - it seems more likely to help with complete opiate cessation than methadone, which seems to be a replacement. I don&#039;t have experience with suboxone though.<br /><br />A lot of the people we see on methadone have &quot;the nod&quot; similar to heroin... making me wonder if they&#039;re being given too much liquid dose or taking too many pills if they&#039;ve been trusted with pills. Also, of course you see that in combination with other opiates like heroin, oxycodone/cotin, vicodin.. rarely see morphine-type pills with methadone but once I saw someone with both a prescription for methadone and kadian I believe (the time released morphine). This person has sickle cell anemia though.

				Also, I saw a documentary about someone who grew and used their own magic mushrooms (can&#039;t remember what the spore name is, but you know)... Anyway, he took a moderate dose every 3 or so months and shockingly it kept the migraines away... he had tried dozens of other treatments and this is the only one that worked. He acted very sad like it was a huge burden having to trip on shrooms every few months. Given the alternative it doesn&#039;t seem like THAT terrible a treatment, I&#039;d certainly give it a try if there was a possibility of getting off opiates. I&#039;d probably want to research it some more before trying and check erowid to see if there is a bad interaction with opiates though.<br /><br />I&#039;d be interested to see if that helped... but not at the expense of hurting yourself. That reminds me, the narcan I stock is a complete antagonist and will throw you straight into withdrawal if injected... need to use nasal administration but that still might throw a heavy user into withdrawal if dosed too high.

I still wouldn&#039;t mind trying it if I personally suffered from migranes (I personally would rather take mushrooms every few months than be on opiates.... the times I&#039;ve been prescribed opiates I hardly shat and was sick to my stomach.... plus I hear being on mushrooms is kinda fun if you have a decent copy of lord of the rings or something&nbsp; ;) ....I don&#039;t advocate shrooms, but just sayin&#039; I think they&#039;re less harmful than opiates - I have NO references to back this up but based on experience I have seen opiates do FAR more damage than hallucinogens. Granted though, I see fair number of ex LSD users who have done permanent brain damage that has lasted well into middle age. The opiate users are often times in the end stages of life (prematurely I might add) I don&#039;t really know what to say).&nbsp;

I could swear that I&#039;ve heard that psychedelics can also help with migraines, but I could be wrong...<br /><br />I know BROMO-LSD(non-psychoactive LSD variant) also helps with cluster headaches, though. As far as that goes, bromo-LSD(LSD-bromo? Something like that) is a bit of a miracle-cure. I hope it hits it gets tested and FDA-approved, preferably soon. Fuck knows, those folks who get cluster headaches need it...

				yeah those cluster headaches sound gnarly... and christ with all the other unknown/unproven medicines they push the potential benefits seem to outweigh the risks. Shit look at YAZ or accutane and all the problems those meds have caused. And those are some of the SAFER ones (I know there&#039;s a ton of cancer fighting meds that themselves cause cancer).<br /><br />I should look those up.. need a good rest though<br />dream time.
