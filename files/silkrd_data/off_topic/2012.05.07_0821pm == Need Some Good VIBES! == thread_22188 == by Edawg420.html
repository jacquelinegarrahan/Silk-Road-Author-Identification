				Hello all!<br /><br />Just received a package from the silk road Woohoo! 1g of some DMT.&nbsp; I have always been a huge fan of psychedelics over the past couple years, and when i watched the DMT documentary on Netflix i have to say i was sold immediately.&nbsp; After doing some research on the best vendors here i made my purchase.&nbsp; Took some time but sure enough it has arrived.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ironic thing to all this is that i have been wanting this package for QUITE some time now.&nbsp; Literally sleepless some nights with anticipation.&nbsp; Finally now it is within my grasp and i am SCARED shit less to venture into the realm of hyperspace.<br /><br />Sure i have done a bunch of reading on it but i am a little nervous none the less.&nbsp; Was just seeing if anybody had some good experiences they might like to share?&nbsp; I really wanna try it but i am having second thoughts already haha.&nbsp; :o

				Lol same thing happened to me. I was so psyched and then it got here and I was like 0.o <br /><br />I sort of eased myself into it by starting with a ridiculously small dose, just enough to reach legoland. (You will know what I&#039;m talking about when you get there)<br /><br />That made me comfortable enough to go deeper, but I still was pretty anxious about it and still am. I&#039;m more scared of the actual act of smoking it than I am the experience, if that makes any sense. If you could just swallow DMT as a pill I know I would be able to do it without any hesitation.<br /><br />I&#039;ve found so far that it&#039;s not something to be feared. Every experience I&#039;ve had with it so far has been totally awesome and mesmerizing, it seems to have some kind of natural calming effect because the second the first hit reaches my lungs my anxiety washes away completely. All of the entities I&#039;ve encountered so far have been friendly, and show me a bunch of incredible stuff. The experience may only last 10 minutes but you&#039;ll be reflecting on it and glowing for weeks. Don&#039;t be too put off by the people who refer to the &quot;burnt plastic&quot; taste, it&#039;s quite an exaggeration. I grew used to the smoke fast enough and actually enjoy the taste now, tastes far better than MJ to me.<br /><br />One tip though, if you are using a freebase pipe, do not wipe away the resin around the bowl after your trip, leave it there and try hitting it again an hour later, there is usually enough to trip again. Wish I knew that earlier, it kills me to think of how much material I wasted

				So i finally decided to stop being a pussy and smoke the DMT.<br /><br />I started out with my 2 ft bong and emptied out all the water.&nbsp; After i put a little bit of pot in at the bottom of the slide and packed the rest up with Changa.&nbsp; I sat down and meditated for a second and the lightly kissed the changa with the lighter.&nbsp; I SLOWLY burned the changa trying to make as much smoke as i could as i chalked it up.<br /><br />Once it was fully chalked up i blew the little bit i got in my lungs as i chalked it up out.<br /><br />Then i committed and took a slow but steady rip from the already chalked bong.<br /><br />Held that in for about 5 seconds then blew it out, only to immediately follow up with the last amount of smoke in the bong.<br /><br />After i had taken that last hit i could feel a rush coming on.&nbsp; so i put the bong down and sat back in the recliner.&nbsp; <br /><br />At first all i could hear was like this ring or vibration buzzing in my head.&nbsp; A rush of extreme excitement came over me and felt like i was moving at extreme speeds.&nbsp; At this moment i knew i was in for the ride and i should just enjoy what i saw. <br /><br />At first i felt like i had lost complete control of my body.&nbsp; I must of looked like i was in a coma.&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t feel my heart beating, my chest expanding with air, or just me being there what so ever ( my buddy said my eyes were in the back of my head).&nbsp; There was a big ball of white light above my head behind me if that makes any sense, and i was really afraid to be sucked into it so i struggled to move and opened my eyes.&nbsp; Once i opened my eyes it looked like the world around me was electrified, patterns changing at INCREDIBLE speeds all over everything around me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I thought i was wasting the trip so i closed my eyes because it was more bearable now that i had a better grasp on my body.&nbsp; I have to say the body buzz is intense.&nbsp; Felt like i was kinda of drunk or a centripetal force was holding me to the seat or pushing me backwards.<br /><br />Once i closed my eyes again i saw the entity.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how i knew, but it was a female.&nbsp; Her face was a blinding white and blue light that i couldn&#039;t quite see, but i saw she had six arms almost identical to Shiva.&nbsp; I was listening to some trance music in the background and she was swaying and dancing to the music.<br /><br />Below her she had a tablet it looked like that she was floating over and it looked like a square maze that was constantly changing lines.&nbsp; Some very earth tone colors were on the tablet but it also looked electric for some reason.&nbsp; At this point i felt like i was kinda good on the whole trip so i opened my eyes again and saw the real world again.<br /><br />Still the carpet, table, walls, and couch where changing patterns very rapidly but i had complete control over my body and speach again.&nbsp; i Laughed out loud and couldn&#039;t stop saying OMG OMG that was so fucking insane.<br /><br />Honestly, the most extreme psychedelic i have EVER done and i know i only just tapped into the first plateau. What would have happened if i was sucked into that white light?&nbsp; IDK but i think that&#039;s what breaking through means.&nbsp; Honestly more happened but it was so indescribable i am not going to try.&nbsp; What i recorded here was the best explanation i could give.<br /><br />I look forward in traveling again but i think i want to try ingestion, i hear the onset is much more relaxing and you can spend some time exploring and understanding what is being shown to you.<br /><br />All in all DMT is amazing and has some sort of weird power to it.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure what effect another person being present would have if you managed to break through, but I smoked enough to have an experience on the level Edawg described with a friend in the room the other day, I didn&#039;t find it particularly distracting. The only thing was I felt compelled to &quot;hurry up&quot; if that makes sense, because my friend was just sitting there waiting for me to snap out of it.

I&#039;ve found that any outside disturbance doesn&#039;t exactly ruin my trip, but it seems better to let the DMT take you where it wants to take you without anything influencing it. One time my friend was playing guitar while i was tripping, and it was almost just an overload for my brain. but thats just my preference. And as for set and setting, your mental set is EVERYTHING. I guess setting isn&#039;t AS important because if you break through properly you won&#039;t be in that physical setting, but the importance of your mental mindset is definitely huge. I like to meditate and think of positive things before blasting into hyperspace.

				Also to Edawg-nice trip report man, I enjoyed reading it. My first time going off into hyperspace culminated in me facing 4 benevolent orange entities in an orange light filled room. I was outside at the time and it was sunny so im guessing thats why the &quot;room&quot; was orange. I started flowing (thats the only way I can possibly describe it) with one of the entities, and I somehow could tell it was a feminine presence. Needless to say, it was a mind blowing experience. I&#039;m glad your first experience was as well!

				Greetings fellow psyconauts!<br /><br />Thanks for the reply&#039;s guys, i am glad i could share that with everybody.&nbsp; <br /><br />@ blackend646, that is EXACTLY how i felt, i wanted to get back faster so i could tell him all about it and not really focus on the magic that was happening.&nbsp; Although he was quite thrilled to be there and hear the stories afterwards.&nbsp; So i IDK, i did feel more comfortable with a buddy in the room, but then again at the same time i felt i was kinda being judged.<br /><br />For those that asked i purchased from Dimitrispice.&nbsp; He took a while to get it to me but i have never been more touched by the experience.<br /><br />I smoked it again last night after i had about 3-4 beers at the bar.&nbsp; I have to say i was way more at ease when i was launching off.&nbsp; I will do a trip report when i get back from school, because as it is right now i am late.&nbsp; Lets just say that the experience was completely different and WAY MORE AMAZING.<br /><br />on a side note, EVERYBODY should try DMT 1x in their life.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say what happened but i feel like i am touched by some sort of spirit realm now, and i can&#039;t wait to try the original ayawaska brew some time.

				Nerves are normal my friend especially with any experiences that we encounter in life--day in and day out. Just find a day to use it when you had a really good day and you mind is clear--you will be fine, just let the trip happen. That&#039;s all you can do my friend :)<br /><br />And always have a good friend that you trust 100 percent, you dont need any other negativity on your mind when entering such a introspective space.. take care man! and let us know how it goes or anything else you need.
