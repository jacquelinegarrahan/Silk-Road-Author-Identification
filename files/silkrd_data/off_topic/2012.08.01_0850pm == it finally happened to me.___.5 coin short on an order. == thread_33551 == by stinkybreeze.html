				Appreciate the tip. Looks too involved to be doing where I&#039;m at this eve. If I can&#039;t get the $4 bucks by tonight then its not worth it. Order will just go in on Monday. No biggie......on another note this is such a ridicoulus situation.....come after Monday I will have coin......anyone else need a hand feel free to shout. If only I could push the four bucks in my pocket&nbsp; through the cell!!

				<br />HAHA, now &quot;97 cents&quot; from being able to purchase tonight due to coin fluctuation. 40 views and no one will throw a dollar? All good. <br /><br />Anyone else ever short a buck or two don&#039;t be discouraged, I always jump at the chance to throw a bone. So there is still people out there that will. They&#039;re just not on at the moment I guess. I actually think its hilarious now. I shall wait till next week for the order. Tired of trying to push this through this week. <br /><br />Happy trails fellow Roadies. <br /><br />

				<br />Got it and THANK YOU big time !!!&nbsp; Totally makes this buy a lot safer as I know I will be home for it. Otherwise it would have <br /><br />been sitting for possibly days, which is never something I like very much. You and another sent me coin. I will send both of you <br /><br />double back in a matter of days. Thanks again!
