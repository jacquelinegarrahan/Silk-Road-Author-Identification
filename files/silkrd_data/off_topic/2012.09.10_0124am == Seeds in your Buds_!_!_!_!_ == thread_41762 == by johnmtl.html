				Holly mollly... I guess anywhere.. it does not have to be SR specific...<br /><br />I&#039;m just not used to hearing things like that.. sticks and seeds in the bud?!?! I mean I know theres gotta be a stem.. bud wont grow on nothing.. but seeds are from hermaphrodite plants.. that shit never makes it to market where I&#039;m from.. for real I dont think I ever seen any seeds in any bud I smoked..<br /><br />even the cheep shit out here comes seed free!<br /><br />when you get weed with seeds is it like built in the bud??? or just loose in the bag??<br /><br />I&#039;m confused.

				&#039;Mexican&#039; bricked weed usually always has seeds in it. I assume in this case they are growing from seed and some males get through.<br /><br />A hermaphrodite is another cause - the plant self pollinating. This could be from stress or other factors like unscheduled lighting.<br /><br />The plant uses energy to create seeds. It would otherwise direct this energy towards bud formation which is what we want. We want a virgin female for the most potent smoke. Sensimilla is a mature virgin female cannabis flower. The word sensimilla comes from the spanish phrase &#039;sin semilla&#039; (without seed).<br /><br />OP: I best most all of us have. Now this was before SR though - there is no excuse for it anymore&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ve seen seeds in my bud maybe once in the past 10 years and that was from vancouver, canada. Only other time I&#039;ve seen seeds was when I was breeding trying to make seeds.<br />The reason you get seeds in your buds on SR is because where do you think people come to get rid of the shit they can&#039;t sell in person? You guessed it, right here. A lot of times on SR I get uncured, premature, seeded and hermied buds. Grow your own then you get the best of the best every time.

				It&#039;s weird because some of the best strains I&#039;ve smoked (locally, granted) contained seeds that my friends would find later in their bags. I had some super frosty, super dense OG-13 that was an absolute head-twister of a smoke, with quite a few seeds mature enough to grow into plants of their own. Another time some Purple Passion, which I know was grown indoors, had a few seeds in the buds while being as potent as purple strains come and equally fragrant. <br />One side of me wonders how these hermies were so potent, and if they could possibly have been so much better if kept strictly feminized by the grower. Another side of me says, look at Jamaica for instance, with large grows of powerful and seeded plants.

				Yeah, that;s what we consider commercial weed here too. Strains like northern lights, etc. With no seeds. Basically weed you can buy from a dealer is going to be cash cropping commercial bud.&nbsp; Mexican weed is just called garbage I don&#039;t even know people who smoke that shit. <br /><br />And no just because it doesn&#039;t have sticks are seeds doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s connoisseur grade...I&#039;m not even going to waste my time explaining it because you just don&#039;t get it.
