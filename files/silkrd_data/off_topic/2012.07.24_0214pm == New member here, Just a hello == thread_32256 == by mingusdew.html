				Greetings to all my (now) fellow SR members. This is brief personal introduction, though how user relationships p(l)ay out on this site is still an unknown to me. Any replies are welcome, whether they&#039;re generic tips or just friendly greetings.<br /><br />I am a long time TOR user, though this is my first attempt at leveraging it for anything other than blackhatting, my career in which ended last year due to a healthy dose of wisdom (no LE involvement!).<br /><br />My initial encounter with online substance trading was back in &#039;05. Not sure how many of you remember some private Asian forums and a search engine that only provided support if you entered in a legit seller&#039;s email. Any way, the point is I&#039;m old school, but no dinosaur in this realm.<br /><br />As the prices here on SR appear to rival those of my local (big city) dealers, I believe it at least worth a modicum of time to educate myself on the workings of the only (secure) public source of illicit substances around. No telling when I will make my first purchase at this point as there are no issues with local sellers at this point, however real life relationships are always a bit too close for my comfort in terms of a domino bust publicizing my name to the wrong folk.<br /><br />Anyway I will conclude with a big thanks to all those who keep this place running efficiently and honestly. That can&#039;t be an easy gig, and I sure can&#039;t fathom all the logistics necessary to maintain consistent uptime and anonymity of the site servers themselves, in whichever country they&#039;re located. That&#039;s all I got for now, look forward to future interactions with all y&#039;all.<br /><br />-Mingus

				Welcome Mingus :D<br /><br />Cool to see an &#039;old schooler&#039; here, I am by no means old school myself and have absolutely no idea what Asian forum you&#039;re talking about. But if you want to chit chat with everyone I suggest you&#039;d take a look around the forums and drop by in a thread.
