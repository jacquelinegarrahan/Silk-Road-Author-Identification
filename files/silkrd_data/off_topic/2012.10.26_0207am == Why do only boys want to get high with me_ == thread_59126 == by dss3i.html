				I get high with my boyfriend and a group of 5-10 boys. Sometimes some random girls who are hooking up with the boys will join and get high for the first time, but eventually they will be gone. I asked my best two female friends if they want to try some drugs with us and they raged at me. Why is it like this? Why do only boys want to get high? I live in Sweden and only 1/20 women have as much as tried weed here (1/10 men), so it is semi-hard to find drug liberals and harder to find female drug liberals (it&#039;s easier among youth, though). Recently we had some cops in school telling us we can become addicted to weed after one drag from a joint. My friends don&#039;t believe this, but they think the truth is rather that you become addicted if you smoke the entire joint... I believe there are a lot of females doing drugs on SR, is it the same for you or do you have girls to get high with? A few girls who are into the party scene asked me for drugs in school, but I told them I got none, because I really have no interest in supplying this annoying group of girls with ecstacy for their one crazy night. I wish I knew some girls who wanted to just chill out with drugs. They boys are nice enough, but why are there no girls?!

				That does seem strange. I am a guy, but I know PLENTY of girls in my city that love to do drugs just as much, if not more, than I do. Maybe find some new friends? :D To me, there is just something so attractive about a girl who knows and loves her drugs. They are out there, maybe just closet drug takers? You&#039;d be surprised how low-key most keep their drug use. Unlike me, I just kind of put it out there for everyone, and fuck em&#039; if they don&#039;t like it!

I have noticed that most people who are against the use of drugs, generally tend to be more close minded in life. I used to have so many friends man, i am not friends with anymore, who thought my drug use would lead to me dying or some shit. They thought they ere looking out for me coz they pestered me everyday and said drugs are bad. And when i would try to speak to them, i realized that thats all they know, drugs is bad, but they do not actually have any information or knowledge about drugs, so how the fuck can they know anything? I think everyone is responsible for themselves, its fucking irritating hen people your age, and people considerably fucking stupid just come to u and say &#039;drugs, noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo you be insane!&#039;

				Maybe you come off the wrong way to other girls?&nbsp; Do you have a hard time making girl friends in general?&nbsp; I think this is more of a problem with you making women friends than with girls not wanting to do drugs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most girls I know who only hang out with guys are unbearable to be around, and the guys put up with their shit because they want to get laid or are hoping that the girl will introduce them to some other girls that she knows.&nbsp; Not that they are bad people, but inm High School and college they generally were whiny, dramatic, or know it alls who would try to one up other girls.

				Guys prefer female friends over male friends, it&#039;s been researched.&nbsp; So that&#039;s probably part of the equation, guys are basically desperate to spend time with women, (I know I am) even if its all just friends time.&nbsp; Females prefer female friends though, so that can&#039;t be all of it.&nbsp; How attractive do you and others consider yourself?

I can say as much as that physical attractiveness doesn&#039;t matter to my friends and I when we pick our friends. I&#039;m not denying it matters in choosing a love partner/ sex partner, but that&#039;s not what we are talking about here. <br /><br />I also don&#039;t have a lack of female friends in general. I have a lack of drug loving female friends specifically.

				Maybe you are not in the right circles to meet the type of girl that takes drugs.<br /><br />If I go clubbing (especially trance and house type clubs) I can easily meet girls who take drugs and want to exchange phone numbers for &quot;coffee sometime&quot;<br /><br />But hey, all that male attention, can&#039;t be bad ;)

				There is a gender issue with most of people I work with 2/10 would be female, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a representative of female users but society frowns on female drug users compared to male drug users (which is wrong),&nbsp; this could be why you tend to attract the lads rather than the females , I do know that female IDU&#039;s tend to use with a male partner , females taking crack tend to use together or with a male partner.<br /><br />The other thing I have noticed is that there tends to be significantly more males on here compared to females ...Why is this ????

				a female member of the ILF here ...<br /><br />Thank you, OP dss3i, for starting this topic!&nbsp; There are so many factors, I think, that go into this issue.&nbsp; One is that women ultimately see themselves as more responsible, and in many ways, more practical, than men.&nbsp; So if her man wants to go off and get high or, say, have insane and impractical hobbies which may even be legal, a woman thinks to herself, &quot;Well, that&#039;s just what he&#039;s interested in ...&quot; though she does not, herself, have any interest in doing things outside the realm of school/work/family/friends.&nbsp; Or so she tells herself.&nbsp; Women tend to see themselves as supportive, and they tend to value relationships above other concerns, so it follows for many that to pursue interests on their own is selfish, even unreasonable, because it takes away time she could be (ought to be) devoting to her school/work/family/friends.&nbsp; And we know as a fact from God (who is male, btw), that women are gentler and more moral.&nbsp; So if drugs are bad (which we are taught from a very early age), and they are enmeshed in crime (thanks to a retarded legal system), it also follows these &quot;gentle, more moral&quot; creatures are less interested.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But there are even more reasons, I think, that there are fewer girls.&nbsp; The seeking-for-ego-gain behavior that men exhibit in almost everything, from kickball on the playground to driving BMW&#039;s is less common in girls, not because they don&#039;t have strong and terrible egos --they do-- but because they don&#039;t get as much social status from the same activity that a boy does.&nbsp; Girls go out less, and they go out less alone; whereas men will frequent bars all by themselves, (oftentimes looking to meet a girl).&nbsp; So many good drugs are inherently social, and if you have a pretty insular social circle (because you&#039;re not out all the time meeting strangers), you&#039;re going to have a harder time getting into the scene.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ILF, in fact, is surrounded by single men.&nbsp; Pretty much all the time.&nbsp; Female members of the ILF are constantly asking themselves, &quot;WHERE ARE ALL THE GIRLS!!??&quot; because, seriously, it&#039;s hard to hang out with that much sausage all the time.&nbsp; This in itself may be a symptom of an increasingly individualistic (hence alienating) society, but it coincides nicely with a lack of girls who like to take drugs.&nbsp; I guess I&#039;m saying it&#039;s hard to really tease out the reasons one by one, because they, like, say, poverty or war, are so intertwined.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, in my experience, as a girl who loves her drugs (and who doesn&#039;t like alcohol), yeah, the truth is, it is a little lonely.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned to fly under the radar on small doses of E or even psychedelics when I&#039;m out with people who are not into it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also learned that girls, even my mom!, are interested in hearing about drugs when they are drunk, so I&#039;m always hoping (and sometimes it works out) that that&#039;s the moment they&#039;ll take the plunge.&nbsp; You never know!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;

				I agree though. While you do find girls that like to get fucked up, it&#039;s not to the same extent as guys do.It&#039;s very cultural - we&#039;re generally taught to be careful what we take, be mindful of our drinks, etc etc, that we have to be the responsible ones because no one is going to take care of you. Which is a good rule of thumb to live by, but it makes lots of girls overly cautious. They&#039;re less inclined to go out there and experiment also because of a certain image that they want to maintain whether conscious or not.<br />But then there are those others who don&#039;t really give a fuck, the type of girl who doesn&#039;t always take other drugs but has her own to offer, is the last to go to sleep and the first down for a party, the one who will be at a house with 30 guys and maybe 2 other chicks where everyone is spaced out. In all honesty I can tell you which one I&#039;d rather be.

The clubs here close at 5 am which is early compared to Spain, Germany and so on. They also aren&#039;t as big as the clubs I&#039;ve seen and heard about down south. And foremost, Swedes usually don&#039;t think what they have is as good as what other people have, or they don&#039;t want to say it, because they don&#039;t want to be bragging. I guess we do have some trance and house clubs, which while they aren&#039;t anything size wise compared to the ones down south, still play decent music. :)

I got a fake ID at 16 and it was fun the first few times, but haven&#039;t been to a club in over a month now. I also haven&#039;t been to trance and house clubs because they don&#039;t exist in my country. <br /><br />And it&#039;s not bad, but I think a few more girls in our group would enhance the group. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ummm.. are you not from Sweden?? I think you said that before.. anyways.. I was just talking with a friend the other day who just got back from Sweden and he said and i quote &quot;they spin some wild house tracks in the clubs down there&quot; <br /><br />Please keep in mind that this came from the mouth of a DJ who spins house music in one of montreal&#039;s most popular afterhours club... If he said that, then there must be some siiiick shit down there!! just find it... if you not from Sweden and its my mistake then please forget all this unless you want to go here sick house music in Sweden.. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Cool. The clubs here close at 5 am which is early compared to Spain, Germany and so on. They also aren&#039;t as big as the clubs I&#039;ve seen and heard about down south. And foremost, Swedes usually don&#039;t think what they have is as good as what other people have, or they don&#039;t want to say it, because they don&#039;t want to be bragging. I guess we do have some trance and house clubs, which while they aren&#039;t anything size wise compared to the ones down south, still play decent music. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like fun, you should go and take a friend with you.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go by yourself, safety first for us girls.&nbsp; Go make some new friends and enjoy yourself.&nbsp; You are only young once.

				Yea enjoy yourself and be patient because the type of friends you are looking for will show up for you but don&#039;t force it. Play the game. Look, listen, communicate with others and soon you&#039;ll find that girls with the same interest as you will come along. So relax, enjoy yourself, and have a good time. Don&#039;t even waste any thought on things that cause stress.<br /><br />Learn how to play that game and the world will be yours dss3i<br />

				I agree with you OP. Couldn&#039;t tell you why, but that&#039;s what I&#039;ve seen too.<br /><br />I feel like girls are too cautious. Maybe its society, maybe its genetics, either way, it sucks. <br /><br />Honestly though, you have it easy. Boys are always down to do drugs. And even if their not, they typically will not reject a girl because the girl has done drugs. As a man, dating is extremely annoying when you have to hide your drug use from someone in the beginning of the relationship, because you know it would freak them out.<br /><br />I&#039;m not exactly the type of person that broadcasts my drug use. I&#039;m not high 24/7, and I&#039;m very responsible about it. With that said, I have no problem going on a heroin or coke binge for a couple days when I need to relax. Most girls I know, even if they smoke weed or will take x, will still have a problem with that. A big one. Finding a girl who would join me? Well, would be awesome, but I&#039;m not counting on it. Guess I have to keep hiding it, because that&#039;s fightworthy to most girls I&#039;ve dated, and dumpworthy for some.

				International Love Federation.&nbsp; The &quot;I&quot; could likewise be for Intra-national.<br /><br />ILF also stands for &quot;Sweet Nothings of the Yellow Brick Road&quot; through mystical acronym rules which we do not profess to fully understand. <br /><br />Moreover, we are always open to other interpretations. :D
