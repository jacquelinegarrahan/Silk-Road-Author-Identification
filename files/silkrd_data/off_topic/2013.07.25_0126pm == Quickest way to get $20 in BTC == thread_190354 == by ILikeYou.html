				WTF is it so hard to get BTC in small amounts. bitinstant.com was my go to. Getting verified on coinbase right now and then my online BTC Seller wants $400 minimum.<br /><br />I just need $20 to try some stamps before buying the $400 so I can buy a gram.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea?<br /><br />Anyone wanna buy a $20 vanilla reload card :)

				&nbsp;https://www.btcquick.com/beta/<br />&nbsp;great rates for small amounts..blows the whole run about for bitninstant routine out of the water..but you do have to register and all takes a few minutes. Just depends how worried one is about buying btc and being identified for it.

				Anyone else have experience with btcquick? I don&#039;t like that they won&#039;t show me their exchange rate until I sign up.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen anything good on the forums about it, and one thread suggests it&#039;s a scam:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=90338.msg636993#msg636993

				It isnt a scam, I had a an issue with one order for .5btc that got hung up in their system , I put in a support ticket, a few hours later I had gotten double my order..free as a way to make up for the wait.&nbsp; I have used them about 7-8 times for anywhere from 20-50$ and usually I have the btc in a half an hour.<br /><br />Now yesterday they were out of coin, that can happen too it would seem, but I have no complaints, I have been treated more then fairly.

				Not too long ago I was viewing my local paper online and there was an ad saying Buy Bitcoins and I was like WTF! It was for BTCQuick, I did some checking...got verified and such. They charge like a $3 fee for verification, then once you are approved the starting membership rate is purchasing the bitcoins for 7% above the current market rate plus a .30 processing fee.&nbsp; Once I submit my order, usually within a half hour I have a Private Key loaded in my account which I then tumble through a few accounts where it finds its way in my SR wallet.&nbsp; Not too concerned about being verified to buy bitcoins as I usually just buy small amounts of Primo Weed and some occasional LSD so I guess I&#039;m willing to take my chances.&nbsp; Also signed up for a backup account with Coinbase and made my initial purchase and after 30 days will have the ability to buy instantly instead of the current 4 business day wait. There are times when BTCQuick has 0 BTC in stock so its not always 100% but still a great way to buy Bitcoins. Forgot to mention BTCQuick can also checkout your order via Google checkout so a charge from Google instead on BTCQuick is on your CC.&nbsp; Oh yea and one more thing...Fuck BitInstant!
