				Obviously the letter makes the substances different, and they have different effects, but what is it about the letter that does that?<br /><br />And how far does it go?<br /><br />Will we someday be saying &quot;holy fuck! I really loved that 25p-nbome, but avoid the 25j I heard it gives half the population uncontrollable muscle spasms for like a week.&quot;&nbsp; And what about the number? Could there 50i-nbome. 100i?

				Relating to erowid it means:<br /><br />2C-C-NBOMe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;phenethylamine<br />2C-I-NBOMe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;phenethylamine<br />Mescaline-NBOMEe →<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;3,4,5-trimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine<br /><br />Source: http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nbome/nbome.shtml<br /><br />the number just means the relation of the chemicals in the molecule. I&#039;m not an professional chemist, but a 50i seems to be pretty unstable and unrealistic to me.

				They&#039;re related to phenethylamine cousins.<br /><br />&quot;i&quot; is for iodo, &quot;c&quot; is for chloro. You&#039;d have to look at the chemical structure to understand it more.<br /><br />My friend is a chemist and briefly explained it to me but I was too stoned to care.

				The 25 refers to the two methoxy groups at the 2 and 5 positions on the ring, and the letter (F, C, B, or I) refers to the substituent at the 4 position.

				I would be lieing if I claimed to fully grasp those answers, but those were the answers I was looking for.<br /><br />Thanks guys!

				Yeah, it&#039;s all about the bonding of the elements but unless you&#039;ve tried it or read reviews I don&#039;t see how knowing the molecular structure of the drug really helps you understand what effect it will have on you (unless you are really well-versed in chemistry and even then you&#039;d also need familiarity with the particular molecular compounds in question). <br /><br />Cheers

				Here&#039;s my review on each of the ones I tried so far, b/c/d and i (hope to be trying g in a few months). <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=36654.msg423921#msg423921<br /><br />Over on BlueLight they discuss the chemicals in theory, synthesis, and how the chemical make-up affects certain aspects of the trip. You&#039;ll read things like: 25e turned out to be very weak and 2c-h has no psychedelic value at all because ...

				No need to repeat all that&#039;s been said but to answer your question directly &quot;what do the letters NBOMe mean&quot; it means that there is an Ortho-MethoxyBenzyl substituent at the amine nitrogen of the the substituent phenethylamine (the 25 and I,C, etc. part&#039;s have already been explained by Tryptamine in this thread)
