				I have the wish to try LSD and have some questions:<br />-What dose would you suggest for the first time(how many ug)?<br />-What sellers are good and have a decent price? (I want to buy low quantity -&gt; Buy for 1-3 experiences)<br />-Any tips for the first time taking LSD? (For example stay alone in room, be in the nature, good special activities to do, stay with friends, at day or nighttime?)<br /><br />Thank you already for your answers&nbsp; :)

				Hey Andi,<br /><br />dosage wise I would recommend 150 to 200 mcgs, that will give you a full scale trip with open and closed eye visuals.<br /><br />My last order where these:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/35fe7ba9a6<br />Two of those should do the trick for you.<br /><br />Pro tips for your first time are: Two days of your free time, one for the experience, one to relax afterwards. Use it between 8 am and 12 am, that guarantees you will be able to sleep at night. You will need to be somewhere where you can @totally@ be yourself eg. where you can sing, dance, cry and laugh. Where you can be without any disturbance from the outer world. Bring a good friend, someone you trust and someone who can hug you if necessary. This is very important, because LSD can show you things that were buried in your subconsciousness. Physical closeness eases such experiences a lot and takes the edge of them.<br /><br />Hmmm, basically that&#039;s it. My biggest mistakes were not having a sitter when I really needed one and ingesting 200mcg at 9pm when I was already really tired.<br /><br />Good luck tripping, let us know your your trip went.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				You usually get pretty good answers on the road concerning drugs. I wonder why.
