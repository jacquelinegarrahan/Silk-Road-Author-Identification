Invest in something tangible, SECOND. And if you still have extra income, open an account with OptionsXpress (my personal opinion) and do more homework (investopedia.com) than buying and selling. Don&#039;t get emotional, and you just might make some money.

				Thanks guys, I&#039;ll check out those links for sure!<br /><br />And just my luck, I was trying to buy a bunch of stuff on SR today, and of course Dwolla had to be down today so I couldn&#039;t buy anything...<br /><br />AND of course, bitcoins drop in price bigtime...sigh..would of had a nice discount buying stuff like I wanted to today...damnit. I&#039;m hoping it goes back up a bit by tommorow now instead of this huge decline.

				What country are you based in?<br /><br />There are many online brokerages you can choose from. Just don&#039;t let your emotions get in the way of trading. Biggest lesson I have learned.

				Check out the following for a small list of online brokers in the U.S:<br /><br />**CLEARNET WARNING**<br />http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/online-brokers/#.UVYi1xxTARI<br />**CLEARNET WARNING**<br /><br />Yep, emotions will fuck you up when it comes to trading. You need to base your investment decisions on logic and a little bit of luck. That said, there are a number of strategies other traders will swear by, that may not work for you personally. It&#039;s all about finding the right ones, doing your homework and going from there. Maybe start out with a dummy account and see how you go after one week. Personally, I do not hold for longer than 48 hours when trading, but that is just me. I have 3 stocks that I keep due to their solid dividends. The others I day trade.<br /><br />Another piece of advice: stay away from CFD&#039;s (although I&#039;m pretty sure these are banned in the U.S) unless you really know what you&#039;re doing.<br /><br />I see BTC as a solid investment for the forseeable future, due to the growth of SR and instability in the EU. Can&#039;t hurt to hold a few coins in a dummy SR account for a month or so...

				Read at least one reputable book about trading before you try risking anything more than 2% of your annual income.<br /><br />That&#039;s my advice.&nbsp; I would read three or four, and mess around with a few thousand to start.<br /><br />lelmeriodici
