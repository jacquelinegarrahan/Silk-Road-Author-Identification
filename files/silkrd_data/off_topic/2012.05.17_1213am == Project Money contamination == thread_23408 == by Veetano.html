			<dd class="postbody">
				For the past week, I have been rubbing small amounts of liquified hash oil on all my bills.<br /><br />To be more specific, when you make hash oil, it usually comes in a very sticky almost solid form. When you heat it up inside a pyrex dish on hot plate, the carboxyl group evaporates. After the COOH group evaporates the THC is 100% active (as heating is needed when making edibles, the COOH group is the reason)<br /><br />Anyways, once the carboxyl group evaporates, the hash oil is strictly a oil and will not solidify in any way. <br /><br />In an experiment, at my place of work, I distributed a cleverly marked $1 bill to a repeat customer, and weeks later I was surprised to see this bill show up again. I examined it, and I could STILL smell the hash oil on it.<br /><br />I put just enough COOH-Evaporated hash oil on each bill so they wont stick together in stacks, wont have a strong enough odor to register to people who aren&#039;t distinctly aware of the smell, but dogs will light up on it.<br /><br />For those of you who don&#039;t know, hash oil will NEVER come out, unless washed out with a strong alcohol/butane/ethanol/acetone wash - which the average person wont do by accident. Hash oil ruins clothes because it is so hard to get out and the chemicals required to get it out would ruin the clothing. Meaning, hash oil will NEVER come off of the dollar bills unless processed in the way as mentioned, or heated very very hot.<br /><br />This may sound like a dickish thing to do, but think of it this way. What&#039;s the use in having drug dogs if they go off on every person who is carrying money. Cop has money in his wallet? Haha, oh officer, looks like the dog smells drugs on you. <br /><br />Once the bills are in somebodies wallet, a small amount of hash oil inevitably gets on their wallets, same with cash registerers, and anywhere else a bill touches. A small amount also inevitably rubs off on a persons hand, and given this is concentrated THC, the dog would smell it easily.<br /><br /><br />Money, the number one thing all humans handle and interact with. We&#039;ll see how effective drug dogs are now when the scent of their favorite toy is practically everywhere, in everyones wallets, on everyones money.<br /><br /><br />A similar thing can be applied to the mail systems. Spray an 97% alcohol based solution with hash oil in every mail box, it will leave a film of THC on everything in there only detectable in small quantities by dogs. <br /><br />I know some people will hate me for this, but in the long run, if their dogs become so useless and inaccurate due to this, there will be no point in using them. <br /><br />ANYONE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROJECT. The amount of hash oil made from 3.5g of high quality nug can be put in small amounts on HUNDREDS of bills. Hash oil is very easy to make and basic extraction equipment cost around $15 total. A metal cylinder of some type, coffee filters, butane, etc. Plus the $60 of weed, but that amount will go a very long ways. <br /><br />Hash oil can ultimately be made from any kind of weed, doesn&#039;t need to be dank. I probably went the more expensive rout. I got .4g of oil off of $60 worth of weed. $50 could get you an ounce of trimmings on SR that would yield you 2-3g of hash oil. Do the math.<br /><br />Simply 20, $1 bills used at various stores will spread all around the county in a matter of hours. Imagine hundreds.&nbsp; <br />

				If even more than a single person did this, or a single person with concentrated effort did this, in a single area, the entire place would be contaminated in days.<br /><br /><br />I would simply go to the bank, get a few hundred singles, or as many as you can get, put lights amount of this oily hash liquid on them, not enough to taint the apperance of the bill. Use whatever applicator you can find.. toothbrush, dipping the bill, etc. You could coat a few hundred bills subtly and lightly in about an hour.<br /><br />Go to a mcdonalds/retail store. Ask for change. Boom. They&#039;re going to be giving out those singles all day long. Best time to go is early in the morning. If you go at night you might run the risk of those same singles simply going back to the bank the next day when the store owner makes his deposit. I used to work in retail a few years ago so I know the jist of things. <br /><br />Then repeat.<br /><br />A few hundred bills, $60 worth of weed, and you don&#039;t loose any of your cash, you get it back when you change it. <br /><br />Hash oil can ultimately be made from any kind of weed, doesn&#039;t need to be dank. I probably went the more expensive rout. I got .4g of oil off of $60 worth of weed. $50 could get you an ounce of trimmings on SR that would yield you 2-3g of hash oil.

I remember back a week ago when I made my hash oil and I remembered how sticky it was and how hard it was to clean off of items.<br /><br />I got some on my hand and I didn&#039;t have any alcohol to wash it off... so I litterely got high off the oil through my skin, which sort of pissed me off since I had shit to do. But I read online it can ruin clothes and stuff and just basically put it together in my head that hash oil is a bitch to handle! <br /><br />I had planned on never making it again because it&#039;s so difficult to clean and handle, like damn. But I thought up this clever idea ;)

				Another thing that could be done to spread hash oil around in general is this:<br /><br />You know the touch pads at all stores where you enter the pin number for your debit card? Simply dip your finger in the hash oil before you leave the house. Be careful not to touch anything on the way there. <br /><br />Go buy something cheap, and enter your pin. But mess up a few times, be sure to hit each number on the screen. What you&#039;ve done now, the stores are likely NOT going to clean it off and each person that uses a debit card will get the oil on their hands... and on their cars.. and on anything they touch... even on their own dollar bills.<br /><br />You would be essentially, making people participate in the project without them having a clue! Do this everyday or a few times aday at a few stores... haha, you got em. This hash oil essentially spreads like a virus because it clings to everything it touches and is very strong on a molecular level. Just think of how a virus spreads. Expect this is much more durable than a virus, practically undetectable, etc. <br /><br />Thc will be everywhere.

				Im off to get some some hash oil now JUST so i can start doing this here where I live...<br /><br />Ive doing a variation of this for a while now, when I ever get my hands on stalks and stem, i put them through the coffee grinder, then i release the dust in public buildings with carpets that will trap the particles as well as around my neighbourhood.<br /><br />This however is MUCH MUCH better ! <br /><br />we should call it &quot;operation sticky/stinky&quot; and spread it around the world...monkey wrenching on global scale !

				Now I don&#039;t own a drug dog myself haha(I wish), but I think it&#039;s safe to assume they can smell THC in very very tiny amounts. Meaning, I haven&#039;t seen a direct effect of my plan work, but in theory, it should work excellently.<br /><br />If as many people participated as possible... man, the effect would be massive. <br /><br />If it was sprayed in mail boxes, any other mail it touches would be contaminated. People who touch the mail would get it on their hands and pass it along.<br /><br />If this is done on a consistent level and enough people participate, the effect could be monumental.

				I applaud your guerrilla scenting tactics.<br /><br />Where I live, they only bring the dogs in when they think there is a reason to, and they want to avoid requiring a warrant.&nbsp; The dog &quot;hits&quot; on the scent and then they tear your car/house/apartment apart.<br />Funny if they start doing it to random citizens, but if they&#039;re targeting YOU then you&#039;re hosed if possessing anything of substance.<br /><br />So DO IT, but don&#039;t drive around with weed or other drugs in your car!<br />I know most bills have traces of coke on them, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s enough to set off a dog, this is a way stinkier and awesome idea.<br /><br />Operation GreenStink 2012

				We need a few baggage handlers to spray that oil all over the gloves they use and then every single bag that they touch will be coated with the marijuana scent.&nbsp; This would be great for an international flight where they actually sometimes use the dogs.&nbsp; Every single bag would have that scent.<br /><br />

				This is a brilliant idea. I will try to contaminate some bills in my country.<br /><br />Another way of spreading awareness is to plant weed at random places. Whenever you sort of those annoying seeds from the low-grade weed you bought - just save it. It is a very robust plant that will grow under almost any conditions.<br /><br />A variation, that I successfully tried out 2 years ago is to buy 1 kg of seeds for around 3 euros. Where? In pet stores. They are sold as bird-seeds for their high nutrition value. They will grow like a motherfucker, but they have been genetically changed so you cant get high from them. But with a little luck and just a few generations of DNA mutations they will be smoking hot again :)

				Perhaps hopefully sometime next week I can redo this process but do a picture tutorial. Compile a list of cheap items and this thread can be stickied.<br /><br />Imagine if this thread was at the top of every forum.. everyone would see it, and a large group of people are likely to participate...<br /><br />Also, this thread alone will create a greater market for trimmings and leaves, which I didn&#039;t consider as a side effect, but this is good, stimulate the bitcoin economy! <br /><br />-- <br /><br />I also have some other ideas up my sleeve that are in the works. The money thing works great locally, but I want this to be effective on a global/international level. If you have any ideas, feel free to contribute them!<br /><br />I also really liked that baggage handler idea. People handling baggage with sticky thc covered gloves.<br /><br />What about if somebody simply identified a point at airports that everybody touches. Then with a clever spray device up the sleave, spray a light spritz of alcohol diluted thc oil all over it. If it is something everyone touches this will enable the THC oil to be spread to foreign place. Might loose some effectiveness since they are on the flight for a while and have time to absorb it into their hands, but none the less, some will make it through on luggage, etc!

				Ooo something else I just thought up.<br /><br />It may be easier to simply lightly spray the a bottle of rubbing alcohol with the hash oil diluted in it, onto the bills.<br /><br />Spray them and let them dry? I haven&#039;t tried this yet, but it seems to be easier than painting the bills.<br /><br />With that spray bottle you can spray anything, door handles to stores, resturants, etc. At the same time you will be killing germs on the doors and spreading the lovely marijuana! haha! <br /><br />I&#039;m gonna try this today and make some more hash oil.<br /><br />If you wish to test this method, here are some tips.<br /><br />Before spraying, shake the bottle vigerously. Hash oil is attracted to other particles of hash oil. They will accumulate if left to sit.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to try 2 variations of this technique, one with hash oil that has not been evaporated, which is stickier, yet more detectable. And another with hash oil that has the COOH group evaporated, this form is more oily, yet still very sticky and hard to clean<br />...<br /><br />Edit: Spray that shit on cop cars... LOL. Rain will not wash that off.

				Wow, it really looks like you&#039;ve got a bandwagon going with this idea...&nbsp; I on the other hand think it would be more useful to save this glut of extra hash oil you seem to enjoy wasting.. oh and while you&#039;re at it maybe you should (all?) smoke a little less and it will become apparent that rubbing hash oil on various items to throw drug sniffing dogs off your trail is probably more apt to get them locked on to you.&nbsp; Not only would you be releasing hash oil itself into circulation, but.. ah fuck it..

				This makes me want to drop money on the ground in Schiphol airport just for the fun of it, right in front of a Delta flight back to Atlanta in the USA. Can we say, Hash Mob?&nbsp; ;D

				OP, you are the recipient of my second +1 since breaking 100. Absolutely brilliant, no better word for it.<br /><br />Somebody mentioned trace amounts of coke in bills. It&#039;s right that it&#039;s too small an amount to be significant, unless you have an obscene amount of money somewhere like an undeclared small fortune in the airport. (I of course got this from the book/move 21, and while movies are not generally lauded as reliably credible sources this is only logical.)<br /><br />The hash oil, of course, is quite more aromatic than coke. I&#039;m so all over this.

				I have taken a supersoaker and filled it with rubbing alcohol mixed with hash oil and been spraying it all over downtown my city. I drive around at night and my friend sprays it out of the passenger window. Done so in such a way that a camera cant see it.<br /><br />A single night we&#039;ve hit almost a hundred door handles, tons of police cars, and many more. Mwuahahah stinky stinky hash oil everywhere. Take that police dogs. <br /><br />We&#039;ve also been hitting drop-off mailboxes that mail men have to touch. So every piece of mail they touch gets contaminated with hash oil.
