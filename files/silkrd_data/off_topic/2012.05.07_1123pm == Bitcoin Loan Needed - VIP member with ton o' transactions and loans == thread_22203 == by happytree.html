				Looking for a short term (4-5 bus days) bitcoin loan for $195.00&nbsp; - I will repay $195.00 + 30.00 loan fee as soon as my transfer is completed from dwolla.<br /><br />I have completed over 33 transactions on SR,&nbsp; and I have also completed approximately 10 short terms loan such as this, by way of community forums (just ask around!) <br /><br />

I&#039;ve completed many, many successful loans on here, so I guess I have the right to ask. If people don&#039;t want to, they don&#039;t have to, as evidenced by your second statement.<br /><br />2) How is it outdated? I don&#039;t believe weapons should be on SR. Period. As far as the CP, I&#039;ll just keep it there for good measures. But thanks for being so concerned.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1) I know that, happytree. calm down. I&#039;m just saying, asking for a loan of that amount, it&#039;s not gonna be easy to find someone who will<br />2) I already explained how it&#039;s outdated! Weapons are not sold on SR AT ALL... TA was made as a completely separate site. If&nbsp; want to push for it, push for TA not being associated with SR. But some of us need to sell off our weapons. ever thought about that?

And yes, I have thought about it, and I don&#039;t agree with weapons being on SR, for a variety of reasons. Good luck to you kind sir! I will update my outdated sig!!!
