				Anyone have any tips on growing indoors? I just ordered a couple seeds and in the mean time of waiting I am trying to figure out how I am going to go about this all. I have a small greenroom in my basement with a treadmill and chair just wasting space. I am going to clear it out to experiment a little. However the room hasn&#039;t been used in years in seems, I noticed today the heat control does not work. The thermometer does fortunately, all the windows are transparent and one opens.. Im not good with measurements but id say this is like an 8x6 or 8x8 greenhouse, more like a greenroom I guess. anyway now that its the fall there is less sunlight and as i said the temp control doesn&#039;t work in the room so im conflicted how to go about this using the resources i have. What would be best to go about a situation like this if anyone knows? I have some florescent lights(not in the greenroom, the green rooms lighting is very generic and poor) and I have this other room I could use inside but its not a green room &amp; Id rather use as much sunlight as possible when growing these to get some nice quality and a yield if I possible. This is my first time however so I cant say I know what to expect. Wish me luck!<br /><br />The 3 seeds i got were:&nbsp; <br />Bubble Gum Feminized<br />Northern Lights AUTO-Feminized <br />&amp; AK-47 Feminized&nbsp; <br /><br />Also Soil, Fertilizers, and watering cycles anything else I should know. I know very newbish to ask, but everyones gotta start somewhere; &amp; I know there are bright minded people here on the road who can shed me some light on some horticulture and let me know how to do this right. its something I look forward to and have been waiting a long time to do! :) Ill be checking and responding to posts<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Youre gonna need to start off by making sure if you use a tent or just the entire room that it can get 100% dark. That is one of the most important steps.<br /><br />Lighting wise if you can afford it and deal with the heat look into MH/HPS (if on a tighter budget just go with HPS). LED&#039;s are very expensive and hard to find good ones. If that setup is too expensive look into CFL&#039;s. 2700K for flowering and 6500k for growing. For 3 plants you will need at least 300 (?) watts. Thats my guess. The more actual watts the better. <br /><br />Circulation is also important. Get a big fan for the room and use it.<br /><br />An automated timer for the lights is a must. Either 24h or 18h on for growing and 12/12 for flowering.<br /><br />If odor is a concern look into carbon filters.<br /><br />There are tons of guides online (grasscity, rollitup, icmag, etc) about germination and planting. read everything you can.<br /><br />Best of luck to you!

				also be careful about growing indoors if you are in a state that doesnt allow it, i just moved out of CO where its legal... and i had a pretty large crop (45 plants) and they were all hydro. i started off with soil but i found that it was just better for me to use hydro<br /><br />i had quite a few patients so i was able to grow that much... but if you are in a state that doesnt allow green to be grown, if you have a nice amount of wattage coming from your plants the electricity company will know <br /><br />but if not! heres a small tip from me :)<br /><br />i would suggest for the veg. state that you use MH lights and keep them on a 18 hours of light and 6 hours off.<br /><br />also i used foxfarm soil and nutes but be careful... if you are using foxfarm soil they have MORE than enough nutes for a while so DO NOT FEED THEM FOR A BIT! i would normally start feeding them (giving them nutes) when the perlite in the soil turned white and not that off greenish mucky color<br /><br />and also all plants have suggested veg. times... so check online for the strains specific requirements... another thing is FLUSH! in my studies i have noticed that plants using soil almost NEVER use more than 20 % of the nutes that you give them... and that shit just stores itself in your soil which causes all kinds of problems later... i made it a point to flush them 2-3 times during veg and 2-3 times during flowering<br /><br />when it comes time to flip them into flowering, i would use the 12 hours light and 12 hours dark schedule and it never did me wrong... also be careful with using soil... MAKE SURE YOU KEEP YOUR GROW AREA CLEAN! during the flowering stage spidermites can be a pain in the ASS! so take GREAT care of your plants and they will take care of you! if you have any questions about growing then go ahead and message me and i would gladly help you!

				Ideally you want 3 rooms. Veg, flower and dry.<br /><br />If done right, you should be harvesting 300grams per fortnight.<br /><br />Plenty of information everywhere.<br /><br />Personally i&#039;d choose what strain you want, and grow a mother plant which you will then get your clones from.<br /><br /><br /><br />

As far as lights go, I have the sun &amp; two 400W general electric cool white fluoro rods. Im gonna grab some spares. Will that be efficient for lighting?
