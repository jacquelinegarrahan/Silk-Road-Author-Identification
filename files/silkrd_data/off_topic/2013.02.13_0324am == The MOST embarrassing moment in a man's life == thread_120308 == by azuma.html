				Im not talking about those awkward boners in high school. Im talking about performance anxiety, not whiskey dick but sober(well maybe a bit high and drunk) unable to &quot;erect&quot; the rocket.<br />Ive recently experienced this embarrassing moment with a very good friends cousin on an one night stand deal, which DOES NOT MAKE that situation with my friend awkward at all!! But thats not the worst part because that moment passes quickly (not quickly enough) and the chick is usually cool and neither is the morning after conversations over breakfast/lunch. The worst is attempting with another women after this amazing confidence booster. Especially in my case when i have one on the near horizon that would bang me if i remembered the first letter of her name.<br />FML<br />Any thoughts, stories or feelings<br />

				Anxiety is about the only thing that actually does stop me from getting erections... well, that and the rare occasions when I haven&#039;t slept or eaten for 3+ days, but even then I usually get them just fine -- it&#039;s maintaining them that&#039;s the problem... I don&#039;t know why anxiety does it to me when even being black out drunk or out of my skull on drugs doesn&#039;t, but if I end up self conscious I start having the same problem as you.<br /><br />... I don&#039;t really have a point.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t bother me much honestly (it&#039;s rare for me), but since you seem to be sensitive about it I thought I&#039;d point out that it isn&#039;t just you.&nbsp; Not really sure why it&#039;s so embarrassing for most guys, to be frank.&nbsp; It isn&#039;t the only part of our anatomy that can be a good time, after all.&nbsp; If you really have problems with it, you&#039;ve come to the right place -- somebody around here can help you get a little blue pill, I&#039;m sure&nbsp; :)

				So since we are all anonymous here I can jump in with too much info. Been an issue ever since I was a kid. You have any idea what it&#039;s like to be a 12 year old that can&#039;t get a hard on? Yeah, pretty fucked up. It&#039;s all mental for me. I&#039;m a player, charming as all fuck, I could talk your wife out of her panties and she&#039;d ask you to hold them, but for the love of god and all that is holy this amazing gift comes at the expense of only being able to have sex with someone that I am emotionally close to. If I can&#039;t look lovingly into her eyes, see myself spending a lifetime with her, laugh and giggle as we play in bed then my dick might as well sub for some fresh cooked spaghetti. <br /><br />Viagra helps a bit. It&#039;s not fool proof but it&#039;s way better than going solo. The other little pills not so much for me but obviously they help some people. GHB and Moxy both failed at helping me rise to the occasion.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my test for you. Watching porn, about to cum, dick hard most of the time or not? If it&#039;s not there&#039;s probably a pluming issue. If it is there&#039;s probably a relationship issue.<br /><br />If you get excited looking at other woman and stimulating yourself then there&#039;s been some breakdown in the relationship probably. Personally I&#039;d skip the Viagra and go straight to MDMA if that&#039;s the case. Can solve a decades worth of martial issues in about an hour. The shit wipes the slate clean for most people. Baggage dumped and loving can resume. The MDMA will not help you get it up of course, it actually makes that even harder while you are on it, but fuck all if it can&#039;t rekindle passion that may have been lost for a while.<br /><br />The other thing is, most guys are embarrassed to have a conversation with their girl about this stuff and most girls assume it is their fault. Even if you don&#039;t do the MDMA route, chat it up with her and let her know you are as uncomfortable with it as she is but you love her and will work through it. I just go down on my girl a lot and our relationship is solid enough that she knows how to push my buttons and get me going now. When I have the Viagra it&#039;s a sure thing but we are lovers to the core regardless of how often we have sex.

But yea the whole talking about it thing is definitely the route to go as embarrassing as it can be it just is the blatantly obvious solution. Also the right anti anxiety pill wont hurt ;D

				this happened to me with both my serious girlfriends the first time we had sex/ tried to have sex. the first sex attempt with the first gf was just fail but with the second, i thought it was fail until i stared into her eyes and thought about how much i liked her. then my guy popped right up. there&#039;s been several times i had issues with keeping it up but i think that was because i&#039;d get slightly bored or not be able to focus (possibly due to lack of sleep and/or food) or something like that. haven&#039;t had anything like that in a while though and i&#039;m having sex at least once a day normally now.

				My situation might be a little more embarrassing than all of yours..... Most of the time I can get hard, but usually I can only last about 5 minutes, then go soft, talk about ambarrassing.... Wanting so badly to give her all that she deserves, but cut short because of my own lack of stamina, complete failure :(.... Anyone have any suggestions?

Been an issue ever since I was a kid. You have any idea what it&#039;s like to be a 12 year old that can&#039;t get a hard on? Yeah, pretty fucked up. It&#039;s all mental for me. I&#039;m a player, charming as all fuck, I could talk your wife out of her panties and she&#039;d ask you to hold them, but for the love of god and all that is holy this amazing gift comes at the expense of only being able to have sex with someone that I am emotionally close to. If I can&#039;t look lovingly into her eyes, see myself spending a lifetime with her, laugh and giggle as we play in bed then my dick might as well sub for some fresh cooked spaghetti. <br /><br />Viagra helps a bit. It&#039;s not fool proof but it&#039;s way better than going solo. The other little pills not so much for me but obviously they help some people. GHB and Moxy both failed at helping me rise to the occasion.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my test for you. Watching porn, about to cum, dick hard most of the time or not? If it&#039;s not there&#039;s probably a pluming issue. If it is there&#039;s probably a relationship issue.<br /><br />If you get excited looking at other woman and stimulating yourself then there&#039;s been some breakdown in the relationship probably. Personally I&#039;d skip the Viagra and go straight to MDMA if that&#039;s the case. Can solve a decades worth of martial issues in about an hour. The shit wipes the slate clean for most people. Baggage dumped and loving can resume. The MDMA will not help you get it up of course, it actually makes that even harder while you are on it, but fuck all if it can&#039;t rekindle passion that may have been lost for a while.<br /><br />The other thing is, most guys are embarrassed to have a conversation with their girl about this stuff and most girls assume it is their fault. Even if you don&#039;t do the MDMA route, chat it up with her and let her know you are as uncomfortable with it as she is but you love her and will work through it. I just go down on my girl a lot and our relationship is solid enough that she knows how to push my buttons and get me going now. When I have the Viagra it&#039;s a sure thing but we are lovers to the core regardless of how often we have sex.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Same &quot;problem&quot; here. I can&#039;t enjoy cassual sex, I just can&#039;t... I need to feel something like love to really have a nice moment of pleassure. This can sucks and can be great at the same time, because it urges you to find someone to love and make you feel complete, you finally forget about find sex, sex and more sex, and you find something different, much better than having 300 sex partners, 2 or 3 disseases and a lot of problems related with the other genre. <br /><br />Sorry, my english sucks.

				Oral sex works for me about 98% of the time. 8)<br /><br />I went through a faze where I was having a hard time getting it up and I know it was more of a mental thing. Well now my girlfriend blows me every single time before sex, and it works!<br />To be honest I could make it work without a bj but I don&#039;t tell the gf that, I just look at it and then look at her and she goes at it. I&#039;ll never tell her my secret that I don&#039;t need a bj anymore to get it up. I think my erectile problem that I originally had was from performance anxiety but somehow time healed that and Im good now...But the gf doesn&#039;t need to know bwahahahaha ;)

I know it seems counter-intuitive to nut before getting for fuck on, but with the slippery one out of the way you can just decimate your woman. Sometimes (a lot of times) the first one is just too easy, so get it out of the way 30 minutes early or so and lay down a stable, no-surprises dicking.

I&#039;ve even been eating my girl out and came just from hearing her moan while my dick is rubbing on the bed (hard to explain), but like I said its almost like I get too excited and just can&#039;t really control it&nbsp; :-\, if I could just maintain my nut then I wouldn&#039;t even have to worry about going soft, so its not getting hard thats my problem its the fact that I can&#039;t control my nut, its very degrading.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Have you tried rubbing out the easy one before sex? I know it seems counter-intuitive to nut before getting for fuck on, but with the slippery one out of the way you can just decimate your woman. Sometimes (a lot of times) the first one is just too easy, so get it out of the way 30 minutes early or so and lay down a stable, no-surprises dicking.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sadly I&#039;ve tried this with no success.... Still can&#039;t last any longer than 5 minutes, I find eating pussy as a work of art though, I&#039;ve been told making her cum with my tongue makes up for it though, at least plan B is always a success lol
