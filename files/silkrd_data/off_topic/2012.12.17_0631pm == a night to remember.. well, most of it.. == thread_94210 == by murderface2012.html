				a perfect night i just had to share..<br /><br />&nbsp; it started with me picking up my next bag of herb from my sister.. a half ounce of some bomb ass GDP/ Green Crack hybrid.. Chronic!!<br />I&#039;m busy rolling the next blunt while she breaks out the liquid oxy-codone HCL.. meanwhile, her boyfriend is finishing up his THC butter (to make cookies n shit)...<br />&nbsp; so, we each take a dopper and a half of the oxy, eat a spoonful of pure THC butter&nbsp; ???&nbsp; and finish smoking the blunt... i take 2 THC cookies to go, and try to make it home before the oxy hits me (bad idea)..<br />&nbsp; before i get home two things happen.. the oxy hits me, and the homies are bombing my phone.. Eek a mouse is in town!! shit yea!! we goin clubbin!!<br />&nbsp; i get to the pad and start preparing for the show... joints are rolled, coke is bindled for personal use, and i pocketed 2 xanax and 4 somas for later.. Drinking some, waiting for my peeps to pick me up, i took the pills and ate the cookies..<br />&nbsp; by the time my ride got here.. i was out right faded.. <br />&nbsp; did some blow on the way to the club... waited in line... then... can&#039;t remember shit!!!<br />&nbsp; i remember little things... like dancing with this latin goddess, eek a mouse kicking ass, and the carne asada tacos i had at like 4 in the morning...<br />&nbsp;i was told today that we were also taking some blue liquid morphine er something..<br />&nbsp;all i know, i didn&#039;t touch my coke, i didn&#039;t spend all my money, i had a blast, and i&#039;m still alive!! <br />I love drugs!!
