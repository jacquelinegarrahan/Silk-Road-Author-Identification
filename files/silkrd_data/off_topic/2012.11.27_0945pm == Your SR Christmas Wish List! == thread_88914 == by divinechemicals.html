				This is probably really dumb of me, but it would be really nice if we could do a Secret Santa type thing here. :D<br /><br />Don&#039;t know how we&#039;d get past the address issue so, so the idea stalls out pretty quick lol... but... well I dunno. Just something I would love to do. :p<br /><br /><br /><br />My SR wishlist includes lots of MDMA, MDPV, some ganja butter to make treats for my friends, and that sexy fake Gucci necklace that Chinese vendor sells!

				I actually LOVE the Secret Santa idea.<br /><br />What if all the participants picked four (or whatever number) vendors they would love to receive from and posted the PGP key of their addresses for each vendor? We could all randomly get assigned a person, be given a bitcoin max. budget, look at their chosen vendors and when we find something we want to send them, we could copy and paste the key into the address field of the chosen vendor. The keys can only be decrypted by the vendors and everyone could remain anonymous. And the vendors could keep track of who placed orders by a deadline, if so-an-so didn&#039;t pitch in to secret santa, than he doesn&#039;t get his gift and the coins get released back to the buyer. Or they could just give their address and get the goodies instead. Does this all make sense? lol Oh well<br /><br />Good vibes all 8)

I fucking love secret santa!! please please. It dosent have to be everyone if they dont want, but like 4 people would be enough. I&#039;m sure there are 4 people that would be willing. shitwassocash start it as a new thread! we can get people to sign up to now. <br /><br />How about, everyone puts there names in the thread ok, we set a maximum BTC limit that everyone can afford! we get someone really trustworthy, mod or long time vendor to assign people up into pairs without telling them and we all send them our PGP encrypted addresses clearly stating who we are.&nbsp; each one of us gives the mod the same fee for helping like 1BTC or something. We chose a product and inform the mod via link to the product transfer him&amp;her the BTC for the purchase and he sends on the address encrypted with their public key and makes the purchase. As long as its a really trusted mod theres no security issue, we dont know each others address and we just link the mod the thing that we want to buy the other person directly so no confusion.

				You know, I was all set to grow shrooms when I found SR, and now can&#039;t risk having any sort of thing like that happening at my place of residence (which is a shame). So a safe, reliable, domestic shroom vendor would be a godsend.<br /><br />That and fuzzy slippers. Giant fuzzy slippers, those ones like gorillas or hedgehogs or whatever. My feet are always cold.
