				Jeffery; A cocktail of drugs rolled up in a joint that includes, pot, heroin, bits of e, methodone, and angel dust.<br /><br />Apparently it&#039;s a whole bunch of shit rolled into a blunt but the thing is most of it is not even active when smoked like that, it was just made popular from a movie. Obviously people with any damn sense have never done shit like this because it&#039;s a complete waste of perfectly good drugs.

				A Jeffery is a fictional preparation which includes every known traditional (older) drug wrapped in a weed joint.<br /><br />According to the movie it&#039;s from, it includes acid, cocaine, ecstasy, herion, and obviously weed, and possibly other drugs such as DMT sandwiched inside the joint.<br /><br />The movie that referenced it was about this record company employee who is a complete nerd who proposes to his boss, a rapper, to invite this rock star to agree to a record deal.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Needless to say, the nerd is given the &quot;Jeffery&quot; by the rock star, who may or may not be strung out on heroin.

				Thanks Ray.<br />&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know that&#039;s where it&#039;s from.&nbsp; It would be so much better if it was meth, weed, heroin (black tar), coke, and shit like that .&nbsp; Ther must be a cocktail out there that is cool to smoke together.&nbsp; Weed and coke are nice together.&nbsp; Meth tastes like plastic so it ruins everything taste wise .<br />

				pot heroin and PCP are all active when smoked. Smoking an E tab is going to be a complete waste of time, it might be possible to smoke MDMA crystal in some form but I have no idea, not sure on methodone either but smoking pills is a waste of time and stupid.

				Yea its basically smoking a joint/blunt with weed pcp and alittle heroin.&nbsp; Basically a waste of time i would rather smoke a blunt followed by a bump of heroin and maybe some mdma after the H is waring off.&nbsp; Havent tried pcp so wouldnt really know what that would contribute. Overall a waste of a lot of drugs IMO

				Glad to see their are smart enough people on here to know that, with the drugs listed, it wouldn&#039;t really work that well. I&#039;ve heard so many people over the years that just smoked some really good weed then try to tell people it was laced with acid after they freak out. Fucken retards...<br /><br />anyways...... How was it?

They would suck that syrup up through the blunt then they would microwave the shit dry. They would smoke on this blunt choking after every hit, coughing shit up for like 45 minutes and swear they were fucked up. <br /><br />Which they probably were fucked up from the lack of oxygen going to their brain from choking for almost a hour, lol..
