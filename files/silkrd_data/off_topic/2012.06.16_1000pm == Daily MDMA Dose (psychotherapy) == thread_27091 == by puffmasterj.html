				I&#039;ve had this thought for some time. I believe when MDMA was first marketed it was used as an anti-depressant? Does anybody know what that dose range was? Erowid reports the threshold at 30mg. If one where you use a daily dose of it, perhaps between 30 and 45mg&nbsp; what do you suppose the repercussions would be? I did some light research but couldn&#039;t find any studies operating in such a low dose range, I found the usual 100mg + being utilized in their studies.<br /><br />I know there is something about this drug from experience (obv) and some reading online, but I don&#039;t know much about it&#039;s application to psychotherapy if anybody can&#039;t point me in the right direction. <br /><br />I guess I&#039;ll end with a little anecdotal story. I dated this girl, who had been on anti-depressants her whole life. One weekend we got away and rented a cabin, rolled the whole time. She had such a wonderful experience--Hasn&#039;t used anti-depressants since, and has been extremely happy and upbeat every day (it&#039;s now been about 7 months) Such a powerful, beautiful substance. ah. :)

				I doubt daily use would really be good in a long run. However, I hope with all my heart that in the future, substances like MDMA and Ketamine will be mored used in therapy as they have a lot of potential

				It&#039;s too neurotoxic to be taken daily. I&#039;ve tried this for a while and ended up having what I can only describe as &#039;brain wobbles&#039; every hour or so. A kind of passing out feeling like a mini seizure and intense pain which lasts a few seconds. You stop feeling the effects after about a week too and get bad skin.<br /><br />Something like 2C-B is better if you&#039;re going to take small doses regularly. Same MDMA effect but not as up down up down and intense, with more anti-depressant properties and no crash.

				When Shulgin repopularized MDMA, he intended for it to be used therapeutically. I suppose you could call it an anti-depressant, but not in the traditional &quot;pop one every day and mask the effects of your depression&quot;, more in the &quot;lets use this substance to address the root causes of your depression/anxiety/what have you&quot;. It really is an amazing substance - such a shame its scheduled. I can&#039;t wait for the day that its accepted for therapeutic use. But its something that should be used sparingly. I think the real therapeutic effects don&#039;t get flushed out until say a 120mg dose (what Shulgin recommended for therapy), and hands down that&#039;s not something you should take every day. I would really discourage regular (i.e. daily) use of any psychedelic - but again, just my opinion. There&#039;s a book I read recently that addressed this topic, if I can remember the name I&#039;ll post it here!

Is there anybody to MDMA as maybe Tim Leary is to LSD? I remember reading something about Leary&#039;s experiments with convicts--having a significantly lower recidivism rate as actual prisoners.
