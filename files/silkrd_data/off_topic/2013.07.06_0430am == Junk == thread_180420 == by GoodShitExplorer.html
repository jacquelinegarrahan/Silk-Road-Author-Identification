The philosopher Rene Descartes was troubled by the idea that in fact all his sensory information could be being fed him by a malevolent demon.....in fact even these worrying thoughts could be being planted in his head by the same mischevious imp. However, he reasoned, even the most cunning demon could not make him believe he existed if he in fact did not exist.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore the only thing he could be sure of was that he existed. &quot;Cogito ergo sum: I think therefore I am&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After annoying everyone by posting this all over the internet he then went on to embarrass himself further by claiming that:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God, if he existed, must be perfect.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But a God that didn&#039;t exist would be less perfect than one that did.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, God must exist.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not only was this clearly somewhat flawed reasoning, it wasn&#039;t even his original idea, having been originally propounded by St. Augustine(or someone) who at least had the excuse of living in the dark ages when you could get away with this kind of woolly thinking (like the Philosophy section of SR).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rene Descartes was ruined and his estate consumed by the legal case brought by St Augustine(or someone&#039;s) lawyers .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately it turned out that it was all an illusion created by a malevolent daemon (going with the cooler spelling this time) and so none of this mattered.

No.<br />Do I believe we are tapped into an &#039;existence&#039; run by a force that is merely incomprehensible to the human mind? Absolutely.<br /><br />My only quarrel with religion, is that it seeks a tangible representation of a realm beyond the physical world. Divine are not the words of man, and only man would dream up a &quot;place&quot; called Heaven. <br />In the reality of the incomprehensible, there IS no real order. As when we exist outside of our physical world, we are not physical beings with physical memories. We are merely energy. We are absolute chaos.<br /><br />The truly remarkable thing(that is often overlooked) is that we are anything at all. Let alone something aware of itself.<br /><br />If &quot;you only live once&quot; were true, my friends, then we would be denying the Universe it&#039;s due credit as the best &#039;recycling plant&#039; of all.
