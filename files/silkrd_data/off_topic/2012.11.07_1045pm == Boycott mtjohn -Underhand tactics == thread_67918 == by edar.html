He may be a despicable creature, but he deserves the same protection as the rest of us. In the meantime, I think it is perfectly acceptable to encourage others to boycott his products as said boycott is coming about as a direct result of his actions. At the very least it will encourage buyers to think twice before spending their Bitcoin with someone who employs such disgusting tactics.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

Silk Road would indeed be a much better place without mtljohn, both as a business and a community, but we cannot pick and choose whose anonymity we will protect. It must be all or nothing, otherwise we abandon our principles and become broken because of it.<br /><br />I would certainly be concerned if I had ordered from mtljohn in the past - his mannerisms and behaviour greatly concern me, but there is no evidence that he has done anything wrong where deletion of buyer&#039;s information is concerned. He is a snake though, and I wouldn&#039;t put anything past him when it comes to gaining advantage over someone (whether that be a competitor, or a buyer who leaves negative feedback).<br /><br />- grahamgreene

In fact in a PM you stated the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=31858">Quote from: mtljohn on November 07, 2012, 01:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">anyways bro... come check me on SR for your M39 needs.. I take care of my clients and we can srart a new clean slate as of now....<br /><br />Either way please understand that I am no rat and I wont be talked shit to.... you may not like that but it does not affect that way i conduct my business transactions which all go smoothly! <br /><br />Hope to talk to you soon...<br /><br />John<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You state you will sell to me, then you state you won&#039;t. More lies!<br /><br />I have also stated that I will follow mrouid and continue my business with him wherever he decides to go, whether that be Silk Road or elsewhere. He has not asked me nor instructed me to do so and as a buyer, I have signed no contract, nor agreed to any terms stating that I would not do so meaning that I am free to do just that.<br />So yes, if I can no longer buy from mrouid on Silk Road, I will buy from him elsewhere. I would rather buy from him here, giving Silk Road its commission as I feel very strongly for the cause behind this place, but I won&#039;t stand for an injustice. This is not just a place to buy drugs, mtljohn. It is a statement of freedom, and a refuge from the rotten society we live in. A society plagued by people like you.<br /><br />What I will do with my growing business is none of your concern; however, to put your mind at ease and soften the concern you have for me, I will either buy from mrouid wherever he ends up, or I will return to sourcing my product from my previous real life suppliers. If I do the latter I&#039;ll be buying be slightly inferior product at a slightly higher price, but c&#039;est la vie. It won&#039;t affect me all that much, apart from slightly decreasing my profit margin. Thanks for your concern though.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67918.msg573048#msg573048">Quote from: GreenGiant on November 08, 2012, 02:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Pretty sure if he wanted to deal with(which i am sure he does not) then he could find away, he is much smarter than you&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I appreciate the vote of confidence, GreenGiant.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />- grahamgreene

In fact in a PM you stated the following:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=31858">Quote from: mtljohn on November 07, 2012, 01:44 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Either way please understand that I am no rat and I wont be talked shit to.... you may not like that but it does not affect that way i conduct my business transactions which all go smoothly! <br /><br />Hope to talk to you soon...<br /><br />John<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You state you will sell to me, then you state you won&#039;t. More lies!<br /><br />I have also stated that I will follow mrouid and continue my business with him wherever he decides to go, whether that be Silk Road or elsewhere. He has not asked me nor instructed me to do so and as a buyer, I have signed no contract, nor agreed to any terms stating that I would not do so meaning that I am free to do just that.<br />So yes, if I can no longer buy from mrouid on Silk Road, I will buy from him elsewhere. I would rather buy from him here, giving Silk Road its commission as I feel very strongly for the cause behind this place, but I won&#039;t stand for an injustice. This is not just a place to buy drugs, mtljohn. It is a statement of freedom, and a refuge from the rotten society we live in. A society plagued by people like you.<br /><br />What I will do with my growing business is none of your concern; however, to put your mind at ease and soften the concern you have for me, I will either buy from mrouid wherever he ends up, or I will return to sourcing my product from my previous real life suppliers. If I do the latter I&#039;ll be buying be slightly inferior product at a slightly higher price, but c&#039;est la vie. It won&#039;t affect me all that much, apart from slightly decreasing my profit margin. Thanks for your concern though.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67918.msg573048#msg573048">Quote from: GreenGiant on November 08, 2012, 02:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Pretty sure if he wanted to deal with(which i am sure he does not) then he could find away, he is much smarter than you&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I appreciate the vote of confidence, GreenGiant.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />fuck off.. i told you to come check me when you apoligized to me in a pm you sent me for making a wrong decision... do you remember what you said??

				@grahamgreene <br />I honestly picture you as a calm, wise and intellectual man. He will never read or take in consideration your constructive arguments. He is limited, he can not accomplish more from this life. Contrary to popular belief karma is not a bitch and among with time will fix this situation that appears to have affected a honest, down to earth vendor. I&#039;ve never bought anything from any of the vendors involved in this &quot;conflict&quot; but for some reason I picture this john as a big pile of shit...

I still have a lot to learn in life, as do we all.&nbsp; :)<br />It&#039;s true that mtljohn is too hung up on getting people to believe his fabrication; if he takes the views of others into consideration and ackowledges their points as being valid, his fabrication becomes evident as just that - a fabrication.<br /><br />Haha, I agree, karma&#039;s not a bitch - but people do get back out of life what they put into it. mrouid will survive and continue his business in one capacity or another, and mtljohn&#039;s plan of &quot;stealing his customers&quot; won&#039;t come to fruition. Not only will he fail to attract new business, I&#039;m certain that upon seeing how he has carried himself here, he will lose customers of his own. As I&#039;ve said before, I&#039;ve been here quite a long time and I&#039;ve seen vendors just like mtljohn come and go more times than I care to remember - always leaving a black stain on the heart of this community. We, our community, will survive, of course. As for mtljohn - his fate will be determined by the effort he has put into constructing his own demise.<br /><br />You should consider a purchase from mrouid if you&#039;re interested in dealing with a truly professional vendor. There&#039;s a reason that his clients are defending him so vehemently - we value him so much because he makes it clear by his professionalism, his packaging methods and his communication that he genuinely values us, his customers, above all else. He wouldn&#039;t be where he is without us, and he realises and values that. mtljohn, however, does not. He thinks that people should value him rather than the other way around. That will ultimately be his downfall.<br /><br />- grahamgreene
