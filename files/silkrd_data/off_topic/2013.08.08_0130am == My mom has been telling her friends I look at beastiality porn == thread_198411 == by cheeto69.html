				I posted this in Newbie discussion a few days ago but since I now have over 50 posts I&#039;d like to seek the input of the greater SR community.<br /><br />A few days ago my friend told me that he had been told by his mom that my mom had caught me looking at beastiality porn. My friend inquired further and found out that my mom had told my friend&#039;s mom this when they were drunk and with a bunch of other friends.<br /><br />This would be one thing if I had a serious beastiality porn problem... but I don&#039;t. I haven&#039;t, ever. I&#039;ve seen glimpses of horsedicks on reddit.com/r/wtf but that&#039;s about it. I have no idea where she got this from, and even worse I have no idea why she would be telling her friends about&nbsp; it. Especially to the mother of one of my best friends. Like, does that seem normal to you? If your mom told your best friend&#039;s mom that she caught you looking at beastiality porn, does that seem like something that would ever fit into daily conversation?<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit pissed because while my friend just found it funny as opposed to making fun of me for watching beastiality porn, my mom still went and told a bunch of people that I watch beastiality porn. Which isn&#039;t true. My friend is definitely not making this up either. Other than this my family is entirely normal, and my parents think fairly highly of me. I&#039;m also not sure why I&#039;m posting this here. I just need to post it somewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been planning to confront my mom about this but I have no idea how. &quot;Hey mom... so why you telling people I look at beastiality porn?&quot; just seems like a really awkward conversation. But if I don&#039;t do anything, what if she gets hammered again and tells this to more people I know?<br /><br />...thoughts?

				Step 1: Stop looking at beastiality porn.<br /><br />Step 2: Repeat step one (kidding :))<br /><br />Seriously though, not much you can do but confront, and if you did ever look at something even harmless that would give her that indication, I would be more concerned with how she knows??? Since obviously you use your computer for other purposes as well...<br /><br />Good luck

				I&#039;d suggest a very gentle approach to dealing with this.<br /><br />When you mother has her friends over again, go over and sit quietly amongst them, don&#039;t say anything....keep your head down in a sheepish kind of way.<br /><br />Then as your mothers gets up to move....dash over and start humping her leg, like a dog possessed.<br /><br />1. You&#039;ll be the star of the day.<br />2. Her friends will love you.<br />3. Your mother will never...repeat never...say anything untoward about you again.<br />4.

				I feel like this &#039;awkward conversation&#039; is a pretty small con to getting this hashed out. Just talk to her about it, man. Nothing wrong with honesty. Put the cards on the table, don&#039;t assume anything, and let her tell you what she did or didn&#039;t say. Good luck man!

				Well if this happened to me I would talk to my mother in a way that would put her into guilt. Something maybe like:<br />-Really mother, you thought I liked this kind of porn and never thought about talking to me and maybe try helping me with this problem? So you didn&#039;t say anything and just made fun of me with your friends and embarrassing me without even being sure that such problem exists... Wow I couldn&#039;t expect a worst reaction from you mother. I am a bit disappointed...&quot;<br /><br />Or something like this. If you just tell her that you don&#039;t like beastiality porn there is a chance that she will not believe you. So play with your expressions. She will love you anything you say. Just try and make her think about how special you are for her.<br /><br />Maybe silly advice but that is what I would have done.<br /><br />Take care my friend.<br /><br />Adamiz<br /><br />P.S. I really laughed with johnybones reply! haha

				use photoshop to make it look like your mom is getting fucked by a horse/dog. Then distribute the pic to all of her friends! make sure to send the pics stealth with postage paid for in cash. you dont want any recourse from the police! then delte photoshop from your computer so she doesnt put 2 and 2 together.

				First check with your friend&#039;s mother she really did tell your friend that you like animal porn. (It isn&#039;t something that mother&#039;s usually talk to their sons about.) If it&#039;s true, then that&#039;s as good as having permission; so take advantage of it! You might as well be hung for watching full on bestiality with dogs, snakes, ducks etc as hung for a brief glimpse of a horse&#039;s cock.

				I would like to reiterate that I do not in fact watch animal porn. Also, she isn&#039;t telling people I have sex with animals, she&#039;s telling people I watch animal porn.

				Not to sound like a douche, but your mom sounds like an attention whore. Why the fuck else would she say that? I know people like that who just make up crazy fuckin stories to get attention. I bet you this wasn&#039;t the first thing shes said about you.<br /><br />How old you are depends on what you do. If you&#039;re older I would definitely flip the fuck out on her and call her out on her bullshit. She&#039;s defiling your name for her own amusement. If you&#039;re younger you might not understand this yet.<br /><br />Only you can really judge how to handle the situation my friend, since you know your mom the best.<br /><br />I apologize if this comes as a great shock to you about your mother if this is the first time you&#039;ve caught her in her bullshit.<br /><br /><br />P.S. I would go to the source of the fodder, your friend&#039;s mom. ASK her in person if thats what your mom said. Because if your friend is actually lying, or your friend&#039;s mom is lying then shit could turn real ugly.<br /><br />To keep quiet would be the real mistake here. One of those 3 people are lying and you have to figure out who.

My friend inquired further and found out that my mom had told my friend&#039;s mom this when they were drunk and with a bunch of other friends.<br /><br />This would be one thing if I had a serious beastiality porn problem... but I don&#039;t. I haven&#039;t, ever. I&#039;ve seen glimpses of horsedicks on reddit.com/r/wtf but that&#039;s about it. I have no idea where she got this from, and even worse I have no idea why she would be telling her friends about&nbsp; it. Especially to the mother of one of my best friends. Like, does that seem normal to you? If your mom told your best friend&#039;s mom that she caught you looking at beastiality porn, does that seem like something that would ever fit into daily conversation?<br /><br />I&#039;m a bit pissed because while my friend just found it funny as opposed to making fun of me for watching beastiality porn, my mom still went and told a bunch of people that I watch beastiality porn. Which isn&#039;t true. My friend is definitely not making this up either. Other than this my family is entirely normal, and my parents think fairly highly of me. I&#039;m also not sure why I&#039;m posting this here. I just need to post it somewhere.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been planning to confront my mom about this but I have no idea how. &quot;Hey mom... so why you telling people I look at beastiality porn?&quot; just seems like a really awkward conversation. But if I don&#039;t do anything, what if she gets hammered again and tells this to more people I know?<br /><br />...thoughts?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ok bro, here is the deal. Obviously your mother has no respect for her own child or herself.<br />My example is if my mother told people I was looking at beast porn, whether it is true or not, how does that make the mother look?<br />Say you were a rapist (god forbid anyone being a rapist) I would feel comfortable with the assumption that a mother would not go around advertising her son is a rapist.<br />Now I know there is a huge difference in beast porn and being a rapist, but I think you get my point.<br />People are going to ask &quot;well if your son watches that shit, what the hell did you do to screw up his head?&quot;<br /><br />I would not have an issue with confronting my mother about this AT ALL! She is trying to tarnish her own damn sons reputation. That is just unacceptable!<br /><br />Do you treat your mother good? are you respectful? How you treat her are important variables in this situation as well. <br /><br />If I went around bad mouthing my mother all the time, I would expect the same in return. So perhaps you have not been the greatest son lately?<br /><br />Then of course there is always the option to say to her something along the lines of: &quot;Mom if you don&#039;t stop telling people these things, I am going to tell people I caught you sucking the family dogs dick.&quot;<br /><br />I am quite high right now, so work with me 8)

				Hi guys. Still here, haven&#039;t talked to my mom yet.

This gets the message across without you having to bring up the subject in conversation, and your mom&#039;s reaction may give you a clue as to her role in the slurring of your good character.

				Those of you who have been following my journey will be glad to know that I have an update.<br /><br />I confronted my mom when she came to say goodnight to me, and it wasn&#039;t as awkward as I expected it to be. I explained to her what my friend had told me, and asked her if she had told people I watched beastiality porn. She was pretty surprised and repeatedly insisted she hadn&#039;t done anything like that. Her initial idea was that she had made a joke referencing the time me and my friend got caught watching porn in first grade, but that wouldn&#039;t have made much sense because I don&#039;t know how anyone would mishear &quot;caught him watching porn with his friend in first grade&quot; with &quot;caught him watching beastiality&quot;. Anyways, she seemed to feel pretty bad that I had heard she said that, and repeatedly insisted she would never say anything like that. Which in my mind is true, my family usually doesn&#039;t go gossiping about each other like that. I said that I believed her and she left.<br /><br />About five minutes later she came back, and I guess while she was gone she told my dad what I had asked her. My dad&#039;s theory, who was also there on the night that they were hammered and my mom allegedly told people I was watching beastiality, was that my mom said something in a sarcastic way, and my friend&#039;s mom took it seriously. This is plausible, because my friend&#039;s mom is Asian with a heavy Chinese accent and isn&#039;t very good at sarcasm. My family is also pretty sarcastic. Unfortunately my dad was even more drunk than my mom was that night so he wasn&#039;t able to recall very well whether or not that would have happened. All this information was relayed back to me by my mom. Maybe I&#039;ll ask my dad about it later to double check. Anyways, I told my mom I believed her and she left again.<br /><br />So for now I&#039;m not sure what to think. My mother denied it and gave me a plausible explanation as to why my friend&#039;s mom may have said that, but I don&#039;t know why she would joke about me watching beastiality. That seems like a pretty weird thing to joke about. At this point the only option I can think of to get further information is ask my friend&#039;s mom, but I don&#039;t know when I would ever get an opportunity to ask her, plus that sounds like a horrifically awkward conversation. The search for the truth is tough...

				This thread blows my mind. I doubt my mother would even know bestiality porn exists.<br /><br />BTW, when I first read your nick I thought it read &quot;cheetah 69&quot;. You sure that wasn&#039;t a Freudian slip. :D

But upon reflection she misjudged her audience and now she&#039;s quite genuinely horrified that you found out.<br /><br />Well all&#039;s well that ends well, although the finger of suspicion now rests on your mom and dad - who clearly both think bestiality porn is a laughing matter. Methinks a certain couple got hold of a VHS copy of Animal Farm back in the day...*Taps nose*
