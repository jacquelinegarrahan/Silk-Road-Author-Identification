				There&#039;s a listing for a jet on there, pretty cheap too. I guess it&#039;d be nice for escaping to your secret volcano island on a budget, but I can&#039;t really see any other reason why you&#039;d need to buy one from SR.

				The Nazi hat for $10,000 sketched me out the most, lol. <br /><br />This listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/702f8a14be makes me wonder if that&#039;s the highest $$ amount SR will let you list for...it&#039;s such a random number.<br /><br />Using this: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/796ce882cf would be the definition of sketchy, lol.
