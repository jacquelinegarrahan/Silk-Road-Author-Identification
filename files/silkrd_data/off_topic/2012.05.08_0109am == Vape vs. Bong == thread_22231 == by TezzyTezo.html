				The most efficient is a gravity in my opinion although I have a vaporizer and it is amazing.&nbsp; Vapes use a lot more but you can recycle the dried remnants and make butter with it.&nbsp; There&#039;s still enough THC to re-use.

				Vape is the best way to save cannabis and if you&#039;re really bumming it you can save up all of the leftover vape weed you have and turn it into edibles. Not only is it awesome for saving weed but it&#039;s healthier too since you&#039;re not inhaling any smoke.

				I like my vape because of less smell, healthier, and it&#039;s pretty efficient. It isn&#039;t as hard hitting as a bong rip, but will get me higher in the long run because of how much a bong will burn through so fast. <br /><br />I recently started doing buckets/gravity bongs and that shit will save you some weed but it&#039;s not the most comfortable or convenient way of smoking imo.

				I love me a good vaporizer, and I don&#039;t think you can get any more efficient. Maybe a medical vaporizer with water filtration added. <br />My lungs feel soo much better after switching over.<br />+1 on the Arizer, MFLB, Vaporgenie (bat) and Vaporstar as well&nbsp; 8)<br />Gotta have choices for diff situations

				Vapes are nice, I could never see myself using them all the time though.&nbsp; Enjoy actually smoking herb too much.<br /><br />These days for bongs I shy away from the big ones.&nbsp; Only smoke scientific glass for the most part...&nbsp; Toro and liesure glass are my favorite brands.&nbsp; Have several oil rigs, including and hmk rig for the oil/wax/icewax...
