				Was thinking about finding drugs - and recently I helped a buddy do a renovation on some old cottage and we found drugs!<br /><br />As for who owned them, we presume that due to it being rented for weekends that people partied. <br /><br />The owner does not do drugs, in fact, we had to sneak a sly joint as he was some kind of anti-drug lunatic. <br /><br />The drugs! - We found a few things. Firstly, some hash, looked like Afghan, and over 14 grams and a nice smoke&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Then we found what looked like coke - but my buddy dabbed it, informed me it was bitter and in his opinion it was heroin but could be some RC. He washed his mouth out right away in case it was some RC active at small doses/ It was heroin, so, sad though it seems, we flushed it. Must have been over a gram - white not brown. <br /><br />Best find was Roche Valium! Blister packaged, expiry date cool, and they were only 2mg but we got 70+<br /><br />Also we found one E tablet - but, that was flushed. If we need E, we know that SR has crystal and we know what we are taking and what dose. <br /><br />So, I thought that was a nice find! Nothing really great like kilos of coke floating in the sea but still we got a gift!<br /><br />The hash was best for me. But we split it 50/50. <br /><br />Also &#039;found&#039; a few plants growing outdoors, but I leave them because, usually its obvious someone has planted it on purpose. I might snip a bud, but never steal the plant. Easy to plant&nbsp; few outdoors and more people do this. Some plant a lot outdoors but GPS the locations, visit them and some camp out for harvest time. Its a working holiday but fun all the same.<br /><br />So, maybe nobody has any good stories, but everyone has found something! So, if you have, tell us what it was, how much!<br /><br />I&#039;d like someone to maybe find bales of weed floating on the sea near the beach! A dream of mine! You would need to hide them - come back with a van and obviously take a chance! <br /><br />Fin ding a joint even, that&#039;s something. <br /><br />Always finding lines of shit UK coke on toilets! Many clubs now spray WD40 on surfaces people use! So be careful there.<br /><br />And happy new year!<br /><br />Plus, who has free samples out there these days? <br /><br />After my find I feel lucky. I&#039;m hoping for free hash samples I guess - not begging, I got my own hash and bud! But, maybe someone has some REAL nice Afghan. This is clean stuff - nice enough, but more 8/10 hash than the classic 10/10 hash of atlas2012. Now that is hash! True hash and fair trade hash! So, buy that fair trade! The farmers deserve more dolars and their children need new shoes and laptops and so on.<br /><br />Cheers!&nbsp; &nbsp;;D
