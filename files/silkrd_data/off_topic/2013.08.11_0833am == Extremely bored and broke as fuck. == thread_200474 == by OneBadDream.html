				I can&#039;t fall asleep, I&#039;m broke as shit, I&#039;m bored as shit. While this may seem really pessimistic, I&#039;m sure we can all agree it&#039;s never a good feeling to lend a family member money and then they never pay you back. Man... I must be a sucker. Not the first time either.<br /><br />I always give him the benefit of the doubt too. Him: &quot;Yo can I borrow like $140 from you. I&#039;ll pay you back tomorrow for it.&quot; {goes into thought bubble}.... *Agh.. fack! &gt;.&lt; Here we go again.. I just got paid motherfucker.. Keep it cool... let jesus take the wheel... I mean, he&#039;s my brother. He wouldn&#039;t fuck me over, right?*<br /><br />Me: &quot;Yeah sure man ^_^&quot;<br />Him: &quot;Thanks. I reallyyy appreciate it. I&#039;ll pay you back, I promise.&quot;<br />{Thought bubble} *What you said last time fucker..*<br />Me: &quot;I know, it&#039;s all good.&quot;<br /><br />A week later....<br /><br />Calls bro*<br /><br />Voicemail.<br /><br />Calls bro*<br /><br />Voicemail.<br /><br />Calls dad because he works with bro*<br /><br />Dad: &quot;Hey, son. What&#039;s up?&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Not much. What&#039;s up with ------? He&#039;s not answering my calls at all?&quot;<br />Dad: &quot;I don&#039;t know. He hasn&#039;t been coming to work for the past three days. He&#039;s all crapped out on those suboxone.&quot;<br />{Thought bubble} *You son of a bitch, I fucking knew it.*<br />Me: &quot;Wow, okay... uhm. Alright. Can you tell him to get a hold of me?&quot;<br />Dad: &quot;Yeah&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Alright, thanks. Bye.<br /><br />Smh.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now. 1.) I&#039;m trying my best to not be salty, but my brother gets paid WAY more than I do and he&#039;s just fucking it up.<br />2.) He lies to me all the god damn time.<br />3.) I&#039;m a sucker with a soft heart for family.<br /><br />End of rant.

				The last time I let any of my family members borrow cash from me was in 2010.<br />I was going to college and (idiotically, I know) I let my mom borrow the last of my money that was supposed to be for tuition to &quot;pay rent&quot;.<br />She gambled it all away the same night and nearly caused us to become homeless. She was able to make up the money again, but she never payed me. Not the worst thing she&#039;s done though...<br /><br />Fuck that. I let no one borrow cash.

				What you said The Missus! I used to be a sucker and let people borrow.... never again. I had a friend that owed me 50 bucks for almost a year before he paid it back, he told me he sent it a couple times, and thinking that I had money on the way I accidently overdrew my bank account, sufficient to say the money never arrived although he &quot;sent&quot; it. He tells me shit im sorry I hate oweing people money and i&#039;ll get you back twice as much since you had to pay overdraft fee, he pays me back the original 50 and conveniently forgot about the extra. He since has tried to borrow and is repeatedly told nah no thanks, really not a friend when you pull shit like that.

				Yeah, I can honestly say that the quality of my life has gotten better once I stopped lending money.
