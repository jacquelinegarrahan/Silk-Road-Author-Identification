				Basically an apartment or flat that you own. From wiki : The difference between a condominium and an apartment complex is purely legal: there is no way to know a condominium from an apartment simply by looking at or visiting the building. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. The same building developed as a condominium (and sold in individual units to different owners) could actually be built someplace else as an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and rent individual units to different tenants). As a practical matter, though, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets.

				The difference is ownership. You can buy a condo but can only rent an apartment (you&#039;ll still have monthly fees but will be cheaper than renting). And if you buy a house-like condo, you are subject to rules that define how you can paint your home or decorate your lawn. They can be multi stories or one floor, it doesn&#039;t really matter. <br /><br />The owner can also rent out their living space so if you are seeing these up for rent, you&#039;ll be renting from a single person rather than a corporation or a manager.

The difference is you can own a condo, but you rent an apartment (at least where i live, this may be different elsewhere). Also, don&#039;t confuse condos with townhouses. Townhouses are also multi-resident properties, but when you buy a townhouse you also own a tiny piece of land, when you buy a condo you only own the inside part of the space. All of the owners pay a monthly fee for upkeep to the outside part of the space.

				I think when they use it in the E.U it&#039;s just like an interchangeable word for apartment because I&#039;m looking to buy but some of the listings I am taking a butchers at say &quot;apartment&quot; some say &quot;condo&quot; and some say &quot;condominium&quot; so I think it&#039;s just either them trying to sound cool and American (fail there, we are European and therefore much cooler than Americans by default) or it&#039;s American&#039;s that have moved over to these places and are using their crazy lingo when they should have turned at least English by now. I think it&#039;s the latter actually because the site itself is very, let&#039;s say cheesy and quite Americanly written.

				Condos are def an American thing, but many of the US properties are now owned by big, international companies, especially if they are in a vacation area like Hawaii or Florida. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they had some American real estate &quot;expert&quot; handling the marketing for them. American realtors are the worst marketers ever, they write horrible copy, use too many exclamation points!!!! and take shoddy pics.

				OK, I&#039;m going to threadjack just a bit - I agree, I love Gordon Ramsey, by far my all-time favorite TV food dude. I watch all his shows. Then I got BBC America and got to see his UK shows. They are, in my opinion, way better than the US shows. You really get to see more than one side of his personality. Over here all his shows are based on &quot;FUCK OFF YA TWIT,&quot; when in reality there is a lot more to him than the ability to cuss someone out and make awesome food.

				Yeah that&#039;s what I mean Brutusk, Hell&#039;s Kitchen U.K it&#039;s more about the food and you get Gordon or the other guy that was on it getting pissed off but it&#039;s not the focus. In the American one it&#039;s almost as though you have to accompany these people on some sort of life-changing and soul confirming story and it&#039;s chopped full of Saving Private Ryan moments where they all pull together and get the job done with music that I am 99% sure that is pulled out of Saving Private Ryan as well. No need for it at all. I swear no wonder some Americans have this self-deluded idea that their country is some sort of holy land because your media stuffs that shit in your head subliminally. The silly thing is about it is that I don&#039;t even think Americans really want that shit and it contributes to things like the shootings that happen at Batman because it makes people crack the fuck out. <br /><br />Oh yeah and Brutusk now that you said you watch BBC America I would definitely be gay with you and enter a same-sex marriage with you.

				Stay away from Condos,Condominiums,Town Houses they are a money trap. The maintenance group or association charge you a monthly fee that you have no say in. The fee can be for anything they want: lets just say the maintenance association also owns another building 2KM away and they want to remodel it plus put in a new swimming pool. You now have to pay for remolding and a pool that has nothing to do with you and you cant use the pool.
