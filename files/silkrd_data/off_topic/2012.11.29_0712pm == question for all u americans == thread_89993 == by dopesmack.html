				I guess I don&#039;t take issue with that one little thing in particular - I mean, that would be some moronic-level limitation to be sure, on par with there being a rule that if you asked a cop their favourite colour, they absolutely have to say &quot;burgundy&quot;. J&#039;accuse!<br /><br />To add a slight caveat to the &quot;can say whatever they want&quot;, there are some restrictions when it comes to entrapment, but they vary from state to state (if you&#039;re in the U.S.) and are really far too unpredictable to take any comfort from. So, theoretically, a cop can&#039;t tell you *anything* (and then arrest you) but practically, yeah, they can do whatever they want. And they can absolutely tell you that they are 100%, can&#039;t-believe-you&#039;d-even-say-that-man-I-hate-cops-a-cop-killed-my-cousin, not a cop.

				I don&#039;t hate cops. I don&#039;t hate anybody. Cops are humans just like us and they most likely get high too. I hate the war on drugs and the scum back politicians. Cops are just doing their job, just like soldiers. You don&#039;t hate soldiers, just because the moron politicians send them to baseless wars. Either way, I have more balanced approach to this. If cops have found their way to this forum it is of up most importance to be able to profile them as such.

Spending (a lot of) time on the forums, it&#039;s starting to look like I&#039;m one of the more paranoid people on here, but my perspective is that there is no way LE *haven&#039;t* made it here and are pretending to be buyers and/or vendors. I mean, why wouldn&#039;t they? The fact that the forums haven&#039;t descended into one giant witch hunt of mutual overlapping accusations is kind of amazing. I think there&#039;s just kind of a mutual understanding that there&#039;s no point going down that road.
