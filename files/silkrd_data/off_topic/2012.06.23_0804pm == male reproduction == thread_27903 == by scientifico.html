				This is ridiculous<br /><br />And yeah, give it 10/20 years and they&#039;ll be able to make babies with no sperm and no egg.. just artificial replicas.<br /><br />Like it or not, technology is headed that way.<br /><br />If you went back to the 1700s with an Iphone, you&#039;d be executed for sorcery.<br /><br />So what are we to think of the progress made in the next 500 years? <br /><br />

				First off there will never be a day where a woman on this planet doesn&#039;t want the D as bad as you want her V. <br />Second of all if that day ever came Earth would be doomed because of all the pent up aggression men have due to testosterone. And the fact that almost every guy knows masturbation is only a temporary solution, since your basically settling for no sex.<br />Not a world I want to be in.

				Ok I put the answer in this way:<br />Actually supposing that a woman can&#039;t find a partner or he have reproductive problems, there are places where there are lot of human semen frozen so paying she can reproduce herself.<br />But (actually not in future) could men reproduce themself in lab or we are totally dependend from women?

				Well your kinda wrong there too. Gay men who want to have children often pay a surrogate to carry the baby using one of the males sperm. But to reiterate my earlier statement in a more educational matter. The human species has 46 chromosomes, which 23 you inherit from your mother (ie the egg) &amp; 23 from your father (ie the sperm). Now because each chromosome contains genomes ( which is the ingredients that make up a human, cat, etc..) and the genomes have a specific genetic sequence that can only be &quot;decrypted&quot; by that species; there is no way humans could be able asexually reproduce in any way. There are some species in the animal kingdom that can asexually reproduce. But as far as I know every mammal needs a male and female counterpart. I believe even if some artificial egg or seaman were to be created and used in reproduction, the product would be considered a chimera and not a human being anymore. &amp; that&#039;s if the construction of every chromosome was perfect. <br /><br />

				I dunno. With the Y chromosome getting smaller and smaller by generation, maybe the future might be in the hand of women. It`ll take million of years till the Y chromosome completely disappears, nothing we should be concerned about. I`m more interested in the human-animal embryos, so far the experiments are very controlled and due to laws and regulations the embryos are destroyed after they pass a certain cell count.
