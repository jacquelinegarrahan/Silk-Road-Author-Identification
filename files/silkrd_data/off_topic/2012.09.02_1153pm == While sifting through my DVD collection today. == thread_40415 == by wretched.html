				I stumbled upon an oldie but goodie, SLC PUNK. I wonder how many here have seen it. Anyway, I dosed on some shrooms an pushed play. I love that movie. I recommend it to anyone tripping. It always seems to do the same thing for me. Most times I get distracted while movies are on and I am tripping, but put SLC PUNK and I am riveted! So wretched&#039;s holiday weekend movie recommendation is SLC PUNK. It&#039;s funny, but that movie always brings tears to my eyes, sober or not!

				I watched SLC punk recently for the first time and enjoyed it.<br /><br />But why do so many of you people trip to movies? To each his own, but it.seems like.such a.waste of.a beautiful thing. <br /><br />Get your.asses outside!<br />

				I agree, i spend most of my time outside while tripping. <br /><br />I watched natural born killers while tripping and it send me down a bad road.&nbsp; I tried watching True Romance while tripping and it was the most complex thing I had ever seen, I had no idea what was going on.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a positive note, while on 2C-i, one of my friends put on Hard-Boiled and we turned off the subtitles.&nbsp; It was a laugh riot, we just had it on in the background, but we spent more time playing with, and analyzing the DVD case it came in....

				I don&#039;t always watch movies while I trip, but I do trip often enough that I sometimes end up watching movies while tripping. Today was the rare occasion where I found a movie that I hadn&#039;t seen in ages, so I decided to eat a bag of shrooms and watch it. But this is a holiday weekend, so maybe tomorrow I will trip outside while mowing the lawn or something like that. I don&#039;t know why so many people don&#039;t enjoy indoor activities like movies and video games while tripping. They can be just as fun as hiking, fishing, and boating. BTW, I do not suggest that anyone go scuba diving while tripping. snorkeling...maybe, but scuba is just too intense (some of you here read about my experience with that a few months ago)

				I like to mix it up a bit. I am a movie buff while sober anyway but cartoon movies are great while tripping like spy kids or the lorax. I watch a lot of those while my girl is here but then I find myself watching one while tripping in the am hours. Honestly I love a good tear jerker but not one after another I mean, I&#039;m not a chick so watching &quot;the other guys&quot; while tripping was very nice and funny
