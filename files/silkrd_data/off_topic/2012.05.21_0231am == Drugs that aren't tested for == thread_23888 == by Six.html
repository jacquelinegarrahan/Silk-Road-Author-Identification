				Hello everyone, I&#039;m new to SR. Long time lurker though I haven&#039;t made any purchases yet. I plan to this summer. I love the community here and there&#039;s nothing better than kicking back and reading some posts here, you guys are awesome.<br /><br />Anyways I don&#039;t want to say too much but I&#039;ll be going into the military soon and they&#039;re obviously going to test me before I go. I know about a few safe drugs already. I know acid isn&#039;t easily tested for, and I know shrooms are out of your system in no time, and I know DMT isn&#039;t tested for, but I was hoping someone here could give me a few other ideas, some fun RCs would be ideal. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />

				No they come out in your piss too mate. <br /><br />I&#039;m gunna be honest there is absolutely no point trying to find drugs that are going to beat tests because they are few-to-none. You want to work out how long things stay in your system so you can avoid them coming out in piss/blood/hair tests.

				It also depends on what kind of drug test your taking and if they are willing to spend extra money to go out of the normal 5 drugs that are tested for.&nbsp; Most psychedelic&#039;s wont show up in the average everyday drug test but you always to have to worry about the tester going out of their way and getting the premium test. <br /><br />Also if it&#039;s a piss test you can beat those pretty damn easy as most drugs leave your system in little as 3 days except weed which is a different story

				Don&#039;t they hair test you? Your hair basically contains your drug use history. I had a friend who went into the service, he had to answer questions related to drugs during a polygraph test, e.g., how many times have you used illegal drugs? which illegal drugs did you use? etc etc. They also said they would be hair testing him, he asked what they do if your body hair is shaven, and they replied, &quot;If your body hair and head are shaven, we WILL still find a hair.&quot;

It would be way too expensive to hair test every single person signing up for the military. Of course this is the US military I&#039;m talking about. Are you from somewhere else?<br />They did interview me, much like the polygraph test you&#039;re talking about. I denied ever using drugs though, because I know that despite what your recruiter tells you, your drug history does affect which job you&#039;re able to get.

				I think DMT gets metabolized so quickly that it wouldn&#039;t show up in any drug tests. And that&#039;s just regular DMT, not NN-DMT or anything an MAOI.

				Most tests don&#039;t test for psilocybin/DMT. Then again the more advanced ones do. And as for the other psychedelics, I&#039;ve got no idea. What I do know is that you can&#039;t bullshit a fucking test, do your research and make 100% sure before you take anything. You don&#039;t want to lose your job/go back inside because you felt like a hero.

				Yeah i have taken pee tests for probation and also mouth swabs and if they send to a lab than they test for almost anything.... Hallucinogens are hard to detect i believe and also there are things that do create false positives that arent drugs which sux...... I think it also weighs down to how much is in your system on a nanogram level
