				So I&#039;m hoping I can get a few scholars to give me some answers here.<br />My girlfriend was bulimic for over 2 years, and she has told me she stopped purging over 2 months ago. The first pysch we tried together was acid, 200ug each. I tripped my fucking balls off, had a great time, and saw her in a extremely beautiful new perspective.<br />She however, experienced a somewhat faint geometric pattern on the walls, skin, any surface, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Poof, it was over for her and nothing happened for the rest of the time while she sat with me. Within the next month I ordered some 2C-P, 2C-B, shroomies, 25c-nbome, and more acid. All together...we tripped about 5 times again. Every time she saw the same exact geometric pattern as the first time, and it lasted the same amount of time. I&#039;m 145lb, she about 125lb. We did not eat for hours for our trips, we dont know why its not working for her. Only thing I can think of is :<br />1) A damaged metabolism from years of binging and purging, <br />2) a high dxm tolerance that maybe crossed with the other drug tolerances (she tripped on 900-1100 mg&#039;s for months, around 15 times total)<br />3) A serotonin linked problem seeing as bulimia is linked to serotonin receptors and the drugs we used are classified as serotogenetic psychedelics (dxm is not serotonin linked)<br />Looking for answers and hopefully solutions to our psychedelic problems, thanks mates.

				I&#039;m the same weight as her, although I&#039;m likely much taller, and I too have also suffered from an eating disorder for a length of time yet I still manage to have an amazing time tripping on everything. If anything I&#039;d say I trip harder than most until my tolerance builds up so this makes me think it&#039;s unrelated to her disorder.&nbsp; :-\

				Im starting to think its more related to the DXM. I know DXM tolerance lasts for months, even a year or 2.<br />Ive read that DXM only has a cross tolerance between other dissociates like Ketamine, but I can think of no other explanation. They both effect the same 5-HT serotonin <br />I mean...do psychedelics just not work for some people? I don&#039;t see how that can be possible

				If something isn&#039;t working out right, then you don&#039;t know all the facts.<br /><br />However, my best guess is that she was a few months before you met her, or is now, taking some kind of SSRI antidepressants making the effects of the drugs completely useless.<br /><br />I took some SSRI anti depressants (MOST ANTIDEPRESSANTS INCLUDING SOME PAIN KILLERS) a few years ago, and still don&#039;t feel MDMA or 2C-B (or any psychedelics) anywhere near like I used to. I need to take 3 times the MDMA dose to feel the same as my partner.<br /><br />DONT TELL HER TO TAKE A 3 TIMES DOSE!!

				She was on Prozac months ago, but she says shes stopped taking it. I can&#039;t imagine its still in her system<br />I used Prozac years ago before taking psychedelics. They work fine for me, now

Prozac can permanently change your brain chemistry, it may be that she may never feel the ultimate ecstasy of psychedelics or MDMA like chemicals ever again.<br /><br />People need to be so so so so so so so so careful when taking anti-depressants.

				ok, so I think I know the problem now. She just informed me she takes her vitamins every day, one of them being Niacin. Could the Niacin be preventing the effects of psychedelics?<br />if so how long should she wait until the Niacin is out of her system to trip again

				I just heard today that niacin suppresses some drugs.<br />I didn&#039;t really research it though, so I wont say anything.
