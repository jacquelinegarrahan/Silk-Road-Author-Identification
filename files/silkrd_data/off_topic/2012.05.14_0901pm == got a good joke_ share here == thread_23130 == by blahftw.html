				Two guys were picked up by the cops for selling drugs and appeared in court before the judge. The judge said:<br /><br />You seem like nice young men, and I&#039;d like to give you a second chance rather than jail time. I want you to go out this weekend and try to show others the evils of drug use and persuade them to give up drugs forever. I&#039;ll see you back in court Monday.&quot;<br /><br />Monday, the two guys were in court, and the judge said to the first one:<br /><br />&quot;How did you do over the weekend?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, your honour, I persuaded 10 people to give up drugs forever.&quot;<br />&quot;10 people? That&#039;s wonderful. What did you tell them?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I used a diagram, your honour. I drew two circles like this: O o and told them this (the big circle) is your brain before drugs and this (small circle) is your brain after drugs.&quot;<br />&quot;That&#039;s admirable,&quot; said the judge. &quot;And you, how did you do?&quot; (to the 2nd guy)<br /><br />&quot;Well, your honour, I persuaded 50 people to give up drugs forever.&quot;<br />&quot;50 people! That&#039;s amazing! How did you manage to do that!&quot;<br />&quot;Well, I used the same two circles. I pointed to the small circle and told them, &#039;This is your asshole before prison....&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />YOU KNOW YOU&#039;RE A STONER WHEN..... (45 reasons)<br /><br />--Every story you tell begins with, &quot;We were really high and...&quot;<br />--You buy your Visine (eye-drops) at a wholesale club<br />--You&#039;re a Bob Marley fan and you don&#039;t even like reggae<br />- Mosquitoes get a buzz after attacking you.<br />--Someone asks you for a dime and you tell them you&#039;re out of herb<br />--The High Times centerfold turns you on<br />--Every vacation you wind up in Amsterdam or Jamaica<br />--Your friends call you Smokey<br />--Your parents call you Smokey<br />--Smoking resi on a daily basis is essential to keep your bowl from getting clogged<br />--Your cigarette gets way too heavy<br />--You think everyone is staring at you and there&#039;s nobody in the room<br />--All you want to do is drink &amp; smoke &amp; eat &amp; smoke &amp; chill &amp; smoke...<br />--Your room turns into your grow room<br />--The lab technician testing your urine sample gets high off the fumes<br />--Your best friend just happens to be your dealer<br />--You vote Harry Browne for president<br />--A friend without weed is a friend in need<br />--Your bumper sticker reads &quot;Honk for Hemp&quot;<br />--Someone finds a roach in your room, it&#039;s not a bad thing<br />--Your bong becomes an extension of your arm<br />--You went to a Hempfest<br />--You can&#039;t remember the Hempfest<br />--Your video collection consists of endless Cheech and Chong sequels<br />--Your too phoned to stone home<br />--Your creativity is only used when you have nothing to smoke out of<br />--You can ask for weed in other languages<br />--The mind is a terrible thing to waste, but you don&#039;t mind being wasted<br />--Sorting out life&#039;s problems, the answer is always roll, lick and smoke<br />--You want to have kids named Herb, Bud and MaryJane<br />--You were born caucasian but all your friends assume you&#039;re Chinese<br />--Your clothes are full of burnholes from dropped joints<br />--You learn about the KGB in history class and all you can think about are green sticky buds<br />--If an autobiography of your life was made into a movie, it would be called &quot;Waiting to Inhale&quot;<br />--You own too many pairs of Birkenstocks<br />--Breakfast consists of a spliff, some OJ, and a bowl packed with Fruity Pebbles<br />--You smoke your screens and save your roaches<br />--You clean out your car and smoke the shake you found on your car mats<br />--You forget your friends&#039; names<br />--You forget your own name<br />--Your motto in life is &quot;Why ask Why?

				It is in the interest of freedom to violently oppose those who seek to take it away. If people in the past would have united and stamped out fascism in the 30s, then we might have stopped the trouble afterwards, Im not prepared to make the same mistake of letting fascism operate freely on the streets in my town. We now know what it stands for, and we know what it can cause. <br /><br />Its not my problem most of society now chooses to ignore it and just watch the TV<br /><br />But hey Im old school, youll find other people with similar politics to mine who would never condone my actions.

				A guy joins the french foreign legion and is stationed in a fort in the middle of the desert. After 3 months of training he is feeling horny and stops by the commanding officers office and asks &quot;Where do the guys go for a good time?&quot; The CO stands up and points out the window at a camel in a pen.<br />He thanks the CO and thinks to him self &quot;I am not horny enough to fuck that camel!&quot;<br /><br />Another month goes by and he asks the Sargent &quot;Where do the guys go for a good time?&quot; The Sargent takes him around the corner and points to the camel. He pauses for a moment and then walks over to the camel, drops his pants and starts fucking the camel.<br /><br /><br />The Sargent walks over and says &quot;Son, most of the men get on the camel and it takes them to the brothel two miles down the road&quot;
