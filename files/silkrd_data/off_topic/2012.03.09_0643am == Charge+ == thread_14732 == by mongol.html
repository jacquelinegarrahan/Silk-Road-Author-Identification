				Hi, everyone ))<br /><br />A couple years ago I bought some powder from an online UK store, it was called Charge+. It was quite nice, and it didn&#039;t have any comedown (although I threw up in the end). Did 0.5g in one evening.<br /><br />Does anyone know if the stuff they&#039;re selling now is the same as it was 2-3 years ago?

				no probably not, chances are it was some sort of cathinone based RC back then so it will have changed as pretty much all the cathinones were made illegal, at a guess as it made you puke im willing to guess it was methylone or butylone in there as they tended to make me puke whereas 4-mmc didnt even at high doses. chances are these days itll be based on MPA or 6-APB but there is no way to know for sure unless you happen to have the aid of a lab.<br /><br />in any event you should always avoid stuff sold like that as youre seeing the problem right now, you dont know what you took, never buy anything like that unless they tell you what the chemicals are in it
