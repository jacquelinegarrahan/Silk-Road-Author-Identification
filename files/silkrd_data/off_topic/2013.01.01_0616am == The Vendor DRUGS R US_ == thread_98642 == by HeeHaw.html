				PM ME IF YOU CAN HELP ME FIND THIS VENDORS FORUM THREAD PLEASE! +1 to those who do<br /><br />Happy fucking New years to all you silk roaders! You are my brothers and sisters and friends and country men. Yes even if your in a different country because I am not bound by one country. I am of this Earth and I know no strangers but I do know some criminals. <br /><br />Ok guys the matter at hand. A few weeks back during when SR had it&#039;s frustrating down time, when there were some samples being offered thru the forums I got in on a sample of MDPV from a vendor named DRUGS R US. According to my messages he PM&#039;d me telling me he had sent it a month agao and it finally showed up today. Hell I had forgot all about it.<br /><br />At first I thought it may have been some DMT from another vendor but it wasn&#039;t. So I began to think really hard and I remembered I was suppose to get some MDPV from somebody so I went to the categories and clicked on stimulants. I searched thru it until I found MDPV then I clicked on that category. <br /><br />Drugs r us was the first result to come up and it said where he shipped from so I thought that may be it so I clicked on his name and then I clicked on send message and there it was the evidence from a month ago where we had talked about it so I was glad I found the right vendor and figured out what this was before I snorted some DMT or something else.&nbsp; I looked it up on erowid and it looked just like the stuff I had so I took the plunge and snorted between 5 and 10 mg. <br /><br />Now I can mark it off my list of drugs tried. This stuff sure does give you lots of energy for a long time from just a lil bit. This is one I would want to be careful on. It&#039;s got great euphoria and energy for the first 2 hours but then after that it started to get a lil jittery and the urge to re dose is at hand after a couple or three hours. The drain from it is not to bad. The focus and awareness it gives you is crazy. I guess I have re dosed twice now in about an 8 hour stretch. I had to work till 00:25 dammit right into New Years but I was wired the whole time. I red somewhere where this stuff is like Ritalin and I&#039;d have to agree though it&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve done Ritalin.<br /><br />It&#039;s very strong tho. Mine is a tan color and they say that&#039;s the best MDPV is when it&#039;s the tan variation. I can see where some folks may use this stuff to cut their other stems such as coke, mephedrone, crystal meth, and others as well. It really has not got much taste to it and not much texture either. It is a powder and any chunks that may fall out of the bag are just easily crushed into powder as it is powder really no chunks or rockiness or hard pieces at all. <br /><br />I shared it with some others and they are all flying with speed and energy and focus.<br /><br />Anyway you can tell I am wired because of all this rambling on. I don&#039;t usually do this much talking at once but this stuff has me wanting to talk. Thanks guys for any help finding this vendors thread. I have PM&#039;d him on the road but he hasn&#039;t answered it in 9 hours now
