				Ok, yeah I know this can be easily purchased from a lot of places, but what I&#039;m wondering is... what is the most pure, most potent product version of it that anyone knows of?&nbsp; I see a lot of advertisements about 10x, 20x, 120x and in the form of extracts, dry leaf, etc etc.&nbsp; all seems like marketing and doesn&#039;t really tell me what will be the strongest.&nbsp; Any herbal experts out there have some insight?&nbsp; and, where do you recommend purchasing?

				It is all marketting, unless you buy from a reputable vendor.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken kratom for 3-4 years, it&#039;s AWESOME for work (euphoria makes me not hate my life/work so much, energy makes me work harder).&nbsp; Don&#039;t expect anything powerful or extreme, it&#039;s not, but it&#039;s still a damned good (CHEAP) mild opiate substitute<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried this leaf and that leaf, extract blah.&nbsp; Firstly the extract are a complete waste of money unless you are rich (and foolish).&nbsp; Secondly there is no real way for you to tell that it&#039;s &#039;bali&#039; or whatever because the leaf is ground up (even if you asked for it not to be powdered it is still ground up).<br /><br />I get mine at what I consider to be a very reasonable price of $250/kg ($7/ounce), if they charge you much more, you are dealing with a vendor that ... you shouldn&#039;t deal with :D<br /><br />You don&#039;t need to make tea, i wasted time doing that.&nbsp; What I do is buy some 000 capsules (e-bay), grind up a handful of kratom when i&#039;m ready to pill em up.&nbsp; Grind in coffee grinder until ... ultra fine, fill capsule, take an allen key and jam the kratom powder as much into the pill as you can, close it up. <br /><br />Takes 5 and i&#039;m buzzin.&nbsp; I&#039;ve learned with kratom, for me at least, that the potency of effects plateua&#039;s at a certain point and that taking more is futile, wasteful, and if you take too much will give you a headache.<br /><br />It may sound like a lot of work but that&#039;s just cuz I spelled it out for you :D, I can typically make about 50 capsules in one episode of family guy on my computer :D.&nbsp; Added bonus that this makes kratom portable, u can take it with u anywhere (like say the in-laws).<br /><br />1kg pilled up lasts me for ... hell of a long time (excluding those that I sell to friends).<br /><br />Honestly, if you are serious about getting decent kratom at reasonable cost you should buy at least 1/2kg -&gt; 1kg at a time.&nbsp; I say this because it&#039;s a simple way of weeding out the vendor&#039;s that are just trying to leech mad profit from the unfortunate black market kratom ignorance :(.&nbsp; They will outright refuse to serve you, or just ignore your e-mail&#039;s.&nbsp; I wish I could tell you my source but he doesn&#039;t list it in his inventory anymore and will only sell it to clients who had past kratom purchases from him :(<br /><br />Also the best vendors are the small vendors, aka not iamshaman (their leaf is ok, but just that).&nbsp; Typically they will do special services for you, such as mixing all of their kratom &#039;strains&#039; into one wonder kilogram mix.&nbsp; Can&#039;t say this is better then that when they&#039;re all in there :)<br /><br />Just, please, don&#039;t buy extract&#039;s ... don&#039;t support that corrupt marketing branch of kratom (you&#039;ll run out of the extract before I can say the word extract ... and get no more higher).<br /><br />O, and if you are buying in bulk, ask for crushed leaf (not powdered), and store it in your fridge.&nbsp; Grind it up into a powder only as you need to make the pills, i&#039;ve noticed that powdered kratom degrades (loses it&#039;s potency) faster then crushed leaf.<br /><br />KRATOM POWER !

				Thanks for the insight.&nbsp; You were actually more helpful than most of what I found on other random forums.&nbsp; I decided to just buy some and give it a try and go from there.&nbsp; I went with &quot;Premium Thai&quot; powder capsules from areanaeg.com.&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp; 1 ounce was $17.99 but not sure how much is in each capsule.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know if they&#039;re 00 or 000.<br /><br />I tried taking 4 just to get an idea and it sucks, feel no effect whatsoever.&nbsp; Is the powder just as potent as buying crushed leaves and grinding and packing them?&nbsp; Ya sure it doesn&#039;t matter if I buy thai, bali, indo, etc?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again.&nbsp; your price per kg is pretty nice.&nbsp; Could you perhaps check with your supplier and see if he/she would consider another customer?&nbsp; PM me.

FRESH ON THE TREE), if it&#039;s crushed you can find pieces of leaves with veins intact.<br /><br />My vendor told me that a lot of vendors actually weigh down the product with powdered kratom stem (which has no 7-HO-Mytrigynine in it, the alkaloid that gets you high) and even SAND !&nbsp; I did not believe this non-sense, so he actually sent me a package of ground of stem powder, which indeed did not do shit.&nbsp; He told me if I wanted it, he&#039;d give me all his stem powder/fragments he had for free if I covered shipping lol.&nbsp; He also sent me samples of his extracts, which were all garbage (I could get high ... once) and I trust and have trusted him with good Kratom for 3-4 years now and trust his extracts were good.<br /><br />During those day&#039;s of research I also came to learn that the ENTIRE KRATOM MARKET comes from ONLY THREE SOURCES (perhap&#039;s more now).&nbsp; Once it&#039;s been moved down 2-3 tiers of distribution, your premium thai may now be bali, vice versa... if that&#039;s what the distributor want&#039;s to call it (I don&#039;t know what today&#039;s popular strain is, but Bali was the &#039;premium&#039; the few years ago when I was researching Kratom).<br /><br />If you want to fall into the Kraom brand naming/what&#039;s better argument go right ahead, but i&#039;m pretty sure I just made my view on it pretty clear haha.<br /><br />The site you linked doesn&#039;t load, so I can&#039;t say anything to their wares (but you said it did fuck all to you so i&#039;m gonna go with shit company), but try not to buy pre-pilled, they are marked up quite significantly.&nbsp; The &#039;standard&#039; pill i&#039;ve seen from such online herbal vendors are size 1, which that table in the e-bay link says holds up to 350mg per pill.&nbsp; There&#039;s 28 grams an ounce, so unless you got at least (28g)/(0.35g/pill) = 80 pills for $17.99 then you got taken.<br /><br />My vendor got out of the kratom business a long time ago, he only sells to me because we live in the same country (i&#039;m Canadian, not American), and I was a regular 1kg buyer from him for 2 years before he got out, so he just does it to me as a favour.<br /><br />I can&#039;t attest to the service or quality of any easy to find (google) wholesale kratom suppliers so the only thing I can suggest to you is to start reading deeper into the Kratom forums around, and you will eventually find a wholesale vendor.&nbsp; It&#039;s just like here I guess, trust earns you the right to special sites/connections.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; I can estimate the amount of kratom me and my friends need to get high from that e-bay chart, so it might help you.&nbsp; Most of the time I don&#039;t pack them down with an allen key so they&#039;re &#039;typical&#039;, which is 960mg ... or about a gram.&nbsp; We take 5pills (and i&#039;ve always taken 5, with no sign of tolerance, but I also do not use them more then once a week, twice some weeks maybe), so 5grams.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;d say break some of those pills open you have and measure out 5g and give that a go (parachute it i guess, or just eat it, it doesn&#039;t taste bad and people are pussies lol).&nbsp; Anything less will give me maybe a MILD MILD buzz (and only cuz i&#039;m very familiar with the effects/feelings kratom induces), anything over 8g will give you a bad headache.&nbsp; Anything between the amount that gets you high and gives you a headache won&#039;t make any difference, taking more kratom won&#039;t get you more high, you can only get so high on kratom ... and it&#039;s NOT a strong opioid effect like people who buy it for the first time think it will be.&nbsp; It&#039;s in many way&#039;s better actually (i&#039;m sure all the opiate junkies will flame me, but you can go back to IVing oxycodone and leave me alone ;) ).<br />Good luck.
