				The dude wrestled crocodiles on a daily basis, and managed to work with reptiles for&nbsp; his entire life without getting bitten by anything venomous.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Now I think about it, he&#039;s like Australia&#039;s answer to Chuck Norris.<br /><br />This same man was killed by a fish. <br /><br />And I speak only on behalf of only myself here, I&#039;m sure other Irwin fans think differently. And I&#039;m not even Australian.<br /><br />

				As an australian I&#039;m not offended by being called a steve irwin, that dude travelled the world, had a fuck ton of money, had a smart, hot mrs and like Brit said above he fucking wrestled crocs.<br /><br />As for never being bitten, he got bitten all the time... anti-venine on hand at all times! <br />STILL, that dude was one of the TOUGHEST CUNTS to walk the earth, and some people are never fair game for bad jokes!<br /><br />Think harder, I would have REALLY taken offence if you said we all look like Paul Hogan or Rolf Harris!!!<br /><br /><br />Oh, hope your Cyber date went well Perky!!!

				i liked him and dont think cred was lost for that sting ray killing him...he wrestled croc and jump roped with lethal snakes. <br /><br />and my cyber date went ok, we kissed at the end of it, mr. jimpooley<br /><br />its fucked up how south park made fun of the death when im a huge fan of both...(but its not the first time my favorite show on cable has offended me)<br /><br />im going to google the story now actually, we need to make a irwin group with steve irwin buddy icons

				Not a bindi fan, but kids love steve! Don&#039;t mean to be a wowser about it either, I&#039;m a BIG fan of BAD humour, but like I said, some dudes just don&#039;t touch...<br /><br />So, who&#039;s got a michael jackson joke?
