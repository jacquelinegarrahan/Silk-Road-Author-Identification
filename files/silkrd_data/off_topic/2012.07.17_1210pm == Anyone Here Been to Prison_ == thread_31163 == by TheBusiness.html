				I have done a little bit of time inside.<br /><br />Visiting!<br /><br />UK jails are not so bad. My buddy got into a Cat C prison as he was done for fraud.<br /><br />Worse thing about UK prisons is the younger lads, many fucked up by circumstances more than drugs. Coke does not help you work out anger issues.<br /><br />There is some bullying, not as bad as USA jails. For instance the fear of getting one up the ass is a myth. It happened way back I guess but most gay men in a prison full of men, some who aint been laid for a decade, its all consensual.<br /><br />Main thing for younger men who do time is NEVER take any favors inside. If you use drugs use jail to take a break especially if you use H or crack. <br /><br />Don&#039;t show weakness. There are cases of younger prisoners forcing some to get stuff inside.&nbsp; Even people&#039;s mothers have smuggled as if their son is targeted it is bad. Easy answer though, report bullying, but NEVER name the prisoner. If you can handle yourself then take care all the same, thankfully it is rare for ordinary prisoners to be hurt. If bullied badly smash your cell up. Repeat if needs be. Write also, create a stir, the prions do take bullying seriously but obviously you cannot cry to the guv and name names. <br /><br />Main thing is to take no shit but in an amicable manner.<br /><br />Keep away from drugs - many prisons have gangs and individuals who can target families of prisoners outside. If you don&#039;t do drugs you won&#039;t be seen as an easy mark. H costs a lot inside, you might think a 100mg bag of H is nothing but inside that shit has to go a long long way.

My buddy got into a Cat C prison as he was done for fraud.<br /><br />Worse thing about UK prisons is the younger lads, many fucked up by circumstances more than drugs. Coke does not help you work out anger issues.<br /><br />There is some bullying, not as bad as USA jails. For instance the fear of getting one up the ass is a myth. It happened way back I guess but most gay men in a prison full of men, some who aint been laid for a decade, its all consensual.<br /><br />Main thing for younger men who do time is NEVER take any favors inside. If you use drugs use jail to take a break especially if you use H or crack. <br /><br />Don&#039;t show weakness. There are cases of younger prisoners forcing some to get stuff inside.&nbsp; Even people&#039;s mothers have smuggled as if their son is targeted it is bad. Easy answer though, report bullying, but NEVER name the prisoner. If you can handle yourself then take care all the same, thankfully it is rare for ordinary prisoners to be hurt. If bullied badly smash your cell up. Repeat if needs be. Write also, create a stir, the prions do take bullying seriously but obviously you cannot cry to the guv and name names. <br /><br />Main thing is to take no shit but in an amicable manner.<br /><br />Keep away from drugs - many prisons have gangs and individuals who can target families of prisoners outside. If you don&#039;t do drugs you won&#039;t be seen as an easy mark. H costs a lot inside, you might think a 100mg bag of H is nothing but inside that shit has to go a long long way.

				Hey&nbsp; :P<br /><br />My advice.. We´ll don&#039;t go... would be my best advice, which means have your head screwed on in the street. Buy safe, don&#039;t fight people, be polite don&#039;t drive whilst fucked out of your mind on drugs etc..<br /><br />Then if you do get caught simples: <br /><br />Do not open your mouth until you have spoken to your brief and can judge that hes at least someway competent, if hes an appointed brief and hes looking at his watch a lot, or hurrying you along, tell him to fuck himself as he thinks your freedom is worth less than his wife´s pot roast.. <br /><br />It´s no comment to everything, in a polite manner, don´t nod, shake your head or point. <br /><br />Remember no matter how nice the piggy seems to be, as soon as hes out of the room hes telling his co piggy´s what a tosser you are and how he´d love to see you raped by 20 well hung sea lions... or words to that effect. <br /><br />A no comment is NOT an indication of guilt. Always remember this...<br /><br />@ Court:<br /><br />If your this worried then you are most likely going to crown court, so If you have the privilege of getting bailed from the station, get your affairs in order pronto, before you´re committal hearing. That means sending money to friends so they can send you in postal orders, getting a bag of clothes ready. Remember if you go to prison before you are sentenced, i-e your´re not granted bail from court or from the station you can bring your own clothes with you, also sealed tobacco and money to be added to your canteen account. Make sure your friends / family have money for you that they can send in over time to get you on your feet until you get a prison job. give passwords to your facebook etc to a trusted friend so they can update the rest of your friends on how you are / create a group etc.. If it looks like your going away for a while you might want to think of selling some of your things etc.. the world changes a lot in a few years, whilst you just stay still, friends, girlfriends etc.. they mostly all move on. You think you have many friends in this world whilst your out and about, but as soon as people don&#039;t see you every day, every week, every month they start to forget, and soon you´ll be but a distant memory. Prepare yourself for this. If you´re committal is a while away, get healthy, detox, wean you´re way of drugs or your likely to be given an inadequate detox course inside that pretty much leaves you cold turkey.. And why not, go to the gym, bulk up a little, you want to be walking into prison with your head up, looking people in the eye, you need self esteem. Not looking like a mouse that just got savaged by a ferret, you want people to understand that if they touch you or your things there will be trouble, and you want to express this without fighting..<br /><br />Soo youré in the court cells, unusually optimistic. Your times up, you´ve been riding in a sweat box all day and you just want it done with, you go up to court and everythings a blur, you´re asked questions if you went not guilty, and your just spoken at if you went guilty.. you think you just heard someone say 3 years.. that can´t be right can it.. You´re led away to the cells and you have to ask the court jailer what the fuck just happened, she explains it and your fate is sealed..<br /><br />Finally you arrive in prison, your searched, given your number, prison greys and led to the induction wing.. Now i wont bore you with details.. but here are the do´s and dont´s<br /><br />DO. <br />Speak to people assertively<br />Look people in the eye<br />Hold your Ground<br />Be polite<br />Make acquaintances<br />Keep regular contact with the outside world<br />Get a job<br />go to the gym<br />Read<br />Write<br />Better yourself<br /><br />DONT<br />be a pussy, its really not a fun place for someone with no cojones, if you cant help it, use your whit and charisma to find friends pronto.<br />watch TV all day<br />take the piss out of prison staff<br />give up on life<br />take drugs inside.. actually I´ll rephrase, dont be indebted to anyone<br />confuse your acquaintances with friends<br />self harm<br />think its all over, even a 10 year stretch isn´t 10 years, you´ve still got a long and happy life after.. <br /><br /><br />MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! <br /><br />Send me all of your drugs before you go in.&nbsp; ::) no, seriously<br />&amp;<br />GO NOT GUILTY, unless they found you naked and writhing in a vat full of LSD with the words this is my LSD tattoed on your chest and a list of all of your customers scrawled over your body in marker pen.. and even in that case I would still try not guilty by reason of..&nbsp; &nbsp;Make the fuckers work to put you away dont give it to them.. <br /><br />Also have a hunt round to see if any friends of friends are inside.. its good to know people..<br /><br /><br /><br />CIAO beautiful people :D<br /><br />ACE<br />

				Ive been to the state juvenile prison...A couple times lol the first time was a year and a half! The advice for if you get busted would be<br />1.Deny EVERYTHING.Even if they search you and find 2 ounces don&#039;t say ANYTHING and NEVER ever ever admit to anything.<br />2.Don&#039;t say ANYTHING unless its can I get a lawyer.<br />3.Set up a code word with a family member or trusted friend and ask for a call then use this code word so he knows to get to your house and clean it out ASAP.<br />4.Always remember that pigs are the scum of the earth and that they will lie and try act like your friend they will do anything they have to do to get you in prison.Literally police want only one thing and that one thing is to put your ass away as long as possible.<br />5.Don&#039;t be disorderly because they&#039;ll get you on that but definitely do talk shit to them.Just be an asshole.If you know you&#039;re in trouble anyway just call them out on everything they say.Just tell them to fuck off.Because police officers are power hungry control freaks and they HATE when people challenge their authority.You have a freedom of speech so always run your mouth.Because it will piss them off and they wont think straight when they&#039;re pissed.Ive actually got caught with like a little under an oz in my house but they searched it illegally because I was talking shit to them on the porch.Needless to say they broke into my house (without a warrant) and all charges had to be dropped.Maybe you&#039;ll get lucky and they&#039;ll hit you and then you can have a free pass on anything (or you could sue them)<br />6.Don&#039;t trust anyone that you wouldn&#039;t trust with your life....even then be very careful!<br />7.Don&#039;t even talk to pigs.They don&#039;t want to help they want to send you to the pen.If they try to question you and they aren&#039;t charging you with anything just walk away/leave.<br />8.And remember if its under a year its no big thing its not as bad as people say its just REALLY boring.And you always got to worry about getting fucked up (not fucked) I don&#039;t actually know anyone that&#039;s been raped in prison (with the exceptions of child molesters hahaha everyone rapes them! but they don&#039;t count as people anyway) <br />Pretty much number 1 rule for me is don&#039;t drive while high,if you&#039;re going out after smoking weed then change clothes and put on cologne.Thats how you don&#039;t get busted :)<br />That,and only deal with like 2-3 people 1 if possible.Remember don&#039;t mix business (buying drugs) with pleasure (hanging out with drug dealers) that always ends bad...and hmmm thats all I can think of really.

				Been there done that. 1 year on a 3-5.<br /><br />IF you can&#039;t avoid it, meet it head on. Prison is no place for pussies. If you ARE ONE you become one...fast. Expect friends and family to abandon you. Think about it. Is prison a place you would voluntarily visit? <br /><br />Make acquaintances inside. Don&#039;t let yourself become a mark. Stand up for yourself and fight back if necessary. Get a job(kitchen, work crew, etc) or take any classes available. Remember that any debt you incur can be recalled in any denomination the lender desires. Stay as debt free as you can. Work out. Keep your mind off of &#039;what if&#039; and &#039;when I&#039;. Try to stay out of other people&#039;s drama. Do YOUR time.
