				Dear Sr community, as most you you know the Black market reloaded ( http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/ ) is down. My question to you is : Do you think they will be back online ? And if so how much time do you think it I&#039;ll take for the website to work again. ? <br /><br />I have 8.9 bitcoins in my BMR balance, is it fair to kiss those bit coins goodbye ? <br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to receiving your comments and thought on this subject <br /><br />Thank you

				It load fine for me. Calm down. Sites go offline for a variety of reasons, from hardware failures, human error, hackers or DDoS attacks, or yes- in this case, seizure or some sort of intervention or shutdown. Just because you can&#039;t access the site for a little while doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that the latter happened. Either do some research and see if there is something to corroborate your fears or maybe keep a benzo stash around for this purpose cause you seem ready to hit the panic button pretty darn quick. <br /><br />It&#039;s all good :)

				Gotta agree with SSBD. Your first post in the big boy forum should not be asking the SR community about BMR&#039;s connectivity. <br />Sorry about your 8.9 bitcoins.. but nobody really cares about that site to begin with. If it&#039;s down *yawn, if it&#039;s up *yawn*.<br /><br />

				The traffic on BMR is tiny compared to SR.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know from experience, but I would think Atlantis is similar.&nbsp; IMHO, no need to bother with the small markets unless there is something there that you can not buy on SR.&nbsp; For example, maybe you are a piece of shit who steals credit card info or deals in such data.&nbsp; BMR is perfect for you!<br /><br />
