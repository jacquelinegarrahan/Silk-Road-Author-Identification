				Hey all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading the forums a lot and I&#039;ve noticed that many people write about their wives doing the drugs with them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me, but around here it&#039;s unheard of for a girl to go any further than weed. Let alone LSD or other psychedelics.<br /><br />Where do you meet them? Beatle fan gatherings? Random clubs? The internets?<br /><br /><br />I really want somebody to love, somebody who would venture to the edge of the world with me.

				Gotta be careful about that sort of thing, you ever end up having a frog soup dilemma? Where you are with a perfectly nice girl but then slowly you start to realize she&#039;s out of her goddamn mind? That happened to me, and the bitch called my parents and told them about my drug use to spite me. She even had the goddamn nerve to act like she did it to help me, because she &quot;still cares&quot;. She&#039;s the one who got me doing drugs in the first place! <br /><br />Fucking females..

				Craigslist.<br />E-Harmony FREE Weekends. Make sure to list all your favorite drugs in your likes.<br />Ukraine.<br />Waiting outside Planned Parenthood clinic, just be sure to hit on the ones coming out, not going in.<br />McDonalds. Recently read a story about 2 women prostituting themselves out for shit on the value menu and Big Macs are now 2 for $5, you do the math.

				i think my girlfriend doesn&#039;t mind me using &#039;hard drugs&#039; like mdma, coke or mephedrone because i don&#039;t use them that often. although she doesn&#039;t use them herself, we have the occasional spliff together. which is pretty allllrrright i guessss.&nbsp;

				haha, you sound young.&nbsp; stop looking for a wife who does drugs and get out there and fuck some ho&#039;s.&nbsp; this is advice from a happily married man, btw.<br /><br />if you do drugs and the all the girls in your circles of friends don&#039;t, then you&#039;ve already got a leg up to fuck some sluts because you&#039;re the &quot;bad boy.&quot;&nbsp; be confident and subtly act like they&#039;re juvenile for having the establishments views on drugs.&nbsp; you&#039;ll be able to sniff out the chicks that are horny and bored with their gray boring lives.&nbsp; At the very least, you&#039;ll find one who thinks she can change you to be the clean cut square she thinks she wants.&nbsp; talk her into swallowing some proper molly and she&#039;ll do whatever drug you want her to afterwards.&nbsp; oh, and when you&#039;re all hopped up on drugs, fucking her from behind, at least once you gotta make her call you &quot;spacewasp&quot;<br /><br />as for the wife part, all i can say is: do with your life whatever the fuck YOU want to do, strive to be a decent person and not a prick, and at some point the universe will set you up with your match.&nbsp; then you realize your stuck with her.&nbsp; then you go on the internet and tell young dudes to bang as many chicks as they can.

				I met mine almost 20 years ago- she came over to my house with a mutual friend, and we did...&nbsp; Drugs, of all things.&nbsp; She&#039;s just a cool chick who likes to catch a buzz, any kind of buzz, like me.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t imagine dating, or especially marrying,&nbsp; a woman who didn&#039;t share that interest.&nbsp; Having to hide shit from my wife?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; She&#039;s my partner in crime 100%.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t have it any other way.&nbsp; I know a lot of people who hide their drug use from their wives/significant others, and wonder how the hell they ever got together in the first place.

				DO NOT get a wife who loves drugs!!!<br /><br />Mine does only one - but that is enough for me to do a variety of drugs when I choose to do them!<br /><br />Guys who get the wife who does all the drugs they do might have to pay for those drugs if she does not work!<br /><br />My wife does coke, but very seldom, if she it once a month it would be a lot for her! She enjoys that a few times a year, she works, she pays for it, I am left to smoke each day and if I want to do some E or maybe eat some hash or a dab of valium or maybe a little pahrmacutrical gear she does not mind.<br /><br />guys who married the women who does every drug might end up with a wife who has a gram of coke a day habit combined with downers, uppers, this that and the other.<br /><br />Imagine the horror of getting home after a week away to see your stash of weed gone!<br /><br />I know guys this happened to.<br /><br />So get yourself a one drug women who does that drug weekends only at most.<br /><br />If she can pay for it even better. Easy to get hooked on a women and gift her half an 8 ball every Saturday night! Costly also. <br /><br />I&#039;m not being mean. I&#039;d buy Mrs Red anything, but she knows I do not earn a great deal so buys her own coke. Also I usually get stung on coke IRL and stopped buying years ago. Mrs Red can score if needs be but SR coke has been better than UK sourced coke for her. On a par with the coke she has been using in the USA for a long lomg time when she visits! We never took any back. But posting?&nbsp; ;D

				find someone you love, and if they are uneducated on drugs, give her a proper education<br />just like anything drugs are dangerous if misused. so is the sun, cars, vitamins, antibiotics, advil, tylenol, knowledge<br /><br />if she isn&#039;t able to listen to a well thought out rational argument then you have an issue, if she understands but is unwilling she should not judge you as long as you are not causing yourself harm. but maybe someday she will turn around and be interested to share the experience with you<br /><br />don&#039;t know if you want want to be with anyone who &quot;Loves&quot; drugs, rather someone who &quot;Loves&quot; you

				I was sort of known for doing drugs (and introducing people to drugs) in High School, and I offered a girl I had gone out with before that to have a trip with me. We ended up having a great time and so we started going out again and still are. We do less drugs now, but we have more fun when we do.

				I&#039;m on the fence on the whole subject. On one hand I love my girlfriend doesn&#039;t smoke weed or do other drugs, so my stash is my stash. Last girlfriend used my stash as a grab bag to smoke and snort up my shit while on top of making me listen to her horrible day, every day.<br /><br />On the flip side, I wish my girlfriend would trip with me, that&#039;s really the only drug that when I take alone I wish I could share it with someone. I have a druggy booty call for mdma/xtc, but she isn&#039;t into psychs either.

				Last girl I dated would only do weed, every other drug was &quot;GROSS&quot; to her.&nbsp; So I ended up NEVER telling her I did the other drugs, and guess what?&nbsp; She never found out, I just kept it between me and my close friends.&nbsp; I once grew 34 plants of weed in my attic, I never told her about it.&nbsp; Girls are crazy, I figured hey one day if I break up with this bitch, what doesn&#039;t stop her from calling cops saying hey my ex bf has 34 plants in his attic?&nbsp; Fuck that, you can&#039;t trust women, they are bottle rockets, just set one off they are revenge whores.&nbsp; <br /><br />On another note, it would be cool to find a girl who was cool with rolling MDMA, tripping with etc, but to me I don&#039;t need that in a relationship, that&#039;s why I have my homeys!&nbsp; Some things are better left for you and your friends, not the ones you sleep with.&nbsp;
