				Sometimes when I&#039;m bored I google news search silk road. There is almost always a new article about it and they always have hilarious information. For example the huffington post just had a pretty good article. It said, in order to log in you need a, username, password, and pin. Well as we know that would be a phishing site scam. The report was done on a scam site. On the negetive side there are articles popping up every few days bringing more and more attention on us. &nbsp;<br />What does everyone think?<br /><br />As a side note anyone in USA order from Tyl3r Durden? How fast was shipping?

				Lol that is pretty funny that they were on a phishing site&nbsp; &nbsp;:P I sometimes do the same thing and see what I come across.<br /><br />This site just keeps getting bigger and bigger, which is not necessarily a good thing because it&#039;s starting to bring a lot of unwanted attention.

I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Sometimes I just like to point it out again to be sure it doesn&#039;t get lost if somebody writes a story after reading this thread or something, ya know.

Not to get political, just saying that it has an agenda just like every corporate enterprise. It is not and never has been an independent investigative entity there for the sheer purpose of doing good journalism.
