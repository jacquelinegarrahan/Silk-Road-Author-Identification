				Hey Guys, <br /><br />&nbsp;My name is ACE and as some of you already know we are moving away from street selling and into SR territory! Oooo.. Our plan was to be set up by the 3rd. We have everything sorted, product and lots of it,&nbsp; business envelopes and parcels, couriers ready to work, vac packers, business stamps, new location and transport. However we still need to get the seller account sorted. <br /><br />To start will be offering LSD edibles (MMmnnn) acid tabs printed especially for us (more on the designs and strength in the product offers forum on the 3rd) and opium, but not just any opium! Persian cooked opium and Spanish fresh opium. As we phase out or street selling op in the UK we will throw more money into getting some new products for you guys to try! Rhino K, 5-meo-DMT, 2cb pressed pills (pressed by us), liquid LSD and pre-ban Mcat are all things we currently sell in the UK at very cheap prices that we want to offer on SR. <br /><br />Right, to the loan thing. The way our operation works at the mo is that we transfer funds from a UK account to our offshore account in europe, that account is linked to MTGOX. So we transfer to europe, into MTGOX, wallet, bitcloud, wallet and SR! This process takes about 7 working days, 4 days for the transfer to Spain, 2 days from that account to MTGOX and then into SR. We ordered the transfer today, so we should have BTC by the 6th or the 7th. We ideally wanted to have our product testers on our seller account and forum page by the 3rd in order not to waste another week, because we are literally ready to go! We have invested over 7K in this dream so far and a lot of effort and stress to get the best product out there. So you can understand why we are eager to get started! <br /><br />Why didn´t you have the money available already? Well that&#039;s my fault. What with all the rushing around setting up the new premises and organizing drop routes, logistics and security I overlooked the balance of the Spanish account. It´s easy to forget the simple things when you are concentrating so hard on the complicated things. <br /><br />So in short we need 12BTC to put towards the seller account and in return we offer:<br />17BTC on or before the 7th<br />orrrr<br />15BTC and 4 acid tabs and 2g opium sent out on the 7th with the BTC<br />orrrr<br />12BTC and $80 worth of product at cost price, that is what we would get for $80 buying bulk, that&#039;s our special price with our suppliers when we order over 10 sheets of acid and 500g opium... at the price we get 80$ goes a looong way. <br /><br />If no one can lend its no problem we will wait another week :D We are just keen to get our goodies out to you as fast as possible! <br /><br /><br />Also I wanted to hide this in here to see if they spot it :P the following forum and IRC members will get the following:<br /><br />shitwassocash - 3 Acid tabs because its time you drank the god juice! Vac Packed so just bung in the freezer and they will keep for ages. <br />The crazy couple moonflower(bear) and flesh eating bacteria . - 4 tabs or 1,5g opium cause you guys rock and Botulism is always helping people with her IRC thread<br />Lim&nbsp; - 2 tabs or 1g cooked opoum, lol cause I owe you a pint dude<br />nomad bloodbath - 5 tabs or 2g opium cause you put so much of you into here, your time, your effort, all unpaid to ensure we continue being able to do what we do.. <br />Cazz - 2 tab acid or 1 tab opium - cause you rock and always make me giggle in IRC<br />Pakak1 . for standing up for what you believe in dude. (and to test stealth ship to your homeland)<br /><br />This is in addition to the samples to the LSDavengers for testing and the people that have already contacted me for the LSD edible samples again for feedback and testing<br /><br />If you don&#039;t want it you can nominate any other forum member to take your place! The only condition is that you leave feedback on our seller thread when we put it up. <br /><br />The samples are cause I love you guys, but also to test our stealth ship, we have different methods for different countries depending on what the most common parcel/letter is to that country.<br /><br />LOVE! ACE<br /><br />

Lemme know how you want the sample shipped or if you wanna freebee it to someone, it would help however if it were someone in Israel as we are working hard to perfect a stealth ship for that region.

				I&#039;m here for a reference.<br />ACE is a honest guy and he is not going to take your money and hide trust me!<br />I wish I had enough BTC, I would have done it but it looks that my habits are stronger than my good heart. <br /><br />So why am I posting here? Because I guarantee for ACE. <br /><br />No, he didn&#039;t ask me to do this, he will probably be surprised. But meeting nice people down the road it&#039;s a overwhelming feeling.

				AYE AYE CAPTAIN! <br />We are sooo fucking excited and busy! got the whole team at the new base couriers are doing blank trial runs all of today, till they know their routes with their eyes closed and the pre defined secure dump locations if they are being tailed. Checking the VAC packers, replacing the HDD on the Liberte box with a removable drive and replacing the old one, draughting listings! preparing the schpeel for the vendor page. we´ve even got an R&amp;D room and a very old chemistry grad friend of mine researching such amazing delicacies as expanding the edibles range, new e-smoking drug liquids, flavored tabs, party pills with our own pressed logo, lol well that&#039;s a lie, it´s actually gonna be your logo, I really liked it so I thought we would use it on the pills, with your permission of course! I am going to get one of the drivers to go and pick up the fresh printed sheet we discussed the other day and first test shipment will go out to you. Hopefully by the end of monday we should have the trial orders packaged and ready to ship! We are going to get a proper envelope printer on Monday as the current HP business one is taking too long to manually feed and print an envelope / address label / company logo. <br />Were are going to start at introducing one item a week, <br />first will be acid, second opium, 3rd dmt, etc.... sales will start out small, This is the first time weve done anything but street sell, I want it to be slow, with no rush and no mistakes. build up is good, rush is bad<br />gotto run as the safe we obtained needs to be installed down the street and we need to go get the last opium delivery! <br /><br />Will check in monday unless I have a free second in between! <br /><br />Thanks Gang<br />ACE<br /><br />
