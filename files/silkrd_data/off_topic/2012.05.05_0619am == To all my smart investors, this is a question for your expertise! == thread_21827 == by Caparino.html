				As we all know, world currency is about to plunge in the upcoming years starting somewhere around the end of this year. I&#039;m not feeding into any 2012 apocalypse bullshit. I&#039;m just politically and historically aware enough to realize that soon after the 2012 U.S. Presidential elections, WW3 will be upon us; if you&#039;ve studied historical proceedings enough it&#039;s all but apparent. As my economically aware fellows might&#039;ve realized, gold, silver, and other precious metals will carry true value in the near future.<br /><br />So I ask you, not only for me but for others who might be wondering: What&#039;s the best place to both buy and store gold?

				Have you looked into bitcoin mining hardware?&nbsp; Pays for itself + 20-50% in the first year. Not only that, but you get clean coins with no paper trail linking to you, unless you mine the block yourself, and you&#039;d need a whole lot of hardware for that.

You set up a holding company outside your home country.<br /><br />2. You go DIRECTLY to either a mine or a refinery (the best ones are mines with refineries attached) and buy the gold bullion direct from them but make sure it is stamped and certified so you can resell. <br /><br />3. You sit on the gold until the value increases to a point where you want to sell it. You should monitor the gold-value fluctuations via the commodity market and basically either bet on the value of the gold appreciating/depreciating in value or simply sell it when the value is high or demand increases rapidly. <br /><br />4. You sell it via your holding company.<br /><br />HOWEVER with all this being said I personally would not go for gold, I would go for either Platinum or diamonds. If you really want to make top-bollock cheddar then Platinum and diamonds is the way to go, it&#039;s also a good idea to look into rubies and emeralds. <br /><br />My 2 cents. :)

				All good in the hood man. :) You will need to have some cash behind you to get into it but that&#039;s not really the issue. The issue is going to SA and finding a decent supplier. SA is mineral rich though so once you dig you will find gold so-to-speak lol.
