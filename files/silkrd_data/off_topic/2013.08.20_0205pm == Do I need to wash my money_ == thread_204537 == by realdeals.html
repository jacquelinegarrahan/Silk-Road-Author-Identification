If people start asking questions what are you going to say? Where are you going to say the money comes from?<br /><br />Are you declaring it? If not then they can already have you on a count of tax evasion (that is a jailable offence on its own) after they are aware of the tax evasion they might take a closer look at you, and how long before you slip up and they nail you with product? Please be careful. <br /><br /><br />Please for the love of god, get down a SOLID money laundering plan before you begin vending. However, you are a student. Why don&#039;t you just get your money in cold hard cash? Probably the easiest way. Just save the money for the future. <br /><br />Remember you are a student. You can&#039;t live a fancy life style unless you &#039;start your own business&#039;. You want to start flashing 3000 euros around every month you better start working your ass off starting a business that you can launder through. <br /><br /><br />Be aware that the money from drug dealing is a nice thing to have, but are you smart enough to do this properly without leaving any obvious trail back to your dealing? Not everyone is and all it takes is ONE slip up and you can land yourself in between four walls for a very long time.&nbsp;
