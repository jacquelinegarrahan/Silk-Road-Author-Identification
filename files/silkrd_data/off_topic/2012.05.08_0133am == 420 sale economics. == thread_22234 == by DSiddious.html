				First of all this thought maybe has already been put into a thread i don&#039;t know i am not that much of a regular on the forums. And also it might not be true its just an idea.<br /><br />The price of a single BTC fluctuates madly a couple of weeks before the 420 sale it was around say £3.2 per BTC (roughly.) The when all these offers started poping up all over SR people must have thought i should buy buy buy while i can get more product for less £. So there was a a massive influx of people buying BTC in preparation for the sale. This pushed up the price of the BTC to around £3.5 per BTC. Might not sound like a big difference but when your talking 1000&#039;s of BTC its big money. But you have to question who were you buying your BTC off? I personally get mine of a number of websites such as Intersango etc.<br /><br />It make you think who REALLY BENEFITED of the 420 sale, the buyer who got say 10% extra product or the peoples selling the BTC? And who are they? I am sure that there is a cycle of BTC that goes from Vendor to buyer and back again. So just as an example if i buy a gram of bud for 4BTC before the sale it would have cost me at a rate of 3.2 roughly 13 GBP. During the sale if i purchased a gram of bud for 4BTC at a rate of 3.5 it would have cost me £14. So was the sale really benefiting the buyers or the people selling the BTC. WHO EVER THEY ARE?<br /><br />Just a thought.&nbsp;
