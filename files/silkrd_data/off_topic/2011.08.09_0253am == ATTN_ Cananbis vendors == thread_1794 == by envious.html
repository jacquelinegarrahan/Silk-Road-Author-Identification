				Pro tip: There is a flower button on your digital camera. Use it. Then you will be able to see the nice sparkly trichromes that everyone drools over.

				Speaking of food, I wish there were more people selling food on SR. Maybe you weed vendors could throw in a free candy bar or some beef jerky with each order.

				I would like to see more food as well. And larger portions. I have no interest in 5 cookies the size of a dime with little effect for $50+. Now if the cookies were the size of my ego and potent ;D Now we&#039;re talkin&#039;. I imagine the price would also be astronomical, hahaha. <br /><br />A little larger portions with potency is what I&#039;m looking for. I&#039;ve had some cookies and brownies in Colorado one time and..... WOW! They were serious!! Made with very high medical grade marijuana. The effects lasted for hours. Honestly, I was still messed up 6 hours later. Feeling GREAT. And I didn&#039;t eat a lot of goodies. Way better than smoking!! That&#039;s what I am looking for, potency with good taste. <br /><br />So... Who has the best tasting, longest lasting, goodies for sale? Cookies, brownies, hard candies, muffins, ect?

				When my stuff is up I can honestly say I have the biggest cookies. I would conjecture them as the strongest but I have no tried everyone&#039;s on here. I could be wrong. But I do know my biggest have 3.5 - 5 grams a cookie of very very high quality bud (equivalant in butter of course!) <br /><br />My butter is made slowly : ) Crock-Pot. And My baker has gone to school for baking : D I&#039;ll have candy soon. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				The current GreenCo camera SUCKS<br />They have been though like 3 of them. One was good but it has since been misplaced. The guys who take the picture are not the same guys who post the ad, which is also a problem. Point taken, it is on the agenda.

				Canon Digital Rebel xTI - worth every penny and pretty cheap now.&nbsp; Great for garden/flower shots. I honestly recommend any grower get one. Great for documenting or advertising. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Thanks for the tip Envious, I borrowed some chick&#039;s camera for my photos but had no idea what I was doing, as is probably evident by my pictures.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do better on my next crop.
