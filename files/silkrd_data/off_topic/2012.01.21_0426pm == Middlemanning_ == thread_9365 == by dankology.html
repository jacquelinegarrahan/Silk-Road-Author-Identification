				So ive got quite a few people back where i used to live who pay 325-400 an ounce for decent chronic, I was thinking I could set them up with some grade a medical for a reasonable price (325-350) and I will buy the ounce from SR and have it shipped directly to them, and they pay me.&nbsp; That way I never handle anything illegal, hell, i never even see it.&nbsp; I just do the transaction and make my profit.&nbsp; Thoughts?&nbsp; Im sure other people here do this, let me know your experiences.

				As long as you sort out a policy for non-arrivals I don&#039;t see why not. They&#039;re going to want the money back off you, so you should probably give it to them then sort out a refund from the vendor.

				Yes, this is a legitimate way of doing business called &quot;dropshipping&quot;, but as fred says best think of a way to deal with non-arrivals (the only way I haven&#039;t gone into this business myself)

				Dropshipping is actually my business model right now. I used to be a face to face operator, did that for 2 years years, built my customer base up from scratch to getting rid of over a kilo a week, then started getting lazy with my methods resulting a very close shave with the law, forcing me to clean up my act. When you start thinking the law won&#039;t catch up with you, you get cocky, when you got cocky you get lazy, and when you get lazy you come very fucking close to getting caught.<br /><br />This business just pays too well to get out of it completely.<br /><br />If you&#039;re planning on dropshipping, devise a way for your customers to pay you anonymously. I won&#039;t go into my own methods on a public forum, but there are many ways you can go about this. The reason for not going around taking cash from people is two-fold: a) if the person you&#039;re supplying somehow comes to the attention of the law, you don&#039;t want to be seen associating with them, much less taking money from them, and b) if things do somehow come back to you and you&#039;ve been seen by police collecting money, they may try to make a case for &#039;conspiracy to supply a controlled substance&#039;, which at least in the UK and UK derived law systems, usually carries a heavier sentence than actually physically possessing and supplying.<br /><br />I&#039;m actually making more money now supplying 6 customers than I was supplying over 50 due to the great prices on SR, the quality and reliability of the product, and the crazy prices locally for low grade shit. My guys supply better quality for a lower price, and are eating up the markets. Just be prepared for potentially long waiting times going through customs. Sometimes a package takes a week, sometimes it can take 3. The client may want a refund during that time, which ideally you should provide, allowing him/her to pay you if/when the product eventually arrives.<br /><br />Mr. Ouid&#039;s insurance policy is excellent in case of packages not arriving (I&#039;ve found his service to be top notch, although I&#039;ve only ordered from one other vendor on here so I can&#039;t say anything about other vendor&#039;s services.)<br /><br />The way I work is getting between 50 and 75% of my price upfront from customers, turning it into BTC via SEPA transfer through a legitimate business account, then getting the remaining amount of money from the customer when the product comes in. If, say, one package out of 3 doesn&#039;t arrive, you can afford to re-imburse the customer from the money you received upfront from the others and still manage to turn a profit.<br />With dropshipping you always need to have a tracking number, though that pretty much goes without saying!<br /><br />(A tad drunk writing all this so it may be a bit all over the place - my apologies for that!)<br /><br />- grahamgreene
