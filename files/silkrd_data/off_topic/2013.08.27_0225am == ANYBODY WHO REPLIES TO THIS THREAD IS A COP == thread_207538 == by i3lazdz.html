				Yeah -I only accept negative karma for this.<br /><br />You would see every last one of us executed for your private glory. Sorry it didn&#039;t really work out for you with Benito.<br /><br /><br />I was there when you were kicking me. I was just some random drunk in your way.<br />I was getting the fuck smashed out of me and I looked up.<br />You were having an epiphone. Fuckin&#039; you were ecstatic. <br />That was your drug. That is why you are here.<br /><br />YOU ARE ALL COPS FUCK YOU!!!!!!!

				How are you not banned yet? You go around deliberately trolling and causing drama.<br /><br />On topic: This thread is completely useless, though I do have sympathy for you if this is true.

But truthfully, I don&#039;t think you are a cop. YOU ARE TOO STUPID.<br /><br />Although that same night when you were beating the shit out of me. My neighbors saw you afterwords -toasting something. Drinking beers you stole from my fridge. <br /><br />FUCK YOU COP.

				You&#039;ve caught me. I am the cop, darn your smart tactics for defeating me.<br /><br />In all honesty, get help. You seem to have extreme paranoia and lack of things to do with your free time. I&#039;d suggest becoming more social and possibly getting some friends.
