				Im gonna be buying some weed this week to resell offline, but am looking for the best quality that is out there. I have narrowed it down to 2 sellers who I am going to buy from, but I still need to know what to buy.<br /><br />Was thinking of either Superbud or Purple Trainwreck, but am not sure.<br /><br />Any suggestions ?

				You&#039;ll probably get a better resell value with Purple Trainwreck simple because of the name. :D

				Depends on whether your customers prefer Sativa or Indica (Up/Energetic/Cerebral or Deep/Body High/Couch Lock).<br /><br />I personally do not like Purps or Trainwreck.. but then I have been smoking for 10+ years, and have a definitive profile of what I enjoy, and I will point out hat in most places Sativa is much less common.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Decided to keep to update this thread here and there. <br /><br />Recently got 2 strains <br /><br />Sour Diesel mix. My end customers enjoy it so far so may go back in that direction<br /><br />and some Bubba Kush which my end customers really do not like much. They say its tastes like a mid or regular grade. So more than likely will not go in that direction.<br /><br />Am going to grab a few more strains. Waiting to see if I can get my hands on the Ed Rosenthol. And now also interested in the Jack Herrer strain. <br /><br />Once I find a few strains that will rock the socks off of my end customers, I will just stick with them instead of experimenting with other strains.

				I&#039;ve only had maybe 10 named strains that I believed what they were called.&nbsp; I live in FL so we don&#039;t have dispensaries but from what I&#039;ve had I&#039;d say this:<br /><br />Budda Blue Cheese.&nbsp; This stuff is fucking amazing, before burned it smells like cheese, it seems to smell like Parm cheese and not blue cheese but still.&nbsp; It also seems to have a good volume to mass ratio.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if we got it, Cali has it and someone on here can find it.<br /><br />Close 2nd from my limited experience in preimum strains would be Sour Diesel but besides being very good IMO it has a distinct taste that is the only taste I can positively ID.<br /><br />To be real honest these are the only 2 strains I can positively ID without looking at a picture or anything just because of ones distinctive smell and the others taste.&nbsp; Around here alot of poorhustlers will just tell you whatever they have is &quot;insert strain from current rap song&quot; just to sell it so who knows if the Couch Lock, Train Wreck and Silver Haze I got last year really was.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get the cheese, trust me.

				Waiting on some Jack Harer now. Hoping my people like it. Had got a few ozs of some brick from a seller here the other day also. Sold it for dirt cheap.<br /><br />Plan is to shop around for a strain my customers will love and then stick with one or 2 sellers for that point.

				From my experience (if you aren&#039;t in a med state) stuff that&#039;s purple, or crazy looking always fetch a higher price and people tend to enjoy them more even if they aren&#039;t as powerful as other strains.&nbsp; Something about seeing purple weed makes everybody lose their shit.

But most people just call the shit they got by the best name they can think and people go for it. Thats why I know if I can get some real good good from here I can pretty much corner the market and sell to my normal customers and other sellers.<br /><br />Anything exotic here goes for $20 per gram. And if its real good I can get $20 per .8.
