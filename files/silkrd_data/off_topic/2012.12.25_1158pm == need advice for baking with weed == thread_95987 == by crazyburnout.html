				I&#039;m not so sure the &#039;just ass water&#039; stuff is the way to go, its no more complicated to get a reg box of brownies or cake mix simmer the shake into 1/2 cup of oil, add an egg or two and done &amp; done.

				I think you may be assed out bud. For tonight anyway. I suppose your going to try anyway, in which case your best bet would be to steep the shake into the correct measurment of water, be sure to account for water evaporating while boiling.

				would it be such a bad idea to replace the water with oil? i know oil is good for extracting thc like butter is but would the oil fuck up the bread?

				I&#039;m not backing any more <br />but I know butter was the best to dissolve your THC, <br />adding bananas or chocolate = adding an MAO-inhibitor, you&#039;ll have a longer, more intense experience

				actually the milk turned out great. i kept needing to add more because my original 4 cups kept evaporating. it had a super strong weed taste. i used 8 grams of trimmings/shake and i drank 1 cup at a time. it just kept knocking me out. i couldnt stay awake with that stuff

				When working with milk you should make shure not to boil it, <br />because THC evaporates below the boiling temperature of water &amp; milk (if I remember right), <br />that&#039;s one of the reasons I prefered butter, because it turns brown (burns) before you reach that temperature where THC evaporates. <br /><br />Experimenting with MAO is great fun, <br />but be warned that it can greatly prolongue the effect and make the effect much, much more intense.

				well i used a double boiler for the milk and avoided any burning. the color may have changed slightly sort of like it was evaporated milk but that could have been from the weed too. all in all i heated it for around an hour

				As I said, it&#039;s been a long time since I did it, <br />but to my opinion cooking 1 hour is WAY TOO LONG. <br />THC dissolves very easily in fat (butter) and quite quickly in milk. <br />You need to crush you weed first (make it is small as possible without heating it: don&#039;t use a &quot;kitchen robot&quot;!),<br />then you put it in the butter/milk and heat it for maybe 10 minutes... <br /><br />You might want to try it like this next time - might make a difference... <br />good luck
