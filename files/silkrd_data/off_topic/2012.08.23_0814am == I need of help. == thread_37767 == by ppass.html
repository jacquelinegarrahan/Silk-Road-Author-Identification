If you are alrght with this feel free to send it over, and I shall pay back. I have never defaulted on a debt here and I intend to keep it that way :D.<br /><br />Best Wishes

Now point me to this &quot;beggars thread&quot; . There is a difference between begging and asking for a loan. This will be the third time since I joined in February that I have started one of these threads, and it has yet to prove a negative experience for me or any other member.<br />&nbsp;I guess I could have made a more specific thread title on this one, but I still feel that I have done nothing wrong during each of these instances. Additionally, I have gone too many of these threads and shared the love around promoting some the ideals which I thought made this forum great.<br /><br />I realize the need for a separate loan sub section, but please do not confuse others begging with my request for a small loan. And please don&#039;t use my thread as a battle ground for your white knight antics, I would not do the same to you.<br />Cheers&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Well hey man, if you so feel like loaning that to me, I would gladly pay it back if you would be so kind as to provide an address after we do a loan. :D<br /><br />That would leave me with a .03 requirement which shouldn&#039;t be to hard to grab from a friend. :D<br /><br />Appreciate it.
