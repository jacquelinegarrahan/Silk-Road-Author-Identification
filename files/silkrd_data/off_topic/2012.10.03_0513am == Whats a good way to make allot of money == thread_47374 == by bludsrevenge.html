				My question sounds pretty stupid, but it isnt simply, &quot;How do I make millions tomorrow.&quot; The question, is selling drugs the most lucrative business. In the opinion of the road users, is this the best way to go, or if not, what is, according to your opinion. Of coarse I am talking about a smart person conducting business. I personally run a few legitimate business&#039;s, but is selling drugs all that?

				sell your kidneys :P jk, i personally think the drug trade on SR is very lucrative depending on what you&#039;re guna sell. If you got a niche on SR (like something that no vendors got) then forsure it&#039;ll be lucratice. Just post some your thoughts on the product offers page and see if you can get a customer base.

				seriously tho, if you get some connects with the doctors in china , you can really start your own darknet organ selling website. It only takes like 2 weeks to get a liver transplant in china whereas in america it takes like a year sometimes. <br /><br />ummm no idea man haha. Best advice: sell the drugs you know best. You dont wanna peddle something you never tried before cuz experience is gold.

SR dealers Bank; the source banks; the thing with dealing drugs is it&#039;s a form of revenue; some people get by; others achieve their desired ends and still have money to save. the people who are successful at buying from the road and redistributing lock down the colleges; tourist hotspots around the world; It&#039;s more about where u want to do it and the safety u can guarantee than it being &quot;worth&quot; the effort.

				Im not sure how lucrative SR is for vendors, but as for the drug game (in the real world, lol) its either/or. Either youre on top of your game, or you&#039;re not. I don&#039;t think that being a successful dealer is an easy job. It is fast money, and anyone can get that money selling a product that sells itself. But to get rich in the game, you strategically have to maintain longevity, consistency, attentiveness/alertness(aka paranoia), and respect. Respect is a huge factor in the drug trade, and if you can maintain a healthy respect for the business, your connect, competition, and customer base, everything will run smoothly, for the most part. With that said, you will have to be ready for anything, because you&#039;ve already looked at every situations possibilities from every angle and have accepted them by preparing for the worst and expecting the best. You have to be resourceful, goal orientated, and in a way, fearless. It really takes a certain kind of person in the right mind state to successfully be a drug dealer, and really, most people who sell drugs dont realize that... they&#039;re just in it for the money and the benefits. Every hustler ive met that has &quot;made it&quot; to the top without falling off; successfully hustling illegally to live a lavish lifestyle and then retire, told me that when it came down to it,&nbsp; they did it for the love of the game, and everything else was just a bonus. <br /><br />Really, dealing is just like any other job. Only instead of getting fired, you go to jail or get robbed or killed/end up dead (or a combination of the three). And just like any other career, you can either get &quot;promoted&quot; and move up and make lots of money for being good at what you do, or you can make the wrong decisions and suck at it and be broke.&nbsp; But, like i said, it takes a certain type of person in the right mind state to really do the damn thing. Theres rules to the game, and thats really on some true shit, not just some rap song.&nbsp; Being an intelligent person definitely helps, even better someone with a background or education in business. but to be a successful hustler, there are some things that have either been ingrained in you, or are already second nature. Karma and the respect/belief in karma, the ability to manifest, and a deep hatred for authority and the police or anyone who sides with the evil empire (ie: snitches) are a couple of examples. You also have to realize its a stressful job, and because its not a &quot;normal&quot; job in society, alot of societies &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle choices will be impossible. For example, the inability to trust someone fully will become so ingrained, it will be almost impossible to develop any sort of real romantic relationship with anyone. Friendships lose their true meaning and become more like glorified acquaintances of connects and custies based on drug addictions. Vultures pretend to really &quot;care&quot; about you on a personal level, just so youll let your guard down for them hover in your inner circle, waiting for the time you slip up long enough for them to pick at what you have. Trust nobody.<br /><br />If you know for a fact you can handle the lifestyle, and u want to stack hella cash, not give a fuck about shit, and pretty much be a gangster, SELL DRUGS. YOU WILL MAKE MORE MONEY THAN GOD. You will have so much so fast, you wont even know how to appreciate it. Just dont fuck up. Do it smart, stay humble, and youll be sitting nice watching everyone do all the work for you while you just chill. Quit when youre ahead, dont get greedy. Fuck a real job.

				<br /><br />I was very close to being rich. I bought a shitload of BTCs (around 100,000) for fuck all a couple of years ago, but had used and sold them all by early 2011. I doubled my investment and had a good time, but in retrospect, had I kept them &#039;till today I would be quite wealthy and probably very, very stoned.<br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=47374.msg500971#msg500971">Quote from: StExo on October 03, 2012, 10:57 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My statement may contradict some of posts above, and agree with others, but this is some of the approaches I&#039;ve taken in recent months as I&#039;ve been a small time recreational user, I&#039;ve had disastrous experiences with people, I&#039;ve been in the ranks when somebody has ratted us out, I&#039;ve worked up the ladder through intelligence and most of all, I&#039;ve taken everything I ever used to believe and questioned it. When you&#039;re dealing drugs in any significant quantity, especially when you&#039;re in it for the money, it is no longer a job and if you think of it that way you will fail, you will go to prison and you may even end up dead, or worse (remember some people don&#039;t care about you and if they can&#039;t take their anger out on you, they will accept your loved ones to unleash it on). Serious dealing is an entire way of life, you live your days looking over your shoulder, paranoid of everything you do, become super-critical of minor errors other people make and maybe worst of all, you have to make the decision of when you want out as it is all too easy for greed and a feeling of invincibility to take over. You can&#039;t stay in this trade forever, so you either get out rich, or get out dead.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for millions, don&#039;t expect it anytime soon without significant risk. Being a large but not a major player in the drugs trade is quite easy to do and avoid being caught, but that is because you have the money to significantly further invest in your own safety and at the same time, not make yourself priority number 1 to every LE on the planet. You may in a place where you&#039;re a big local player in the drug scene, but you&#039;re nobody on a national and certainly international level, this is where you want to be. Too big for just the local authorities to fully commit to themselves to have any chance of prosecution, but small enough to avoid the attention of the secret services and dedicated international operations to bust your ass. At the end of the day, the police will probably know you&#039;re dealing drugs and they will know it much earlier than you think, but they have to prove it before they can act, so avoiding giving them any evidence whatsoever is where it gets difficult because you won&#039;t stay completely off the radar forever.<br /><br />You also need to consider your structure. Do you want to smuggle drugs? This is incredibly profitable if you have the contacts and can put up a significant initial investment, but requires a certain type of mindset. Or do you want to just be the bulk buyer who resells onto the large dealers or even onto other distributors. This again requires an investment although not as big as smuggling, and requires strong business skills, a knowledge of the police and law and most of all, a degree of professionalism. If you&#039;re a cunt to people then you have to realise they will be smiling through their teeth at you for the money and as soon as they see an opportunity, they&#039;ll stab you in the back. Developing a working and trusting relationship whilst always remaining a little vigilant is key, because I&#039;ve found from experience when you treat everybody with respect, make them feel a part of it and reward them fairly, then they won&#039;t just work for your money, but for your trust, respect and recognition. It seems almost universal in my experience that the higher level a dealer, the more intelligent they are not in terms of just academic ability although this applies for me personally (and I have actually use this training in my business models per se), but an extremely good bit of common sense to be able to say &quot;So everyone trades this way, why, when we can do it better doing it this way *explain here*&quot;. If you&#039;ve run a legitimate business in the past, this is extremely useful as you will have a good understanding of man management which is critical if you want to make it big.<br /><br />Here is a scenario. You meet a guy who sells his &quot;product&quot; to dealers around the city who in turn sell it on again, and he currently sells it at £25/gram (no ties to any particular drug to remove drug/situation bias) to his dealers in 25-50g amounts. He purchases this at £14.50/gram when he buys 100g at a time so he makes £10.50 per gram he sells. However, suppose you can source it for £9 per gram and willing to offer him an offer of £13/gram for the exact same quality etc, you are making £4 per gram profit, correct? Seems simple. But you have to factor in exactly how are you planning to get it into the country. If it&#039;s a local guy selling bulk only then fair enough that is quite easy, but you have to factor in costs such as asking people to receive the package in their name and paying them for it, then you need ways to exchange the drug for cash without a direct transfer, so you may again need an assistant on this where you carry none of the drug on you so if you are stopped, you&#039;re clean at least.<br /><br />These extra costs can really rack up. But once you have secured this one deal and you sell maybe 1kg per week, you&#039;re making £4,000 per week minus any associated costs which isn&#039;t bad at all. But if you were to upgrade again and make more connections, would this be useful? Of course. Find another city dealer and repeat the process using minimal contact with the actual drug itself. By this point, not only do you make more sales but you need to keep up with demand so at any given time you will have a minimum of 5kg ready to move at a moments notice through a contact. At these quantities, you&#039;re now going to be able to purchase the stuff for £7.50 a gram meaning £5.50 in profit per gram not £4, demonstrating as you upscale not only do your profit margins increase (assuming you sell at the same price to the big dealers and don&#039;t offer bulk discount yourself although I do have that in my own operations) but also the quantity of the sales. Now, at 5kg a week and £5.50 profit per gram, that is £27,500 therefore by upscaling by a multiple of 5, you have increased your income by a multiple of 6.875.<br /><br />You probably know most economic theory in the drugs trade, but you must be able to do complicated maths in your head at a moments notice. All of the above calculations I done from the top of my head and I haven&#039;t actually checked they&#039;re correct to be quiet honest, but they look right to me and that is a very strong indicator my subconscious mind is giving them the thumbs up. If somebody wants to renegotiate, be a little flexible because you are faced with losing the client all together, or making 10% less profit from that particular client. I&#039;d rather make the less amount of profit as money is money. If you can&#039;t calculate the profit from buying 2kgs of a drug for £7.50/gram and reselling it to local dealers for £13/gram minus maybe £800 in operational securities (hiring others to do the dirty work so if caught, they go to prison and not you) for a deal of that size, then you need to reconsider your options. You can always take a silk road approach, but that has it&#039;s limits. I don&#039;t mind trading and doing this in the real world as for christs sake I live in London, a massive city where in some areas you can conduct shady business in the open and nobody cares but on the next street, the police would be all over you, so knowing the area is important. But you must keep it above what I call the first level, which are street dealers who sell to the users, these are the guys who get busted and are considered pawns of the trade for a reason which countless studies showing they earn very little money, whereas when you move into higher ranks, the guys are far more devoted, less likely to open their mouths (as this becomes so serious high up some other dealers will have you &quot;taken out&quot; if you do this, a non-existent concept at street level) and more reliable.<br /><br />Be ready to do some serious homework for few people will hold your hand and show you. People like myself will help to answer questions but not because I want to make you rich, but because whenever I give you an idea or template, I want you to analyze it and improve/adapt it to your own model and if it can work well with my own, I will also evolve my business to it. It&#039;s like offering a free service to the user of a website, they may receive it for free, but you are actually being paid indirectly.<br /><br />I&#039;ve missed a lot of things out here (and I mean a LOT) because there is too much to discuss and a more guided approach is definitely the way to go and rather than somebody guiding you, it is better for you to ask questions and learn quickly what type of questions to ask and how you can make the best use of the help on offer for people I&#039;ve spoke to so far are never short on questions and I don&#039;t mind answering them and explaining things no matter how long it takes, but I do notice people ask the wrong question, such as &quot;How much money do I need to get started?&quot; when really, they should be asking themselves are they ready to do this. Getting the money for initial investment is quite easy, but having the will power and determination to get into this business and remain strong in the face of adversary and bad luck is critical. The first major hurdle is always the most difficult even if it is only a simple issue, because for the first time you know a bad move will not only cost you money, but could also cost your freedom and reputation. Many fail at this, because they do not have the will to continue through difficult times, so when they face trouble, giving up becomes an attractive offer to them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />couldnt agree more on your speech.
