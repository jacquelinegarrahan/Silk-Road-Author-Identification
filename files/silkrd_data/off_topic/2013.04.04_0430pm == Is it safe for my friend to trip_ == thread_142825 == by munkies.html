				So, I&#039;ve ordered 20 lsd tabs which should be here in a few days. I&#039;ve been planning to trip with a good friend. We&#039;re both lsd newbies, I&#039;ve taken lsd 3 times, he took it twice. <br />Why I&#039;m asking this is because my friend is addicted to gambling. I&#039;ve been the only friend who tried to actually tried to talk some sense into him and make him stop. I&#039;ve been away from town for just one day, so I called him to ask what he was doing. He sounded very angry so immediately began to fear the worst. As soon as I&#039;ve left town, he went to a poker tournament and lost 50 euros. He felt like this wasn&#039;t enogh so he decided to stay for a cash game where he lost about 600 euros. Next day afternoon, he goes to a casino where he basically lost all his money, about 1700 euros. He doesn&#039;t even have any money left to pay the bills or buy food. Now he is angry and carrying his gun wherever he goes.&nbsp; Whenever he slips, loses a lot of money gambling he is always trying to blame someone else for his impulsive behavior. I think this is a sure way to a horrible trip. <br />Now the problem is, as I am out of town he will pick up the acid when it comes. With his impulsive behavior he will most likely take the tabs as soon as he opens the envelope. Both of his previous lsd experiences were pleasant and he has the false feeling that it&#039;s impossible to have a bad trip.<br />I really don&#039;t know what to do to stop him as I fear he might do harm to himself or others, I would be thankful for any advice.

				Definitely sounds like a bad combo. I assume it is not possible to cancel the order at this point. Other than calling the cops, you could see if there is someone else you can get to grab the LSD and hold on to it until you get back.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about LSD from what I have heard is that it can help with breaking addictions and changing lives, although I think you had to take a fairly large dose to get to that point. So maybe a large dose is just what needs?

				Gun + LSD + mindset...... Don&#039;t think I&#039;d be tripping with him.

				Luckly it seems he&#039;s better now, his dad sent him some cash and his girlfriend took his gun away. I&#039;ll be back in town tomorrow so hopefully things are going to turn out ok.

				if you do decide to trip with him you could use it as an opportunity to talk to him about his gambling. some experience clarity or whatever with lsd.

				Honestly, I think that he will likely be fine tripping, like ron said, it could be a opportunity for personal growth.<br />&nbsp;<br />Psychedelic crises + anti-psychotics = solution&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Keep some on hand if you can for your emergency kit.

				As long as there is no gun and the environment is right, give him a big healthy dose and use it to as an opportunity for himself to have a self-evaluation of his life, could be beneficial!
