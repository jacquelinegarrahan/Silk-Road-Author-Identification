				question in short... what was this beautiful drug.<br />when i was first introduced to &quot;molly&quot; i bought a regular sized capsule these were colored yellow, orange, purple, and green. 1 solid color and 1 small outline of a rabbit, turtle, whale, maybe another i dont know. they weighed roughly between .17 and .27g. 20-30 min in to it and there was come up as with mdma and methylone. depends on what i ate and what not. there were times it took close to an hour. after come up consisting of everthing bright and loud. BAM!!! what the fuck... music a must. touching a must. dancing a must. vision changed usually everything looked like it was made of sand. my girl and her friend sometimes their eyes would roll uncontrollably to the back of their head and mine may have a time or two. it was so intense that riding passenger would almost set a panic attack. similar to mdxx and what not dose had to be taken at once and in order to &quot;roll&quot; again you had to wait like 5-10 hrs or so. description of it. powdery first few not as clean had a brownish tint. then they started coming snow white. perfect powder no chuncks it looked like heavens floors. tasted bitter as fuck like mdxx and methylone. burnt like meth mdxx methylone when snorted. i found this to be more potent when taken orally and a waste when snorted. looked about identical to methylone but maybe without the sparkle im not sure. they say this guy moved down from new york. collected dealers money. went off cooked it up comes back and sold em in those caps. then switched to clear hot pink caps. the guy vanished but god i miss that shit. i find m1 to be closer than the mdma shards i have had. the come up is identical but that BAM!!! where the hell is it. the hard effects would last between 30min to 3 hrs just depended. and when u were &quot;rollin&quot; you were not embaressed to say or do anything. please and i am open to any ideas. mixtures. idk i just miss it. thanks you guys<br />second note: taking one in the evening would keep you up all night like meth i mean up up. after the comeup and roll straight awake for a while.<br />random update: im feeling good on some methylone when i took a quick hit of some canned air. this with the m1 high was almost identical except missing the touchy i wanna fucky part.
