				So looks like there are good sides to having 2 herniated lower back discs that press on nerve roots...<br />...went to a local pain management clinic last week (South FL), and got some scripts; after I finally found a pharmacy that carried all the meds I was prescribed, among other boring things, I walked out of there with 90 (ninety) count of 8mg Dilaudid... that&#039;s Hydromorphone thank you very much :-)<br />What was less of an epic win was having to pay $450 for it! Anyways, I tried one yesterday along with a lortab and it sure gives you a warm and fuzzies on the inside, not much for euphoria though.<br /><br />Any tips on getting the most out of it? No I will not IV...

				Up the bum, normally I wouldn&#039;t like sticking shit up there but I&#039;m sure you already have a gaping anal hole from being ass fucked by the pharmacy, having to pay $450 for a prescription is ridiculous, I hope we have a better medical reform before I&#039;m at the age I have to rely on prescriptions.

				I&#039;d say half as much as you would take orally is a general rule, might want to crush it up and maybe mix with water and use a syringe. But yea, I&#039;d say half as much as you would take orally, or even less, because you can&#039;t puke it up if you OD so it&#039;s more dangerous, but doubles your supply.

				Isn&#039;t there supposed to be euphoria with this medication? I read it&#039;s much stronger than morphine and Oxy, but I honestly enjoyed hydrocodone and oxycodone way more than this stuff, aka more warmth, itching, and general feeling of joy.<br /><br />Or it may be due to my epic fucking headache and hangover I got from taking muscle relaxants last night...<br /><br />LAME!

				Please share our experience with this medication, do you experience a lot of euphoria? Warmth? Itching?

I guess I&#039;ve had to up the dose a bit to get nice side effects. I think next time I&#039;ll ask the pain doc for Hydrocodone without Tylenol. Hydrocodone and Oxy are my top pick of opiates, but getting oxy, or asking for it will be suspicious, hydro not so much I think.
