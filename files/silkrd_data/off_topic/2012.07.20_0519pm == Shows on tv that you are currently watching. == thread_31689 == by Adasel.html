				I&#039;ve just finished watching every episode of BSG and wasn&#039;t too keen. I think 20 episodes per series is too many. The movie wasn&#039;t a movie at all either, just a long episode. Although I did really enjoy some of the more tense active episodes, particularly in the first and final fourth series.<br /><br />I&#039;m watching Suits at the moment, which is amazing. Will probably go back to re-watch Stargate when I feel like it.

				Breaking Bad is the best drama that has ever been made for TV. <br /><br />They just started broadcasting Season 5 so I downloaded and watched the first episode of the new season and it looks promising.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve never seen it then download and watch the first four seasons NOW!

				I tried Mad Men but it was a little too slow for me.&nbsp; Although the direction and the acting was superb, right down to the attention to detail of the clothes and the sets.<br />There was a scene in the first season where they are all in the board room discussing the health issues of smoking, saying how bollocks it is, then they all start coughing because the room is full of smoke.&nbsp; Pure class.<br /><br />BSG is the best thing since sliced bread.&nbsp; The fourth season was let down because the writers just didnt give a shit after the strike a couple of years back.<br /><br />Going to start watching Dexter.&nbsp; Thats a good show although a bit controversial!.

				I&#039;d love to get those old shows on DVD.<br />Ones that come to mind are the original Transformers, Mysterious City of Gold and of course, Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br />It was kicked off by someone buying me He-man on DVD.&nbsp; I&#039;ll admit i watched a couple of eps and wow, did it bring back some happy memories.<br />Nothing to be ashamed of admitting to scooby-do my friend.&nbsp; Those were great years of tv.

				Breaking Bad - Greatest show of all time, period.<br /><br />Dexter - Generally amazing though season 3 and 5 were kind of shit, upcoming season looks very promising<br /><br />Weeds - This show has honestly been milked to hell and back and is absolutely retarded now, but I&#039;ve invested too many years in it to stop now<br /><br />True Blood - Fuck you, this show is ridiculously entertaining. Lot&#039;s of homosexuality in it but it&#039;s more than made up for every time Jessica shows her tits<br /><br />Unfortunately House is over now, so that&#039;s everything currently worth watching<br /><br /><br />Oh, and Shameless too. (The US version, fuck off Limetless)<br /><br /><br />USA USA USA <br /><br />

				If you like drama &amp; smart-ass humor you gatta check out USA&#039;s new series called Suits.. <br /><br />If you haven&#039;t heard of The Game of Thrones then that&#039;s definitely something you should give a try.. at least watch the first 3 episodes and let me know if you&#039;re not hooked ;)

				Game of Thrones looked fucking awesome when it was advertised for sky.<br />Unfortunately i had to get rid of sky due to costs.<br />But are you talking about the one starring sean bean?&nbsp; He a fucking awesome actor and so overlooked.&nbsp; His big role in LOTR was way overdue.<br />I also think for some reason it was a sky production, so kudos goes to sky.&nbsp; Also the new sinbad remake looks pretty good too.

				^ Haha Yup <br /><br />It is a really good show, but there&#039;s quite a few points were the dialog was like, I could easily know what to say here, they&#039;re acting ridiculous; mostly with walt and sky, sometimes jesse. <br />I don&#039;t want to spoil anything, so stop reading, the climax of the 3rd season when walt hits that guy with the car and blows out the other dealer guy, wha-?wow<br /><br />For anyone who likes standup and hasn&#039;t seen Louie CK&#039;s show &#039;Louie&#039;, it&#039;s damn funny.

				For me the big three are The Wire, Sopranos and Breaking Bad. I started watching battlestar but got bored halfway through 2nd season. Only so much &quot;is he/she a Cylon?&quot; I can take. Game of Thrones is good, but having read all the books they are gonna need some serious editing cos it gets boring later on. Still a good story but LOTS of filler.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I loved &quot; Curb your Enthusiasm&quot; I genuinely felt sad when I ran out of those... like I was losing a friend. ( I&#039;ve got two small children; I don&#039;t get out much!) Just finished watching &quot;Modern Family&quot; very very funny. Similar to &quot;Outnumbered&quot; a British comedy. Keep meaning to watch second series of &quot;Eastbound and Down&quot;
