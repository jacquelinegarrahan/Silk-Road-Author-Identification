				Started to get into gay midget porn.. became so addicted to the idea of midgets cock slapping me all over. I decided to create a midget relic with a large mandingo cock. I decided to order 10 strips of good 25b NBOME - took about 2 over the course of several hours. I ended up burning the midget relic because I thought it was satan.. terrible trip. I have roomates and they called the police on me. Cops came - luckily I only got off with a warning. Tried so hard to hold my composure as I was tripping so hard when they arrived.. but my other roomate helped handle the situation well.<br /><br />I&#039;m a straight male.. but often fantasize about midgets. It&#039;s not even the men part.. but just how they&#039;re so tiny and the penis is not disproportional in size. They are so fascinating. How many other people experience this? I was thinking of creating a midget escort service in my area

				This isn&#039;t weird at all and rather is perfectly healthy.&nbsp; Most people that I know are at least kind of into gay midgets yet are straight males.&nbsp; I think if you set up a secret shop somewhere and let the word out on SR that you&#039;d have a booming business for yourself and others.&nbsp; GL!

				Not completely sure if it is normal.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that I am going to watch gay midget porn to find out.&nbsp; If it is normal, I dodged a bullet.
