				rating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freshness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br />1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never arrived. Accidentally clicked the finalize anyway and release funds button but it was to late to cancel it. Fuck me.<br /><br />Oh by the way. Ive had on failed delivery due to Refusal because of mixed up address which I toooookkkkk real good care of.<br /><br />Further to that this guys&nbsp; DCN shows delivered<br /><br /><br />Apparently Mr. Above Commenter Jumped his hypothetical gun before deciding to give me a 1/5 for an error he clearly admits too. So lets tell you a story about Mr below mentioned 1/5<br /><br />His very first message to me read as follows <br />&quot;salad123 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just placed an order with you. Should I expect an envelope or a box?<br />Also, anything you can do to make sure the product is concealed well would be greatly appreciated. There is a slim chance a family member will open it.&quot;<br /><br />My first mind is that this was a kid who was scared mommy was gonna find the weed he ordered from super secret website in the mail. Ht them cancels the order and send me an order with an address I wouldn&#039;t have to worry about being compromised as mentioned above. Funny thing is I&#039;ve only had on failed delivery due to a refusal caused by n error on the post offices behalf. Now should I ask the individual this incident occurred with, he will gladly come on here and explain that it was a misunderstanding and how well he was compensated for our mishap. But you, you are the scum of the fucking earth. You don&#039;t even wait to verify if this item was delivered to which I assume is a &quot;friends: house, or someone you thought was a friend. Please consider all the circumstances before you just jump the gun and 1/5 someone. I bet your buddy M.C. is enjoying your bud right as we speak.
