				Hey everyone,<br />I&#039;ve always had problems talking to new people, I think i have a really mild disturbance of anxiety in public. I say mild because I can tlak to people - just not START talking to people.<br /><br />Now, the more i read about benzos - it looks like this is a magical drug for me that will stop making me so nervous in public places.<br /><br /><br />Anyone in my situation experienced this ? resolved it?<br /><br />Thanks!

				are you male? <br /><br />may sound like a dumb question but if so... dont wank for a week.<br /><br />sounds dumb but maintains testosterone levels in your body, you&#039;ll feel more confident in social situations. no drugs needed.<br /><br />hell I stopped for five days and at work i was sparking up conversation with people even when it wasn&#039;t needed<br /><br />doesn&#039;t work for everyone, but drugs aren&#039;t always the solution to problems. not trying to offend you in anyway

				I&#039;m a newbie here but I can relate.&nbsp; I have self image issue; even though my partner says I&#039;m good looking, growing up, I&#039;ve been bullied that took my image and self confidence down.&nbsp; Anyway my head is huge okay?&nbsp; My name, my image all were made fun of.&nbsp; But over the years I learned making fun of myself really eases from taking criticism and if anyone were to say anything negative about it.<br /><br />My point, if there&#039;s something you don&#039;t like about yourself whether it&#039;s your looks or just self confidence, find out why and tackle it.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be the nice guy with nice-guy-syndrome that roots back to growing up with a single mother and putting women on a pedestal.&nbsp; If social anxiety is just your thing then there are plenty of ways to let go of yourself and not care.&nbsp; I stopped caring few years ago.&nbsp; It helps a lot.&nbsp; Sometimes you have to be a complete dick (not sure if you can swear here) especially if someone doesn&#039;t like you or go against your philosophy.&nbsp; You only live once.&nbsp; F them.&nbsp; That&#039;s the attitude you need.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m no super Type-A guy but not going to sugar coat it for you either.&nbsp; Drugs are temporary man...work out (if anything bulk up with some stuff safely), go out and talk to people, make mistakes, be embarrassed but every experience will just make you one step forward to being more social.

They will also impact your general thinking and motor abilities which makes them unsuitable for anyone with less than severe anxiety. They&#039;re also highly addictive.<br />Phenibut might work for you. It does for me :)

				I am male, yes.<br /><br />Thanks everyone, for the replies. I would definitely not try benzos for this situation.<br /><br />The thing is, just like others said here, people claim I have the looks and if i only had the confidence - I would get who ever i want.<br />I do workout, 3 times a week for the last 5 years.<br />My appearance is not a problem, the fact that i can not talk to a girl that smiles to me in an elevator - that&#039;s the problem.<br /><br />I find alcohol really works and help me loosen up - I can maintain a conversation, but I cant start one. but those days of parties and alcohol is done for me.

				Some benzos will make you more able to talk to people but they won&#039;t make you able to start conversations IMO. They kind of suck for that purpose I think because they give you slightly slurred speech, more difficulty following a conversation and the sedation makes you less likely to start a conversation. They basically just make you not care but they don&#039;t make you outgoing. They make you disinhibited but sounding and looking sedated isn&#039;t very good in conversations anyways.<br />If the problem is that you just aren&#039;t outgoing and not that you feel frightened when around people or when people talk to you then benzos won&#039;t help much. Benzos may just make you feel more comfortable because you don&#039;t give a shit but you won&#039;t talk that much more.<br /><br />Something that will really make you talk to strangers is speed :P It&#039;s amazing how conversations flow easily while on speed, but its side effects aren&#039;t very nice. Modafinil and piracetam/aniracetam seems like a healthier alternative to both speed and benzos that may work pretty well too but I&#039;ve never tried that.
