				It should be well out of your system in a month, Marijuana usually never stays in your system for the than a month from when you last smoked. But just as precaution, just drink lots of water and cranberry juice and you&#039;ll be great.

				Part of my job for 8 years was urinalysis.&nbsp; What they test for is metabolites which remain in your body for a period of time.&nbsp; If you smoke heavily and regularly, even the basic tests will find it up to 30 days later.&nbsp; If you smoke occasionally, you might even piss clean the day after.&nbsp; The metabolites of THC build up in your blood over time, so you are wise to quit now and be safe.&nbsp; Follicle tests are a weird one, marijuana traces can migrate along the hair shaft and show up just about anywhere...&nbsp; So dating your last use is impossible, but proving you used is easy.&nbsp; If you suspect a follicle test, shave your head and let it grow in to about 2cm, have it cut into a high&amp;tight or some other normal short hair style a couple of weeks prior so you arent clean cut when you go in. That morning, cleanse it thoroughly with alcohol gel (sanitizer) followed by good soap and water (not bs shampoo), then apply an odorless hand cream containing dimethacone (check ingredients list) and work it in thoroughly to the skin to prevent sebum from traveling up the shaft and carrying metabolites.&nbsp; Wipe your head well with a towel, to leave a thin layer of dimethacone without leaving your hair noticeably greasy.&nbsp; Be careful not to scrub hard or cause abrasions to the scalp which would release further evidence onto the hair.&nbsp; Thorough does not mean belt sander.&nbsp; Also see LE equipment providers like &quot;Alternate Force&quot; for specifications on common urine tests, you&#039;ll see how long many of them are good for.&nbsp; Paying lab techs is expensive, so they generally get some &#039;certification&#039; (which means jack but makes their tests legal) and use field test kits which suck.&nbsp; Being dehydrated can increase the solid % in your urine, so drink lots of water the last week at least.<br /><br />If only urine, don&#039;t smoke til then and forget about it.

				If you truly are a *medical marijuana* user, with a valid recommendation, why would you need stop to pass a test? I&#039;d think if you brought in your recommendation along with you when you are tested, you&#039;d be fine.

				I have recently (12 weeks ago) found out that my company has switched occupational health providers and the new provider BUPA uk perform the standard 5 drug test as part of my periodic medical (problem is I do not know when it will be)&nbsp; I grow and smoke quite a lot of quality weed, but when I found out about the test I decided to try and clean up my system and quit for 4 weeks, cycled too/from work daily (sweating) and overdosed on vitamin b3 regularly ( causes skin flushing, apparently good for detox)<br />&nbsp; After 4 weeks I was still self testing positive and could no longer be bothered to abstain (first smoke after 4 weeks was bliss) as such I have decided that urine substitution is the way to go.<br />&nbsp;If during the test you get to visit the toilet unaccompanied then its child&#039;s play.&nbsp; I have frozen clean urine (donated from a friend) in my freezer ready to go when I get the call&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( after the thaw it should be filtered to remove slight sediment) Thawing this small volume ( 60ml) can be done relatively quickly in a cup of hot water.<br />Filtered piss is then put into a non-lubricated condom (will not taint piss with foreign smell) and stashed in underwear along with a hand warmer (chemical type) this helps keep the temperature in the correct range 98-96f. ( tester will expect pee 92-95f approx)<br />On test day when in the cubicle simply cut the tit from the condom with small scissors stashed in sock and transfer to the sample jar, I intend to use a strip type thermometer ( the kind used to test for fevers, on children&#039;s forehead) to verify temperature is correct prior to exiting the cubicle and handing it in for testing.<br />&nbsp; My research found that temperature and smell are pretty important in substitution as they are basic markers looked for by the tester, also volume should not be less than 2 fl/oz.<br />I have practiced the whole process with wifey playing the test nurse so that its all strait in my head for the big day and truly believe its the way forward, <br />&nbsp; All the best anyhow, and good luck. <br />&nbsp;

				DRINK A SHIT LOAD OF WATER AND EXERCISE&nbsp; STOP SMOKING MAYBE START DRINKING BEERS (THATS HIS LIQUID SO IT HELPS CLEAN YOUR SYSTEM OUT LOL)<br /><br />Exercising is important though, it under valued when trying to cleanse your system.
