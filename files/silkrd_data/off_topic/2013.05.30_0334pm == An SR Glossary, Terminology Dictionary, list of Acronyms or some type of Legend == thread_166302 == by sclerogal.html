				I still fall under the newbie status at least for another 15 posts or so. I&#039;m not sure if understand some of the terminology about drugs, SR processes, and general terms on here unless I directly ask.&nbsp; Is there anywhere here or else where a terminology legend, glossary?&nbsp; For example, I didn&#039;t know negging or neg someone meant giving bad Karma.&nbsp; I wish there were ways for us newbies to understand the terminology used on SR forums. Anyone have any ideas?

				Here is some:<br /><br />Neg/Negging (I know that one)<br />Troll/Trolling<br />Chinese Whisper<br /><br />As I see them I&#039;ll post here.&nbsp; You know, I really can&#039;t believe how helpful people are on the SR forums?&nbsp; There are even topics on over coming loneliness, depression and isolation.&nbsp; I even saw a thread on suicide. I wish the outside forums where this helpful.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really see people insulting each other especially when asking&nbsp; for help. Of course there a some very heated debates, but they are here like everywhere else. I am impressed by this site.

				Vendors - Sellers<br />Buyers - Purchasers<br />DPR - Creator and anonymous leader of SR<br />FE - Finalizing early on a purchase (finalizing early takes the item out of secure payment method and the sole trust of item goes on vendor , if item does not arrive the buyer has very limited chance of getting any sort of refund , most people avoid but it is your decision , some vendors request FE.<br />In Transit - Self explanatory , product has been marked as posted from vendor on way to address of buyer<br />Stealth - How good the item was posted and how good the hiding techniques from authorities were<br />OS - Overseas<br />BTC - Bitcoin<br /><br />Probably many more I forgot.
