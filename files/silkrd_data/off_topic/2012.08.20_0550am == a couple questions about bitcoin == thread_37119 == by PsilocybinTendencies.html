				Having been watching btc ever since discovering silk road, I couldn&#039;t help but notice that the way btc is fluctuating, it&#039;s easy money to be made... or so it seems...<br /><br />When I started here it was like 4 bucks a coin. I see now if I had bought a bunch and sat on it id have almost tripled my money.<br /><br />So I was thinking about abstaining from buying drugs for as long as I possibly can, and instead saving up for a bitcoin mega splurge as soon as I see it hit three bucks. I figure it would have to rise again sometime.<br /><br />Am I missing anything? Is there any reason this doesn&#039;t sound like a wise course of action?<br /><br />Suppose I do it and decide to cash out, I&#039;ve never done that before. How does the cashing out process work? Help!!!

If you can wait a bit, it seems like a decent bet.<br /><br />Remember they started at something like $0.05 per BTC.. We&#039;re still in early days.

I feel like I&#039;ve stumbled onto one hellacious investment opportunity. lol.<br /><br />What if I wanted to cash out? I have no idea how to go about that. Seeing as how I wouldn&#039;t have done anything illegal I guess I&#039;d be okay with linking my identity... I realize that&#039;s something people don&#039;t like to discuss publicly but if I could just get pointed in the right direction...

				I haven&#039;t given it too much thought, if it&#039;s massively successful and continues to grow - options for cashing out will grow too.<br /><br />More than likely however, for me, any upside will just subsidize my drug consumption&nbsp; :-\ Which would be fucking excellent.<br /><br />Price is dropping as we speak, loading another xk to keep as &#039;dry powder&#039; incase of any crazy-ass surprise drops, I&#039;ll be sitting waiting.
