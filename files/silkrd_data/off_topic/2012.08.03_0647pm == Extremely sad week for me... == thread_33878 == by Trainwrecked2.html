				First off, this whole not being able to log into my account thing is driving me nuts.&nbsp; I would post this off my original forum account but I keep getting that whole error message that everyone else is getting.&nbsp; Been trying all day.<br /><br />I was fucked, bad.&nbsp; I know I was an idiot.&nbsp; I talked with someone who contacted me on the forums here, under the name of onlythebest.&nbsp; We have been talking for about a month or so now, negotiating a deal in regards to large supplies of LSD for a good price.&nbsp; At first I was skeptical, since it was outside of SR and not in escrow, but after he explained not only the entire process, but kept in contact with me regarding other deals and we had things set up for me to source him some stuff too, I placed an order with him.&nbsp; He asked for the payment to be thru MP, so I provided him with MP for a sheet at $450 laid with White Fluff.&nbsp; Took me weeks to work up the money, since I lost my job some time ago due to the economy and the weather conditions.&nbsp; I had high hopes with this, because I was supposed to make 700-800 bucks off of this (I had customers lined up to buy it all at $10 a hit).&nbsp; He shipped it on Wednesday, he said, and that it would be here within a day or two.&nbsp; Well, I&#039;m almost positive it was a scam now.&nbsp; I went to go email him on purchasing some MXE from him next, and his email no longer exists and his forum account on here is gone.&nbsp; Instantly, I knew....&nbsp; I just lost this money.&nbsp; This has literally fucked me over, completely.<br /><br />I really don&#039;t know what to do...&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about trying to scam people myself to make up the difference, but my conscience tells me no.&nbsp; So the best I can do is at least tell you guys what happened, and hope some people learn from my experience...&nbsp; I&#039;ve been around for awhile and this just really sucks...&nbsp; All I&#039;ve wanted is some good, quality LSD for a great price so I can spread the love among my friends.&nbsp; I just continue to get fucked in every which way as I try to do this.&nbsp; I know I was an idiot, I know this was solely my fault for going outside of escrow and dealing with someone outside of SR...&nbsp; I just don&#039;t know what to do...<br /><br />Out of the kindness of your hearts, if you can please spare some extra coins or cash, I&#039;d really appreciate it.&nbsp; Anything helps.&nbsp; I&#039;m not expecting much, if anything.&nbsp; But I&#039;m desperate and I could really use the help...&nbsp; I put my bitcoin address to my signature.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how, but I&#039;ll find a way to make it up to anyone who donates.&nbsp; Just message me if you do, and I&#039;ll figure out a way...<br /><br />Thank you for your time...

				Dont ask people to pay for your own mistakes, its your own burden. <br /><br />I just find it stupid and annoying that you had the balls to offer people a product not yet in your possession. All your doing is putting more pressure on yourself by doing this, because your trying to make promises you might not be able to keep - such as this case. <br /><br />I bet you&#039;ve never sold LSD before and just thought, OMG STREET PRICE OMG SR PRICE ???? PROFIT. <br /><br /><br />

				You say you&#039;ve &quot;been around here for awhile&quot;, can you add anymore info about your old account? For all we know you could just be some new guy trying to make $$$ for your first purchase....<br /><br />Although if you&#039;re a well-respected member whose been around here for a while, then I&#039;m sure there would be people willing to help out.

				Trainwrecked is the username I go by on here.&nbsp; If I could get it to login without that error problem, I&#039;d just respond on here myself.&nbsp; I&#039;m not some higher up person, but I have been around for a bit and made a decent little bit of purchases.&nbsp; The donation address below goes directly to my SR account that I currently use.

				I definitely feel for you man...it sucks, but don&#039;t try to scam other people in order to earn back the money you lost.&nbsp; Why would you want to put someone through all the shit that you&#039;ve been through?

				hat really sucks man, I&#039;m sorry to hear that. My advice is to focus on getting a legal job and working hard at that. Starting to sell drugs when you don&#039;t really have any windfall for unexpected hits like this is a poor business strategy. Every seller whether legal or illegal should have a bit of cash stashed away just in case times get tough. Good luck getting back on your feet though.

				That&#039;s why I said it was a thought that crossed my mind but I had that exact thought, that I&#039;d never want to put anyone thru what I was just put thru.&nbsp; I&#039;m an honest person, and I couldn&#039;t live with myself if I did.&nbsp; Hence why I just posted this and was COMPLETELY honest about the entire situation.&nbsp; I figured if I was at least completely honest, maybe some people would be willing to help.&nbsp; And even if nobody helps, at least I was honest.
