				Hey hetero guys-<br /><br />I&#039;m a dude that looks like a chick. I am not, however, into heteronormative males but would rather fuck a dude who also looks like a chick.<br /><br />My question is- how pissy do you get when you find out a &#039;lady&#039; is really a dude? Considering how often I get confused as female I worry about running into some hetero dude who gets real pissed.<br /><br />I have no desire to make you accidentally fuck me, I&#039;m just genuinely curious- is your response to a &#039;trap&#039; just to find a way out of there, or do you get pissed?

				If I was even remotely invested in either alcohol, time, drugs or conversation with you and you have a penis and played the role of a female whatsoever I&#039;m going to beat the fuck out of you. Period. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been drunk in too many dimly lit bars in my time, and the only time this is happened I ended up beating up two trannies in an alley while I was the most coked out I&#039;ve ever been in my life...<br /><br />

				As long as you weren&#039;t leading me on I&#039;d be fine. If you were hitting on me in the hopes of trying to trick me, I&#039;d be pretty pissed, but I&#039;d never hit you.<br /><br />sdesu

				If you actually look like a girl like you say you do, lucky you! I wish to be the little girl. Unfortunately I&#039;m quite manly.<br /><br />As for the other part...I think it depends on how girly you really are. It also depends how secure they are with their sexuality. I have a few friends that would run away, but others like myself who would probably be pretty interested, despite being straight. At the very least I wouldn&#039;t worry about getting hurt if you actually look like a woman, not a man dressed up as one.

Or, whatever. Any man, or woman, that is lead to believe an individual is one gender versus another by way of deception; or withholding the truth... is going to be pissed when they don&#039;t &quot;find what they&#039;re looking for.&quot; <br /><br />I&#039;ll tell you, as a man, no homo, I&#039;d be 10 times more likely to fuck a &quot;chick with a dick&quot; knowing what I was doing, than to &quot;romantically&quot; or &quot;passionately&quot; be involved if and when I found said penis which you were not telling me about. I would likely kick you in the throat. Just saying... If a woman was seduced by a handsome, manly man... and then went to suck a dick, and found a Vagina; they&#039;d be pretty disappointed. However, I know plenty of &#039;straight&#039; girls who have/would go down on other girls. <br /><br />Keep it real; or most people will keep it &#039;realer&#039;&nbsp; ;D

But I&#039;m not going to begin to pretend to know what that&#039;s all about. I would not be offended if I approached you, and was &quot;excuse me&quot; ... and then realized you were a guy. I&#039;d be like, &quot;silly me&quot; .... &quot;Wanna get it in the butt?&quot; ... JK. ;D<br /><br />But, seriously, one would only be offended if they were 1. Seduced, and lead to believe you were female with the intend of providing... Vagina...&nbsp; or 2. Some redneck or sexist idiot who can&#039;t stop stressing over every little thing in life.

No need to be hostile unless I felt I was tricked. Then I&#039;d be more disgusted and upset, but I don&#039;t think I would resort to violence unless I felt like I was being physically forced. Also it would depend on if I was on alcohol or drugs. <br /><br />As was said before, just be honest with people and you&#039;ll see that good things will come to ya. :)
