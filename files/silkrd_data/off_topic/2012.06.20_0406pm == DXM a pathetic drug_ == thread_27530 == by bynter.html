				Seems like most experienced drug users look down upon it. Like once I was late night tripping, and when I started talking to some stoners. When I told them I was on DXM, they laughed, and were be telling me &quot;Robotrip from the comfort of your own home.&quot; Many others also seem to look down upon, as though the effects aren&#039;t as intoxicating as they are. Though considering Ive never done anything harder, maybe i just don&#039;t know what a serious high.&nbsp;

				I tried dxm in grade 8 before I knew where to buy weed. Its not that dxm isn&#039;t powerful, it certainly can be. The fact that its otc implies, oh you just don&#039;t know where to get real drugs. I would say that in my experience dxm is pretty gross, and not as much fun as any illegal drug I can think of. I remember it being really a weird experience. If there were any reason to look down on it, it would be the perception that dxm is kiddie stuff, the same way that someone who does a lot of speed or shoots meth would look at someone who is bragging about their adderall prescription and would say, oh thats kiddie stuff.

				Yeah, it has been my experience as well that DXM has the reputation of being for kids with coughs and sniffles. <br />Usually the &quot;pathetic&quot; accusations originate from: <br />1) inexperienced users of DXM<br />2) people who&#039;ve taken syrup and not gels/powder&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />3) people who&#039;ve not exceeded 300mg in dose<br /><br />The drug itself, is widely available and legal, which I think makes it paradoxically less desirable to some.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We would have injected vitamin C if only they had made it illegal</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Robotrip from the comfort of your own home.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I certainly wouldn&#039;t like a group of people in my home all on 900mg DXM.

				I agree with ZA6wUw8a most of the people who talk down about DXM either haven&#039;t had the full experience or associate it with stupid high schoolers who will try just about anything to get high.<br /><br />I have done it a few times, I just don&#039;t really like it very much. It feels harder on the body than MXE or Ketamine, so those are my choices for disassociating should I feel the need to. Although DXM does seem to take you to a different place than MXE or Ketamine take you to.

				Tried DXM once that was enough for me, seems heavy on the body and mind without any pleasantness, just an intoxicated heavy cross eyed ride. Dosed to hit the third plateau but it just sucked, people came over and I could hardly see straight and slurred my speech like a massive mxe dose.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				DXM is considered pathetic because it&#039;s the active ingredient in several brands of cough syrup. BEcause of that, it has a stigma that the only people who might want to take it are stupid kids who can&#039;t get other drugs because they don&#039;t know any dealers and are too young to buy booze.<br /><br />Also, because robotripping is horrible and disgusting, all that gunk in the syrup makes for a horrible body load that even extends towards the next day. I only did cough syrup recreationally once, several years ago, and to this day the smell of it gets my gag reflex going. I can&#039;t even take normal doses for actually suppressing cough and I feel sick.<br /><br />That said, if you can get your hands on pure DXM, it&#039;s a great replacement for ketamine or MXE. Before I got in the habit of meditating, I loved to mix DXM powder in my shroom tea to boost the trip. But IMO once you learn to silence your body and mind, it becomes redundant. It might still be good because of the famous &quot;afterglow&quot; - I remember that it would put a huge spring in my step for the two or three days following my using it.<br /><br />So, in sum, the stigma is retarded - but if you apply it only to &quot;DXM-containing cough syrup&quot; instead of to &quot;DXM&quot; in general it&#039;s a lot less retarded.

				DXM is a pretty unique dissociative and gets less credit than it deserves. It has been really fun for me– I&#039;ve had stretches where I did it a few days in a row. But after that, I sortof felt above it. It&#039;s become more of a desperation drug. I&#039;d never do it if there was ANY other drug around (aside from weed; it goes amazing with weed).

				I&#039;ve done a number of drugs including DXM, which I tried after cannabis, nutmeg, ecstasy and I believe LSD. <br /><br />After doing it again recently I have to say it&#039;s a pretty pathetic drug, for me anyway. It reduces me to a useless sack of blind, numb, nauseous shit. I don&#039;t know why I even tried upping my dosage to 600mg one day. It&#039;s a waste of money and time at least in my eyes. Though I am also quitting about 3 years of cannabis use so I may be taking on a different view of drugs in general. <br /><br />I just don&#039;t think it has any benefit. Who knows I may try some pure product here on the road and see where it takes me. Can anyone compare Ketamine to DXM? DXM has turned me off to Ketamine which I have seen described, and from what I saw and heard sounded awesome. After taking DXM however and lying on the couch not being able to feel my toes, fingers and crotch I just don&#039;t know. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />-Liquid Eater&nbsp;

It&#039;s serious fucking business. It has less of an afterglow, lasts for way shorter and is way more intense. Their quality is different in a way that&#039;s a bit hard to describe, but you could say that DXM is more sensorial (visuals, numbness, etc) while ketamine is more of a mindfuck. They both throw your motor skills to shit while in effect though, so from the outsider&#039;s perspective a guy tripping on either one is the same.<br /><br />To me, the great thing about dissociatives is mixing a little bit of them with a big bit of psychedelics. That&#039;s where the magic happens.

				I think a good way to describe ketamine is that it&#039;s fucking confusing. It only lasts an hour so I wouldn&#039;t call it a trip, but I redose like every 40 minutes and just keep going deeper and deeper.

				In cough syrup it feels nasty, and, well, syrupy. In a really bad way. Fucked up my motor skills more than K.<br /><br />Parachuting powder felt cleaner but not any more positive or helpful or good in any way. It just... was.<br /><br />There&#039;s zero reason to take DXM when you could take almost anything else, imo. Especially since I&#039;ve had two friends who battled (and defeated) DXM addiction but on the way there they&#039;d get excited when they had cough syrup or powder, take it, and be horridly depressed and self-loathing halfway through.

I&#039;m not a snob, I&#039;m just sensible. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Comparing DXM to huffing freon or duster is just stupid. DXM has a mechanism of action that is separate from &quot;brain cells dying from asphyxiation&quot;.&nbsp; I think DXM is a pleasant enough drug, but I do think it can cause&nbsp; bad long term side effects if it is used frequently. I think ketamine and DXM are similar, but with ketamine being better in every single possible way. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Indeed! Comparing DXM to huffing shit makes you sound like that daft bitch Lionheart from the DEA (YouTube - Polis Questions DEA On Marijuana Policy). I like DXM when you want something a bit darker than K but don&#039;t like MXE. It combines well nice with Bing/MD/Meph.

				DXM is my personal favourite drug. It is literally the MOST useful drug to have in your stash at all times.<br /><br />It can be used to potentiate opiates greatly, and taking a normal medicinal dose daily reduces tolerance buildup.<br /><br />It can be used by itself as a stimulant (1st plateau), an MDMA substitute (2nd Plateau), a psychedelic (3rd Plateau) or an 8 hour K-hole (4th Plateau). It can also be used as an EXPERIMENTAL DO NOT TRY WITHOUT THREE TRIP SITTERS AND A GUARD DOG sort of drug with the mythical 5th or Sigma Plateau.<br /><br />It can be used as an anti-depressant.<br /><br />In a pinch it can help you stop coughing. :P

				Oh I forgot a few things.<br /><br />It can help you take much larger hits.<br /><br />Yes the syrup is nasty, but throwing up is a magical experience on DXM. Also, anyone with basic chemistry knowledge can easily separate the syrup from the crystals.<br /><br />It&#039;s also incredibly interesting in the way it build tolerance. <br />Its not like you have to take more and more to get the same feeling (like, every plateau is shifted up 100mgs), it works by plateau. I had far far too many 2nd plateaus in my day, so now I simply can&#039;t have them. 1st still works at the same dosage as before, 3rd still works at the same dosage as before, but 2nd is just gone. As I understand it, that&#039;s permanent, which is a shame, but still hugely interesting from a psychopharmacological position.

				Would it be popular here? I considered getting it before (the powder) because it&#039;s ULTIMATELY cheap. I could sell it for a £10 a g.

Go to raves and sell it in 400mg quantities for however much your poundy equivalent of one hit of acid is.

				Well I can get a kilo for under a grand in sterling so I could literally do it at £10 a g and still make a wedge. That&#039;s why I think it could be cool because it&#039;s so cheap.

				Well it is a given that your biggest problem would be finding enough people interested. DXM is rather notorious for being love-it-or-hate-it (off the top of my head, I think the ratio was one would love it, one like it and one hate it), and it has a babbysfirstdrug stigma. Getting past that will be your biggest problem.<br /><br />But by all means, do try, I would love to see DXM become cool. Be the Owl Stanley of DXM :P

				Me and my friends had some of our most interesting trips while on DXM, and before we built a significant tolerance we&#039;d been in love with it. Google for William White&#039;s DXM FAQ if you want to learn how versatile and complex substance it is. Calling it pathetic just because it is legal or because psychoactive doses are larger than antitussive ones is just laughable.<br /><br />As for long-term side effects mentioned by kmfkewm - I only heard about visual noise in heavy/frequent users, but I will trade bladder problems caused by ketamine for visual noise any day.
