				stick to those guns oscar!<br /><br />he&#039;s posting here, so he HAS something to allow it, but he might be nowhere near it on the 30th, and if being on a computer today can allow someone to locate me 3 days later when I am away from said technology, then I gotta put my tin foil hat back on today (I just hope they havent planted a tracking chip in my hat since last time I wore it.

That is one of the things I&#039;m quite happy Dave and George did tbh, less man-power = more earning power.<br /><br />Going on to the whole TOR security thing Oscar is right, any human-created system IS fallible and we have to be prepared for the fact that there is the possibility that one day the Pork-Products and their chums in the Alphabet-Mafia could crack the golden onion. It&#039;s just highly unlikely they will do it any time soon and it&#039;s not that likely they will focus on that to fuck SR because of the expense and manpower it would take and there is a lot of easier methods they will try first, these being the weaknesses of BitCoin, the improper laundering of funds acquired via SR and then stuff like mail profiling for packages that get clocked.
