				So there are superlabs in Mexico that are cooking dirt-cheap crystal methamphetamine so why is it so scarce in europe ? Everyones paying top dollar here for it. Maybe there&#039;s some mexican vendors with ingenious shipping that sends drugs from mexico in mail successfully ? Also there cheap cocaine, and cheap and potent black tar. Please Anyone from mexico can you explain drug scene there ? ALSO I&#039;ve seen documentary where they show mexican doctors selling oxycodone 80 mg and 160 mg for like 20-30 $ each old formula, so&nbsp; thats insane I think. I mean how much for a kilo of pure crystal out there ? And how much for it when imported here in europe ? Maybe anyone knows some other goodies in Mexico ? I bet you can buy bunch of benzos and even barbs there. Everyones so crooked..

				You mentioned benzos, I went on vacation to Mexico about 7-10 years ago and I bought Valium right over the counter in a pharmacy. I&#039;m pretty sure it was legal, not just a corrupt pharmacist, but legal to buy benzos. This was in Cabo San Lucas and what a ball I had their. Besides the Marlin fishing,&nbsp; I cought a 10 footer,&nbsp; the partying was off the hook. I was there just a few days B4 Christmas, ya know, when nobody is vacationing, so there were really no other gringos there except for my friends and myself. The drug dealers and beautiful top of the line hookers were fighting over our business. <br />Memories&nbsp; &nbsp;;)
