				Title: <strong>SOPA</strong><br />

				For anyone who doesn&#039;t know the SOPA is<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), also known as H.R.3261, is a bill that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26, 2011, by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and a bipartisan group of 12 initial co-sponsors. The bill expands the ability of U.S. law enforcement and copyright holders to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods.[2] Now before the House Judiciary Committee, it builds on the similar PRO-IP Act of 2008 and the corresponding Senate bill, the Protect IP Act.[3]<br /><br />The bill would allow the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement. Depending on who requests the court orders, the actions could include barring online advertising networks and payment facilitators such as PayPal from doing business with the infringing website, barring search engines from linking to such sites, and requiring Internet service providers to block access to such sites. The bill would make unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content a felony. The bill also gives immunity to Internet services that voluntarily take action against websites dedicated to infringement, while making liable for damages any copyright holder who knowingly misrepresents that a website is dedicated to infringement.[4]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Can this bill actually slow down internet piracy?&nbsp; Will people move to Usenet where the content is on a bulletin board system?&nbsp; I am interested to hear your thoughts on this.

				There are already browser apps that completely circumvent the DNS non-reporting issues that will come of this.&nbsp; It&#039;s basically like a tor network but straight-to-IP on any server that the violent thugs force the DNS&#039;s to stop routing to.&nbsp; Seriously... SOPA?&nbsp; &quot;there&#039;s an app for that&quot;.<br /><br />google it.&nbsp; Was invented as a response to the PROSPECT of this bill.&nbsp; Free market 1, Statist asshole fucks - 0

				There&#039;s also the namecoin system that is its own unique DNS service that has .bit domains. I&#039;m not all that familiar with it but since it&#039;s a derivative of bitcoin I figure somebody here probably knows more about it than me.
