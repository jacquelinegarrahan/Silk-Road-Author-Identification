				so last weekend my sister died after a long battle with pot. makes me really mad to see people talking about weeds like they arent something lethal. she started off smoking them with her boyfriend and if i ever see that motherfucker again i would probably want to kill him but i probably wont see him again since he died but anyway she started by smoking then started the freebase bullshit and then she found out how to do the injections and she instantly changed into someone else and i couldnt believe she was even my sistr she didnt take a bath all she did was sit around didnt eat she did like 4 shots of weed in one night the night she died she went into a coma hit 109 degree temp and my mom had to tell the doctor to turn off the machines. <br /><br />think about weeds before you do them. seriously theres no such thing as safety when messing around with powerful drugs

				Obviously, OP is pointing out the relative safety of marijuana compared to more harmful drugs like heroin and methamphetamine by using proof by contradiction.&nbsp; Given that this is a forum where by its very nature almost everyone reading it is a drug user, it seems redundant and unnecessary, but that&#039;s fine.&nbsp; I do disagree, though, with people who call weed harmless or claim that it&#039;s beneficial for all people.&nbsp; Marijuana is less harmful than other commonly used drugs (alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine), but not harmless.&nbsp; Physically, smoking marijuana (as opposed to eating or vaporizing it) is bad for your respiratory system (although not as bad as cigarettes).&nbsp; Psychologically, it can make certain people (such as myself) lazy and unambitious (and I can tell by the grammar people use on these forums and the groupthink many demonstrate in the off topic forum I am not the only one affected by this).&nbsp; Obviously, marijuana is much less harmful to pretty much everybody than alcohol, but it&#039;s not &quot;harmless.&quot;
