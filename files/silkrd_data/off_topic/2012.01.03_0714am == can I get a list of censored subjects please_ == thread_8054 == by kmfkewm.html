				I see my post about the federal police being sub-human scumbags who deserve to die was censored, well before it got to play out to its intended potential. Is it possible for me to get a list of censored topics so that I can make sure not to say anything offensive please? I apparently mistakenly thought that this was a forum that supported free speech.

				You think wanting to end your own enslavement is trolling? Is it living under a bridge to want to lock people up for harming nobody? When islamic terrorists create biological and chemical hazards that kill thousands of people they are killed, what issue do you have with the same logic being applied to other terrorist organizations?

Uhm, okay. You are a drug user so the probability of you being a snitch is probably far higher than any given hacker, of course you could reference that article about 1/4th of hackers being a federal informant but if you do I will just post a link to the articles that discredit it and show how they used flawed methodologies to make that propaganda piece. Not trusting any security experts because they might be snitches is a great way for you to use shitty security and end up in prison though. Why is wanting my freedom and the death of those who wish to take it from me a strange thing to say?

				Well last I checked Silk Road admin self identifies as an Agorist, and has essentially called Silk Road an Agorist venture. Now I am not sure how much you know about Agorism, but Wikipedia says <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Agorism is a political philosophy founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III and developed with contributions by J. Neil Schulman that holds as its ultimate goal bringing about a society in which all &quot;relations between people are voluntary exchanges – a free market.&quot;[1] The term comes from the Greek word &quot;agora,&quot; referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient Greek city-states. Ideologically, it is a term representing a revolutionary type of free-market anarchism.[2] According to Konkin, Schulman integrated the idea of counter-economics, the advocacy of untaxed black market activity, into Konkin&#039;s libertarian philosophy.[3]<br /><br /><br />Agorism is revolutionary market anarchism. In ... market anarchist society, law and security will be provided by market institutions, not political institutions. Agorists recognize, therefore, that those institutions can not develop through political reform. Instead, they will come about as a result of market processes. As government is banditry, revolution culminates in the suppression of government by market providers of security and law. Market demand for such service providers is what will lead to their emergence. Development of that demand will come from economic growth in the sector of the economy that explicitly shuns state involvement (and therefore can not turn to the state in its role as monopoly provider of security and law). That sector of the economy is the counter-economy – black and grey markets.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I think my political ramblings are at least somewhat at home here. I know not all Agorists think the state should be violently overthrown, but the sentiment does seem to be at least fairly common in such circles, with the main argument against it being closer to &#039;it isn&#039;t an effective method&#039; rather than &#039;it is morally wrong to overthrow slave owners and gain freedom&#039;. I know such systems as Jim Bells assassination politics are from people with strong agorist views, and Assassination Politics is a system that would be similar to SR but for the anonymous funding of assassination of political figures:<br /><br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Assassination_politics<br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jim_Bell<br /><br />but that aside, I stand by my viewpoint that federal and other agents who enforce drug laws are terrorists. They may not be VNSA&#039;s (violent non-state actors), the term that military and intelligence people use to describe what lay people consider to be terrorists (in reality terrorism is a propaganda term with no agreed upon definition, in fact one mans terrorist is anothers freedom fighter). However, they certainly are violent state actors, but since I do not recognize the authority of the state I see no difference between them and what is traditionally considered to be terrorists. <br /><br />There is little argument against the fact that the war on drugs has led to thousands of people becoming infected with HIV and other diseases, largely due to needle exchanges being illegal. This is force being used on the part of these assholes that directly results in biological hazards, if islamic terrorists infected thousands of people with HIV we would consider it a devestating attack. Additionally, the DEA has enforced laws that have caused many many thousands of people to overdose from impure and misadvertised substances, this would not happen in a market that could self regulate against such things, so in fact the DEA is responsible for the chemically induced deaths of thousands of innocent people.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8054.msg75092#msg75092">Quote from: kmfkewm on January 05, 2012, 11:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Well last I checked Silk Road admin self identifies as an Agorist, and has essentially called Silk Road an Agorist venture. Now I am not sure how much you know about Agorism, but Wikipedia says <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Agorism is a political philosophy founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III and developed with contributions by J. Neil Schulman that holds as its ultimate goal bringing about a society in which all &quot;relations between people are voluntary exchanges – a free market.&quot;[1] The term comes from the Greek word &quot;agora,&quot; referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient Greek city-states. Ideologically, it is a term representing a revolutionary type of free-market anarchism.[2] According to Konkin, Schulman integrated the idea of counter-economics, the advocacy of untaxed black market activity, into Konkin&#039;s libertarian philosophy.[3]<br /><br /><br />Agorism is revolutionary market anarchism. In ... market anarchist society, law and security will be provided by market institutions, not political institutions. Agorists recognize, therefore, that those institutions can not develop through political reform. Instead, they will come about as a result of market processes. As government is banditry, revolution culminates in the suppression of government by market providers of security and law. Market demand for such service providers is what will lead to their emergence. Development of that demand will come from economic growth in the sector of the economy that explicitly shuns state involvement (and therefore can not turn to the state in its role as monopoly provider of security and law). That sector of the economy is the counter-economy – black and grey markets.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So I think my political ramblings are at least somewhat at home here. I know not all Agorists think the state should be violently overthrown, but the sentiment does seem to be at least fairly common in such circles, with the main argument against it being closer to &#039;it isn&#039;t an effective method&#039; rather than &#039;it is morally wrong to overthrow slave owners and gain freedom&#039;. I know such systems as Jim Bells assassination politics are from people with strong agorist views, and Assassination Politics is a system that would be similar to SR but for the anonymous funding of assassination of political figures:<br /><br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Assassination_politics<br />https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jim_Bell<br /><br />but that aside, I stand by my viewpoint that federal and other agents who enforce drug laws are terrorists. They may not be VNSA&#039;s (violent non-state actors), the term that military and intelligence people use to describe what lay people consider to be terrorists (in reality terrorism is a propaganda term with no agreed upon definition, in fact one mans terrorist is anothers freedom fighter). However, they certainly are violent state actors, but since I do not recognize the authority of the state I see no difference between them and what is traditionally considered to be terrorists. <br /><br />There is little argument against the fact that the war on drugs has led to thousands of people becoming infected with HIV and other diseases, largely due to needle exchanges being illegal. This is force being used on the part of these assholes that directly results in biological hazards, if islamic terrorists infected thousands of people with HIV we would consider it a devestating attack. Additionally, the DEA has enforced laws that have caused many many thousands of people to overdose from impure and misadvertised substances, this would not happen in a market that could self regulate against such things, so in fact the DEA is responsible for the chemically induced deaths of thousands of innocent people. If islamic terrorists used violent force that resulted in thousands of people being killed by chemical agents we would consider it to be a horrible terrorist attack and scream for them to be brought to justice.<br /><br />Additionally the DEA steals billions of dollars from people in seized money and other property, they are a mafia, terrorists, extortion agents. They lock up millions of people for victimless crimes, ruining countless lives, ripping apart communites, spreading disease and death everywhere they go. They are a clear and present danger to freedom and to liberty and to happiness and to the very well being of the United States and the entire fucking world. They spread lies and disinformation via propaganda and keep people stupid, they are enemies to science to logic and to honesty itself.<br /><br />The DEA exists to lock up innocent people. They do this so that they can continue to divert billions of dollars of tax money to themselves, tax money that is stolen at gun point by equally evil IRS agents. They do this so they can fill prison beds and keep money flowing to the private prison industry and state and federal prisons can keep increasing their budgets.

Is it because you have no ability to intelligently argue what-so-ever? Are my statements so inherently wrong that you can&#039;t be bothered to waste your time to argue against them (this is my favorite excuse from stupid people who &#039;feel&#039; that I am wrong but have zero intelligent arguement against what I say). One admin somehow mistakenly saw my post as trolling when in reality it is my real view, and the owner of the entire SR is also an Agorist so I imagine he has somewhat similar views to mine.<br /><br />Your mind has been poisoned by the state into such a state that you think they have any legitimacy. Which of my comments was so stupid, calling the DEA terrorists? Well, what is a terrorist? Is it someone who kills innocent people for political objectives? Well, that would include the DEA, they kill innocents all the time. The DEA and other agents of drug enforcement are directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths and enslavement of millions of people, and these deaths are caused by biological and chemical agents in many cases. In objective reality the DEA is engaging in a form of irregular warfare against large percentages of US citizens, they are utilizing novel payload delivery mechanisms to maliciously spread deadly chemical and biological materials. They are doing this purely for reasons of money, politics and religion. The victims of their vicious attacks are in many cases innocent of any objective crime.&nbsp; Only your obscured view of a reality seen through the propaganda lenses government has sewn onto your eyes makes it seem like anything else is the case. <br /><br />I really hate statists. I especially hate statists who are so fucking stupid that even though they themselves are criminals in the eyes of the government, people to be hunted down and imprisoned for causing no harm to others, simply to justify the violent redistribution of wealth and power from the people to the prison industrial industry and the elite class, and yet they still worship the state. I don&#039;t understand how you can have any degree of respect for the state or any of its agents, around the entire world they have caused enormous amounts of pain and suffering and yet people are still addicted to the concept. There is absolutely no requirement for government, and government is inherently banditry and those who violently enforce the supremacy of government over the inherent rights of the individual are in every sense equal to terrorists. <br /><br />Since your youngest years you have been indoctrinated into thinking that government is as required for and inherent to humanity as the air you breathe, you have had so many pro-government cognitive traps conditioned into your mind by the mass media, religious, education etc systems (not to mention simple culture conditioning, which spreads from generation to generation like a genetic virus) that as soon as you even hear the idea of government (especially your special government) being anything other than the holy saviors of the people (who they are imprisoning, killing, sending to die and stealing from) your mind literally shuts itself down and triggers the conditioned responses. It is truly a fucking pathetic sight to see humans who have been reduced to salvating dogs, but I don&#039;t particularly hold it against you, and I hope that one day you can also open your eyes to the human cancer that is government and try to help other enlightened beings struggle against them. After all, that is more or less the Agorist manifesto, and last I checked SR was an Agorist community.
