				Yeah I was pretty shocked with the comments on the articles reporting this story...I mean 95% of the comments from people are calling for the death of all drug users, drug dealers, and anyone involved with drugs. I mean really?? I would rather have harsher penalties for child molesters and rapists instead of anyone involved with drugs. <br /><br />By now almost everyone should know the penalties involved in places like Indonesia or Thailand not to mention they have warnings plastered all over the airports and other places reminding you that the penalty can be death so this guy knew damn well what he was getting himself into....but that doesn&#039;t mean I agree with the death penalty or life imprisonment for drug traffickers.

				worst part about it is that a intricate and well built drug network cannot exist anywhere without police complacency/corruption. they are just trying to throw the rabid crowd a bone to keep them off the scent of the bigger picture. it is like that great scene in new jack city &quot;ain&#039;t no uzis made in harlem. not one of us in here owns a poppy field. this shit is a lot bigger then nino brown. this is big business. this is the American way&quot;. you can change the word American for any state and it is equally applicable.

				Ignorance through morality is thoroughly sickening. To have this level of hatred for something that they could not possibly understand is heartbreaking. I&#039;m still of the belief that their common morality has lead to the shear destructive pattern that ruins the lives and families of users. While certainly harder drugs have nasty side effects for abuses of said drugs, but are further extended by the natural lengths that businesses and people go when pressured through prohibition. Now we have Levimasole in our cocaine shredding our immune systems, Desomorphine (krokodil) consuming our flesh, and countless other shite consuming us whole. All for their sake, their need to feel superior to the so called scum of the earth. Ugh, sometimes I need to avoid reading the comments section of online newspapers, they make me angrily depressed, heh.

				Sometimes I laugh at how &quot;dissidents&quot; or &quot;human rights advocates&quot; are separated from ourselves on the darknet by people who use such terms. It is such a semantic distinction.<br /><br />We ARE dissidents. We&#039;re just Western dissidents. It isn&#039;t just people stuck behind the Great Firewall of China that are experiencing persecution for making entirely self determined voluntary choices. This article is a classic example of such a thing.<br /><br />We are not criminals. The DEA and their cohort are criminals. I don&#039;t agree with some people&#039;s proposals on what to do with them en masse, but that they are a criminal organization is self evident.<br /><br />We are talking about an organization that actually has LE agents carry &#039;drop guns&#039; to avoid blowback, so whoever gets shot was always the &quot;bad guy&quot; and it is forever and always a case of &quot;self defense&quot;. Such unscrupulous practices didn&#039;t work out down in Arizona (or maybe it did come to think of it, read the articles) for a bunch of LE last time they shot a former marine back from Iraq. They basically tore the door down and blew the head off a guy just back from a tour of duty in Iraq and then his infant child then wandered out of a closet bewildered while his father&#039;s blood pooled on the floor. They weren&#039;t even close to being sorry once they realized their mistake, they then interrogated his terrified widow and tried to intimidate her into incriminating her husband. It&#039;s actually even worse than I&#039;m making it sound, hardly believable I know, read here:<br /><br />http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/05/18/iraq-war-veteran-jose-guerena-killed-by-arizona-swat-team/<br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/17/jose-guerena-pima-county-lawsuit_n_926454.html<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP0f00_JMak&amp;feature=player_embedded<br /><br />A fair number of the agents we face have all the morality of lizards and none of the intellect. Not all LE agents are evil. But some of them are. And many more are guilty by association with such a corrupt and perverse organization.<br />

You cannot define people as evil by placing them into a category, they have to be judged as individuals. Many LE agents are corrupt, not all. Some product distributors have no qualms with coercion, others do. You have to sort the wheat from the chaff or you yourself would be committing a crime.

				I hate this kind of news. I hate it that people&#039;s lives get ruined like this. I hate it that families get torn apart because somebody -probably from a shitty financial situation- made a stupid decision. This whole prohibition is just not worth it. I can only imagine how horrible it must be to have a loved one on death row in a foreign country.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I like projects like Silk Road.
