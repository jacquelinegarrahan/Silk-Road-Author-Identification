				Investigators say three men were so desperate to get high that they ended up lighting up outside a New Jersey State Police Station.<br /><br />On Tuesday, state trooper Erik Tapia pulled into the parking lot of the Totowa Barracks in Totowa, Passaic County. Tapia was getting ready to go out on patrol but officials say it didnâ€™t take long for him to see some action. Tapia smelled marijuana smoke coming from another car in the lot. He went to investigate and found three men with small bags of marijuana in plain sight sitting inside a 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue, according to investigators.<br /><br />Police say the three men decided to light up while waiting for their friend who was at the station attempting to pick up paperwork for an impounded car.<br /><br />Tamer Abdelrahim, 22, of West Paterson, Isaias Parrilla, 22, of Paterson, Hensly Nunez, 21, of Paterson, and Bernardo Cuevas, 23, of Paterson were all arrested.<br /><br />Police say they found 15 small plastic bags of marijuana and more than a dozen ecstasy pills when they searched the dar.<br /><br />All four men were charged with possession of drugs.<br /><br />Cuevas was turned over to Paterson Police for an outstanding warrant while Parrilla was turned over to Totowa Police for an outstanding warrant.<br /><br />The other two men were released pending court appearances.
