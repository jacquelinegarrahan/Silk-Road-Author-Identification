				I DIDN&#039;T GET TOMORROWLAND TICKETS!&nbsp; :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[&nbsp; &nbsp;I literally have been waiting MONTHS to buy tickets. <br /><br />5 computers and 2 hours later, absolutely nothing. Now, people are selling them on ebay and other ticketing sites for thousands of dollars. WTF?! I&#039;m not saying not to resell (I&#039;ve done it many a time) but really... $2000 for a ticket that cost $200?!&nbsp; THE FUCK......<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m the idiot for buying airfare and hotel already (wanted a cheaper price). Anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? I need help here. I really want to go. <br /><br />AND PLEASE, DO NOT SAY TO WAIT FOR TOMMOROWORLD. That makes me even more angry. Atlanta? REALLY??!???<br /><br />Thanks for the vent. =)

				i don&#039;t know what tomorrowland is but if it&#039;s anything like reading fest you can just rock up and get a ticket off a tout for face value or a little over/under depending on how late you are and how many they have to move. also for big festivals sometimes they release the tickets in batches so in a few months see if any more go on sale. some might pop back up because of credit card failure etc. keep an eye on ebay last minute. sometimes genuine fans will sell for face value and fees if they find out they can&#039;t go. try blag a press pass, enter competitions..

				Depending on the airline you might be able to change your ticket. If so, fly into Nevada for Labor day instead. I hear there&#039;s a pretty cool party there.

The after-parties and the whole week were so much fun. Unfortunately, this year none of my friends were able to afford both Ultra AND EDC so we chose EDC because we live on the West side so it&#039;s much cheaper to get to Vegas than Miami with the flight. Oh I loved it down there though... Really hoping to go back next year. Those after-parties sell out super quick, soo hopefully you&#039;re able to hop on that soon!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />1 step ahead! Got my shit lined up. Pretty lights, Big Gigantic, and a strip club should do the trick.

				Businessmentality, you would ACTUALLY be my hero. If you do want to sell, definitely send me a message (I&#039;ve already figured out how we could do it pretty anonymously and safe for both parties). That is really nice of you- but I would totally pay you a little extra. ;)<br /><br />And if you do end up going, hope to see you there!!!!<br />
