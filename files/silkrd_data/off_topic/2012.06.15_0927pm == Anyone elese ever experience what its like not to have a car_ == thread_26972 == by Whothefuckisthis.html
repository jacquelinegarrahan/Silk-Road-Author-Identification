				Story of my life up until a few days ago. I always took the bus everywhere, rode my bike or walked. Now I feel like a lazy fuck with my vehicle taking trips to the store at 2AM for Dortios.

				I rode my bike for two years to the local library to work in my time off during high school to buy my first car. So I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve really experienced not having a vehicle considering I&#039;ve had one since before I got my driver&#039;s license. My truck&#039;s like my phone, I wouldn&#039;t know what to do without it. So that sucks for you broseph. :-\

				I don&#039;t have a car at the moment and it&#039;s like I lost a limb! It&#039;s too expensive to be a car owner where i&#039;m from. Between fuel and insurance, it is a rip off.<br /><br />My first years insurance cost me more than my car!!!

				Yeah i got a jeep Cherokee from my grandmother and not even five months later had to give it to my parents since my mom wrecked her car. So i never really got the hang of driving stick. Its really inhibited my love life in terms of holding down a girlfriend aside from getting lucky, which is fucking annoying.

				My car has been fucked up since 09 and now the plates are severely overdue-but I&#039;m in a fraternity and I either use the bus (get a free pass from my school) or borrow one of my brother&#039;s vehicles if I really need to go somewhere-say...bank of america to fund my mt.gox account!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />It does suck.&nbsp; My friends are all swimming right now and having fun and I could join them but I don&#039;t have a ride there, and its an area not serviced by public transportation :(<br /><br />Least I have the SR forums to keep me company, ahhhahaha

				Ive never had a car - I really enjoy walking while listening to music<br />When i was 18 the local pub was a five mile walk ( double on the way back ) and some of the best laughs of my life wer with my mates on those walks.<br />Been walking for the rest of my life,.<br />On the downside my feet are so mangled they look like they belong to a gargoyle.<br />On the plus side I can hang upside down from rafters.

				Yeah the whole situation worked out to be a one time thing which is fine with me. ^_^&nbsp; Still though, it would be nice to have some sort of steady relationship and a life without worrying about how to get from point a to b. Only thing to do is keep working, keep saving.

				I went 4 months without a car. It taught me how to use busses, bikes, friends, and cabs to get around. Now I have a car and only use it for road trips and emergencies. To be honest, I get pretty irritated when I have to drive anywhere these days. Plus, cars make people fat!
