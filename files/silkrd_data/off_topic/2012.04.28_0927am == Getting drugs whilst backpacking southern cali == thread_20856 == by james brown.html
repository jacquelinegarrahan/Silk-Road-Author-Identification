				I have been racking my brain about this for days now.<br /><br />In August im back packing from l.a - vegas - san fran. I plan on heading to outsidelands festival in san fran on the 10th and need to sort some good gear, I was hoping to get some off here. I know face to face is not an option so does anyone have any ideas? <br /><br />I think this is stupid but what a about having mail sent to my hotel or hostel????? Or maybe someone could do some sort of blind drop where they leave it somewhere and then msg. I dont know.... Also will need stuff in vegas.

				I live in socal, blind drop for a decent quantity would definitely be an option.<br /><br />Also, just get your medical card so you can get weed anywhere in Cali without having to worry :)

				I am sure you by just hanging out with some locals drugs will be seen or talked about, because they are very prevalen in SoCal. I was at a party and a guy was just doing coke in the kitchen with his buddy, and nobody even batted and eye. The crowd was all young affluent and seemed preppy or the in group college kids. Where I am from coke isn&#039;t accepted that widly and you would offend someone doing it in the open at a house party with that kind of group.<br /><br />Weed was of course smoked everywhere and in the middle of the apartment complex. Even the owner or manager of the complex chatted with us which was a group of 6-8 young adults smoking weed and drinking beer telling us to just be careful and try not to stink up the place.
