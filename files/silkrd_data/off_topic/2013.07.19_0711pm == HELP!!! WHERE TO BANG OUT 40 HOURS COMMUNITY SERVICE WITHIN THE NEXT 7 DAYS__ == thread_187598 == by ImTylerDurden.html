				sup brahs,<br />Im out of USA.<br />moving out of state next friday, therefore I need to bang all this community service out by then. I need 40 hours in. I have called so many places. Salvation army is the only place that will take me so far, and I really dont want to sort dirty clothing for 40 hours. Ive already called red cross, animal shelters, boys and girls club and there are no food banks near me. <br /><br />if you dont have any advice, pls send halp. ty men.

				A Global Links establishment (sorting medical supplies)<br />Maybe call some churches in your area? They always know where community serice is<br />Your local Police Station or that of a large city nearby<br />Call schools nearby<br /><br />They might not offer community service but will know where to find some

				mate it&#039;s only 40 hours, just do the salvation army shit and get it over with. it probably won&#039;t be anywhere near as bad as you think. i&#039;d rather do that than scrub graffiti or pick up litter for 40 hours. plus you could waste a crap load more hours looking for something better before you figure out that you&#039;re not supposed to enjoy community service.

You know that essentially counts as extra hours of doing shit you don&#039;t want to do, except that it doesn&#039;t count against the hours you owe. Its like you&#039;re creating more misery for yourself.

				If you like animals, why not a shelter or humane society? It wouldn&#039;t be all cleaning up either, you can do some of that and walk dogs and stuff.
