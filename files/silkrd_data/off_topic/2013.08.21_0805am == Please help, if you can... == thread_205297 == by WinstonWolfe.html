				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s creepy or tacky at all. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Any of YOU ever been homeless? Probably not. With kids it&#039;s got to be even more nerve wracking so cut him slack and show some courtesy. I&#039;ve been on the streets a few different times and it wasn&#039;t some fucked up choice I made to get me there either. Shit happens. Begging for change is one of the most demeaning things but what do you do when you&#039;re hungry and day labor didn&#039;t have enough work that day? <br /><br />$7000 is a lot to come up with but I bet you could sell off non-essentials and that could help. Get another legit job or find a way to boost your sales. You&#039;ve got a little less that 30 days. If it comes down to the wire try to do a short sale on your home. You&#039;ll lose a lot of money but at least there won&#039;t be a foreclosure on your record. You can then take the short sale cash and just buy a smaller home in a different neighborhood. You don&#039;t want that foreclosure. Honestly, short sale sounds like it may be your best bet considering there is less that 30 days left. Right? Good luck.

				Well I find this may just be a scam.<br />I mean, how many homes are foreclosed and have that exact date on it? Probably not more than a thousand or couple thousand. Which means you would have narrowed your identity to a small number of people.<br />I don&#039;t think you would do this. Why would you? That&#039;s why I&#039;m calling scam. Sorry, because t may not be, but I&#039;m far too careful on here.<br /><br />Well hope it all gets worked out for you.<br />Sell more drugs! That will help&nbsp; :)

				Major props to you for having the stones to ask. I lost my house after my cycle accident, as I didn&#039;t have health insurance, and the guy who splatted me was without a license or insurance. My hosp bills &lt;$100,000, so the bank took my house as collateral on the bill, and I still ended up declaring bankruptcy.<br /><br />I salute your fortitude, and willingness to do what it takes to keep your family safe. I wish you well, and there is just something about you that I like. <br /><br />May you always find shade, may the wind be at your back, and may your path rise up to meet your feet.

				Happy to hear how your situation resolved!&nbsp; What an amazing show of generosity by abcabcabccba, it&#039;s warming to the heart to know there are perfect strangers out there in the world who are willing to put their trust in people and pay it forward to help others, especially such a large amount!

				YAY! Hadn&#039;t visited this thread to see how thing were going but I am glad they went well for you. Hopefully you were able to get a good perspective on how to hopefully not be put in that situation again. How awesome of the SR community to help someone that much. =) <br /><br />When you think of it it&#039;s just beautiful really. WinstonWolfe I sure hope that if one day you have the money again and SR is still around you&#039;ll pay these guys back. Either way. Peace

				Hi WinstonWolfe.<br /><br />Glad you got out of your bind.<br /><br />Can I just ask - before you got out of your bind, would selling your house have solved the problem?<br /><br />I&#039;m just curious, as although this read as a &quot;please save my family&quot; kind of post, I&#039;m not sure that it really was that dire?<br /><br />It sounded to me like - &#039;please help me save my valuable asset&#039;.
