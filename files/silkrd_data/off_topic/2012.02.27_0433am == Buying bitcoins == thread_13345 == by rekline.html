				Hey everyone, hope this is the correct forum.&nbsp; If not, my apologies.<br /><br />Im new to bitcoins.&nbsp; Can anyone suggest a service or website that sells bitcoins and makes them available to you instantly or at least the same day, without having to use a service like westernunion that charges such high fees?&nbsp; I&#039;m open to any method of payment including bank transfer, as long as the fees aren&#039;t too high (westernunion fees are around $20 - Id prefer less).<br /><br />Thanks! :)

				For my first and so far only bitcoin transaction I used get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />First, fill out the buy form. <br /><br />Leave &quot;maximum price&quot; blank if you want your transaction guaranteed.&nbsp; &quot;Maximum price&quot; is the maximum price your willing to pay per bitcoin.&nbsp; If the cost of bitcoins is higher than your chosen &#039;maximum price&#039; at the time your bitcoin buy is processed, your transaction will be cancelled and your money refunded.&nbsp; Since bitcoin prices fluctuate and get-bitcoins doesn&#039;t provide instant service (transactions take at least a day depending on how fast you provide payment) its best to leave these option blank.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in no rush and/or are unwilling to possibly pay slightly more per bitcoin, choose a maximum price your willing to pay per coin and insert that number here.<br /><br />In order to get your &quot;bitcoin address&quot; login to SR and click &quot;account&quot;.&nbsp; On your account page copy the number that follows &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:&quot; and paste it where it says &quot;bitcoin address&quot; on the get-bitcoins buy form.&nbsp; This way, your bitcoins will be sent directly to your silkroad bitcoin wallet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Choose whichever payment method you prefer including western union (note, western union charges around $20 in fees, plus get-bitcoins charges a 5% commission).&nbsp; <br /><br />After submitting the order, closely follow the payment instructions given to you by get-bitcoins.&nbsp; These instructions will be based on your method of payment.<br /><br />Please note:&nbsp; Fees will be subtracted automatically from your bitcoin buy (get-bitcoins has a 5% commission I believe).&nbsp; Do some math ahead of time and plan accordingly.&nbsp; In order to cover commission fees and still have enough for your purchase, spend a few extra bucks on bitcoins .&nbsp; Also, in order to calculate how much cash you must spend in order to get the correct corresponding amount of bitcoins (depending on how much your silkroad purchase costs), use a bitcoin calculator prior to buying bitcoins <br /><br />This is the easiest method Ive found but Id love to see some other suggestions, especially those that are instant. Im still new to the process. <br /><br />Hope this helps!!! :)

				Dont freaking mess with moneypaks unless you want to be stuck with it for a week or get ripped off<br /><br />get-btc is a decent option, but in addition to the fees sometimes they completely abuse the exchange rate and just give you coins for the highest rate reached that day which is bull shit<br /><br />i would recommend using cash deposits at a bank with bitinstant to fund mt. gox <br /><br />they send you an email and you redeem the code instantly on mt gox, after which you can immediately buy bitcoins<br /><br />so fast, so easy but you are still going to pay 5 % for the fee. Methods that take a few days like dwolla generally run around 1%

				personally I wouldnt<br /><br />I would at least try to send it through one wallet that your ip isnt associated with, although if the tumbler on SR actually functions as its supposed to they wont be able to see what the coins bought, just that they went to SR

				But how about buying bitcoints form people who do this on this site in the money section? would you say just avoid them? i don&#039;t have if i have to have a 5%-10% discount. It seems easier and faster.<br />I&#039;m really starting to get very confused about which way to go about it. and i only have like 5 days till i try and get and use bitcoins.

				Cool, Thanks. Things are starting to make sense. it&#039;s not that complicated, i guess because there are a lot of options, it makes you confused on how to actually go about it. I&#039;m glad i didn&#039;t rush anything and stuck around and kept reading and reading. The path seems clearer now.
