				Say one was to be found with MXE in the US in a state with no specific laws against MXE, what would happen?&nbsp; I believe that the analogue act does not cover it because it is an analogue of ketamine which is schedule.&nbsp; I thought that I read somewhere that it would become some sort of problem with the FDA but I really don&#039;t know.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

				It has to be formally banned, the analog act only has the drugs in a grey area, why do you care about if its illegal or not? if it gets found, you&#039;re not getting it..

Instead what they do is treat it as a analogue of PCE which is just right to invoke an send your ass to FED. <br /><br />As for the FDA? Fuck them 1 million times over to the power of 666. Those guys are just as bad as our government. Matter of fact the FDA are the last people you should ever worry about, DHS is the one making busts these days which cracks me up wtf they have to do with drugs in the 1st place.

				Fast dig leads to this<br /><br />http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/microgram-journals/2012/mj9-1_3-17.pdf&nbsp; (DEA SITE)<br /><br />The important text is <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Methoxetamine or 2-(3-Methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)- cyclohexanone (Figure 1), commonly referred to as &quot;MXE&quot; or &quot;3-MeO-2-Oxo-PCE,&quot; is a new compound for sale over the Internet. Methoxetamine was originally publicized through an interview with an &quot;underground chemist&quot; who envisioned its dissociative properties and proposed that it would be &quot;a stress-free version of ketamine&quot; [1]. Although not currently scheduled under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, methoxetamine may be considered to be an analog of ketamine (Figure 2) [2]; replacing the ortho chlorine ketamine with a meta methoxy, and replacing the N-methyl with an N-ethyl. Herein, we report the structural elucidation of methoxetamine through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and subsequent independent synthesis. The analytical data are also compared to the structurally similar drug ketamine. Additionally, analytical profiles of methoxetamineâ€™s synthetic intermediates and its major synthetic impurity are presented to assist forensic chemists who may encounter these substances in casework.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So they will treat it as a analogue of ket on paper but the reason I said PCE is due to this case<br /><br /><br />http://www.scribd.com/doc/118168734/North-Dakota-Indictment<br />its page 2, 3rd chemical down. <br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t know if that DEA paper is outdated or what but anyways your welcome&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />By the way it took me a good hour to find that fucking court document, <br />

				Even if it&#039;s a non-illegal RC if you have it split up for individual consumption they will bust you. Only in bulk form is it safe if it&#039;s not yet scheduled.<br /><br />Modzi

If the amount is minute then you can plead down to possession n maybe what community service+probation if your record is squeaky clean?

				you are correct it tests for pcp on a reagent test, and in drug screenings.

You will have to deal with the idea of possibly staying locked up while they lab test it and then once its proven not to be pcp but mxe this is where it gets tricky. They might let you go n call it a day or they might charge you with the analogue law, it all depends on how much of a dick head the DA wants to be.

				I only read the first post but I want to point out that the federal analogue act of 1986 also covers any substances that imitate or mimic the effects of schedule 1 and 2 substances and I have read that MXE falls under the federal analogue act because of PCP.&nbsp; I am not saying that I agree with that but that is what I have read.&nbsp; It is illegal to sell for human consumption.&nbsp; If you were caught in possession of a small amount of MXE in a state where it is not specifically illegal then you would be fine.

Its silly, its stupid but when has the drug war or LEO ever been rational? I also think some states have asset forfeiture laws and you might lose your car, once again totally fucking stupid.
