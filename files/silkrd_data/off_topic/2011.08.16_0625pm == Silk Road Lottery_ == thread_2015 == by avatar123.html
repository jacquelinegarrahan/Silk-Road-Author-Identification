				What about a lottery here in silk road? Since there is a ponzi scheme already in place, a lottery would be better for all.

				I&#039;ve seen a couple of vendors offer a lottery for their product. Who knows if it was legit. If the winner isn&#039;t known to the community, well, lets just say it would be a easy way to scam. Maybe if someone trusted ran it. No, im not nominating myself, but if someone trusted it ran it, I think it would be quite successful.

				I tries posting an Acid raffle a while back, but after a few days, I only had one person interested. Maybe I did it wrong by trying with 25 hits.... I would do it again with a ten strip if there is interest. the way it worked last time was.... I have physical raffle tickets. I package X number of them in envelopes to ship to customers. each ticket has a verification code on the back. once the numbers were sealed, I drew the winning number, and created a unique pgp key set for the raffle. i encrypted the winning number, and posted it in the listing. the idea was that I would send a physical ticket to the customer and a pm with the private key to decode the winning number. the customer decodes the winning number from the listing, and if they have the matching ticket, they PM me the verification code from the back of the ticket, along with shipping details, and I send out the prize.<br /><br /><br />there didn&#039;t seem to be much interest, but if there is now, I will do it again. maybe next time I will do it the same way, but instead of the pgp stuff, I will just post a picture in the listing with the winning number, and whoever gets that ticket just sends the verification code, or could post said code in the forums to keep everything as open as possible.<br /><br />I have a ten strip left from my last batch, and will do this if there is interest<br /><br />sell the raffle tickets for à¸¿1 each, and sell 11 of them for the tenstrip. (so I can make a bit of money also)
