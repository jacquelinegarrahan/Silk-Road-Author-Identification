				nope, never heard of it. not really a gamer anymore. i was a COD guy until i was eventually able to pretty much cut it out of my life (i got very angry at the game and spent a lot of time on it...i didn&#039;t like what it did to me.) soon after that, I got my Xbox stolen so that was when I officially stopped. i do like rolling though so we have that in common at least.

				Never heard of it either. I heard of Street Fighter, and Future Wars, but not streetwars. Was it a computer game? I never played too much Street Fighter, the combos were too difficult. So what did I do? Played MK which was even harder. ::) Live and learn. <br /><br />Anyway why did you bring that up lol? ::)<br /><br />And what happened to your 250 or so posts? <br /><br />And finally, what is happening to people deleting their accounts or having their accounts deleted this week? I noticed. It&#039;s kind of weird.<br /><br />Anyway, I only played COD: Black Ops and it was the worst game I&#039;ve ever played in terms of graphics and gameplay and buttons expressly created to piss people off. Admittedly I only played 30 minutes but that was enough. I told my friend to I didn&#039;t want to borrow it, so get it out of my PlayBox already. So annoying. Fuck. What does it take to kre-8 a proper game these days? They clearly need my F1. I would be awesome. Totally awesome. Well compared to the lack of talent around these days in development I would be. <br /><br />Anyway what are we actually talking about here anyway, what is futurestreets and why do you like it?<br /><br />You awake...?<br /><br />Your sincelrely, :&#039;( :&#039;(<br /><br />;]Raz<br /><br />STIZZZZZONED&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />(gonna regret posting this in the morning)
