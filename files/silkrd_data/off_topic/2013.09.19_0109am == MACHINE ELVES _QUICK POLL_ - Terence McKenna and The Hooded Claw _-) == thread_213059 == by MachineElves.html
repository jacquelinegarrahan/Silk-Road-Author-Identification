				<br />Question! - Do you think that Terence McKenna sounds anything like the &quot;Hooded Claw&quot; from the cartoon, Perils of Penelope Pitstop??&nbsp; ;D ;D<br /><br />We were watching some of the old cartoon episodes with one of our young Elves and could not stop noticing that he sounded just like him.<br /><br />Perhaps Paul Lynde got his inspiration for his Hanna-Barbera character&#039;s voice, from listening to the great man himself! - Who knows ;-)<br /><br />Example You Tube Link where you can listen to the &quot;Hooded Claw&quot;&nbsp; :D : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F22nL30JHiU<br /><br />Makes it even more fun to listen to Terence&#039;s speech&#039;s, whilst momentarily imagining him being his &quot;alter ego&quot; - Hahahaha&nbsp; ;D ;D<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES.

				Just to be sure we were not going over the top with our reply to John,<br /><br />We like to be more than fair with all Buyers and Vendors.<br /><br />However, here are some of JohnTheBaptist&#039;s measured and POLITE posts:&nbsp; :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[ :-[<br /><br />I would say he is AT LEAST RACIST and extremely IMMATURE - I&nbsp; would (and have advised others) not to sell to this idiot.<br /><br />He is a prepubescent forum basher at BEST. <br /><br />RANDOM QUOTES BELOW ( link to his Show Posts page: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=78911;area=showposts;start=0 )<br /><br />JohnTheBaptist Quotes from Various Posts:<br /><br />&lt;JohnTheBaptist on Politeness!&gt;<br /><br />- &quot;Apologize? who the fuck do you think you are. You fuck up someones discussion, it clearly states use a polite tone. Then you demand your reinstated, Why don&#039;t you go and stick your head up your ass and see if it fits, ungrateful cheeky cunt.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;JohnTheBaptist on 911 Conspiracy&gt;<br /><br />- &quot;The small fact what always is &quot;overlooked&quot;&nbsp; is that&nbsp; the insurance that was taken out 12 months before on a building that was supposedly infallible. Then you have the 3rd tower which the sheeple don&#039;t talk about, yes the small tower wedged in between the twins, that miraculously fell without nothing touching it. Then there&#039;s the fact that 3 weeks before the staged crashes, the building was subject to never before security checks. The skeptics think this is when the explosives where planted. Now somebody made a hell ov a bet on September 10th. They bet that the stocks would plummet, and lo and behold they did. These mysterious forecasts were not picked up on. And the winnings where not collected. Now you also have the pentagon. 6 CCTV cameras all captured&nbsp; the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the pentagon, only the whole wasn&#039;t big enough, you then had man in black type people picking up bits of the wreckage, since when do CIA operatives salvage scrap. The correct procedure would of been an investigation. Any way these facts coupled together all point to foul play. Oh the sudden death of a guy that was exposing these inaccuracies.&quot;<br /><br />&lt;Inresponse to someone asking where Gonzo has gone&gt;<br /><br />- &quot;Wave goodbye to that.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;I&#039;m surprised she can say anything, with a mouth full of black cock.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;What do you call a Paki that doesn&#039;t smell??? Asif ha ha ha&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Ha ha....how do you save a nigger from drowning??? Take your foot of the bastards head.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Mustafagander....what do you call a Paki lesbian?? Minge-eater...ha you get it mingeeater.....Whats the fastest thing on 2 legs??? an Eathiopian with a dinner ticket. he he&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;What do you call a nigger with a machine gun??? Sir ha ha<br />Please send your racist jokes.&quot; <br /><br />- &quot;Just read the fucking wiki like everyone else has to. What makes you different?&quot;<br /><br />-&quot;Why the fee of course what else??? It will be 11% next year...and so on &quot;<br /><br />- &quot;How about for every gram of weed you send me, I&#039;ll +1 you....have you ever heard of a vendor begging for good Karma....reeks of desperation...remind me to give you a wide birth&nbsp; &nbsp;lawl&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Goblin the only thing you bring to this place is your excellent gobbles. Now get on your knees and gobble my pork sword.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Basically the only good thing she is used for is sucking penis, there I&#039;ve spelled it out for your dumb trailor trash arse.&quot; <br /><br />- &quot;A while back one member actually proposed a business idea, churn out cheap t shirts key rings and so on.&nbsp; The thread and thought has already been asked and discussed so move on.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;O,P how dare you, you have already been beaten now you&#039;re acting like a nigger. How about you go and front it like a man, instead of asking for help gay boy. He&#039;s gunna beat your black ass for this.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;So there&#039;s no problems, you just wanted some attention. Bless, scammers die in hell...now why didn&#039;t you just say that?&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;No he is stable, you on the other hand are a fraud. You eastern european&nbsp; scum bag selling fake shit.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Some people don&#039;t claim to be admin/mod of Atlantis do they. So go and get fucked you fucking wanker. Have you seen DPR act like that?&nbsp; No we all spam, but we don&#039;t half way through claim to be a Mod then admin.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Good riddance to bad rubbish......snapping at DPR&#039;s heels. Looks like your little doggy has been put down for good.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Of course you yanks have a sense of humor or you wouldn&#039;t have a wog running the country lawl.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Don&#039;t patronize me, fool.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;you are kidding right?? fuck off you imbecile. As if people are going to tell you.&quot; <br /><br />- &quot;Are you having a laugh 24 hours?&nbsp; try half an hour.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;You&#039;re going to have to hit the street and pull some moves, a kilo here a kilo there and pay cash, of course the street dealers aren&#039;t going to be able to spot them are they??<br />Then you open a vendor account and sell the product you purchased with your fakes&nbsp; ;)&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;This is a sellers market, the buyer gets stiffed left right and centre&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Are you still whining? cry me a river...these dicks wind me up, not only are they making good money anonymously, but they still find stuff to moan about. How about you get demoted and then what are you going to do??? starve.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;Ha!&nbsp; illegal, I know but so are drugs. Its just they are so dam good.&nbsp; Beautiful teenagers and their tight snatches.&quot;<br /><br />- &quot;I like how you slipped in the old fact that it wouldn&#039;t bother you if they had sex with teenagers. Get yourself over to primeassteens.com and let off some steam.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Please be aware that the above are John&#039;s words and NOTHING to do with the MACHINE ELVES.<br /><br />Pray for the weak - nobody likes a whiner.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br />MACHINE ELVES

				So how many people have viewed but not voted??? Because they think you are a complete and utter childish baboon. 1 dickhead called suffix, and plenty of people who like me think this is childish.<br /><br />I&#039;m glad you have the time to quote me verbatim. Looks like you are a fucking illegal immigrant. Guess what dickhead you have asked this before in the newbie forum under a different name.<br /><br />Lie and I&#039;ll find the thing, you have too much time on your hands. What a complete and utter piece of shit. Let me tell you despite your stupid illogical PM I have 2 buyer accounts and a vendor account.<br /><br />Tell me in your infinite wisdom, what fucking black list. You are a little maggott let me tell you about SR, you know fuck all and no-one.&nbsp; Now tell the truth dickhead, how many times have you asked this question in other accounts..before you answer it&#039;s already in the search bar wanker.<br /><br />Now do us a favour wanker, go and jump of a cliff you childish barstard.

				&nbsp;:)&nbsp; Hey suffix,<br />You&#039;re right about Mutley and DD. But The Hooded Claw was the main villain and the alter ego of Sylvester Sneekly, Penelope Pitstop&#039;s guardian.<br />Truman Capote was friendlier with Harper Lee and a totally left field suggestion !! :-) <br /><br />There was cross over between the two shows, &#039;the voice&#039; of Dick Dastardly was also &#039;the voice&#039; of a couple of the AntHill Mob but the two main protagonists were different guys....<br /><br />Geek or what :-) <br /><br />Namaste<br /><br />Machine Elves
