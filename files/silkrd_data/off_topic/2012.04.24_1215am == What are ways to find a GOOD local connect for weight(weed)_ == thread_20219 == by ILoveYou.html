				I live in the South Eastern area of the USA.<br /><br />SR has helped me find a good connect, but lately I&#039;m moving through too much weight too quickly and I can&#039;t really afford(riskwise) to get $2000 worth of bitcoins every single week. <br /><br />What are some tips to meeting a good connect/grower in the least non-sketchy way as possible. Ultimately I want to find somebody who I can build a good relationship with so when we need to meet up, it isn&#039;t all sketchy and nerve racking. It would totallly beat having to wait, and the sketchyness of the mail system etc. <br /><br /><br />What are some tips, I can use, to meet people who would be able to help me out in this manner. Out of all the people here, there must be some good knowledge floating around. <br /><br />and If you live in NC then holla at me.

				That&#039;s a tough question because it really does depend on the area you live in. <br />You&#039;d honestly have to make friends if you want to get to a good source without being ripped off or arrested.<br />I made all my connections back in high school so it came easier for me.<br />Like I said just find some stoners around your area, smoke with them, become friendly with them and eventually you&#039;ll meet some dealers. It&#039;s not gonna happen overnight but sooner or later if you get out there you will find new connects. <br />Start slow, go to a local park or something like that, eventually you&#039;ll find some smokers, walk up to them, light up a joint of your own and the hunt begins there lol.<br /><br />That&#039;s the best advice I could give you =/<br />Dealers aren&#039;t exactly leaving their names on billboards for people to find them haha.

				Do like the DEA does. Scare the shit out of someone who has personal amounts of pot with guns and damage to private property, demand to know where they got it from and then move up in the chain until you find a supplier. Or, you know, ask. But what&#039;s the fun in that?

				How do I meet other dealers when the stoners that I hang out with, have ME as their dealer? I have masses of friends. <br /><br />Do I just ask who else they know, and ask them to introduce me? At this point, do I just keep asking, and ask to hang out with and chill with some of their other dealers and keep moving up the ladder?<br /><br />How do I just start hanging out with other dealers if I&#039;m meeting them as so and so&#039;s dealer? They&#039;re not just going to tell me who they get it from..<br />

I&#039;ll just get Supar Dank weed on SR that nobody around here has layed eyes on, and use it as a sort of attraction tool to get others to come toward me :). It seems a many dealers I know would love to have some personal that is better than the shit they sell.

				I know that piece of advice all to well. <br /><br />Only thing is it takes time to build relationships and if I just jump up the ladder to quickly the chances of getting robbed by some RandomFag increases

				The answer is not to look for new connects at all. If you are going through $2000 a week then you can afford to set up a grow op. You may as well do this because it maximizes the output of your invested capital and it means you can step up the amounts you can sell, have to do less face-to-face dealing on a frequent basis and you can move up the ladder quicker. <br /><br />If you want a hand on learning how to launder money I can help you out there too and I have decent references. <br /><br />If you are interested PM me.

				If you&#039;re interested I have a very nice, discrete growbox that I bought last year but stopped using because people in my household were unhappy about it. It&#039;s a short box, meant for short dense plants. It has 2 fans built into it, a tub with 6 nets which means it can carry up to 6 plants, I even have sponges I can provide you with. I can even give you the lightbulbs you need both for growing and flowering. It has that really nice quality foil surrounding the whole inside of the system for excellent light reflection( I forgot what the materials called) and 2 latches that you can put 2 masterlocks or whatever type of lock you please on them. It has the built in water pump to stop the roots from dying. Overall it&#039;s a great little system. I paid like $280 for it but I&#039;ll pass it on to you for half the price like $140 or something like that.

				Oh yeah I forgot to mention I also have an automated timer that I bought separately for it, I&#039;ll throw that in there too. If you bought it from me I have experience with using it so I can guide you through any help you need.

				Like others have said the best connect for good weed is YOU.<br /><br />A grow box or grow tent at 1.2 M sq is enough to supply you and even a hard toking missus!&nbsp; ;D Plus relatives can get cost price.<br /><br />Any left over you should sell here to pay the electric bill, water, plant nutrients and so on. <br /><br />Anyone spending $2000 can afford to grow.<br /><br />That said some cannot grow due to circumstances. In that case consider moving? Plenty of people make the grow pay the mortgage. <br /><br />Failing that the BEST way to connect is have your sister marry a grower.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Worked for me!<br /><br />Now I get a smoke at amazing prices and lots of samples.<br /><br />I&#039;d go gay and marry him myself. But maybe taking one for the miners up the mineshaft for a smoke is a step too far ::)<br /><br />To each their own though.
