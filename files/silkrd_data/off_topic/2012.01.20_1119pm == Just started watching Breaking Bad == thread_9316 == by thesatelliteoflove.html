				I wouldn&#039;t nec say Meth is my DOC. Only because I don&#039;t have just 1 DOC..But, I do have plenty experience with it. Only using and obtaining for friends, never been a &quot;dealer&quot; or &quot;cook&quot;. But, after watching aprox 12 episodes, I cam e to the conclusion that it&#039;s pretty right on...as far as that end of the game goes. (The &quot;Cook&quot; end, that is).&nbsp; Now, I am always very careful to stay FAR away from the dope game... Only get small amounts, from 1 source..use at home. I have known alot of people who have gotten themselves deep into the game, known plenty of &quot;cooks&quot;. It&#039;s NOT a pretty world, and it can be fucking intense; Breaking Bad is pretty right on. The only thing that REALLY stuck out at me was this: Whilst cooking meth, just being in the same room, respirator or not, U get LOADED. Goes into ur skin... So- cooking in your underwear isn&#039;t something you would do if you didn&#039;t use/ were very worried abt the drug getting into your system. AND you wouldn&#039;t just go home and touch your pregnant wife... Anyone else have an opinion on this?

				Both The Wire and B.B. are great.<br /><br />I am in the 5th season of the wire now and have seen all the B.B&#039;s so far.<br /><br />I think The Wire could have possibly been better than B.B. but it branched off in a weird direction it seems.&nbsp; I just started watching the series a few months ago and am almost done.&nbsp; I won&#039;t go into specifics b/c other people might wanna watch so..<br /><br />I do think B.B. is better OVERALL because of this.&nbsp; I REALLY enjoyed the first season of The Wire.

				I&#039;m not surprised there are a lot of fellow Breaking Bad fans here&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; The show is awesome, I&#039;d say the best drama series ever made.&nbsp; Bryan Cranston was born to play the part of Heisenberg, talk about great casting.&nbsp; People here have also mentioned The Wire, which is a great show but I didn&#039;t like it quite as much as Breaking Bad, saw all seasons of it too.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s an amazing show but I didn&#039;t like it as much as Breaking Bad, there were some episodes that weren&#039;t that interesting.&nbsp; I highly recommend you guys all check out Justified, the series started off a little slow season 1, but has been building up to be absolutely fantastic and the 3rd season on right now I&#039;d say is by FAR the best thing on TV at the moment.&nbsp; So go grab some of your favorite weed or whatever your drug of choice is and plonk your butt on a couch and do a Justified marathon, you won&#039;t regret it especially once you reach what the series has built up to with the latest episodes.<br /><br />I also like Boardwalk Empire, but the 2nd season was kind of meh... so If I were to list these shows in order of preference it would be like this :<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Breaking Bad (keeps getting better and better)<br />2.&nbsp; Justified (keeps getting better and better)<br />3.&nbsp; The Wire<br />4.&nbsp; Boardwalk Empire

				You know I&#039;m surprised none of the meth vendors on Silk Road sell meth shards with blue dye in it, and call it &#039;Blue Sky&#039; for the novelty of it, heh. Or they could take Jesse&#039;s idea and add chili powder. lol.
