				<br />There is a disparity in all things in the world, dividing the haves from the have nots. It doesn&#039;t matter whether this is in the realm of the legal system, political influence, finance or criminal activity. Those in places of power hold onto it through networks. They realize that by agreeing to support one another they strengthen their own individual positions and keep others from getting in and taking a slice of what they&#039;ve already stolen.<br /><br />I don&#039;t blame them for this at all. But I think there&#039;s much to be learned. Most of us don&#039;t have the ready liquid cash to outsource our problems away or further amass personal fortunes. But what we can do is provide a latticework for ourselves.<br /><br />To this end, I propose a criminal enterprise for the rest of us. The Gentlemen&#039;s Agreement (not that it&#039;s open only to men, I just liked the sound of it) is a concept in which people with needs and skills would be able to find one another.<br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s the need of an alibi, a dead drop, money laundering, hacking, forging or counterfeiting, muscle, guns, black market sourcing, buying or selling, storage, any etc. you can think of, really, the Agreement would be a common way to organize and find support beyond any of our individual needs, playing on various strengths.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about the concept for a while, but how would such a thing be set up? I&#039;d be interested to hear ideas.

				What you&#039;re looking for is an underground barter economy. Usually the barter is money for services, but sometimes, they can lead to other things.

				I don´t think he means that. I think the idea is more along the lines of favor bank maby... Today you help me, but always remember the favor because one day I will call on it. Example, you got your stash robbed, you call me to get it back, I do so. 4 months later I´m being questioned by police and need you to say I was with you on a certain night. You say I was, favor re-payed, and in the process we trust each other a bit more.. The only reason I don´t think this would work here is because everyone needs/wants to remain anonymous, that severely restricts what we can do for one another. <br />ACE

				This would be the exact kind of society we would be living in. All men being equal with their specific skills being essential. Everybody needs somebody.

				We all want to be millionaires. But remember well that there is little rest for the big criminals. The bigger of a player you are, the more heat you will attract. Very few criminals - not counting bankers and politicians - got away with millions and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />Many small time criminals have low intellect. If you are smart and security conscious, you can fly under the radar, and make some nice money on the side. You won&#039;t get super rich but you&#039;ll live comfortably.<br /><br />Be safe and don&#039;t be greedy.
