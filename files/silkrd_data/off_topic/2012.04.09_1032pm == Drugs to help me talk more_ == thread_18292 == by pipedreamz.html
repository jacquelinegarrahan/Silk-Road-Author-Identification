				Mdma but in a small amount- just dont take a huge dose, very light and youll have a big old smile on your face and everybody will be very interesting and awesome- that or Adderall- i used to either get all my work done immediately or make a good group of friends every time I took that back in the day

				funny you should mention nootropics.<br /><br />just got my five pill thinkdeep sampler today.<br /><br />curious to see how this stuff performs for me at work tomorrow.<br /><br />I wonder what a good dose of mdma would be to get this effect (as well as a nice buzz) without being obviously rolling... maybe like 50 mg?

				I am a very quiet person and for me it takes alcohol + any one of mdma, adderall/ritalin/speed or cocaine to really get me talking around people I don&#039;t know well. I find those drugs also take away the stupidity that comes with heavy drinking. But I find combining alcohol and drugs is really hard on my body and I usually spend the entire next day lying in bed feeling sick so I don&#039;t do it very often anymore. <br /><br />I like phenibut for decreasing social anxiety. It doesn&#039;t make me talk a looot more but it makes me more comfortable and relaxed. Plus it&#039;s a lot harder to get too fucked up compared to if you are drunk and using stimulants.

				I took 20mg 4-AcO-DMT and since that day haven&#039;t had a lick of social anxiety. <br /><br />Less ego = less anxiety, IME. <br /><br />MDMA is very good for taking with yourself and for introspection as well. <br /><br />Cocaine can work well in social situations. <br /><br />Xanax (2mg) before going out is also pretty baller, IME. <br /><br />Piracetam + alcohol is absolutely hilarious, IME. <br /><br />Alcohol + memantine = derealization + high = less social anxiety. <br /><br />You could look into stuff like 5-MeO-MIPT as well, it&#039;s less damaging for your 5-HT receptors than MDMA, and purportedly has the same effects, if not better. I&#039;ll report back ;)<br /><br />

				MDMA worked for me, although the first time I did it I think it made me talk too much and too fast.<br /><br />MDMA shouldn&#039;t be done more than once a month, though, as it is neurotoxic. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if it&#039;s the ability to emote then MDMA.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>MDMA increases your confidence as well as your ability and desire to emote.

				cocaine is THE social drug, IME there&#039;s no point in taking it if you&#039;ve got nobody to talk to. especially the washed stuff because you don&#039;t get the bulging eyes and chin wobble you get with the unwashed stuff. the washed stuff creeps up on you - you do a tiny line and 10 minutes later you&#039;re thinking &#039;man i&#039;ve been conned&#039; because you can&#039;t feel anything, then another 15 minutes later when you&#039;re in an in depth conversation with someone you barely know you realize &#039;man this shits good&#039;. and you only need a tiny 1 inch line to do you near enough 3 hours.<br /><br />i do agree with the mandy or E if you want to get empathetic though, you can have some real deep meaningful conversations on that shit. <br /><br />with coke it&#039;s more of a talking bollocks situation, whether you&#039;re discussing how Jabba the Hut got to be the international gangster he is, or how much the price of petrol has gone up. with mandy or E it&#039;s more like how you feel about petrol going up or how Jabba the Hut would still have feelings....

				MDMA will allow you to walk up to total strangers and start talking to them as if nothing is awkward. Like you said just take small amounts because you don&#039;t want to be saying how much you love everyone in a normal environment. You&#039;ll just seem weird (unfortunately). But yea MDMA breaks down all social anxiety barriers and just makes you feel happy and genuinely interested in talking to people.

				Also one that was clearly forgotten that definitely makes you talk is Mephedrone (as long as it&#039;s the real deal, not the 4-MEC/4-EMC combo shite). I feel that MCAT gives you Cocaine&#039;s &quot;Let&#039;s discuss how Jabba the Hut is really The Notorious B.I.G&quot; bollocks chat as well as it breaks down social barriers but not to the point where you are absolutely in love with someone because they live in the same postcode as yourself. It also lasts only about 45-90 minutes per rail so you can easily top it up or tone it down if needs be. MDMA is one of those things where if you bang it you are on it for the duration so it&#039;s better to be with other people who are also on MD because it&#039;s more of a collective experience. Cocaine and Meph are a little more &quot;as-and-when&quot; you need more with shorter durations.<br /><br />Little bit of a ramble there but I hope it&#039;s of some help!

That shit is what life is all about, &quot;The Spice of Life&quot; itself even! Also I think when it comes to being able to talk to people you just gotta believe in yourself as well g. I am guessing by this comment you get a bit nervous talkin up birds right? You just gotta remember that there is no reason why YOU shouldn&#039;t talk to anyone? Why fucking shouldn&#039;t ya? You are just as much as a person as everyone else. :) Also you just gotta find out what your edge is, everyone has one. For example I ain&#039;t the best looking guy (bout a 7 out of 10) but I just know how to chat-the-shit and make a bird laugh and feel good. That&#039;s how I play it. You just gotta work out ya edge and you&#039;ll be on it! :) Sometimes a little bit of happy powder can help though.. ;)<br /><br />If I am totally off base here sorry for that ramble, I was just going off what ya said in ya posts.

				aaahhhh, i get it now (i think, anyway but i do have a bit of a chemical hangover so i might be well off)- this entire thread is basically cos you want to know how to chat birds up? you need a confidence boost mate, not something to help you talk more. if you&#039;re more confident in yourself the conversation flows a hell of a lot easier than you being simply chemically enhanced. <br /><br />in that case i stand by my original suggestion, but slightly modified - a LITTLE line of coke. just a little bit - coke is pure confidence in powder form. just a little bit though, you don&#039;t want to gurn at em, stare at em with bulging eyeballs or scare em off by jabbering shit at them

				Everybody keeps on giving him drugs that will help him talk more, but nobody is really focusing on the fact that drugs can bring people together. If you have trouble meeting friends and other people, talk to those with drug interests like yourself in person. It worked wonders for me when I was in high school and just asked somebody if they&#039;d like to smoke a bowl at lunch with me. It really does help you get closer to people. However, I would suggest you stay away from addicts and just people who are plain ignorant. Once you find out that people aren&#039;t so bad once you have a common ground, you will gain encouragement from the sheer fact that people have accepted you.<br /><br />If I&#039;m going into depth too much, stop me, but use drugs for fun with friends. People who smoke together become closer, same with taking psychedelics. Just find people to enjoy the experiences with and you&#039;ll soon learn that people are pretty easy to talk to. :)

				I wouldn&#039;t say that the whole smoking puff brings everyone together thing is universally true to be honest. Like personally I can&#039;t stand puff, makes me depressed, p-noid and lazy. I think you have to find the substance that best fits your personality and lifestyle. I for example love Bing and MDMA but apart from K I&#039;m not really into psychs. Other people like taking Cid and smoking dope but hate Bing. Each to their own is the phrase of the day.

I hate to admit this, but this post is coming from a 26 year old. I very much relate to what you&#039;re talking about. I wish I knew more people in this area that smoked and were willing to do drugs with me. But that shit gets harder as you get older. Your current friends get girlfriends and wives and become domesticated, it gets harder to make new friends as your not in school anymore and it&#039;s not obvious who the smokers are anymore or where they hangout. You become reliant on bars to meet new people. I wish there were marijuana bars, I&#039;d be there all day.<br /><br />In fact, I would go so far as to say I&#039;m somewhat biased in favor of drug users. Nothing against the straight edges out there, but I feel that a willingness to use drugs demonstrates a certain open-mindedness and a certain willingness to think critically about contentious issues, and that these qualities are heavy indicators that someone is like minded.<br /><br />Need more input. Wondering if I should try MDMA or coke first... you all make great arguments for both.

				seems like you narrowed it down to yay or mdma. i would say try both coke and mdma on separate occasions when you go out. they will both do the trick. only thing with coke is that it doesn&#039;t last as long so you would have to keep making trips to the bathroom if you&#039;re at a bar. plus you can always find some girls/guys that want to do some coke so that also helps. <br /><br />edit: mdma is a night long commitment.<br /><br />^^ having said all of this i like mdma better&nbsp; :)<br />&nbsp;

				Advantage of MDMA is that it potentially also could deblock the more deep underlying issues. For maximum effect i would suggest taking a &#039;normal&#039; dose and not a small 30-50mg one. Go to a place where it doesn&#039;t matter how you behave, not that you have to worry about that really, but you might as well go somewhere where you can level with people (that&#039;s why raves are good places).<br /><br />My experience is that not only in the direct aftermath you stay opened up, but up to 3-6 months. In that period you could also experience once or twice with smaller doses at social occasions. <br /><br />Like said here Coke makes you more confident, but there is a significant chance you&#039;ll get dependant (not directly fysically) just for these effects. I&#039;ve seen a lot of ubershy people get obsessed with coke just for this reason. Same for alcohol btw.

(im guessing i have between 100 to 200 mg left, really should invest in a mg scale).<br /><br />I know I took at least 150 mg because I was generous with the amount I took after the first initial pile.<br /><br />I know I was thinking low dose, but I said fuck it. I wanna roll proper.<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m afraid to report that I was kind of disappointed.<br /><br />It definitely felt like I had taken something, but I didn&#039;t have the waves of orgasmic euphoria rolling through my body the way I remember the last time I ate Ecstasy.<br /><br />Anyway long story short, I still ended up sitting alone on a bar stool waiting for someone to talk to me. Bleh.<br /><br />I know that what I took was MDMA because I intentionally bought it from the person with the best reputation for that stuff on this whole fucking site. This leaves two possible theories as to why I was disappointed:<br /><br />1) We under-dosed. I seem to remember somebody telling me that the pill I ate the first time I rolled was a &quot;double stack.&quot; I remember blowing that off at the time thinking, &quot;yea whatever. if this pill gets me high, awesome. if not it sucks, i don&#039;t care how many stacks you claim it is.&quot; But in retrospect, if it truly was, then maybe I should have gone for an even larger dose than 150-200.<br /><br />I was going by erowid recommendations.<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2) The drug I had previously associated as ecstasy may have actually been MDA, and not MDMA. And in this case this would have been my first time taking MDMA.<br /><br />Anyway six-eight hours later we ended up doing some cocaine. I only have a little bit left now, and was going to use it to try and go out on as well. But I&#039;m tempted to just say fuck it and do it today. Fucken love this drug.<br /><br />Anyway test 1, MDMA. Fail.<br /><br />Still have the mephedrone to try though.<br /><br />UPDATE: a little more research has revealed that the vendor may have the best reputation on this site, but not so much for that specific drug. I have learned a valuable lesson this day. Not to judge the quality of a drug from its vendor&#039;s reviews for other drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>which vendor did you get this from? and when did you order/receive this? it&#039;s probably the same vendor i recently ordered from... trying to gauge if we received the same batch.

				When I&#039;ve done MDMA, I&#039;ve gone all out 100-200mg + a bumper for an all night party alone with a lady friend. If I only do 50-70mg in a social setting, how obvious will it be that I&#039;m high? How much will my pupils change? Thanks!

				dude...25i nbome is where its at. <br />heres a little about me:<br />i say less than 100 words a day unless i have to, or unless im drinking alcohol or on drugs. <br />i hate human contact...i think all humans are fucking stupid, myself included, and i also think that the more you talk the more chance you have of saying something stupid.<br />in high school i met a girl and went out with her for 3 years, after that ran its course i was so depressed i kinda quit being myself. i was just a different person, i had to re-think my values and what not, idk. <br />anyway, i just moved in with a new group of people, and stopped smoking weed for 2 weeks as a little experiment to see if that would help me hate people less and talk to people more. (i smoke weed like a jamaican)<br />it helped a little, but i still knew deep down that the more i talk the more chance i have of saying something dumb.<br />so I went back to staying high 16/8, and i realized that i would never like human contact without the help of something medicinal. <br />so I researched this same thing, and after a day or two i narrowed it down to a few things. <br />I tend to cheap out on things because of my excessive weed habit, so I opted for the 25i nbome. <br />I took 1mg or 1000ug of 25i nbome and let me tell you...it got me out of my shell. <br />besides cocaine its the best drug there is for talking to random people or people you don&#039;t like. <br />even a couple days after i take 25i nbome it makes me talkative and outgoing, and i don&#039;t like the thought of thinking humans are dumb and the more you talk the more stupid stuff you say. <br />for lack of a better term, it just makes me happy. <br />I suggest everyone try it.

				adderall, amphetamines<br /><br />I personally recommend 4fa, don&#039;t take too regularly and control dosage though! It&#039;s a nice study aid that can turn you into a talkative dude with a slightly higher dose. Make sure to keep it within once every few weeks and don&#039;t dose over 150 mg or you might kill yourself.

				MDMA might be too much of a high for some one not used to it. Initially I always feel a bit of trepidation as the effect hits me. I was blown away by just 100mg of Ivorys MDMA. Going out you might talk too much and you really have to choose the right setting with MDMA. Its too obvious an high for the local pub (I still went) and a rave or D&amp;B night in some club would be way better. Dance floor and chill out areas. I prefer to sit down and talk on E.<br /><br />Speed is good if you take just enough. Speed allows you to smoke weed and drink alcohol like a professional. Downside is that good speed might be still ticking away 8-12 hours later so you need to take it very early if its potent. Taking it at 10.00pm in the pub was always asking for trouble. Taking it at 4.00pm or 5.00pm usually enables you to go out and sink a few extra beers. I also drink a pint of water when I get home. And drop a vitamin tab also. I won&#039;t rail or snort speed. I like to wrap up in a &#039;bomb&#039; and swill it down with water or beer.<br /><br />Cocaine&nbsp; ::) Well its good if your with a few others who are using it. Its also good IF you can just stick to a small amount and fly under the radar in the pub. But if your looking for a good women then forget the coke. My experience with coke and women was not the stuff of romance and lovers whispering sweet nothings. It was more like some 1970s version porno with her expressing disgust at 90% of my requests. She was missionary only girl and was a really big girl so I was limited in directorship and stunt co-ordination. The coke kind of got me into a few spots of consensual one night stands with women I&#039;d never have let near me when high on weed. Also some coke nights were spent with the kind of guys into steroids and door security and the coke talk turned into mainly talk of beatings, grudges and everything seemed so interesting with everyone nodding, agreeing, putting the comforting hand of the bro on someones shoulder and squeezing it. Gesturing with hands and knowing glances as we were told the &#039;real&#039; reason for jimmy whatever being beaten with baseball bats. <br /><br />Coke is good to have with close friends who also use. You need to talk on this. Its so expensive that you kind of want to get out and socialize and enjoy company and have company enjoy you. Too much and its paranoia, moodiness, limp manhood and the missus even more pissed that not only have you come home at 4.00am - you bring it on home limp?<br /><br />So go easy! <br /><br />Mephedrone, this has its fans but after seeing a friend projectile vomit after taking 100mg or so - and seeing him pull out a wrap of coke to blot out the feeling. Mephedrone was cheap here in the UK and legal also. Grams were sold for £10 on the street and it was VERY big here for a while but since it was banned I have not heard of any street dealer offering this.<br /><br />I think speed would be the safest bet if you are just very quiet and not good at starting up conversations. Its an ideal drug for a long night. It makes you sociable but on lower doses not noticeably high. Drinking on speed is good. Yiu get a thirst and that beer sure tastes good. I&#039;m talking amphetamine speed by the way.<br /><br />One other idea is Modafinil - that is a wakefulness drug. Not used yet but might use tomorrow as its got a real long life inside you. People report over 12 hours later they feel &#039;awake&#039;. Not sure if its a party drug as such but mixing with alcohol is fine. <br /><br />Ritalin maybe? Ordered some. Not sure what to expect myself but read Erowid and seems like a cocaine/speed and even opiate kind of high somewhere.<br /><br />Opiates mellow you. Try some codeine and drink cola. I can smoke a weed on this and feel sociable. I know codeine is a lightweight opiate but I get it free and sometimes do this.<br /><br />Mushrooms, in a UK pub, first timer looking for social lubrication? Not really.<br /><br />Best bet is to go to the local pub every week and have a few pints. Over time people notice you. You become part of it over time. But if drugs can get you maybe used to socializing then you may pop in for a beer sometime. Make a pln to drink four pints and walk home. Beer is good for social lubrication and getting a little drunk makes you less swkward about talking to people.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />&nbsp;:)<br />

I tense up and I yell at myself in my brain to just fucking speak yet I can&#039;t. I dodge their starebacks when I look at them and it&#039;s just messy. So I drank and became an alcoholic. I did coke and became a cokehead. I did ritalin but only holed up with my ex in our house and we&#039;d stay up talking for days. Tried MDMA and I still fucking over think. I feel great but I&#039;m so focused on saying something stupid. Like she is a musician and another friend who would roll with us also was and here I am without any experience with playing instruments. So they would jam and I would sit in the fucking corner, enjoying the high but always stopping myself from not doing or saying anything. I even get anxious smoking weed. <br /><br />But that was awhile ago. I have grown and I&#039;m going to be getting RV&#039;s delivery soon and when I take it I&#039;m going to just literally let things roll.

I tense up and I yell at myself in my brain to just fucking speak yet I can&#039;t. I dodge their starebacks when I look at them and it&#039;s just messy. So I drank and became an alcoholic. I did coke and became a cokehead. I did ritalin but only holed up with my ex in our house and we&#039;d stay up talking for days. Tried MDMA and I still fucking over think. I feel great but I&#039;m so focused on saying something stupid. Like she is a musician and another friend who would roll with us also was and here I am without any experience with playing instruments. So they would jam and I would sit in the fucking corner, enjoying the high but always stopping myself from not doing or saying anything. I even get anxious smoking weed. <br /><br />But that was awhile ago. I have grown and I&#039;m going to be getting RV&#039;s delivery soon and when I take it I&#039;m going to just literally let things roll. And update then.<br /><br />This post was probably pointless.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No, I loved this post,&nbsp; Ican feel I relate to someone. I&#039;ve been through similar experiences, I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not alone.<br />I find the best way for me to become social, is to hang around my friend and let loose.<br />Or find that girl that, for some reason, I can just talk around.<br /><br />I&#039;m an INTP, so I&#039;m kinda like constantly in my head, in another world, viewing my concsiousness from a different perspective.<br />I think all the time.<br />But I believe I&#039;m mentally healthy, some anxiety.

				Wow at some of this advice, the dude was looking for help battling his social anxiety and you recommend coke, mephedrone and MDMA? These are drugs that should be used in moderation. If you want to open up to people I suggest seeing a psychologist, CBT has helped a lot of people overcome social anxiety. <br /><br />Some other recommendations people have made recommendations such as Ritalin and Adderall, they can actually increase anxiety in some people. If you&#039;re looking for instant help, try benzos such as Valium and Clonazepam but be careful as they can be addictive and have horrible withdrawals, always remember to taper off these meds. Phenibut is also a legal alternative for benzos but I&#039;ve never used it so don&#039;t know too much about it.
