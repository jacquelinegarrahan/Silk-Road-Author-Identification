This was revealed by the German government in a response to a parliamentary question.<br /><br />In response to the same question, the German government admitted that it had received several reports from the German foreign intelligence service, the BND, on the May 25 massacre in the Syrian town of Houla. But it noted that the content of these reports was to remain classified &quot;by reason of national interest&quot;, Like many other Western governments, Germany expelled Syria&#039;s ambassador in the immediate aftermath of the massacre, holding the Syrian government responsible for the violence.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at least three major German newspapers - Die Welt, the FAZ, and the mass-market tabloid Bild - have published reports attributing responsibility for the massacre to anti-government rebel forces or treating this as the most probable scenario.<br /><br />Writing in Bild, longtime German war correspondent Jurgen Todenhofer accused the rebels of &quot;deliberately killing civilians and then presenting them as victims of the government&quot;. He described this &quot;massacre-marketing strategy&quot; as being &quot;among the most disgusting things that I have ever experienced in an armed conflict&quot;. Todenhofer had recently been to Damascus, where he interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for Germany&#039;s ARD public television.<br /><br />Wring in Die Welt, Alfred Hackensberger noted that Taldo, the sub-district of Houla where the massacre occurred, has been under rebel control since December 2011 and is in an open plain, making it unlikely that &quot;hundreds of soldiers and Assad supporters&quot; could have entered the village to commit the massacre. (An abridged version of Hackenberger&#039;s report also appeared in Die Berliner Morgenpost.) Hackensberger visited Houla to conduct investigations for his report.<br /><br />He also interviewed an alleged eyewitness - identified simply by the pseudonym &quot;Jibril&quot; - at the Saint James Monastery in Qara, Syria. In contrast to an earlier report in the FAZ, which had claimed that the victims were largely Shi&#039;ites and Alawis, Jibril told Hackensberger that all of the victims were Sunnis &quot;like everybody here&quot;. By his account, they were killed for refusing to support the rebellion. Jibril added that &quot;a lot of people in Houla know what really happened&quot; but would not say so out of fear for their lives. &quot;Whoever says something,&quot; he explained, &quot;can only repeat the rebels&#039; version. Anything else is certain death.&quot;<br /><br />While traveling in the region of Homs, Hackensberger heard similar stories about the conduct of the rebels. One - now former - resident of the city of Qusayr told him that not only were Christians like himself expelled from the town, but that anyone who refused to enroll their children in the Free Syrian Army had been shot. Hackensberger&#039;s source held foreign Islamists responsible for the atrocities. &quot;I have seen them with my own eyes,&quot; he said, &quot;Pakistanis, Libyans, Tunisians and also Lebanese. They call Osama bin Laden their sheikh.&quot;<br /><br />A Sunni resident of Homs told Hackensberger that he had witnessed how an armed group stopped a bus: &quot;The passengers were divided into two groups: on the one side, Sunnis; on the other, Alawis.&quot; According to Hackenberger&#039;s source, the insurgents then proceeded to decapitate the nine Alawi passengers.<br /><br />That the German government would cite national interest in refusing to disclose its information concerning the circumstances of the Houla massacre is particularly notable in light of Germany&#039;s support for the rebellion and its political arm, the Syrian National Council (SNC).<br /><br />While France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have figured as the most visible Western powers supporting the rebellion, Germany has been quietly playing a major role behind the scenes. According to a new report in the FAZ, the German foreign office is working with representatives of the Syrian opposition to develop &quot;concrete plans&quot; for a &quot;political transition&quot; in Syria following the fall of Assad.<br /><br />John Rosenthal is a journalist who specializes on European politics and transatlantic security issues.

				You are putting too much into mainstream media and the common perception. First off you have to look at the entire Syrian situation as it has evolved over the past 2-3 years. Syria has the same problem the Palestinians have. When you can&#039;t control your borders you have no idea who is crossing them or whom they represent. Assad, although not a saint, has very little control over the events that are unfolding. The latest defections are a result of bribes and offers to not be assassinated if they just leave, not differences in opinion or questions of leadership skills. If you look back over the entire situation a disturbing reality begins to take shape. The United States, Izrahell, and Al-CIAduh are ALL on the same page and in total agreement with the &#039;regime change&#039; which America says is necessary. Taking these things into account a very different &#039;reality&#039; or perception begins to manifest, and the reality of it changes the very foundation with which we view the rest of our world.<br /><br />It is hard to say who is doing the damage. Assad doesn&#039;t gain anything by attacking his own people. Like Egypt and Libya it is doubtful that the people are initiating the attacks. I put my money(literally in my tax dollars) on it being a conglomeration of American &#039;NGO&#039;s&#039; which destabilize governments and economies, Izrahellis, and Al-CIAduh. John Perkins, Greg Grandin, and Philip Agee have written some excellent books exposing America&#039;s SOP in overthrowing democracies. What may have started out as grassroots organization have been usurped and taken over much in the same way COINTELPRO usurped and redirected America grassroots groups like the Black Panthers, TEA Party, et al. The best &#039;defense&#039; is controlling a position, and the dissent or expression of that position. Study &#039;insurgency and counter-insurgency&#039;. There is a manual distributed that explains that subject that you may find useful.<br /><br />Terrorism has a much different definition depending on which side of the spectrum you reside on. To best define it I would say that terrorism is the attempt by the economic, political, and military power&#039;s suppression of people seeking to put and end to the power structure they see as destroying their livelihoods and communities. That is NOT terrorism by and stretch of the definition. It is a survival instinct that is found within each of us.<br /><br />IF &#039;Al-CIAduh is all over Syria&#039; it is at the behest and support of the players that have the most to gain by destroying what currently exists, and that is NOT the &#039;Muslim community&#039;. I am not a proponent of any religion and despise all organized manifestations of it. I used to visit &#039;Information Clearinghouse&#039;. I stopped because I felt even they had an agenda that I didn&#039;t agree with and used selective censorship to prevent certain opinions from being being presented. You should be free to present your &#039;opinion&#039; and let the reader weight its relevance.

				Enemy, that&#039;s real good. And you lnow that for domer unfathomable (not!) reason, the US has for the last 50 years or so, tried to destabilize and bring into its orbit the Syrian government. A truly remarkable continuity of purpose, considering the different leanings of the diverse US administrations. <br /><br />Actually, not that remarkable if you think about it, just goes to show there&#039;s no difference whatsoever between democraps and repulicunts. They both want world domination.<br /><br />MockFrog
