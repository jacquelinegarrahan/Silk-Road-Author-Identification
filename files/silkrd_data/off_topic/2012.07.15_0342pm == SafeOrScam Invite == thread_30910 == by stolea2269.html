				Hey all,<br /><br />Hope it&#039;s not too forward of me to post asking for an invite. I recently placed an order with a clearnet RC vendor, and they aren&#039;t doing a very good job of filling my order/I have my suspicions that they made off with my $$. Anyways, I&#039;d very much like to post on SoS about it and warn others. If anyone has an invite they&#039;d be willing to spare, I&#039;d be more than grateful. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />S

				Hi all if anyone could help me out with a SOS referral code I&#039;d be most grateful, I&#039;ve asked my supplier but he and his friend don&#039;t have enough karma to supply me with one and I&#039;d really like to add some feedback for him which has really been done sufficiently since the end of last year and he definitely deserves it, comms are great, delivery times impeccable and he&#039;s a generally all round nice guy and as we all know every seller deserves gratitude and feedback if they&#039;ve done a good job, especially if it&#039;s been more than once.<br /><br />Would really appreciate the help if anyone here can do so.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />MM
