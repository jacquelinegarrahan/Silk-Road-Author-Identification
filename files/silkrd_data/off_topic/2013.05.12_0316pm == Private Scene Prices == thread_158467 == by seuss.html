				I can get sheets for 400 per. This is from quality crystal sourced from old ass Dead Heads. Its real hard to know which dead heads you need to be talking to.... A lot of people run around saying I&#039;m GDF bla bla bla. And 99.9% of the time those are not the people you want to know.<br /><br />Gram of fluff goes for about 20k, gram of silver can be as low as 12k. It takes years of hanging around in the right scene to meet the people you want to know and get them to trust you enough to hook you up. They will test your character. Its the kind of thing you can&#039;t fake. Beyond a certain point in the right direction in the drug scene you stop running into assholes as they get weeded out. I see this almost only in the L scene.

				They can be clearnet or they can be TOR lol they are forums of a LOT smaller communities all based off trust. No escrow, no vendor page, etc. You gotta usually have something to hand to the table though to be on one of them and be very trusted by someone on the board. I have heard some boards have group votes to let people in lol. But usually drugs are cheaper private scene than SR and IRL (at least in my area). But usually you gotta pick up large bulk too. <br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

The noob ones get busted sometimes because they have shit security, but even that is pretty rare. Some of them are completely closed to new members and only have like 80 members who have been working online with each other for many years. Even most of the bigger ones only have a few hundred members and they are usually all screened and voted in. Even the clearnet ones tend to be fine because the members use Tor to access them, there are plenty of hosts who don&#039;t mind hosting small drug forums and nothing has ever come of it. <br /><br />I have seen LSD for as low as $120 a sheet for 100 packs. The lowest I have seen single sheets go for is $350. A few years ago $400 was the standard price for single sheets, but the past year or so the prices have skyrocketed and the supply has dried up.

				WTF! I would buy sheets for 300 any day of the week! Shouldnt us SR users have those privileged prices?! <br />Seriously we all know LSD is cheap to make and very plentiful once you make it. Why are these vendors gouging us?<br /><br />I dont have time to become a hippie and years to meet the right people to finally get those prices.<br />When will a vendor hop on the marketplace and be my hero dealer selling tabs for 2.5-4usd each? I&#039;d happily make them rich :)<br />Plus we all know its the easiest thing to ship. A real cheap LSD vendor like Lucydrop was (if anyone remembers them) would kick some ass!

Ordering ten packs of LSD, or even grams of crystal, is much more common. The private forums where you can get such low prices tend to consist of big suppliers, vendors, retired vendors and suppliers, and their close online friends. If you are not in the market to spend $12,000 a month or more on drugs, are not a big supplier of drugs and are not good friends with somebody who meets one of the prior two criteria, then you don&#039;t have very good chances of getting on a private forum that has $300 a sheet acid. SR is way lower on the food chain, it is mostly random end level consumers buying ten strips for personal use. <br /><br />However it has been a while since I have seen really good L prices even on the private forums. These days $500 a sheet is more realistic than $350 or $400, and crystal is not very available at all.

				Typically it goes something like this (I mention LSD for example only, it is probably pretty much the same for all drugs):<br /><br />Big Supplier either synthesizes grams of LSD, or gets them from somebody who they know IRL who did.

Funnily enough though, DPR almost certainly makes the most money of everybody involved, despite not even being involved in the supply chain :) (although he deserves it as he is by far the most exposed target due to operating publicly and being the maintainer of a huge part of the supply chain communications infrastructure).

Also I&#039;ve noticed that the Swiss crystal seems to be on the art work more often, and White Lightning is on the WoW.<br /><br />But yes someone needs to get on here and undercut prices where they need to be.

				IDK how soon I&#039;ll be able to get you guys sheets for 400 (again, that&#039;s about what I pay right now) but my goal here is to start small with reasonably priced strips and see how that goes. Test the waters. Open up my supply lines a little better (I&#039;ve never asked for as much as would be required before), then start dishing sheets. They&#039;ll probably start around 600. I&#039;d love to eventually get them down to like 450. Again, wheels are being put in motion, and I will keep you guys posted. NO PROMISES obviously, seeing is believing here for me as well, so like I said, y&#039;all will be in the know.

				su.pplier was one of my favorite private forums. Nice sized user base, lots of activity, lots of different drugs at low prices and a really good sense of community. The Bible was the best private forum though, anybody here remember that place? <br /><br />Follow The White Rabbit, Follow The Green Biker, The Looking Glass, Binary Blue Stars, Su.pplier, The Bible, A Figment of Your Imagination&nbsp; were some old school (now long dead so nobody cares if their names are known) private forums.

And why did all those old ones get taken down?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The old ones got taken down because over time they splinter apart, people break off from an established forum and make a new forum that shares most of the same member base until it overtakes the old forum, etc. They are not so much getting taken down as they are evolving, changing admins, merging together, splintering apart, changing servers, etc. The life of a private forum tends to be fairly short, several months usually although in some cases a year or two. But the members all know each other and the groups kind of migrate together for the most part. <br /><br />For example, Sandoz Labs, a largely American / English Native community merged with The Bible, a largely European community with English as secondary language, when Bible was shut down many of the members went to RCN which then splintered off into FTWR which then turned into FTGB which then had someone on it splinter off into Su.pplier which broke apart into TLG, AFOYI and BBS (with the less trusted people on TLG and most trusted people on BBS), all three of which were shut down just prior to OVDB launching, which shut down but probably has a lot of members who joined SR after it went down.<br /><br />That is just one example of a migratory path. This shit has been going on for a decade now, with a lot of different &#039;original communities&#039; and &#039;forum lines&#039;. I am just naming one of many, the others I wouldn&#039;t want to name because they are not communities I had much of a role in. Another thing is that a lot of the really old forums have pretty much disintegrated due to lack of need, people talk with instant message programs now and have known each other for a long ass time. If you want something you just hit up one of your IM buddies and ask them to ask around for you. For example I don&#039;t even really need to be on any forums because I stay in regular touch with a lot of vendors who used to operate on forums. <br /><br />But there are definitely still a lot of private forums out there. I just don&#039;t really follow it much anymore. There are probably a lot more today than there were a few years ago even, over time the number of forums has always grown and I don&#039;t see why it would slow down really. Although one of the main phenomenon today is that people are on SR, so it is possible that SR kind of centralized everything to it. Instead of a noob forum starting and getting 100 members, then closing registration and another noob forum starting and getting 100 members, etc, all the noobs are just joining SR since it is so widely known and easily accessed.

				Interesting. Sounds a lot like how real work circles of LSD distribution operate. I actually just met a new connect, and I would not be that surprised if they&#039;re just on a private forum after reading all this lmao. I need in one of these! Or I&nbsp; could just go get some sheets.
