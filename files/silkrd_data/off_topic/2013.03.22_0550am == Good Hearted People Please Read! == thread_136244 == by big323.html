				So before you read this please understand I have not done anything like this in my life, so please don&#039;t judge or make assumptions about me. If this story strikes you as a sob story then so be it. I am posting this from an alternate account since I don&#039;t want to reveal my identity for obvious reasons. <br /><br />Let me start of by saying I&#039;m 19, born in Benin which is just west of Nigeria. At the age of 3 my parents migrated over to the US (all of us undocumented) through a source my father had, or at least that is what he told me. My early childhood up until 14 was like any other kid in the US. I went to school, my parents worked, food on the table, so on and so forth. At about 14 1/2 my father landed in some legal trouble which ultimately led to the discovery of both my parents being undocumented and of course they were deported. <br /><br />Both my parents made sure that I would not get caught up in the deportation issue and i was sent to live with a family friend. For the next year or so I was still a regular kid but the emotional toll it took on me started to take control. I became rebellious, never listened and eventually found myself drifting in and out of different friends homes. During these times I knew i had to get my act together. I was able to find a job working under the table for a construction company in my area. This was when I was 16/17/18 and I was making damn good money for my age. I was still staying with a friend but now I was able to help out with bills, groceries, all while going to school and eventually graduating. <br /><br />So right when I think my life is stable, it bottoms out again. Everyone working under the table for the construction company is laid off. The explanation we were given was because they had to &quot;cut back on expenses&quot;. Mind you, I live in a rural area where jobs are few and far between so this job was the only thing keeping me on my feet. Put yourself in my shoes and imagine trying to get any good paying job when you are African and undocumented! <br /><br />This is around the time i discovered the Silk Road. I had always been a pot smoker, buying off local kids but when i found this it was literally a gold mine in my eyes. Without a job I started ordering things to the home I was staying at, flipping them for a profit (hash, weed, edibles) until I was recently caught by my friends parents when they unknowingly opened one of my packages and found what was inside. They told me I had a week to get my things together and find a new place. So onto a bus I went. <br /><br />So this is where I find myself today; a [edited out] 100 miles away sleeping on the floor. I&#039;ve been here about a month and a half with two friends who were kind enough to let me stay. Unfortunately someone ratted me out to the housing department and I was able to reason something out with them and they have given me 10 days to get out. I literally have $125 bucks to live off of. I was able to contact a good friend who was able to hear me out on my story and offered me a job working at a deli in which his father owned. Only problem is this is in a different state. I plan on finding a way out there and this is where my plea for help comes in. If anyone could please please please help me financially through donations it would greatly be appreciated. Even if its a dollar anything will help. I&#039;m trying to scrounge up enough to at least get me a bus/plane ticket to the state where my friend is located. I&#039;ve seen a lot of giving people on the Road and I&#039;m in a time of need. I&#039;ve never been in a position like this in my life and going on the streets to beg is something I definitely want to avoid. I have no family, 2 broke friends, and no luck of finding a job in my area.<br /><br />If you think this is a scam, then so be it. If you choose to ignore, so be it. If you choose to help me out then that is solely based off you. I&#039;m just a regular person who wants to live a successful life. Like I said, anything will help. If you&#039;ve read this far I&#039;d like to thank you. <br /><br />I will list the bitcoin address below if you choose to help.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />14Lxo3JTuoMCV6ETTTGhBw2x95DaM9mWiX - address

				Damn man this story really makes me feel shitty. If I had any coin in my wallet I would help out buddy! What I would suggest is panhandling your way to where you need to go. I see the same peoople, stand on the same corners, every day of the week... They make 1000+ a day... About 50$ an hour. Your 19 so this would be much easier for you. Just make a sign that says your only 19 and need help. People will donate. <br /><br />Hope everything turns out alright, If I can suggest anything, private message a vendor named purplelotus. Check out his coupon collection, you can print them out at kinkos. But you must have a flash drive/computer. It would get you a load of free food and supplies man.

I actually have been using the coupons but those will soon be gone&nbsp; :-\. It&#039;s hard for me to ask for money over an anonymous network but if it comes down to it I may have to. Once again, thanks for your input.

				This is exactly like what happens whenever I drive by a homeless man holding a sign asking for my help.&nbsp; I look very closely at his hat, his shoes, his jeans, his jacket... realize he&#039;s cleaner and in newer clothes than I am... and then recall a study I was told about years ago done by Reader&#039;s Digest or some rubbish like that, where they stalked panhandlers and followed them home... only to discover they couldn&#039;t find a single fucking one that didn&#039;t walk two blocks away, get in a car, and drive off.&nbsp; That&#039;s usually enough to make me look away.<br /><br />I never give them any money.&nbsp; But the &quot;what if...&quot; still breaks my heart.&nbsp; For that: fuck you.
