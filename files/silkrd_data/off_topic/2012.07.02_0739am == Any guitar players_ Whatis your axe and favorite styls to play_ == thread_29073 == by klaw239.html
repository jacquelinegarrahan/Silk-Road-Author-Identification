				I am a Telecaster player my self. Nothing&nbsp; quite like&nbsp; a true Tele.&nbsp; The tone, the twang. So beautiful.<br /><br />Any other players here?

				I&#039;ve been known to play the git-fiddle from time to time. ;) Nothing beats being able to just jam out with LSD and a group of friends with an acoustic.

				I love my line 6 guitar port. highly recommend it. 99 bucks and hundreds of tones&nbsp; and online&nbsp; data base.<br /><br />I prefer low action&nbsp; but I love teles just cause&nbsp; their sound is so unique&nbsp; and with low guage strings through&nbsp; the perfect amp can sound&nbsp; &nbsp;almost&nbsp; as close to a pedal steel&nbsp; as you can get. It is just an all around perfect guitar unless you want to play metal&nbsp; but for country,rockabilly,classic rock, the blues,jazz&nbsp; &nbsp;the Tele is almost&nbsp; an all in one instrument.<br /><br />Leo Fender&nbsp; a true genius

				Schecter FTW!&nbsp; ;D Haha I love schecter guitars but I have a Gibson Les Paul and a Jackson V too and theyre not to bad.As for what I like to play would have to be metal.Theres nothing like that feeling you get and all that adrenaline when you just start shredding like a motherfucker.But I also enjoy playing older &quot;hippy&quot; music if its got good solos.Or if its jimmy page haha who doesnt love playing Jimmy Page licks?&nbsp; 8)

				I have a Custom Gibson SG which I installed old supro lapsteel pickups on the bridge, seymour duncan&#039;s on the neck, fucking screams. I added a Bigsby vibrato too, Ry Cooder style.......<br /><br />I also have a Taylor 12 string which I love. <br /><br />I mainly play experimental blues/rock
