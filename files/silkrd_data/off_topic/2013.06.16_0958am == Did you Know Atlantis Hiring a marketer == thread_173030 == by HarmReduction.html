				I am not promoting Atlantis - Just saw this on one of the forums and bearing in mind some SR users have been targeted bu Atlantis vendors -&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br /><br />Hi all. Atlantis Marketplace admin here. At the moment we&#039;re throwing around the possibility of hiring someone who is good at SEO/marketing services on the web. This would include things like (off the top of my head):<br /><br />Blog posts<br />Backlinks<br />Youtube videos<br />Social media<br /><br />This wouldn&#039;t be your normal job offer, however if you&#039;re looking to help the Atlantis marketplace grow, Litecoin grow, and would be willing to be paid in Litecoins, let us know in this thread or via message on this site.<br /><br />We think that this is a good chance for someone to get in early and be apart of our team. Naturally further down the track the entry requirements will be larger -- so we believe this to be an exciting opportunity to take advantage of.<br /><br />Basically you could consider yourself an investor, however you would be investing skills and not money. Your payment will scale with our growth. So far we&#039;ve seen a tremendous amount of interest and we&#039;ve only been live for a few days. We can already tell that Atlantis has a very bright future ahead of it.<br /><br />So let us know via PM or in this thread if you&#039;re interested, and list your experience and what you can do for us, and we will go from there.<br /><br />Just a side note, this entire process will be kept entirely anonymous, so don&#039;t feel like you will need to disclose any of your personal information. As you can already imagine, we are huge advocates of the anonymous Tor movement.<br /><br />(You can find us here: [CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion)

It&#039;s an open and public advertisement meaning that LE could potentially become part of the Atlantis &quot;team&quot;.<br /><br />Or because they require you to state your experience as a marketer, thus potentially revealing your true identity (they could sell this to LE or they could be LE themselves).
