				I mean, he made Anderson his little bitch.&nbsp; This was funny and entertaining, even if I am an Anderson Silva fan.<br /><br />The question is, how long will it take Anderson to realize that he wants a rematch?&nbsp; Or is Dana White wrong about all of that?&nbsp; <br /><br />Even more important is the question: What will the rematch be like if Anderson doesn&#039;t clown around and actually acts like a fighter?<br /><br />If Anderson refuses the rematch will Chris Weidman fight Vitor Belfort?

				Silva seems like the kind of guy who will be humbled by a loss like this, I think he lost himself in all the wins and publicity.&nbsp; Hopefully,&nbsp; he re-invents himself and I can watch him again :)&nbsp; Alot of UFC fighters are pretty narrow-minded and he used to be a nice exception.

				Hmmm... after watching that movie you think that he would throw a fight like that? I mean, if he was really to throw a fight he seems like the kind of guy who wouldn&#039;t even fake like he was fighting.&nbsp; It is certainly possible, but maybe he just lost and we shouldn&#039;t put comforting theories on a major sporting upset for once ^.^

				FUUUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you just told me he lost! Anderson Silva is MY MAN!<br /><br />DAMN! Spoiler Alert next time please! LOL<br /><br />Anyway, I have to watch it to see if he threw it. If he did it&#039;s because he was cashing in on it by gambling, in which case he will easily win his title back. If he gets no rematch right away, then it id Dana White telling Silva to throw it so he can have a &quot;comeback&quot; and kick everyone else&#039;s ass on the way up to fight whomever kicks Weidman&#039;s ass.<br /><br />Modzi

				ok watch all his past fights.. he plays around a lil bit .. but he actually trys to knock the guy out or submit him.. in the fight he was just fucking around asking the guy to hit him.. <br /><br />he was not trying at all.. <br /><br />and yes after watching it i do think that.. that was like 5 fights ago when it was filmed but even then u could tell he was sick of all the bs that goes with being champ sick of promoting sick of the stress..<br /><br />WATCH THE PRE FIGHT INTERVIEW HE STRAIGHT UP SAYS WHAT HAPPENS.. he even says he doesnt want a REMATCH BEFORE THE FIGHT!!! <br /><br />hes fucking damn near 40 years old.. hes rich for life.. and im sure hes gunna beat the shit out of every other guy he fights for the next 10 fights on his contract.. <br /><br />another reason i think is because now he can go and fight more since he doesnt have to only do fights for the tittle so he can get his 10 fights done faster.. and be done.. hes a trainer too.. prolly trying to focus on that.. <br /><br /><br />either way hes the shit best fighter in the world!<br /><br />and yes u should of put spoiler alert

				I&#039;ll have to watch it, but if he did throw it I don&#039;t know if I would agree or disagree :/ Meh, well if he is tired of it then it is at least nice that he chose to be happy. <br /><br />Either way, he is truly the best and one of the most down to earth.

				Did he &quot;throw&quot; the fight?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; You take a hard left hook from a very angry Chris Weidman and tell me how it feels.&nbsp; He went out like a light.&nbsp; Now, on a different issue, was there something &quot;wrong&quot; with Anderson?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Did you notice how his corner was telling him to &quot;calm down&quot; after round one?&nbsp; He really is fed up with his lifestyle, fed up with having no worthy opponents, and tired after this very long reign.&nbsp; You can hear that in the post-fight interview.&nbsp; <br /><br />The pre-fight interview did have plenty of foreshadowing, and yes obviously it was on his mind that he could lose.&nbsp; Given his difficulty at the top of the weight class it had some appeal to him.&nbsp; Also a lot of people were calling for Weidman to beat him, and that is not something that we&#039;ve heard lately.&nbsp; Maybe this seemed like a convenient out for him?<br /><br />If Anderson was fed up with being champ, doing ten more fights without fighting for the belt will drive him over the edge.&nbsp; If that truly is his thinking, it is piss-poor decision-making but then again it is hard to understand just how frustrated he feels.&nbsp; I think he felt trapped by the belt and by his fame.&nbsp; Maybe there was a sense of feeling unworthy of everything because his title defenses were so easy?&nbsp; Except the first Chael Sonnen fight of course.&nbsp; I really thought he would blow that one and the ending was a shock to me.<br /><br />Regarding spoiler alerts, well- I figure if you are a real UFC fan like I am you either pay for the fight or get on the torrent sites and download it as soon as it pops up!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; Sorry guys.&nbsp; I am just spreading the love since I got my spoiler from a news article.&nbsp; I thought I was reading a hype article but then it had details of the fight and as soon as I read that Weidman took him down in the first round I could not stop myself from reading further!&nbsp; Doh!<br /><br />

				MMA sucks. Well, it&#039;s an ok sport with meathead fans. Listen to Jim Rome rip MMA fans and you have my views.<br /><br />That said, I couldn&#039;t believe Silva didn&#039;t even seem to defend himself sensibly. It was bizarre. I do think Weidman is a serious and determined fighter, he may have a bright future!

				It looks like the rematch will be in February, or so say &quot;sources&quot; close to Anderson Silva.&nbsp; That is a long time to wait but Dana white has finally stopped sweating.
