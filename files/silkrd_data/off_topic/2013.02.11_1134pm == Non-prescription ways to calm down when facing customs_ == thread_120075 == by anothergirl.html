				I&#039;ve got it in my head to smuggle some powdered shrooms mixed into food.<br /><br />But ever since the point of basically no return, the frightening thoughts of this plan going wrong have come to haunt me morning to night.<br /><br />So it&#039;s safe to assume that, no matter how much I tell myself that dogs don&#039;t smell for shrooms and the only way my food will look any different from any other food is through a chemical test for the actives, when the time comes I&#039;m going to turn fucking white.<br /><br />I read about using Xanax and Valium, but it&#039;s kinda silly to find and smuggle more, even more detectable drugs with me to deal with the pressure of smuggling some damn magic food.<br /><br />Any other suggestions to take the edge off at times like this, chemical or otherwise?<br /><br />Also, please either pat my head reassuringly or laugh at me derisively for treating a few oz of shroom powder hidden in food like a suitcase full of bricks of coke.

				I would recommend against doing it. Just post them.<br />99% youd get through no probs but if your shitting yourself about it allready might be wise to leave that stuff to the 3rd world desperadoes.

				yeah - as warmkitty says - post them. you&#039;ve bought from SR before right, so you know how to wrap shit up to get through customs?<br /><br />failing that, have a wank or a shag before you get to the airport.<br /><br />else it&#039;s valium - just do them during the run up a few days before so you&#039;re used to them and you don&#039;t look like a proper space cadet at the terminal - once you&#039;re used to valium you look and act completely normal, just a bit tired

				Dont worry about feeling nervous its good. Nerves and paranoia are like prayers at the feet of the smuggling gods. Acknowledging its out of your control tips the karma scales in your favour. <br />Just make sure you just look at them with a curious expression is if your fascinated by what theyre doing, just dont do anything and if you get busted say you were sold them not a couple of hours ago before you got to the airport. Dogs wont typically be trained to sniff mushrooms anyway because its not a cash crop the maguc mushroom economy is pretty small as its the kind of thing I regularly get handed for free in season plus a decent trip is a significant disruption in your day to day activities so 247 use is unlikely. Within europe iv walked through customs with cubes of mushroom chocolate in an open bag of confectionery so dont sweat it and remember if the worst does happen you can still deny all knowledge andget off scott free

				Let me ask you this: &quot;do you feel you are doing anything wrong when you take your bag from one place to another?&quot;. <br />If you do feel you are doing something wrong, don&#039;t do it. <br />If you don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re doing anything wrong, then make shure that&#039;s what you are projecting: &quot;I&#039;m not doing anything wrong at all&quot;. <br />The power of your mind...<br /><br />I never thought (and still don&#039;t think) that I&#039;m doing anything wrong, <br />so I act normal, reply as usual to any question asked and feel confident, <br />because I&#039;m not doing anything wrong... <br />whatever some other people might think of it (LE) - me, I&#039;m calm and confident; I don&#039;t do anything wrong. <br /><br />

				I know the common knowledge is to mail them, but that feels even more unnerving to me. An organic powder shows up on the Xray and the inspectors can just take their time tearing apart my package while I sit at home panicked for days on end. Whereas at the airport there are thousands of people rushing in and out and I&#039;m just some person coming back from a legitimate trip with some food in my suitcase. I guess if I mailed them back home I&#039;d have to use the expedited shipping so they&#039;d arrive at home before me, but if that went wrong I would be unable to ever return to my country...<br /><br />And RaFaeL5, no I don&#039;t think I&#039;m doing anything wrong, of course. I think LE are doing something wrong. I&#039;m just doing something potentially idiotic.

				You should look into Reiki. Easily the most serene calming thing I have learned through my travels. Usually a hippie will give you your first attunement for free, and after that it&#039;s quite easy to explore your own energy. <br /><br />In case you&#039;ve never heard of it, Reiki is a hands on healing technique revolving around the transfer of &quot;chi&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; energy. If you&#039;ve ever played contact sports then you know about being &quot;explosive&quot; (in boxing, it&#039;s the snap of your punches. In football, how fast you hit after the snap) this is &quot;chi&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; energy at work. Rei ki (roughly translating to life energy) is just the spiritual side of this energy. Being in control of your energy, just like an athlete, is a must for any psyconaut :)

				shitting hell if you&#039;re thinking long term, shroom season starts in a couple months. post is safer. why exactly are you wanting to smuggle them on your person through airport security? if you&#039;re not totally comfortable with it then your behaviour will be a dead giveaway. <br />if for some reason you can&#039;t let them out of your hands then grind them up and put in caps in some vitamin supplements or chop em a bit and mix in a big bag of dried fruit and nuts or something. but really you&#039;re on silk road, why not use the mail system?! i just can&#039;t get my head round it
