				Quite frankly, the DEA should be defunded completely, dispensary raids are such a flagrantly wasteful expenditure. So they&#039;re going against the will of the taxpayers while spending taxpayer money to raid medical dispensaries and seize property for forfeiture to the DEA. That, my friends, is laundering money in its&#039; essence.

				I&#039;ve lived in a non medical state all of my life. Its always been illegal for us to have pot. Except for opiates, cannabis is the ONLY thing that helps with my chronic pain. It takes my mind off it for a little while so I can be happy and productive. Until I came onto the SR, I wasn&#039;t able to get real medicinal grade stuff. Some of the stuff we had was close (one good thing about being a pipeline state) but nothing compared to the wares around here. So I can relate to what those poor people out there losing their medicine that they worked and fought so hard for. It&#039;s not right. I also think the DEA should be shut down and people should be allowed to have the meds they need.

				*Update*<br />So I&#039;m keeping touch with several clinic owners and now they&#039;re worried. A lot of them are already selling out whatever is left of their stock because they have 45 days to shutdown or be raided/fined. I believe only ~175 shops are going to be left maybe even less but this is really bad news for people that are not even local to central LA. <br /><br />So far from what I understand the reason behind this turnaround is because of the elections coming up, the mayor decided to switch stances from pro-mmj to against it so that he can easily get more votes, that goddamn rat bastard&nbsp; :&#039;( We would need at least 35,000 signatures to overturn the decision but not a lot of patients are confident in even getting close to that amount. Let&#039;s all hope for the best because there&#039;s not much else we can do.

				Look on the bright side atleast Obama is cutting funds to police departments specializing in finding illegal grow ops. <br />Which ofc means there will be more domestic crops and the need for importing shitty weed will go down.<br />I would rather grow illegally then be regulated by the government any day like it currently is for medical growers.
