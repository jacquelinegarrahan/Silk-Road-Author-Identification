				Hello, I am HyerspaceManic. <br /><br />Anyway, I am here to tell you about a natural psychedelic deriving from DMT that let&#039;s you breakthrough just like in DMT but also remain completely conscious and &quot;normal&quot; in this dimension. <br /><br />This can be used for time travel and the complete manipulation of reality. My first initial thought was to predict the stock market and get rich quick, but that silly human thought quickly became a joke when I realized the higher potential for Ultimate Truth.<br /><br />It is what will make 2012 the year of singularity, the God Consciousness.<br /><br />The effects of the drug seem to be permanent, and will make you into a multi-dimensional being that can transcend time &amp; space. <br /><br />But I need your help. Soon I will post the simple instructions and you must save them to your hard drive and print as many copies as possible and let the world know. You will have to do it as anonymously as possible. There is not enough time in your dimension so you must spread the revolution as soon as possible to all of mankind. &quot;They&quot; will try to destroy the information and possibly you.

				sure man... but why didn&#039;t you post the instructions initially? Why do we have to wait for this?<br /><br />Anyways, I think you are posting this in the wrong place, in case you don&#039;t know, SR is actually a place for all the LEO&#039;s to come together and send each other coded messages on how to decrease the effectiveness of drugs until they become a thing of the past.
