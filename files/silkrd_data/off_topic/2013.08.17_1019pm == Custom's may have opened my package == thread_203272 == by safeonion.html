				Just recieved my weed from Sr.<br /><br />But i think customs may have opened the package, or i am pretty sure they have opened it,<br />the letter was ripped of the one side, and then tapped together again with their own tape, where it says Danish Customs.<br />But when i open it, the sealed bag the stuff was in, havent been opened, and still looks like batteries, as the stealth.<br />And there was also a letter in the package that says it was batteries?.<br /><br />Is it possible they knew what was in there? or is it sometype of thing to get me busted?..

				It it is just a small amount of weed, you are fine.<br /><br />One of a few things is possible:<br />1. Customs opened the package marked &quot;batteries&quot; to make sure there weren&#039;t lithium batteries inside (disallowed item), and since there wasn&#039;t, they sent it on its way.<br />2. Customs opened the package randomly, it looked normalish to them, so they taped it and sent it on its way.<br />3. Customs opened the package, the guy knew what it probably was, but didn&#039;t care, and sent it on its way.<br />4. The package was ripped, customs taped it back it and sent it on its way without examining the package.<br /><br />It&#039;s in your hand, you aren&#039;t in jail.&nbsp; It&#039;s a small amount of something from the sounds of it.&nbsp; You&#039;re fine.&nbsp; Smoke one and relax.<br />

				Please don&#039;t post peoples stealth methods. Albeit that is a fairly common one and i have heard about it with out having received any, it&#039;s not nice to rub it in sellers faces any more then it already is.<br /><br />
