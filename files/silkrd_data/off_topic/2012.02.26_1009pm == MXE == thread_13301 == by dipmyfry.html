				Mxe is probably by far the weirdest thing i have tried its just a really odd feeling its not that unpleasant but its not pleasant either made me feel kind of down actually when i try it in higher doses. Dont know why everybody loves it. I guess it does help me feel less depressed the day after or when im on it but only in small dosages under 50mg. Usually just do very small bumps whenever i do a large amount at once like anything over 40-50mg it just feels uncomfortable very close to dxm and i hate dxm i like psychedelics tho of many variety&#039;s, been meaning to try K but if its anything like this i doubt i even wanna mess with it. How do so many people love mxe ??

				Idk it just seems like it wont be worth it to feel the double effects of the highest amount ive taken 50mg at once if its just gonna feel like dxm i once was offered dxm , took some (high dose) for my first time un knowing what the effects even were or even what to expect and it was a horrible experience. If mxe feels and is similar to dxm on the feeling side i dont even want to do that id rather try K instead it lasts much shorter than mxe. Idk this is just my thinking on it. I usually onlu enjoyed it in very small amounts like 20mgs for some reason. Weird

				This is what dissociatives feel like.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t like it I would not suggest K.&nbsp; The first time I tried DXM I had 700mg and it was an absolute blast

				Having never done anything in the same category as MXT i wasn&#039;t really sure what to expect when i took it for the first time a couple of days ago. Ive done quite a few drugs over the past 10 years, and about a month ago me and a friend bought 5g of MXE and 1g of AMT with a view to selling them (both legal in the UK). However i didnt want to sell them until i had tested the dosages out personally so i opted for 30-40mg caps of AMT and 50mg caps of MXE. <br /><br />Tried the AMT and can honestly say one of, if not the, best drug i have done.<br /><br />Then 2 days ago we both finally had a spare night so we took 1 cap of MXE, after about 1.5 hours could feel some effects, colours slightly altered, maybe a bit psychedelic, defiantly slightly uneasy on feet but nothing unpleasent. Then we both dropped another gel cap. After say another hour i was tripping balls, nothing looked in the right perspective, although i could still move it felt very very very strange, vision kept altering and to some extent it was at times quite scary, maybe some OBE aswell. Came down after 5 hours which was not bad at all but i must say MXE is deffinatly not for me. My friend who has done Ket before said it was very much like his experience on Ket after we dropped the second cap and agreed that we both never wanted to do it again.<br /><br />Some quotes include &#039;I think im a robot&#039;, &#039;There is no gravity&#039;, &#039;ive taken too much muscle relaxant, call the ambulance (we didn&#039;t)&#039;, &#039;I think im dead&#039;<br /><br />Main problem is we are now left with just under 5g (4.8 give or take) of MXE that we really dont want :( Id open a sellers account but i wouldn&#039;t even recoup the cost of doing so. Guess il have to sell to some ketamine loving friends.<br />

				&#039;I think im a robot&#039;, &#039;There is no gravity&#039;<br /><br />Ah yes, I love floating around on MXE. You can&#039;t feel your legs and it&#039;s like your a ghost hovering around. And the robotic thing; it&#039;s funny when you see people on it and they start moving like that because everything for them in in slow motion. It&#039;s a fun drug really. I like it and it&#039;s cheap.

				You just aren&#039;t taking enough man. It&#039;s kind of like drinking and stopping when you&#039;re kind of drunk but not all the way there then saying being drunk is stupid. Or like having a lose dose of LSD and calling LSD stupid because you didn&#039;t get the effects of a 10 strip.

				Ehh I don&#039;t know if I would compare them.&nbsp; I like low dose MXE (10-40mg) just as much as 100mg+ doses.&nbsp; They are just different feelings.

				I think I&#039;ve said it in probably 10 different threads but MXE is my fave drug.&nbsp; I&#039;m starting to hear a lot about AMT and would love to get my hands on a sample.

Couldnt be exact about the doses cuz i habe no mg scale but roughly those amounts. It just makes me feel effects similar to a psychedelic headache. Ive taken plenty of acid and dont mind it at all in large doses;sometimes i like acid in low doses also but you cant really compare the 2. <br /><br /><br />Low doses i find more enjoyable and after trying it 3 days in a row i dont know what is so special about it or whats not so special about it just isnt that significantly appealing to me while tripping. K sounds like it would be more enjoyable for my type of trip.<br /><br />I originally got some for depression it has semi worked a little but not what i was expecting

				Why are you trying to go about your day while on a dissociative? You need to just sit down and let it run it&#039;s course. Don&#039;t focus on anything else. And eyeballing is not the way to go. Especially when giving an opinion on something when you don&#039;t even know what dose you were doing. I suggest getting a scale and trying again.

				Wasnt going on with the day was mostly reading watching tv or just straight chilling . i can measure 100mg with my scale i use for weed so i divide that into an accurate eyeball of two halfs and thats how i dose it. Ill keep that in mind and try it later when i can get a mg scale. Well see how it is hmmm

				Maybe you just have shit quality MXE. Is it yellow and grainy? It&#039;s supposed to be snow white and have the texture of dust and may glitter under light if it&#039;s pure. I still say do a 90mg bump before giving up hope.

				I&#039;ve had some of the most rewarding (blissful, joyful, intellectually stimulating, emotionally significant - including emotionally connecting with myself and others) experiences of my life on MXE. So much of it is psychological, and so much of it depends on how much self-knowledge you have (in my opinion). When I first started taking MXE, I became aware of how much darkness there was in my psyche. Instead of running from it, I decided to embrace it. After a while, I realised that this darkness wasn&#039;t just specific to me, but was a shared darkness of the collective human experience throughout history. I have realised how much we are connected, how much we have in common on such a fundamental level. Genuinely, we all want to survive and thrive, and for the most part, I think we really do try to do the best we can with the knowledge we have.<br /><br />I think that through this understanding of others, we can help empathise and sympathise better with others in our lives. With that, I hope we can find more peaceful relationships with our fellow human beings.
