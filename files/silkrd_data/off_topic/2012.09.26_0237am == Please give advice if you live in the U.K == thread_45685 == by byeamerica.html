				Ok if one were to move to the U.K what would honestly be the best places to live that are fairly priced and still a decent area to live and have easy transportation?

				Extremely broad question in my opinion haha but a big city or just outside a big city (usually best option if you like nature and not a lot of crowds)... I would say areas just outside London or southern UK towards Kent... quite nice there as well and good transport links. Not too expensive as well, London obviously is very and the closer you are the more expensive although some towns outside London can be as expensive (living=wise).

				I would say around Brighton area is a good bet, it&#039;s a good city down that way with lots going on but it&#039;s only a stones throw away from beautiful countryside and an hour away from the capital. <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Penguins

				I find your question too broad for me to answer, can you please expand? Which region do you wish to live in? South East, South West, Wales, London, Midlands, North East, North West, or Scotland? In the UK, presently, there are 66 official cities. The cheapest regions in terms of housing and living costs are the North East and North West, with the most expensive, obviously, being London. In the North East and North West you can buy a home for under £40,000 (I kid you not!), in London, depending where of course your looking at £250,000+, but think where first, in some areas you&#039;d stand no chance, however there are some lovely areas in the suburbs where this will suffice. It&#039;s possible to live reasonably in 90% of the UK if your shrewd, and do a little advance planning, especially where this concerns transport, but unfortunately not when it comes to UK&#039;s excessive petrol prices, it&#039;s unavoidable, it&#039;s very expensive, and you just have to accept it. Please let me know where, and I&#039;ll do my best to suggest :)

				Ok guys thanks for answering i was not clear on my first post i apologize but here is my story i am a pretty reputable vendor and a upcoming dubstep producer here in the u.s and i want to move to the u.k job would not be a issue as i have alot saved and my s.r buisness would actually be better if i moved to the u.k i think so im not too worried about job issues plus i am only 21 so i am young. But as far as where i want to move i was hoping to avoid london just because theres so many people and tourists i would like somewhere maybe close or in maybe brighton i hear is nice and alot of my fav electronic producers live there and i want to be in the scene.

But as far as where i want to move i was hoping to avoid london just because theres so many people and tourists i would like somewhere maybe close or in maybe brighton i hear is nice and alot of my fav electronic producers live there and i want to be in the scene.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As an up and coming dubstep producer London will be your best bet, the biggest dubstep following&nbsp; is there, and you want to go where the masses are to get yourself herd.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my rundown of the best Dupstep clubs in London, you&#039;ll need to know these if you come here, and aim one day to set at them:<br /><br />Fabriclive, is awesome, they have a bodysonic sound system that has to be heard to be believed, if you love dubstep, at least once in your life make this place your pligramage, you&#039;ll be glad you did.<br />FWD also occassionaly promotes at Fabric with Rinse Fm, the radio station where Dubstep was forged. Rise FM livesteam (clearwebalert) http://radio.rinse.fm/ - I listen to quite often, it&#039;s nice to respect the orgins.<br />DMZ - Is bloody brilliant, it&#039;s run by some of the most well-known Dubstep producers in London, they base their night from Brixton&#039;s Mass, it&#039;s the go to place to hear exclusive dub tracks months their public release keeping you in the know, great stuff.<br /><br />In terms of living costs, the cheapest part of London to live and buy a property/rent is in South East London, which works well for you as these clubs are in South London (South West London) however the drawback is some of these areas can be quite dodgy, you need to be careful when coming back at crazy o clock in the morning, but every city as these places, there are some very nice places to live there too. Do your research, recent improvements to the transportation network means that South East London isn&#039;t as cut off as it used to be, and most of the area is being regenrated and improved, it&#039;s seen as an up and coming place, which means it would suit you fine as an up and coming producer.<br /><br />True, there are many tourists and people in London, but this mainily in the centre and around the tourist attractions, if you move to a nice leafy residential surberb, you can have peace and quiet at home in a nice leafy area. If you moved to Brighton and communted to London by train it would take an hour, by car it depends from what part of London your living in and how much traffic, it can take between 1-2 hours. Brighton is expensive for property, but you will find neighbouring Hove very plesent, and quite a bit cheaper to rent or buy, and still your only 10-15 minutes away from Brighton, so that may work out well for you. I sincerely wish you the best of luck making your dreams come true! :)<br /><br />Source: A dubstep raver who has raved all over the UK, and will continue raving for many years to come. Long live dubstep! ;)

				I&#039;d like to chime in a bit on Bristol. Nice place, public transport is awful but its small enough to walk/bike around in and all the hills get you fit in no time. Its also easy enough to get in on the dubstep (or any) scene there with little or no contacts. Plus if job plans come crashing down you can seduce a new money girl with a load of drugs, move to her place in Clifton and sell product from the road to her friends.<br /><br />Weather is fairly bearable too.
