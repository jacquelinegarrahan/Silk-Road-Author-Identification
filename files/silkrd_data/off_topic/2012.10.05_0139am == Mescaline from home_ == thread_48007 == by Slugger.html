				Title: <strong>Mescaline from home?</strong><br />

				I already know mescaline is aquireable through methods that are local, as in, local supermarkets/garden centers. But my question here is, say I went to a local hardware store, and bought San Pedro (or I ordered P. Torch cuttings from E-bay), how much would I need to buy to be able to have a strong mescaline trip? Also, if I order it online, when I receive it I just can start making tea with it? I understand there is some prepping needing to be done with the outer skin and such, and it also needs to be chopped up to make the tea correctly.<br /><br />Anyways, my main question is, How much San Pedro/P. Torch cactus would I need to get a great mescaline experience? All suggestions are welcome.

				there is no way to tell... because the potency varies so much between plants unfortunately<br /><br />an average is generally considered to be a cutting the length of a forearm - way more slime than someone can eat<br /><br />i wouldnt suggest cuttings from ebay. i actually received one from there to grow, not to eat, and raised it for a couple years. it froze and died unfortunately so i harvested it and performed an extraction on about 4 feet, 3-4 inch diameter and didnt even get a single dose.&nbsp; weakest plant i have ever seen and a complete waste of effort<br /><br />ordered cuttings online from another source and a much smaller quantity produced a gram of mescaline <br /><br />best way is just get a substantial amount of plant matter and perform an extraction. that way you can measure doses accurately

				+1 for micro.<br /><br />Extraction all day. Plant material varies.&nbsp; I will say however that in all my years of performing mescaline extractions, PT is definitly the most consistent and free from non-mesc alkaloids. What you sees what you get :)<br /><br />However i will also say that if you are looking for just a trip, and you want to avoid extra costs for supplies for an extraction, then i would highly recommend the following for Snot Brew (&quot;tea&quot; - however it is NOT tea , yuck):<br />-PT chips (PT average .08% mescaline content by material weight) so, 0.08(x)=3 , find (x) for your ESTIMATED amount of PT needed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Procedures pretty simple.. mix your 37g-50g raw material with some water in a strong blender (otherwise motor might break if its a crap blender, these chips are ROUGH), add some lemon juice, blend some more, pour mixture out into pan, bring to boil, add more lemon juice, once boiling, reduce heat down to simmer, keep reducing the snot down for about 8-10 hours, adding all the rest of the lemon juice over time and water when needed (when its gettin too thin to simmer i.e. BURNING).&nbsp; Then about 6-8hours in, stop adding water and really focus on reducing that sucker down without burning.&nbsp; Then grab old T-shirt and make a bowl out of it with your hands, pour the snot into the shirt little by little (small batches work best when straining) and literally tie the ball of shirt snot round hard as you can and sqqqqqqqquuuuuuuueeeeeze that juice outta there. keep going and going, you want allllll that liquid. You can throw away the crap inside the t-shirt, dont need it.&nbsp; But its not ready to be chucked away until its almost not wet anymore when you touch it.,&nbsp; Then continue to do the same for the rest of the snot.&nbsp; Once its collected, theres your dose :) drink that sucker on a EMPTY stomache and wait 2 hours :) Come up Sex is great to pass the time :)<br /><br />Oh and dont puke, itll be tempting with the snot, it is literally the worst texture, smell and taste on planet earth IMO and not to mention that cacti have naturally nauseating properties anyway, you are in for a bumpy road haha. but worth it for sure. and everyones first time should be snot IMO, no pain no gain.&nbsp; But thats why i started doing extractions man, im gettin old, not as rock n roll as i used to be.. lmao

				even with extractions (san pedro) i have gotten nausea every time which i normally hate...&nbsp; but after purging from mescaline my system feels more clean and immediately afterward i get the first intense rush of psychedelia and euphoria. though if you do it too soon you wont absorb enough of the mescaline for a decent experience
