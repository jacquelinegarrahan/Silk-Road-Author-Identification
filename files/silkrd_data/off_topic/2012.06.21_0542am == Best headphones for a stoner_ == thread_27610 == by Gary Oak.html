				Alright cool cats, so I&#039;m jammin&#039; out and getting groovy to some tunes on the comedown of some MXE and Cherry Pie when I had an idea. I want some primo headphones to have a blast with while I&#039;m getting funky with the stars, can you dig it? I want some far out ear-teasers that induce orgasms while I&#039;m getting hip with Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison on my LSD! So what&#039;s the word brothers? ^-^

				If you&#039;re on a budget, get Audio Technica M-50&#039;s - shud be $150 or under<br />If you&#039;re not on a budget, get more expensive Audio Technica cans<br /><br />I&#039;ve bought quite a few headphones, all of then with quality in mind. I can basically guarantee the M50&#039;s are definitely worth it. Don&#039;t trust me, just look em up, you&#039;ll see the reviews.

				I&#039;m telling you, man, Sony has perfected the headphone experience with the 7506&#039;s.<br /><br />They&#039;ve been the industry standard in music production and live radio since the 80&#039;s, and there&#039;s a damn good reason.<br /><br />Seriously, go watch some live radio interviews on Youtube and you&#039;ll see quite a few of the studios stocked with these things.

				Hi,<br />If you want accurate answers you should be more precise about your budget and maybe the kind of headphones you are looking for. What is your set up for listening to music ? Personally I won&#039;t buy the same headphones for my high end hifi set up or for my iPhone. There are hundreds of models at very different prices for different uses. <br /><br />This said a very good compromise is the Sennheiser HD 25 : professional quality, solid construction, it will work in any kind of environments. And I love the design ! <br />As said above the AT M50 is very good choice too, but it depends your personal tastes.<br /><br />If you have an unlimited budget and want to live an amazing sound experience you should try Stax electrostatic headphones, it&#039;s really crazy (but prices are a bit crazy too !). <br /><br />WL

I tend to head outside more often than not while on psychedelics so preferably durable as well. Comfort is a must, and let&#039;s say my budget is $300 or less. I&#039;ve never spent more than that for my gaming headsets, but they still provide mind-blowing sound quality!<br /><br />The Sennheiser HD 25 Originals are pretty cool, but might as well let this thread sit for awhile to see what else there is. Thanks everyone, enjoy the karma! ;)

				Gaz, if you&#039;re not looking for production quality, go for anything AKG or Sennheiser, anywhere from $50 to $150. <br /><br />Look for closed-ear-canns and noise cancellation is never wasted!

				Indeed I really enjoy the HD 25, I use it for Dj sets and with my iPhone since I have lost my intras. It&#039;s comfortable, but I guess you can find better for a strictly domestic use. It&#039;s an old model, it was used in British Airways Concorde flights during years : stratospheric headphones ! <br /><br />One problem when you choose headphones is that, contrary other audio devices, it&#039;s not easy to find a shop where you can try the products.<br />WL
