				I recently downloaded a hi-def rip of Prometheus and turned if off a few minutes into the film because I wasn&#039;t in my best mood to enjoy it.<br />It seems to be in similar epic scale(effects-wise) to the film Avatar.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about watching it when my 100 hit Avatar sheet comes in. Will this be a bit too much? or should i go for it.. possibly just a low dose?<br /><br />I searched online and found a post of someone watching it whilst tripping but it contained lots of spoilers which i dont like (I detest anyone telling me anything about a film before i watch it, even just to tell me &quot;you&#039;ll enjoy it&quot; -which creates expectations and deters from said enjoyment)<br /><br />Other than that, i rack my brain for things to do whilst im tripping, i usually end up getting fed up of my cluttered surroundings and decide to &quot;black-bag&quot; anything thats been sitting around un-used for a while.<br /><br />A highlight of my last trip was standing in the rain sampling miniature ripe Alpine strawberrys from my outdoor plants. they were ultra sweet like a mouthful of red skittles as all the clouds morphed around and changed colours.<br /><br /><br />Other than the film, can you think of anything worth doing? I was thinking of getting some different kool-aid flavours and maybe some Miracle berry extract (changes sour/bitter flavours to sweet) MDMA, few bottles of rootbeer and a load of new family guy/simpsons etc episodes.

				I wouldn&#039;t watch anything even remotely scary, dark or violent but that&#039;s just me. As far as sci-fi goes, 2001 would be my cup of tea. Perhaps crack cocaine would make Prometheus enjoyable.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />And yes, cleaning up the place is a must do before any psychedelic trip.

				I appreciate you telling me it sucked ass, valakki. It&#039;s likely to reverse my expectations leading to better enjoyment hopefully. +1<br />I did enough typing of crazy shit during my last trip. I tend to talk bollocks anyway so thats no good, it puts people off me.<br />I&#039;ll make a 3D video diary for half hour or so though, and keep audacity recording the whole thing.<br />-<br />Alien you say? I wanna be impressed not permanently frightened of dark places.. <br />could it be that your enjoyment of films over time has decreased?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=99362.msg698522#msg698522">Quote from: gtgeorgz on January 02, 2013, 08:47 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I&#039;ve always wondered what Inception would be like to watch whilst tripping.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>lol, thats the only film that fucked with my mind to the point where it &#039;hurt&#039; and was unpleasant to think about the dream within a dream concept.. the definition of mindfuck.<br />I&#039;d be happy if a prequel or sequel came out though.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;d like to give some films a good heads up that have been under-rated. Total recall got a crappy score on IMDB for no apparent reason. It was just as good as the original and more.<br />---<br />also a great UK comedian famous for the office which wasnt all that funny, has produced and starred in a movie called: &quot;The invention of lying&quot;.. without giving away any spoilers, a major part of the storyline is set on earth in a time where people didn&#039;t know how to lie. and for typical reasons it didnt go down well with religious groups who mass slated the film and gave poor ratings.<br />-one of the films ive laughed at most in the last few years. at least watch a trailer.<br />---<br />and lastly a spoof horror comedy called Poultrygeist about a haunted KFC joint. the special effects are supposed to be as corny as hell, i laughed at this even more than the last one, been out a few years and still seeding well on bittorrent. people have came back to me and thanked me for this one<br /><br /><br />(i think if you click the rating on IMDB, you can see which different age groups, countries, genders have rated. but rottentomatoes is a better site sometimes)

				All I&#039;ll say is that Prometheus turns darker the longer you watch it... first little bit is all happy sifi but by the end it goes all Aliens on your ass. Personally I have a hard time tripping while a dark movie whispers in hidef &quot;YOU ARE GOING TO DIE&quot; in my ear for 2 hours but I know some people enjoy it.<br /><br />Not that you asked for it but if you have the 2010 version Alice in Wonderland handy... oh the colors, the wonderful colors.

				I find I can watch just about anything on acid and have watched even gory horror films and stuff like that, so if you think you&#039;d be into the movie when you&#039;re sober give it a shot on acid and you might like it even more albeit in a different way.&nbsp; Some movies and genres are more enjoyable than others though for sure, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend horror movies although it does make for a different type of trip/mood which can be interesting in its own right.&nbsp; Some of my favorite things to watch on LSD are really bad 80&#039;s and 70&#039;s dubbed kung fu and B movies, especially stuff directed by Godfrey Ho or movies like the American Ninja series.&nbsp; Oh and the Room from 2003 starring, directed, written and produced by Tommy Wiseau.&nbsp; If I watch those type of movies on acid I&#039;ll laugh my ass off so much it feels like I might die, but it&#039;s fun as hell and makes for a great time.&nbsp; Acid makes anything visually trippy so the movie doesn&#039;t need to have high budget effects to be entertaining during a trip, in fact I find the lower budget older stuff strangely more endearing while tripping.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen Prometheus but I agree with the dude who recommended watching 2001 : A Space Odyssey while tripping.&nbsp; I saw that once during a trip and had an awesome time, it didn&#039;t even feel like a long movie when tripping and I found all kinds of weird levels of meaning in there that I never really thought about otherwise.&nbsp; It actually felt like a deep experience although of course I&#039;d seen the movie before that.&nbsp; I think at the time we also put on some music by Giorgio Moroder and it went surprisingly well with it, but maybe we were just tripping really hard.&nbsp; I remember how we thought we were geniuses for discovering how well it synced.&nbsp; Blade Runner is another good one imo, once watched the first half hour or so during a trip but it freaked out or bummed out my friend for some reason so we turned it off.<br /><br />I like to put on blacklights, blacklight posters and things that glow under blacklights when I&#039;m about to trip if we&#039;re at my place, and I own stuff like lava lamps and psychedelic rugs that I will decorate my place with for a trip.&nbsp; Any musical instrument can be pretty cool to play with, I have some analog synths I sometimes really like to play with when tripping.&nbsp; Also, jello is fun to play with and handle while tripping, I like to make a batch beforehand and I also find it a tasty form of nutrition during the trip itself, so maybe buy some nice colors of jello.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s weird for an adult to eat jello but don&#039;t knock it til you&#039;ve tried it on acid.<br /><br />Being outside listening to music and walking around is great especially during good weather and if you have interesting surroundings nearby or even a half decent park or forest.&nbsp; I have friends though who say they get uncomfortable around other people if they&#039;re out in a public place on acid, but I don&#039;t have that problem, it could be because I&#039;ve taken it so many times I can handle it somewhat or at least know what to expect from it.&nbsp; My favorite way of tripping is to take some friends, weed and a music player to a trippy quiet nature spot on a nice day, and then spend a few hours listening to music outdoors before you go do whatever later on.

				Ah I see you brought up Poultrygeist, great movie to watch on lsd if you&#039;re not squeamish.&nbsp; A lot of Troma movies are actually really good for watching on lsd if you&#039;re into weird sick yet funny movies, like the Toxic Avenger series, Class of Nukem High and others.&nbsp; I think Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were pretty cool too.&nbsp; Another one where I almost died laughing was Troll 2, that movie on acid is almost too much, especially that line &quot;Oh My GOD!!!&quot;&nbsp; Man, when I start to really think about it I&#039;ve seen a lot of movies while on lsd...

				Trying to watch a movie on acid let alone any psychedelic is hard, you get lost in your thoughts and forget the movie is even on, the only movie ive ever actually finished was Bambi on 2C-E and i think that was just because of the nostalgia and because its a simple movie.

				Yeah, I don&#039;t know about Prometheus. When I&#039;m on LSD I need happy things surrounding me and anything remotely dark or scary or upsetting can really throw my whole trip off. I recommend a light comedy like maybe Elf or maybe a Disney/Pixar movie. Keep it light and happy.

				This isn&#039;t constructive at all, but hey...off topic is off topic for a reason isn&#039;t it? My friends and I started playing a game called fruit baseball which is amazing whilst tripping. It really just involves eating fruits and then hitting them with baseball bats. They&#039;re so colorful and juicy and, sure, it can be sad watching a delicious fruit go to waste, but there&#039;s no way to be not happy after you hear the ping of your aluminum baseball bat against the hard shell of a watermelon and the rain of the juice splattering in all directions. Surprisingly enough, potatoes are great too (and cheap). Make sure to eat some too. Everybody I know loves fruit when tripping. And my two cents on the movie deal: do something creative whilst tripping. Be productive. We&#039;re blessed with this beautiful drug that can open tons of doors for a person. The way I see it, you should aim for something more cathartic than a dull movie. Or just do whatever you want.

The music/surprises in that movie make it such a thrill. We had to do it in 15-20 minutes chunks though because we needed so many smoking breaks. Also helped contribute to my first/only out of body experience whilst tripping. But scary movies can be fun if you&#039;re with friends. It&#039;s all in your mind bro! You can do it!&nbsp; 8)

				The first time I tripped I watched Bladerunner. Good movie, but TV &amp; LSD don&#039;t go together (IMHO). Everything looks so COOL except the TV, which was so normal it was a real turn off.<br />Prometheus wasn&#039;t as good as it seemed, but Inception was cool; smoke some Salvia &amp; you too can actually live Inception for a few munutes - the visual effects are a lot alike, I think.<br />Damn I ramble a lot - I like to mess with plants whilst tripping - they curl around you &amp; are alive, and (generally) do not make much noise or talk too much...<br />&nbsp;8)
