				So I made my first order from SR the other day. I haven&#039;t smoked in ages and was looking for just a bit to have a relaxing night with a mate. The day when I was expecting it I came home from work and turned into the car park/entrance way for the collection of buildings I live in and saw a couple of cop cars - my heart skips a beat but there&#039;s about 8 buildings in this place with about 16 flats in each, so rationality kicks in and I&#039;m fine. Then I turn the corner to my building and there&#039;s like another 4 cop cars there. I start shitting myself at this point, rationality be damned, but what am I going to do, run away and never come home over a rather small amount of hash? At the entrance to my building there 3 cops and 1 forensic looking guy. I go up to them and ask if it&#039;s alright to come in - they ask what flat I&#039;m in. I tell them and they say...that that&#039;s fine, they&#039;re dealing with something upstairs on the other side of the building. So I feel a huge wave of relief but hopefully keep it from showing on my face and say thanks and walk by. <br /><br />I then remember that the delivery is probably in my post box, which is just behind one of the cops, so I turn around and say &quot;Excuse me, can I just check my mail?&quot; He says sure and moves, I retrieve the goods and get back to my flat and try to relax for a while to stop my heart feeling like I&#039;ve just ran a marathon, wishing I could smoke the stuff to chill but knowing the police are almost right outside and probably wouldn&#039;t let that go<br /><br />tl;dr - thought I was busted, I wasn&#039;t.

				They wouldn&#039;t be out in the open like that if they had a problem with you, but I know the feeling&nbsp; :-X Walking past 5 cops candy flipping, exhilarating ;) <br /><br />From what I remember USPS has to do a controlled delivery. (Anyone who uses fedex/ups aint worth buying from.) If they believe it may hold illegal contraband its put in a different pile, certain things flag this. Anything but USPS can be open freely, but they get a warrant based on probable cause, then replace whatever substance is in the package with 97% filler. They have someone deliver the package, then they wait 20-30(Sometimes longer) minutes before raiding to make sure you have opened the package. Also if you leave with the package you are stopped. Let me see if I can find the profiling guide from the feds.<br /><br />All I know is if I didn&#039;t sign up for confirmed sig delivery, I ready plan B. If anyone has anything to fill in, please do :)

				This happened a long time ago, about a year after the attacks: <br /><br />I was a really stupid pothead who couldn&#039;t survive a day without a toke. So when I had to travel for a few days I figured in all my stoner wisdom that I would bring a couple of joints with me. I wrapped two medium-sized in saran wrap, sprayed it with Fantastic, then wrapped it again, sprayed, then a third wrap. <br /><br />Right before I got to the airport, I put the whole thing in my underwear right under my balls, made sure there were no dogs around, double-checked that I had no metallic things on me, and hoped for the best as I crossed the checkpoint. Sure enough, I was singled out for a pat down. I stepped over to the area, lifted my arms, spread my legs, and prayed. <br /><br />As the TSA dude was patting me down, I COULD FEEL THE GODDAMNED THING FALLING OUT OF MY UNDERWEAR AND DOWN MY PANTS! The balled-up joints finally dropped all the way onto the floor just&nbsp; when the dude decided that I was all clear!&nbsp; In that moment of horror, my (hare) brain just went into auto-pilot and instead of just walking the hell away, I ended kicking the whole thing around for about 20 feet to the closest bathroom, where I finally picked it up and had the piss of my life.<br /><br />To this day, I have no idea how the officer didn&#039;t notice it.&nbsp; I count that experience as God giving me a break on one of my stupidest decisions. I have never flown with drugs on me since.

				Apparently the police were there because a guy died from a drugs overdose, which is ironic<br /><br />I thought this building was a bit nicer than that...
