				I notice pills are often described as &quot;crushable.&quot; <br />Does this mean you can IV them and they won&#039;t gel and/or aren&#039;t waxy?<br />Or does it&nbsp; just mean you can turn them to powder? Cause I have run into some pills that you literally can&#039;t crush them, and others if you do they&nbsp; just squish into a disc.

				The short answer is that they&#039;re snort-able/ IV-able Thanks to the law suit against Purdue Pharma and other companies, pharmas are now adding chemicals that make snorting or iving difficult if not impossible.

				you are correct it means they can be crushed easily to powder - however this does not necessarily mean they wont gel when snorted or cooked up

Drugs are most likely crushable and can use either snorting or IV, and by drugs i mean _drugs_ not medicine or prescription drugs. Even tho, there are some prescription drugs which you can crush, snort and IV, with some of them its highly recommended, like Subutex and oxycodone.

				Assume crushable means they are safe to sniff not IV.<br />You crush a hydromorphone you can sniff it but you try to iv it and you better filter it 6 times.<br />The 8mg triangle &quot;Diluadid&quot; is the safest to iv and easiest to prep.<br /><br />:)<br />nomad bloodbath
