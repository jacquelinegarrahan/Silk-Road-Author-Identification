				Okay experienced psychonauts. I have 98 bitcoins to spend (hooray tax returns!) and I need to know what to spend it on. I already have weed and shrooms, and I&#039;ll probably want to buy some MXE. I&#039;ve tried 2c-b and it was okay, but I don&#039;t see myself buying it again. I love the dissociatives, opiates scare me, but they can be quite fun on occasion. What do you guys recommend I try?

				Considering you&#039;ve done 2c-b (which is partly a stimulant) I&#039;d say Mephedrone would be a good for a nice euphoric high&nbsp; :). <br /><br />Also 2c-b has similar effects to acid (obviously it&#039;s unique as well) So try some acid if you want the real thing =) If you can handle Shrooms you can handle acid as well<br /><br />Remember, right setting for all the drugs you take... Stops the paranoia. Also makes the effects better - good setting - and good mood (The euphoria from acid doesn&#039;t come that often, but when it hits you it shits all over MDMA and Drone.

				Well, it really depends on what you are looking for.<br /><br />Will you be doing this at home with your special someone? or at a party? With only yourself? Do you want to feel like the king of the world or do you want to feel that you are not in this world anymore? :)<br /><br />Personally i would recommend LSD for mind altering and horizon expanding. It is a must try drug for everyone imo. Just make shure you prepare for it in advance. If you want party or fooling around with your partner I would take Extacy.<br /><br />If you want to leave this world for a short period I would smoke Salvia. it only takes about 1,5 minutes, but that is more than enough and it will give you food for you toughts for a long time.<br />

				DMT.<br /><br />Seriously, LSD and shrooms are little bitch drugs compared to DMT (I love acid and shrooming as much as the next guy so hold it)<br /><br />With acid and shrooms you&#039;re still in this reality, albeit distorted with visuals and profound states.. but DMT is a whole other REALM. You&#039;ve got to try it. And even if you have a bad trip, its over in 5 minutes, and like with all the bad trips I&#039;ve ever had, it turns out fine in the end.

				I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m looking for exactly. Just something new and unique. I wanted to try DIPT, but there&#039;s no offerings of it on SR. LSD I&#039;d love to try, but I live with other people right now and they&#039;re fairly likely to try to talk to me about something if I stay in my room. So due to the length of time LSD is in your system for, I find it unlikely that I&#039;d have a chance to use it before I move. I could try it at my friend&#039;s place, but we usually do shrooms or smoke pot as he seems to have a thing against &quot;chemicals&quot; (like mushrooms and pot are composed of quarks and gluons). I&#039;ll consider buying LSD when I live with just one or no other people. Not much of a party goer, but with a friend might still work, so long as the effects don&#039;t last more than 6 hours. <br /><br />&quot;Considering you&#039;ve done 2c-b (which is partly a stimulant) I&#039;d say Mephedrone would be a good for a nice euphoric high&quot;<br />But I&#039;m not a big fan of 2c-b. It&#039;s alright, but it&#039;s not terribly interesting. I really like how visual it is as I rarely get visuals on shrooms (it doesn&#039;t seem to matter what my dose is). Still, I&#039;d like something more visual. I got crazy auditory hallucinations on PCP which actually wasn&#039;t that fun because they were largely annoying and disorienting.<br /><br />DMT I will consider looking into. Should I get 5-MeO-DMT or regular DMT? I really want to try ayahuasca, but I&#039;d prefer to take it in a jungle setting with natives. But maybe I&#039;m not being realistic as who knows if I&#039;ll ever get the chance to do so.

				I should clarify. I&#039;ve had opiates before, including fentanyl, codeine and vicodin, But they were all prescribed. What I&#039;m really nervous about is the idea of seeking out opiates in the fear that it might become too regular a thing.

				Maybe try try to snort some H to get a feel for it? Obviously you won&#039;t get the rush you constantly hear about... But I&#039;ve heard its still quite nice :) And it should be easier to resist temptation to use everyday

				what about the other 2c-...s? Are they significantly different or if I don&#039;t like 2c-b I basically won&#039;t particularly enjoy 2c-i or 2c-p? How do they differ? Because basically I don&#039;t particularly enjoy the XTC feeling.That hyped up, sweaty, serotonin-feeling.
