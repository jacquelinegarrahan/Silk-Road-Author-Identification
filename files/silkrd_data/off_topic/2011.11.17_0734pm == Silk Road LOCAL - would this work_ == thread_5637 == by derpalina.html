				Last night I was hanging out with a friend and was like &quot;derp, yeah I just ordered some drugs online&quot; -- obviously he wanted to know HOW, but trying to explain TOR/Bitcoin/MtGox/Silk Road/GPG to a stoner is... difficult.<br /><br />Introducing Silk Road LOCAL:<br /><br />1) Customer sends email to chicagoweed@tormail.net - &quot;I need an eighth&quot;<br />2) Customer gets response &quot;Deposit $50 at Wall Fargo into account GetBitcoin LLC / 123456789 then email me the receipt&quot;<br />3) A couple hours after customer emails the deposit receipt they get a reply &quot;Your dank has been delivered under the bench at the corner of 5th &amp; Acorn&quot;<br /><br />What are problems with this? Obviously you would need a local distributor, but I think the two main innovations:<br />1) not requiring customers to use TOR - it seems like a fake yahoo email sent from the local coffee shop is a sufficient substitute for TOR-- the paranoid could always use tormail as well.<br />2) dead-drop delivery. the consumer would have to put a certain level of trust in the supplier since they have to make a pickup.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Seems like it&#039;d be a bad idea. How easy would it be for LE to setup a sting with a fake bank account or wait to pick you up at the drop off? At least with mail shipments, you can deny ever ordering anything. But, if you&#039;re at a bank caught on camera making a deposit into that fake account, I think it&#039;ll be hard to refute your intentions. SR is meant to keep anonymous and making local deals kind of defeats the purpose IMO.<br /><br />EDIT: I probably misunderstood about the bank account thing, assuming that it was the seller&#039;s. But, even if it wasn&#039;t, it&#039;s still not a great idea emailing a timestamped deposit receipt to LE.
