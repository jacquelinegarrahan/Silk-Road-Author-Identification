				what kind of price are &quot;middies&quot; where you are from?<br /><br />if you&#039;re talking about brick weed, mexican style, there&#039;s no margin in it.&nbsp; And it&#039;s absolute shit.

				Exactly, that shit weed is only good for those winter vacations at a ski lodge. Throw it in the fireplace and close the flue. Then everybody gets high by asphyxiation. <br /><br />Good times though. Turned into a Roman style orgy. Mmmmmm.<br /><br />But it&#039;s still shit bud.&nbsp; ;D

				There&#039;s a few vendors here and there that were offering brick weed at fairly cheap prices. From the pictures they provided it was your run of the mill brick weed, &#039;middies&#039; in my area refers to this, so I&#039;m supposing you&#039;re talking about brick/reggies/middies/dirt. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know why anyone would willingly smoke middies when SR has a wide variety of dank for decent prices. Outdoor bud would substantially be a better smoking experience than &#039;middies. I might be wrong, but I remember seeing anarcho having outdoor, and I think meganug had outdoor listings of 28 and 56 grams for very reasonable prices.

				And yes, I do offer very nice outdoor and secondary lower-plant cuts off of hydro-grows for around the $200 mark per oz, on a regular basis.<br /><br />But I&#039;ve got something bigger in the works where I&#039;m hoping to be offering something a lot nicer for $200 that will beat the tar out of anything you will ever see on the Road at that price.&nbsp; It&#039;s taking longer than I&#039;d hoped but I&#039;m getting there.

				I know the answer!! Because middies SUCK!!! That&#039;s why. No one wants to waste there time and money to bring CRAP to the community. At least I hope not. We need more quality smoke and other high quality products.&nbsp; <br /><br />I smoke from everything. Vaporizers&nbsp; ;D,&nbsp; glassware&nbsp; &nbsp;:D,&nbsp; joints/blunts&nbsp; ;D It&#039;s all dro. I do not understand when given a choice choosing mids.

				I for one would like to see middies on Silk Road as well, but certainly not if its going to be compressed mexi-schwag. <br /><br />Marijuana is supposedly the top cash crop in 12 states (TN, NC, SC, KY, ETC). Not all of this stuff is the diggity dank worthy of $60+ eigths. I&#039;d love to see some of this stuff up on the road. For me its a much better bang for my hard earned dollar when I can get $120 ozs of weed that smokes good, smells good, is mostly seedless, and still gets me as high as I want than spending the outrageous amounts that the dank commands on the Silk Road. <br /><br />Anarcho, you may have some great deals, but my days of ordering cannabis from outside the U.S. have long been over. <br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/566d401298<br /><br />That looks like something I&#039;d call mids. If its been pressed into a brick it doesn&#039;t really qualify for the term mids in my opinion, but there are different degrees of compression I suppose. That stuff looks like it may have been bricked, but not so much to destroy any semblance of buddage.&nbsp;

				in my experience, &quot;mids&quot; or &quot;middies&quot; is different than &quot;schwag&quot;/&quot;regular weed&quot;/&quot;regs&quot;/&quot;brick.&quot;&nbsp; The latter being compressed, very dark, and quite seedy usually; the former being uncompressed, usually light green, and with minimal seed quantity.&nbsp; before coming to silk road I used to buy an ounce of mids for 140 USD, and it was pretty good smoke.&nbsp; I like the good stuff, but I&#039;m not a rich man or a weed snob and I need to medicate every day.<br /><br />the prices on dank weed are fucking absurd.&nbsp; I really can&#039;t understand you guys paying 350 for an ounce or over 100 for a quarter....thats just a deep gouge, IMO.&nbsp; &nbsp;outdoor weed is where its at; use the extra money to buy concentrates.
