				I recently went on a trip to Europe, and spent a few days in Amsterdam. First off, I am not slamming Amsterdam at all - I loved the city and definitely will be returning. However, I was not that ultra impressed with the quality of the weed at coffeeshops. Although the whole legal smoking thing is such a crazy experience for an American.<br /><br />Everyone in the US are always JIZZING about amsterdam, how &#039;the weed must be amazing there, I gotta go there, bla blah blah&#039;.<br /><br />But honestly, the &#039;top shelf&#039; stuff I saw (which was fucking expensive, like 13 euro a gram) was not even as good as what I have seen come out of the west coast. In fact, some of the bud that the coffee shop owners showed us to try and impress was just marginal. - not bad by any means, but not that good.<br /><br />Did I just not know where to look? Or am I correct in saying the the west coast of US has far better bud than anything in Amsterdam?<br /><br />This is a pointless thread but I am just fucking bored on a sunday and seeing if anyone else feels the same

				One time I grabbed a few pre-rolled and settled in for the evening. mj was the appetizer with shrooms for the main course - shroom tea, shrooms to munch on. So I&#039;m diving in and having a pretty good time when things go all pear-shaped. There&#039;s this stabbing sensation of pain hitting my temple, and I&#039;m getting strobe-like visual flashes of a background pattern like wallpaper, intensely bright, and I&#039;m all like WHAT THE FUUU--- Something is seriously off. Then it hits me. It&#039;s the goddamn nicotine, ugh. Extremely unpleasant. I wasn&#039;t a smoker, so it hit me painfully hard.

				damn sounds awful! especially while on shrooms, ugh sounds like a terrible experience.<br /><br />on the other hand, shrooms there are cheap as fuck. we walked into a headshop, inquired about them, he simply took us into his basement and sold us like 25 grams for 20 euro.<br /><br />we asked him &#039;didn&#039;t shrooms recently become illegal here?&#039; he just replied &#039;yea. but who gives a fuck&#039;? lol great city

				I have to agree with the statement that Amsterdam weed is overhyped. Most likely this is due to the fact that many tourists smoke their first join here and well, the first one is one you always remember :) For the connoisseur though most weed will be overpriced (tourist prices) and not great stuff unless you buy the most expensive top shelf bud (I have seen prices of 35 euro a gram for rare strains which is ridiculous).<br /><br />Outside of the dam there are much nicer deals. Avoid tourist places and you will get to smoke great bud for a good price!

I was so sad when I heard about the shroom prohibition (which seems crazy to me - I get that most people associate Amsterdam with mj - or prostitutes - but for me it&#039;s shrooms all the way). And killer price, too. <br /><br />There is something to be said for the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; atmosphere - or atmospheres, take your pick. I like it, and wish the gov there liked it too instead of being ashamed of it and trying to restrict the business however possible. That said, it&#039;s probably not always fun being the drug tourist destination of choice for loud mouthed frat boy troublemakers. Amsterdam is also a lovely town in its own right if you check out other sides of it (the art galleries - holy shitballs). Shame about the food.

				oh yea, the coffeeshop atmosphere is very amazing and a completely unique, awesome experience<br /><br />however as an American I was differently treated poorly at some and given looks by locals who were there, I could already tell that as a country we have made a bad impression on them due to as you say &#039;loud mouthed frat boys&#039; haha

				The Dutch have the impression (and rightfully so) that American (and British) tourists smoke to get completely wrecked. The locals smoke to get buzzed, and they mix tobacco in the joints to keep it mild. If you want pre rolled without tobacco, ask. Better yet, buy weed that you can inspect first and roll your own. Regarding the quality of the pot, I would agree that most is disappointing, but the good stuff can be found if you go to the right places. Tourist places like the Bulldog or the Grasshopper are not where you want to go, try the Grey Area, Abraxas, De Dampkring, Tweede Kamer, De Kuil (aka cafe 420), and countless others. Of course if the weed becomes tiresome, you can just buy the hash instead.<br />As others have stated, the unique experience of exploring a beautiful, historic European city like Amsterdam is something that you will never forget. And being able to pop into a coffeeshop for a smoke and a beer while doing so, priceless!

				California has the best weed in the world.&nbsp; (EDIT: I should have said INVENTS the best.&nbsp; Anyone can grow it of course as Jack N Hoff pointed out)<br /><br />Amsterdam doesn&#039;t even come close.<br /><br />Here is an article I found pretty interesting from the harborside health center (currently the biggest weed shop in the world) that discusses some of the revolutions in the Cali MJ industry in the past 10 years or so.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Beginning in the 1960s with the legendary Panama Red, and continuing through the &#039;70s and &#039;80s with Thai Sticks, Colombian Gold, Afghani Hashish and California Sinsimillia, there are trends in cannabis buying just as in other forms of commerce. The 1990s brought strain-specific cannabis like Skunk #1 and White Widow from Holland. These strains had originally come from the U.S. to Holland in the 1980s, where the climate for cannabis breeding was much more relaxed. The Dutch strains were the beginning of the modern cannabis market as we know it. When voters passed Prop 215 in 1996 and the first dispensaries opened in San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland, choices were somewhat limited to White Widow, Blue Dot, Northern Lights and a small variety of unknown strains. Sixteen years later, the variety of cannabis available now boggles the mind.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />White Widow was one of the early popular strains. Whether this was due to its ubiquitous availability or its powerful uplifting effects is hard to say. The Widow fad lasted from the late &#039;90s to the early part of the 21st century. The next trend was Trainwreck, which hit the medical scene just like a train wreck in about 2003. Medical patients and dispensaries couldn&#039;t get enough Trainwreck to supply the demand. Everybody wanted the &quot;wreck.&quot; Growers all over the Bay and state started growing this sought-after strain to supply the demand. Within a relatively short time the amount of Trainwreck available exceeded the demand. The medical cannabis industry had seen its first of many boom/bust cycles involving a specific strain.<br />&nbsp;<br />The next wave was a monster. Who ever knew that cannabis could be purple? The Purps-specifically, Grand Daddy-slammed into the Bay like a tsunami. The year 2003 brought Grand Daddy Purple, a.k.a. GDP, to the medical cannabis industry looking for something different. Within a short time there were hip-hop artists name-checking GDP. This led to a massive explosion in popularity. The demand for Purple in 2004-2005 so far exceeded the supply that dispensaries would pay up to $5000 per pound for the coveted flowers. By the time Harborside Health Center opened in 2006, GDP, Purple Erkle, Purple Kush and just about anything Purple ruled the East Bay like a kindly and well-medicated king. In Oakland and certainly at Harborside Heath Center, GDP continues its position of prominence nearly six years in. Many of our patients find continued effective relief from a variety of conditions from these noble, Purple strains.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />One of the goals set from the beginning of Harborside Health Center was to diversify the genetic pool. Our clone department worked tirelessly to bring new and original landrace strains to patients; the sheer diversity of our selection is a testament to the success of this work. What subsequent strain would dominate? This time the next wave would roll in from an unlikely place-Los Angeles.<br />&nbsp;<br />Beginning in 2006 people started talking about this strain from the South. OG Kush was the name and it rolled in like a rogue wave. The clones were so rare then, they fetched very high prices. Was the herb really that good? Well, yes! OG, as anyone who smokes it knows, is powerful medicine. Harborside Health Center began to see little bits in 2007. Most of the OG grown in the Bay at the time sold for inflated sums per pound. Eventually, as more clones got around, prices dropped and it became more readily available. We worked hard to convince vendors to bring their OG to Harborside so patients in the North could experience the sour Pine-Sol funk of this extraordinary strain. OG has also shown staying power similar to GDP; these two strains continue to be top choices at Harborside Health Center.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The latest fad-after we&#039;ve passed through Sour Diesel and Blue Dream, both of which remain popular but not titanic-is the &quot;Cookies.&quot; This strain is a cross of Cherry Pie Kush (OG Kush x Purple Kush x Durban Poison) and OG Kush. Patients drive many miles to any dispensaries fortunate enough to have this strain, which has gained popularity in the last year. It took a short while but in the last few months Harborside Health Center has seen a steady supply. Not daily, but usually weekly, you will see the Cookies on our menu.<br />&nbsp;<br />What&#039;s next? Who knows! That&#039;s one of the wonderful aspects of working in the medical cannabis industry. The passion and dedication of the breeders and growers is limitless, as is the amazing variety this incredible plant can express.

				I have not been to Amsterdam for 2 years- things may have changed even more so than I&#039;ve seen in the last 5. However, there is still plenty of good weed&nbsp; there, and as someone else mentioned, the fact that you can smoke in public, commonly, etc.... Waking up, rolling a j laced w/ hash, eating space cake &amp; drinking cappuccino...in a beautiful, quaint city no less, is a great experience. the windows, legal truffles, and night life scene also help paint the picture of paradise for people on these forums... <br /><br />Anyway, here is my personal list of the best coffee shops. it&#039;s easy to stumble upon a tourist coffee shop and get a disgusting(imo), weak, spliff. <br /><br />Paradox<br />The Grey Area *<br />Old Church COffee Shop<br />Katsu<br />Abraxas<br />de kuil<br />Tweede Kamer<br />Amnesia<br />Dampkring<br />free i<br />kadinsky<br /><br /><br />I hope I can travel back before Amsterdam is tarnished for good<br />

				Europe in general doesn&#039;t have the genetics that American and Canada do. America is the king of creating strains at the moment and all the crazy cross straining is happening there.

				I think its overhyped aswell.

The big seed breeders rent land from farmers in Chaouen, Morocco where the laws are laxed and the climate is perfect.

				No i reckon it is not over hyped. Sure there are some tourist orientated shops that are but there are some great places with great bud and prices. <br />the way i always explain it to people that have never been is this. <br />It&#039;s not some magical land where Bud is somehow better, bud can be grown anywhere , what would make it better just because it was grown in amsterdam? It&#039;s the fact that because of the leniency etc they grow it well, dry it well and cure it even better. The result is an amazing smoke. They cure it for 2 weeks minimum after it has been dried for the same period beforehand. <br /><br />The bud really is good if you go to the right places. next time i go im defo stealth packaging myself a good few g&#039;s home.

				North America does have a very good reputation for growing and breeding.<br /><br />I do think there is excellent bud to be found in Europe/UK though. In general in the UK I think we&#039;re less interested in new strains and pushing the boundaries of breeding. I know plenty of dealers who don&#039;t bother to mention strain names when they&#039;re selling. They probably do know what strain they&#039;re selling (though maybe not sometimes) - it just isn&#039;t necessarily information they feel they need to pass on to the majority of their customers, most of whom just call it &#039;skunk&#039; and don&#039;t really care beyond that.<br /><br />I wonder if this is because we have a long tradition of importing hashish, where strain is irrelevant. Some of the best smoke in Europe isn&#039;t bud/weed at all - it&#039;s traditional hash and it comes to us from all over the Middle East and Asia. <br /><br />I don&#039;t say this to offend anyone - I know bud is good etc etc - but in my circle of friends at least really strong buds are seen as a bit of a kid&#039;s smoke. Hash is generally preferred, though there&#039;s definitely some crap hash around too like soap bar, and then lots of commercial grade from Morocco which is OK but not that great. <br /><br />In my opinion a good charas from the Himalayas beats any bud in the world for flavour and character though!

In fact, some of the bud that the coffee shop owners showed us to try and impress was just marginal. - not bad by any means, but not that good.<br /><br />Did I just not know where to look?

It&#039;s like any other retail service, quality is highly variable.<br /><br />The Grey Area typically stocks with Cannabis Cup winners, along with their own strains (Americans own it). There are a few other places throughout Amsterdam that are top notch. You get to know the city, and the decent coffee shops. I can&#039;t remember all the places I went, but only a hand full out of the 20-30 coffee shops I visited were superb.<br /><br />Overall, the love Americans have for Amsterdam is the legality over Cannabis and psychedelics. Personally, the history and culture of Amsterdam is breathtaking.<br /><br />Peace.

				While amsterdam was the trailblazer of commercialized weed, it is falling behind due to the limitations place on it for international tourists and their lack of development of new strains.&nbsp; They seem to always go with the classic strains and growing techniques (although they are starting to move along now to catch up).&nbsp; The marijuana boom in the western U.S. has blown weed into a new stratosphere because of the amount of people interested and experimenting with new strains, growing techniques, and the fact that they have millions of critics.&nbsp; Just an opinion, LOVE amsterdam still.&nbsp; It thrives in other categories than weed :)
