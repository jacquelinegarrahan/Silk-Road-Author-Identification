				most psychoactive drugs don&#039;t show up on drug tests. LSD/Shrooms/DMT (as far as I know). but you do need your sleep. DMT is the only one that&#039;s shortest acting. or 2CB too as I think of it. <br /><br />no J for you, that shit shows up forever on drug tests. the five things they test for is amphetamines, meth, cannbis, opiates and cocaine. I don&#039;t know your drug tests but this is the most common. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D have fun with everything else. I wouldn&#039;t recommend benzos to err on the side of caution.&nbsp;

				Pick yourself up some GHB. Also not tested for and you get a nice, alcohol-like feel to it. Or hit some benzos because, fuck, in three weeks you can clean up pretty much anything if you aren&#039;t abusing it regularly. <br /><br />

				GHB ???, what a fucking joke.<br /><br />Anyway, have you heard of Milk Thistle?<br /><br />&#039;Smoke as much as you like, take the thistle night before, or 24hrs before you test.<br /><br />There will be no trace. ;)

				Kratom is a fantastic choice for a readily available substance if you&#039;re into opiate-like drugs.&nbsp; It&#039;s legal in the U.S. and I really enjoy it.&nbsp; You can make it into a tea or just take it straight with water.&nbsp; It has a very relaxing sedative effect.&nbsp; PM me if you want some reliable clearnet sites to check out.&nbsp;
