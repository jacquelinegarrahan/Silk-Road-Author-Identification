				Hello,<br /><br />The DailyPaul, which is my primary source of unfiltered news, is a large and influential hub for (Ron Paul&#039;s campaign) and furthering the Liberty movement here in the US. It&#039;s been around for 6 years and is going through a much needed maintenance and repair sessions. The owner, Michael, has put up a ChipIn for donations to help pay for this, but has also posted a BTC Address.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a few coins left over in my SR wallet that I would like to donate. I don&#039;t have any experience transferring coins off the SR and wondering if I need to send it to a tumble or fog service first. I don&#039;t think he would care much even if he knew where it came from, but just to be on the safe side I&#039;d like to know if possible. <br /><br />If you too would like to donate here is the address to the thread:<br />http://www.dailypaul.com/270457/the-daily-paul-needs-your-help-fundraiser#comments<br /><br />Thanks<br />

Do you think a regular wallet would work as well? Running my desktop one at the moment which is synchronizing to the network (11415 Blocks Remaining oy!)<br /><br />+1 for the donation -- I am normally a tight ass, but that truly is a beacon of light on the internet that I use daily.

				I would at the very least use an instawallet before I send to my local wallet.&nbsp; It does take longer that way but it will obfuscate things.<br /><br />As for the daily paul, thanks!&nbsp; What did you think about Gov. Gary Johnson?&nbsp; I really wanted him to get 5% of the vote.<br /><br />

Looking forward to 2016 and hopefully getting behind Rand Paul (Whom I am still judging with utmost scrutiny as his career continues)
