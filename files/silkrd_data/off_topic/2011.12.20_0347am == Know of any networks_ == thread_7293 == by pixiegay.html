				G&#039;day!&nbsp; &nbsp;:P<br /><br />(Before I start, I&#039;m well aware of I2P and freenet +other mainstream networks)<br /><br />My friend sent me to the tor network to search for this &#039;deep&#039; network that he is apparently apart of and for some reason or another; he won&#039;t simply tell me how to get to it, I even had to do some of my own investigating to get to here!. From a few sources I&#039;ve happened to come across and I was told that silkroad was the place to look for information of these sorts of networks, so here I am...<br /><br />I&#039;m well aware that onion-land is a &#039;deep&#039; hidden network in itself, but it&#039;s very mainstream already and apparently is only the surface of this so called &#039;deep&#039; internet. Do not get me wrong, silkroad and onion-land is great but it doesn&#039;t really have what I&#039;m looking for exactly for the type of business I&#039;m looking at. <br /><br />If know of any of these networks, I&#039;d kindly appreciate any information if you have any or are allowed to share any. Feel free to respond however you wish, PMs would be greatly appreciated! I&#039;m also on torbook, so if you&#039;re on it add pixelguy!<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep this relatively brief and wrap this up! However again, any information you have would be great! See you all around.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />P.S. anyone know where to grab hold of firearms around here? Thanks.

				You&#039;re as deep as it gets, pix.<br /><br />Guns just pop up every now and again.&nbsp; Safest way to ship is via fax, same way as sending LSD blotter &gt;250ug.&nbsp; Although I find the guns, they don&#039;t hold up to excessive use as well.<br /><br />

				Any &quot;type of business&quot; that can&#039;t be done on Silk Road, the motherfucking EBAY OF CONTRABAND, is probably some pretty sick shit.<br /><br />Get outta here.<br /><br />Also, anarcho47, I was just faxed a 9 millimeter by mistake. I want to &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, but I&#039;m afraid to touch the paper this gun is on as I do not know whether or not it was faxed with bullets in the chamber (as I did not order this picture of a gun, I know nothing about how it was shipped).<br /><br />Please advise on how to safely check my piece of paper to see if it is loaded.

				Check the safety first.&nbsp; Then rack the top left corner back (be careful not to tear!)&nbsp; If a shell flies out, it means you had a live one in there.&nbsp; If not, it means you just received a gun by fax.&nbsp; Next, push the middle of the paper and nothing should happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, be sure to store your gun safely (not near liquid, fire, pens, or really anything that can crinkle or tear your gun).&nbsp; Refunds are not available on faxed gus as the resolution quality of the returned product is sub-par and cannot be resold.<br /><br />I do send weed by mail though.&nbsp; Got to get SOMETHING good out of those tax dollars I&#039;m subsidizing a dead industry and corporatist organization structure with...

				Well, I stupidly decided to try it on my own before you replied because I was impatient.<br /><br />Long story short: The gun misfired and now I&#039;ve got a paper cut (with an entry AND exit wound). This is why I hate having these damn things in my possession!!<br /><br />I&#039;ll reply back here if I survive my trip to the hospital.

So did the original onion forum when it was around - I noticed a new ones been up but not been there personally.<br /><br />Look at the hidden wiki as a tremendous starting point - but look at it as purely that - a starting point. Then again, if your friend is already apart of that which you seek then why not just ask for the addresses you want and surely he will provide them? <br /><br />- nh
