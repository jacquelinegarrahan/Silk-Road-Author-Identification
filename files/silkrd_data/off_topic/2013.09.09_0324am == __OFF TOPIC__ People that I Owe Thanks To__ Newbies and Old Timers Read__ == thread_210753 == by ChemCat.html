				Most of you don&#039;t know me.<br />&nbsp;I came to the Silk Road to help alleviate the pain that my late wife endured. <br />In doing so, I&#039;ve come to form some bonds with people...I&#039;ll name them now and Thank them.<br /><br />the Dread Pirate Roberts, scout, Jack N Hoff, astor,&nbsp; BoxofShapes, dandantheicecreamman, RS7.... there are more and you know who you are.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You all, in one form or another have touched my life while my wife was alive as well as after she passed. <br />I know some of you don&#039;t understand when i say that &quot;I Love You&quot; ....My Love knows no bounds...sight unseen...No expectations... I Love You.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Jack, You&#039;ve helped me in ways that you cannot imagine. Thank You, you Have my Love.<br /><br />I really do not know what to say, besides thank you, to all of you that have listened to me and let me cry on your shoulders...I suppose that God, or the Molecule has let me stay here to learn from you all and has allowed me to help some of you.....Tonight, when i spoke to Jack, i was about to give up, However...through prayer and a long talk with the molecule, i&#039;ve come to the conclusion that i can be of better service to myself...you and my wifes Spirit...I am about to lose some land and some other material things due to the fact that i cannot pay my late wifes hospital bills, these things..my wife and myself had built for our Grandchildren...I won&#039;t lose it all, however...some of these things will be taken from my grandchildren after this week....we&#039;ll rebuild...DPR..Thank You for allowing me to be here...scout...thank you for your words and the help that you&#039;ve given me...Jack...thank you for listening to me rant time after time, I love you, my Friend...Boxy, Dan, RS..thank you for allowing me to vent and for your Friendship...i also have to Thank thecrackhead &amp; his thread &quot;The Official Spare Coins Thread&quot; for allowing and enabling me to give back to our Family. I am a Firm believer that Blood is not thicker than water...You All Are my Family...right now i am striving to ensure that my grandchildren are going to have a great start in life...they deserve that..this is going to take some..alot of work on my part....if it wasn&#039;t for those of you that i have mentioned...i would have given up by now...I really don&#039;t know what else to say, but Thank You to those of you that Know and Understand.<br />&nbsp; SS and samesame...even cirrus...Thank You.&nbsp; To be here isn&#039;t just about buying or selling drugs.....being here is about the lives that we all touch in a positive way...I&#039;m to old to turn back now...Quiting is not an option at this point...I&#039;ll say this...I need you All, I&#039;ll also say this..I Love you All...I&#039;m going to Follow my heart &amp; the Spirit within me...<br /><br /><br />I Say this to each of You...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Life is Short, Love the Ones you&#039;re With &amp; never let go...don&#039;t squander what you have...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I Love You All,<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, Peace &amp; Hugs to you All&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ChemCat&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O0

				Chemcat, I&#039;m sorry you have this financial burden to bear after such a tragic loss. Money problems are stressful at the best of times, but after a bereavement it&#039;s a cruel blow. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind my asking, how much is it that you need to keep the land? If we all donate what we can, from a few bucks upwards to maybe even 50 or 100 bucks (all the money that the SR admins confiscate from scammers must amount to tens of thousands) then we could all do a huge push and help you keep it?<br /><br />I don&#039;t like asking for help or money, and I get the sense that you&#039;re the same, but in this case you should in my opinion. <br /><br />Please let the community help...... &lt;3 :D xx

				Mr cat! I am shocked to not see my name in the OP! <br />Just kidding. Chem, Your a great guy, I always enjoy seeing you spread your love around the forums. <br /><br />It is a terrible shame what is happening to you regarding your land, I can only imagine if that happened to me. However maybe you could look at it in a lighter way; Like&nbsp; You cant lose anything else, You can always rebuild like you said, And you may well find nicer land. Many a time I have regretted doing or not doing things and it has turned out that good things happened in the long run that would not have happened if things went down the way I wanted them too. Im sorry I know it seems complicated, But who knows you may well find some lovely land somewhere else a year or two down the line, Some lovely mountains, A river running through it and a dense forest on the outskirts, who knows, the possibilities are endless. <br /><br />I wish you the best of luck old friend and if you do decide to accept donations, I would gladly add to the pot, If not you can always bend my ear, Please feel free.<br /><br />Best Regards and Wishes<br />HeatFireFlame
