				Hi all,<br /><br />wondering if someone has an answer for this. I&#039;ll be flying tomorrow morning, and I&#039;m all set as far as drugs and electronics and fluids goes.<br /><br />My one question is that I have a pack of blu e-cigarettes. It basically looks like a pack of cigs, only there&#039;s a spot inside to charge one battery, a spot for 5 nicotine cartridges and a sport for a battery with a cartridge screw on (the e-cig you&#039;re currently smoking.) If I just throw the pack in my purse, will they confiscate it? The starter kit cost me almost $60, so I&#039;d rather not lose all of that. <br /><br />Does anyone have any experience with this?

				How much liquid do the botles hold? <br /><br />You might have to put it through the xray itself, or I&#039;d just check it.

				i just talked to my local tsa agent, he said to put i all in a clear bag and show it to them up front and it would be fine. the tsa website itself says :<br /><br />&quot;Search Results For:<br />electronic cigarettes<br /><br />Check or Carry-on<br />You may transport this item in carry-on baggage or in checked baggage. For items you wish to carry-on, you should check with the airline to ensure that the item will fit in the overhead bin or underneath the seat of the airplane.<br />Please be sure to wrap cords tightly around electronics items and pack your bag in neat layers (layer of clothes, layer of electronics, layer of clothes, layer of shoes, etc.) to help officers get a clear look at your bag.<br /><br />Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.&quot;

				Whenever I travel with weed, I break it up and stick it in with loose leaf green tea. A big bag of it. It&#039;s easy to pick out once you get to your destination, and it&#039;s pretty damn well hidden. You can&#039;t smell it through the green tea either.

Think it&#039;ll work?<br /><br />Seems like the only way it could go wrong is if they open up your pen. Then they&#039;ll be able to smell it... I don&#039;t think they do that, but&nbsp; I&#039;m a little nervous to try it. The TSA scares the shit out of me.<br /><br />Anyone tried it?

				it&#039;s literally just a pack of e-cig cartridges and the battery, which is the end that you smoke out of. The TSA officer I called said just to take it all out to show them and it would be fine,
