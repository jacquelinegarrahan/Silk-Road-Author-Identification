				I got an order thats in escrow with PharmerJohn who pretty much dissapeared with everyones money who finalized early.&nbsp; Now luckily for me i didnt FE so now my btcs are just sitting in escrow.&nbsp; I finally got to send it to the resolution center but seeing the vender vanished and scammed alot of ppl what will be the likely outcome?<br />I really would like to get a 100% refund, i mean it seems like it would be crazy to refund only 50% in a situation like this. Does anyone know?

				Pj done me right on one of my first orders. Didnt even make me fe. He seemed kinda honest. Maybe he got poppedm who really knows if he scammed? You will get 100% back unless he proves otherwise with a dcn. I wish he didnt go, that tar I got was bomb.

				I&#039;m sure scammers once exposed will see any escrow paid back to those lucky enough to have not finalized.<br /><br />When finalized the funds are made available to the seller who can send the BTC to another address automated I would guess.<br /><br />What happens if a seller just disappears?<br /><br />No names but I ordered a few E&#039;s off a vendor who has not been seen for a week and now has no listings plus missed the sale AFAIK. I&#039;m waiting it out patient and sent the guy a PM offering sympathy if he/she has some woes in real life. But even so there must be a set amount of time that will allow people with money in Escrow to be refunded if a seller does not log on to his or her account for a while. I would not want to see my BTC auto finalized when a vendor is not showing up and goods are not turning up either. I know i can extend the finalise period but do not want to go into dispute and tarnish my 200 BTC or so record with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />I do not think my vendor is a scammer but if they do not log on for a week or two then I hope SR has a policy at least of freezing funds if the feedback indicates people are not getting their goods.<br /><br />Obviously dealing with a dealer you accept there are times they cannot deliver. <br /><br />Escrow makes sense at a time like this. I think I got 11 BTC or so tied up. Not a lot but a night out for sure or night in!
