				I am shy, lacking in motivation, and unable to stay engaged with people in conversation. I feel very distant from people. I have had no friends since the age of 7. This inability to obtain any friends, combined with my mental illness, has pushed me to the point of attempting suicide.&nbsp; I feel like I am the only person that is real. I feel like I am in the Truman Show or something. Everything seems so alien and unreal to me.&nbsp; Even inanimate objects exist to torment me by their unreality. This whole show seems more and more like a farce every moment.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I were to start killing people randomly, I wouldn&#039;t be performing any injustice because they don&#039;t exist outside of my head anyway.

				Check your inbox, psychedelia.<br /><br />But just to say here, you have a community. A real one, with more fellow-feeling than you may realize. (hell, some huge proportion of us are on empathogens) Stick with us.

				well, you are indeed the only person in existence.....but so is everyone else you meet.&nbsp; a paradox, i know, but that is one of the fundamental principles of the universe.<br /><br />i understand what you&#039;re feeling as much as i can through a computer screen.&nbsp; a lot of what you&#039;re saying resonates strongly with a younger me.&nbsp; you just gotta find something in life that you like to keep you going through the storm.&nbsp; for me during my darkest days it was going to raves.<br /><br />best of luck man; it sure as hell ain&#039;t easy getting ur head right.<br /><br />please, though, don&#039;t kill a bunch of people.&nbsp; they&#039;re god too, just like you.

				If the the artificial human world is&nbsp; feeling empty, try reaching for the real &quot;real&quot; world, that is nature with no human modification, the space included, the Moon Valley night lights always feel my chest. Also try get rid of this common notion that you must have hundreds of friends and have sex regularly with lots of women, at the end you just need the one women, the only one that matters, you&#039;ll get to her, be patient.

				just hang in there! that&#039;s what i do.<br />sometimes i feel the same way. <br />maybe you should get off the psychedelics? If i were you i would aim my life towards getting a piece of land that i could live off. Just get away from all the madness. grow your own food get some animals and live your life your own way. <br /><br />or maybe talk with your doctor and tell him: reality is going really fucking far away and you are loosing the grasp. maybe he can hook you up with some good shit.

				If you are going to kill anyone kill those who are deserving of death.....<br /><br />all i can tell you is this....<br />your life is worth so much more....more than all those who are worthy of death....<br />i pray you will live on..struggle through this time....<br />really..people who feel like you do are needed here on this earth.....<br />it is a show...a farce.....<br />but if you take your own life...then thats one true soul less upon this earth...<br />and the devils win....<br />
