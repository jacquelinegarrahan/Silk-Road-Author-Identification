				The market has gone down so much these past few weeks and look like its going to go down even more. I actually lost a decent amount of money now and was going to purchase some of Galindoi&#039;s capsules (50) but I guess I&#039;ll just have to hope it goes up again before I make some purchases.<br /><br />Anyone know a reason for the drop in BTC value? As in did some country outlaw them or make them difficult to obtain recently?<br /><br />Only been really watching the BTC market for a few month now fyi if I sound noobish.

				Maybe someone needed to cash in a hoard of coins.&nbsp; As mentioned already, it fluctuates quite a bit.<br />Maybe put them into Badboy&#039;s savings and earn some interest until it bounces back?

				Perhaps people were trying to game the market by hoarding up some coins, perhaps even hoping to increase the price, but instead his change is negligible, and when he sold out of exasperation he started a run...<br /><br />Sorry. I&#039;m baked as hell on rez hits. Which I&#039;ve been taking for 3 days. Oil leaves the most magical resin, its so thick. I have a shitty glass pipe. thin glass - but this glass means i can heat it from the outside, and vape the fuck out of the inside surfaces.
