				I bought around 180$ worth of bitcoin in advance. And now its worth only 160$. Not only have I lost 20$ but I need to wait for improvements in the conversion rate before I have enough to place the order :/

				Why not make an account at mtgox and try to make that $20 back? Sell all your coins when it hits $2.50 a bitcoin, and then buy them all back when they hit $2.00 a bitcoin. It&#039;s such a violate market, there&#039;s a lot of money to be made if you invested the time and patience.

				Keep yer money in USD until you need to trade fer the BTCs you need. Also, as a previous poster said, BTC is so volitale that a litlle trading can make profit. Just keep an eye on the market.<br /><br />We are the 99 percent that can all of the sudden invest in currency like the one percent on Wall St. I call on an occupy Tradehill and MTGOX!

				I&#039;m actually enjoying the BC Volatility. Wish I would have known about BC&#039;s 6 months ago. I would of have set a few BC&#039;s aside and Shorted with a few Options..now that its Low, I&#039;m buying on Margin. Is it crazy risky? Well yeah...it is Crazy Risky sending several hundred converted dollars to an unknown Vendor? Or having hard-core narcotics sent to your home? Yess..There&#039;s always an Angle on how to turn a buck..Half Full or Half empty?
