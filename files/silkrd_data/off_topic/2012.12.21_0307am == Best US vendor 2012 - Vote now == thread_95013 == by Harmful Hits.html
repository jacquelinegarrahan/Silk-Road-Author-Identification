				I love both hatter and vicodin, but considering I&#039;ve ordered from vic more, I voted for him. He might be a ass (personality-wise) a bit, but he always took care of me and was the first vendor I ever ordered from. Not to say hatter never took care of me, because he definitely did, but I rarely order from him. Haven&#039;t dealt with anyone else on this list so...

				Can we do write in candidates? LuckyLucianno. Allow me to count the ways:<br /><br />1) Best MDMA on the Silk Road hands down. Best MDMA I&#039;ve personally tried PERIOD. I&#039;ve given it to some old time ravers (from the pre-drought era) and they say it surpasses what they did in the 90s.<br />2) Awesome prices. 100g for $2,725 for me including Bitinstant fees, commission, and shipping. <br />3) Generally a stand up guy. On the forums, he forgave someone a loan because they said they were trying to get over a drug addiction. No reason to do that, he just did.<br /><br />But I&#039;ll do some categories:<br /><br />Best MDMA vendor: LuckyLucianno (obviously)<br />Best domestic MDMA vendor: Googleeyed, when it&#039;s in stock. <br />Most helpful vendor: CaptainMal (answered a lot of questions I had about ordering BTC)<br />Best weed vendor: PuffBuddy<br />Best shrooms vendor: Rocker (he also gets my second best vendor vote after LuckyLucianno)<br />Best forum member: Pine (PGP club is awesome, what a great helper)<br />Best administrator: DPR (in a shocking surprise win!)<br />Best new site/forum addition/upgrade: Silk Road book club (I didn&#039;t participate as much as I would have liked, but what a great idea. I had fun sparring with DPR - nothing but respect for him, even when we disagree)<br /><br />Now for the &quot;Worst of 2012&quot; categories<br /><br />Worst scam: Tony76 (I stupidly lost $200 to him. Luckily that was a cheap lesson to learn - never ever ever FE)<br />Worst forum poster: IHateNiggers2 (fuck this guy)<br />Biggest forum annoyance of the year: The countless &quot;OMG SILK ROAD IS DONE&quot; posts<br />Worst vendor: MtlJohn/CanadianLTD [same vendor with multiple accounts] (if you don&#039;t know why he&#039;s the worst vendor, congratulations, you&#039;ve saved yourself a lot of hassle and frustration)

				Rocker sells the best bulk!!. Who else but he to sell $450 QPs of legit Shrooms! I love rocker and know when I order that he will come through like no other. Also Hammertime has been exceptional on the shipping and prices, though he keeps changing them, maybe just pinned on the coin.<br /><br />I dont think LE woke up yet this morning, They still doing their breifing, bet this thread will be gone by the nighttime!

Is it that LE does not have the capability to figure out vendors on thier own and they are waiting in the forums and pouncing on threads like this? Would you say that the unique content contained within this thread would be so valuable that LE would gain insight? I am not trying to be rude or anything but.........honestly? Am I missing something or does it seem crazy to believe that LE would value ANYTHING within this thread. ALL of the things contained within this thread are in MULTIPLE other places within the forum.
