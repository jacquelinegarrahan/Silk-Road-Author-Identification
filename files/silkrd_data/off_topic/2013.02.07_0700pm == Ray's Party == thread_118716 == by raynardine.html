				Hey guys. I figured I&#039;d mention the fact that I&#039;m planning an event.<br /><br />I have made a LOT of preparations for it.<br /><br />Let me know if you think I missed anything critical.<br /><br /><br />The Event:<br /><br />Ray&#039;s Project for Local Unity Generation - Fast Entry System Titration<br /><br />PLUG-FEST for short. ;)<br /><br />What experimental hypotheses I am actually testing are whether certain drug combinations, when balanced in certain ratios and proportions, will induce desire and love at the same time in a subject.<br /><br />The goal of this project is to find a blend and administration system that will induce both intense eroticism and libido AND significant empathy and openness.<br /><br />A secondary goal of this project is to make such a blend highly affordable, so cocaine, meth, and high amounts of mdma are ruled out.<br /><br />Wish me luck!<br /><br />I have over four trip sitters, who all have the numbers for emergency services and family members in my area.<br /><br />I figure I could also use the opportunity to show off my shiny new laboratory and the experiments I&#039;ll be performing. The glassware is very shiny.<br /><br />Anyway, here&#039;s a checklist of things I&#039;ve already obtained, or ordered and have on the way:<br /><br />* Erlenmeyer Flasks<br />* Graduated Cylinders<br />* Graduated Beakers<br />* Plenty of Test Tubes<br />* Test Tube Racks<br />* Milligram and Microgram Scales<br />* Transfer Pipettes<br />* Stirring Rods<br />* Measuring Spoons<br />* Scale Calibration Weights<br />* Bulk Lubricant Powder<br />* High Precision Lubricant Applicator<br />* Selection of Sex Toys<br />* Capsules<br />* Capsule Filler Machine<br />* Funnels<br />* Reagent Kit<br />* Lab Worktable<br />* Lockable Cabinets and Bins<br />* Basic Office Supplies<br />* High Performance Desktop Computers<br />* Bright Worktable Lighting<br />* Subject Test Area<br />* Tripsitters<br /><br />Anything I missed?<br /><br />PS: I&#039;m extremely excited about this! I&#039;ve been studying for this for literally years.

				All right, so I think you and me are on sort of the same quest sometimes. I&#039;m all sorts of in love with my girl but we are lovers... kiss, cuddle, make love, nurture and protect each other. Sometimes I just want to take a drug that opens the flood gate for a more primal experience where we simply fuck like animals... raw, uninhibited, loud, sweaty teenage porn star sexual abandon.<br /><br />Clearly, rule number one is getting some freaking Viagra for me. This falls into the TMI zone but my little buddy likes slow soft giggling tender sex so when I start hammering away at my girl, pulling her hair and slapping her ass I end up in a fight againt time as I try and keep the blood flow where it needs to be.&nbsp; Viagra makes this a non-issue.<br /><br />2CB might be something to play with. A lot of people report that it increases sexual desire. My experiments with it thus far have been sort of hit or miss. If I snort just a little bit when I am jerking off, I can come in seconds. Something about the rush of that drug gets me to the point where my dick thinks I&#039;ve been jerking off for hours. Soft or hard, doesn&#039;t matter, I come fast coming up on a small hit of 2CB. An interesting latent effect is that when I do approach my girl for relations later I tend to get hard pretty fast, turn things frisky quickly and we often end up having some good loving. It&#039;s not reckless abandon loving but intense if that makes sense.<br /><br />Moxy is sort of similar to 2CB in some ways. At lower doses is doesn&#039;t drive me to sex but if I start thinking about sex it&#039;s hard to stop. I found that Moxy at low doses did not give me a raging hard on but by the time I got to about 10-12mg in my system I was pretty well running full mast. Beyond the sweet spot dose, things will start getting visual and normally when people are melting I have a hard time being a sex god but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />MDMA / MDA are both fantastic for love but not the best for sex as you probably already know. I think my strategy going forward for amazing sex with the compounds is going to be to take a lower dose for myself coupled with some Viagra and let the receiver take a larger dose so they can enjoy the act of being ravaged without me getting so distracted by their feelings that I just want to cuddle up and kiss them. I think the real key is that you want to dose the receiver just enough to enhance the feelings without getting them to the point of being distracted by the emotions either. My girl and I normally drop 200mg MDMA so I am thinking 100mg for me and 120-150 for her and see how that works.<br /><br />MXE - I&#039;ve been reading about this one and am probably going to put it on my list of things to try. It&#039;s supposed to have a euphoria that is pretty unrivaled but it&#039;s a disassociative so getting the dose right for sex might be a little tricky. It&#039;s cheap though so at least playing around shouldn&#039;t be too expensive.<br /><br />Meth, obviously, is going to be a great deal of fun for sex but again the dose is key. Some people don&#039;t feel sexy when they are on it and others do. The fucked up part of that is that a day of hot sex could honestly morph into an afternoon of cleaning the kitchen. Biggest issue with meth is it&#039;s hard to mix with any other drug. If you do meth it&#039;s best to just do meth and ride out whatever high you get. It&#039;s a pretty safe bet you&#039;ll have some good sex on it though and like most other drugs, having a little Viagra handy can help combat the plumbing issues that uppers can cause. If being used for a sexual adventure I would try my best to keep the stash out of reach because it&#039;s real easy to just get spun for days on the stuff when all you wanted was a few hours of sex play.<br /><br />Mephedrone is still on my list of drugs to try with sex. Not too expensive, doesn&#039;t last too long (couple hours). Has a high redosing desire though so you probably don&#039;t want to have too much of it on hand. <br /><br />I was hoping to give some LSD / MDMA a shot this weekend to see how that went but it looks like my LSD is not going to get here on time so I&#039;ll probably go with the backup and do some shrooms / MDMA and see how that works for me. I expect that combo to be emotional and spiritual rather than carnal and raw animalistic. <br /><br />Anyway, good luck! If you come up with some neat combos that work for you would love to hear how things go! One of my general tips for turning a trip sexual is to start the sex before the drugs. Get things going a little bit and then start getting high. Seems to keep the mood alive longer for me anyway.

				It turns out I made a really stupid mistake, and accidentally signed as well as encrypted my mailing address, which meant the vendors needed my public key to decrypt them.<br /><br />I may have pissed Isomerism off, I can&#039;t tell. BlueGiraffe was very sweet about it. I didn&#039;t realize what I had done until she explained it to me.<br /><br />I&#039;m still kicking myself over that one. What a durp.<br /><br />Anyway, I have sent both my public key AND an unsigned version of my address to each of them, and hopefully they won&#039;t be too mad at me.<br /><br />I do want to continue to do business with them, after all.

				My room is such a mess.<br /><br />I have to clear out my room just to make space for the lab equipment.<br /><br />I&#039;m making slow progress, but the packages won&#039;t be arriving till next week at the earliest, so I can take my time chewing through the clutter.
