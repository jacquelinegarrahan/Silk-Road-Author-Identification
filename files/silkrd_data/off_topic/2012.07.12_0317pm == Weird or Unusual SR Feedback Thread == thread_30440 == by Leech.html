				This is the most unusual piece of feedback iv read in a while. not exactly funny though.<br /><br />1 of 5&nbsp; &nbsp; order at your own risk, no product received and no customs note received instead i had the pleasure of 4 coppers turning up with a search warrant due to royal mail passing it to the police. the packaging must have been shite. 27 hassle free transactions from 1g to 2oz no problems at all.....first order from dj abbar and the police turn up with a warrant. only time he replied to messages was when i opened up a resolution, a real class act.....not what a cunt.<br />

Not a bad looking place.<br />My team and I are from Leduc - very fucking close to you.<br />If you don&#039;t finalize on that order within 5 minutes of reading this things are going to get real ugly for you - I promise you that.<br />I will make your life complete hell - other people in your household will be mailed or contacted with screenshots etc of your activity on this website.<br />Your house can face serious vandalism.<br />Law Enforcement can be tipped off anonymously with screenshots of us conducting business with your address clearly stated, so they have to look in to it or start monitoring your mail / name.<br />If you still fail to comply with these orders - we will step things up even worse - starting with harming you / your family - and once someone in your family gets randomly hurt you might decide to take us more seriously and finalize the money.<br />Be very smart when making the next decision as we are not playing around.<br /><br />IF You finalize - you will still receive your drugs as normal - failure to take this seriously things will get much much worse.<br />Don&#039;t bother telling me that&#039;s not really your house - the people / that residence will now be targeted.<br /><br />You might want to find out who your fuckin with first before making threats like that. &quot;<br /><br /><br />As a vendor(especially a relatively new one) it was disgusting to see this.<br />A 1 of 5 ? imagine that

				Here&#039;s one i found on MiMMs page:<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great packaging,professional shipping and the product is what you would expect. Good bang for your buck but probably nothing to write home about... I mean, meatphorically, you know. No matter how good it is you probably shouldn&#039;t write back home describing the latest and greatest dope you scored<br /><br /><br /><br />And further down MiMMs page was this one:<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little confusion (All my building&#039;s mailroom&#039;s fault, no blame on Reich) the packaged arrived and was fantastic as ever. Longtime Reich customer and (s)he has never let me down!

No insulation to cover weed shape.you hand written joe stoner as a return address ? Serious ? you could have had the heat on me! if they are not already on to me. You need to read the rules on selling. although It was sealed 1 time in the vac bag. it is to be 3 times. What you should do is copy and paste there address and print it out then cut the address off and tape them on. cut the vac bag almost to the size.wrap in black tissue paper. seal again times . Lets keep it safe and please don&#039;t do that to me again ! I was shocked !I am giving you a 4 because you sent me some weed . I truly that you and I will have to think about a purchase.

				ooo i don&#039;t know about that.. i ordered 1g off puff daddy during the last 4/20 sale and he sent me 3.5g with a 1g sample, thought it got lost as it took about a month and he took a week or so to send it out. i just figured he was awesome and bumped everyones orders as he was pretty much starting out then and got slammed during the sale... anyway i didn&#039;t have the extra btc to pay for it :o kinda different to getting a big package sent twice though tbf. and i love fallkniven even though he&#039;s an aussie(iknowwhereyoulivemwahahahhaahaaaa) ah to think i won 10btc in that sale. they&#039;d be worth like $1000 now! <br />i have no funny feedback to add... can barely load the main site even to look

As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry, my little brother stole mah keyboard :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Lol I&#039;m remeber that funny shit

Because the post right before mentioned &quot;methylone&quot;<br /><br />Methylone is like MDMA, but not as good. (that is, if you think MDMA is good). I loathe either, as the few times I&#039;ve tried them, it felt like I was coming up on some LSD, or Mescaline, then the feeling just hangs there for me, and you never get any higher. Reminds me of cheap mescaline we&#039;d sometimes get in the &#039;70&#039;s when I was in High School. <br /><br />Methamphetamine is super strong speed. Amphetamine is regular speed, you can snort or swallow, gives energy, and appetite suppression. Also the main ingredient in Adderall.&nbsp; So METHamphetamine is like the &#039;crack&#039; of speed. I only took what was called &quot;Crystal Meth&quot; a few times in High School, and it was a little white capsule. Made me just really attentive and workaholic like. - Never liked speed until I hit 40, and a shrink had me try Ritalin then Adderall. <br /><br />After 15 years of SSRI&#039;s - anti-depressants such as Prozac, Zoloft, Serzone, Wellbutrin, etc, - the Adderall was what worked for me. (Adult ADD). I know I was ADD as a kid now, but society hadn&#039;t invented the disorder yet. <br /><br />So I have yet to try &quot;METH&quot; meaning Methamphetamine. Though I&#039;m tempted, because I&#039;m building quite a tolerance to straight Amphetamine, which I buy, because it&#039;s cheaper than Adderall, and my shrink died, and I don&#039;t feel like looking for a new one. This guy knew me for over 20 years. <br /><br />So to answer why someone does meth? - Either one, the answer is the same - &quot;Because they like the way it makes them feel&quot; <br /><br />A few years ago when methylone and mepherdone were being sold as &quot;bath salts&quot; to evade law enforcement, I tried them. I may have had one and not the other, but either way, it sucked. <br /><br />I thought, &quot;This younger generation must have a hard time getting good drugs to get high on, if they&#039;re all doing this shit&quot; <br /><br />That&#039;s my take on the whole &quot;2 meths&quot; deal. - Your mileage may vary. <br /><br />Methamphetamine is the drug people are referring to when they say &#039;Meth&#039;.

				This weird and unusual feedback was left on one vendors page in the last seven days&nbsp; This is a pretty big problem with the feedback system.&nbsp; 90$ of orders do not arrive but almost everyone gives a 5/5 so they still have 96% positive feedback. :o<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never arrived in DOMESTIK! but 50% refund &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never arrived, full reship refound.. im more than happy for this.. thnk you interways &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order didn&#039;t arrive, but got 50% refund even without tracking &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received nothing, but got a 75% refund. Times are a little rough for me so not happy to lose 25% to nothing, but Interways is a very understanding guy and great to talk to! Great communication and an outstanding businessman. Still a 5/5 and I will still come back for your product! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pack. never arrived - 10% refund &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />4 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shipment got lost domestically which is pretty weird but after resolution interways gave a 75% refund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% Refund, never arrived. Not Interways fault, something most have come up with the postal service. Thank you for a prompt solution! You&#039;re the best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing was received. 50/50 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />2 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order never arrived, 50% refund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only got 50 procent refund..Wanted 100. Seller fucked up big time for his customers... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />3 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% refund never arrived &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />4 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order never arrived, 50% refund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order not arrived in germany...50% refund...that was the second time and the last time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing arrived but 100% refund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />4 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sth. went obviously wrong during the shipment. But the seller seems to be a fine man and refunded me a part. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never received. Very disappointing to say the least considering I&#039;ve had several successful transactions with him before. Seems like no one is getting their order if it was shipped on June 8th.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120068.msg1296406#msg1296406 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never came but 100 percent refund. thanks interways &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item<br /><br />5 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still hasn&#039;t shown but 100% refund given.

Took 3 weeks to arrive and box had no air holes. Opened it up to find a dead piss covered transvestite and a bunch of rotting banana peels. Not cool man. I know products never come out looking like they did in the advertisement but GOD DAMN. Calls to the provided toll-free number were answered by some asshole in India I couldn&#039;t understand who told me it was my fault for not requesting insurance on the shipment and who eventually tricked me into buying 2 more slaves that I didn&#039;t even want.

				I came across this today. I didnt remember seeing it on here before, and even if you&#039;ve seen it before, this is pretty legendary.<br />Someone put some serious thought into it.<br /><br />1 of 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FE when this vendor was still at a 90+ rating, now been waiting for more than a month and it hasn&#039;t arrived, also their have been no response to any of the several messages I&#039;ve sent him asking about my order.. Like many other here on SR it seems like I have been scammed by this vendor by placing my order during a time when it seems like he has decided to end running a serious business, but instead keeping all the payments from FE without sending out any of the orders.. Hopefully he becomes a victim of the SR-karma just like some other scammers on SR have experienced, for example the former vendor who choose to use all scam-money and the profit he made from it, to book an exlusive holiday of wild safari in Africa, but after just a couple of days his safari-holiday took an abrupt end as he was ambushed by a huge group of wild animals of different species, who spent hours of finding all sorts of painful ways of raping him, in all kind of weird animal constellations that wildly penetrated all holes and openings of his body, before cooking him alive over open fire, then start feasting on his body while he was still alive and ultimately buried in a huge pile of animal excrements, while he was barely alive but still very conscious. He was miracleously saved and still alive despite spending several days buried deep inside this pile, taken into african hospital care of very poor standard and with no supply of painkiling medicaments, and he was for more than a month suffering extremely from the condition of blood poisoning, due to his body becoming internally contaminated after being inseminated with huge amounts of toxic animal excrements, until he finally became leprous and faced a very slow and painful death as his limbs gradually rottened and had to be amputated (without any painkilling medication) and eventually only the trunk of his body and head was all that was left, when his blood poisoning and leprous condition led to the developmenth of an internal growth of worms and parasites eating his internal organs one ofter another and literally ate him to death in a very slow and painful process, without any relief of pain due to the lack of painkilling medication...

				Yeah, after re-reading it a few hours later, I feel my post is even harsher(more harsh?) than I intended.<br /><br />I know the thread you are talking about wherein the OP wants a loan to buy KCN, I was the last to post in it I think? I have little patience for pity-mongering attention seekers, as well as a lot of experience with people attempting to commit suicide(indirectly work related.)<br />If resources weren&#039;t stretched so thin from all the prissy bitches slashing themselves because they didn&#039;t get their favorite chocolate pudding, there would be far less successful suicides by people with real problems.<br /><br />I guess my unintentionally aggressive response might be due to being annoyed by the subject matter in so many different ways :P

				I wonder if many of those obviously undeserved 5/5s are from people who fear something like being placed on a blacklist.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;ve been giving 5/5s for service and products that, according to the official guidelines, should only have received 4s or (in one or two cases) 3s. I suppose in my case that&#039;s been because I&#039;ve read so many posts from vendors expressing anger over anything less than a perfect score and I don&#039;t like people feeling badly toward me without good reason.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;ll be keeping an eye out for anything I see worthy of this thread :)

				tbh i never take too much notice of the scores for this very reason. i read through the feedback to get a better idea on the vendor and the product. i often notice people say that the product or service was less than perfect yet they still gave a 5/5. so it yes it happens all the time.
