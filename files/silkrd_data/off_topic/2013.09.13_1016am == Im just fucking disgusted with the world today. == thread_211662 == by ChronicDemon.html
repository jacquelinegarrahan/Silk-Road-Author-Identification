				I dont think I even want to read it, you explained enough. I am not sure how much the exact price of a bullet is, but it would certainly solve the problem with that guy.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would be happy to donate a bullet a day for anyone who plans to or rapes children.

				I didn&#039;t read it either, the OP was enough. A bullet is too good and too easy a death for these types. All current forms of capital punishment are too easy for these animals. They should be killed very slowly and as painfully as possible. Shit, broadcast it live on TV and make it take 2 or 3 weeks. How can people be against capital punishment when it comes to scumbags like this.

				I usually stay neutral, but death would be best in some cases. <br />Then again, this guy goes to prison and i know prison has it&#039;s own rules and law. Those who are involved with children are lowest in the food chain in there.

				Ugh absolutely stomach-churning. He&#039;s clearly mentally ill and thank f-ck that they caught him before he lured any kids to his dungeon. People like that should just be given the lethal injection. It&#039;s like putting down a dog with rabies IMO.

				Guy certainly has some mental issues, and given that he solicited for a child to be abducted he probably is not just fantasizer. There is actually some evidence that people with the sickest fantasies are the least likely to act on them, and there are several examples of cases sort of similar to this where people were discussing very sick shit as well, and even talking about things they had done like this, and it turned out that none of them had actually done shit and it was all fantasy. That is actually a pretty common theme with the most sick sounding people, the people who say they butchered and ate kids are very unlikely to actually have done so. Of course, if they actually solicit for a kid to be kidnapped and butchered etc, it might be a different story. I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t justify what this guy did at all, but it is true that they find the most sick sounding people are often in fantasy and not actually planning to do things. But at the same time once he solicited a child to be kidnapped, he crossed the line as a child could really be kidnapped at his request. <br /><br />This guy is a bit extreme too, he actually built a dungeon and solicited someone to kidnap a child for him, so in his case it was probably not just fantasy, which is extremely disturbing. Pretty fucking disturbed individual without doubt, and that CP they were trading sounds like the worst ever. Even most of the extreme CP would not reach that level, it is not at all common and what they had is pretty certainly the worst of the worst. <br /><br />I think this is probably linked to the Violent Desires hidden service that got taken down by the Dutch police. I think it was considered the worst of all of the CP sites ever to exist, in terms of the violence depicted and the conversations of the people. I think this was first Tor hidden service related to CP to be busted, with pedoforum after it and then all the FH ones. Violent Desires was probably the worst of all. <br /><br />Really this guy obviously deserves to go to jail for the rest of his life considering he solicited help in abducting a child. I am shocked they are only trying to get him 27 years! He almost certainly had enough CP to get a life sentence, since every picture can be its own charge, and any jury would put this guy away. But I still do not think it is the pictures he had that should put him away, but his solicitation of a child. It is hard to argue for the freedom of people to look at such images, they are the worst images you could imagine. People looking at jailbait it doesn&#039;t bother me at all (nor would it bother me in many cases if they actually had sex with young teenagers), even people looking at a lot of younger CP doesn&#039;t really bother me (though they should not have sex with young children). CP like this actually causes an emotional reaction in me, and I have to wonder if somebody is into this are they really sane enough to be trusted outside of prison? But I still look past this emotional response, and use my sense of morality and logic. A picture of a severely abused child is not a severely abused child, many people who are into such images can keep their fantasies compartmentalized, there is no proof that people looking at such pictures causes children to be harmed, and it is magical thinking to think that viewing the picture causes the depicted child to be harmed again. I still do not think such image should be censored, because we need to have freedom of information we cannot have censorship no matter how disturbing the things some people enjoy looking at are. The same reason why I think it should be legal to look at jailbait or look at holocaust picture it holds for all information, and I cannot let an emotional feeling blind me to the immorality of censorship and prevent me from thinking in a rational way. <br /><br />Part of me can see the difference between someone who looks at an image like these guys were looking at and the people looking at other types of legal/illegal porn. Maybe something is much more wrong with this person than is wrong with someone who looks at softcore CP or jailbait, or even hardcore CP but not to such a totally extreme degree that it becomes cannibalistic snuff child porn. I am not sure. But maybe still people cannot control what they find sexually attractive, but can control themselves. Maybe these guys would have murdered a kid and ate the kid, but instead viewed images? I don&#039;t know. I do think it is fucked up FH admin going to prison for 100 years for hosting CP sites, and this guy is only facing under 30 years for trying to get somebody to kidnap a kid for him to eat. I think it is fucked up that CP laws put a person who looks at naked 15 year olds, something that is not really even an abnormal desire, in the same category as someone who looks at pictures of dead kids being cut into slabs of meat. But that is just at an emotional level. At a logical level, there is still a voice in my head telling me a picture is a picture, a picture of severe child abuse is not severe child abuse, a fantasy is not an action. But this person took it beyond a fantasy when he tried to get someone to kidnap a kid. So why is he only going to prison 27 years, when FH admin only hosted a site and did not try to get a child kidnapped to be murdered and eaten, and FH admin faces 100 years? <br /><br />This is the result of the emotional thinking, illogical laws. A person who solicits for a child to be killed so he can eat the child faces less time in prison than a person who hosted 1,000,000 or so CP images, because in the eyes of the emotional people the person who let 1000 people see 1,000,000 images of child abuse abused a child 1,000,000,000 times, and the person who tried to get a child to eat only planned to abuse one. <br />

				How am I going to know how many people saw the video of me being raped? If some anonymous person downloads the video, how am I going to know that? Better yet, if it is distributed via PIR like systems, it becomes essentially impossible for anybody to know the number of people who viewed the video. I already said in another thread, it is not somebody viewing the video that causes the distress in the person depicted, it is the possibility that somebody will see the video. After a video such as this is uploaded to the internet, the possibility for people to see it will exist regardless of if anybody ever does see it, and in many cases the person depicted in the video will never be able to tell if no people or a thousand people or a million people saw the video.

It is the possibility that someone will see the video that causes them stress, and that possibility is independent of anybody ever looking at the video or not.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In a world where distribution/possession is legal, it would be easy to find out.&nbsp; Your video would end up on Pornhub or some other site where the view count is conveniently displayed.&nbsp; Maybe a few people would use PIR systems to avoid the stigma of potentially being discovered as a CP viewer, but you and I both know that if it were legal most would not.<br /><br />Going back to the question I asked, do you think it makes sense to add an additional charge for producers or people closely tied to producers who upload content to the internet?&nbsp; I understand that it would violate the hard-line stance you usually take on censorship.<br /><br />

				In my eyes CP and jailbait lass&#039;s are completely different things, to me child porn is people abusing children (generallly people under 12 imo), that shits horrible cause the kids don&#039;t know properly whats&nbsp; doing, theyr just kids and should never be subjected to some nasty vicious adult taking out their sick fantasy on them. I accept that some people are pedos, same as some people are gay, and being a pedo isnt a crime in itself if you cant help it, its when you act on it, abusing kids and destroying their childhood then you become the evil cunt.<br /><br />Jailbait girls are generally 13+ (minimum, normally 15+), and i reckon that they&#039;re old enough to make their own decisions. Personally i wouldn&#039;t fuck anyone under 15 (and even that&#039;s depending on the 15 year old, if shes a kid mentally n physically then god no, but some people are mature for their age), but i know 14 year olds that are more developed physically and mentally than 25 year olds i know. Shit i don&#039;t see anything wrong with those relationships in most cases, so long as they arn&#039;t being forced into it/manipulated into it but that happens with people of all ages, i hate the lack of freedom and saying that people can&#039;t decide for themselves, the government saying a 15 year old cant fall in love with a 25 year old, than you can&#039;t put sweet sweet opiates into your body, that you fucking americans cant even have kinder eggs because the government says they&#039;re too dangerous. The worlds gone mad, they treat us like we&#039;re retarded babies..<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have never slept with underage teens and have no desire or plan to, i was just explaining whats acceptable in my eyes
