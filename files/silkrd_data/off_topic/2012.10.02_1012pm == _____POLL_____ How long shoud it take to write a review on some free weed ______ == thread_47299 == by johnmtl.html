				I received some hash today, and have already posted a review about it in the appropriate thread.&nbsp; (US to US vendor)<br /><br />Wasn&#039;t bad for plain old Moroccan.&nbsp; <br /><br />I try to get my feedback up there in a time frame that allows it to still be fresh in my mind.&nbsp; If I could just be as proactive in other areas of my life (such as getting around to cleaning my computer desk off)...<br /><br /><br />Especially if it was sent for the purpose of being reviewed!&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty on top of it.

				72 hours at the very most. There might be unexpected unfortunate circumstances that prevent you from having the time to smoke. More than 72 hours... you shouldn&#039;t be a weed tester.

				I would say the first three options, up to 72 hours is fair. If someone is on the sesh, they need time to recover, or they may have busy lives where work and family responsibility come first, or may have difficulties coming on here (as it&#039;s quite personal, many would want to do this alone) both sides need to understand one another, however it would be good etiquette if the reviewer could keep in touch with the vendor if there is a delay in writing the review. In a perfect word, all reviews would be posted under 24 hours, it&#039;s nice to be nice, and to contribute as fast as possible for the benefit of all, especially where freebies are concerned.
