				Anyone out there interested in exchanging torrent tracker invites.&nbsp; I have an IPtorrents.com invite and with the current attacks from LE I think it would be beneficial to have access to multiple trackers.<br /><br />I would also like to hear what methods for anonymonity ppl are using as well as any good reads/information based on bit torrent.&nbsp; I use transmission on a VBox running Linux.&nbsp; I send it through mullvad.&nbsp; Lets hear what the SRF can come up with.

				if you want real security get yourself access to a scene ftp dump. that is really the safest and quickest way to get releases, much faster then pretty much all trackers besides a select few private ones which run their own ftps. you should also get your own server, not just a vbox, and run rutorrent, its much better. you also shouldn&#039;t just come on here and ask for invites, if you actually want to join another tracker, build up your stats on ipt, start getting on irc and make friends with people, and then maybe you will get invited onto some better sites. theres also a few trackers that have irc invite channels, where you can go in there and apply for an invite.

				having your own server makes it in your full control, the real way to protect yourself is to be on private trackers that are harder to get onto. i&#039;m not longer on waffles, i let my account there die from inactivity because i use what much more. what.cd has 1,489,899 torrent currently with a ton of flac for the quality lovers. its my go to music site, however, unless you have a server or seedbox of some kind, it is pretty hard to keep a good ratio. if your on what, you don&#039;t need to be on waffles. btn is a great tv only site, friendly staff, quick speeds, and its easy to keep a positive ratio because of the way they are set up. the best 0-day tracker currently around is scc, hands down no compition. if sct was still around, i would say sct, but that sadly is no longer here :(&nbsp; ipt is a general p2p tracker, with both scene relases and p2p releases, i don&#039;t know too much about it anymore as i no longer have an account due to inactivity. i would recommend torrentleech as a general/p2p tracker over ipt. it has a huge huge huge user base which gives it top speeds, as well as decent pre times, and a huge selection of p2p releases. i won&#039;t give out any invites to any sites, as that would reveal my identity way to easily, however, i will answer any questions about various trackers if you have any questions.
