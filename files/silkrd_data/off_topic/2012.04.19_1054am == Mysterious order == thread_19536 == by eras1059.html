				Hi,<br /><br />Not had this happen before but I went to the sorting office today to pick up a package because it didn&#039;t have the correct postage paid on it. I assumed this was an eBay order or something but when I opened it there was a bunch of paper for padding, then one of those small plastic baggy&#039;s in there and inside that was another with lots of smiley faces on the front with a small, round pressed pill in. I honestly cannot remember ordering anything like this and so I&#039;m very confused and concerned that it managed to end up at my house.<br /><br />Is there any Silk Road administration staff around who might be able to show me my past orders or something in case I&#039;m having a stupid moment on something I&#039;ve ordered? As it stands I have no idea what this product is.<br /><br />Many thanks!<br />Eras.

				Go to your account page and see if you&#039;ve left any feedback, or check your messages to see if they ring any bells. Purchasing stats don&#039;t give detailed information on your single purchases, but if you can single it out.... <br />If you think you haven&#039;t ordered the stuff, there could be a reasonable explanation; The dealer (that you might have done business with previously) might have not destroyed your details and got them mixed up.......unlikely, but not impossible. ;D

				Wow, I had no idea how to access those lists! That explains how people can edit their feedback after early finalisation... many thanks for pointing that our, Maribo!<br /><br />Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t see any orders for what I received which does hint at the possibility you mentioned about my details getting mixed up... I guess I&#039;ll just contact my previous sellers who sell pills and see if they package their products in the way I got mine.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help, Maribo! :)
