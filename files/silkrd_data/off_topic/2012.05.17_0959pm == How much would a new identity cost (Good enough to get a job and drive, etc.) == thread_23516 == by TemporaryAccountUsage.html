				Hello, I&#039;m 16 years old and would like to live on my own. Unfortunately the U.S. laws don&#039;t allow this. So how much would it cost/is it possible to get a new identity in which I am 18-19 years old?<br /><br />P.S. No my life isn&#039;t bad and my parents are doing their best, blah, blah, blah. Don&#039;t even bother. It&#039;s just that I simply want to live on my own, as a fully functioning human being.

				yeah, because once you&#039;re eighteen you can just get a job and live on your own, right?<br /><br />dude, you haven&#039;t even completed college, there&#039;s no way you&#039;re gonna survive on your own.

				&nbsp;:-\<br /><br />Man, I get it. I&#039;ve been there when I was that age. You know just up and leave (and I did for awhile) but I mean being that age there&#039;s like this instant starter in your brain where you just want grow the hell up. It&#039;s not all what you probably think its going to be like.<br /><br />In any case, check the forgeries section on SR. That should guide you.

				Grow the hell up by being patient and doing well in high school and going on to college so you have some future ahead of you. Sometimes you gotta stick through it. You&#039;ll get out of your parent&#039;s hair soon enough. Just two more years to go!

				Not possible at that age, you&#039;re just going to have to wait it out until you&#039;re eighteen but honestly it&#039;s not what it seems. I moved out when I was young as well because I thought I was smart enough to make it on my own and make it to the top, well I was wrong. Seriously be grateful you have a roof over your head with a meal to eat everyday because it sucks being on your own and all you can eat is stuff off the 99 cent menu. Yeah you don&#039;t need an education to get a job but you do need experience and you don&#039;t have any so why would they hire you over the older guy that does? <br /><br />The best advice I can give you is to enjoy the free ride as long as you can, take classes at a community college to get a feel for what you want to do. I wish I could go back in time and do that but I can&#039;t so here&#039;s me saying it to you instead of my younger self.

				I felt the same way as you growing up and am now dealing with a sibling in the same situation. Although I can&#039;t say college got me a great paying job as of yet it taught me invaluable lessons about life and gave me the ability to learn about subjects&nbsp; was interested in. Stay at your parents and appreciate what you have because if you don&#039;t now you will eventually and trust me I HATED my parents and had a crazy ride in high school and sill look back and miss some stuff. The biggest thing is that after moving out of your parents place your relationship will get way better hopefully. did for me. Showed them I COULD live on my own and do ok without their help and yeah.....just stick it out

				I did the same thing when I was under 18, rented some ghetto ass house and sold drugs at raves and concerts for 2 months. Made a fair bit of cash for my age but it is not something that works long term. You wont go high up in the drug world without a decent education trust me you will make max 60g a year being a highschool drop out dealer and society wont respect you and you will be in and out of jail most likely.

				A legitimately new identity?&nbsp; Tens of thousands of dollars.<br /><br />A stolen identity?&nbsp; Anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand depending on how many folks are sharing the same identity.<br /><br />Just let it go...&nbsp; Literally every single person I know that left home and school early is now in their 30s working alongside high school students for peanuts... and despise their younger selves decision making abilities.
