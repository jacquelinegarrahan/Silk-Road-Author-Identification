				This is one of those things I ask most guys I meet, I think you can tell a lot about a guy depending on the answer they give you.. Soo... How young would you go? Also girls feel free to chime in.<br /><br />I&#039;m 20 and I would probably fuck a 16 year old (hey, its legal here!!!).. but if she was really bangin&#039;, like really peng (hot), and a slut, I might go to 15 cause they&#039;re into some wild daddy-issues shit at that age plus the whole tightness angle. Gotta get that shit. <br /><br />There are also some interesting caveats to this.. Like, would you fuck a 13 year old if she looked 25? Or just a blowjob? Haha, oh and for those who think this is somehow immoral/wrong, I refer you to a quote from karate kid 2 &quot;don&#039;t hate the player, hate the game. And the court case&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am 17 and really only like girls my age or older (in the last year ive dont stuff with 7 girls youngest was 4 months younger than me). I finished high school will be starting uni in sept have my own condo which is 60% paid for by me the other part by my parents have my own car which I purchased with my money. I expect girls I am with to have their life together and excel in all areas of life tbh I find girls that are leaders and have their shit together and all that more attractive that really hot girls that are a mess, not really into the one night stand thing that can lead to a lot of problems, especially considering I have not had a vasectomy and girls were I live try hard to get prego.

				hey Kappacino<br /><br />&nbsp; You should add a 18-21 and a 21+ option to the poll. I&#039;d say 16 if it&#039;s legal where you live or 18+ if that&#039;s the legal cut off. I&#039;d say it has more to do with the age difference of the two, rather then an age limit. I&#039;d say 10 year diff is ok, if your 26 or older. if your younger then that 16+.

				well 14.5 year olds sexual development can not be differentiated from 18 year olds, but I have heard that 15 is where mental development reaches the point where there is not as much &#039;yielding to elders&#039;, so from a physical attraction point of view anyone who says 18 but not 14.5 is a liar, but 15 seems to be the best overall age to allow consent, if you take both participants perspectives into consideration (which of course you should).

				Very well said N2, +1 Karma for you.<br /><br />Regarding age, a 20 year old going out with a 16 year old is only a 4 year age gap which is acceptable. If a 30 year old did it that is a 14 year age gap and most people would think he is a bit of a nonce. Personally I do not find teenagers attractive and would much rather go out with a woman who has an actual woman&#039;s body AND can give a decent blowjob. Plus teenagers are emotional drama zones, just can&#039;t be fucked with all that to be honest.

				N2Deep got it right.&nbsp; That&#039;s what i&#039;ve always gone by, 1/2 your age + 7 for relationships.&nbsp; I always bring that up with people and they look at me like I&#039;m crazy and they have never heard of it, I thought everyone knew that... but I&#039;d probably go as low as 17 or 18 if it was a one night thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />But what the fuck am I thinking anyways?&nbsp; I&#039;m married and would never cheat.

And additionally, at some point, some of us have daughters of our own....the first time I dated a woman closer in age to my kid then myself it gave me a moment of pause. <br /><br />As for your demographic assumptions I think youd be surprised at how many older people are here. While I am aware there are quite a few youngsters, as their presence is more obvious due to their lack of discretion, younger enthusiasts of altered states are quite often well networked in the actual world, able to find dealers, and less able to discretely accept packages. and quite often financially less able to indulge in larger purchases when the &quot;quick deal&quot; arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;There are quite a few older members that read an article somewhere....and came here because often times.... As the years pass our lives progress, the risk of losing it all becomes more significant.........we not only loose those connections that in our youth provided us with the tools of our intoxications but also the desire to have connections to them anymore.&nbsp; SR makes it far easier to find what we desire discreetly.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Almost always when I hear people going batshit about the thought of sex with anyone under 18, they are in their 40s+ (or females), where as I find it quite common for (males) in their teens and twenties to be fairly open about not giving much of a shit (or even endorsing the idea :P ). I haven&#039;t held a scientific study or anything though. Also there are probably quite a few older folk here, but there was a poll that showed late teens to mid twenties as the most common age range, and I think this would hold true even if everyone here voted honestly on the poll. Internet drug scene is dominated by this age range, and it makes sense, its the generation that grew up on the internet and its the age range where people use drugs the most. <br /><br />I do agree that it is cultural indoctrination though, I think this is also reflected in age groups as it seems to me younger people are less influenced by traditional sorts of indoctrination. This can be seen by looking at statistics for drug legalization, the older the group the more they are in favor of criminalization (% wise), and the younger the group the more people are in favor of decriminalization (% wise). There is probably more to it than that though, but it is an observation I have made. Perhaps the fact that younger people are the internet generation comes into play in a serious way, older folk didn&#039;t have access to so much information and got most of their information from localized sources and also through traditional media and government channels. It might not be strange to someone to think that 18+ is absolute moral truth if that is what the &quot;authority&quot; figures in their area say, what they see on television and what their friends say they also believe. But it quickly reduces to absurdity when you regularly talk with people from countries with age of consent ranging from 14 to 21, and see that people in some places are being labeled as vicious sexual predators for doing things that are perfectly legal in the country of the normal person you talk to regularly, who lives a thousand miles away from you (or even just a stones throw away). <br /><br />Also when you communicate with your local friends you will be much less likely to be bluntly honest about your beliefs, versus talking on the internet, which most perceive as anonymous even without taking any measures. Interacting with &#039;the masses&#039; online probably gives a better view of what the masses truly believe, versus interacting with them in meat space. Of course this may not be the case anymore now that government is flooding pseudonyms into every nook and cranny of the internet (using fairly sophisticated software at that!) to distort the perception of public opinion (they are starting to become more modernized with their propaganda, but it did take them a while to catch up, as always)

				Little story, when i was 25 i met this chick (first time i was rolling btw), didn&#039;t talk at that occasion but she was flirting. Few weeks later by accident i meet her again so we hit it off, texted for a bit and we everything was going so smoothly and she wanted to come to my place. <br /><br />Now, i still didn&#039;t know her age at that point but i figured she was in college or something. Met for a few times, didn&#039;t have sex but just made out. Went to see a few movies, she could follow me pretty good in some deeper discussions so yeah.<br /><br />Then after a few weeks for once i got her voicemail and this scared the crap out of me, she was sounding at least 5 years younger than i figured she would be (i didn&#039;t bother to ask her age until that point because, well, it just never came up). So i asked her what was her major in college, she replied she was still in highschool.&nbsp; :o And, no, not a senior, she was fucking 15.. You can imagine how totally perplexed i was, at that point i was just lucky to not have had real intercourse with her yet. <br /><br />The weirdest thing though is that her fucking FATHER brought her to my apartment a couple of time. Many years later i still can totally comprehend this. <br /><br />Needless to say i broke it off. But still in many ways she was more grown intellectually than girls my own age at the time so i guess age doesn&#039;t mean a lot. <br /><br />(disclaimer, i&#039;m not at all attracted to young chicks in general, most of my gfs have been my age or older).

I&#039;m more than happy to admit I&#039;m fairly young, I won&#039;t say more than that other than I&#039;m over 18.<br />I don&#039;t think it comes down just to hormones going crazy at that age, but look at our culture, they&#039;re told from a very young age that that&#039;s what you&#039;re supposed to do to get boys\men to like you and if you don&#039;t you&#039;re not a real woman. <br />While it may take young girls a while to figure out the hypocrisy in this the guys out there my age, and especially older as I&#039;m getting the impression a lot of you are, clearly know this and are using it to take advantage of undeveloped per-adolescents.<br /><br />Honestly it&#039;s all well and good to sit here and have a laugh at fucking a 15 year old because hell, nobody will ever know who you are. But what does it say about yourself? That you sit there fantasizing about girls half your age because women with a fully developed brain wouldn&#039;t go near you. <br /><br />It&#039;s not hard to tell when someone is genuinely interested you as a person, and when a little girl has seen gossip girl and wants to be like Paris Hilton and suck off a dead-beat junkie. Sorry about the negativity, but this is a drug forum. But by all means, continue telling us how desperate you are.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just... what?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know where you&#039;ve conjured these assumptions from, but they&#039;re not based in reality that&#039;s for sure. I don&#039;t fantasise about 15 year olds. I just said.. that&#039;s the youngest I would go, in certain specific situations.<br /><br />I think your notions about women are just wrong - &quot;It&#039;s not hard to tell when someone is genuinely interested you as a person, and when a little girl has seen gossip girl and wants to be like Paris Hilton and suck off a dead-beat junkie.&quot; It&#039;s nothing to do with media influence. Nothing, at all. It&#039;s to do with the fire of desire and lust, deep need for procreation imbedded in the DNA of every single person.. that means that adolescent girls are horny as fuck. They want to suck dick because they like the idea of having a dick in their mouth.. They&#039;re driven to that expression because of the overwhelming desire they have for it. Gary Oak called that &quot;giving in to their hormones&quot;. Well what do you call it when a 25 year old woman drops to her knees..? It&#039;s the same emotion, just one has been breathing in and out for 10 years longer. <br /><br />And it certainly isn&#039;t because &quot;society has told them to be that way and if they aren&#039;t that way they think they&#039;re not a real woman.&quot; It&#039;s nothing to do with that. If anything, her logical side, her upbringing, will tell her she&#039;s a slut if she follows her sexual desire. It&#039;s the inner heat, the insatiable craving and lust to be taken/filled that goes to her very core, that actually leads to her doing sexual things. You know, to reproduce/perpetuate genes - kinda one of the main biological aspects of evolution - I didn&#039;t know that it was actually due to societal upbringing and episodes of gossip girl. I was under the impression that it was something to do with the nature of the universe itself but yeah I&#039;ll go with that, gossip girl it is.<br /><br />&quot;But what does it say about yourself?&quot; - That I would fuck a 15 year old girl under certain circumstances? That&#039;s pretty much all it says, unless of course, you&#039;re masturbating with ideas that you&#039;ve plucked out of thin air. <br /><br />

Sexual development peaks at 14.5 so people who say they are not sexually attracted to this age are liars as well (although to be fair sexual attraction is only part of the equation in regards to how young would you go, mental development is the more important thing to take into consideration, and that seems to be adequate at 15) <br /><br />In all seriousness though, you are clearly falling victim to the is/ought fallacy:<br /><br />X IS Y , so X OUGHT to be Y <br /><br />is a fallacy, that I am amazed so many people fail to see.<br /><br />jews are being exterminated so jews ought to be exterminated <br /><br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy<br /><br />such complete and utter lack of having an opinion or ability to think independently is disgusting to me

Studies have proven the negative effects of drug use at early ages, and I can assure you that sex can also do a lot of physical and mental harm at a young age as well. It&#039;s not as if I even find it offensive based solely on the law, but based on my own morals. We&#039;re talking about teenagers, not adults, anyone that tells themselves it&#039;s okay because they seemed &#039;mature for their age&#039; is just making excuses and probably needs to mature themselves.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry to call you out kmfkewm, but your judgement is way to clouded by apparent hate against the government to give any honest credibility.

So following this logic, everyone should feel free to fuck little kids, rob hard working citizens, and smoke crack in the street. They&#039;re illegal because the government&#039;s evil and made them so. Don&#039;t forget to wear your tinfoil hat while you do it, kmfkewm has plenty to share I&#039;m sure.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />debating with people like you is entirely pointless but its still fun, sort of like shooting fish in a barrel I guess. You are the one who said this:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A major problem I have about this is that where I&#039;m from, that&#039;s statutory rape. :-\ I don&#039;t care where the hell you&#039;re from, because I&#039;m simply stating why I find this debate offensive and that is all.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This quite clearly demonstrates that your mental process goes something like this:<br /><br />a.&nbsp; If something IS this way then it OUGHT to be that way<br />b. The law says this IS immoral so I find it immoral because if it wasn&#039;t immoral the law wouldn&#039;t be that way <br /><br />I put no words into your mouth. You are the one who said this, only after I pointed out the complete mindlessness of the logic did you back peddle and say that it being illegal isn&#039;t the *only* reason you find it immoral. <br /><br />I never said all illegal things should be done or should be legal. I actually gave the example that I think stealing is bad, but I don&#039;t think stealing is bad because it is illegal. Thinking something is bad because it is illegal shows a complete lack of having your own opinion and a dangerous and blind adherence to authority. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think people should fuck little kids (but do think that the definition of little kid is not something to be defined by the government and followed blindly by its slaves). I think stealing is bad. I think smoking crack in the street should be legal of course. <br /><br />You strike me as surprisingly Statist for someone on such a forum <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> They&#039;re illegal because the government&#039;s evil and made them so.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My logic is actually this:<br /><br />Fucking little kids is bad because they are incapable of coming to informed consent (but by 15 most can)<br />Stealing is bad because it violates the non-aggression principle <br />Smoking crack in the street is not bad<br /><br />your logic is this<br /><br />Fucking little kids is bad because the government says so<br />Stealing is bad because the government says so*<br />Smoking crack in the street is bad because the government says so<br /><br />*Does not apply to stealing when done by the government, clearly showing that you completely lack principles&nbsp; <br />

You can&#039;t blame me for feeling the way I do, I&#039;m just being protective. Each one of you who feel fine having sex with girls that young just remind me of that idiotic show 16 and Pregnant. On the off chance she winds up pregnant, you&#039;d better god damn have the balls to raise that child to the very best of your being and not dip out like a complete coward. As I know we all experiment with a wide variety of drugs here, I really hope none of you involve these young girls in any of those drugs as well. Being the misanthropist I am, I just can&#039;t help but feeling like there are enough idiots out there breeding already, with most of my friends being the exception.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />so you would be ok with a younger guy taking advantage of your daughter?<br /><br />I think its odd that so many men are more threatened by a grown man that would actually take care of their daughter, than they are by teenage boys that are just going to take turns with her, and do nothing of any real merit for her.
