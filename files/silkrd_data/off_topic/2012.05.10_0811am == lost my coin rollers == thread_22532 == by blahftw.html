				i know this is a stupid question.&nbsp; but i have $10 in quarters, and $5 in dimes that i need to deposit in my bank account, before my loan payment comes out in a few days.&nbsp; most banks don&#039;t take loose change.&nbsp; if i counted out the proper change, and rolled it up in regular paper, and taped it closed, do you think that would be good enough?&nbsp; can&#039;t they weigh the homemade roll to confirm the money is right?&nbsp; or should i go to a coinstar, and get raped for 9% and just bite the bullet?<br /><br />i hate giving coinstar money, but since i can&#039;t find my rollers, maybe i can dump a bucks worth of pennies in there to cover their fee.&nbsp; i know this makes me sound like a cheap bastard, but i really am that broke at the moment.&nbsp;

				yeah, that would probably be the best bet.&nbsp; if i&#039;m gonna spend a buck anyway, i might as well have more for next time.&nbsp; i did think about walmart, but seems like they were a bit more expensive there the last time i looked.&nbsp; i should have thought about the dollar store.&nbsp; good lookin out.&nbsp;

				Some banks have free coin counting services if you are a member. But no they wont take precounted rolls, think how easy that could be faked, even by weight.

				where i live, they want them pre rolled.&nbsp; which makes no sense to me, i would think they would rather run them through a roller themselves.&nbsp; but this place is ass backwards.&nbsp;
