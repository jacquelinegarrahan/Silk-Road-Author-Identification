				Been through some very rough time recently and the only way out of this will be carding. <br /><br />Lost most of my contacts in RL due to ppl snitching and promised myself i wont get back into this but I have to. Unfortunately is a life/death situation and I need a lot of money in a short period of time. All I need are verified markets or private forums with good dumps, 101 preferably. <br /><br />I got the rest. <br /><br />I had a look on hackBB and TCF, not impressed. Also many scammers on hidden wiki, beware.<br /><br />Any info is welcomed even if its in PM. <br /><br />Thank you in advance, don&#039;t let me down.

				i call bullshit because it&#039;s a law that american citizens get covered up to 250k in fraud whether it be bank or credit card and that&#039;s not supposed to affect your credit so either that story is bullshit or the guy is a fed trying to prevent credit fraud on sr

				Pretty sure the 250k your talking about is when a bank goes bankrupt and no longer have your funds, the government reimburses you. Could someone please confirm/deny this? Obviously there are laws about protecting consumers from fraud but i think your talking about something different.

				Credit card corps have tried to pass off the fraud to the customer now. If your card is stolen and frauded it takes months to get refunded if they do so at all.

				<br />http://sbinformation.about.com/lw/Business-Finance/Small-business-and-entrepreneurs/How-to-Reduce-Your-Risk-of-Credit-Card-Fraud.htm<br /><br />&quot;The explosion in credit card fraud is costing businesses more than consumers. Reason being is consumers enjoy plenty of built-in protections and legal remedies against of credit card fraud. Charges made on stolen credit cards held by individuals are routinely dismissed by credit card companies and consumer credit accounts can be shut down within minutes of a card holder having discovered a lost or stolen card. Unfortunately, someone has to pay -- and in this case, it&#039;s the merchants. Not only must they repay the credit card company for the cost of the goods fraudulently charged in the name of the swindled customer, but they also will be assessed a chargeback-related administrative fee by the credit card company and they likely will never be able to recover the contested merchandise. &quot;

There is no protection for theft or fraud or embezzlement.<br />For example--9/11, everyone ran to their bank to take out their money. This created a situation wIhere people were trying to take out more money than the bank actually has--they become illiquid and their assets get FROZEN over night.

				guys, honestly I don&#039;t know if any of you have ever carded. I know for sure the shop owner gets his money. My way of carding does not involve items below 2k. There are established companies, many of them are fine with getting carded, they do get the money a bit later but they are selling 30K watches dont tell me the fat fuck with a 60K rolex will get affected and keep in mind that for that 60k watch he probably left few families in debt or ruined their lifes. I know what I&#039;m talking about, I started carding in 2007.<br /><br />Please dont tell me they struggle. History teaches us that the upper class takes all the money while they keep middle class keep fighting over pointless indoctrinated views on life. Us, the poor are there to scare the shit out of middleclass. My homecounty has been entierly sold. <br /><br />No one seems to bother about that but when someone like me that wants to seal from people that have stolen from you, me, your parents, friends and close ones becomes the bad guy? Are you fucking serious?<br /><br />It is common sense that if someone steals from your bank account the bank will cover the loos thats why you keep your money in bank for them to keep it safe. If they fail at keeping your money safe they&#039;ll give it to you. Please shut up and stop reading articles on the web against fraud. My moms card got cloned and they used 1.5K. They canceled everything and nothing really happend with her credit history and she havent lost one penny. It was a 5 mins conversations over the phone and it was all sorted. <br /><br />So many timewasters on here...incredible

				If you&#039;re cashing dumps, you shouldn&#039;t be buying them either. A guy with a database of cards should be giving them to you and taking a percentage instead of selling them. Usually it&#039;s only middle men who sell dumps, guys who have bought secondhand frauded cards and they aren&#039;t worth shit. <br /><br />That&#039;s why a lot of carding forums don&#039;t accept Bitcoin, because their profit margins are so small. They are buying from wholesaler A and middle-manning to buyer B. If price of Bitcoin fluctuates a dollar or so they lose their profit. If you were sniffing dumps and had thousands of them you wouldn&#039;t give a fuck about Bitcoin price fluctuation because your inventory is free in the first place.<br /><br />The Romanian/russian and Azerbaijani fraud forums typically have job postings looking for cash out teams you shouldn&#039;t need to buy any cards if you&#039;re a reliable casher. I&#039;m surprised this scam still works, usually easier to just rent a botnet and fish bank details, then use it to buy bitcoins and cash out. Of course there&#039;s a game on how you send a fraud wire to a bitcoin exchange or soft bank transfer, but it&#039;s still possible. <br /><br />Those guy&#039;s selling counterfeit $100 USD, surprised they aren&#039;t running a whole network of bitcoin-&gt;mail cash cashout. Accept bitcoins ,send counterfeit money. profit. If somebody finds out make a new site.<br />

				I don&#039;t hate on other peoples hustle to each his own.&nbsp; But people are right you never know how your going to affect people IRL and yea some may have insurance coverage to cover stolen cards and what not but they also have to go through a lot of crap before there able to get reinstated there money or have that taken of there credit report so it still affects people.&nbsp; If your going to steal at least have the balls to do it to there face instead of being a sneak thief.
