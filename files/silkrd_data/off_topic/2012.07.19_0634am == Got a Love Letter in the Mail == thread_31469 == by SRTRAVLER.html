				So I got a love letter from customs and boarder patrol that was sent to my apartment. ( address wasnt even to my apartment number but straight to the front office)&nbsp; The letter said they found 6.1 grams of ketamine.&nbsp; The weird thing is, I never ordered&nbsp; 6 grams of ketamine.&nbsp; I had ten grams of mdma not make it to me and also a two one gram order of ketamine not making it.<br /><br />The letter gives me options,&nbsp; i can sign the paper and tell them its not mine or that i want it back and also it says if i do nothing it will just be confiscated.<br /><br />SO i alrdy moved out of that apartment. ( not for the love letter but cus my lease was up)<br /><br />Maybe they are trying to trick me and get me to sign some papers and send it back to them.&nbsp; yeh right,&nbsp; i aint signin no paper.&nbsp; fuck you government. <br /><br />Oh and i alrdy received five orders at the apartment after receiving&nbsp; the love letter from customs.&nbsp; Looks like my address is not on some &quot;list&quot;<br /><br />And one last thing,&nbsp; if this was a legitament letter form the real customs ( which it looks like it is)&nbsp; That means that dont come kicking down doors for small weight. in USA

				Out of curiosity was the letter sent with a stamp? Or pre-paid postage? I can&#039;t imagine customs using stamps, might be a tip off if it was a vendor scamming you or legit.

				it had no stamps.<br /><br />It looks legit.its like four pages long of options for me to take in order to incriminate my self.&nbsp; There is an options saying that i can try to get the product back by signing a paper and sending it back to them.&nbsp; I guess they think im some desperate drug addict.<br />&nbsp;<br />I dont understand why they would not send it to my apartment number.&nbsp; It has to be a vender trying to pump fear and let the front office know i order drugs, or this is legit.&nbsp; It looks very very legit to me.<br /><br />There is a chicago phone number and address on it and every thing.&nbsp; Even got a date stamped on the letter.<br /><br />What really opdd is that i never ordered 6 grams of ketamine,&nbsp; <br /><br />maybe it was a package with ketamine and mdma in it and they just tested the metamine and thought the mdma was ketamine .<br /><br />But the only seller i ordered from that had ketamine and mdma t the same time and didnt make it to me, i dont think he sent them in the same package.<br /><br />mayeb a vender is trying to get at me. i dunno, im not stressin over it though

				Yeah, first of all don&#039;t stress yourself<br />I&#039;m pretty sure mdma is a worse charge, and there&#039;s the possibility that your scamming vendor put k because he knew putting mdma would&#039;ve been unrealistic (as they would&#039;ve raided your house for that much)<br /><br />Who was this vendor? and what security do you use while browsing tor?<br />

				If it&#039;s real, just leave it. Don&#039;t respond or say anything. If they come after you again, then start to weigh your plans. The DEA/LEO have bigger fish to fry. <br /><br />If it&#039;s a seller that just wants to make you think it isn&#039;t coming, still just leave it. <br /><br />

				such an interesting post all around. from the love letter itself to the perplexing circumstances surrounding their interception.<br /><br />maybe customs was trying to let the owner of the property know what was up. did they open it too? <br /><br />i was thinking perhaps the mdma was cut with k or something and that just happened to produce a stronger signal during the identification process and appeared to be only k. <br /><br />or the vendor may have messed up, cause if above was true it should have been more than 6 g of k, right? maybe they spilled it, or skimmed some off the top for themselves.&nbsp; maybe they had a k order but included the packaging as weight or something and the ten g order of mdma was never sent or something. <br /><br />as you were thinking, dont fucking respond or sign nothin of course!&nbsp; the claim to get it back is if you think they incorrectly identified the item or like shouldnt have been confiscated... obviously not to try to get ones illegal drugs back<br /><br />be safe!

				I ordered ten grams of mdma, two grams of ketamine, and ten hits of lsd from mitonox from the netherlands. He told me he sent one package with 3 grams of mdma, another with 7 grams and the lsd in it as well, another package with 2 grams of ketamine, so 3 packages in all. None of them made it.&nbsp; Mitonox told me he really sent em, i got my money back for everything except like 50% on the lsd so, 75 out my pocket.&nbsp; I have since received a ten gram package and another 14g mdma package from schiz from the netherlands to that same apartment&nbsp; address.<br /><br />Interesting theories modest mouse. Too bad we will never know, eh...\<br /><br />As for the front office, they never opened the letter.&nbsp; They put it in my mailbox, they did not hand it to me, but when i went to the front office to pick up a package of san pedro and bridgesii cacti i bought off the internet, the guy actually asked me &quot;Are you having drugs sent to your address?&quot;&nbsp; He asked me this before they put the letter in my mail box, so I just stood there in front of him not saying anything for like 4 seconds and then i said &quot; sometimes&quot;&nbsp; He then interrupted me and said &quot;im asking because this box here says live plants, fragile.&nbsp; Are there marijuana plants in this box?&quot;&nbsp; I was thinking wtf wtf wtf.&nbsp; I said told him i dont even know how marijuana plants could survive in a box like this &quot;but these cacti here are hardy plants, they can make it alive to me in the mail&quot; i said...lol.&nbsp; So i showed him the cacti and he liked em and was amazed.&nbsp; I told him here are cultures that worship this cacti. <br /><br />Next day I get the letter in my mailbox, and I think to my self,&nbsp; That fucker.
