				Maybe a new forum category called &quot;High Time&quot; might be helpful. As I browse, I keep running into drugs I&#039;ve never heard of before. I have no idea what they are, what the high is like, what the characteristics and risks are or what the hangover or addiction potential is, etc. I&#039;ve found some of them on Wikipedia but they don&#039;t say much about these things. Harm Reduction doesn&#039;t really speak to these issues either and I wouldn&#039;t want to miss out on any great new fun stuff.

				Same here. I came on SR knowing exactly what I wanted, but I see all of these crazy alphabet soup drugs, 5-Meo-DPT, 6-APB, 2C-T-7 and all of that shit. I dunno what any of these things are but they look delicious

				I love drugs, and I love reading, but I really love reading about drugs! ;D I took a solid weekend off to just research the fuck out of every drug I could find when I first signed up, and it still wasn&#039;t enough. Even now I discover the existence of another drug that I&#039;ve never even heard of about every single week since becoming a member. Try browsing drugs-forum, erowid, shroomery, bluelight, dmt-nexus, wikipedia, and last of all keep an eye on the drug safety category and rumor mill category for trip reports. If you look hard enough, you can eventually find at least one good source on whatever drug your interest lies in.

				There are a lot of good info on erowid, bluelight and drug-forum, but you have to spend a lot of time reading:)

				I love erowid to get quick basic information on a new substance: common names, pics, legality, effects, dosages, etc. Then Bluelight and r/drugs or r/askdrugs on reddit is also a good place to get information from other people who can answer your questions after you&#039;ve done some research on your own.

Reddit has a ton of experiences and discussion about these things. 420chan is also an awesome place to visit for most mainstream drugs. :D

				For most of the &quot;alphabet soup&quot; psychedelic drugs, the books PiKHAL: Phenethylamines I Have known and Loved, and TiKHAL: Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved&quot; are really good information resources. They were written by Alexander Shulgin, the chemist that first synthesized most of those drugs. They have details about synthesizing each drug, dosages, and effects/trip reports. The man tried a LOT of psychedelics. You can read it online free, I believe I was on erowid when I was reading about 4-FMA and the 2-X family last week. Cool stuff.

				Mephedrone - I highly advise you try this! People on here know how much I love my Drone&nbsp; :P. M1 is also a drug that&#039;s nice, look for my trip report - Very detailed, I explained exactly how it made me feel. Order a gram of Lims pre-ban Drone and I guarantee it will blow your face off&nbsp; ;D
