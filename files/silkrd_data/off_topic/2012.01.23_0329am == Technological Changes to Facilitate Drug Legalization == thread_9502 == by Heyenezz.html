				I realize that new technologies often spark new social and political changes. For instance, birth control made it easier for women to work outside the home, while Internet file sharing made copyright laws more difficult to enforce. <br /><br />So, what technological changes would make drug legalization more likely?<br /><br />Here are some possible candidates that I&#039;ve thought up:<br /><br />1. Self-driving cars: People would worry less about intoxicated drivers.<br /><br />2. Addiction cures: If a cure for a certain addiction were found (e.g., coke), that might make that drug&#039;s legalization more likely. For instance, a New Scientist article reported on a drug that made mice drink less alcohol, and vaccines are being developed for a variety of drug addictions.<br /><br />3. More effective treatments for depression &amp; mental illness: Most drug abuse is caused by addicts (I mean &quot;abuse&quot; as in the drugs are being used irresponsibly, which is not to say drugs are always abused when used. In fact, drugs are rarely abused when used. A small minority of addicts are to blame for the bad rap drugs get). I think people become addicts because they are unhappy or self-medicating. If there were a cure for depression (e.g., google &quot;wireheading&quot;) this would probably significantly reduce drug addiction, and therefore open the public more towards legalization.<br /><br />4. Less harmful drug substitutes: If a safe replacement for say, xtc or coke were found, that might lower the use of that drug such that people are more willing to legalize those drugs whose could be replaced by safer alternatives.<br /><br />5. Non-addictive painkillers: These would make opiates easier to regulate since we wouldn&#039;t have to prescribe them for medical use and could therefore relegate opiates to strict, well-regulated settings. With the possibility of more effective regulation, people might be more open legalizing opiates.<br /><br />6. Proven medical/therapeutic uses of currently illegal drugs: People would be more open to legalizing a drug if it were shown to have medical use. This has happened to some extent in the case of marijuana and certain psychedelics.<br /><br />7. Greater economic productivity: People might become addicted because of the suffering resulting from poverty. If technology were to dramatically increase economic productivity such that poverty was rare, this might also reduce drug addiction and therefore open the public towards legalization.<br /><br />It really comes down to creating technologies that will encourage the public to legalize.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on this subject? Wha technology do you think would help legalization?<br /><br />&nbsp;

Corporate money plays a role, but the obstacle to legalization is the public&#039;s perception of legalization&#039;s potential consequences. Money matters, but politicians won&#039;t vote against what voters want if that means they vote for the other guy. Our policies are fucked up because of voters, less so because of money.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9502.msg87854#msg87854">Quote from: John Keats on January 23, 2012, 02:48 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry but you&#039;ve got your facts wrong too.

If they were less financially secure, it would make more, not less, sense for women to work outside the home because the additional income means there&#039;s greater financial secure.

There was a time when slavery was considered a necessary and unavoidable part of society while being legal everywhere. Now, slavery is illegal everywhere even if it&#039;s prohibition isn&#039;t perfectly enforced.

Less harmful drug substitutes: If a safe replacement for say, xtc or coke were found, that might lower the use of that drug such that people are more willing to legalize those drugs whose could be replaced by safer alternatives.&quot;<br />- possibly, there are &quot;safer&quot; compunds coming out all the time...but balance not...<br /><br />&quot;6.

				i really dont think most of your thoughts will change much at all.. THAT BEING SAID<br /><br />weed WILL be legal within 5 years.. 10 at most.. just a matter of time<br /><br />like you said, legit medical uses of drugs like MDMA and LSD may legalize a select few drugs someday.. but im not holding out hope.. decriminalize possibly.. <br /><br />the adjenda of a select few and the power held by them, make it extreemly hard to change anything. the amount of money being made by the prison system and the amount of money that will be lost by some companys like alcohol/beer, make it very hard for us..

I&#039;m not one to call people out but I just can&#039;t stand plain ignorance. &quot;Politicians won&#039;t vote against what voters want&quot;... WHAT!?!? Did you ever hear of The Patriot Act, SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, repeal of the Glass-Steigel Act, JUST TO NAME A FEW?!? Polls show that over 50% of the America public supports the legalization of marijuana, and more than 77% support medical marijuana. Our policies are fucked up because of the spineless bastards that we put into office who only look to get as much soft money as they can in exchange for their core values. The problem is the pervasive sense of corporations running our nation.<br /><br />You should do some research or go to college before you post shit like that. And don&#039;t believe me? One of the VARIOUS tactics that corporations, such as the military industrial complex, use is putting jobs in almost EVERY congressional district. Thus, if a congress member was to oppose a certain companies wishes, the company would simply move its factory elsewhere and the politician would lose approx 500 KEY votes. His/her opposition could lose him/her his seat at the upcoming election. Most congress members will do ANYTHING to keep their seats. FUCKED UP HUH?!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=9502.msg88684#msg88684">Quote from: Heyenezz on January 24, 2012, 04:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This doesn&#039;t make sense.

Before the 1960s, women had the stereotypical role of maintaining the home. There were literally no jobs available for women other than secretaries and elementary school teachers. Thus women had to marry young in order to ensure their financial security (or end up a hooker). The post-war era saw a huge influx of wealth which allowed parents to provide their children with more than ever before and thus women did not have to worry about their financial security from an early age. Accordingly women reassed their roles in traditional society, challenge the male dominance of all aspects of life, and thus emerged the &quot;strong&quot; woman of the 70s.<br /><br />If you had absolutely no money and no opportunity to find a &quot;career&quot;, you&#039;d be looking to find a wealthy husband/wife to provide for you (or else face a life of taking it in the ass by dirty mexicans).

				Legalizing drugs would be counterproductive for the government. They keep alcohol legal because it is a terrible drug and an inhibitor of just about everything productive. Drugs open peoples minds to the world around them(not all). Drugs create a free society that isn&#039;t dependent on the government. The politicians do not want you to make your own choices, they want the welfare state. And as mentioned earlier most of it boils down to money. The legalization of MJ/lsd/MDMA would destroy the pharmaceuticals profits. These three drugs have countless medical benefits. MDMA is pretty much a cure-all for PTSD ,MJ has countless benefits, and LSD has some crazy painkilling attributes. But how cheap is a hit of lsd as apposed to weeks of morphine drips? There is no money in legalizing drugs, just like there is no money in curing cancer.

				fun safe drugs will be discovered. no tolerance...no addiction,&nbsp; just used as often as coffee. a day will come when all will be revealed in the microworld of drug developement. theres a chemical reason for everything and an infinite number of molecules yet to be discovered. .......an opiate that reverses tolerance simultaneously in proportion to strength and duration. i see it happening.

				I believe we can hasten the process by introducing more and more newcomers to psychedelics.&nbsp; In real life,&nbsp; people see me as a clean and nice character devoted to healing and releasing the chains on people. (I love dosing people and have taken many peers&#039; DMT virginities :D ).&nbsp; Of course my state and country don&#039;t agree, but honestly fuck them.&nbsp; &nbsp;The more people are aware and immune to propaganda their methods will become futile as awareness spreads.&nbsp; &nbsp;
