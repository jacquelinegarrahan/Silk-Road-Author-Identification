				The movie is shit compared to the game. As for the game, all of them are great, my favorite is Hitman 2 cause of the amount of missions you get and the levels are great. If you really want to submerge yourself in the game and feel like a Hitman, you got to choose professional difficulty, very unforgiving and realistic just the way it should be, if you enjoy using your brain that is if not just go with whatever you feel comfortable with.<br /><br />Any Hitman fans out there that are worried about Absolution? That shit looks like SC:Conviction mixed with Batman.&nbsp;

				I don&#039;t know man. The movie looked pretty bland. They should&#039;ve just tried to make blood money into a film or something. :D&nbsp; &nbsp;IMHO Blood Money was the best of series. Polished game engine, great level and mission layout, sound was spectacular, and the general style of the game was on point. Give that one rip sometime if your haven&#039;t.<br /><br />-Cheers

				God, the fucking cheat codes were something else. So much fun! ;D Professional mode was on a whole different level though, but man does it make you feel accomplished. ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve spent so many hours on those games, they&#039;re legendary!

				Oh dude I loved those games, and the movie.<br /><br />I don&#039;t remember which game it was, but my favorite bit was where you had to kill a doctor, and you could choose to poison his drink or come up behind him and razor wire his neck. Back then the games were so open plan and realistic with so many choices, really game changing, literally!

For example the the Blood Money level &quot;Death of a Showman&quot; one can run in a waste everyone without being seen and beat the mission. Or by placing certain items in the right places you can have one target shoot the other target and then have a &quot;faulty&quot; chandelier fall on him. I was showed this method by a friend btw :D&nbsp; . It all depends on how much you are willing to put into each mission which dictates how hard the mission will be. This is what made the hitman games great.

				I loved Blood Money. My favorite mission by far was the one with the Heaven &amp; Hell nightclub.

				I get the feeling with the Lee Hong missions, the ONLY way is to be stealthy.&nbsp; If you take into account the sheer number of bodyguards and his location in general.<br />Or, has anyone done this on the fly???
