				I really enjoyed watching the recent Adam Curtis documentaries &quot;All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace&quot; about the way the idealistic dreams of social networking pioneers of a world regulated and stabilized by computer algorithms have been subverted. <br /><br />3 episodes. I had a different substance for each. I like to think of them as individually shaped thinking caps.

Those deals... they&#039;re just so good! A set of 36 knives for only $19.99? Oh, they bumped it up to 72 now... AND THE PRICE IS STILL THE SAME?!

				Family Guy<br />Flight of the Conchords (yes, it&#039;s spelled correctly)<br />Entourage (yeah I know, a guilty pleasure)<br />Anything about nature and space<br />A decent movie with a decent story. Nothing too Hollywood as it&#039;s all so bland. I mean real stories with believable characters<br />Music Biographies like story of the Stones, Led Zep that sort of thing<br />Filmed live concerts of decent bands<br /><br />Detest any reality TV. Can&#039;t be dealing with sob story after sob story.
