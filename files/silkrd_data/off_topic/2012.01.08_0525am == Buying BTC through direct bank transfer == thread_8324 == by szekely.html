				Newbie here. Is it necessary for small buyers to buy their bitcoins totally anonymously, or does bitcoin by its nature provide sufficient security that it&#039;s ok to buy small amounts (&lt;100 USD) of bitcoins in ways that could theoretically be traced? I&#039;m asking because some exchanges like CAVIRTEX let you buy bitcoins via a direct online deposit from your bank account and this would be simpler than a cash deposit at the bank (in which case your face would also be recorded in security cameras).<br /><br />Obviously the direct deposit is less anonymous, but for a person who&#039;s only making small purchases of bitcoins and is not selling any products here, I can&#039;t imagine it would really be a security risk. I mean, buying bitcoins is perfectly legal and legitimate, and bitcoin itself provides a good deal of security that LE would have enough trouble tracing for a large seller, let alone a person making relatively insignificant transactions that they really don&#039;t care too much about. Anybody bought bought BTC this way?

				You know, everyone&#039;s tolerance for risk is different, and a bank deposit is high on my richter scale for unsafe practices.<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking to do your first purchase, and it&#039;s for a low amount, use one of the reputable vendors on SR that take MPs for BTC.&nbsp; It&#039;ll cost you an extra 20%, but that only comes out to around $20 or $30, and that&#039;s a pretty cheap learning experience.&nbsp; Plus, you&#039;ll get the feedback, and there&#039;s practically no way to trace it back to you; all they would see is that a BTC entered the SR system before you got there (the vendors are most likely using an SR wallet, which is why the transfers go quick) and you send them to another SR member (within the SR network).<br /><br />To answer your question directly, you have lots of options.&nbsp; Both https://get-bitcoin.com/ and https://intersango.com/ seem good, and both take bank deposits (which I would never do).<br /><br />I recommend you ease in to it.&nbsp; Save a few 1/10&#039;s of a BTC, open some accounts, and transfer them around a little.&nbsp; Find a vendor you trust.&nbsp; Find a product you like.&nbsp; In a month from now, assess how it&#039;s going, and adjust.

				If the customer buys bitcoins through bank transfer and then buys XX off a seller then the only people who know your wallet address are the exchanger and the seller?<br /><br />So as long as seller is trustworthy then it should be fine but then again if there not trustworthy then I don&#039;t think you should be sending them your address nevermind bitcoins.<br /><br />Bouncing your bit coins through a few few different wallets couldn&#039;t hurt but is it really helping at all?<br />
