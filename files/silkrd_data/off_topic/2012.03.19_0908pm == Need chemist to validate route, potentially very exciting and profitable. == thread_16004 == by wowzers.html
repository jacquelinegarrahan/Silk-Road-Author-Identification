				Helional to MDP2P in 2 easy and practical steps. Contact me on erpland@tormail.net if interested, I need someone to validate this before releasing it to the world. <br /><br />**If you have even a passing interest in these things, you&#039;ll realise how exciting this is if it works!

				This is not my area, but I think he is talking about a new route to make mdma. Actually, a new route to make MDP2P, which you use to make MDMA.<br /><br />The route I read is:<br />Safrole (sassafras oil)-&gt;MDP2P-&gt;MDMA oil-&gt; MDMA<br /><br />Dopeboy posted a thread about making MDA from hellional, but you don&#039;t need to make MDP2P to make MDA.<br /><br />If you get MDP2P from hellional, you can make MDMA from it.<br /><br />Probably hellional is easy to get than sassafras oil in his area (not my case), or it is simpler to work with, or produces bigger yields.

				hellional is easy to purchase in large quantities. I&#039;m talking barrels full no problem. Safrole is a little harder to buy especially in large&nbsp; quantities.<br /><br />Once this method is complete will you be selling it on SR?

				I&#039;m not a chemist, so I&#039;m not here to say &quot;it&#039;s impossible&quot;, buuuuuuuuuuut...<br /><br />With all the respect, nobody never ever thought about this route? When somebody tells me he is planning to do something revolutionary about a subject I don&#039;t know very well, this question just appear in my mind. Sometimes the person is so exciting about the new idea that he just does not see the obstacles. Why nobody never thought about. If somebody thought, why he could not finish the idea? And why with you will be different.<br /><br />One more time, I&#039;m not here to confront you as a chemist, because I don&#039;t have any knowledge to do that. I appreciate your initiative and I give my best wish to success. I understand that sometimes good ideas just born (like the falling apple and the law of gravity) and the obstacles are just overcome (like facebook or even silkroad) with new ideas.<br /><br />But I needed to make this questions...
