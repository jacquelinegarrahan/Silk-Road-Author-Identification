				what&#039;s the best value for buying smack to the UK SR buyers? taking into account price, weight, quality. also delivery time could be a factor as it kinda fucks up the value if your gear is late and you got to go buy on the street for two days while you wait for it.<br /><br />i&#039;ve been buying a few .2s from uglydoll lately. the gear is good, nothing you could complain about, and at only Â£12 its one of the cheaper deals on sr that i&#039;ve found. does take a few days to get here tho and they only ship at weekends which is kinda odd, but apart from that is one of the better offers i&#039;ve seen.

				Uglydoll&#039;s #3 is ok but took 1 week to process my order then another week to deliver granted i am in australia but that has nothing to do with them sending it. Strength wise was alright but had better but it is cheap <br /><br />Now there is Aussie vendor who has just started international sales ozexpress now granted its a little pricy but i garantee bang for buck its #4 so i dont know if you IV or smoke but oz&#039;s IVed .05 had me nicely fucked up and .1 almost killed my IRL dealer
