				Just keep thinking that every package you ship makes someone happy after the wait.<br />I was already paranoid this morning with several outstanding orders way past the usual shipping time...and then I open my mailbox today and pick 2 drugs I have not had in ages, both outstanding quality.<br />It is a joy to see the power of innovation that goes into stealth packaging with so many vendors. <br /><br />It is people like you who help spreading a vertical system of meds/drugs distribution that leads to better quality - I am amazed about the purity I can buy on SR - and better prices as this is the ultimate libertarian market which may once be seen as the turning point of our failing economic system.<br />
