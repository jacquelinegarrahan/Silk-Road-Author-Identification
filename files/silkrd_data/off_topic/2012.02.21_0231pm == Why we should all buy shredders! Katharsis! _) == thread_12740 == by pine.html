				I bought a shredder a couple of months back, and never got an opportunity to use it so far.<br /><br />Then, today I gathered all my SR related paperwork and zoomed it through the machine.<br /><br />Business never felt so cathartic! <br /><br />Seriously, try it! It&#039;s not just more professional, it&#039;s practically therapeutic! :)

				Spooky - I just purchased a cross cut shredder only a couple of minutes before reading this thread...I think the universe is reinforcing my good decision...<br /><br />...or I&#039;m just really stoned!

I couldn&#039;t do that. My house would look like an embassy in wartime (they burn all their shit really quickly with special procedure).<br /><br />I have a lot of hardcopy because I prefer to study our market that way. But no sensitive data that could be called evidence, that&#039;s all hardware isolated encrypted stuff.<br /><br />I&#039;m wired today. I read in the last twelve hours, every single post in the Shipping Forum from start to finish. (for my book) LOL! Silk Road is my job and my hobby in one at this point.

In the city where I have lived for the past dozen years, I was one of the very first identity fraud cases.<br /><br />Court dates. Jail time. Attorney Fees. Fines. Missed time at work. A complete NIGHTMARE!<br /><br />As soon as I got everything settled, I went to an office supply store to purchase a shredder. Now mind you, I already had a shredder during the ordeal. I was so heated that my information had been compromised, I upgraded to the confetti, cross cut shredder! Everything that came in my mailbox, I gathered at the end of each week, sat down to my favorite tunes, and I shredded until there was no paper in the house. THEN, I would bag it up and set it on fire...<br /><br />I have been telling people for years, the most important appliance in your home is a shredder. It&#039;s not better than sex, but it&#039;s great foreplay.
