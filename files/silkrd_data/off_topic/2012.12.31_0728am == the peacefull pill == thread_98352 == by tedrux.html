				If you want it to be pleasant, I&#039;d advise not going with Cyanide. Nembutal, a Darvon Cocktail, or a large quantity of pretty much any Barbiturate or Opiate (Morphine pills especially) would probably be a pretty peaceful way to go out. There&#039;s also the Helium Hood or Hibachi methods. Using a Helium Hood in addition to a lethal drug quantity would be pretty fail safe, since even if the drugs simply knocked you out, the hood would counteract the body&#039;s natural reaction to breathe while unconscious. The Hibachi involves lighting a few small charcoal grills in a small and sealed off space. You could also try making a mask and attaching it to a Carbon Monoxide tank. I&#039;ve provided a link below for the tank method. Personally I&#039;d just go with the Hood/Drug combo if you&#039;re serious, since the Hibachi and Tank methods could potentially kill whoever discovers your corpse. I sincerely hope you take more time to think this through, I was in your shoes six months ago, coming to the Road was part of what helped me. If you must go through with this, go in peace and best of luck to you. <br /><br />http://www.jerryhunt.org/kill.htm

				RE thinking it through further: I have had a preoccupation with suicide for pretty much my whole life; almost as if it was meant to be. It is though in the past two years since she threw me away like garbage that I have decided that there is no going back; I&#039;ve simply seen too much of the truth to go back now. I&#039;ve seen myself for the piece of shit I am and seen how I can&#039;t change even with something I actually care about on the table to lose. I was pretty sure that its what I wanted to do since the day I started smoking or I wouldn&#039;t have started. I was dead the moment she said &quot;I FUCKING HATE YOU&quot;. <br /><br />In RE to callling me retarded and Emo- I could cop to either and if you despise people like that then why have reservations about allowing them to be self absolving? Doesn&#039;t seem to make sense. If your so convinced human life is sacred there is ONE way to save my life and fuck no I&#039;m not volunteering the info- that&#039;d just be too easy. Besides I don&#039;t believe that it&#039;s possible anyways. god knows I already tried. <br /><br />Thank you for the compassion and consideration<br />tell me: if you had to go out, how would you want to do it?

				Well lets look at that shall we, what are your goals? The sources for all that I listed are very easy to come by, the method is true and tested and will definitely kill you, if your serious you can find the sources, along with information on the method. But lets talk about your low self esteem and the view you have that people don&#039;t want you around.

That&#039;s not reason enough to kill yourself. You promised a girl you would kill yourself and that would make her happy? what the FUCK?&nbsp; Thats depression and misery talking- YOU have to fight it. and fuck her, she aint worth it, maybe your expectations are too high.<br /><br />As someone who attempted suicide over a girl at age 13(stupid, probably attn wanting, was also on ZOLOFT) - still alone and helpless at 25- but I KNOW that a girl is no reason to end your life. You have got to hold onto that hope that things will get better , OR GO OUT AND MAKE THEM BETTER(I know nobody wants to hear this and its not easy by any means)<br /><br />Surrounding circumstances involving a girl and a friend of mine ended up causing him to drive off in the middle of the night and kill himself(wasnt wearing seatbelt, drove into stone wall)- this just happened a week before Christmas. It was so tragic and sad to see his life end. Not only for me personally but really for his family and close friends. He was a good one even though he may have said the same things you said while he was alive, and some people did not like him. He had a good heart, but the female essentially killed him just like she is trying to do to you.<br /><br />I know how you feel like you wont change, and nothing will change. But that is selfish thinking. Think of others, your family, friends, partners, whatever. You said you got several girls?? Lucky bastard, go hang out with them. I wish I had a girl that gave me the time of day.(well there might be some- but they aint worth it!)<br /><br />I hope things get better and you see the quality in life. I dont know your drug history but shrooms helped me &quot;see&quot; there was more to life. and remember. there&#039;s always someone that has it worse than you.
