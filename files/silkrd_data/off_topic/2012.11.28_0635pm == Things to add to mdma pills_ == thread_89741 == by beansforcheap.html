				Can people give me ideas on what to press with mdma to make them a little more speedy besides actual speed.

				Mix 75mg&#039;s of MDA with 100mg&#039;s of MDMA.<br />It adds a speedy effect to the roll as well as a trippy, psychedelic feel. It&#039;s very nice indeed. :)

				Speed is like dirt cheap on SR? Arguably the cheapest drug on the road. <br />If you want to make bitchin e pills forget mdma all together, Meth + ketamine is an amazing party roll<br />But if you really want to just add some meth to the pills. Dance all night, amazing euphoria, people will love it

				Im in the u.s.a so the only speed here is meth but its too expensive to press into pills imo and so is mephedrone. But 4mec sounds good. Mda is too expensive im looking to save some money and still add pep to it how about caffeine?

				If you&#039;re trying to be dishonest and cut your MDMA to make more money you can figure it out yourself. There is no such thing as &quot;too much money&quot;. I answered your question. Caffeine and other bulking agents or cuts is dishonest, especially if you&#039;re too cheap to get some actual additions like methamphetamine or MDA, which a professional roller would use. Not some petty DMAA, or caffeine, or ephedrine, 4mec, M1, etc. <br /><br />

				I always liked making mental caps:<br /><br />150mg mdma<br />2 drops of liquid<br />200mg ketamine<br />100mg ice<br /><br />Top it off with Don Julio and Dry and you have a fine evening ahead :)<br /><br />mdma + mda is also a nice combo, although was never sure about the percentages as I wasn&#039;t the one who made them.

				Yeah, but my main products are plain MDMA and MDA caps. Every one of the mixes has the ingredients listed. The MDxx line is experimental. You&#039;re the one who&#039;s hating because he&#039;s broke and has to cut his MDMA. <br /><br />&nbsp;8)

				&quot;Mixed Rolls&quot; and anything pressed with any other substances other than MDMA (and binding agents) are called &quot;Mints&quot; where I&#039;m at. Most people sell mints around here which I&#039;ve heard can contain MDMA + anything from meth to ketamine to caffeine and God knows what else. Sometimes not even MDMA at all, which is disheartening, but pure/clean shit is pretty hard to find on the streets. Every mother&#039;s son is looking to make a few bucks by means of cutting or substituting.<br /><br />A pressed &quot;roll&quot; to me is a pill that has only MDMA as the active substance. Buying locally, these are rare and are one of the main reasons I use Silk Road.<br /><br />As far as what you should put in yours....... A friend willingly tested a 100mg MDMA and ~50mg 6-APB (analogue of MDA) capsule I made for him and really liked it. He said the 6-APB made the come-up a little quicker and the overall experience more psychedelic comparable to a mushroom-like trip, for a very positive experience.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t checked prices on 6-APB, I got mine on sale awhile back.<br />

				Interesting around here:<br /><br />mints = any pressed pill, containing anything, usually not MDMA<br />molly = MDMA<br />sass = MDA<br />&quot;roll&quot; = MDxx + something else also can be known as a flip.

				if your getting real mints, aka chicago mints, they are pure mdma with a inert agent to help it be pressed. they are made by the polish mafia and the only real commercial domestic pills i know of being made in the US.

				Chicago is full of Polish people.<br /><br />And brand name on pills means nothing. Batches are copied all the time. Brands are copied, fakes are made. You can&#039;t tell what&#039;s in a pill without a reagent test. If you&#039;re going by hearsay on the provenance of the pill instead of a reagent or lab test then you aren&#039;t doing it right. <br /><br />My buddy gets mints from Chicago, or that&#039;s at least what he says and they generally suck. If you&#039;re lucky you&#039;ll get 80-100mg of MDMA + something in one. &quot;Skittle packs&quot; are popular around here a.k.a. mixed batches. I don&#039;t see why considering that makes making comparisons more difficult.

				I just wanna know if the mints have anything else in them besides mdma because some people say they do and some people say they dont. Im sure there only 75mg though. I would have thought that they got sent to edata but i guess nobody wants to send one in if i could get mints i would send one to edata immediatly.

				From my experience with &quot;mints&quot; or &quot;mixed pills,&quot; I would say that yes, they do contain MDMA, but very little of it. Some are more powerful than others, but the general consensus amongst my raver friends is that you will need multiple &quot;mints&quot; to achieve an intense experience. Personally, I&#039;ve taken 4 &quot;Mints&quot; at one concert, not at the same time though, and had an awesome time, but they obviously were not pure MDMA. If they were, I would have been floored and the experience would&#039;ve been too intense.<br /><br />&quot;Mints&quot; or &quot;Mixed Rolls&quot; generally just look shady. Most examples&nbsp; I&#039;ve encountered are very small, crumbly, inconsistant color, vague/light imprints/symbols on them. A local source has even told me that the color of the &quot;mint&quot; determines what other additives are in them, i.e. Blue = ketamine, pink = amphetamines, etc.<br /><br />However, I&#039;ve taken 2 other &quot;mints&quot; and had a time comparable to the one mentioned above. So I feel it is impossible to make a solid generalization of &quot;mints&quot; or &quot;mixed rolls&quot; as it depends what the contents are. <br /><br />From my experience with Silk Road products including pills and MDMA, they generally leave you a bit more &quot;chilled out&quot; rather than highly energized. However, I&#039;ve also had times where I was jumping/dancing around for a couple of hours. It depends on the batch, and person, because everybody reacts to the stuff differently.<br /><br />Its really a shady business buying anything deemed &quot;ecstasy&quot; locally, so sources like pillreports should be used to confirm you aren&#039;t taking a meth-based heroin LSD tab. I&#039;ve heard crazy shit about from friends buying shit at concerts and tripping the fuck out, its sketchy shit. Silk Road offers safe pure MDMA pills for the most part, and I&#039;m sticking to those and MDMA from there as well. I&#039;m sure it wouldn&#039;t hurt to mix in a small amount of stimulant, as potent as meth or as minor as caffeine to &quot;keep you going&quot; rather than be &quot;floored.&quot;<br /><br />Sleeping and the &quot;hangover&quot; are also factors I seem to notice amongst MDMA usage. Most silk road products have allowed me to sleep without any issues. Some of the mints/local shit often leaves me lying in bed trying to sleep, or just not getting good sleep. The day after, some pure stuff has a bit of an afterglow, with positive vibes occurring the follwing day after consumption, while local shit or mints leave me a little depressed/mentally exhausted. I suspect amphetamines to be the cause of that.<br /><br />Its a toss up, and depending where you&#039;re from, terminology varies a lot. Its interesting to see all the different slang and shit, almost kinda weird too. Especially if I were to travel to other countries/regions and attempt to acquire &quot;ecstasy.&quot;<br /><br />Diversity friends, Diversity indeed.

				It&#039;s very easy to tell what is in a pill dancesafe.org sells a reagent trio pack for about $50. <br /><br />Split a pill into pieces, perform each test on it. <br /><br />Note results.

DO NOT add methamphetamine to pills and then sell them as mdma or combinations of both. The fact you are even making a thread like this means you are fucking clueless to the actual interactions these extra additives will have with each other inside someones body. Molly is ridiculously cheap on here and if you need to dumb it down to make an extra buck then jog right on. If this was for personal use, then that&#039;s fine, but you are clearly pressing pills for profit. Do your customers a favor and at the least just press lower milligram content pills so you have a higher yield but still supplying an uncut product. The only additive I agree with is MDA and that will only increase your costs, however, the roll will be extremely better.&nbsp;

				I disagree. I believe a roll, like anything else can be customized, and if you&#039;re honest about what it contains then there isn&#039;t an issue. For example I have a MDMA/MDA/cocaine/methamphetamine pill I made. Is it ridiculous, yes. But dude, it&#039;s a Jeffrey.

In saying that though, just because they &#039;know&#039; what they are about to consume does not necessarily mean they know the ramifications of poly drug use, which can be seriously toxic. If they were to drink after consuming one of your custom pills then the cocaine will react with the alcohol to produce cocaethylene which is toxic. I also recall reading somewhere that cocaine actually blocks the receptors which release serotonin, effectively cancelling out the main effect of mdma (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) so they are wasting their $ in that regard. I guess I&#039;m a little more concerned than others when it comes to harm reduction, but you can never be to careful.&nbsp; &nbsp;
