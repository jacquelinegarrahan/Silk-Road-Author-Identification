				Hi guys.<br /><br />I just sent a message out to all my buyers with outstanding orders, but I also wanted to let any prospective customers know the situation with my BC Cyanescens.<br /><br />I was supposed to have my supplier stop by about 2 hours ago with my latest batch to fill the orders I haven&#039;t shipped yet, plus restock for F2F and future orders on here.&nbsp; Unfortunately he has had a pretty serious family emergency and was already out of town by the time he got a hold of me.&nbsp; As of right now I am completely bone-dry out of Cyanescens.<br /><br />He thinks it will be a few days until he is back but isn&#039;t sure and I haven&#039;t talked to him since he was still on the way to his family.&nbsp; I&#039;m hoping I get an update here fairly soon, so I can get a better picture of what to do.&nbsp; If you are one of my buyers and read this before the message I sent out, you can cancel the order if you like.&nbsp; If you feel like holding on I will make sure you are compensated with some extra product for the trouble.<br /><br />In the meantime I have pulled all of my cyans listings, and I just wanted to mitigate the head-scratching if someone toured by my profile page and saw the listings for mushrooms gone.<br /><br />I am still fully stocked with bud, though, so feel free to order! :)<br /><br />Anarcho47
