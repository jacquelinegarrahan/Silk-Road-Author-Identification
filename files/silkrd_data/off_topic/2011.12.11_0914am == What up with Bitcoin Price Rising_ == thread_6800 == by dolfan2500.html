				this happens every mo or 2. what i think it is someone with money is buying a ton of coins to make the cost go up. then ppl see it going up thinking i better buy at the same time the 1st buy wait for a bit then when we think the time is right he sell all the coins he got. so at the same time all these ppl go yea a way for me to make money he sell them the coin he got to make it go up. then with all the coins he just sold makes it go back to what it was or a bit lower.

				&quot;Why is Bitcoin Market necessary?<br /><br />Like all currencies and commodities, the value of Bitcoins will fluctuate over time as supply and demand change. This market facilitates a real-time Bitcoin-to-USD exchange rate. Bitcoin Market DOES NOT CREATE the exchange rate or the issuance of new Bitcoins. It is to bring Bitcoin traders together. The traders&#039; actions will determine the exchange rate. The issuance of new Bitcoins is an altogether separate matter determined by the Bitcoin program.&quot;<br />

				Bitcoins are too volatile for me.&nbsp; In the course of a message composition it can fluctuate a dime or more USD.&nbsp; I keep my cash parked in USD until the second before I purchase on SR before exchanging to BTCs via TradeHill.&nbsp;

				I suspect they&#039;ll go back down after New Years when the demand goes back down. Buy now, sell at the end of December, and make some money if you&#039;re lucky. I agree it&#039;s too volatile for a stable market. It&#039;s like paying with stock where value can go up or down a lot in just a few hours. I only get my money right before buying and spend it all within a day or two.

A very high demand right now for New Years. I believe I will stick with them and see where it goes. I bought the sellers account at 3.44perBTC a month or more ago. It is just getting back to that market now. Thanks for everyones answers. Lets try to keep this thread going if anyone else has anything to say. I believe all points are covered though.

				BTC prices rise and fall like any other floating currency, based on supply and demand. Similar to stock price or ForEX Prices. The christmas demand is likely increasing the price.

				Thanks everyone for commenting on this thread i started.&nbsp; I do the samething as some of you guys.&nbsp; I wait untill im ready to make another purchase and i go to the bank, deposit my cash and get my bitcoins.&nbsp; Then as soon as their in my SR account I buy whatever it is that i want at the time.&nbsp; Got a question for ya, has anyone used that new guy on SR thats selling BTC for the moneypaks? I cant remember his name but its only a few days old?&nbsp; Because I would like to try it so I could get my BTC alittle faster for once.&nbsp; I know you can get bitcoins fast and safe but not fast and safe at the sametime lol.

				Seems to me that because bitcoins are released slower and slower over time, and I see no reason whatsoever for demand to drop, that the prices would HAVE to rise over time...

Supply and Demand usually Do Not Impact Currencies. Like The U.S. Dollar, which is a Note, can appear from thin air, so do BC&#039;s. Many Moons ago I used to Trade Paper. I&#039;m very familiar with Patterns. I&#039;m very big into what is know as Kondroitiv Wave Theory. Basically, If Stalin had not Executed Kondroitiv, he would have received a Nobel Peace Prize. anyway, if you look at the recent Trend Of BC&#039;s, you will see that Twice, BC&#039;s broke through 3.11. This is called a Head &amp; Shoulders Pattern. The great thing here is that there was a 3rd Attack past 3.11 and it made it! This is great news! Usually when you see a pattern like this, you can affirm that 3rd Try is The Charm. If I were me, I would buy as Many BC&#039;s right now as I can. Try not to spend too many as I really feel BC will travel further up. Add to that, let&#039;s just say on a Particular Date, close time range, everyone of like mindedness Bought BC&#039;s. Be it 1 or 10 or 100 Bc&#039;s. That would bust BC&#039;s Nutz and who knows how far BC could go. If you want to get fancy, you can use CampBx, which allows you to Buy on Margin and Execute &quot;Limit Orders.&quot; Granted, unless you know what your doing, I wouldnt dabble too much. Good Luck to All!

Set Time Period default at 10 days and Hourly, Chart Type at Median Price, and set Price Brand at Envelope SMA (moving Average) and as you look at The wave, you&#039;ll Note a true Correction will occur when BC breaks under 3.40. The New Break Out Upwards is 4.90. If it Breaks out of 4.90 then BC will be all over map but will continue trend higher based on the wave that is Sinusoid. Then repeats itself hopefully trending upwards

				BTC is not a stock and is a very cruel byiotch. Bitcoin cares NOTHING for you and she NEVER will. She&#039;s a wild one not to be taken lightly.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen $18 each and I&#039;ve seen $3 and less each. With every twist and dip in between. Her mood and mind change very often. IF you can make a buck, do it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been on both sides and the down really sucks. When to cut expected losses and real losses? Sell at $12.. No wait, $11.35 BTC will go back up, I just know it. Famous second to last words. Followed by swearing.&nbsp; All the sudden bitcoin is at $8 and you don&#039;t know what to do. So you sell. BTC shoots back up to $10 and you kick yourself and swear. 3 days later btc in the gutter at $4 and falling. Now you dont feel so bad. BUT STILL think about $10+. That is a stressful ordeal!!! Sell and make your money while the money is there to get. You could almost always do better or worse after the fact. But you have to do something. SELL and get that money.&nbsp; :D
