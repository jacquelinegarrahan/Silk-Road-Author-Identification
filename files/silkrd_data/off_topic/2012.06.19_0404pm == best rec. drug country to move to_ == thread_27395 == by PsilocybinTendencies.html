				Portugal has very lax drug laws. They do heroin in the middle of the streets and I was offered to buy coke by 2 different people in my hotel in Lisbon. Apparently if you&#039;re caught with a small amount then your drugs are confiscated and you have to go talk to a drug counselor of sorts, maybe a small fine, but the counselors are more concerned about if your safely using than the fact your using since HIV is at incredibly high rates in the country.

				That&#039;s the only decent choice I know of, and from what I hear they are starting to pass retarded laws over there too. <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe we are in the 21st century and there is still not a single country in the world with a logical approach to the drug problem. (Recognizing that it isn&#039;t a problem)

				If I moved to the Netherlands, drugs would be the last of my problems. Window shopping for prostitutes is something I could easily become addicted to. It&#039;s a &#039;hobby&#039; for me now, with the advent of review sites like TER (TheEroticReview) but being able to view the wares beforehand... Yea, I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;d be able to afford drugs at that point.

				If you live in the USA moving to Canada would be easy, no culture shock or anything. Van city is really lib when it comes to drugs, most canadian vendors are from their and its really easy to get anything just take a walk through hastings and weed is really cheap, a day of searching and you can find high quality bc bud for 200/ounce.<br />Moving to europe would be difficult work wise considering English is usually not the first language in a lot of lines of work. If your in Business type stuff you will be fine but say you work at a factory or something not speaking the native language could be a problem.

				Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that language is would be a major issue in Spain. You&#039;ll have to learn Spanish, very few people speak ANY English, you&#039;ll even struggle just to pay for your train ticket, when the operator tells you how much you have to pay...

India and parts of south east asia can be great for hash/weed/pharms/opium whereas you&#039;ll get the biggest selection in Holland. 1-2 KW weed growing in the Czech Republic is no longer a criminal offense but other drugs of any quality are hard to find. Holland is much more pricey compared to India/Asia, it is also quite a strange culture to get used to compared to other European countries. Dutch vulture is not really the kind of culture a foreign recreational drug user would be attracted to (unless you stay firmly in the cosmopolitan Amsterdam scene, which can get annoying). Portugal/Spain are in very serious financial straits and this effects the general mood a lot.

Any major city will also have plenty of street dealers. Or take a bus/train/jeep up north from Delhi into the Himalaya towns and there will be plenty there as well. The government shops could be a good starting place at least, although the quality from such outlets is never particularly good...loitering around the shops however maybe some interesting characters who have better wares to offer you. You can buy great little weed bonbons from these shops as well but be careful with the bhang lassi (weed yoghurt drink), last time I drank one in a restaurant in Varanasi I had to go back to my hotel and literally hide under the covers. Way too strong for unsuspecting me.

I don&#039;t blame Indians for wanting to live in the west but the truth is India is starting to shine and America/EU are starting to really suffer. An expat in India can easily find nice places to live with good infrastructure and a booming economy. Of course life at the lower end is still tough.
