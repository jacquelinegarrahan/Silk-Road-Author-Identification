				Hey guys I wanted to start this thread up because well I want to see how we men (and ladies) spit &quot;game&quot;. Also, not going to lie and I am sure I am not the only one who wants to improve his &quot;game&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />So before we go on I might as well explain my situation also, maybe I can get some advice as well. Ok I am 22 and I was with my now ex-wife since I was literally 5 and we got divorced (by that I mean I was deployed in the military and she had affairs) when I was 20 and it took me no joke two years to get over her. I could not look at another woman in a sexual way not even adult material. So around June I said to myself enough is enough I am done crying I want to go out and meet other girls. So my friends and I have been going out a few times a month. So far since June I&#039;ve gotten 2 hummers and I&#039;ve made out with a few girls on the dance floor, not going to lie they were all 5&#039;s and below. I working on my self confidence and I consider myself and have been told by hot girls that I am very cute. So before I get into my approach let me explain part of me. I am from Liverpool, UK so I am a Scouser and I have a thick accent, I live in America so it appears to be an advantage. Ok so here is my approach, First I go to the club with my mates and we will get drinks and what not to get loose and then my one mate wall hugs and me and my other mate normally hit the dance floor and try to talk to girls (maybe mistake number 1 I am out looking for a girl?). I&#039;ll normally dance around a group normally 3-4 and then inch closer and closer and try to start normal conversation once I meet a girl I introduce myself, I&#039;ll kiss the top of her hand. Normally I get this &quot;OMG where are you from&quot; that to me is sign that she is interest, and they normally grab my hand or&nbsp; right arm which is fully sleeved so another conversation starter there. Then i grab them by the hip and pull em in and we dance, but lately like the last 3 times out I&#039;ve been getting shot down like I&#039;ll dance with a girl or two but nothing really escalates.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be honest I&#039;ve only been with one girl my whole life and I have no idea how to talk to them <br /><br /><br />So thats my approach I figured, I&#039;d be completely honest and ask for all criticisms and advice&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				A big secret about meeting women is they find cum irresistible. When you are going out to the club make sure you put cum all over your face and hands and stuff and when you get near them it will drive them wild.&nbsp; Also keep some extra in a condom stuffed in your pocket in case you need reserves for her.

				learn to love yourself and your own company 1st, then when you are ready get to know as many women as you can, women are great, funny smart and good company, get some female friends, be confident ( acting confident can be the same as being confident. ) find a girl you like and ask her out, if she says no make her laugh then ask her out again. remember to wash your balls.

				Sounds like you&#039;re full of confidence and the method you were using was working for a while but the last three haven&#039;t so maybe give that same method another few goes and if none of the next five attempts work then you must have changed something that has made it not work? If you haven&#039;t changed anything then you&#039;ll have to come up with another approach if none of the next five work I&#039;d say!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Ok I know this is going to sound out there but seeing as you have access to a computer, seem to be able to construct sentences maybe try a online dating site, atleast you can talk to women before meeting them and there seems to be alot of women these days who prefer to meet online first as when they are out with their friends they&nbsp; dont wont to be hit on but thats just my .02c

So my friends and I have been going out a few times a month. So far since June I&#039;ve gotten 2 hummers and I&#039;ve made out with a few girls on the dance floor, not going to lie they were all 5&#039;s and below. I working on my self confidence and I consider myself and have been told by hot girls that I am very cute. So before I get into my approach let me explain part of me. I am from Liverpool, UK so I am a Scouser and I have a thick accent, I live in America so it appears to be an advantage. Ok so here is my approach, First I go to the club with my mates and we will get drinks and what not to get loose and then my one mate wall hugs and me and my other mate normally hit the dance floor and try to talk to girls (maybe mistake number 1 I am out looking for a girl?). I&#039;ll normally dance around a group normally 3-4 and then inch closer and closer and try to start normal conversation once I meet a girl I introduce myself, I&#039;ll kiss the top of her hand. Normally I get this &quot;OMG where are you from&quot; that to me is sign that she is interest, and they normally grab my hand or&nbsp; right arm which is fully sleeved so another conversation starter there. Then i grab them by the hip and pull em in and we dance, but lately like the last 3 times out I&#039;ve been getting shot down like I&#039;ll dance with a girl or two but nothing really escalates.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be honest I&#039;ve only been with one girl my whole life and I have no idea how to talk to them <br /><br /><br />So thats my approach I figured, I&#039;d be completely honest and ask for all criticisms and advice&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You were pussy whipped early, pure and simple. Married at 22? Ok, i&#039;m going to sound mean here, but in my eyes, too many people are getting married and having children before they even know who they are themselves....<br /><br />Having a family,being married and joining the military is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to a family.<br /><br />Are you a family man, or a fighter? Sorry you can&#039;t have both. I&#039;ve had a few whipped friends from years ago, married early 20&#039;s, divorced now.<br /><br />If you really loved her, you would not have deployed, simple.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree about the whipped comment, Go fuck yourself about deploying I do what I have to do. If I didn&#039;t go with my delpoyment I would have gone to jail

				Mary666 and I are certified SR Fembots as incubusdriver clearly pointed out lol.<br /><br />Honestly? Unless you are really attractive I really don&#039;t pay much attention to guys I don&#039;t know at clubs. I generally stick to my friends. Try meeting girls in non alcoholic settings. For example, if I guy I physically consider to be a 7-ish approaches me in a club he would probably get rejected if he somehow manages to get through my friends; we act as guardians to each other. On the other hand, if the same guy were to approach me while I was at a museum, or park, or even in the mall, his odds of ACTUALLY meeting me and exchanging numbers would go up significantly. A thing that a friend has done and quite well is a thing called Events and Adventures, it is an event organization where they have outings available almost every day of every month and everyone that goes is single. This would also be a good opportunity for you to meet girls. <br /><br />Bottom line. Don&#039;t put us on a pedestal and find us during the day, then take us out at night. ;)<br /><br />-xoxo

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Ok, I&#039;m not a Cassanova or Don Jon or whatever, but I&#039;ve had my share, at one point I was drowning in pussy so I had to wear a raincoat all of the time.&nbsp; Your first mistake is going to the bar.&nbsp; You need to be somewhere that you can be seen, preferably with a woman, find a girl who will friendzone you, then go out and do stuff, this will boost your confidence, plus she might let you watch her get naked and stuff, which is fun.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So you go to the grocerystore(produce section) on a weeknight and ask a woman if she knows where they keep the spotted dick.&nbsp; No seriously though, ask her where the Ralston&#039;s is, that pepper onion relish crap you eat over there, I love it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then chat her up.&nbsp; If she trust you enough to include you in her plans something with you, you can&#039;t be that far off.&nbsp; Next, try going to a park, find women in pairs, chat them up, find out which one likes you more, then flirt with her friend.&nbsp; She will get jealous, and they will have a who-can-fuck-the-englishman contest, Yank chicks love that game, remember, you&#039;re exotic, but in a bring home to mom n dad kind of way.&nbsp; They probably won&#039;t feel guilty having a one night stand with you.&nbsp; You can always pull the being deported card, you could even get married out of it, my friends sister married a brit so he could stay here, although they really are a couple.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Play the culture card, it will pay off, I&#039;ve heard women in the US tell me they fucked a guy just for the accent, just don&#039;t try too hard, if they won&#039;t give you attention, fuck &#039;em.&nbsp; Ask lots of questions, but in a caring and act like you really care.&nbsp; If that doesn&#039;t work, try online dating.

Keep your sensibilities, accentuate your character strengths. But also be aware of your flaws and the things about you that make you unattractive to average people (maybe you have a tendency to mumble when you speak or can be an asshole after too many drinks). <br /><br />And if you want to meet someone who is a good fit, go the places you like to go. I club a lot, so meeting girls/guys in a club or bar is not a bad idea for me, because I know they&#039;re down to party too. My first date with my husband, I had him come with me to buy coke first and then we went to a party. It set the stage for sure.<br /><br />And do not knock the online thing. I moved to a foreign country and managed to make tons of friends online. And not weirdo social retards, either. Cool people who just happen to be internet savvy. I&#039;d highly recommend OKcupid. And if you need help summing yourself up in a profile, ask a good friend who knows you well. Also ask a female friend to help you with photos because, good god, adult men almost never know their flattering angles (why on earth would you take a photo from below? So you chin is the biggest thing in the picture? Why are you swinging a sword and wearing a cape? Why is this taken with a 2003 camera phone? Please, for the love of god, put your shirt back on! Do you think the lighting could be any darker? Yes your stupid close up of your eye is both cliche and aesthetically bland) ...whew, sorry about that rant.<br /><br />Anyway, treat women like normal people and speak to us like you would a guy who&#039;ve just met and think you could be good friends with. The foundation of any good relationship is going to be friendship. Compliments are obviously nice, but if you want to stand out from the dozens of creeps we encounter each day learn to take a hint. Meaning if a woman is sitting across from you on the metro and listening and avoiding your eyes and has her arms crossed, she doesn&#039;t want to be bothered. Also don&#039;t take it personally when you get shot down, even rudely. You never know when your perfectly polite greeting is following a drunk guy who yelled &#039;AY GURL CAN I LICK YO PUSSY&#039; for seven minutes straight. And even if you&#039;re a totally nice guy, the not so nice ones tend to put us on guard and we&#039;re not always willing to take the risk required to find out if you&#039;re a normal person or total psycho.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about getting shot down. It happens and it&#039;s much better to have someone reject you flat out than to wait until you&#039;ve gone on a few dates and then admit they were never interested.<br /><br />Also the shoulder massage sounds like terrible fucking advice, tbh. Maybe don&#039;t try it without wearing protection for your twig and berries. <br /><br />God speed, broseph<br />

If everyone on MDMA, that&#039;s totally different. But the thing is: if you&#039;re a stranger, you can&#039;t know whether or not someone minds being touched by strangers (assuming they&#039;re sober). And to just go for it, imo, is a really dick move and an invasion of personal space. So it&#039;s not the touching I object to necessarily, it&#039;s who initiates it and how. A lot of girls are extremely uncomfortable being touched by strangers but will play along so as not to make things worse.

				Lol at all these people talking about picking up women when they are fucked up. You need to learn to pull pussy when you are sober, and when your female target is sober. As soon as you learn to take the pussy off the pedistal you will be a lot better off. Do yourself a favor and read &quot;The Game&quot; by Neil Strauss and watch all of RSD Julien&#039;s videos on youtube. Pulling women is a skill and once you learn how to do it, it becomes easier and easier with practice. The Game made me aware of everything, but Julien from Real Social Dynamics brought my game to the next level. If you can&#039;t go up to a random girl walking on the street and at the very least get her phone number within 5 minutes then you do not have game. <br /><br />There will be a lot of haters of the material I just advised you, but watch a few of his videos and actually apply it to your every day life when you talk to women and you will 100% notice immediate results. They have it worked down to a science. It is almost pathetic because it just goes to show that most women are all programmed exactly the same and you can exploit this. <br /><br />PM me if you want a deeper explanation.

				Am I the only one who thought, &quot;Ew&quot; after reading the title? Because, let&#039;s be serious, the title is does involve the word &quot;girls&quot;. <br /><br />Jokes aside, my advice as a random internet user that you&#039;ll never meet is don&#039;t &quot;look&quot; for a girl. Keep an open mind but my best relationship that I&#039;m currently in started when she had a different guy as her boyfriend and I thought her and I were just friends.

Instead of just telling someone to &quot;be confident, have a sense of humor, etc&quot;, it breaks it all down for you in more understandable terms.

Referring to women as &#039;targets&#039; and your social interactions as &#039;displays of your agenda&#039; just make you sound extremely clueless and like a possible date rapist. If I saw someone reading a book about &#039;gaming&#039; women and this person appeared to be over the age of 15, I&#039;d assume he has masculinity issues and/or very low emotional intelligence. In other words it&#039;s a huge *DO NOT WANT* sign. ymmv, of course.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I understand &quot;the game&quot;, but I do not like it.&nbsp; For perspective purposes, it is often important to take a step back and realize what the other sex MIGHT want, and show them the best you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think most men learn how to flirt or how to meet a woman&#039;s emotional needs for that matter, I know I had to hang out with a group of women for about 4 years to figure that out(I didn&#039;t have many guy friends for reasons i won&#039;t get into) but it taught me many things.&nbsp; You want to find someone who is into you, you don&#039;t want to make anyone do anything they wouldn&#039;t normally do, and it should be genuine.&nbsp; There are just too many social constructs in the way, so us guys need to have the walls broken down and ELI5&#039;d to us in order to understand what people want, and how to have a good relationship.&nbsp; Ultimately, the goal is to find someone who fulfills your needs, as well as you fulfilling theirs.&nbsp; I would shy away from anything on just picking up women, I don&#039;t think that is bad for a start, but you&#039;ve got to have more than that, to get yourself into a real relationship.
