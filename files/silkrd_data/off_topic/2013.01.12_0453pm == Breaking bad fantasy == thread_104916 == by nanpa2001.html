				I think about it all the time man! I would only be able to do that if I give up SR and become a model citizen though, otherwise I would just get caught within no time. Also, id need some of what Heisenburg has in his storagebox to start up :P

				I&#039;m obsessed with that shit.. If Walt and Jesse ever started back up and needed a new assistant then I&#039;d be all over it! Can&#039;t wait for the new episodes, think they&#039;re starting 14th July.

				We should seriously start pointing out SPOILER ALERTS, as something this serialized can really be half ruined if you read the wrong sentence, you know.&nbsp; So I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about seeing him at his year-away birthday buying guns.&nbsp; I missed that apparently?&nbsp; But I&#039;ve seen every episode up to the latest where Hank suddenly (SPOILER) sees the initials, and you just know from his face he realizes &quot;oh God, Walter White.&quot;&nbsp; End show.<br /><br />Have there been more after that, or am I just not remembering this birthday and guns...?

				Just checked, it is the first scene of the first episode of this series and its his 52nd birthday as he aranges the bacon on his plate into the number 52.<br /><br />Within the next few episodes its his birthday again but this time&nbsp; its his 51st birthday and we also find out that having his age written in bacon is a family tradition of his.

				Breaking bad is the best ever TV show since The wire.<br /><br />Seriously overrated tv show is severely overrated. It&#039;s good but not the greatest.<br /><br />The BB hype reminds me of when Pulp Fiction came out. For 3-4 years it was the greatest film of all time. Then the hype died and now it&#039;s just a top 100 flick.

				I cant tell you how much I love this show.&nbsp; You dont even understand what it did for the perception of chemists.&nbsp; All people used to think about drug chemists was DARE meth lab scenes and toothless motherfuckers in the woods.&nbsp; Breaking Bad does a good job of portraying the beautifully wild intellectual challenge that is advanced drug chemistry.
