				And if so what is the active ingredient, and is there an other way of doing this ingredient, because i will not do anything with my poop, or anyone&#039;s poop for that matter, no matter how high i get, the guilt for the rest of my life would not be worth it<br /><br />PS In case i wasn&#039;t clear, i do not ever intend to use poop to get high

				Yeah man, it totally works, but you can only do it with poop gas.&nbsp; That&#039;s what jenkem IS!<br /><br /><br /><br />But no, jenkem is not real, and I&#039;m not sure how you even found out about it without realizing it was always just a joke/prank.&nbsp; Don&#039;t go breathe in a bunch of fecal coliforms.

				i think it would be worth trying jenkem, as if you had reached the point where you were willing to suck on the gas of rotting shit in order to get out of your head, then even if it didnt work it wouldnt matter, as i mean how much more fucked could your life get?

				I remember a kid in high school saying this was legit. I called him out on it so that others wouldn&#039;t be fall for it, but he kept saying it in a reaffirming way (he&#039;s going to school to be a lawyer now lol). I found out later one of the kids in my class overheard it and actually BOUGHT his old shit and piss sealed in a zip lock bag to get high. The asshole told the kid he had done a lot of drugs that week so it would be extra potent. The kid came to school the next week raging. They got into a fight and the gullible kid ended up beating his ass, but that didn&#039;t stop him from getting the name &quot;reese&#039;s feces&quot; (his name was reese). I felt bad for the kid and hooked up him with a half quarter of some dank bud for free on the DL. He ended up transferring schools a week later.

				yeah i figured it was fake, because this shit(pun intended) sound to awesome for there to not be a synthetic non poopy version. I mean the kid from Africa described it as the euphoria of coke with vivid hallucination from his past, he said he could see his mom and talk to her, when she pasted a way awhile ago. Sounds cool, but all and all i&#039;d say it was a good prank for an African kid, I mean i remember seeing hilarious stuff on the news and such, but i dont know anyone that desperate for a high to huff poop air. Guess im hanging out with the right type of people

				Actually from experience yes it does. The high is not pleasant and will make you sick though. It&#039;s comparable to huffing paint. You get pretty disoriented but when it&#039;s all said and done you&#039;ll deeply regret using it.
