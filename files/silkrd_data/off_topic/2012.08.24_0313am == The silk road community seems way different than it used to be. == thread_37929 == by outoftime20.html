				them times are long gone bud. silk road is main stream now and this is what you get with something that is popular. this place is just going to keep getting worse so i suggest you stop trying to look at this place like a community full of knowledge because it&#039;s not like that anymore.

				There were plenty of scammers here 10 months ago too.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are still fairly easy to spot.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#039;t FE and if it looks too good to be true it probably is.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is still knowledge here but it&#039;s definitely been diluted a bit.

Bear.<br /><br />It is not possible for any kind of organization to maintain the same personality as it gets larger, it&#039;s a natural part of any collective&#039;s life cycle, from a forum to a corporation, even a government. <br /><br />Eventually there comes a point where the forum will naturally split up into multiple factions, it is a bit like mitosis. This is good in the long run as it provides diversity, which creates more environmental resilience, it&#039;s the story of life really. Look at how the mammals came from dinoasurs/monosaurs and then when the former died out we got our first Big Break in the ecosystem. <br /><br />/mammal philosophy

				how any one can say, that forum become less intellectual, when Pine is still here. It takes one intellectual person to disperse into shadow hundreds of half backed youtubers .<br /><br />From business point view it is totally great to see as forum and SR grows. <br /><br />Still it is difficult for me to comprehend all those Pine&#039;s evolutions theories, but you always paint yourself. You see what you want to see. You want to find shit?&nbsp; you will find tons of it everywhere and eventually you will end up living in a shit hole.<br /><br />One middle ages Arabic poet wrote to his son, - if you ever will write a poems, write about diamonds and silks, but not about brooms and rags

				The Silk Road has changed and is different from how it once was, no doubt. Change was bound to happen and will continue to happen as SR continues to grow and diversify. Change is a part of life and we need to embrace any changes and continue to contribute in any way we can to keeping this wonderful site alive and well. The core principals of SR remain the same with most of the changes being improvements and enhancements to strengthen security and enhance and simplify the user interface. That combined with new vendors starting up, new buyers joining daily and an increased presence of people on the forum will continue to make SR a site loved and cherished by many world wide. With the combined efforts of all members, I believe SR is here to stay. :)

				Thank you pine and wadozo. Obviously there are still some intelligent people here. I guess everything seemed much more legit and serious back then, I expected some sellers to stay like momiji yknow? He was awesome. But vendors either dissapear or scam or get busted or whatever... Your right I need to think more positive. More people are resisting government and the movement is growing.

				meh.<br /><br />when i showed up here a year ago I noticed that there were a large number of idiots on the forum, but also a core group of intellectuals who were always willing to post helpful comments around the board.&nbsp; <br /><br />i don&#039;t really see much difference now, other than there being more of each group.<br /><br />its no dmt-nexus, thats for sure, but all things considered i think this is the best drugs forum on the net, deep or shallow

				I&#039;ve been on road for 6 months now and I gotta say it&#039;s been the best 6 months of drug taking I&#039;ve ever had!!! Amazing products from all corners of the globe, right to my post box. Yeah there are scammers but always was, but you just have to use your brain and follow the advice given here, use the security features given and research the vendor to prevent yourself from being scammed. I&#039;ve never been scammed yet in any way and if there were any issues with a package I have been more than fairly compensated.<br /><br />I&#039;m part of a cliquey thread started by Hoffa on the forum with some other guys, and we have tried to separate our ramblings from other people&#039;s threads to keep it from stagnating and being infected by idiots, and we all know each of us are not stupid and know our shit, there are many different characters in the group and all are pretty savvy with this game so we always share advice and tips or reviews with each other so we can get reliable info and share our experiences.....As Pine said, it will evolve and people will split into sub sections, as we have, but there is still a lot of great content, just a lot more shit content too but this will happen naturally through growth, and I can see SR growing and growing from here on.......There are still communites here, just more splintered through more numbers. :)

It feels like each drug category has it&#039;s own little community, each with their own distinct personalities. In some way I feel I&#039;m &#039;at home&#039; with other like minded people, in my personal drug of choice category. The way everyone&#039;s reviewing their latest order, helping others choose the right vendors and getting excited about new batches, re-enforces this feeling of community.

				I think after the big 4:20 sale/scam the community seemed pretty jaded.<br />I used Tony76 for his L quite a bit, and I had no coins for the 4:20 sale... good thing &#039;cause I avoided that BS. I couldn&#039;t believe it.&nbsp; I still think he could have been busted, as the cops would have confiscated his bitcoins as evidence, I just don&#039;t think we could ever know for sure.&nbsp; I think overall it was good for the community though, because we spot most scams pretty early now.<br /><br />Yeah, you made us laugh MB. I think you made some bad mistakes, but I truly think you should separate your road account from the forum one, and don&#039;t ever reveal anything illegal you&#039;ve done with this forum account.&nbsp; As others stated, you were compromised, so watch out!<br /><br />I don&#039;t post as much these days, but I think it&#039;s been the busiest summer of my life, both at work and home.<br />I&#039;ll have more time for this community in the fall.
