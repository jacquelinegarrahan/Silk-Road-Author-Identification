				Take a moment to calm yourself and clear your mind. Try to just focus on your breathing.<br /><br />Just remember that this too will pass. <br /><br />Hope this helps ;D

				Try to remember that nothing that happens in this universe actually has any specific emotional baggage tied to it, and that whatever has happened is not happening for any particular reason. It&#039;s a shitty day because random factors just so happened to align in an inconvenient way. Tomorrow, those factors might go the opposite way. Its all ultimately random in the scheme of things. Enjoy the chaos. =)
