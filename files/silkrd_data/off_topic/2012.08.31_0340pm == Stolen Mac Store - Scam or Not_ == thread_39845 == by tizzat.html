				I&#039;ve been looking at there store now for almost 2 years since i first came to the darknet. never found out if it was a scam. I used to believe silkroad was a scam but then i realized that all the users couldnt be fake after stalking it for a few weeks.

Thats how things where before silkroad came and saved everyone.<br /><br />Not to mention, Years ago from the person who introduced me to the darknet I hard stories about how they retrieved the items, aka running mass credit card fraud in the apple stores and traveling across the nation in packs. but they now say they get there items from china??? idk

				Try and get them to let you use escrow - <br /><br />https://btcrow.com/escrow_fee_calculator.php<br /><br /><br />IF they really wont - my trust would begin to wane right there, but you are right they have been around for a long time and while I have never heard scam....I have never heard that they are legit either. :\<br />
