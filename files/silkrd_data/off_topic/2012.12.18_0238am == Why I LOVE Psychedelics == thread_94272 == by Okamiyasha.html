Yes i am very suggestable and im like the most docile person youll ever know( fucking NOT). Ive been doing LSD for over a decade, and i assure you friend, IM NO IDIOT. In fact im quite a bit smarter than your average bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;Thats a very interesting view on what the tor network is about and what its purpose is, and i respect that you have your own unique opinion, but please, do not force it upon the people who beliefs are contrary to yours. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also I would like ask if i may, what exactly is your business here on the forums and SR?<br /><br />EDIT: My tony the Tiger reference was in no way directed at children ( if there happen to be any present here ), but at intelligent, responsable,&nbsp; middle aged adults that grew up on frosted flakes, the pun was that it ( the LSD) makes me us feel like kids again.&nbsp; <br />

I know it&#039;s a natural thing and all and I have red many trip reports on erowid about it and saw all the information about how they have big DMT events out west and they have had these rituals for a number of years. I too am turned off by the plastic taste and the short legs of the DMT trip. I&#039;ve only had it on top of weed in a bowl so if I try it with a glass pipe maybe it would feel better on the lungs?

				+1 to Okamiyasha for a wonderful post! <br /><br />Just two quick points, psychedelics it&#039;s just one title given to a class of drugs. The association immediately done by the uneducated mind (like myself before trying them) is that they are all about illusion and nothing is real about the experience, which is completely wrong. There is no way to prove this to someone except with experience, but I believe a more accurate definition to this class of drugs is &quot;entheogenic&quot; which comes from the greek words &quot;en&quot; and &quot;theo&quot; which literally translate to &quot;within&quot; and &quot;God&quot;. And this is precisely what psychedelics/entheogenics are all about - it put you in touch with the God within you. <br /><br />The other misconception here is that LSD is some chemilca, and DMT is more natural. Wrong - there is some chemical work done to arrive to what we call LSD, but the substance is derived purely from nature, ergot fungi to be precise. Quote from wikipedia:<br /><br />&quot;LSD is an ergoline derivative. It is commonly synthesised by reacting diethylamine with an activated form of lysergic acid. Activating reagents include phosphoryl chloride[67] and peptide coupling reagents.[68] Lysergic acid is made by alkaline hydrolysis of lysergamides like ergotamine, a substance derived from the ergot fungus on rye, or from ergine (lysergic acid amide, LSA), a compound that is found in morning glory (Ipomoea tricolor) and Hawaiian baby woodrose (Argyreia nervosa) seeds.&quot;<br /><br />Albert Hofmann in his book &quot;LSD my problem child&quot; goes in depth explaining how on a molecular level all psychedelics including DMT and LSD are related between them.

No one gives a shit. It is alright to research drugs and even share your opinion of certain drugs if they ask but at the end of the day it is their indiviual decsion to take the drug or not.

				*licking my lips* <br /><br />gotta say I do love me a few doses at night. My friends and I love tripping and getting lost in the music we put on for hours.<br /><br />I absolutely love tripping dose and playing guitar, makes me feel like I&#039;m a hendrix reincarnation for a sweet couple hours..<br />god damn I just feel bad for people who are too close minded to see what psychedelics can do for them. Top all time favorite is tripping Ayahuasca with a shaman and world travelers in South America and having them play music to bring everyone together., the words mind blowing and life changing barely shed light onto what it has done for me.
