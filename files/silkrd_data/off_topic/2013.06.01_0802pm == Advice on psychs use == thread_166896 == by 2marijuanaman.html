				I was wondering if anyones had a similar experience to this. About 6 months ago I took a 10-strip of lsd and thought I was talking to God and Jesus Christ for like, 12 hours. It scared the shit out of me. Im still very curious about psychsbut I cant go through that again. I also took 11 grams of Iboga root bark once. THAT was a spiritual experience if I&#039;ve ever had one.&nbsp; haven&#039;t touched heroin since. Salvia just really freaked me out and scared me too, but I&#039;m still curious about it. I once tried dmy but didnt &quot;break through&quot;, just had an intense rushing sensation. DMT is probably the one I&#039;m most curious about now.<br /><br />I want personal expierences on all of these, and advice that could be useful to a very young man whos just discovered such things in the past year. Silk Roads been an amazing experience for me, I just need a nice long break after that `10-strip cause it was a little overboard I think. But not Im ready to learn more, I really want advice to be shared. I dont always trust google searches, and besides, they say silk road is a family, and you come to your family for advice right? <br /><br />Im a sponge ready to absorb the wisdom of more experienced psych users. Please share all warnings and guidance with me that you have to offer. Good links to the freeweb are also much appreciated.

				You should give LSD another shot but this time at a reasonable dose ;D<br />Or maybe an alkylated 2C (2C-D, 2C-E or 2C-P)?

				lsd is definitely my favorite &quot;psychs&quot; but you have to be in the right headspace for it.<br />its an awesomely enlightening chem but if there is things that you are uncertain about <br />in you life or events going on. has the potential to go the other direction. the &quot;set and setting&quot;<br />rule has always applied and thats why i think ive never had a bad trip. never force it. happy trails!
