				I&#039;m heading to Thailand in a couple of weeks. Just had a friend come back from there and he said that he just went into a pharmacy and bought some Ritalin without a prescription. Had a very enjoyable time by all accounts. Is this for real or is he speaking shit? If you can get Ritalin, then what about Adderall?

				Stuff like valium is over the counter over there. At the right places you can get pain meds too, however thats under the counter.

				your likelihood of getting the real goodies increases the further away from the main centers you get, <br />&nbsp;<br />Ive also heard tales of pharmacy&#039;s in Cambodia selling vials of morphine sulphate over the counter !

				I wonder how potent the stuff is.&nbsp; I would think that it would be counterfeit in many places, or diluted down, but if your friend says he had a great time, maybe it is the sweet stuff
