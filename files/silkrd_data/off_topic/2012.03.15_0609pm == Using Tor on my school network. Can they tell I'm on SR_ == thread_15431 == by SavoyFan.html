				can you be a bit more specific? are you talking high school or college? ...I&#039;m assuming college, which, if that&#039;s the case, i&#039;m pretty sure they don&#039;t give a **** what you&#039;re browsing, even if they could tell.&nbsp; Colleges are pretty liberal in this regard simply because student can say it&#039;s for a project/paper they&#039;re working on.<br /><br />So yea, if you&#039;re on campus using wifi, or even library comps, i wouldn&#039;t worry about it.<br /><br />if you&#039;re talking high school, just wait until you get home! jeez!

				If you use your own computer along with a Tor bridge they shouldn&#039;t be able to tell that you&#039;re using Tor at all.

				...i wouldn&#039;t use school bandwidth, but if you&#039;re sure its unregulated (don&#039;t see why they would be so daft as to trust students) -and you really know what ya doing then<br />&nbsp; perhaps..idea is you need to be anonymous and your &quot;logon&quot; not to be traced back to you.<br />&nbsp;::)

				You have to configure Tor to use bridges yourself. I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;re using Tor Bundle.<br />Vidalia&gt;Settings&gt;Network&gt;My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network&gt;Find bridges<br /><br />Don&#039;t be doing this over wifi that requires identification BTW.

Since your question belied your lack of knowledge of how Tor works (nothing wrong with this), why are you part of something on Tor where if you get caught your life is effectively over? Do you really have that much faith that the network is completely anonymous and will protect you? Not hating, just curious...

				@ QTC - Well, I guess I am hoping they don&#039;t care enough about me to ever use enough resources to really fuck me up the ass. Also I have problems foreseeing future consequences and am quite happy to live in my delusion land where SR is just progressive, not fucked up illegal. <br /><br />However, I really have no faith in TOR&#039;s anonymous nature or security and have been under the impression my skule knows exactly what I am doing and are only waiting for me to screw up, EG get droogz shipped to my dorm mailbox. If you are saying they don&#039;t know what sights I am visiting and can only tell that I am using TOR, little else, that&#039;s news to me<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to provide my logon information to start a Wifi or Ethernet internet session so yeahhh, fuck&nbsp; :-\

				On the one hand, most Universities don&#039;t give a shit about traffic as long as you aren&#039;t slowing things down or bringing shit down on them, like RIAA copyright infringement notices.&nbsp; They CAN tell you&#039;re using TOR, if they care, but they generally cannot see what you&#039;re doing with it.<br /><br />Just using TOR alone, will not give them reason to setup an entire surveillance team to catch which sites you&#039;re visiting.&nbsp; Now, if you&#039;re under investigation from LE and THEY decide to track you back to the University network, well, then the school is obligated to cooperate to remove the evil drug fiends from campus.<br />Chances are the University does have your IP registered as a matter of connecting to the network to begin with, and if LE gets it through hacking certain TOR nodes, they can just ask the school who was using that IP at that time.<br /><br />TOR is pretty darned safe, though, I must add.&nbsp; Otherwise they would have caught Sabu, of Lulsec, much earlier.&nbsp; Both they and others associated with the case said basically, his biggest mistake was signing onto IRC without using TOR.&nbsp; Before that it was a hunting game, and after the single mistake of connecting unencrypted he was toast.<br /><br />TOR isn&#039;t impervious, but they&#039;re not going to crack that ever-changing nut without pouring big money into it.&nbsp; Some people out there use TOR to protect their very lives, and don&#039;t have anything to do with drugs.&nbsp; This tool is used by thousands of folks out there who are defying governments, law enforcement, and corporate interests.<br /><br />All it takes is one mistake people.<br />I think our SILC chat is our weakest link.<br />It&#039;s too bad we didn&#039;t have an anonymous chat room here, built into the site itself.
