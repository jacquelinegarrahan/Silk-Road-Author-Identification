				So sorry to hear that, rowdy. :( I only barely know you from a couple of thread replies but you seem like a really good person, and losing a parent is the worst thing anyone can go through, especially when you&#039;re that close..<br /><br />I&#039;m not a religious person, but you&#039;re in my thoughts dude.. Sending good vibes your way; stay strong spirited, cry as much as possible, get the anguish out and when you feel you can, start mourning your loss.. but no matter how bad things get, never forget that the future is always just around the corner. I won&#039;t say that a loss like that gets easier with time, but it does get easier to &lt;i&gt;deal with&lt;/i&gt;..<br /><br />You take it easy, brother.. :(<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				I discovered this place about three months ago and it still feels too good to be true. I first thought this thing was mostly shady and I would be lucky to get anything in the mail, or perhaps even le. I took a gamble, and I found myself in a community of kind people who are only criminals because of unjust law. Which is why I am so anti-gun on this peaceful business community. Anyway, enough with this ranting, I just love this so much. My heart is with you, buddy.

I&#039;ll see if I can sort something out for you over the next 2 / 3 weeks - it depends when I have a bit of extra cash in. At the minute I&#039;m trying to scrape together enough for a few large orders, but with some of the profit I make off that I&#039;ll see if I can sort something out with one of the vendors I&#039;ve used before to be sent to you and I&#039;ll pay for it. It won&#039;t be high grade stuff, but you&#039;ll be able to make enough on it to order more and get some cash rolling in.<br />I&#039;ll let you know here when I can sort something out! &#039;Til then, keep your chin up man, take it easy, and no matter how hard things get, better times are always just around the corner.<br /><br />- grahamgreene<br />

				Looks like I was late, Graham done covered ya. @Graham, fuck yeah, mang! \m/<br />I still owe you one,man. <br />I am sorry to hear about your dad. I also am not religious, but I lost my brother/best friend 5 years ago, and am still in deep mourning,<br />so I know how you feel. Wish I had my vendors account, I&#039;d hit you up with some stuff. Go heavy on the herb, man! It sure does help. <br />I&#039;m not sure of your disposition, but I love hallucinogenics during bad times. Always makes me smile. And to think more clearly. <br />who fucking cares your dad drank himself to death...he was doing what he loved, right?!?!?!<br />My brother was also a very heavy drinker @ the young age of 25, he went off the road, scraped, gas tank ripped open, hit a tree, knocked out, <br />car aflame. It&#039;s longer than that, but you get the point. He was also directly across the street from the cemetery. Where he is now buried. <br />Me and another younger brother are puffin some hash in your dad&#039;s honor right now. <br />I got 3btc I can&#039;t spend (nothing that cheap here!) so let me know if you need a bump up. <br />Also, if your dad was EVER in the military, unless dishonorably discharged, they will pay for the funeral, casket, and plot, although the plot will be at the VA. VA also might give you some meds to &quot;calm you down&quot; from your trauma. They&#039;re always trying to get me to do pills! lol<br />I know we don&#039;t know each other, other than these here forums, but you helped me twice, for no fucking reason, other than your heart,<br />so if you need something, let a brother know. <br />Hey, I&#039;m also glad your dad was your friend. It&#039;s better than just having a son! <br />Peace,<br />SD

				I&#039;m sure your dad was a pretty cool guy for you to be this broken up.&nbsp; I wish there were more we could do.&nbsp; Time is probably the only one who can help you now, though.&nbsp; Keep trekkin&#039; and don&#039;t forget there is always someone who cares.
