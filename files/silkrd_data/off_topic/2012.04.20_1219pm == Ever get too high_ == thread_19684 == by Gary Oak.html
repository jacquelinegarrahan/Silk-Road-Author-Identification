				To begin with, I can&#039;t sleep so I decided to eat on of my edibles I baked earlier as I figured it would help.....well wrong choice! These little fuckers are potent as shit and now my ears can&#039;t stop having orgasms! &gt;:( I&#039;m getting over bronchitis so I haven&#039;t smoked in a while so I&#039;m guessing my tolerance is somewhat tweaked, thanks to that and eating the entire edible I&#039;m too fucking high and it sucks. My brain won&#039;t stop tickling....damn it all to hell!<br /><br />Also McDonald&#039;s won&#039;t be open for breakfast for a few more hours and I could eat about 3 dozen of their Bacon, Egg, and Sausage McGriddles right now!<br />FFFFFUUUUUUUU-

				Back in my early smoking days I got so high I ate a whole box of spaghetti and about half a box of cereal and then puked it all up because I was too full, but then ate more because I still had the munchies.<br /><br />

				Heh I got too high a few weeks back and nearly had a full blown panic attack..wasn&#039;t nice. Felt like my head was gonna explode or was gonna have a seizure. It helps if you have benzos on standby for such a situation..best thing to do is break one in half and let it dissolve under yer tongue, goes into blood stream rapidly and calms yer down. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had a go at making my own edibles too with some success.. it is hard to gage the strength and work out dose tho innit? it can vary batch by batch unless you had a lot of practice and perfected a method.. I just start out real low and work it up gradually.. you have to allow at least 40-60 minutes for it to go through the digestive system and also best to do it on an empty stomach.

				I went OTT on meth a few weeks back, full blown hallucinations and paranoia, fortunately I had some benzos on hand... Not enough to sleep, but enough to calm me down!!<br />Lesson learned however! Small bumps with meth... not smoking 200mg in one go!
