				If I vote then it will be for Obama but i probly wont even vote. What a bunch of bullshit this election is. Ron Paul is My guy and the media worked hard to keep him quiet and mitt romney is just a guy standing in to be beat. They wouldn&#039;t let ron paul in because he actually had a chance to beat Obama but I wont be surprised if Rand Paul runs and wins in 2016. Check out this picture.<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=b5c7cad628b31f83c0a3914a8884f0ca.jpg<br /><br />any opinions?

				This is going to sound really ignorant but, what happened to Obama&#039;s popularity?<br /><br />All I know is, everyone was really happy when he originally got voted in. All around the world people seemed to believe he was ushering in a new time and a great change from the previous administration, especially for his foreign policies. But since then, Americans seem to have become disheartened with him. I haven&#039;t been following your domestic affairs as closely these last few years. I mean there&#039;s a lot going on here in the UK and the EU as well, not to mention the other global events. It&#039;s been a busy year for us in the UK, we&#039;ve had the Euro2012 football to watch, and then at home we&#039;ve had the Queens jubilee and the Olympics in London.<br /><br />But anyway, what happened to Obama&#039;s popularity?

But in reality, there is a difference. Sure, one&#039;s just left of center and the other is just right (well, a bit more than just, but still...), but here&#039;s just a few of the differences (and I&#039;m no expert, so please feel free to correct me if I&#039;m wrong):<br /><br />One supports the federal law allowing a woman to choose to get an abortion. The other is a fucktwat, and members of his party include Congressmen who believe a woman can&#039;t get pregnant during a &quot;forceable&quot; rape. He has also mentioned making it a priority to overturn Roe v. Wade. <br /><br />One supports science&#039;s efforts to help the human race by engaging in stem cell research. The other gets his &quot;values&quot; from his big, holy book that tells him this is a sin, and therefore he opposes it. <br /><br />One is making efforts (albeit them rather dialed in) to curb American &quot;war&quot; efforts. The other has likely profited on the souls of dead soldiers, and finds no issue with the $3 TRILLION plus the US has spent since 2001.<br /><br />One believes in the death penalty, despite the fact the US is the only Westernized nation in the world that uses it, and also happens to have a pretty damn high rate of inmates (I think it&#039;s top 3, maybe the top. But there is just too much fucking money to be made to NOT have so many people locked up). The other doesn&#039;t support the dealth penalty.<br /><br />One is a backwoods bible thumper who truly still believes, in 2012, that a man and man can&#039;t get married because his BOOK tells him it&#039;s bad. His Mormon book. I&#039;m not hating on anyone&#039;s beliefs, but look up the story of Mormonism. Aliens, dude. Seriously. Fucking aliens. But two dudes can&#039;t get married. Retarded. The other, incidentally, openly supports equal rights. <br /><br />And here&#039;s the big one:<br /><br />One opposes the legalization of marijuana, even for medicinal reasons. But he believes in fucking aliens. The other has admitted he smoked weed. He fucking grew up in Hawaii. Of course he did.<br /><br />Now, all the other shit aside, and all the talk of it doesn&#039;t matter - maybe that&#039;s true. But look at it as the lesser of two evils. Fuck. Even if they&#039;re exactly the same, one&#039;s gonna say it&#039;s all good to get high, and the other is gonna throw you in PRISON for SMOKING A JOINT so his alien-believing buddies all get rich. That&#039;s it. Yeah fuck Ron Paul is the man and it would have been a revolution. But it&#039;s not happening yet. And fuck I&#039;m glad I don&#039;t live in that country. But shit - at least vote for the guy who you hate less; who is gonna fuck up YOUR shit less. No?<br /><br />Also, one is named Wilard Mitt. The other is named Barack. Even just based on that - who you gonna pick?<br /><br />tl;dr - I&#039;m baked and think that, yeah they both probably suck, but at least vote for the dude with a cool name that thinks weed isn&#039;t the devil.

				In all reality, it seems to me that the presidential election is just a distraction from the election of congress. It doesn&#039;t really matter who the president is if the congress isn&#039;t&nbsp; putting bills on his desk to sign. Yeah, everyone blames the president for this or that, but the real elections that matter are the house and senate, because the president (for the most part) isn&#039;t just enacting their will on the people. BUT when the focus is put on the tax returns of this candidate or the social views of the other candidate, then the status quo gets the seats that matter in congress. For my vote, I could give a fuck who is at the top of the ballot, I don&#039;t want people in congress who want nothing more than to sit in their cushy jobs and not do anything. I was watching coverage of the republican convention today and a reporter asked a question to the house member in the group to the effect of &quot;why haven&#039;t you guys been doing anything&quot; to which she replied a long list of what they were doing. Everything she listed began with &quot;we tried to repeal....&quot; AND she mentioned obamacare as 4 of the things they tried to repeal. So what she is saying (to me) is we collectively passed a bill, then spent the next three years trying to undo what we had just passed. What the fuck! Do I agree with Obamacare....I don&#039;t really understand all of the ins and out, but overall, my opinion is this. a majority of people voted YES, then when you tried to repeal it, a majority voted NO. End of fucking story, now move on and actually do something that your being paid to do. Stop whining about the other people don&#039;t want to....STFU and deal with it. That is how democracy works.<br /><br />Did these politicians sleep through the class about how democracy works in their orientations? <br /><br />Anyway, on to the presidential election. <br /><br />Obama, if you claim to support patients right to use MMJ, stop fucking closing dispensaries!<br />Romney, If you want people to stop talking about your tax returns, STOP claiming that they are all in order and release them.<br />Obama, social programs spending the money that I give in taxes like welfare should have a work requirement. I work for my money, and welfare recipients should have to try to work also.<br />Romney, getting rid of the capital gains tax is OK with me as long as you get rid of the tax on the money I actually work to earn. (to be fair, I support a flat tax)<br /><br />WRITE IN WRETCHED 2012

And, over this recession I&#039;ve realized that it&#039;s economic forces that are the real driving force behind our countries. <br /><br />I still believe politics plays a part on the smaller local scale. I&#039;ll still vote in my local elections because I feel it has more of an impact, and the different ideologies of the local candidates are more distinct at this level of government.

				Yea it really is bullshit here in the American election. Congress runs everything and the president is just a fall guy. I liked ron pauls idea of cutting the government in half and to stop trying to police the world. Even the president of isreal said they didn&#039;t want anymore help from America. And I like his policy on legalizing drugs and his foreign aid policy. It seemed to me that he made more since then any of the others especially newt gingrich. What a fucking joke. Like the people wouldn&#039;t remember how he did with the reagen administration. I have always voted demacratic. I believe in people&#039;s right to freedom to do what they want on thier own property in their own homes and to their own bodies. If a woman gets pregnant and wants an abortion then it&#039;s up to her and she&#039;s the one that has to live with it. It would be easy to live with it if it&#039;s a forced rape I suppose. But if the Republican Party really wanted to have a republican president then Dr. Paul would have had a better chance to win but they have done everything in their power to drag his name thru the mud and keep him out of the media. But honestly Obama could not have straightened up the mess he inherited in 4 years anyway. Nobody could. It&#039;s congress who has the task of doing that anyway. Like I said the president is just a fron man and no matter who votes for who, congress is going to have in there who they want. Did you see where all those primaries were falseified and recounted? It&#039;s no different then when Al Gore Won Florida but George&#039;s brother fucked him out of that.

				Why would I vote, considering that:<br /><br />- One person&#039;s vote has no impact on the outcome of the election, since the difference in the number of votes between presidential candidates is always over a million. If the candidate I prefer is going to win, he (or she) will win regardless of my vote.&nbsp; &nbsp;My vote makes no difference. Voting is an irrational behaviour.<br /><br />- All of the candidates are garbage.&nbsp; We live in a one-party state with two somewhat different factions. All have nonsensical positions on the issues that matter.<br /><br />- Democracy itself is a failed system.

				We have more options then Obama and Romney. Vote for who makes the best president not who is most likely going to be president.<br /><br />I&#039;m voting for Gary Johnson he is a fantastic human being with amazing ideas very similar to Ron Paul.

				The only candidates that I am aware of that I like are Paul and Johnson.&nbsp; I am not aligned with any form of government in the end because I do not find myself to be knowledgeable enough in that field though I have thought about it a lot.&nbsp; I really wish that they were atheists though, that is the only thing that I really disagree with Paul about, there is even a video on youtube of Paul saying that he doesn&#039;t believe in evolution.&nbsp; I think at some point he released a statement that says he does believe in evolution but all the same.<br /><br />The difference between ObamaRomney and Paul/Johnson is huge though, literally everything Paul says about most things such as foreign policy make perfect sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />To be honest I&#039;m fucking disgusted with anyone voting Obama, go fuck yourself, he is clearly a worthless corporationist pawn.&nbsp; Seriously I&#039;m pissed off right now thinking about PEOPLE ON A FUCKING DRUG FORUM WHO VOTE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS ADMITTED TO DOING COCAINE AND WEED AND STILL WON&#039;T COME OUT FOR LEGALIZATION, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?&nbsp; FUCKING ASSHOLES.&nbsp; Personally I wish that the stupid cunt had gotten busted, he sure as fuck wouldn&#039;t be president then.&nbsp; Anyway, I got that out of my system hopefully back to pretending to be an intellectual.&nbsp; He has clearly continued Bushes policy of unnecessary wars and taking the rights away from US citizens wherever possible, I don&#039;t doubt for a second that illegal surveillance is at an all time high and will only get worse.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh and for the corporationist side:&nbsp; ever heard of the bail out?&nbsp; If you don&#039;t see something wrong with the bail out then I&#039;m not even going to fucking explain it to you.&nbsp; His health care bill is total bullshit as well, it&#039;s essentially corporation based socialism where if you don&#039;t pay the insurance companies to get you health care then the government will come fuck you up, not real socialism of course, more like the dictator pretending to run the country with a philosophy like in the early 1900s.&nbsp; In the end insurance companies are an almost completely pointless filter between medicine and man.&nbsp; Think about it, if the insurance companies became a branch of the government then absolutely nothing would change except that we would pay less and there wouldn&#039;t be people at the top getting richer every time someone died instead of getting treatment.&nbsp; If the government is going to be enforcing insurance anyway why not just make it a branch of the government since it would be better for everyone except the people making money?&nbsp; I&#039;ll tell you why, because obama is a fucking pawn for the insurance companies.<br /><br />Also I really disagree with the conspiracy theorists out there when they go into their illuminati-esque view of the government etc, I mean just look at things like the catholic church or mormonism, there is no limit to what a bunch of ignorant egotistical dumbasses can accomplish if enough people are stupid enough to follow like sheep.&nbsp; I find it funny that a lot of people believe that there are some super intelligent beings out there who somehow run everything as if that was in some way plausible or possible, but who knows I guess.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; It might seem contradictory for me to be equally attracted to socialism and communism as I am to libertarianism and anarchy.&nbsp; Even on these forums I see people associating those ideas with the pseudo-socialist and pseudo-communist governments that have denigrated the ideas in the past.&nbsp; In truth socialism and communism have never really been tried, and there would be no loss of individual freedom in democratic socialism.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that no matter what government is in power total transparency is quite possibly the most necessary missing ingredient.&nbsp; Every public official should have to have all records regarding money and property and maybe even communication open to the public in my opinion.&nbsp; There should be no &quot;classified&quot; information either.&nbsp; I mean who gave the government, which is supposed to be run by the people for the people the right to classify information away from the people?&nbsp; I mean holy shit.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;m done typing finally.

				People think government is all horrible. I disagree.<br /><br />As much as it seems like our current (U.S.) government sucks, the truth is that most of the governments that came before it sucked worse.<br /><br />Politics, by definition, is the non-violent resolution of conflict.<br /><br />Government is basically mediating differences between two different parties who feel strongly enough about the issues to get VIOLENT about them, but preventing violence from happening. Fair resolution to those kinds of conflicts are going to inevitably result in both sides being unhappy about the solution.<br /><br />Now laws against cannabis and such basically came out of left field and dickslapped us, and this doesn&#039;t make sense to me. That&#039;s the only thing that truly upsets me.<br /><br />Otherwise, the only alternative is anarchy. Anyone who wants to criticize the system as a whole can&#039;t really do so without being able to propose a more effective system. And that&#039;s a lot harder than it sounds.<br /><br />As for me, I&#039;m a liberal. I say let&#039;s not let the poor live like complete shit if we don&#039;t have to, and lets not have oppressive social policies. I think Obama&#039;s done a pretty fine job compared to what Bush did, and I&#039;m going to throw up in my mouth a little if Romney gets elected.

				I have been watching the convention on and off yesterday and today, and while the speeches are the same &quot;what you want to hear&quot;&nbsp; BS that they will be at the DNC, I find that something is missing today that was very present yesterday. It really took me a while to figure it out, but I finally did. You know whats missing? the &quot;we made that&quot; signs. I don&#039;t know if the people just got tired of holding them or if they realized that the signs made it look like a socialism convention to people just flipping channels.
