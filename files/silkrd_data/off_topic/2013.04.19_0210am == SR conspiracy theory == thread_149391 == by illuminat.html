				the OP&#039;s question doesnt even make sense to me, how is that a conspiracy theory?<br />Maybe DPR made SR to buy drugs, maybe to sell drugs. Probably neither tho. Who the fuck cares.<br />maybe DPR is a group of people, i cant imagine one person doing all this work and maintenance all the time but who&nbsp; knows?

				I think DPR is a woman and lives on the west-coast.<br />The state Washington or in that neighborhood.<br />Between San Diego and Vancouver, somewhere.<br /><br />And yes she does sell, alt least she did have a seller license ... lol !<br /><br />A tricky thing to stay independent as a seller and judge (administrator)<br /><br />I think she gave the selling part up and earns just the fees.<br /><br />A independent anarchistic woman with a universality study from Stanford or Berkeley.<br /><br />Around 40 years of age. (Late 30&#039;s, early 40&#039;s)<br /><br />But I am no profiler, and haven&#039;t read more then e few phrases from DPR.<br />What can you make of 50 words?<br /><br />She shares her thought&#039;s and opinions, what can narrow her down to a smaller spot to look for.<br /><br />A activist in her own way.<br /><br />Let&#039;s not point her out, or even try to.<br />We are being watched.<br />Probably is SR one of the most investigated sites by L.E.<br /><br />Sr can&#039;t be closed, so L.E. has to take her out personally.<br /><br />I hope she lives in a civil state.<br />Living in Texas and giving the opportunity to sell drugs on this magnitude will mean , <br />she is going to the gas-chamber.<br /><br />California is not liberal either.<br />Utah, Nevada? Salt Lake City or Vegas?<br />Noop, I see her in the State of Washington.<br /><br />In Microsoft country, saying &quot;&quot;cheers&quot;&quot; to Satishi Nakamoto and taking a zip of her beer, straight from the bottle...<br /><br />This site has a major priority when it comes to shutting down.<br /><br />My guess is that she did sell but doesn&#039;t anymore.<br /><br />The fees on this site are enough.<br /><br />Selling is a waste of time to her.<br /><br />Selling big time would draw attention.<br /><br /><br />But she may sell, why not?<br /><br />I think she has better things to do, like spending her money and enjoying live.<br /><br />To sell is to much work now.<br /><br />SR is the biggest criminal organisation on the internet.<br />Sr gives the opportunity to sell drugs.<br />She will be held accountable for every gram that is sold.<br /><br />And I bet you L.E. keeps a record of every single gram that&#039;s sold here.<br />L.E. is building a very big file, so when it comes to court most work will be already done.<br /><br />I hope they will let her live.<br /><br />Damn governments !
