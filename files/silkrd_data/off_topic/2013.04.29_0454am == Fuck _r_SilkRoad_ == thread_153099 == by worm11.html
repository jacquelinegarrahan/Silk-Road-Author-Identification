				It&#039;s really nothing more than a bunch of kiddies asking how to get bitcoins and how they should go about ordering drugs to their mommy and daddy&#039;s house. Every time I browse through there (which admittedly isn&#039;t very often) it&#039;s the same thing. It has always been bad but lately it has gotten an influx of obvious 15-18 year olds that has made it a lot worse.

				I&#039;ve seen numerous people use their longtime (year+) personal reddit account on there talking about getting various controlled substances shipped to them in the US.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what makes these people think that having this nonchalant attitude towards these serious offenses that they are committing and openly admitting to on the clearnet is okay.<br /><br />The low hanging fruit keeps them busy and away from the rest of us though.

I also wondered about this today, and while I didn&#039;t say anything, I would agree that it is in their best interest to change their name.... you cannot be on reddit and Silk Road as well and have the same name, it is just bad security. If the person I am referring to reads this post (and they will), then change your name on reddit. Also, don&#039;t be on /r/SilkRoad/ to begin with, it is clearnet for godsakes. <br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				fuck reddit, period. <br /><br />Bunch of fucking knowitall &#039;children&#039; jokesters. I dont care what education they have. Together, they are as wise as ham sandwich. Had potential...if we weren&#039;t human! I read more progressive wisdom on 4chan.<br /><br />Think of it this way. In science...what do you want to avoid? Strict peer approved research, basically! Because in the end, People limit or constrain themselves through wanting approval from the &#039;pack&#039;, which in my experience creates dull, uninspiring and even corrupt research results. <br /><br />SR forums is what its all about. Fucking company of gentlemanly heros here :)&nbsp; *tips hats to fellow SR trash*

				I should&#039;ve known there would be a silkroad subreddit. I&#039;ll avoid it like the plaque and at the same time try my best to make note of all the vendors who post there (However if they are just posting under a name and don&#039;t post their public key you can&#039;t know for sure they are not a sock puppet, if they do post a matching public key then they are the dumbest fucking vendors on the planet) Either way it is good to make note of the vendor name and keep it in mind when ordering.

				/r/silkroad is the bottom of the barrel of SR users. I suspect a large percentage of them have never used the browser bundle. They access SR through clearnet proxies like onion.to and onion.sh, which of course means they post on /r/silkroad with their real IP addresses. The more sophisticated people might use a VPN, which offers little protection if LE really wants to find them. There appears to be very little overlap between the /r/silkroad and forum communities.

				Don&#039;t care at all about shutting a subreddit down. People (unfortunately vendors who should know better) are going to be careless there is nothing we can do to stop that. I do however care enough about potential vendors I might use posting there and using the .to tor2web proxy. I could just be being paranoid but I would rather not order from a vendor so careless with their security. At one point they might have one of my addresses and if they are that careless I don&#039;t want them having any info that can lead back to me. Keeping a tab on any vendor in the subreddit and then never ordering from them i think is a good way to mitigate this security risk.<br /><br />Properly using Tor is what I meant. if they are connecting through Tor to reddit then that&#039;s fine. I know it is secure when properly used but I also do not vend, so using tbb is fine for me right now. If I ever did start to vend (unlikely) I would run Tails through a partitioned part of my hard-drive through a VM spoofing my MAC address before using Tor. I would do this from a labtop hitting a different wifi spot each time. That might sound like overkill but I would rather be a little paranoid and safe then risk myself or customers.<br /><br />What I understand now (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) is that even though my ISP cannot decrypt my traffic they can still tell that I am using Tor(unmasking me is possible through timing attacks if I am correct). There is also a vulnerability with your traffic being peeked from the exit node to it&#039;s destination if the person running the exit node chooses to do so. In the beginning of my time on SR I made newbie mistakes by not having certain plug-ins disabled (tor button comes to mind) but also JavaScript, flash, ActiveX etc (I quickly corrected this). Then there is the fact that when you begin using Tor you must obtain the relay list from a directory server, I am guessing this is how your ISP would know you are using Tor.<br /><br />I am mostly concerned about the exit node vulnerability and the possibility of governments running so many relays out there that they can decrypt traffic (besides just the exit node relay) although I bet you would have to be connected at every point to a compromised relay in order for this to work and it would be easier to do it through the exit relays. Finally Tor is supposed to randomly choose which relays to connect to but in my months of using Tor I&#039;ve noticed this isn&#039;t always the case, it seems to connect me to the same relays making me a little suspicious. It doesn&#039;t always connect me to the same relays but often it connects me to the same entrance relay (could really use some explanation for this, what am I missing?).<br /><br />If I am incorrect or being paranoid about any of this please come in and correct me. I usually do my own research as I see a ton of new people on SR asking so many questions I don&#039;t have time to answer the ones I feel proficient enough to answer, but since we are on the topic I thought you guys could help me out. <br />

People (unfortunately vendors who should know better) are going to be careless there is nothing we can do to stop that. I do however care enough about potential vendors I might use posting there and using the .to tor2web proxy. I could just be being paranoid but I would rather not order from a vendor so careless with their security. At one point they might have one of my addresses and if they are that careless I don&#039;t want them having any info that can lead back to me. Keeping a tab on any vendor in the subreddit and then never ordering from them i think is a good way to mitigate this security risk.<br /><br />Properly using Tor is what I meant. if they are connecting through Tor to reddit then that&#039;s fine. I know it is secure when properly used but I also do not vend, so using tbb is fine for me right now. If I ever did start to vend (unlikely) I would run Tails through a partitioned part of my hard-drive through a VM spoofing my MAC address before using Tor. I would do this from a labtop hitting a different wifi spot each time. That might sound like overkill but I would rather be a little paranoid and safe then risk myself or customers.<br /><br />What I understand now (please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) is that even though my ISP cannot decrypt my traffic they can still tell that I am using Tor(unmasking me is possible through timing attacks if I am correct). There is also a vulnerability with your traffic being peeked from the exit node to it&#039;s destination if the person running the exit node chooses to do so. In the beginning of my time on SR I made newbie mistakes by not having certain plug-ins disabled (tor button comes to mind) but also JavaScript, flash, ActiveX etc (I quickly corrected this).

I had ordered multiple packages from SR before, all of whom had arrived with no issues. I live in Scandinavia and ordered international as always. Usually a package would take about one week to arrive from this particular vendor so when it approached two weeks I started getting worried about the package being lost or intercepted. Luckily, I had done my homework thoroughly and was pretty confident that I was not in any legal trouble even in worst case scenario.<br /><br />One month went without any news regarding the package. Then two months. I figured I had just lost the money and was a bit sad about this fact. This was by far my biggest order and I thought of it as an investement that would last for a LONG time onwards.

I did not talk about drugs on the phone ever. I never have, but now I made sure all my friends was painfully aware of this. I&#039;d always played it safe on SR, not keeping any incriminated information on my computer or at my residence. Obviously, I didn&#039;t make any new orders either. It is hard to describe how much this fact helped me later on. Even though I only talked to the police - they never searched my computer or my residence, and probably didn&#039;t listen in on my phone calls either - knowing this gave me the necessary peace of mind to confidently deny any knowledge of the package.<br /><br />About the two month mark I received a note by mail from the police, telling me that I was being summoned to come in for questioning in regards to a criminal investigation. No specific information. I was pretty sure it had to do about my missing package, but given how long they must had kept the package without contacting me and that the summoning was so vague that it could be about literally anything made me a bit uncertain nevertheless.<br /><br />Turns out, it was about the package. They presented me with a photo of the intercepted package and told me it was drugs and that I would have to explain it to them. I told them I didn&#039;t know anything about it. I did not try to act surprised or anything, I told myself I couldn&#039;t beat them at this game, I just had to deny it and be confident that they had no real evidence. I really wasn&#039;t. Mentally, I had gone through everything I&#039;ve ever done on SR and figured I was pretty safe, but I couldn&#039;t be absolutely sure. It was very nerve wrecking to say the least.<br /><br />The police officer questioning me probably saw this. I tried to avoid eye contact and just looking down to the floor telling him I didn&#039;t know anything about it. He pressed me on it, told me which address it was sent from and if I knew the location or if I&#039;ve been there recently. He asked if I used to order stuff online and what that would be and if I shared the mailbox with anyone.<br /><br />There weren&#039;t to many questions. He told me that if I admitted to the crime early on, it would really make things easier later. When I made a statement denying knowledge about the package, he would write it down and exaggerate the statement tremendously and asked if this was correct (I had to say yes). I knew that if I was later to be found guilty, the police had really cornered me in this interview and in a way forced me to lie as much as possible.<br /><br />They did also want information about my bank account. I granted them access (they asked for a specific time frame) and thought to myself that if they had some sort of vague evidence, my cooperation could be argued to show that I had nothing to hide. I did this because my bank account had none incriminating information and could only strengthen my defense. If they had any real evidence, they might just test my cooperation and get access nevertheless. Looking back I don&#039;t know if this was the right call, but luckily for me it turned out okay. I was let ago after maybe 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />Again a surprisingly long time passed without hearing any news. I continued to lay low and just doing what I&#039;d normally do.

				I, personally, think it&#039;s good that Silk Road is becoming more and more mainstream not only from an economical viewpoint but from an ideological one as well. A lot of users here seem to think that they somehow have more of a right to be here than newer members or members with lessen computer skills though that isn&#039;t the case. The more people that uses and finds out about Silk Road, the more people there are that have a bit more social and economic freedom in their lives which I doubt DPR or any other person with sound moral values would disapprove of.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like, as previous posters have pointed out, Silk Road is a secret to the media or to the governments over the world. There is already high pressure on governments to shut this market down, but so far they haven&#039;t been able to and I doubt that reddit is going to change that. What it means is simply more users which will in its turn attract more vendors which leads to a higher level of quality products as well as lower prices. Free market at work simply.

I can&#039;t really debate older users vs newer user&#039;s rights, what I CAN confirm is that the longer you are here the more tech savvy bust-resistant you tend to become. Oddly enough Silk Road doesn&#039;t really need to advertise all over clearnet, and this in my opinion is a big mistake anyway. Whether members become an asset or liability to Silk Road sometimes depends on how they found out about The Road to start with. <br /><br />I disagree with second par, in the fact that, we don&#039;t really need a bunch of children in here from reddit, there are already children here already that need to be reeducated on how to use the site and more ignorance won&#039;t help. An example is gatecrashers at a party, yes it is nice they came along, but in reality they go home and take their Tupperware with them. The testimonies I have seen on this thread alone RE reddit is not encouraging in the least. And it is on clearnet which defeats the purpose anyway. Govt.s and LE have not yet been able to shut down SR but that doesn&#039;t mean we should give the finger to caution, pull down our pants, and bend over, and spray paint a big &quot;FUCK ME HERE!! &gt;:D &quot; sign on our butts. Sorry but I like language which is really obvious. <br /><br />But the rest was good. :) Just don&#039;t use reddit.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I figure if reddit was a good thing for SR and DPR he would say so, if it promoted competition on the site and made his site better he would endorse it.<br /><br />He doesn&#039;t because there is an inherent risk and its clearly not worth it.<br /><br />For one I think clearnet discussion on day to day of SR is bad for all of us, its just a matter of time.<br /><br />I like hiding behind TOR and feel if the forums had been based on clearnet from the get go SR would never have got this far.<br /><br />My few times reading on reddit really does make me think its kids (in some cases VERY young) on reddit and it brings the wrong sort of public awareness to the site.<br /><br />/my 2 bit cents
