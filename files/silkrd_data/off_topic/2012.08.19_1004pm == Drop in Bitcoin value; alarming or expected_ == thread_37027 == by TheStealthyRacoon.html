				Ok so it peaked at a crazy value a couple of weeks ago. Those of us who were bitcoin rich were laughing and now it seems the tables have turned and its dropping faster than a fast thing.<br />We worried?

				I think it is expected for bitcoin to be maturing and not be nearly as volatile and easy to manipulate as it was last year. I&#039;m expecting after all this ruckus is over it&#039;ll stabilize somewhere slightly higher than it was at the beginning of this bubble... Of course if I&#039;m wrong and BTC crashes to the point of becoming next to worthless in the long run I&#039;ll be very surprised. Tor and services like SR will guarantee its success, and if either of those things are compromised they&#039;d surely be replaced by newer alternatives.

				Not at all, I expected this to happen when because of how difficult it is for people in some countries to gamble on the Olympics. I think during that cultural event people were spending the one currency that is global so now that it&#039;s over everyone is selling there BTCs. I&#039;m predicting the will drop down pretty low around $4 US dollars and then stabilize back at 5 for a while.

				I&#039;m only crying because I went out of town this weekend and didn&#039;t expect to drop 50%, now I&#039;m being forced into vacation mode until it stabilizes&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />Other than that though it shouldn&#039;t really hurt buyers unless of course you bought in at $14 and now your coins are now worth $7, but hopefully buyers are smarter than to hold onto their coins before making a purchase

If pirateat40 does start paying people back a lot of people are going to have btc they didnt have access to and with all the panic going around a lot of them may sell. If he doesnt pay people back but starts selling them off we have the same issue. I really dont know which way this will go, too many factors and unknowns but my gut says tomorrow will bring lower prices and it will stabalize over the course of the wee.

Sure it would be good if you plan on speculating and buying a lot but it could be very bad for SR at least in the short term. Personally as a vendor I am being hit very hard by this. Sure there is hedging but hedging only exists while in escrow and I personally keep a fair amount of money in btc because cashing out is a complicated process for a vendor and I need btc to restock. My restocking is put on hold until things normalize and potentially until I have the money if things normalize too low. A huge blow to the market could scare off or at least hurt some of SR&#039;s best vendors.

				I don&#039;t think BTC will properly stabilize until it&#039;s more widely accepted as a digital currency.&nbsp; No disrespect to those who bought up in bulk looking to make a decent profit, but BTC&#039;s still pretty marginal despite the increasing number of exchanges appearing, and one of the drivers behind it&#039;s introduction - as far as I understood it anyway - was to have a currency that attempted to avoid the capacity for middlemen/speculation, and the destabilizing effect this can have on certain countries currencies - so if you try to speculate on it you need to accept the risk, like any other financial index.&nbsp; I personally would hate to see it used predominantly in this fashion as it defeats the purpose of its ethos. There&#039;s a BTC conference in London in September, and the recommendations from that forum may show how it will develop positively over the next months/year.<br /><br />...just my 0.02 BTC

				I usually spend all BTCs I have &quot;earned&quot; on SR again, too ;)<br /><br />But this whole thing made me realize just how easy it would be to totally destabilize<br />the BTC economy. Afaik there are currently about half of all possible BTCs (20 million)<br />in &quot;circulation&quot;.<br />That is about 100 million $ (10 million BTC x 10$), so with a &quot;little&quot; playing money, anyone,<br />any agency, LE, etc. could buy a very substantial amount of BTCs and play havoc with the market.<br /><br />I also remember having read here or at the BMR forum that ruining the BTC economy might be the<br />easiest way for LE to heavily damage this emerging underground market. It was some kind of interview<br />with the inventor of TOR and others...<br /><br />Or am I wrong here? (I have no background in economics, so this is quite likely)<br />

				The only way to destabilize it, would be to keep moving it up and down.<br /><br />Move it up, we adjust, likewise if they move it down.<br /><br />If they have to move it up and down, that means for some users, LE will be subsidizing their drugs sometimes ;)
