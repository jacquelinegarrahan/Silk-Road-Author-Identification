				No, unfortunately you can&#039;t look up what post or who it was that left negative Karma. <br /><br />Once you reach 100 posts, you will be able to leave karma for others. At least I believe it is 100. Could have changed or I am mistaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;If I disagree with someone, I&#039;ll let them know openly and not in a cowardly manner by leaving negative feedback. And many times when I disagree, I find that discussing the issue usually ends up with a better understanding. <br /><br />That said...&nbsp; here&#039;s some +karma as that is&nbsp; the only kind I give out. :)

				I&#039;m not sure but i think your past posts will show a different -/+ so if you go back to them, you can pin down when it was given (after which post)<br />Most negative karma is given by people that have a differing personal opinion to you, so you have to be aware not to offend anyone.&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Other causes might be jealousy or perceiving you to be reckless with your drug usage.<br />come to think of it i really didn&#039;t think i deserved those -3, I try to be as informative and detailed as possible in my posts, regardless of how long and drawn out they may get.<br />I&#039;ll +1 everyone in this thread when I get to 100 posts.<br /><br />peace, unity and love

				I don&#039;t attack anyone or offend anyone and I have -3. <br />I think this karma&nbsp; puts more stress on others or they wouldn&#039;t be asking why. <br />If anyone has a problem with me, why don&#039;t you message me?<br />Plus some are so damn high on here, they probably have no idea what they are judging, lol<br />so don&#039;t let it bother you, who freken cares I don&#039;t lol.<br />&nbsp;;)

				Keep in mind some people on here are very touchy and it&#039;s hard to gauge someone&#039;s tone over the internet.<br />I got negative karma today! Of course nobody owns up to it or explains. And it doesn&#039;t really matter, some of the posters I really like have more negative than positive karma and I don&#039;t have any idea how that happened. They seems so nice!<br />It would be helpful to&nbsp; know what post gets negative karma so you can figure out what&#039;s going on or change your attitude, you know?.. Or explain yourself. <br />I have great respect for anyone who is willing to have a conversation about something like an adult instead of being sneaky.<br /><br />It&#039;s good to know what the buttons say though, &quot;thank,&quot; and &quot;discourage.&quot; Negative karma doesn&#039;t seem *as bad now.. I was imagining something worse. Thanks CaptinMal.<br /><br />I would give the OP +1 if I could, it is the thought that counts right?

				SO this might help a little:<br /><br />Post Titled &quot;I like Drugs!&quot; will probably net you plus karma.<br /><br />Post titled &quot;I hate Drugs!&quot; will probably net you negative karma. <br /><br />I think most of the time when I get a click of Karma it&#039;s for posting something insightful or helpful and negative karma seems to go to people that right or wrong express themselves differently than the majority (i.e. saying drugs are bad on a site the sells drugs).
