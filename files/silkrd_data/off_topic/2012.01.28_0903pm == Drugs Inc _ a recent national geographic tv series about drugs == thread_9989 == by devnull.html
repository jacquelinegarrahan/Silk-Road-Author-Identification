Turning cartel leaders into billionaires, the illegal drug industry also provides vital income to hundreds of thousands of poor workers across the globe. While some users sacrifice their lives to an addiction they canâ€™t escape, others find drugs to be their only saving grace from physical or emotional pain almost impossible to overcome.

				Watched the one on hash, crack, and X. Interesting, but as blueangel said they are more against the drugs than staying in the middle.

				Ive seen a few of them but what I really hate is how they always say that by buying drugs you are paying people who are peoplesmugglers. Its so dumb. And when they talk about the violence drugstrade creates, its only there because the government denies us lawyers and fair court if we have problems in our work. Its the government who is mentally fucked up, not us. Then again, I still think its funny to watch the parts with the dealers :)
