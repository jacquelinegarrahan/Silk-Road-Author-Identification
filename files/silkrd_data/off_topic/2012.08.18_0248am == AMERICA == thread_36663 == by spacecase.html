				I tend to think that people really over exaggerate the greatness or fairness of the USA government in the past as well.&nbsp; I mean sure our government is corrupt as fuck and completely worthless today, but all the same women and blacks had absolutely no rights and there was horrible inequality everywhere. Sure the world sucks today, but it was probably an even shittier place back then all things included.&nbsp;
