				Hey, does anybody know the legalities involved (in the US that is) of walking on the street wearing a surgical mask? I&#039;ve seen people do that, apparently without any complication. We&#039;ve all seen how in Asian countries people are so afraid of SARS and other diseases that they routinely wear them on the street.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know for how long you could walk with a mask on in the new US police state. I mean, those cameras are there to catch you, right? Trapwire and all that. If you purposely foil the man&#039;s plan, you&#039;d be in trouble (?).<br /><br />Ditto for going into buildings wearing a mask: post offices, federal buildings, banks (ha ha ha!). Anybody know for sure if there are rules/laws against any of this?<br /><br />goblin

				This is going to sound racist but unless you&#039;re of Asian descent its a look you can&#039;t pull off without attracting attention.<br /><br /><br />that being said if you are of Asian ethnicity and wear it you will attract attention also

				As I understand it, your take on this is wrong.<br /><br />I was told that Asian people wear masks when they have coughs or colds out of concern for others.

				IMO the worst that could happen is cops/rentacops might stop you and ask what you&#039;re doing, to which you would respond &quot;I&#039;m walking down the street&quot;. It&#039;s not illegal, but that won&#039;t stop people who can&#039;t mind their own business from calling someone to complain.<br /><br />I remember reading a jogger was wearing a training mask (they look like gas masks) and he was stopped by the cops after someone called 911. Fuck, people...
