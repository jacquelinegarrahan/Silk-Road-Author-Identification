				Hey all, trying to some MDMA and LSD on a 5 day cruise, company is Carnival. Any tips? I&#039;m assuming just filling up a vitamin c bottle with vitamin c, then putting a few caps worth of mdma in the bottom would suffice? and the LSD inside my wallet?<br /><br />Any tips would be very helpful.

				should be fine if they don&#039;t have dogs and you don&#039;t act sketch. just don&#039;t fly off the edge of the ship when you&#039;re fucked. what&#039;s the appeal of a cruise for you, just out of interest?

				I admittedly don&#039;t know dick about this sorta stuff, but what about using a jonny (condom) and putting in your shampoo or shower gel?<br /><br />Like I say i don&#039;t have any experiece and it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if a million people have already tried and failed using this method. Literally the first thing that popped into my head, alternatively...<br /><br />SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASSSSSS!

				I have been on a few cruises and I feel it is one of the least scary smuggling personal amounts.,&nbsp; I would though bring one or the other unless your gonna drop both. I smuggled a few J&#039;s and some molly on my last cruise and it went fine. We smoked the first 2 nights then dropped the 3rd and it was a blast except it was obvious we were on x, we had no issues but I think it wouldn&#039;t be hard to go search your room if you get outta hand or people complain. I honestly taped em under my nuts and walked through like I owned the place lol. We didnt get messed with until we had to pass customs when returning.

They pulled people to the side randomly and checked bags ect, I have done 3 cruises and have made it through every time no hassle. I might add I look like a pothead so im surprised I haven&#039;t been profiled yet. I didn&#039;t see any dogs pre or post cruise but obviously that&#039;s not to say they were not there. Ive known numerous people who snuck booze on in there checked bags so I don&#039;t think they go through your stuff to thoroughly.<br /><br />You could always take say a gram of Molly and mix it with x amount of water and then just measure out your dose by ML of water get what im saying.<br /><br />or say 16 oz water with 1000mg of x in it, every ounce would be 62.5mg.<br /><br />

				Advice:<br /><br />If you&#039;re bringing powders then put them in capsules and mix them in your bottle of herbal supplements. Weed, use your imagination, but you can blend them in a pack of smokes.

				Most cruise companies have Israeli security on board.<br />Used to live in a cruise port and local news delivered a steady stream of news about cruise passengers caught because smoke could be smelled outside their cabin.<br />Never came across a case of drugs without smelly weed though.<br />

				As I have been on&nbsp; a few cruises with good ol carnival I have 2 cents to put in.<br /><br />As long as your only taking a tiny bit,&nbsp; pop it in a vitamin bottle, leave it in your bag you check, get on board and your bag will be delivered to your room.&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy Peasy.<br /><br />You have no big issues getting it on,&nbsp; however I have seen a dog or two coming off,&nbsp; and I personally would not bring it back off with you at the end.&nbsp; &nbsp; (altho im sure you could)<br /><br />Other then that, don&#039;t act a fool and you should have no problems on board either.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are always people who start drinking the second they get on the ship and drunk before you even set sail.&nbsp; &nbsp; So unless you get all crazy and strip and run around screaming, your fine.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I knew a guy who actually did the smuggling on a cruise ship with a golf bag.&nbsp; They cut the bottoms off the golf clubs and packed the bottom of the bags with weed, and then threw them off the side to a speed boat when they were almost back home.&nbsp; I know I saw the same thing in a movie with coke, but this guy was for real about doing it with weed.

				With all these great suggestions, the next in line would be.<br /><br />Buy you a cruise ship, and then do not check your own bags when you get on or off.&nbsp; &nbsp; Easy as pie.

				Thanks for all the advice, here&#039;s how we did it:<br /><br />MDMA: smuggled inside a small baggie inside the bra of a female in our party, also put about 10 caps in a vitamin c container and put that in my checked bag. Everything came through fine.<br /><br />LSD: Inside a baggie between credit cards in my wallet.
