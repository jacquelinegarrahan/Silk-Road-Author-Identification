				Okay so Bruce Springsteen was playing at Hyde park, Paul McCartney &amp; Tom Morello come out for an encore and the organizers pull the plug right in the middle of the song. I&#039;m not big on Bruce but what is up with that? I figured Paul McCartney got the same respect as the Queen. You, never, never, unplug that man&#039;s PA.

				That sucks, I can`t believe they would pull the plug on them. Tom Morello`s quite the DJ on the guitar. That trio is quite a rare sight, its unfortunate they had to disband. Any videos of it online?

				Yeah well until you Yanky-Doodle fucks stop making shit versions of our sitcoms (The Office and Peep Show to name but a few) we are just gunna do what the fuck we like I&#039;m afraid. You need to start spelling things correctly as well because &quot;organise&quot; isn&#039;t spelled with a Z and &#039;colour&quot; isn&#039;t spelled without the U. <br /><br />Also come on, Paul McCartney is just some daft scouse twat with an annoying voice that married a one legged slapper-harpy that took him to the cleaners (she used to do glamour modelling). He used to be cool back in the day but he ain&#039;t the Queen, the Queen is Britain&#039;s Nan. If you think Paul McCartney is on the same level as the Queen that&#039;s like saying a Muller Crunch Corner is the same as say....I dunno some very fucking nice an expensive yoghurt. It&#039;s kinda amusing that the OP thought that McCartney got the same respect as the Queen though. I guess that&#039;s what a classless society does for ya! :P

				Yeah exactly. And don&#039;t get me wrong, I like Americans, you guys are alright when you are in your own country which I have been to several times and enjoyed it no end. Your birds have got nice fannies too, props for decent vaginas. HOWEVER saying that when you venture out beyond your borders you do tend to think you can do whatever the fuck you want and there are several examples of when this has got you into a spot of bother - <br /><br />Vietnam<br />The Contras<br />Iraq<br />Afghanistan<br />That thing where your people fucked up and got shot down over the Commie country (China or Russia, can&#039;t remember which). <br />All the times when you annoy us when you come here and annoy us in London by thinking that everyone in England lives in London. <br />ALSO WHEN YOU COPY OUR FUCKING SITCOMS. STOP NOW. <br /><br />This is just another one of those times when you overstep the mark a bit even though you have been told the situation but ignored it because you are America. Liz needs her shut-eye, she&#039;s an old girl now. If she says x-time, she means it and she ain&#039;t gunna give a shit about some scouser lol.

For fucks sake they were almost done. It&#039;s not everyday you get to do a duet with a member of the BEATLES. Am I wrong? I meant no disrespect to any Brits, just the ORGANISERS.&nbsp; I&#039;m not losing sleep over this or anything, I think they could of let it fly though.<br />Limitless, I couldn&#039;t agree more about the sitcom rip offs. I&#039;ll take Gervais over Carell anyday. I&#039;m not even gonna get started on that though, btw Adult Swim is responsible for us Americans enjoying the Office, so props to them!<br />I def think Paul McCartney has more of a worldwide fanbase than the queen, so thats all I meant by the respect thing. <br /><br /><br />

				Man we make shitty versions of your sitcoms cause we weren&#039;t meant to do what we like, we Americans were meant to like what we do, which is live. <br /><br />We have shitty sitcoms because our government has fallen to the Corrupt John Adams view of Godliness in power, and television isn&#039;t what we like, it&#039;s jazz, it&#039;s the road, it&#039;s exploration, but we killed all the buffalo so all that&#039;s left is the Most Holy for us, Drugs, Drugs, Drugs, and then Death. <br /><br />As that finest of fools Salvador Dali said, &quot;I don&#039;t do drugs. I am Drugs.&quot; This is America, for America is God and God is surreal in his reality. Beautiful.

				I really liked the image of Britain in the 80-90`s. The Prodigy being my favorite artist from there. Now things seemed to have changed, and they`re having lots of problems including segregation caused by communities made up of immigrants closing themselves off with the rest of the nation. I`ll be going to the UK in October, I hope it`ll be a great insight even though my friend claims its a shithole.

				@thomasm13<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how old you are mate but to say brits live life any less than americans is complete bollocks.<br />The obesity rate in america for starters is so much higher than here, the death rate by gun crime goes without saying, and drug related deaths in america is probably a lot higher too.<br />We brits can party hard just like any other nation, with the added bonus that in general we dont have to worry about being shot after getting mugged for a watch.<br />I am not slating americans here, i am just saying that to say one nation lives life more than any other is naive, and to use the term again, bollocks.

				Kurt cobain didnt kill himself mate.&nbsp; The police reports at the time said that the gun shot wound could not have been self-inflicted.<br />How you can say that about a gun shot though i dont know.&nbsp; They suspected that crazy bitch girlfriend of his for a long time.&nbsp; Its just they couldnt find anything to pin on her.<br />To this day i still think that bitch did it, shes certainly looney tunes enough.
