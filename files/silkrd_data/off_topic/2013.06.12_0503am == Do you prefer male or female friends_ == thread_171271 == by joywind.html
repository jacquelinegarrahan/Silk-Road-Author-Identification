				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s good for men to have close friendships with each other.<br /><br />I prefer the company of women to men<br /><br />You can lose your mind around women, they don&#039;t care about politics or intellectual topics, they just want to have fun<br /><br />And because of their submissive nature they&#039;ll rarely challenge you on things<br /><br />I always end up fighting with my male friends

				Sounds like you might have an alpha male mindset. No offense, it&#039;s natural :)<br /><br />When it comes to friendship, I don&#039;t care about gender. Like, at all. The person just has to be open-minded and down to earth, that&#039;s pretty much the only requirement someone must meet to be friends with me :)

				sounds like the op has a beta/#yolo mind set... have fun sure... but cant be having fun all day everyday.<br />There will be a time when work will need to be done<br /><br />an alpha male would not give 2 fucks about who they are friends with, as long as they tick all the boxes.<br /><br />An alpha male would accept a challenge and accept if they are wrong... not always trying to be an authority figure over someone.<br />And also, they would be embraced by their group friends, not end up having fights with all of them<br /><br />Sounds like a big fish in a small pond to me<br /><br />

				I think both are good. Although for a male to only have female friends wouldn&#039;t feel right. It would feel like something is missing.<br />I think men and women need to have friends of the same and opposite gender. It also helps them give more perspective.
