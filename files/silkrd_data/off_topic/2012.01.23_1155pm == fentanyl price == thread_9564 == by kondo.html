That&#039;s in GBP, though, idk what the American conversion would be.<br /><br />Let&#039;s do some guesstimation, though. Currently, on SR, there&#039;s a ~5mg patch for $100, and a ~10mg patch for $230. We can conservatively estimate the retail value to be $20/mg. Since there&#039;s 1000mg in a gram, that would be a retail price of $20000/g. Now, hopefully the &quot;bulk&quot; would mean you get a lower price, and assuming this person is a &quot;great&quot; friend, let&#039;s say you&#039;re getting it for $5000.<br /><br />We also must bring into question the quality of the product. Who knows what purity this product is at? IIRC the three DEA fentanyl busts I&#039;ve heard about (1g each) ranged from 60%-80% purity. The lack of purity means it&#039;s worth less. It also might be &quot;China White,&quot; which are any of the 12 (known) clandestinely produced analogues of fentanyl. As I understand it, these are commonly produced on the cheap in Russia, and would significantly reduce the cost of the product, which means it could be sold for less.<br /><br />You might want to find more information about it.
