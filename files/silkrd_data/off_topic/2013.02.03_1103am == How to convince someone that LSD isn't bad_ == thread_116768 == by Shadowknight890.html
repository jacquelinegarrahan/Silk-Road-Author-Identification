				LOL back at longhair! +1<br /><br />We hear you OP, our wife is not-anti drug, but drugs just don&#039;t seem to love her back, except a tiny toke now and then.<br /><br />She truly is such fun stone cold sober that we wish she would somehow push through and trip in a +ve way just once, maybe one day, but until then, we go easy...<br /><br />If&nbsp; &#039;this&#039; (you typed &#039;his&#039;) :) chick means something to you, we recommend you focus on getting her heart first, and then, and only then... let her mind follow.<br /><br />Which minds us of the song by En Vogue &#039;Free Your Mind&#039; (and the rest will follow) that song was about color, but prejudice is prejudice, the word &#039;prejudice&#039;, as you know, means to &#039;pre-judge&#039;. <br /><br />We&#039;re&nbsp; not trying to be condescending, but to give you some tips on maybe how to approach her next time, for instance use color prejudice as an example (if you and she are otherwise liberal in that way, and we trust you are in 2013CE).<br /><br />Having said that, maybe the best way is to just drop it for now. The conversation, not the acid.<br /><br />And let the Gods of Acid find the right time to re-introduce the concept to her.<br /><br />Women, in the right mindset (schooled on how deal with any emotional baggage they did not pack for the trip) invariably LOVE acid, not least because of the beauty and overall heart-opening this incredible chemical induces in oneself.<br /><br />Good luck, we hope she sees the light(s) one day!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Very insightful replies! Lol, but yeah thing is, I told her I tripped and that got her pissed so now she&#039;s not talking to me haha, oh well. I guess you can&#039;t convince the blind. Not gonna lie, I was the same way back until The Acid gods came to me, but I also wasn&#039;t THAT close minded about acid.

				heyy! <br />3 more posts and then you can deal karma, Shadowknight890 Welcome! :) <br /><br />Man... she has been gotten to by the system well and truly. But, never give up hope... this is a gonna be bombshell here on the road, but...our first job was LE, seriously! <br />We left with an honorable discharge, went to the Caribbean to figure out what next.. and was toking like a Rasta before our severance check came through! <br /><br />So... keep the faith, if we can turn 180 on just about everything we were taught as a kid... there is hope for everyone.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				You could give her some electric cool-aid, but that would probably end up being a bad go. If she won&#039;t even blaze a doob with you, acid is gonna be a hard sale. And if you can&#039;t be open with your woman about everything it doesn&#039;t sound like the relationship is going to go anywhere.

				simple... give her the facts. we are taught a lot of misinformation about drugs growing up. it&#039;s a matter of re-education. i hope she&#039;s open-minded! read about the pros on wikipedia and talk to her about what you&#039;ve gained from lsd.

				Even if she agrees to take it tomorrow, it is not recommended, since she has had a strong believe it is &quot;bad&quot; for so many time. She could end up having a bad trip, even with low dose. Also what is exactly the reason you want her to take LSD, since she clearly states she want nothing with it. If you really want her to do it, don&#039;t force it to her, do it indirectly, make her want it and reach out for it. You must plant the idea in her head Inception style.

				I noticed that when I was single, making $250,000 a year, driving nice cars and motorcycles and weighing 90 pounds less it was a lot easier to convince girls to do whatever I wanted them to. Anal sex, blow jobs, dishes, drugs, threesomes... anything really. Now poor, bald, fat and married I have the damnedest time convincing people that I am the sort of role model they should blindly obey.<br /><br />To rephrase the above true story somewhat differently, you need a worm on the end of your hook or they just aren&#039;t going to bite. If a girl is ape shit over you they will do just about anything (equally true the other way around as well). This chick being turned off by acid is code for I&#039;m just not that into you... <br /><br />I&#039;m with you, I have a girlfriend that I know would love MDMA but for the life of me I can&#039;t convince my wife she is a lesbian or the girlfriend that drugs are good. I lost my worm...

				Hey dude, what you need to do that will most likely work in your favor, is drop a tab and go hang with her, she will see what it does to you, or dont do in this case(make you want to base jump off your roof) and she will have no choice but to conclude that all shes ever been told about LSD is all false. Much love dude.

I&#039;m an MDMA lover myself and love the way that it has expanded my definition of love and understanding. The same goes for LSD and Shrooms as well. Some people have learned important and life changing lessons on these substances and they just want to share that experience with those they care about but the social programing for drugs being bad is hard to overcome.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s a lot like religion. If someone finds happiness in god they want to share it with people. If someone finds meaning through some chemical they ingest the desire to share is just as strong. <br /><br />Clearly there are negative aspects to this since not everyone needs god or chemical understanding and pushing it on them is wrong. But like the born again christian, those of us who have been converted will often try to convince our friends and those closest to us that they too should give it a go.
