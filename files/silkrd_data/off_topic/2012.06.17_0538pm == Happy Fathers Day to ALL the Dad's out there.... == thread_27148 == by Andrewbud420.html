				damn, my parents, especially my dad are so anti-drugs that even if they caught me on this website they&#039;d probably dis-own me. Wish i could smoke a J or something with him someday :-/<br />its so hypercritical though because his caffeine intake is waaaay above average and his alcohol consumption is also high. if it was anything else its as if it were the anti-Christ or something.
