				Whatever you do with your ass or mouth is none of my concern. It really is nobody&#039;s business but your own, unless you go around trying to rape dudes in the ass or something, which I doubt you do considering you seem humble and sincere.

Gay AND straight!<br /><br />I&#039;m straight. Really I am!<br /><br />Sexuality is a tough issue for many... I think have about four or five gay close friends. They are all fuckin awesome.

				I&#039;ve never had a problem so far. People around here seem to be more tolerant/accepting than most places, especially for an online community. Regardless, we&#039;re all here for the same underlying cause, so your sexuality is just as unimportant as your skin or hair color.<br /><br />sdesu

				10thplanetjj you would think right? it is 2012 but remember the world is not run by intelligent aware individuals. Look at politics and the fact that we would all be incarcerated just for what we do on this site. I know someone recently who got beat to shit for being gay, it is far from non issue for anyone who sees bullshit every day. Same with racism and any other issue that is based on ignorance, as long as there is a minority in any sense they will have to fight the majority who doesn&#039;t give them a second thought. I still get people who assume that I&#039;m dumb because I sign (American Sign Language) isn&#039;t that absurd?<br /><br />I think this thread was fun just to see people bring out their nonchalant progressiveness. Much love people.

				Racism and homophobia are actually not acceptable in my world. i can only express sincere compassion for all those persecuted for simply being who they are. <br /><br />So for all fucks that don&#039;t r3ealize they are simply indoctrinated to believe certain beliefs and have trauma from their upbringing leadeing them to seek to hurt other individuals verbally or shit... physically... fuck you. you are the minority. Not welcome, not accepted in most social circles... at least in my world. But my worlds a bit abnormal. <br /><br />But again. this site, this place is much more accepting than much of IRL. I love how we display ethics and morals never expected on an underground market. It&#039;s like I&#039;m waiiting for the articles to start praising this community for the role modeling examples!

				Gawwwwwd SAKE this thread pretty much made me despair of life for 30 seconds. <br /><br />1. Who gives a flying fuck what you like to have sex with as long as it isn&#039;t children or animals or done as a rapist? This point is doesn&#039;t even need to be said so I dunno why it&#039;s been asked. <br /><br />2. Like it matters what % of SR is what anyway, even if a high % of any sexuality was present here it wouldn&#039;t mean a jot. <br /><br />3. This is my biggest bugbear on this issue. WHY is what sexuality you are so inherently important in defining individual identity as a whole because I assure you it fuckin well shouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure why some people feel the need to express themselves solely based on the sexuality because it makes you less of a human being. I certainly wouldn&#039;t want the first and only thing I told someone or ever wanted to discussed be my sexuality, it just turns you into a stereotype lol. And I&#039;m sorry to say that I think anyone thinking people&#039;s sexuality doesn&#039;t matter here are wrong, people&#039;s sexuality doesn&#039;t matter at any time apart from in two main moments that occur in life. The first of these is you want your penis or vajayjay to come into contact with someone in particular&#039;s penis or vajayjay, then it matters a lot lol, the other is when you are coming to terms with your own sexuality when you are growing up. That is all. Ever. It pisses me off how sexuality is regarded as such an important factor now when it&#039;s not and it fucks people&#039;s heads up to make them think it is. Like when you fill in forms and it sometimes asks what sexuality you are or your relationship status there should be a box for &quot;MIND YOU&quot;RE DAMN BUSINESS CUNT&quot; because questions like that are by there very nature, fucking intrusive. Why this needs to be talked about on an anonymous forum which hosted on the hidden service is bloody beyond me. Just go and be happy and comfortable with yourself. That is what is important in life. <br /><br />Oh and just so we are all clear, any bender, rug munchers, fanny pounders (if you are male, oh and fanny means vagina in this case Americans, not your weird use for it) or cock sitters (if you are women) are welcome to spend there BTC with me because I don&#039;t care and don&#039;t actually really want to know what you do. I don&#039;t even care if you are male and you get your Mrs to give you a pokey-bum-wank. It&#039;s not something I would want personally but yano, each to their own. Go crazy if it makes you happy, I&#039;d just advise not to lick her fingers afterwards.<br /><br />PEACE OUT NINJAS!

				But why should it define your character? I have plenty of gay friends and a couple of lesbian mates as well and they don&#039;t let their sexuality define them as individuals. In fact, if they did I probably wouldn&#039;t associate with them. IMO if your sexuality defines you as an individual then sorry, but it makes you less of an individual because nobody is whole if they constantly focus on their sexuality. In fact I imagine doing that would only be done because they lack security within themselves or something like that. It&#039;s fuckin bollocks, get over it and start being interesting. I and nobody else finds your sexuality interesting be you straight, bi, gay, lesbian or whatever the fuck ever. It&#039;s not deep or mysterious and certainly not fascinating. You are just like a vast number of other people in the world. End of story lol. <br /><br />

				Lim I agree with you completely. I just have always kinda noticed out of so many fucked up people out there... that gay people tend to have serious challenges regarding themselves in relation to society and how society views THEM. I think the more well adjusted people... generally have few issues with it. Probably similar or like your friends who don&#039;t give a fuck. But recently I&#039;ve started to realize that there&#039;s a persecuting theme amongst much of the hetro discriminating community which does have an effect on many gay people experience. <br /><br />I always wondered why so many gay people I&#039;d randomly see or meet or talk to... seemed to have serious issues. And it wasn&#039;t until recently I made a cool friend of a bi chic (yayah!) and she confirmed to me that much of the fucked up dysfunction in gays is directly related to society&#039;s consensual rejection of them. A serious plight if you will. Constant. Until one finds who you are and stop giving a fuck. <br /><br />Unless, can you shed some alternate insight? <br /><br />I think it will or IS taking THE paradigm shift in the world that&#039;s tipping consensus on acceptance. This place here, IMO is fuckin great for that shift.

				Associating yourself with being any sexuality is just as relevant as any other cultural identity. You cannot say being black, gay, muslim, old, deaf, and/or rich doesn&#039;t give you cultural identifies that add to a persons character. These aren&#039;t irrelevant they are use to help a person figure out who they are and among people meeting for the first time they help find common ground. <br /><br />Removing the individual from conversation is just plain boring my man and I&#039;m sure you and everyone you know have cultural identifiers you are proud of and share, that is what makes meeting new people great. If we all removed such things, such a dry world this would be.

And because it&#039;s relevant in these circumstances it&#039;s necessary for people to make it known. Ok, perhaps not in all circumstances - it obviously has no relevance to SR - but for socio, cultural, and political reasons it&#039;s important for people to be able to be visible in order for &quot;society&quot; to change (also, I don&#039;t think &#039;society&#039; made it an issue to mind-fuck with people - would you think the same thing if we were talking about race? When people were fighting for equal rights in relation to race would you advocate that those who were pale enough to pass as white and thus gain a privileged place in society continue to do that? Or stand and fight for their rights?)<br /><br />Society and the laws, policies, and legislation it contains to control our behavior was created by white, middle-class, heterosexual, men who created a society to fit their needs (look at members of parliament, or congress...they&#039;re all still nearly male and white!). Surely there&#039;s an imperative for people with differences to stand up and say &quot;hey, i&#039;m not like you, you&#039;re not better than me, and I don&#039;t agree with what you stand for&quot;.<br /><br />Declaring your sexuality is an attempt to gain collective visibility and thus attempt to create cultural and political change...and this is surely a good thing.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m aware this isn&#039;t relevant to the SR community, just thought it needed to be said - food for thought! :)

				I&#039;ve found that most people under the age of 30 are totally comfortable with the idea of people being gay and associating/hanging out with gay people. I have friends all across the political spectrum and all of them support gay marriage... they include progressives like myself all the way to libertarians. Also have a few gay and lesbian friends and relatives.<br /><br />30-50 year olds seem mostly cool with it. Its those older where you get into problems. I guess they just are not used to it, since homosexuals had to hide who they were during there day. <br /><br />I myself have a gay godmother and have parents that raised me correctly to be open minded and not judge. When I have children I will do the same. I think in 20 years we are going to look back at this time and wonder what the hell some people were thinking and it will be difficult to understand the opposition that close minded people have right now.<br /><br />Obviously lots of very religious people have problems of homosexuals but they have bigger issues then that.

And because it&#039;s relevant in these circumstances it&#039;s necessary for people to make it known. Ok, perhaps not in all circumstances - it obviously has no relevance to SR - but for socio, cultural, and political reasons it&#039;s important for people to be able to be visible in order for &quot;society&quot; to change (also, I don&#039;t think &#039;society&#039; made it an issue to mind-fuck with people - would you think the same thing if we were talking about race? When people were fighting for equal rights in relation to race would you advocate that those who were pale enough to pass as white and thus gain a privileged place in society continue to do that? Or stand and fight for their rights?)<br /><br />Society and the laws, policies, and legislation it contains to control our behavior was created by white, middle-class, heterosexual, men who created a society to fit their needs (look at members of parliament, or congress...they&#039;re all still nearly male and white!). Surely there&#039;s an imperative for people with differences to stand up and say &quot;hey, i&#039;m not like you, you&#039;re not better than me, and I don&#039;t agree with what you stand for&quot;.<br /><br />Declaring your sexuality is an attempt to gain collective visibility and thus attempt to create cultural and political change...and this is surely a good thing.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I&#039;m aware this isn&#039;t relevant to the SR community, just thought it needed to be said - food for thought! :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You get all the karma.

				We are a community. I feel like if we want this place to strive, not only do we need to support the actual market, but we also need to support each other.&nbsp; I believe that these forums should serve as a healthy and supportive environment (I know it&#039;s not always this way--I&#039;ve seen a fair share of negativity here as well). Sexual orientation shouldn&#039;t matter on SR. Everyone, just have your drugs and be happy!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Everyone is welcome here, in my opinion!

				Pretty much all gay people I have met I have liked. In my experience they tend to be less judgmental of others, more open minded and more liberal (which although is not libertarian, is still far better than conservatism). Many also tend to come across to me as more clear headed and to demonstrate less of the negative stereotypical behaviors associated with males (ie: macho-ism ego)&nbsp; Also I don&#039;t really give a fuck about where you want to stick your penis, as long as the place belongs to someone who is at least Y age old and reasonably able to consent to said penis sticking. I have even gone to very gay parties and chilled , where I was one of the only straight people around (other than the platonic girlfriends of the gay guys, some of whom were friends with me as well, and the reason I was at such parties in the first place) and I enjoyed myself a lot. However I did feel some level of discomfort, but apparently less than others who were invited as most of them left quite quickly after they seeing the level of gayness involved (there would be little chance of mistaking the people as heterosexual). <br /><br />So in short I don&#039;t mind gay people at all, but may become somewhat uncomfortable if I am around men who are wearing womens clothing and making out with each other, but the discomfort is not because I think they should not be doing what they are it is just spontaneous more or less.

				I have a few gay friends, and met a BUNCH of lesbian and Bi friends in college. They all have better relationships than what I&#039;ve seen my straight friends have had. Not always the case but it seems to be to be the standard. And sexuality doesn&#039;t matter to me really, If I knew someone was gay or straight or bi or transgender, it would not deter me from buying wares from them. Thats kinda asinine in my opinion. Not that any of us would ever know that was the case. So I say this community welcomes all, except for the few trolls. I am straight and I love my gay friends. I also listen to Johnny McGovern, i think his music is awesome. So anyways... I don&#039;t think your sexuality would factor into this community, but i also wouldnt invite trolls by advertising it much. But be proud of who you are, just don&#039;t invite hate.

				As much as people don&#039;t wanna believe it I think sexuality is a fluid thing. I think if there wasn&#039;t stigma most people would be bisexual. That&#039;s gonna sound completely nuts to most people &quot;I would NEVER engage in homosexual activity&quot; but that&#039;s because of the way we&#039;ve been conditioned to think.
