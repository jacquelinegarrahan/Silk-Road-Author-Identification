				Hello, <br /><br />In the event where someone would want to plan a trip in Amsterdam and go to a music festival, but that someone doesn&#039;t anyone there...how would he find good quality MDMA/Amphe/Speed? <br /><br />Would there be a way where he could ship the product to himself to a certain location, then pick it up when that someone arrives in Amsterdam?

				My suggestion would be to arrive a few days before the festival starts. Order MDMA from a Dutch vendor on SR and get it delivered to wherever you are staying. As I see it, there would be no point in posting it before you leave. That would be like bringing apples to an orchard ;)

				Go to any club and ask around. This is the drugs capital of the world. In case you arrive just in time for the festival, you will find everything you want there.

				Yeah I was thinking about working with a Dutch MDMA seller, but I am unsure 4 days would be enough, as this is the number of days I have before the festival. I guess I could try and if no luck, well then I could hunt the clubs. We&#039;ll surely got out before the festival anyways...
