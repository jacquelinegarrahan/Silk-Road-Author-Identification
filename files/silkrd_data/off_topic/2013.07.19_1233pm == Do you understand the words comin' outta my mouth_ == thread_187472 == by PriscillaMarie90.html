				Last night I was in outer space after dropping a generous mixture of MDA &amp; 2C-B. My boyfriend was with me, he didn&#039;t want to take any so he babysat me through my trip, and for my (and now all of your) enjoyment he wrote down some of the hilarious nonsense I spewed. He could respond to some things, so his words are here too.<br /><br />To paint a mental picture for you, just imagine me rolling around in blankets, mumbling and making strange noises mostly, but occasionally I&#039;d spout things like...<br /><br />&gt; Don&#039;t put birds on it... it was your rule.<br /><br />&gt; We should watch pickachu... don&#039;t kill me though.<br /><br />&gt; I can see you, stop.<br />&gt; (My BF): Stop what? Stop seeing you?<br />&gt; Yeah.<br /><br />&gt; (Talking about my eyes) They&#039;re little tiny, I mean like, compared to... I dunno, they might as well be the biggest thing out there!<br /><br />&gt; They&#039;re saying get&nbsp; the fuck up, like my song says to.<br /><br />&gt; Ok this is like secret, fuck.. Ok stop talking.. Theres no one else talking but me...<br /><br />&gt; (Talking about myself) I don&#039;t want to talk to that brunette bitch, she&#039;s fucking boring!<br /><br />&gt; I was tryign to connect all of the worlds, I think you just did though.<br />&gt; (My BF): Okay...<br />&gt; You didn&#039;t even know what I&#039;m talking about, but you did it. That&#039;s like SO crazy dude.<br /><br />&gt; It&#039;s so fuckin cool.. it&#039;s like awesome.. don&#039;t confuse me.. see you&#039;re tring to do it again<br /><br />&gt; Am I touching your face right now?<br />&gt; (My BF): Are you?<br />&gt; I don&#039;t think I&#039;m touching your face right now... (I wasn&#039;t)<br /><br />&gt; I wouldn&#039;t know yet, cause you haven&#039;t happened. Cause you are color and I am about to create you, and you are going to be this one color.<br /><br />&gt; My sides hurt and I don&#039;t know how to defend them! By laughing on top of them?<br /><br />&gt; Are you trying to kill me right now? I&#039;m watching you so you don&#039;t try to off me...<br /><br />&gt; I still don&#039;t know who shirley is, what the fuck!<br /><br />&gt; Time.. goes away.. i dont even fucking know.. no i dont.. want.. to..<br /><br />&gt; Yes, no, hi, hello. needs more yellow paper, I don&#039;t know what that means anyway, I guess I could do that then...<br /><br />&gt; OBVIOUSLY I&#039;m not gonna be on the lawn!<br /><br />&gt; (Talking about myself) ..Is it the same person.. hoohoohoh hahaha heee hhooo .. ok then.. ok.. hhahaha hohohoh hehehehe..<br /><br />&gt; Not only do I kill your wife... she looks like she would have dinner in that position...<br /><br />&gt; Danger in the bath time, you auto attack!<br /><br />&gt; Two days, more like two weeks, don&#039;t bully him to death, he&#039;s got kids!<br /><br />&gt; You&#039;re dead young girl, she doesn&#039;t care what you know, which.. she always is a junkie, that&#039;s ok, that&#039;s ok, not while grandma knows...<br /><br />&gt; Let&#039;s keep him there(in the jungle), he&#039;s a jungler you know.<br /><br />&gt; (For some reason I began speaking in a british accent) I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever be in a work store, I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on in there, I popped my jaw for the most meaniest mean in all history<br /><br />&gt; (british accent) We haven&#039;t finished sorting yet... and you&#039;re going to get.. fuck whatever your name is, that&#039;s what she was tryign to fit in your bag<br /><br />&gt; Oh god damn it.. Shen fuck you.. cast fuck, no thanks<br /><br />&gt; (In a really deep voice) DEEP.. heheheheh<br /><br />&gt; As long as I go on a limb for it.. I figure I&#039;m a wolf man on top of this.. on top of this devlish.. I just..<br />oh damn it all, that was last night, that was...<br /><br />&gt; (mumbling in a british accent).. she&#039;s just uhh.. this is not gonna work out I reckon, this is not gonna work out<br /><br />&gt; (british accent) Eat dirty..... eat dirty.....<br /><br />&gt; (Pointing at a water bottle)(british accent) It&#039;s gonna be really cold in this area for the sole purpose of being cold tonight on this exact...<br /><br />&gt; That means we have to go.. bro.. because three means that..<br /><br />&gt; I&#039;m bored.. of this nature.<br /><br />It was a funny night, I hope you all enjoy reading!<br /><br /><br /><br />xoxo<br />PM90
