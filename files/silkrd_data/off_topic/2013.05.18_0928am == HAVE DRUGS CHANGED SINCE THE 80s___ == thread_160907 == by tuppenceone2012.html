				Of course they have; namely, as more drugs have become illegal, people have synthesized new grey area legality alternatives that are often sold as the original.<br /><br />Ecstasy was a late 80s thing originally; when it was banned was when the alternative fake X&#039;s started coming in.<br /><br />Is the pot stronger now? Not really, it&#039;s merely become easier to distribute more potent weed strains due to the internet.<br /><br />Are things cut more often? Depends how new the substance is, but cutting has always been a 20th century onward problem with drug illegality.

Do you know how to synthesize coke? No, so do you know somebody who synthesizes coke, no, so do you know somebody who knows somebody who synthesizes coke? Maybe you do, but by the time the product gets to you it can easily have been already cut. Now pretend you&#039;re morally grey, and want to sell higher volumes of cocaine for less money- you start cutting it yourself.<br /><br />The chemicals themselves aren&#039;t less potent, but just because you&#039;re purchasing a street drug off of Silk Road doesn&#039;t necessarily mean it&#039;s purer.
