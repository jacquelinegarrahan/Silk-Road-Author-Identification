				Been trying to get coins from my vendor friend, they been going up the whole time waiting. Got $700 (2.75). went to p.o lost the dcn number because i accidentally threw the receipt in garbage. had to go back where i threw it away, dig through garbage to find it. then some punk thought it was okay to fuck with me on the road until i blocked his car and he saw i was 3 times his size and he took off. then a 2 liter bottle of soda exploded in my car for no reason. and when i get home i see my 2.75 btc is now only worth $635!! so i lost $65! <br />my kids are grown but daddy still always has to come to the rescue and bail them out. man, sometimes it feels like its me vs the world!<br /><br />I don&#039;t think even the fattest joint relax me.&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; I&#039;m usually a very nice guy. but im not a small man by any means and got a bad temper..hence...the reason i have to smoke.

				It&#039;s only a representation of our behavior. People are cashing out because they&#039;re getting ready for 420.<br /><br />Did you ever notice that leaders, whether LE or military, enjoys irony? They&#039;re planning the largest drug seizure in American history: @USPS. They are human after all... and humans are predictable. Just like everyone here is doing: buying too many things for or on 420.<br /><br />Stop that. If the trends in mail don&#039;t change, then why change them to send a red flag up the chain of command? It&#039;s like troop movements. If too many people move at once, you can be heard miles away.

				Sorry to hear bout your day bro, but I can advise you to hold you coins for a few days and they&#039;ll be back up to price. The invisible hand will see to that.
