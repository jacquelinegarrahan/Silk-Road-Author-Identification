				Bought some white Nintendos that I received yesterday. It was pretty much an impulse buy since I dont rly know what to do with them now. I have recently moved to Spain (around 1 month ago) and I have pretty much zero people here I can hang out with when I&#039;m high. So what should I do? Im thinking of taking them and get a hooker or something and have some cuddle time 8). Anyone think thats a good idea? The alternative is either to take it myself and do a loner roll (feels like a waste) or go to a bar or club (not too keen on that since I think I might get to fucked up to be out in public). <br /><br />So what do you guys think?<br /><br />And if there&#039;s anyone on the Costa del Sol that wanna roll with me, hit me up!

				Go to the beach. Solo roll in the sand. <br /><br />I dunno about you but people/animals tend to gravitate toward me during/after a roll. Might be interesting.<br /><br />Bring extra for anyone who may join you.<br /><br />

				I have enough for several rolls so if I find any cool people I have no problem sharing. I&#039;m not an experienced X user, I have only taking it a couple of times before and that was years ago. Last time I took it was with my fuck buddy at the time and that was pure bliss, best sex I have ever had period. Unfortunately I don&#039;t know any women here that would be into doing X (I think) so that&#039;s why I threw out the hooker idea.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If I don&#039;t get too fucked up I will most likely go out and socialize with strangers. Although its so much more fun when people around you is high as a kite too&nbsp; ;D So if anyone on the south coast of Spain wanna roll, let me know!<br /><br /><br />

				DON&#039;T go anywhere silent. Silence is painful as fuck on Ecstasy. People who take it without music should be sent to penitentiaries.<br /><br />DO listen to Daft Punk&#039;s entire Alive 2007 as well as Feed Me&#039;s BBC Essential Mix if you&#039;re into electronic music. Or go to a rave if available. I haven&#039;t tried much other music with X, but anything soft is a big no-no; I presume some decent rock or metal subgenre would be just as suitable as electronica.<br /><br />DON&#039;T get a hooker. You will likely be bonerless. Ecstasy is also more of an emotional sensuality than it is a sexual sensuality, at least for me and people I&#039;ve spoken with. Very platonic though naked cuddling is great. If you really must have sex, viagra.

I mean, when you go on vacation, do you need someone to tell you what to do to have a good time? I guess some people do, now that I think of it...calling travel agents and the like.<br /><br />Okay...it&#039;s obviously late but I think I&#039;ve made my point in this ramble somewhere.

All you can do in the nature is actually pretty sweet while high on MDMA. Well, I don&#039;t know the differences about pills and crystal but with crystal I&#039;m always going for a walk into the woods, watching sunset or just sky and squirrels messing around. What ever you can imagine about nature. <br />For what I&#039;ve seen, people tend to take up habits too easily but if you do ecstasy only once in a long time you should not always do the same things then like you always do. I suggest even to try out different music even genres you don&#039;t listen or don&#039;t like so much. Much of the music can seem worse than ever but the other half goes up just like that. Take your headphones and download some repetitious structured music like Philip Glass or Ravel&#039;s Bolero but 90&#039;s trance and things like that as well, then take a walk into the nature. <br />Or go just a walk in the city planning to get some ice cream and suddenly see some sweet sweet girl and go for a talk, it works out and even if not you could not care you&#039;re on ecstasy. <br />Ecstasy is so here and now drug but emotional as well that you can do almost anything while on it and you&#039;ll like it. I know much of the people can only think of going for a rave but I find it as best drug for playing with whole life itself. <br />Many times I&#039;ve been going out that way knowing I&#039;m alone today but ended with new friends because it seemed fun on ecstasy to go talk some strangers who hanged out in the park.

				Yeah if it&#039;s warm where you are, go to the beach! Such a good time!<br /><br />But def. bring plenty of water (no joke!), some good music, and a cuddle buddy (if you can). The feeling of the water, rolling around in the sand, and the sun, is just great! Even more so on X! haha<br /><br />Agree with another poster, found when me &amp; friends rolled at the beach, always attracted people over to us somehow!<br /><br />Good fun! :)
