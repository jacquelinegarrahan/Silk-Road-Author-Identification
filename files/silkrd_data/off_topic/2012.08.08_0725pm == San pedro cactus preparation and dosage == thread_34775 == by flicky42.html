				Hey all, I just ordered some San Pedro seeds and have a good deal of questions. I have read everywhere that a 12 inch cactus is a good dose for a single person but this really doesn&#039;t tell me much because each cactus could vary in weight. What do you recommend for a good dose weight wise? Also anyone who has grown this cactus I would appreciate any tips you could give me in starting the growth process from seeds.<br /><br />I am aware this will take a few years but I don&#039;t mind the wait I think it will be really special when I&#039;m done.<br /><br />Thank you.

				You should check out http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/. I&#039;m too lazy to pull out the specific link on dosages, but there is a page in there that will give you length by width approximations you can use as a guide.<br /><br />For what it&#039;s worth you may want to look into Tricho. Bridgesii as well as San Pedro. It&#039;s meant to have a higher alkaloid content that San Pedro, although this will obviously vary from plant to plant. I have one growing right now but haven&#039;t experimented with it extensively as yet.<br /><br />i know it&#039;s years off, but if the Road is still around when you have the experience you should totally post back here :P

Bridgesii haha and am looking to buy a few Peruvian Torch seeds. I will also update as I learn to help out this community for sure. <br /><br />Everything I&#039;m reading is saying about 12 inches so I guess if there is no more information in two years I&#039;m just gonna have to give that a shot.
