				This thread is dedicated to a discussion on where to source sassafras, and strategy to obtaining the oil. <br /><br />Since Ron Paul no longer is selling his sassafras source. I decided to start a thread for sourcing sassafras on your own within the US. As everyone knows, sassafras is a heavily watched schedual I precursor, so extreme caution must be taken when ordering. <br /><br />Ive looked around in numerous places<br /><br />1. ebay<br />2. Alibaba (international trade, P2P)<br />3. Google<br /><br />The main difficulty ive been having with ebay is that alot of &quot;sassafras&quot; oil is synthetic, or the safrole has been completely removed rendering it useless. How will I know if the oil I purchase has safrole? Do i ask them in a round about way?<br /><br />Alibaba, sasafras is everywhere, and dirt cheap. However, your ordering over international borders which is an obvious threat. If your have drop locations, and have a way to send payments anonamously via bank transfer, then this might be ideal.<br /><br />Google-ing websites, is very very hard. Has anyone found any legit websites? It seems the ones i do find im unsure contain safrole, or they have a monthly limit.<br /><br /><br />Any help on this subject would be appreciated!

				A lot of the &quot;synthetic&quot; oil still contains safrole. If you do some googling there is a DEA document where they use a standard marquis reagent test to test for the presence of safrole, it gives the results of color change based on percent content. So you can buy a small sample and test it. Also if that does not work you can always harvest or obtain the bark yourself and then steam distill it to get oil.
