				Wow, It&#039;s been so long...<br />I haven&#039;t been on silkroad in about 4 months, and the first thing i noticed is that the 100+ posts a day at the time posted by limitless and regular hate towards him had disappeared, so I was just wondering a few things about him;<br />Firstly, what happened to him? I remember that he constantly got accused of scamming and just being an all round douche, but was there actually any truth to that that made him leave, or did he just dissapear/make enough to leave?<br />Also, I seem to remember limitless being an admin at one point. Did he do something to get this removed, or am I imagining this? ;D If so, what did he do to get this title removed? As I remember him claiming that he was never an admin, and wanted people to stop saying that he was?<br />One last thing, did he ever sell that big fucking van? That turned out not to even be his? aha<br />I&#039;ve missed so much, but he was the main person that used to post on the forums. :o<br /><br />Anyway, just wondering what happened to him,<br />Locker. ;D

Think DPR removed his title because he used to be a dick to everyone lol. I liked him though, his arrogance was funny. <br /><br />He seems to do it alot, disappear for a bit then come back. So there&#039;s no doubt in my mind he&#039;ll be back at some point.

				He updated about a month or so ago saying he had been in hospital after a heroin OD.<br />His &#039;mate&#039; gave him a line of what he said was coke, but turned out to be heroin. He had never done heroin before so it proper fucked him up.<br />Haven&#039;t heard from him since, sucks because I was close to him on here. <br />No matter what people say, behind all of the arrogance and confrontational attitude he was a decent guy with a very good business (Ordered from him on a number of occasions). If he has taken peoples money I don&#039;t think he would&#039;ve done it deliberately. I hope he does come back soon

				You reckon his od story was true?<br />Kind of odd that he&#039;d just up and leave. Maybe he&#039;s having to deal with the mate who gave him the dirty line. Maybe I&#039;ve been watching too many crime dramas though.
