				The main problem with wow nowadays for me is that the whole rivalry between the Alliance and Horde seems meaningless now. My greatest memories of wow were getting into small parties and hunting Alliance while leveling, raiding and defending the cities and fighting for control of summoning stones and shit like that. <br /><br />Now you can make Alliance and Horde characters on the same realm, which should have never happened, there is no longer any reason to leave Orgrimmar/Stormwind so world pvp is completely dead, and summoning stones are basically just ancient relics with no purpose thanks to the dungeon finder. The lines that used to pit players against each other have been completely blurred, and the faction you decide to make a character on is now a meaningless decision. All nationalism is dead, I used to be all FOR THE HORDE!!!!!! and now I&#039;m just like, who cares.

				Blizzard just cant seem to make up their minds with WoW can they?<br />Although they seem a bit more dedicated with D3, the questing addiction is amazing.&nbsp; However someone asked if they have sorted out all the issues and frankly the only one i had was one day when i couldnt get on the server.<br />Other than that, its been plain sailing.<br />Also i have two friends also with D3 for some time and no issues whatsoever.<br />So im guessing its going to be a typical Blizzard ride, hit and miss baby, yeah!

				Man thank god, I got out of WOW before the first expansion, All that wasted time in a raiding guild ( :::shivers::: at the thought ).

				I really didn&#039;t enjoy Diablo 2, was dragged into playing it with friends and played a pvp sorc doing mephisto runs and other bullshit. I&#039;m leaning on the edge of trying Diablo 3, I wouldn&#039;t even think about it but I&#039;m currently playing Baldur&#039;s Gate 2 again and so in the similar frame of mind.<br /><br />As to WoW, I&#039;d say sell your accounts rather than hanging on. I was in a world leading raiding guild in Everquest for years, I had several accounts and sold my main account for $2,000+ when PlayerAuctions opened it&#039;s doors (yea that long ago). I ended up returning to the game several times, as well as many other MMO&#039;s along the way, including WoW which I found average at best, but I&#039;m so glad I sold my accounts. I&#039;d feel like a complete fool for wasting all that time with absolute nothing to show for it, knowing I could have cashed in on several grand.<br /><br />I know WoW accounts don&#039;t sell for as much as EQ accounts used to, but still, 5-10 years down the road when you look back at what you could have done instead of following the MMO treadmill you will feel slightly better about it knowing you made a profit or at least recouped your subscription fees.

I returned the last time because they opened the Fippy Darkpaw progression server, so everyone started out with no expansions, no mercs, just what was available in classic EQ. Then they begin opening up expansions, very neat for both old school players to reminisce and for people who came to EQ late and didn&#039;t get to experience what raiding for contested mobs in NTOV was like instead of the baby hand holding instanced bullshit they call raiding in games today.<br /><br />Now EQ went Free-2-Play, but put limits on augments, bag capacity, money limits etc, but still it means anyone can experience what it&#039;s like to box a full group together, or box a few chars with mercs without having to pay for the extra accounts.<br /><br />*old man rant* Back in myyy day we had to run for an hour to get our corpses back from a wiped raid. We didn&#039;t have &#039;please try again&#039; instances we could try to progress on every week, a contested mob would spawn and the guild with the most efficient organization (or poopsockers) would get the first attempt, if they wiped there was a guild waiting for their shot, so you didn&#039;t have room to be a failure, had to either grow a pair and man up or get the sand out of your vag and wait for WoW where the candyland raiders live.<br /><br />It&#039;s completely frustrating at times, but combining that with PvP back when I played on Sullon Zek? Imagine 2 or 3 raid guilds fighting a raid mob at the same time, competing for DPS for the ownership of the kill, at the same time the guilds are fighting each other in open world PvP. It was common practice to have a PvP force accompany a raid force for protection, so much fun setting up ambushes in Ssra Temple, destroying entire 50 man raid guilds with a PvP force of 20.

				I&#039;ve jumped into the D3 world as well. Got blazed and used a guest pass but ended up getting into it more than I thought I would, purchased it right then, and by the end of the weekend I had smoked over a quarter of nugs and halfway into Act II on Nightmare difficulty.<br /><br />I think D3 is miles better than D2 was, the main difference is the options combat, at least for me playing a Demon Hunter. In D2 I played sorc, so as a nova sorc it was pretty much a game of herding mobs into large groups and slowly tightening the noose while bashing the same key.<br /><br />With a demon hunter in D3, I&#039;m having a lot of fun trying out different builds, each requiring a different strategy.

				I may be wrong here, but the thing i noticed with a demon hunter is that he or she, uses up energy far more quickly.&nbsp; Especially if you have the rapid fire skill with your crossbow.<br />Which type of character has the most energy in conjunction with spell or weapon usage?<br />I have yet to try out all of the character types.

Somehow riding a boat between continents or sitting at a zone line shouting for someone to invis/sow you so you can hug the zones edge and pray you don&#039;t die while running through 5 zones just to get a group seems like less of a time sink to me than the current MMO standard of having 35 NPC&#039;s in every city with exclamation marks above their head trying to get you to run pointless errands for them.<br /><br />They&#039;re all time sinks though, I mean think about something as simple as auto-sort functions for inventory/bags, so simple to do yet even an MMO as new as RIFT doesn&#039;t have it - they&#039;d rather you pay for your hour a day spent organizing your inventory.<br /><br />It&#039;s still the end all MMO for raiding though, probably 80%-90% of EQ players are raiders and having raided at the top tier in EQ, EQ2, WoW, RIFT, and Vanguard I can honestly say the sheer difficulty and organization required to raid in EQ far surpasses them all, which is where the thrill of raiding lies for me.

				You are totally right about the inventory issue!&nbsp; Jesus i never even gave that a thought.<br />Sounds like i might have to give EQ a try.&nbsp; Diablo 3, out of the other MMOS i have tried such as Eve Online (total grind) and WoW, is awesome.<br />I guess it boils down to finding that perfect MMO that is just right for you.&nbsp; EQ sounds like it might be it.

				Depends on your play style, it&#039;s definitely not a game for everyone.<br /><br />Unlike Diablo, Everquest has SO MUCH CONTENT that it is almost overwhelming for newer players, talking about a game with 18 expansions worth of content - it&#039;s a lot for a new player to wrap their head around. There are very few quests worth doing, and most of those require a group or raid effort, so you&#039;re mostly on your own on how you wish to progress, no hand holding progression of collecting 40 quests and following dots on a map.<br /><br />The majority of players EQ attracted and are still in the game are grinders and raiders, and the majority are max level so it&#039;s difficult to find groups at lower levels, so you&#039;ll be spending most of your time finding good spots to grind out levels. EQ used to be almost mandatory to be in a group except for a select few classes, but now days with defiant gear and mercenaries (similar to followers in Diablo) you can level to max level solo but if you find a good group it&#039;s a lot faster.<br /><br />Now with F2P, you could pay for one account to be your main and then setup several other F2P accounts and multi-box (play multiple characters at once). This way you&#039;re basically your own group and leveling up several characters at once, alt tabbing between them. It gets hectic at times, I used to 5-box but now I just 3-box to make it easier on myself, it&#039;s a lot of fun gearing up your own little group though.<br /><br />Diablo 3 is like a combination of a Baldur&#039;s Gate style RPG mixed with twitch combat of a FPS. I&#039;m enjoying it but at the same time I can&#039;t see how anyone could play this game for long since it&#039;s basically repeating the same game on a step ladder of difficulty levels and then farming the shit out of the the same handful of areas for drops to min/max gear.<br /><br />The appeal to me is the same as a FPS, I can jump in and play whenever and can stop playing at any point. Everquest is an entirely different bag of tricks. You usually have to have a chunk of time, few hours at least, to devote to whatever your doing since you&#039;ll usually be forming a guild group, or waiting for a spot in one, and no one likes someone who jumps into a group only to suddenly have to leave 45 minutes later.

I&#039;ve said it time n time again, anyone that was any good at wow or d2 or any game with a system&nbsp; like this for that matter knows that there was no customization! there was a newb build that made no sense and sucked or there was the build that everyone else was doing. The only difference now is you don&#039;t have to worry about figuring out what everyone else is doing, now you just pick your skills and go. I&#039;m kinda disappointed about inferno... they should&#039;ve made it harder in a different way then in a 1 shot gayness kinda way.<br /><br />edit: there will be pvp eventually.

				I&#039;m not trying to compare it to an MMO, we just got off topic talking about EQ. I said Diablo is more like a mix between a Baldur&#039;s Gate RPG and a twitch FPS. If you took Baldur&#039;s Gate 2, took away the great storyline and replaced it with bullshit, made hordes of mobs in every room and made it fast paced then it would be Diablo.<br /><br />I played Diablo 2 end game for quite a while but I was never a big fan, nova/orb sorcing the shit out of cows all day can get awfully boring. But I&#039;m finding myself with fewer and fewer good games to play, most new games are just utter shit sandwiched between cutscenes, a shit sandwich. But Diablo 3 I will admit is mildly entertaining, doubt it will hold my attention for long but I don&#039;t have much else, hell before I bought it I was spending most of my gaming time having gone back to Rome Total War to play some of the newer mods.<br /><br />I was looking forward to Counter Strike Global Offensive, having been a huge CS fan and played it competitively in CAL. But I got my beta invite and it&#039;s going to be another shit sandwich, albeit a cheap one at $15. Most vets have already given up on it because of shit like fog to prevent long range sniping, and tracer fire.

				Thats a shame about Counter Strike, have many fond memories with that and Teamspeak back in the day.<br />EQ does sound like my cup of tea though.&nbsp; Sounds like something that will keep me busy for good few years.<br />I don&#039;t know why people are complaining about Diablo 3.&nbsp; Whether you accept it or not, online is the way to go now and companies understand that.&nbsp; It is far easier to have an online game with constant updates, than to release a possibly flawed game that stands on its own.<br />Actually leveling up my demon hunter, and i can say its been great fun.

				I agree, it is quite a fun class but demon hunters got whacked by the nerf bat the other day, they&#039;re all up in arms and many are quitting etc. I&#039;ve been through this all too familiar scenario for years with MMO&#039;s and flavor of the month classes so it doesn&#039;t bother me, and I&#039;m not to inferno level yet so I don&#039;t see the issues yet. Next patch will either give them something back or nerf another class, it&#039;s always like that but from the whining on the forums I&#039;m assuming these are a new crop of kids converted from WoW who just aren&#039;t used to getting anal fisted by devs, yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m still using ball of lightning and impale with over penetration, but I got my spike trap upgraded to whatever ability makes it so it has a 2second fuse but does 400% something weapon damage. It&#039;s great for elites/bosses where I can take off running down a hallway leaving trails of traps behind me, lay down caltrops last to slow them while I build hatred back up, then smokescreen, run past them and do it again in the opposite direction.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about D3 so far is the RMAH (real money auction house). Back in D2 days, gold was worthless because of dupes and other exploits that ruined the economy, so rings named stone of jordan were used as the new currency and people bought/sold these for real money. I personally don&#039;t like spending real money on virtual game items but I&#039;m quite used to it from other MMO&#039;s and often sell accounts, but D3&#039;s RMAH legitimizes it which wouldn&#039;t be so bad if it wasn&#039;t a fact that all exceptional legendary items go onto the RMAH instead of the gold auction, so the best geared players are the ones spending the most money (and giving Blizzard their cut).

Demon Hunters were deemed OP, going full balls out attack with glass cannon builds so in patch 1.0.3 they nerfed nether tentacles and IAS (+attack speed %) which pissed off all demon hunters and made a lot of people quit. The ones that stayed started selling off their gear to buy the buffed up natalya&#039;s armor set. Now that people have spent a load of real money in the RMAH to buy this armor, Blizzard is now going to nerf the armor set pissing off these people all over again.<br /><br />Then there are gold farmers like you wouldn&#039;t believe, MMO gold farmers are bad enough but then players can see them and report them or get them killed, with private games these gold farmers are just running auto-it scripts 24/7 on hundreds of accounts. The Royal Crypts had tons of breakables and was being exploited a ton which is why breakables no longer drop anything anymore.<br /><br />The one that will be nerfed next is what I&#039;ve been doing for farming gold, which is Inferno Act I, Quest 2 - Legacy of Cain - you just pop in, go backwards instead of through the gates and you&#039;ll find a cellar door. It&#039;s a 50/50 chance the door is open or closed, if it&#039;s open there is always a purple inside rooting through a treasure chest, an easy kill and he drops loot like a treasure goblin so a ton of gold.<br /><br />People spend a ton of time running through dungeons trying to find treasure goblins, this one you could get the same loot for a 1 minute 30 second run, plus I&#039;ve gotten several lv60 legendary&#039;s doing this as well.<br /><br />It&#039;s really tedious and boring, making me question why I&#039;m even playing but very few good games are out right now, but I&#039;ve been doing this run for days at a hour or 2 at a time. Using vault and smoke screen to quickly run past mobs to see if the cellar is open, I&#039;ve made over 2 mil in probably 10 hours total.<br /><br />That&#039;s not that great considering people post up 400k/hour gold runs, but my gold find is only 150% and that time includes frequent bong breaks, changing spotify music etc. The other benefit is all the gear is lv60+, where most gold runs are done on hell or nightmare difficulty so the gear drops are worth too little to even bother picking them up most of the time.

				Eh....Okay...so with demon hunters, you wanna stack Vit, Dext, Hate regen, and attack speed. Your level 25, so i wouldnt worry to much about a good build yet...But theres plenty of sites with AMAZZZZZING builds. I was level 60 with 50k dps ( before the first ban wave )<br /><br />Got banned for gold duping, and using bots. ( i&#039;d sell the gold for btc )<br /><br />As for d3 in comparison to WoW....D3 IS A MUCH WORST GRIND FEST, where at least with WoW you have multiple years of good game structure ( horrible gameplay... ) but good structure.&nbsp; d3 is pretty much 24/h grind fest with hopes at level 60 you find nice items to sell on the RMAH. D3 gives you this fake feel that stat weights are important, when no matter how you stack your stats, your still gonna kill shit, granted not as fast as being properly stat weighted, but i think you&#039;ll get my point. At least with WoW, you have the added bonus of their being millions and millions of places to read up on how to correctly play your class....<br /><br />With d3, i beat that shit all the way to inferno using nothing more than my pets, Caltrops, vault, and strafe...( and that one spell that makes your arrows shoot like a fucking machine gun. Also, the AoE attack, of raining arrows is very useful in clusterfuck situations.

				Yeah i know what you mean bro.<br />DH seems like a waste of time now.&nbsp; Actually so does D3.&nbsp; When playing solo it can be fun, but playing it with a mate we both get nerfed to fuck so i wonder if its worth it in the long run.<br />Fuck, i might just stick to rpgs like Skyrim and Mass effect.

				Also if anyone hates it and is interested in selling their acct&nbsp; for some coins let me know.<br /><br />I agree as a huge d2 fan, D3 blows...hard. But the RMAH makes the grind totally worth it. <br /><br />It does seem items aren&#039;t selling as much but they are still selling. The trick is don&#039;t try to sell 40+ dollar stuff, sell the $30-40 dollar item for x amount of gold then buy 2 or 3 smaller items that are worth $10-15 and they will sell.<br /><br />The Ias nerf didn&#039;t help the economy or player retention either.<br /><br />Demon Hunters do suck now but if you have one and you have the gold they can still be good. My Dh can farm act 3 pretty flawlessly.

				Each to their own mate.<br />Just because you are a die-hard fan of the series and was disappointed by the sequel, doesnt mean others cant appreciate it for what it is, a hacker-slash mob fest.<br />Having said that ive been playing Skyrim along side it, a different kind of game i suppose but still awesome.<br />I vaguely recall the first Diablo back in the 90s, and the game just seemed to go on forever, every bit exactly the same.

				Yo kryptoz, thanks so much for that link bro, how are you keeping??<br /><br />The idea of a bot specifically made for Diablo 3 sounds very interesting.&nbsp; I might just create another account to give it a try.<br />Do you have more specific details on how it works and what kind of hardware&nbsp; is required e.g pc specs.
