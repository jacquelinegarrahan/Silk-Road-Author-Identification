				LE didn&#039;t just take this guy&#039;s computers, below is copied from one of the articles above:<br /><br />&quot;My storage cubes (HP MicroServers) were confiscated without any regard for the hardwareâ€”the power cords were simply ripped out instead of properly shutting them down,&quot; he wrote in a blog post published Thursday morning. &quot;After finishing the search in my living room, they continued in my bedroom, where they confiscated my legal firearms, as well as my cable TV receiver and my Xbox 360. Despite my statement that all firearms and ammunition were legally owned and registered, having passed all background checks, this was doubted by one of the LKA officers due to the caliber.&quot;<br /><br />The guy is 20 years old. He is not in jail but he&#039;s in a heap of trouble - needs 10,000 euros:<br /><br />&quot;Sadly we have nothing like the EFF here that could help me in this case by legal assistance, so I&#039;m on my own and require a good lawyer,&quot; he wrote in a blog post seeking donations.<br /><br />The article also says this dude isn&#039;t the 1st person busted - a German man was busted because bomb threats were sent through his Tor exit node ... all kind of shocking really, risky business having a Tor relay or bridge or whatever it&#039;s called.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks for posting this, astor.

				Man, this is really messed up.<br />I feel like this is going to be the LE&#039;s newest tactic, since they&#039;re failing pretty hard at taking SR down from the inside, going after people who are doing nothing more than letting information pass through their computers.<br /><br />I&#039;ve said this once, and will probably say it a thousand more times, but fuck the police.

				I think William (the relay operator) realizes the potential importance of his case in setting a precedent in the EU for &quot;common carriers&quot;. He posted a bitcoin address to collect money for his legal defense, and I encourage people to donate. As soon as I mix some coins, I will be donating.

				Predictable, really. Play whack-a-node with TORexits and make people scared to volunteer themselves for the job. Not a sole tactic but combined with other approaches (infiltration, interception, etc.), possibly effective.<br /><br />Interesting legal issue. There shouldn&#039;t be anything illegal about being a facilitator of online anonymity, but &quot;hard cases make bad law&quot;. Which is why I wish the media would lose interest in SR and chase after something else for awhile.

				as expected imo.<br />didnt read that whole article but think I know from the headline..<br /><br />i argued for things like this being a big risk in the #tor chan on freenode last year, but oh no, noone would agree that it would be much of a problem with their magnificent standard templates of excuses from the tor site that youd just post to your ISP when they complain about crime..lol<br /><br />was just a matter of time before they cant hold up anymore and were forced to come down hard. you are bound by your Isp&#039;s license agreement and held responsible for traffic on your own IP.&nbsp; eventually ISPs gonna be pressured to take action against those where crime comes out of to avoid being prosecuted themselves,&nbsp; no matter who else you blame it on and what excuses you have, maybe some were slack but that cant last..<br />this is why Id never never ever dear setting up an exit-relay and allow random anonymous people surf with my IP and risk people distributing childporn,spam,scam,plan terrorism etc. on an IP Im responsible for that may appear as me.. crazy if you ask me, surely wouldnt last forever imo.<br /><br />ohwell, besides many isps disallowing running tor nodes anyway even if you setup a non-exit relay cos the ip gets blacklisted many places, shouldnt be as much of a problem for SR for now I think, besides possibly losing extra nodes, as they cant say for sure what the internal (encrypted) node traffic (over .onion domains) as here on SR is used for, alot used legitimately for chinese dissidents,journalists and the likes.. guess it just depends how important they think it is to allow these people to continue with that vs. all the crime (like SR) that is bound to be included.<br />I bet over time shits gonna happen more here too somehow, theyll prolly call it &#039;most likely facilitators of crime&#039; or something like that (and correctly so) and force tor-nodes over on short-lasting compromised botnet-style nodes or something, if at all continued.. <br /><br />hopefully will be solutions or alternatives by then..

				Since SR depends on Tor, I don&#039;t think it would be an exaggeration to say that William Weber is part of our extended SR &#039;family&#039; and that he needs our help. <br /><br />This may well be a precedent setting case and precedents cost money.&nbsp; If you think Tor is worth defending please donate BTC if you are able.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m going to try to follow this case ...&nbsp; [steps off soapbox &amp; says thank you]

				It&#039;s interesting that you can look up his donation address in the block chain<br /><br />https://blockchain.info/address/1CPKAMtD4bcLrh8SRHfSxBBMmQQ5cqahPZ<br /><br />and see that he has received 199 BTC, which is almost 2500 USD at the current exchange rate.
