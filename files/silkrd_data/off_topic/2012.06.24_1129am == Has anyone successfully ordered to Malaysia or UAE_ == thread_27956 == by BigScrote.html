				So I&#039;m going on a trip to Asia and I understand they&#039;ll cut off your sack for just thinking about drugs in Malaysia, but got me wondering if anyone&#039;s shipped to countries like this before (e.g. countries like Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, etc). <br /><br />Really just curious more than anything - don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be taking that chance.

				Ordering to Asia should definitely be possible, but do remember that shipping will take at least 7-14 days, sometimes going up to a whole month. I have received MDMA and LSD so far from the good vendors here in SR. Currently living in South East Asia, in a country where the penalty for trafficking is death by hanging. Trafficking amounts for things like MDMA are &gt;30 grams (I checked the law). If you are still interested in ordering, do order from vendors who have a great rep for super stealth. Don&#039;t worry so much about the cost, because otherwise you&#039;d be dead. Try to keep your orders to things that are not easy to detect (not weed) and try to keep your orders small (&lt;30grams). It&#039;s a serious mindfuck whenever I get my goods (only had 3 orders total so far) but I think it&#039;s quite manageable depending on country. The postal service here isn&#039;t nearly as advanced as anywhere else in the world but I can&#039;t say for sure if the post checks mail as stringently as others. I will say however that I haven&#039;t come up with any reports on people being charged with possession/trafficking drugs IN THE MAIL... :) let me know if you&#039;re ever going to order. Maybe I&#039;ll buy some off you for a small premium :D

				Do not order to UAE. If you do and get caught you will be FUCKED 7 ways till Sunday. It is a dumb idea from start to finish.
