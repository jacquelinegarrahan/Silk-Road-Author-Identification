				Here&#039;s something I lifted from another website enjoy lol : (its got a lot of un PC race stuff, so calm down all you liberal types, its not serious)<br /><br />Ireland is a mildewy, cloud-shrouded rock inhabited by an ungovernable race of fuck-crazed, monkey-faced ginger mackerel-snappers, whose legendary capacity for alcohol and maniacal obsession with death and misery, is offset only by their incomprehensible (and likely completely fake) language. It is the paedophile capital of the world. It used to be dominated by Britfags, but at some point, the UK decided that Ireland was not cool enough for them, and kicked most of them out. The gay Irish were allowed to stay in the UK as Northern Ireland, a terrorist camp bordering the piece-of-shit country. The people of Ireland, known as Micks, Paddies, and White Niggers, are, like their African namesakes, mostly lazy, good-for-nothing parasites, interested in little except intoxication, fornication, sport, violence, sport violence, fornication violence, and mass rhythmic dancing. Their diet consists primarily of fried potatoes washed down with booze, and their day-to-day activities include drinking, fighting, laying about in their own filth, betting on football, and playing upon harps and tin whistles. The Irish are also known for their complete and utter lack of gray matter; most Polish jokes told in America are actually Irish jokes as enjoyed in the rest of the UK. As such, they are still better than the ill-tempered, parsimonious Scots, the tailless Manx, the subhuman Welsh, and of course, the snaggletoothed English. <br /><br />Erin Go Braugh motherfuckers!

				Did anyone like the article about Ireland I posted here? Did anyone even read it? No? Oh, well I think I try too hard sometimes, heh. Hell, my methods to posting are throwing up a bunch of shit, and see what sticks. I think this thread slid down.
