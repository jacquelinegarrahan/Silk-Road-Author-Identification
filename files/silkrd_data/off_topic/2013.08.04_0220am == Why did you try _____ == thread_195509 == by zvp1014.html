				Hey all! Thought this might be a fun thread for discussion. Given how we&#039;re an educated community, I presume we all have some rationalizations as for why we tried a particular substance :-)<br /><br />I&#039;ll start off-<br />Marijuana. In high school, I was a big fan of liberal news media, and given how cannabis was/is a hot button issue, I was curious. Previous to this, I was completely straight-edge and anti-drug... but the science just didn&#039;t seem to stack up that pot is harmful. I tentatively bought a dime bag and smoked it to no effect; I tried many more times and eventually got into the high of it :-) The first time I smoked it I was wearing my D.A.R.E shirt, for fucks sake!<br /><br />MDMA- my depression was spiraling to its lowest of low, so I figured I might as well try what I could before killing myself. I popped some pink partyflocks, and had one of the greatest nights of my life- I hadn&#039;t felt joy or happiness for years, yet ecsasty gave me it. The hangover the day after wasn&#039;t &#039;depressive&#039; for me- rather, it was more of a &quot;We&#039;ve been fighting a lot but now our relationship is bavk together, we&#039;re going to make it through this&quot; kind of melancholy. It didn&#039;t bother me. However, MDMA was by no means a longterm solution and I had to find something else.<br /><br />LSD- I was very scared of this given all the DEA horror stories they tell you. But after doing a lot of research I decided that I&#039;d give it a go. I was very nervous to try it, especially since I&#039;m depressed- but on that particular day, I tried to be as happy as I could before taking the LSD. It was absolutely phenomenal- perhaps even life-changing- I won&#039;t claim that it cured my depression, but it certainly helped.<br /><br />Speed- I wanted to lost some weight and figure stimulant boosted exercise + borderline anorexia might work. Bad choice, though I do love the feeling of speed until it wears off.<br /><br />Ketamine- I felt the need to &#039;graduate&#039; from LSD to I went here. I also read that it has antidepressant effects and was curious. At low doses, it&#039;s very enjoyable, but the problem is dosing changes with use and I was snorting it nearly 24/7. I&#039;m not too fond of the experience, as I generally have no clue what&#039;s going on. Also, I have yet to feel the antidepressive effects of the drug.<br /><br />And that&#039;s it for now! Please share, all!
