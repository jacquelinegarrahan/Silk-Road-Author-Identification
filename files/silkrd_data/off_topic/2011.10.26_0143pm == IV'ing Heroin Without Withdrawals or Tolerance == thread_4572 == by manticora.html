				I found SR about 2 months ago, and made my first purchase a few weeks ago. I bought a few bags of heroin, and a Oxy 30.<br /><br />I had a pretty bad heroin addiction, but i&#039;ve been clean for a year, and i have no street connections anymore, so SR is the only way for me to get dope. (which is a good thing because it keeps me from having too much lol)<br /><br />Anyway, i noticed when i shot up for the first time in a year, i didn&#039;t really get that much of a rush that i was so used to. At first i thought i just didn&#039;t do enough, but slowly (about 2 minutes) i felt it pretty good, when before it was INSTANT. Has anyone else noticed this? I have a couple idea&#039;s as to why this is the case, one is that since i only did half a bag, even with my low tolerance, it wasn&#039;t enough to give me a good rush, but enough to get me fucked up (i was pretty fucked up after 30-60 mins and was for hooouuurs). Another thing that i think might be the reason is that i have no withdrawal symptoms, and i think that a big part of the rush you feel is the dope sickness leaving your body.<br /><br />Just wondering what others have experienced. I&#039;m sure im not the only one here whose been on and off the dope wagon :P

				I&#039;m fairly ignorant of heroin, as I&#039;ve only done it perhaps a dozen times, but I noticed that when I used cold water, it often took 5-10 minutes to even feel the effects. When I used room temperature/warm water, I felt it within a couple.<br /><br />Probably just a coincidence.<br />

				well i always heat it before i suck it up, but never boil it. <br /><br />I&#039;m more talking about the instant, 5-60 seconds. I think unless you have a tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, you dont feel that first 5-60 second effect.<br /><br />I think i will snort the dope more often now instead of shooting everytime. Without that rush it just isn&#039;t worth it lol
