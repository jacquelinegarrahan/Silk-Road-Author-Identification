Good clean, 80% or better MDMA is actually relatively save within a reasonable dose. They use it medically/therapeutically for various reasons such as marriage counseling, relief from PTSD, to aide the autistic in socializing and understanding emotions. It&#039;s obviously more therapeutic than medical considering it&#039;s an Empathogen, so if you&#039;re looking for a more healing substance I&#039;d go in search of the Entheogen psychedelics known as the Tryptamines such as aMT, DMT, Ayahuasca, Mushrooms, the 4-Ho and 4-AcO&#039;s. LSD, Mescaline, and Ibogaine offer very rewarding experiences.<br />2. If you ever want an easy and safe dosage for a drug, look it up on Erowid. A good dosage for me is between 120-300mg of MDMA often combined with other psychedelics in order to &#039;flip&#039; as they call it. Obviously you&#039;d want to start at 120-200mg to grow accustomed to it and you&#039;ll be able to judge for yourself if a larger dose might just increase the negative effects rather than amplify the positive ones.<br />3. It&#039;s hard to say, I mean quality MDMA can be small crystal like powder or large chunky crystals, it can range in color from white, to tan, to dark brown, to even purple. I just trust the reviews and test it myself when I get it. Buy a marquis test online and you&#039;ll be able to tell if it&#039;s MDMA in seconds, also you should have little to no comedown and a flood of almost sedating euphoria from a clean roll. Unless it&#039;s mixed with caffeine or some other stimulant you&#039;ll almost feel sleep on clean MDMA.<br />4. Pill form is best for selling, straight crystal MDMA is best for personal use.<br />5. Symbiosis and K Queen are fantastic vendors and have quality goods, I say use them if you want MDMA or Ketamine in the UK.<br />6. Personally I wouldn&#039;t pay more than $30 a gram. Look up the synthesis online though, if you know basic chemistry and have the proper supplies, well then as long as you&#039;re safe and careful it&#039;s relatively simple to make yourself.<br />7. Yes, there is definitely tolerance. Try to separate your rolls between two weeks at the least to give your brain time to rest and restore it&#039;s energy. If you don&#039;t care to much and take enough anti-oxidants and vitamins for the trip you can generally feel very strong effects in two-three days after usage.<br />8. Drink water, take anti-oxidants, get proper sleep before and after rolling, eat fresh organic food only while rolling, socialize as much as you can, make time to be alone and explore your body and mind to music, take a day off afterwards to relax, and most importantly have fun, take the ticket, take the ride. Enjoy buddy!! ^-^
