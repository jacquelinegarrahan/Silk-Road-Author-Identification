				free methadone, and some morphine pills what more would you like ?<br /><br />Look here - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR4CMaY8Gjg - this guy has it all. just read the description.<br /><br />My god seeing this my blood boils when in normal countries you can get all that and here I pay huge money for unknown cut shitty quality heroin (which is still same or better than silkroads popular vendors).<br /><br />Also I know some people in UK who get PURE 99.8% diamorphine in ampoules as maintenence (real heroin which was sold legally in ~ 1900) and it last about ~ 4 hours. <br /><br />So what are we getting ? What pure &quot;heroin&quot; exactly is ? What the hell is in &quot;heroin&quot; ? My guess would be mostly diamorphine , some morphine , and other leftover alkaloids&nbsp; also cuts (active cuts who has access to them which strongly potentiate opiates/opiods like diphenhydramine, cyclizine and others) and inactive , in very bad cases coffeine and some other shit.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised seeing heroin thread is the biggest thread on silkroad but not one sample was sent to netherlands lab just for curiosity to see whats inside.<br /><br />Also this stuff bk- whatever - he says dosage is about 2x but its much better than diamorphine amps he&#039;s getting. Also I&#039;m surprised to see that it&#039;s black why is it so ? Seems like blacktar (well even tar gets dark brown) but it can&#039;t be dangerous otherwise they wouldn&#039;t prescribe it.<br /><br />

				I watched it - pretty boring to watch but the description was interesting.<br /><br />Not sure what country you&#039;re from. But in Harley Street in London you can get private scripts of anything you want as long as you have the money. I know they&#039;ve cracked down on it a bit recently but back in the day, there used to be queues of addicts getting their diamorphine amps and pretty much anything else you wanted.<br /><br />So corrupt so so freely available - 10 years ago I was getting boxes of amps a week and as many other pharmaceuticals as I wanted as long as I had the money, which wasn&#039;t a problem because you just go back to your hometown and sell them ready to get your next batch the following week - all ending in a free never ending supply of the highest quality drugs on the market.<br /><br />Every Dr back then was called Dr Patel (fake names, corruption at it&#039;s finest). <br /><br />Like I said it still goes on nowadays in Harley Street London but to a much lesser extent - you just need to know the contacts.<br /><br />If I remember correctly it used to be £20 for &#039;the consultation&#039; and £20 for the script. So for £40 you could walk away with hundreds of pounds worth of the finest pharmaceuticals known to man.
