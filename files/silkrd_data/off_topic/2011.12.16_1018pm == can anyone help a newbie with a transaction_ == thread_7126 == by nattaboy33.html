				i made the purchase on monday (which the seller has given me a run around and wont answer me, you know who you are). I will keep the name a secret unless my package is here by monday, then i will rant and rave... but anyways, when you finalize early, then under the transaction it says:<br />ordered: December 12, 2011, 2:31 am UTC<br />shipped: December 13, 2011, 3:26 am UTC<br /><br />where it says shipped, is that something that the seller does on his end that he &quot;shipped&quot; it? because the order was a done deal on the 12th, and about 24 hours later it says &quot;shipped&quot;. i was curious if that means he &quot;shipped&quot; it and i should be getting mail soon, of it that means that was the actual finalization of the process.

				...the seller would have to set the status ....which you see as shipped...there&#039;s also a state &#039;processing&#039; which you might have missed....if you&#039;re a newbie did you finalise early?<br />

				There are 3 steps.<br /><br />You order, your info says processing, his shows up as a new order.<br /><br />Vendor clicks on shipped, which clears out your address and stats so he can&#039;t see them anymore, and on your end it changes to &#039;shipped&#039;, and has the &#039;finalize&#039; option then available.<br /><br />If you click &#039;finalize&#039; the vendor gets his payment. Normally, you do this when you receive your item, but if you&#039;ve agreed to finalize early, the vendor most likely won&#039;t ship until you&#039;ve clicked on finalize.<br /><br />Hope that clears it up for you.<br /><br />BTW - mail takes 2-3 times as long in the 2 weeks before Christmas, so a week isn&#039;t very long to wait to start stomping your feet.

				no youre right a week isn&#039;t a long time to get pissed off about it, but over 2 days ago, asking a simple question &quot;when is it gonna be shipped?&quot; and then getting no response after his profile says last seen &quot;today&quot;, every day since then, is a pretty legitmate reason i&#039;d say, just a simple soon, or it did, or it won&#039;t is good enough for me

				Maybe he is just very busy and has a backlog of messages.<br /><br />Or maybe he responded by...marking the item shipped when he shipped it?<br /><br />To be honest, I probably wouldn&#039;t answer somebody who asked me when it was going to be shipped less than a day after they ordered.

				Hopefully you have your package by now. <br /><br />I just wanted to mention that if you ordered from one of the top vendors, someone who moves a lot of product, and you sent them a message asking when is it going to ship/arrive just hours after you placed the order and they have already flagged it as shipped, they aren&#039;t going to answer you.<br /><br />To be honest, if you keep it up, they are going to get annoyed.<br /><br />There is a certain etiquette involved here.<br /><br />During the time leading up to your actually placing your order the vendor is going to expect a few questions, do you vac seal, express shipping, that sort of thing, and they usually try to answer you as quickly as they can.<br /><br />When you actually place your order, it is assumed you have had your questions answered, and the vendor will place the order into &#039;Shipping&#039; when they in fact ship the goods, unless you have been requested to &#039;finalize early&#039;. If that is the case, you are expected to finalize the shipment (assuming you have agreed to this requirement), at which point the vendor should send you a PM when they do in fact ship the package.<br /><br />If you have finalized early, one PM to the vendor saying something like:<br /><br />&#039;Hi, because I finalized early as per your request, could you please let me know when the package does in fact ship,&nbsp; so that I can estimate when I might get the product, thank you.&#039;<br /><br />A vendor will usually respond to that type of PM.<br /><br />If you have not finalized early, then when the vendor flags the package as shipped, you should take that as the date and time the package has in fact shipped.&nbsp; At this point please do not start sending PM&#039;s to the vendor every few hours or days asking about your package.<br /><br />Wait at least long enough for the package to be considered late, 5-10 days, depending on where it is coming from.&nbsp; If you are ordering from the UK or EU, wait at least 10 days.&nbsp; Also, check the vendors profile for estimated delivery times if they are international in order to save yourself some grief.<br /><br />Think of it from the vendors side.&nbsp; He ships 50 packages over a few days.&nbsp; If every one of those buyers start PM&#039;ing them once or twice a day, thats hundreds of messages they have to weed through, taking time away from getting other buyers purchases ready and replying to other legitimate questions.<br /><br />So any time they see &#039;did my package ship&#039; or &#039;when will it arrive&#039;, they probably just skip the message.<br /><br />I have ordered from vendors all over the world, with some purchases taking 18-24 days to arrive while others have arrived in 5 days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just be patient, give it a little time and give your vendor the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Don&#039;t pester them if they have flagged it as shipped until a reasonable amount of time has passed.<br /><br />Now, if the order sits in &#039;processing&#039; and never moves to &#039;in transit&#039;, give them a couple of days.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t see it move to &#039;in transit&#039;, send them a message politely asking about it.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t hear anything and four days pass without it moving to &#039;in transit&#039;, I would cancel that order as quick as you can, even if you lose a little in the process.&nbsp; And I wouldn&#039;t be ordering from the vendor again, unless they had a REALLY good excuse.<br /><br />Well, once again I seem to have gotten carried away with my typing.&nbsp; Hopefully something I said was useful.<br /><br />As they say, &#039;Patience will be rewarded&#039; (at least I think they say that :) )

				Right click on sent messages and you can tell if he read or ignored your messages.
