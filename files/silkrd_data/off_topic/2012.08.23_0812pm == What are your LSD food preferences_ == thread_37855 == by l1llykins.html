				I know some people prefer to eat before and others prefer to have ready-to-eat foods available during the trip. So let me know, what do you like to eat before, during, and/or after dropping acid? And when do you prefer to eat?

				I become so aware on acid that I prefer to eat vegan the entire day, even if I plan to trip at night. Otherwise I will puke and go on a guilt trip. <br /><br />While I trip I only like to eat fruits, veggies, nuts juice and water. I&#039;ve also eaten hummus and bread. But yeah, I generally stay away from junk food.<br /><br />After the trip I like to eat plain foods because my taste buds are really sensitive and food tastes way too strong.<br /><br />On NBOMes I&#039;ve eaten nachos and pizza without a problem, haha.

				Yeah food is NASTY. Most of it is breathing. I have NEVER eaten anything tripping. A plate of anything is all gross looking and breathing.<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t everyone see it this way tripping? You could not pay me $1000 to eat just about anything tripping on LSD.<br /><br /><br />...but I also do not trip on LSD anymore. so.<br />

				I loooove fruit on LSD, seriously next time you trip go to the super market (or farmers market if you&#039;re fancy and want organic) and buy a bunch of fruit, all kinds.<br /><br />I remember one time I bit a strawberry and I stared at it for a good 20 minutes wondering &quot;how the hell does this come out like this?&quot; That&#039;s how you know you&#039;re tripping&nbsp; :D

				When I trip on LSD sometimes (mostly on shrooms but sometimes LSD) I trip so hard that I forget how to eat.I enjoy eating exotic fruits when I&#039;m high and/or tripping.But it seems like every time that I trip I end up tripping so hard that I just sit there with a slice of mango on the end of a fork trying to figure out how to eat it or why I would want to.Plus with LSD or shrooms and especially with stimulants my body cant eat when I do figure out what I should do with the food,it will either reject it and Ill throw it all up or Ill chew on the food to get the juices out then spit the actual chunks of food out.If any of you have done meth or adderall its like that feeling.I always get that feeling on LSD I kind of feel weakish and know that I should eat something and the food looks so good but I just cant bring myself to swallow the food and it never tastes as good as it looks.

				Shrooms and LSD are two very different animals. The only thing they have in common is the word &quot;tripping&quot;. I get the munchies as I begin to level off on shrooms.<br /><br />LSD - I guess it may have just been me. I would not come within 100 feet of food.

Like I said, I try to go vegan the day that I trip. I&#039;ll take vitamins and even go for a short run. Make sure you stay hydrated throughout the day. You should drop as soon as it feels &quot;right&quot;. A small snack 30 minutes before dropping would probably be ok. I just listen to my body and go with the flow. It took a while to get it right. I used to puke all the time.

				this sounds kind of strange but if you ever go camping and use dry ice to keep food from spoiling you can put fruits in along with your other food and the sublimation of the dry ice will carbonate the fruit. a lot of times if im camping i do psychedelics, and it can be a pretty unique experience to munch on a carbonated strawberry while tripping balls. oranges are good too :)<br /><br />i use a mesh baggie so they won&#039;t get frozen or anything and hang them near the top of the cooler or whatever

				Eat a starburst next time you&#039;re peaking on lsd and prepare to have your world rocked with juicyness. Or pineapple is really good.<br /><br />Oh and blowing bubbles? Pffft, crack a few glowsticks in your bubble juice and then blow some glow in the dark bubbles.

				I wanted to add something for people that get nausea on psychs (like me&nbsp; :&#039;( ). <br /><br />I find that ginger gum is very helpful when coming up and taking ginger caps an hour before tripping also helps take away all nausea. I&#039;m a complete freak when it comes to nausea so I even wear the acupressure wristbands to relive nausea, just google all this and you can read more about it. Pepto bismol used to be good to take during a trip but it doesn&#039;t work for me anymore, I think I&#039;m immune to it after abusing it for so many years&nbsp; :D

				Ice cream cake. <br /><br />I tripped with some friends and went to a show. Came back and felt kind of hungry so we opened the fridge to find my friend&#039;s brother&#039;s ice cream cake from 3 days before. We cut into it and it felt weird to cut into, then all the icing colors were making the trip stronger, and eating you could feel the &quot;blue&quot; of the icing and stuff. It was strange but awesome.

				This has been said before, here and elsewhere, but strawberries are the shit on Lucy. I once spent an hour eating a whole bucket of the best, most juicy, delicious strawberries I&#039;ve ever seen. A-fucking-mazing :)<br /><br />Gatorade is good as well, keeps your energy and fluids up (which may not be a big issue, but if you forget to drink water 8 hours can leave you feeling a bit crap) and I really like gum when my mouth starts to feel weird near the end.<br /><br />I don&#039;t eat before dropping, it affects the come up too much for me. Nothing worse than waiting for the effects and having them take longer than an hour because you have a full stomach. And I would never eat a proper meal during the trip, just seems to foreign...

				Interesting thread. If I eat before a strong trip, I&#039;m guaranteed to projectile vomit. For me, sugary liquids are the worst, they come right back up. Once I&#039;m peaking, I can eat anything I want. I like strong, spicy flavors when I&#039;m tripping. Fruit is great, but can be a little too sweet for me. Pepperoni pizza and a nice Belgian ale&nbsp; are a trip tradition for me, along with a blunt of good weed. <br /><br />My wife, on the other hand, is one of those people who has trouble eating on LSD from start to finish. The funny thing is, once I get some food in her, her stomach settles down for the night and she&#039;s fine. Her magic food is beef ramen. If I can convince her to eat a bowl of that, she&#039;s good to go. I wonder if other people have a &quot;magic food&quot; like that?

				Keep it natural and pure. <br /><br /><br />pears and pomegranates are my favorite - You really get a feel for the energy and substance the fruits contain. <br /><br /><br />salmon lochs and quinoa for a lite but moderate snack -&nbsp; &nbsp;My body doesn&#039;t really like the junkier food (67-85% of u.s food market ?). I feel dull and sense a shift to a lower vibrational energy - I could be imagining this to a degree but this is how it is now for me.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

				A lot of foods that I normally like taste like garbage to me on LSD. I only seem to enjoy eating raw fruits and vegetables.

				I figured I would be drilled on the scientifics of that.&nbsp; I am aware of the rumor aspect, however upon my own trail &amp; error with same dosage, the VitC trips lasted way longer and smoother.. especially if you drink it as you&#039;re coming down.&nbsp; It could easily just be the nutrient / vitamins making your body feel much better, especially during an intense LSD period of not eating.&nbsp; 8)

				So far I haven&#039;t eaten on any of my trips, but on my last trip I walked into the room where my girlfriend was watching TV and she was watching bizarre foods or a commercial for the show acme on or something and I almost threw up watching him eat some crazy shit. I couldn&#039;t even look towards the TV without gagging. She had to change the channel just so I could sit and talk to her.
