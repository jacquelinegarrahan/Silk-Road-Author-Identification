				I masturbate vigorously!&nbsp; ;D ...actually I don&#039;t work, I just do stuff (non sexual... honest!) for money when I need to... that way I deprive the government of tax, that makes me feel good.<br /><br />In my old job I used to spend about 7 hours a day on the internet and the remaining 1 hour of my shift covering up for the fact that I had just spent 7 hours on the internet. In my second ever job I used to do about 70 minutes work in a 6 hour shift and snort cocaine with the security guards for the rest of the time, I often did free overtime, sniff sniff&nbsp; ;D

				Whenever I get a package of jelly beans, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold jelly bean duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the &quot;loser,&quot; and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red jelly beans are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue jelly beans as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.<br /><br />Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.<br /><br />When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one jelly bean, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to:<br /><br />The Jelly Bean Company, A Division of Mars, Inc. Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A.<br /><br />along with a 3x5 card reading, &quot;Please use this jelly bean for breeding purposes.&quot;<br /><br />This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of jelly beans.

				I sell drugs. When shrooms can fetch $1000/ounce where I live, it weeds out the kids and leaves just the serious people.<br /><br />I should probably get a real job so I can justify my income to the IRS. I&#039;m sure they wonder how I pay my bills when I have no job.

To this end, I hold jelly bean duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the &quot;loser,&quot; and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red jelly beans are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue jelly beans as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.<br /><br />Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment.<br /><br />When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one jelly bean, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to:<br /><br />The Jelly Bean Company, A Division of Mars, Inc. Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A.<br /><br />along with a 3x5 card reading, &quot;Please use this jelly bean for breeding purposes.&quot;<br /><br />This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of jelly beans. I consider this &quot;grant money&quot;. I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re my hero.<br /><br />sdesu
