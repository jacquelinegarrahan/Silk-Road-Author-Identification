				on xmas eve i did some good coke from the road and ended up out-ting myself to my friend of 20 years over the phone abut my sexuality, tattoos, sexual history with men, and especially transgenderism.<br /><br />he was supportive and all but coke was 100% the reason i did this and not even mdma produced such an intense confidence, willingness and eagerness to ring him up after months of no contact and blurt it out on the phone.. the stuff is like a truth serum!<br /><br />scary time but what the hell&nbsp; ill move on from this and its probobly a good thing but as the sober days continue i do wish i hadnt told him and reinstated the friendship.. gotta put up some serious boundaries with my responses to his now plethora of questions now..

I just moved him away from my crotch and said I wasn&#039;t really into oral sex and that I was tired so would he mind if I went to sleep? He said sure sweetheart and I was, uh-oh, I should really try to leave or something in the morning because there was a slight lost in translation thing (long story. Long, uncomfortable story). <br /><br />I still don&#039;t think that makes me bi because it was sort of an accident, I didn&#039;t intend to be in that situation, it just kind of evolved and it&#039;s a very long story. <br /><br />The other time, we ran out of room to sleep and I couldn&#039;t be bothered walking home (15-20 minute walk and I was dead tired from partying). But then he kicked me out lol. So I just went to the living room, and then virtually got kicked out of there as well as my flat mate decided he didn&#039;t want to face his wife in the morning. <br /><br />Basically though, if given a choice, I prefer women. Just seems to work out better.

				I don&#039;t see the point of this thread.<br /><br />We&#039;re all here because we&#039;re like minded. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re gay/bi/tgwhatever, if you&#039;ve got a good product or money to spend, you&#039;re a part of the community.<br /><br />Fashion it like the Hacker Community; if you have knowledge and/or are eager to learn something, you&#039;re accepted regardless of orientation, race, religion, or any other prejudicial column.<br /><br />Threads like this lead to contempt among members.

She did go through a lesbian phase but then she got married and had a kid and then got divorced. Haven&#039;t talked to her in a few years. Wasn&#039;t really a close friend, but when you go out and do coke, you tend to hang out with a certain crowd that you wouldn&#039;t hang out with normally. Like, the only reason you hang out is because everyone does coke. Yeah, that&#039;s why we hung out, but that&#039;s what made her confession more bold, we weren&#039;t best friends or anything.

I hate that shit, and hate the scum who do that to women because a) no one will have sex with them and b) they&#039;re too weak to fight men so they target women instead. I just saw a rather sick clip today that I didn&#039;t intend to as I did not realise the content until I&#039;d seen half of it (you could hear her bleeding internally as the blood was splashing around inside her). All I could think of doing was finding this sick turd and ramming my dick up his ass again and again and again and again again and again and again and again, then sexually mutilating him, and then setting him on fire. The stupid idiot even showed his face clearly throughout the whole4 or 5 minutes. Shouldn&#039;t be too hard to find if you were a cop.I seriously though about becoming LE today because I thought maybe I would have a chance to stop some of it. I&#039;m conflicted. I don&#039;t know what I should do about it.<br /><br />I&#039;ve already talked a bit about this topic in a previous post, but that thread was deleted over Christmas by either a mod or the OP. (Still have the post but I don&#039;t see the point in repasting it.Everyone on the thread seemed to get the message.)<br /><br />Hope your friend is now doing okay. I also hope this bastard got caught, but I&#039;m assuming that&#039;s sadly not the case.

I was looking at sex videos on the internet earlier today through curiosity (I was not even horny, I just appreciate beauty) and the clip had a nondescript title like &quot;pretty brunette&quot; or something in a nondescript section like &quot;babes&quot; or something. The previous clip was fairly tame. I clicked on it thinking it would be okay, but it wasn&#039;t. Although I think that this is a really, really, really bad idea and should be illegal because it can promote it, some clips depict rough sex and even pretend rape. It can sometimes be hard to judge rape from pretend rape because some models agree to these clips. (If it had mentioned what it was in the title I would not have clicked on it.) <br /><br />Because of this it took me about 2 minutes to realise she wasn&#039;t acting and that the shithead was getting rougher and rougher. Then I heard the blood, saw the body language that I have observed before (if you&#039;ve been in a situation like that you know it instantly) saw the subtle physiological indicators on her body, and knew it immediately. I couldn&#039;t think of anything else but finding this piece of shit. <br /><br />I saved the page so I can find it again. I still don&#039;t know what to do. I&#039;m tempted to tell the police but I don&#039;t know what country he is in (probably U.S. from accent) and if it would make a difference.

They make ALL of us look bad and we ALL have to pay a little each time it happens as society starts to shut down males. Again, I don&#039;t advocate vigilantism (FYI, that&#039;s how the Cosa Nostra began. They guarded people&#039;s houses during an epidemic of violence and house lootings. They charged a price and protected someone&#039;s property and to get their name out there, they were particularly vindictive to anyone foolish enough to attack an owner/propert under their protection. They soon became feared. They expanded into other areas and changed their name to mafiosa (mafia) to further protect their identity and the rest is how they say history. I&#039;m going on old information here but this is pretty much the bones of it to my memory.); sometimes you are in the right place at the right time and it almost seems as if it&#039;s calling out for you to set it straight.

				im bi. i dont think its anything to be bashful about and anyone thats against homosexuality is close minded/raised on religious views that they dont know the origin of. if you cant understand why someone would be gay or bi, i feel sorry for you. there are obviously attractive sides to both men and women, or they wouldnt fuck eachother -__-. not to supply too much info but im not really attracted to the entire male organism, nor could i picture myself in a relationship with one, but there is nothing wrong with submitting/breaking down your ego and accepting sexual connection no matter the form. its always nice to connect to another human being.<br /><br />women make me want to just wrap my arms around them and keep them safe. like im there big strong man that will always protect them(cheezy but true). with men its the other way around. i submit and embrace my weakness to them.(im sure this is freaking the homophobes way the fuck out!)<br /><br />i think a more interesting question would be to ask sexual preference and drug of choice to see if people have grown to accept aspects of their sexuality that they wouldnt have other wise, because of the substances they use. (i cant lie, ive had psychedelic experiences in which i have experienced very homosexual thoughts that are normally unnatural to me, but it didnt bother me. you should always embrace your desires and keep an open mind IMO.)

I think this is not true.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is where we&#039;re going to have one of those nice little chats like I did last time before you pulled the thread. You&#039;re right of course. Rape pornography does not cause someone to desire to rape, in the same way that someone firing a 12-gauge point blank at someone does not cause them to die, rather it is the shell and the fact they were standing in the way. I think this is a really weak argument here as wanting to watch girls brutally raped, beaten up and psychologically traumatised for the rest of their lives evidence of somebody&#039;s intention of acting when this dumb fuck actually gets with a girl. Look, I have posted so much on rape (including the posts you deleted) I feel you have no right to come back on these forums and justify it.<br /><br />If this is the kind of thing that turns you on, I trust you won&#039;t have any objection if I did the same to you? Yeaaaah, see, that&#039;s what I thought. I don&#039;t know whether you are sick and need help because you honestly believe it&#039;s great to see someone suffer, or&nbsp; whether you are sick and need help because you actually know it is wrong, but are trying to change a correct attitude about something to a wrong attitude by phrasing it in such a way that you believed will open up debate about it. No one here cares how you phrase it. Rape is wrong, is wrong, is wrong. Which you must actually know deep down as if I came over to your house with some deadbeat guys and tied you up and gave you the option to say no, you absolutely would. I don&#039;t see many rapists putting up their hand to be raped in return.<br /><br />Look. Fuck off. I&#039;m tired of dealing with you. You don&#039;t watch rape unless you want to do that yourself. Obviously, if you are watching it, you like the idea of it because you are a dumb fuck and fantasise about doing it to others.&nbsp; Obviously, if you are&nbsp; because you are a dumb fuck and fantasising about doing it to others you are much more likely to do it. <br /><br />I was wrong about you. I thought we had cleared this up. EVERYBODY, E V E R Y B O D Y, tried to tell you. They wasted their time. And if someone like TreeSpirit couldn&#039;t get through to you, you have no hope. So....... because you deleted my posts but still haven&#039;t got the message, I see you are in need of more reinforcement. <br /><br />The following is for serialfapper and does not concern anyone else, hence, can be skipped entirely if you are not him or some other sick phuc. (God. No wonder you &quot;have never had a girl&quot;. You don&#039;t deserve one you piece of shit, but what you DO deserve is to have the shit raped out of you.)<br /><br />Why it&#039;s probably a bad idea to rape (you fucking idiot)<br /><br />[Edit. Primarily addressed to OP. If you are not, you need not read the following.]<br /><br />If the OP is reading this, I notice you have not posted beyond 1 after this thread, and not used your account. I figured you read the replies, felt unpopular, and decided to kre-8 a new username. And that you wish you hadn’t added that thing at the end.<br /><br />If this is the case and you are following this thread in cognito, you should probably take it as a good thing that so many have replied with their advice because now you have a chance to contemplate this before actually doing something similar. A bruise to the ego now is better than looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life, trust me.<br /><br />One of the most horrific sexual assaults happened after a young woman was mugged at an ATM in Geelong. After robbing about $150 from her, he brutally raped her, the details of which I will preclude from this post for obvious reasons. She was taken to hospital unrecognisable as she was covered from head to toe in her own blood. Hospital staff said that if she hadn’t gotten to hospital the moment she had she would have bled out (died from her wounds). She can never have children, and needs to feed with a colostomy bag/catheter (her bowels were prolapsed).<br /><br />The piece of unmitigated faeces that did this shaved his head and burnt his own fingerprints off in an effort to avoid being found. If memory serves correct, he was also wearing a hoodie at the time of the attack which hid his head, but let me reacquaint with the facts to confirm. They eventually caught him within a year. The turd is currently serving time in prison, no doubt under hostile conditions (rape included) and will not be released any time soon.<br /><br />More recently, Jill Meagher, raped and murdered in September, was last observed by a very badly positioned camera inside a shop that didn’t even capture her or her attacker’s face fully (additionally, he was wearing a hoodie) as there was a bar on the shop door that got in the way. Despite this very limited clue, Victoria Police were able to find the attacker within a week, despite the fact he had driven her body well away from the crime scene (they found the buried body first). I am cheerful to say, he will stand trial in January 2013. And that cabbie that saw a young woman passed out from drinking on the street and who decided to opportunistically rape her while not even conscious? Despite the fact she did not see his face, I am cheerful to say he has been caught, charged, and also awaiting sentencing.<br /><br />I could cite a third example where police caught someone for a depraved sexual assault after the case had gone cold (perp now in prison ;) ), and where they had to take away a whole section of the wall – at considerable difficulty – for analyses, but I think you get the message. Rest assured, police are literally able to move mountains when they want to. If you rape somebody, and are found (and let me assure you, gambling on 5-0 not finding you is something you don’t want to do), you will most likely face prison time. If that happens, a bare 1 year behind bars is sometimes more than enough time to be considerably abused mentally, physically and sexually. There is no justice in prison, and even if you do find the courage to speak up and risk even greater violence, wardens will either not believe you or not even care. And regardless of how tough you are, there are always at least 100 bigger, tougher, meaner, more evil guys than you. Trying to match wits with police by raping someone but being very careful not to be found out is……………… sheer stupidity. <br /><br />Take this as a warning. It is a good thing that you added what you did because if you had kept it to yourself and went ahead and did it, and got caught, which you will, and go to prison, which you will, as a 17 year old in prison you will be absolutely fucked without mercy for the first whole week, as everyone wants to be first on account of new prisoners having a tighter sphincter because it is as yet unprolapsed, and without a doubt essentially destroyed in every way you can imagine. By the time you get out you will be incapable of living life normally for the rest of your life.<br /><br />I don’t know the methods police use to find people. What I do know is that, when they really want to find someone, they always do.<br /><br />Don’t be mad at everyone here who gave you hard-to-take advice. In reality, you should be thanking us.<br /><br />Now that you’ve got the message, I guess my work here is done. I assume I can let this topic go? This thread could probably be justifiably locked at some point, as it’s served its purpose.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty. <br /><br />[I have kept explicit details from this post as the full details would probably make some a little queasy, which is to be expected. They are available upon further research. Do not ask me where on the internet or in the media to find it. Some information is best kept off the forums as some sick phucs out there could try to imitate these people. Then again, there is specific information that could benefit SR users, like ML and drug-ferrying techniques, that should probably STILL be kept off the forums as vendors and buyers are not the only ones viewing SR material. Consider giving this kind of detailed information over PM to trusted members, or encrypting it before posting it one the forums. If LE want to read it, they need the key. If keys are given out individually, this should fix the problem.]<br /><br />btw, why were 5 of my posts deleted over Christmas???? <br /><br />OP referred to is you btw. Since you deleted my post when you found criticism too hard to take, I can&#039;t refer to it. But you&#039;re obviously very, very slow with understanding.<br /><br />And don&#039;t hijack this thread and turn it into a rape vs normal contest. Just cross-reference search rape + me and I&#039;m sure my posts will guide you. Or maybe not. I don&#039;t want to talk about this sad issue anymore. Get the message. Watching rape is not okay. Do some research. According to police a civilian is more likely to rape based on the fact that they regularly watch this material. <br /><br />Just do us all a favour and piss off. You&#039;re a kid (17). You&#039;re one year from being an adult. Also one year from being TRIED as an adult. If you go to prison at your age, it&#039;s over for you. And don&#039;t think you won&#039;t get caught if you do some research.<br /><br />Can we all go back to the original question? This thread was supposed to be about whether you were straight, gay or bi. And maybe why, if you&#039;re up to talking about it.

				Not that I want to take this thread further off topic than it already is starting to go, but I feel as if I should weigh in my opinion regarding the last two posts. First of all, I do not think that rape pornography causes people to desire to rape. People who are not sexually aroused by the thought of rape are going to find rape pornography extremely disgusting, people who are aroused by the thought of rape are going to find rape pornography arousing. My opinions on rape pornography are pretty much the same as they are on child pornography, both are sought out because of an already existing desire and neither cause new desires. In the case of child pornography, numerous studies have shown that its availability negatively correlates with the prevalence of child molestation. Other studies show that the availability of abusive pornography has a negative correlative relationship with sexual abuse. I do not at all think it is an honest analogy to compare rape pornography : rape with firing a shotgun at someone point blank : murder. Firing a shotgun at someone point blank has a clear causative link to murder, there is a negative correlative relationship between the availability of rape pornography and sexual assault.&nbsp; <br /><br />Second I agree that there is a clear distinction between fantasy and reality. Studies have shown that &gt; 1/3rd of males have fantasized about raping someone and additionally the fantasy of being raped is quite common for females. If your claim that fantasy is evidence of intention was true it would mean that a large percentage of females have the desire to be forced to engage in sexual intercourse without their consent and against their will. Just food for thought. There is also ample evidence that a desire to rape has been genetically encoded into large percentages of males, even more than 1/3rd. It is called the evolutionary theory for rape and I believe it is the theory that makes by far the most sense, although it is quite controversial due to its implications. Essentially, for most of human existence rapists were very difficult to catch, and mothers life preserving abortions and contraceptives were unheard of. This meant that rapists produced far more offspring than non-rapists. The implication of this is that if there is any genetic component that predisposes someone to desire rape, it is going to be a very common gene. Of course, as the proponents of the evolutionary theory of rape (ie: scientists) are quick to point out, this does not excuse rape at all. Humans are intelligent and self controlling beings, not slaves to their primal desires.&nbsp; <br /><br />Third of all, you act as if someones viewing of images is equal to perpetrating the acts they see in those images. This is extremely nonsensical. The poster you reply to has said that he does not think images of rape should be illegal, not that he thinks it should be legal for him to rape whoever he wants. Additionally you claim that you don&#039;t watch rape unless you want to do that yourself, however a substantial percentage of the market for rape fantasy pornography consists of females, whom as I already mentioned quite commonly fantasize about being raped. I do agree though that a person who fantasizes about rape is statistically much more likely to rape someone than a person who does not have such fantasies, after all a great many rapists fantasize about rape prior to actually raping anyone. However taking this claim at face value is misleading yourself, someone who has been sexually abused is statistically far more likely to sexually abuse another person than someone who has not been sexually abused is, however only a minority of those who have been sexually abused go on to sexually abuse others. <br /><br />I agree with you entirely that it is absolutely not okay for anyone to force another person to have sex with them against their will. However I see that you are blurring two entirely different issues together into one issue: rape fantasy and actual rape. This is most likely some emotional response and it is not doing you any good actually. I see that people do the same exact thing when it comes to child pornography actually, they equate child pornography possession as being the same thing as child molestation for some reason. To a rational mind there is a clear difference between these things though.&nbsp;

Most non-child rape pornography is fantasy, most child pornography is actually documented child abuse. However, I believe that no information should be outlawed and that includes real rape pornography as well as child pornography. The dangers of legalization of possession of these forms of pornography are vastly exaggerated, the actual evidence shows that criminalization of possession of these forms of pornography is more damaging to society than their legalization would be, and indeed that the criminalization of these sorts of pornography is counterproductive to the stated goals of those who are in favor of their criminalization.

				okay last post on this subject from me (maybe) as it is off topic in this thread. But I like to post citations to prove that I am right:<br /><br />Rape is the third most popular female fantasy: www.care2.com/causes/rape-ranked-as-third-most-popular-sexual-fantasy-for-women.html<br /><br />up to 40% of females have rape fantasies: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201012/the-rape-fantasy<br /><br />the evolutionary theory of rape: (is included in this .PDF , along with other popular theories, such as the feminist theory that males are part of a global conspiracy to keep them down : www.pandys.org/theoriescoercion.pdf) <br /><br />violent movies have negative correlative relationship with violence and pornography has negative correlative relationship with rape: http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/2006/10/how_the_web_prevents_rape.html<br /><br />pornography has a negative correlative relationship with rape (according to one article cited here, another claims the opposite): http://calcasa.org/prevention/what-is-the-influence-of-pornography-on-rape/<br /><br />pornography consumption versus rape rates graphic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Zillmann_Fig_5.png<br /><br />from wikipedia, it mentions the citation at first:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">McKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is &quot;specialized rapists&quot; who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switches between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is psychopathic rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to sperm competition when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one-third of males &quot;admit they would rape under specific conditions&quot; and that other surveys find that many men state having coercive sexual fantasies.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Half of it is wrong, contradicting and soo many other things, That whole book has soo many Pagan rituals in ir irs rediculas, But yet now in america they bash gays? But in the bible, when it was easter time that was when the men and women would paint their face and do sexual acts to men and women, I may post a bunch of jokey shit on the other threads, but im a very intelligent deep person, I have studied&nbsp; Symbolism, ancient geometry all religions and many other things, so im not just shooint words out my mouth that sound good.. I come from a family of Freemasons, My grandfather is a 32degree Scottish rite so i know plenty of things not your every tom dick and harry dont know..I DO NOT MEAN IM SMARTER THAN ANY 1 CAUSE I AM NOT! but iv studied religions,symbloism and many other thangs for a very long time and once on the oath iv shosen to travel your eyes open up and u see things a fully different way..Some of this may be over your heads, but i know many of you on here a re very very smart and i wish we could some times get together catch a buzz and just buikd on one another and enlighten each other..

				I&#039;m disappointed that someone can cite the amount of evidence (cite not quote) and still reach those conclusions, kmfkewm, even when beautifully constructed as above. I would love to know where this information is sourced from. Additionally, perhaps we should distinguish rape from force. Also, it seems that there&#039;s a slight interpretation issue of a couple points in my post as well. Finally, I&#039;m not the type of person who will suffer themselves to be called &#039;confused&#039; so let&#039;s clear a few things ^.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96300.msg700439#msg700439">Quote from: kmfkewm on January 03, 2013, 04:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The poster you reply to has said that he does not think images of rape should be illegal, not that he thinks it should be legal for him to rape whoever he wants.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope.

I inferred that firing a 12-gauge point blank at someone DOES cause them to die, and that arguing over the semantics of whether the pinpoint cause of death resulted from the finger pulling the trigger, or the spread velocity of over 1500 fps of shrapnel into someone&#039;s brain, was tantamount to the triviality of feeling the need to distinguish a moral line between rape and fantasy rape.<br /><br />I don&#039;t FULLY agree with the statements......<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96300.msg700439#msg700439">Quote from: kmfkewm on January 03, 2013, 04:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">First of all, I do not think that rape pornography causes people to desire to rape.

My opinions on rape pornography are pretty much the same as they are on child pornography, both are sought out because of an already existing desire and neither cause new desires. In the case of child pornography, numerous studies have shown that its availability negatively correlates with the prevalence of child molestation.

In light of the fact case studies have shown the exact opposite. <br /><br />You mentioned the notion that it is common for women to fantasise about being raped. Can&#039;t fault you on your information gathering on this point as it is very common, however I CAN fault you on your working definition of rape, which seems to mirror the common definition that some women hold. Seems a lot of women are confusing &#039;rape&#039; with &#039;force&#039;, or rough sex, two very, very different things. I can wager my bottom dollar I could show a woman what rape REALLY means and ask her whether that is what she fantasised about and the answer would be &quot;fuck no.&quot; I&#039;m staggered no one seems to know the vast difference of these terms. I&#039;ve fantasied about being aggressive. But I&#039;ve never fantasied about beating her black and blue and rupturing her insides. If your &#039;fantasy&#039; about rape doesn&#039;t include these kinds of elements, you&#039;re not doing it right. It would be classed as rough or assertive. In the first link you provided this is expounded on. So, your &quot;food for thought&quot; HAS been thought of but politely rejected on these grounds.<br /><br />I&#039;m moderately familiar with the gene theory, but you have discounted that with the scientists&#039; logic so I&#039;ll move on.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96300.msg700439#msg700439">Quote from: kmfkewm on January 03, 2013, 04:08 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Third of all, you act as if someones viewing of images is equal to perpetrating the acts they see in those images.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope.

				I believe I can very quickly, logically and concisely reduce to absurdity your argument that fantasy and reality have an intrinsic link. I don&#039;t even need to show you the statistics on coercive pornography consumption and its relationship to coercive sexual activity , although I could do that as well. <br /><br />A. A large percentage of females fantasize about being raped, a decent percentage of them frequently fantasize about this<br /><br />https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085605<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This study evaluated the rape fantasies of female undergraduates (N = 355) using a fantasy checklist that reflected the legal definition of rape and a sexual fantasy log that included systematic prompts and self-ratings. Results indicated that 62% of women have had a rape fantasy, which is somewhat higher than previous estimates. For women who have had rape fantasies, the median frequency of these fantasies was about 4 times per year, with 14% of participants reporting that they had rape fantasies at least once a week. In contrast to previous research, which suggested that rape fantasies were either entirely aversive or entirely erotic, rape fantasies were found to exist on an erotic-aversive continuum, with 9% completely aversive, 45% completely erotic, and 46% both erotic and aversive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />B. Contrary to your claim, many females are not fantasizing about consensual rough sex, in fact they are fantasizing about being forced against their will to engage in sexual acts<br /><br />http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-196534089/the-nature-of-women-s-rape-fantasies-an-analysis<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Kanin (1982) reported the only systematic empirical observations of rape fantasy content. He asked women to describe their rape fantasies and classify them as either sexual, fearful, or a combination of both. Kanin&#039;s results indicated that 50% of the women who had rape fantasies reported that these fantasies were completely fearful, 29% reported they were completely sexual, and 21% reported that they were a combination of fearful and sexual </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />After reinterpreting participants&#039; self-descriptions, Kanin (1982) concluded that women&#039;s rape fantasies fall into two discrete categories: sexual and fearful. In sexual fantasies, a woman is aggressively approached by an attractive man, who is typically a friend or lover. She gives only token verbal resistance, if any, to a desired sexual encounter. Kanin described these as highly charged, aggressive seductions. Thus, Kanin suggested that women&#039;s self-identified rape fantasies that involved sexual arousal should be thought of more as aggressive seductions rather than as rapes. In fearful fantasies, the man is likely to be older, less attractive, and a stranger; and the woman is more likely to see herself as an innocent victim. These fantasies contain coercive and painful violence and no sexual arousal. Kanin did find systematic differences between fearful and sexual fantasies, but there was also considerable overlap with regard to the man&#039;s status as a friend or stranger, male age, male attractiveness, and perceived female innocence. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />extrapolating from these two studies, it seems fair to estimate that approximately 48% of females fantasize about being &#039;coerced and violently raped&#039;. <br /><br />C. As it is inherently contradictory to wish for something to actually happen to yourself that you do not wish to happen, it is impossible. As I have established that almost half of females fantasize about being violently forced to engage in sex against their will, it therefor follows that a persons fantasies are not intrinsically linked to a persons desires in reality. <br /><br />In other words, no matter how frequently a female fantasizes about being forced to engage in sex against her will, it is impossible for this fantasy to cause her to have a desire to be forced to engage in sex against her will, as such a desire is contradictory to the very goal of being forced without consent. It is therefor impossible for a female to condition herself with rape fantasy in such a way that the fantasy bleeds over to her desires in reality. I believe that although the case can not be made as strongly for males who fantasize about raping (ie: I can not show that it is literally impossible for there to be a link between fantasy and actions in reality), that the general theme of fantasy and reality being different things will hold.
