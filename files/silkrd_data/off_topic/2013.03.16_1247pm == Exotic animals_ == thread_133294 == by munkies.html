				If you could find rare and exotic animals on the Road to buy as pets, would you get any? What would it be? I&#039;d personally get a lion, much better than a guard dog.

				I hope this never happens cause people would not treat them as required, and the sellers least of all probably; all they&#039;d think about is profit.<br /><br />Animals including exotic species must be protected and defended. We already have more than enough people who own (?) too many animals they don&#039;t know a thing about, and don&#039;t know how to care for. Leave animals in the wild where they belong, man.<br /><br />goblin

				This was a purely hypothetical scenario I made for fun. Of course it would not be ok to mail order exotic animals on the internet and I doubt there would be a large market for them anyway.<br />It would be pretty revolting and scary to see vendor descriptions like &quot;max 50% refund if baby kangaroo arrives dead&quot;

				Fuck buying rare animals. I want a crazy person as a pet. Like someone who is committed to a mental asylum for life because they think they are a duck. Just think of the hilarious shock effect.<br /><br />I bring a girl over and my pet just jumps on her and starts pecking and quacking.<br /><br />I would pay top dollar, but I need a sample first.<br />Message me
