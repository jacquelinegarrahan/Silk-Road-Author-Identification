				I was asked to post this:<br />From: greenco<br />Subject: Weekend Off<br /><br />Hello<br />It is Friday and Silk Road is still not back up. It has been a long week and we still have a lot to do but can not do anything more until Silk Road comes back up. We have decided to take a break for the weekend. We will be back Monday morning. If Silk comes back up over the weekend please spread the word that we are not gone, just out of the office for the weekend. We will arrive refreshed ready to deal with anything Monday morning<br /><br />Thanks<br />-GreenCo

				When the site came back up I was like &quot;maybe I should post that&quot; but decided against it as the new features still had me paranoid and I was about to collapse from sleep deprivation.<br /><br />Thanks for posting.

				Thanks DigitalAlch,<br />We sent that message out to about 30 people and are really glad it got out to everyone. We are back and playing catch up.<br /><br />Due to the 4 Silk Road outages over this last week all GreenCo orders made during that time will be late. This includes orders marked shipment confirmed. Our orders usually arrive within 3 to 4 days. Orders placed this last week will take between 5 and 10 days. We know this is inconvenient but it is beyond our control.&nbsp; We will keep everyone updated. <br /><br />Check out our user page and FAQ for updates and more information.<br />GreenCo<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/1647
