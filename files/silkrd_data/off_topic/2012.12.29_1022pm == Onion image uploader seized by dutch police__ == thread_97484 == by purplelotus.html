				Is it just me or was the onion image uploader just seized by Dutch police if you try to view it? Not recommending anyone actually try right now, but if anyone else already has and noticed this...

				Somebody is going to get in trouble. Odds are somebody out there didn&#039;t scrub their metadata, and I don&#039;t even want to think about the CP. I guess that is their main goal is the CP if that&#039;s in the statement?<br /><br />And what is the URL for the site again?

I noticed that a bunch of pics were from the Dutch police so I filtered out those 2 images (by file size) and was left with about 40,000 image links to delete. Those Dutch police images were from around 2011 so I guess it was raided by them then. The images need to be deleted 1 by 1 with a GET so I also left the thumbnails folder since it&#039;s huge. I then deleted php files to render the site useless. Sorry for the trouble I caused you guys, but their TOS allowed CP.

				Police forces do not hack sites and leave creepy messages like that.<br /><br />Think logically, do the police really want you to know that they&#039;ve hacked the site and now have access to all users.<br /><br />No! Why the fuck would they want the people they are about to go after to know that they are coming for them?<br /><br />Why would they give you warning, enough time to burn your computer so that they can&#039;t do you for jack shit.<br /><br />I know we all like to take drugs around here but that is no excuse to stop using your brain for the people that believe this.

				<br /><br />You are not anonymous...lol!<br />We know who you are...lol!<br /><br />Typical a &quot;&quot;police&quot;&quot; lie!<br /><br />First time ever, I see the Dutch police do something good.<br />At first the Dutch law did not alowe the Dutch police to hack.<br />Only the secret service did those things.<br /><br />I know that they were busy to change that law.<br />The Dutch government has agreed so it seems.<br /><br /><br />
