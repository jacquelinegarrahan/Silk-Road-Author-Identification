				If you do this you&#039;re a sick fuck, why the fuck should a bear die just so you can sell their body parts to some backward-as-fuck-cunts that think that it&#039;ll make them feel better and cleans their spirits/chi or whatever? <br /><br />I tell you what, how about this? We let you run around in the wild, shoot you and then cut you up and sell you. Maybe we could even send some of your teeth to your parents so they could string them together and where them to the funeral for the bits of you that were too shit to be sold or even better, we could just ship you off to Ethiopia so the starving kids could put on a few pounds. <br /><br />Either suits me, one less prick killing innocent creatures in the world sounds cushty in my book.

				UM... First off.. It isn&#039;t like i&#039;m poaching bear... Where i&#039;m from, there is a season specifically designed to shoot bear. Many people, including myself, hunt these for food. So if i&#039;m going to be killing these already, why waste the gall bladder which I don&#039;t eat. Do you not eat sausage and ham? I just saw your picture of a big english breakfast! So please quit being rude and unless you have something to contribute, please stay off my thread. Peace Mate!

				I do eat bear thank you very much... I make bear jerky... bear stew... hell I&#039;ve even fried it. As far as selling it on silk road, pretty sure I didn&#039;t say anything about it... I actually asked where there would be market.

				Actually Lim, Bear can be pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s quite a few areas in the states where they&#039;re being overrun with blackbears so it&#039;s not like people are hunting endangered shit.&nbsp; Bear chilli with some Naga Bhut Jalokia peppers thrown in can be tasty.&nbsp; I&#039;ll do bear and venison but I hate pig.&nbsp; Nasty creatures.

				We have a bear problem in our area and are actually encouraged (by forestry and police autorities) to shoot&nbsp; and eliminate as many of them as we can cuz they&#039;re starting to overpopulate and definitely causing troubles.&nbsp; Sounds sad I know, but they&#039;re suffering more by overpopulating, and of course causing trouble to us humans.<br /><br />I definitely don&#039;t advocate this sale of animal body parts thing, seems pretty whacked to me.&nbsp; I&#039;ll stick to the chemicals that make me happy :)

				Hey, at least the bear dies and doesn&#039;t live with exposed organs so they can extract gall bladder fluid whilst the bear suffers motionless, for years and years.<br />With a tube poking into their intestines whilst they&#039;re alive, which can be extremely painful and uncomfortable.<br />Those poor fucking bears :(<br />But I know, that everything is happening for a reason (I think...maybe)

				Lets not be an emotive hypocrite here, if you object to people hunting bear for food, stop eating all meat, bears are cuter than cows so they have more right to life lol??! <br />Unless the animal is endangered all &quot;meat&quot; is equal in its right to live. I hunt alot of my meat also, i feel alot less guilty eating it than some poor cow or chicken that had a horrible life pumped full of growth hormones, pressure fed etc to just become revenue for someone.

				@rise_against &amp; Lim,<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t seen it already you should check out the documentary &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; about a former actor who apparently had an epiphany and thought he could become best friends with the Grizzly bear.&nbsp; He went out and lived with the brown bears and it was going great right up until the dude and his girlfriend were eaten.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe our Gall Bladders are aphrodisiacs to bears?
