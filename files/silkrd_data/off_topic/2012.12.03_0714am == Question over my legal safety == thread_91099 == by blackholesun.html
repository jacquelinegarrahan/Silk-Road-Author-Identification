				Long story short a deal went wrong and a friend is out 14000$ because my normal real life connection went south during this deal. Money belongs to two guys who will happily kill him if they don&#039;t get what is theirs. <br /><br />Friend would like to go to the police and turn himself in and said he will be handing over all our conversations so I go down with him. We live in two separate states. I didn&#039;t make a penny off this deal I was just helping him meet a connect. He bought me dinner actually once the money was handed over. <br /><br />So legal stand point here how fucked am I once he hands over text and phone call logs? What kind of protection do I have, should I lawyer up now?

				You ask him to include you in going forward. That&#039;s the best way to unfuck yourself. But it will also tie you in relation to him, as far as the guys who will kill him might be concerned. That&#039;s a risk I think is possible.

				+1 what guru said. The $$$ amount is small enough where it&#039;s much more beneficial to you to just take the loss and give them the $$$ then the alternatives.
