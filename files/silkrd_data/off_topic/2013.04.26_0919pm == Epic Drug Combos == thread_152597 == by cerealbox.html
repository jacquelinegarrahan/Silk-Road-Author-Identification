				I have had wonderful experiences combining MDMA/MDA. Dosage is usually around 125/60. I find that it really extends the roll and gives it extra energy as well as face melting euphoria. Keep in mind that I have a lot of experience with these drugs, those dosages may make some people sick.

				This is just about the only area where I&#039;m a conservative. I think that combining drugs is a terrible idea. Second worst is following one drug closely with another, especially if they&#039;re not related chemically.<br /><br />I mean, take care of your brain, you&#039;ve only got one of&#039;em. One drug is enough.

				MXE, then MDMA, then 2 CB, then K<br /><br />About half your &quot;max&quot;/normal dose of each. Wait til each has peaked before moving on...<br /><br />If you are reckless enough to smoke some DMT after, you probably won&#039;t be disappointed...<br /><br />Consuming is mindless; combining is art ;)<br /><br />

				this has been something i have started toying with more since getting on SR.<br />i must say, i think LSD &amp; MDMA synthesize so well. but i think it is much better you wait a few hours before touching the MDMA, just let the acid do its thing until you start to get to peak. then, when yer in the thick of it, that X hits you like a ton of bricks and things get so crazy.<br />i love it.&nbsp; but, one time i took the X too early, with a higher dose of acid and it didn&#039;t work out as well; i mean, i had a blast while the X was on, but then it started going away and I was left in a weird state where i didn&#039;t really realize how hard the acid still had me, so it ended up getting a little dark. but yeah.<br /><br />i am actually planning to try hippy flipping and/or kitty flipping in the near future.

				It is entirely subjective, but honestly, this is the most &quot;average&quot; number I could summarize in my head based on my experience with people who have NEVER DONE PURE MDMA BEFORE (in my area, MDMA is extremely hard to come by, even for reasonably connected people). For these people, 100-150mg of MDMA parachuted or anally ingested, is enough to produce a fucking hard roll for 5-6 hours, with a minimal comedown and MDMA hang-over.<br /><br />Plus, for people like this, 200-300ug of LSD is, by any standard, a heavy dose. Even someone like me, who has some moderate experience with LSD and level 3-4 experiences, (and I&#039;m a big guy too; 200lbs), 200-300ug is a heavy dose. Again, for people who do it extremely rarely, or never, these doses are considered very heavy.<br /><br />Not everybody has battle axe tolerances. I did state EXPLICITLY, that my numbers were the best averages for normal joe-blows.<br /><br />For heavier users, clearly the option would be just to bump the doses up by a few tens of percentages :) But yeah, I give those numbers by a loose definition, with no motivation to write up proper dosings, as I think combos are really not as rewarding as just increasing dosages of the active and intricate substance at hand (the psychedelic drug, 99% of the time)

For these people, 100-150mg of MDMA parachuted or anally ingested, is enough to produce a fucking hard roll for 5-6 hours, with a minimal comedown and MDMA hang-over.<br /><br />Plus, for people like this, 200-300ug of LSD is, by any standard, a heavy dose.

If you aren&#039;t familiar with LSD and its effects, then even 150ug is a very heavy dose... It also depends on your propensity to psychedelic-sensitive responses. If you trip hard by nature on small doses (not a band thing; more rewarding, lighter on your wallet). 200ug is a VERY heavy dose for a newbie, and I think it would just produce something that is too much to make any sense of.<br /><br />Then again, there are veterans on here that think all newbies should have their first trip just be a fucking mind-bender... But I disagree, I think newbies should work their way up through levels of tripping over time, so they can have a good idea of set and setting and know what to expect at least... Most people, like you, get scared away from an otherwise absolutely beautiful and holy drug by tripping too hard on your first time, I just think it&#039;s stupid.<br /><br />When taken intelligently and with good preparation, acid is bar far, BY FAR, the best drug in existence, nothing even comes close to the rewards you can get from LSD or Shrooms for that matter

Yeah, you&#039;ll have a blast, but really the suicidal tuesdays is unavoidable, no matter what you take to mitigate that serotonin imbalance and receptor blindness.

				Just to chime in on the whole candyflip /&nbsp; hippyflip posts (esp. the candyflip) as well as a few other combos that are pretty amazing.<br /><br />I have had many experiences with many drug combos, all in controlled environments with plenty of prior reading to each. My previous degree was in pharmacology so I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m pretty safe in the knowledge of what the combinations.<br /><br />In terms of the hippyflip, always good fun. Something I found was that nausea could be a problem (both drugs are known to play with your stomach, especially the shrooms)<br />If you&#039;re dosing on what you&#039;d consider a &#039;comfortable&#039; quantity of shrooms then the MD (from my experience) detracts from the overall trip... but it does add a new twist to it.<br /><br />As for the candyflip. If I really want to blow my mind I may use MD as a safety net. Drop a few more tabs then I normally would, wait half an hour and take low dose MD. <br />One thing I keep reading here is that it would appear that most people are only taking single doses of MD whilst candyflipping? This is something I&#039;d recommend against- what happens when it wears off and all you&#039;re left with is an empty LSD feeling? There&#039;s room there for an unpleasant experience.<br />If you&#039;re going to candy flip then ALWAYS have enough MD to sustain you through the duration of your trip, and only take in relatively small doses as it still works wonders. If you&#039;re into the big fucked up feeling then go ahead with the bigger doses of MD! But again I feel it detracts from the mind exploring abilities of most psychedelics. <br /><br />Correct me if I&#039;m wrong but that&#039;s why it&#039;s all called xxxflip- you flip from a few seconds of being wired on MD and then you flip back to trippy.<br /><br />Something else that I quite like is MD followed up by Na-GHB on the comedown. It takes the edge off whilst adding a new level of euphoria and allows for a more peaceful sleep... not to mention the sexual properties it brings.<br />I would exercise great caution here however as typical GHB doses vary wildly in liquid form (if you&#039;re getting GHB at all) so I always stick to Na-GHB powder from a trusted supplier. Something else is that GHB has quite a narrow therapeutic window meaning that, for example, a 2g dose might be perfect but add another half gram and you&#039;ll be asleep.<br /><br />Something that I read earlier that was slightly concerning was someone who enjoyed the combo of MXE and MDMA. I&#039;d strongly recommend taking these two substances even 24 hours apart. MXE is marketed as a ketamine analogue though its actual actions are not as similar as the ones marketing it would have you believe. I think this combination can be severely neurotoxic and should best be avoided. I remember a case of a northern European girl who mixed the two on one occasion and died, please don&#039;t ask me for the citation, google is your friend ;)<br /><br />K however, following a night on MD (or even when you&#039;re on it!) is really nice. Adds a warm comforting feeling and takes away the strange feeling many report with taking ketamine alone.<br /><br />I don&#039;t condone mixing substances without any prior knowledge of the effects or consequences. There are plenty of resources available online (won&#039;t name any in case of rules) and anyone wishing to experiment with combinations should investigate before trying. Some combos can be amazing fun, some less so.<br /><br />If anyone else has any ideas for some new combos I&#039;m all ears!!

BUT MOST people like it LSD then MDMA.. The issue with doing the MDMA first is that it wears off and you have 5 to 6 hours of LSD still kicking in your system and it can take you to a dark place on the come down.. Most people that like to do the MDMA first then the LSD tend to have something else to chase it with like GHB, Benzo ect.. <br /><br />&nbsp;By doing the LSD first you can have the strong peak of the LSD fly the universe then drop the MDMA and peak again but with the added hyper color, OEV, CEV that LSD has to offer on the come down.. <br /><br />as for the dosage , if you have quality MDMA you don&#039;t need 250mg on a flip.. 150mg will do you and if an hour later your not where you want to be drop a tiny bit more.. but re-dosing is not advised as common practice .. <br /><br /><br />Edited for a note on Plugging ( AKA anal administration) Just as with sublingual ( allowing it to melt in your mouth mostly under the tongue and not swallowing your saliva for 15 - 20 mins) it bypasses the first level of your metabolism allowing more of the MDMA to gain access to your system. The membranes in both&nbsp; areas of the system (mouth and rectal tissue) are very thin and allow for come up to be obtained faster and less product lost VS Oral. When taken Orally you lose some product to the acid in your digestive tract. Come up for Sublingual and Plugging is about the same 15 to 20 mins give or take a bit.. I have had a Sulingual dose hit me on a full tummy in less then 5 mins before.. That is another advantage to plugging or Sublingaul administration, You can eat before hand and not have it effect your come up or roll time.. In fact if you eat a really healthy meal like a nice salad with a little protein like grilled chicken or boiled egg it will help the roll and you will have a softer come down.. <br /><br />&nbsp;My fav for MDMA is sublingual by far, my other half ( who is male btw) seems to like plugging the best... We both like to take our dosages and then chase them with 5 hour energy drinks, NOT monster or red bull, 5 Hour Energy.. You system uses the B vits as fuel for your roll and eases the come down.. 5HTP to follow on the come down..<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i never got any mdma from the streets. i only rolled on mdma from here, 84%.

				Yeah but the problem that they probably don&#039;t describe is the emotionally crippling aftermath of ingesting such a retarded amount of MDMA.<br /><br />It&#039;s unavoidable with such a sheer amount. 800mg of pure MDMA is just... I don&#039;t even know, I wouldn&#039;t even dream of taking that much, regardless of tolerance, it&#039;s a stupid amount. The risk of neurotoxicity to the substance is massive, and now doubt can risk permanent issues with low serotonin and/or receptors not binding with serotonin, and will have to live the rest of their lives on medication.<br /><br />You want to roll for 12 hours? Do it. Just prepare yourself mentally for the fucking horrifyingly, mind-boggling depression in the following week. Because you are going to want to kill yourself :P<br /><br />That&#039;s basically the reason I only ever touch MDMA or any kind of pills every 4-5 months at the MOST, because after a while, the come-down FAR outweighs the good time for me, and all I can associate the &quot;pinging&quot; feeling with is the dread and despair that follows it up.<br /><br />Just be safe please :)

				and you think 800 is too mutch? the people here, that buys mdma from the streets, usually per night, use 1gr. many people here roll for 12 hours straight. there are people here going up to 2 or 3g&#039;s per night<br /><br />and yes, the depression is bad.. but i have tried several mdma&#039;s from here, and one haven&#039;t give almost any depression.. neither to me, that used about 200 or 250 in that night, neither to my friends that used 800mg. <br /><br />

				well i dont know where you guys are from, <br />and what kind of bad quality mdma you get on the streets<br />but 1g (or even 2-3) for one single person in one night is just surreal and stupid.<br />i guess ,maybe , it could be a one time thing but i cant imagine people doing this on a regular basis.<br />there are so many other good drugs for rolling 12h with less of a comedown like amphetamine or cocaine<br />where i come from people would take 0,5 max over a 12h period. cause they have other/better drugs<br />

				2-3 grams of MDMA... Have you personally witnessed this or is this what these people are telling you?<br /><br />There are people who have axe-wound tolerances to Meth and MDMA, nd 500-600mg of pure (key word: pure) MDMA is enough to knock them on their ass, obviously unless they&#039;ve been doing it daily...<br /><br />But beyond that 600-700, even 800mg mark.....ugh...&nbsp; if you&#039;ve taken it so frequently that you need anything more than 400-500mg to get a decent roll for a decent amount of time, I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;ve just put yourself at an enormous risk of neurotoxicity and subsequent serotonin problems in the aftermath. <br /><br />I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve seen anyone&#039;s lives &quot;ruined&quot; by taking too much Molly, but I&#039;ve definitely seen people get a depressed, anti-social personally be amplified, and the only times they are happy is when they are on drugs.<br /><br />Drugs aren&#039;t supposed to make real life worse, they&#039;re supposed to empower your sober thoughts and make you feel better about yourself. <br /><br />Just my 2c worth of dick<br /><br />Tell your friends to stop being silly willies

The longer the roll with continual redoses, the worse the comedown and risk of neurotoxicity.<br /><br />If you were to take a big-ass hit of like 400-500 in one go and not take any more, your serotonin receptors won&#039;t be fucked from such a CONTINUING surge of serotonin transmitters thus causing a &quot;blindness&quot; per se to transmitters, instead, they will adapt accordingly for the brief (5-6 hours of intense rolling) surge of serotonin, and then allow for a speedy return to baseline excitation, rather than just being chronically damaged from the continuing surge.<br /><br />&quot;more&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily mean &quot;better&quot;. It works the same way as vitamins: Pushing 100x the dose of multivitamins doesnt make your body absorb more, it basically just shuts down the gates of receptors and the entire lot just becomes wastage. Same with serotonin. &quot;more&quot; and &quot;more of it&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;better&quot;, eventually, your serotonin receptors just &quot;turn off&quot; and it takes fucking AGES to get a normal excitation flow again.<br /><br />This is why pharmacological testing on humans recommended only a &quot;single&quot; re-dose, and allow for the chemical to ride out. Continual re-dosing is just not a good idea.<br /><br />Shove it up your ass, seriously. The best way. Snort it if you must, but up the ass is where it&#039;s at. no homo
