				OKAY.... whats the fucking deal with all the BUYERS not finishing there review&#039;s ???? EVERY VENDORS PAGES HAS 3 to 4 pages of buyer&#039;s saying &quot; FE will update when tested product&quot; .... First thing i have to say is DONT FE.. second if u have to/ made to COME BACK and give your HONEST review about the product!!! dont just leave the rest of your fellow SR member wondering how the product was... something has to be done about this

				I think what happens is that once it comes in the mail, the customer is excited that it actually came and doesn&#039;t care enough to go back and update. Some vendors ask people to FE if they think they&#039;re not gunna finalize once it comes instead of letting it auto finalize. Usually with feedback that&#039;s 1-3 weeks old and it says &quot;FE will update&quot; I assume they&#039;re still waiting for it, which will keep me away from that vendor. If it&#039;s older than that it probably came.<br /><br />Maybe SR should implement some feature that will let users know if a FE&#039;d review has arrived or not. That would be pretty nice.

				I am new and wondering about this myself.<br />I agree with both comments.<br /><br />QUESTION::<br />I made my first order, finalized early as seller requested, now &quot;Feedback&quot; for that order is displayed in my Order Page.<br />Do I need to submit the feedback in order to complete finalizing the order???<br />Or does it go through and I can leave it after ?&nbsp; (remember its fe)<br /><br />Seeing all that &quot;FE WILL UPDATE&quot; feedback on every SR item leads me to believe I have to submit the feedback in order to continue the finalization process?

				You guys are ALL RIGHT!!<br /><br />trust me, as a vendor I wish no one did this either. I have been mostly lucky but it drives me insane too.<br /><br />They get their product, then they figure out pretty quickly that there is nothing to complain about....then they don&#039;t come back to SR until they want to buy something else. :\<br /><br />Thats my theory.<br />

				I probably make this post once a week. NEWBIES READ FURTHER<br /><br />FE is not that evil of a thing, but you do it at your own risk. IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO IT DO NOT WRITE A REVIEW. <br /><br />Just leave it in your orders tab and then come back to write a review when you get your product. When you click finalize you can then browse the site without leaving any feedback it is an option and SR needs to make this more clear. All you have to do is go back to your orders section to complete the review that you never wrote.<br /><br />&quot;FE&quot; HELPS NO ONE .

				+1 flicky42<br /><br />That&#039;s what I thought.&nbsp; I have not left the feedback for an item I have not received yet, and I can&#039;t believe so much of the feedback on items are from people 5/5 before they receive the item.&nbsp; In fact - I just read a forum post complaining about an item, it got alot of complaints on the forum by buyers.&nbsp; Yet on the sellers page that same item feedback is all&nbsp; 5/5 &quot;FE early for best!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Haha.

				I will be reviewing all of my purchase.&nbsp; The way I see it is that if we want the community to grow stronger, we need to weed out the bad venders.&nbsp; This includes giving good reviews to the people who deserve it.

				For real, these guys have to make an option to FE but leave feedback at another time... and there should be some kind of reminder to the buyer to remind his/her high ass to leave some feedback on the product so we can make better more informed decisions on what product to use and what seller to buy from.... also.. maybe SR can throw in&nbsp; kinda like a questionaire regarding the product..<br /><br /><br />could go something like this..<br /><br />did the description&nbsp; match the product?<br />was the weight/quantity on?<br />was the shipping done in a professional manner?<br />was the contact good between you and the seller/.<br />ect ect ect<br /><br />or even a 1 on 10 scale...<br /><br />I look forward to seeing something like this working soon!<br /><br />

				I agree, I hate going on my feedback and sifting through the &quot;FE&quot; or &quot;Leave Feedback Here.&quot; Sometimes people do update it and I like when they write something like:<br /><br />&quot;Received product but have not tested yet.<br /><br />EDIT: Product is amazing!! blah blah blah&quot;<br /><br />You could also check the forums, if you&#039;ve ever purchased from me I ask you to leave a review on my official thread over at the rumor mill but almost no one ever does it lol I think they just get high and forget.

				i agree, hate not knowing cause sometimes i decide not to order from the vendor if I am worried the orders arent arriving. plus i really appreciate reviews and read all the recent ones when trying to decide which vendor to use.<br /><br />and FE most certainly is evil! The only two times I have lost money was due to FE... once with GummyStars and once with Tony. People should seriously think twice before doing it. I will not purchase from a vendor requiring FE period. Sometimes i will decide to for my favorites who are long term like LexiSadie though.

				In short nothing. There needs to be an update with the option of leaving feedback later if you fe.

				You can already leave feedback later if you FE.&nbsp; There is no obligation to leave feedback at all.<br />A note on the finalize page telling folks this would be very advantageous.<br />I also really Moon Fried&#039;s idea of an alert or popup when you have feedback due, to remind folks to do it.<br /><br />What I hate even more than not leaving feedback, is bastards who don&#039;t finalize at all, and just leave after they order.&nbsp; Waiting 17 days to get paid for something you know couldn&#039;t have taken any more than 10 days is frustrating.&nbsp; If it&#039;s not there yet, please, let me know so I can reship or something, but don&#039;t leave me hanging!<br />I&#039;ve compiled a personal list of customers who do this regularly.&nbsp; Once I can understand a mistake, twice leads me to say, fuck that noise.<br /><br />Also, weirdos who leave feedback, and it doesn&#039;t even sound like the product you sold them.&nbsp; It&#039;s like they can&#039;t keep their own orders straight in their head.&nbsp; I had one guy say I gave him a full refund... he still gave me a 5/5, but wtf?&nbsp; I&#039;ve only ever had to refund someone once, and it was just a cancelled order, not a real refund.
