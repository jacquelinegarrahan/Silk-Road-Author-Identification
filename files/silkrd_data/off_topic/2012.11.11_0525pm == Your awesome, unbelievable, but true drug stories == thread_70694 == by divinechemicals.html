				Most drug users have had some pretty crazy, fun nights. Things happen that are so insane, you would call it unrealistic if it happened in a movie. This is the thread to share those stories. It&#039;s inspired by the night I had yesterday.<br /><br />So I know that my brother is having a few people over at his place to do molly. I would have rolled myself, but I just did it last week, so I don&#039;t want to fry my brain. Anyways, I come over a couple hours into their roll. I walk inside and hear nothing. I go upstairs to find three people sitting in a bed together: my brother, some other guy, and a fucking hot girl who is completely naked. They all look at me, obviously a little surprised that I just walked in. Then they just start talking to me happily because they&#039;re still rolling balls. The rest of the night, this girl was nude. She did not put clothes on. She kept kissing me. Eventually we all chilled and smoked a bowl as they came down. It was the trippiest night of my life, shrooms and LSD use notwithstanding. You should know that I didn&#039;t have sex with her because I don&#039;t want to take advantage of some drugged up girl. This was also her first time rolling, so that just wouldn&#039;t sit well with me. But if you&#039;d told me yesterday morning that I&#039;d be smoking weed with a gorgeous naked girl, my brother, and some other guy, I would have called you crazy. More girls need to be open like that! Holy shit. I tried to just take it all in stride, but it was just so fucking random. <br /><br />Okay, your stories.

				I was dealing ecstasy at around 17 or 18 years old, I got my friend in highschool to start dealing pills for me as well, fronted him something like 100 pills. Some random guy we still dont know to this day, called my friend said he knew me, my friend never bothered to check with me if I knew this guy. He went to meet the guy to sell him 60 pills, when he let the guy in his car he got maced, and then he foguth back, the guy stabbed and killed my friend. We still havent found out who it was and probably never will. After this I never bothered selling drugs.. I really will never sell drugs face to face its too heat bag and I feel horrible about what happened to my friend. I will be trying to sell on silk road and see how that goes but I guess I would give a different twist to your thread with this story.

				Man bigpoppa, I&#039;m really sorry to hear that. Hopefully this doesn&#039;t make me come across as a giant asshole, but I was really thinking this thread could be a little more lighthearted. Like fun stories about awesome nights you had on drugs. That&#039;s not to take away from the shitty thing that happened to your friend, that really sucks. I&#039;d just rather the thread have more fun stories instead of sad stories about drugs gone wrong. Really sorry about your friend though. I&#039;m really not trying to be an asshole.

				Lol love the MDMA one, I can relate. The first time I took the MDMA + 2c-b combo there was me, two other guys and two other girls. We must of taken about 250mg&#039;s of Ivory&#039;s MDMA each before we even touched the 2c-b so we were so fucked up already. I can remember all 5 of us getting butt naked and running though a field (a public field, lol) and then laying down all hugging in this field watching the sun set listening to some amazing music. Luckily no one saw us but my god, it was incredible. When we got back to the house were the 2c-b was at, we all snorted the chemical and started tripping, hard (still naked). All I can remember was seeing some beautiful hallucinations and kissing one of the girls for about 2 hours straight and not getting bored haha. I can really see why they call it the love/cuddle drug, lol. Was probably one of the best nights of my life!&nbsp; <br />In fact I think all the best nights of my life involved rollin ballz with close friends. &lt;3 MDMA.

				2 days into a binge me and a group of friends were really fucked up : MXE, AMT, 2CB, MDMA and a wholeee load of pot. things were fucking werid as it was me and a friend went to the shop to buy alcohol, we returned partly naked bleeding and crying. <br /><br />We decided to remove some clothing in the shop as it was warm, my friend decided to steal kinder eggs, we left the shop flagged down a car and delivered the freshly stole kinder eggs to the child in the passenger seat. <br /><br />This random kids dad was not happy about us doing this, my friends also had only his boxers on. HE punched him and chased us for a while beat us up and we returned to the house .<br /><br />im no rapist child molestor. But it was a good FUCKING idea at the time. we pretty much forgot when we got back, that was a werid binge.

				True story: A friend of mine texted me early in the day asking if she could come over later to smoke up with me, sure no problem. She gets here, we have lunch, smoke a bowl or two. She tells me that there&#039;s a rave going on at her college (I used to go there myself) and has a hook up for MDMA crystals in caps, invites me to go and offers me the caps. I say sure, why the fuck not. goes to pack up for the evening/night because I knew I&#039;d be staying in her dorm room. I decide to take my last 4 hits of LSD because I wanted to candy-flip (note. I HAVE NEVER EVER DONE MDMA). Went to her college dorm and everything, got the capsule, I was examining it because I&#039;ve never seen it in crystal form. and of course my friend wanted to see it as well but she pulled on the cap too hard, causing it to break apart, spilling the goddamn MDMA on the floor. The cat actually went to lick the floor where the MDMA fell, we swear that she (cat) was tripping balls all night. Luckily I had brought my 4 hits of cid (never done that amount in one sitting and never in public ever before). Took the cid. went to the rave, ran into SO MANY FUCKING PEOPLE I KNEW from my former life including my history teacher. He was talking to me, asking questions such as &quot;how&#039;s school&quot; and all while I was tripping balls in front of him. I think I was the only person on cid at the rave, everyone else were on MDMA/X or some other shit. so many people knew that I was on something differently but I wouldn&#039;t tell them what exactly. never again.

				Waking up after 2 days sleep after being awake for 12 days, and having a double NoS hit shoved in my face.... that was pretty weird and time-warpy. Instantly went from lying down in my room to suddenly standing up in the kitchen talking to my friend then glitched back to lying down in my room.<br /><br />The whole experience was absurd, especially due to the fact that I couldn&#039;t move for about 30mins after waking.

				Sorry, all my stories are apparently going to be about MDMA and sex. This weekend has been unbelievable. I had sold this girl and her friend some molly earlier today, really really good shit. So she calls me about an hour in, rolling balls, and tells me her friend abandoned her for some dumb reason. So she says over the phone, &quot;Hey, come have sex with me.&quot; I&#039;ve never driven faster. We&#039;ve had a thing going, but we&#039;ve never actually hooked up or anything. We couldn&#039;t go to her house because she had family over, so we went to the fucking woods at night and found a secluded spot. What a night. Except now I have a million bug bites on me. Still worth it. I fucking love this weekend. I feel like I&#039;ve been rolling all day, but instead of drugs, on LIFE. (Cue cheesy 80s PSA music)
