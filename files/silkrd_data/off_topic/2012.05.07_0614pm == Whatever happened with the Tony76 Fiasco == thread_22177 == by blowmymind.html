				Hey dude,<br />I was wondering the same thing.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t receive product, and it had been over 2 weeks.&nbsp; Usually it came in 4 days.&nbsp; Before he went into stealth mode claiming &quot;he was restocking and coming with a new product,&quot; he said he would resend package.&nbsp; I never heard from again, and it looks like he has completely went into the dark as he claimed he would be back in 48 hours after being in stealth mode.&nbsp; I hope the Silk Road administrators are looking into this, because he was a great reliable seller that may have had the last laugh in the end.

				I was referring to the shit storm that occurred after his disappearance all the speculation on the forums etc. I haven&#039;t seen any follow ups nor have I heard his name mentioned anywhere. Also I&#039;m wondering did he honor any 4/20 orders? Was he just taking his time to do so...or was it a scam. There doesn&#039;t seem to have been a definitive conclusion reached? Maybe I&#039;m missing something here.

				Kappacino is right. The Silk Road is supposed to be the place you can go to get away from all the bullshit of IRL dealing. People like Tony screw it up for everyone. There&#039;s supposed to be some sort of honor system in place when you have that much power. He could have just as easily told everyone that he was leaving the site. I mean people would have been disappointed, but in &quot;Oh we&#039;re sorry to see you go&quot; kind of way, not a &quot;If Tony was here I&#039;d chop off his balls and choke him to death with them&quot; kind of way. I see the Silk Road as a community, and we have no place for assholes that are going to screw over their customers like that. It&#039;s one thing to make a lot of money and decide that your time is up. I think the most respectful thing a top vendor can do when he decides to retire is create a thread in the forum that basically says, &quot;Hey guys, I&#039;ve enjoyed my time here, but I gotta go before the game is up.&quot; Any vendor that makes his last move screwing over the customers that got him where he is, well I have no respect for that person.

				Hey everyone that got ripped-off. Did you finalize early or have an OOE out of escrow deal? If you did than YOU are to blame!! Be mad at yourselves for being naive and or not following the rules. Nobody is trustworthy and escrow protects us all. Taking short cuts leads to disasters. You already know better and still&nbsp; you let yourself be taken advantage of. Everyone that stayed within escrow will get there bitcoins back. Everyone else should find another site. FM

				&nbsp;:) Wow! Did I learn a freaking lesson... the only reason why I FE early was because of his solid reputation as a vendor. I can&#039;t believe he would flush that type of Cash Flow down the drain... I swear when I get my product in that I will become one of the best vendors on this freaking site. <br />Fuck him, and that fuck that shady low brow shit.<br />There... I said it. I&#039;m moving on.

				I never had any dealings with Tony76, but he was the top rated seller on SR and every post I read was in praise of him and the quality of his product. Why would someone trash their successful business in favour of a short term scam? Was there more money in scamming than in continuing his his business?<br /><br />Do we know for sure it was a scam? In this line of business there&#039;s other reasons for an overnight disappearance like being busted or ODing.

				I cant understand why most seem to want to believe this to be a friendly community of persons that share the same interest.<br />maybe this is true from a buyers prespective but think about it for a minute of 2.<br /><br />this is still a black market dealing with drugs, only difference IMO is quality and convenience to most of us.<br />these are still dealers , yet most probably higher on the food chain.<br />its the nature of the beast. Dont think for a second that your vendor gives a shit about you except for those coins.<br />Of course their friendly b/c buyers are paying the bills for them.<br />once the opportunity arises that they can take the money and run with no recourse then due to mostly shady human nature thats exactly what they will do.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Silk Road, as I reported previously, is the online illicit drug marketplace that has defied law enforcement efforts to close it down.&nbsp; Last month, Silk Road reported the greatest scam in its fifteen-month history, which cost the site’s users over a hundred thousand dollars in just two days.<br /><br />Silk Road’s vendors live and die by their reputation and feedback, which buyers give much as they do on eBay.&nbsp; Nobody on Silk Road had a better reputation or more enthusiastic feedback than Tony76, a vendor of heroin, stimulants and psychedelics from Canada.<br /><br />The site has a system of escrow in place – a user places an order, money goes into escrow and the user releases it once the order has been received.&nbsp; Any disputes can be referred to the site’s administrators for resolution.<br /><br />However, ‘trusted vendors’ have always been allowed to request that users ‘finalize early’ – release the funds immediately.&nbsp; New members to the site are often asked to do so until they prove themselves to be ‘trusted buyers’, and sellers will ask for early finalisation when bitcoin – the virtual currency used to trade on the site – is fluctuating wildly.<br /><br />A few days before the great ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’ held on April 20, Tony76 posted in the forums that he was being targeted by a vindictive rival seller who had threatened to set up bogus buyer accounts to order thousands of dollars of drugs in “multiple orders, in multiple names, from multiple states”. Tony would have no way of knowing which were the bogus accounts and would lose the money not released from escrow.<br /><br />‘Don’t worry’ came the flood of replies from Silk Road’s community.&nbsp; ‘Everyone knows and trusts you, Tony.&nbsp; To avoid this horrible scammer, just make everyone finalize early.’<br /><br />So when Silk Road held the ‘420 Sale and Giveaway’, the site’s highest-grossing and most trusted vendor, “Tony76”, jumped on board, offering fabulous discounts on his products and for the first time ever opened up shop to buyers outside North America.&nbsp; Orders flooded in from users well accustomed to receiving high quality goods from this seller and from new users, excited to have the chance to buy from such an esteemed identity.<br /><br />And Tony, sadly, had to ask all buyers to finalize early until he could sort out the situation with the scammer.&nbsp; And of course they did.&nbsp; He was the most highly respected and prolific seller on Silk Road; the buyers had had countless transactions that went smoothly; anyway, to not finalize might mean missing out on a bargain.<br /><br />A week later the rumblings started.&nbsp; The local orders should have arrived by now.&nbsp; Tony wasn’t answering messages.&nbsp; The bespoke site Tony had set up was gone.<br /><br />Two weeks later the rumbles became a roar as it became clear that the most trusted vendor on Silk Road had absconded with what buyers estimated was over a hundred thousand dollars for a single weekend’s work.&nbsp; One moderator of the forums placed it at a cool quarter of a million dollars.<br /><br />There followed much angst and hand-wringing going on at Silk Road.&nbsp; Some believed Tony76 was killed by Mexican drug lords.&nbsp; Others assumed he had been busted. Many refused to believe that someone in their ‘Community’ would do such a thing. Then came the conspiracy theories: he is already selling under another name; Silk Road’s owners are in on it; it’s all part of a worldwide sting and nobody is safe; Tony76 is actually a Canadian bikie gang.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest surprise to take from this is the number of people who are shocked that a drug dealer would rip them off.&nbsp; Silk Road’s advice:&nbsp; never trade outside of escrow.<br /><br />It’s a lesson that will stay with their customers for a long time.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>http://allthingsvice.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/the-great-420-scam/<br /><br />I had no idea it was that much money until reading this.

				HAhaha. Tony tried to dick me over on my last and largest order. Not sure of that thread has been dismantles, as I haven&#039;t gone back since &quot;the fiasco&quot;. But if it&#039;s there, you can see me bitch him out, and tell him I&#039;d rather cancel than release funds. <br />Am I the ONLY person who didn&#039;t get fucked? Seriously? Yes, I got my order, the very same day/week all that happened. It was way fat, too. Maybe I got some of yours? lol It&#039;s a joke, not worthy of negative karma, but I am sure a couple dead goat blowers will cpa one on me because THEY went out of escrow. <br />Next up is the guy who requires early finalize for $1000 QPs of herb! Yeah, right,I&#039;ll just kick that grand right on over to you......just as soon as I got that QP in my door. <br />Like EVERYONE keeps saying don&#039;t finalize early, but if we followed that rule, there&#039;d only by a handful of vendors. <br />Most vendors require FE if yuo&#039;re outside their immediate area, international, new, etc. Some don&#039; use DCN, so FE is only way to not get fucked themselves. <br />Ah, the drug game....keep playin.....maybe someday you&#039;ll win.

				We created Tony.&nbsp; By attacking any naysayer, anybody who claimed ripoff, we paved the way for him.&nbsp; I&#039;m already seeing it again, where buyers are beginning to worship vendors, acting like they can do no wrong, and attacking anybody who doesn&#039;t kiss their favorite vendor&#039;s ass.&nbsp; Whenever vendors start complaining about &#039;ripoff buyers&#039;, my antennna go up...because what follows next is usually the real rip.&nbsp; Always enclosed in a need for buyers to finalize early.&nbsp; The slick part of these scams is that vendors get the buyers themselves to do their dirty work.&nbsp; When Tony did it, there were people who questioned, but they were attacked by other buyers...so they got what they deserved.<br /><br />These are just drug dealers, people: they aren&#039;t your friends, and they don&#039;t have hearts of gold.&nbsp; If somebody says they got ripped, don&#039;t be so quick to take vendor&#039;s side.&nbsp; Read thru the first 20 pages of Tony&#039;s review thread.&nbsp; You&#039;ll see...

Especially for new users...&nbsp; If I ever order I&#039;ll be request a DCN before finalizing at the very least.. But even that cuts down your choices.. most venders don&#039;t provide them even..<br /><br />But as we have seen you cant FE just because a seller has a good rep. (I certainly wouldn&#039;t)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree: times have changed on here...used to be nobody had to FE and all vendors stayed in escrow...but in just this short year, all this has changed radcally, and I realize how hard it is for new vendors....My suggestion would probably be just to start small, and study the forums, see who is trusted, then go from there...there are good H vendors who sell excellent product, no problems....lately No GenRx is best on here, but there are others...<br /><br />Or newbies could start like me and others with pharmaceutical vendors while building reps there are plenty of good trusted vendors of dilaudids and such....<br /><br />I probably need to change my sig...I don&#039;t always follow it myself, either....it&#039;s just good advice...generally ;)
