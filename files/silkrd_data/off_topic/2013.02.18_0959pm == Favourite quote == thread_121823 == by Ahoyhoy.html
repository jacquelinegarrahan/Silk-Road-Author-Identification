				I love quotes of Arthur Rimbaud. Many of them are bitter-sweet, but all of them are beautifully poetic.<br /><br />&quot;I understand, and not knowing how to express myself without pagan words, I&#039;d rather remain silent.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A poet makes himself a visionary through a long, boundless, and systematized disorganization of all the senses. All forms of love, of suffering, of madness; he searches himself, he exhausts within himself all poisons, and preserves their quintessences. Unspeakable torment, where he will need the greatest faith, a superhuman strength, where he becomes all men the great invalid, the great criminal, the great accursed--and the Supreme Scientist! For he attains the unknown! Because he has cultivated his soul, already rich, more than anyone! He attains the unknown, and if, demented, he finally loses the understanding of his visions, he will at least have seen them! So what if he is destroyed in his ecstatic flight through things unheard of, unnameable: other horrible workers will come; they will begin at the horizons where the first one has fallen!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;In the morning I had a look so lost, a face so dead, that perhaps those whom I met did not see me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I shed more tears than God could ever have required.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Idle youth, enslaved to everything; by being too sensitive I have wasted my life.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He would say, &quot;How funny it will all seem, all you&#039;ve gone through, when I&#039;m not here anymore, when you no longer feel my arms around your shoulders, nor my heart beneath you, nor this mouth on your eyes, because I will have to go away some day, far away...&quot; And in that instant I could feel myself with him gone, dizzy with fear, sinking down into the most horrible blackness: into death.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And from that time on I bathed in the Poem<br />Of the Sea, star-infused and churned into milk,<br />Devouring the green azures; where, entranced in pallid flotsam,<br />A dreaming drowned man sometimes goes down.&quot;<br /><br /><br />And my favorite:<br /><br />&quot;Evening prayer<br /><br />I spend my life sitting, like an angel in a barber&#039;s chair,<br />Holding a beer mug with deep-cut designs,<br />My neck and gut both bent, while in the air<br />A weightless veil of pipe smoke hangs.<br /><br />Like steaming dung within an old dovecote<br />A thousand Dreams within me softly burn:<br />From time to time my heart is like some oak<br />Whose blood runs golden where a branch is torn.<br /><br />And then, when I have swallowed down my Dreams<br />In thirty, forty mugs of beer, I turn<br />To satisfy a need I can&#039;t ignore,<br /><br />And like the Lord of Hyssop and of Myrrh<br />I piss into the skies, a soaring stream<br />That consecrates a patch of flowering fern.&quot;<br /><br />:&#039;(
