				I have been having a couple of rough weeks, the weight on my shoulders seems to much to bare sometimes. I picked my grandmother up from the nursing home to spend the day her, shes 97. she reminded me of when i was younger, and how she watched me grow up. it really put me at a peace of mind. I have been put in treatment for suicidal thoughts and drug addictions. I wanted to take a moment to say that we are all blessed in this life, and the sun will come up tomorrow. Love your family, and Love to the SR community! - peace<br /><br />

				Sorry to hear about the rough times you are experiencing. It is great you got to spend some time with a loved one, and I&#039;m glad you were able to clear your mind and experience a feeling of joy.<br /><br />I hope everything with you plays out for the best. Remember you have people on your side that are pulling for you.<br /><br />Like you said, the sun will come up tomorrow.<br /><br />Also refer to another saying... &quot;Remember my friend, the sun always comes out after the rain&quot;. It may rain for a long time, but you will see the light at some point.

				Yes every cloud has silver lining, Life is oh so very short you see. You have to live for the moment, before we know it we will be the same age as your dear grandmother. Lets live for the moment, and help each other along the way. They say the biggest regret of the dying is the lack of time spent with family, and not doing everything they dreamed of. peace!
