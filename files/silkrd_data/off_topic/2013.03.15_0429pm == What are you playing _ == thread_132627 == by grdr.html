This is update with crack. awakening DLC will be 5 episodes so I guess you won;t need any previous saves to&nbsp; play through them ( wel I hope so). Trine is not so big game if you haven&#039;t played it first try trine 1. i don&#039;t like it that much but its quite good.

				I&#039;ve soon finished Far Cry 3, a game that has completely blown me away. Fun, emotionally engaging, and the main characters pumps himself full of somany drugs it&#039;s borderline ridiculous. try it if you don&#039;t have already :D<br /><br />Other than that I haven&#039;t played many games lately. Cards and chess a couple of times each week. And some social games every now and then.

After I finished the game, I started a new file and didn&#039;t liberate any outposts, so I just go sneaking around the jungle stealth killing just about anyone I see. Many hours were spent playing the role of super stealth ninja assassin. I never used cars in that game. Made the gameplay much more satisfying.

				everyone who played far cry 3 should have turned HUD off, so aiming down the sights and running around the jungle felt like a fking RAMBO haha with all that weaponry.. Also who&#039;s playing crysis 3 ? Also mass effect 3 citadel ? any mass effect fans here ? I know mass effect 3 ending sucks balls so much but I heard alot of people really liked Citadel DLC. :)
