				It is dependent on the PDF program and how it handles loading external content. The same is true for word documents, if they have a picture hotlinked from a website in them and you open them, and don&#039;t have the document viewer configured to go through Tor, it will make a direct connection to the server the image is on. It is hardly hacking it is just taking advantage of peoples lack of knowledge of applications to trick them into revealing their IP addresses. These are called proxy bypass attacks. There are some really subtle ones. Don&#039;t drag and drop pictures from the browser to desktop if you use Unity.

Just be careful if you visit UMB though, it really is a complete den of sin. There is some really dirty people on there that offer/request really nasty shit. I went there once out of curiosity because someone posted the URL on here and someone was asking to buy an 11-13 year old boy to use as a &quot;house boy&quot; (whatever the fuck that is, I don&#039;t want to know to be honest). Anyway after seeing that I just got straight out of there and there is no way I&#039;d go back. It&#039;s chopped full of scammers too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yep, just had a look, there&#039;s some guy selling his 15 year old sister on there at the moment, pretty damn gross, and it&#039;s blatantly full of scammers.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Did you notice how much it was for EU shipping, and is she vac sealed?

I know it&#039;s not a very popular view to feel sorry for those guys, but it does no good to hate anyone for something they would never have wanted to get into in the first place if they knew what amazement, beauty and joy is possible if they opted not to.. They must just be so fucked in the mind that they keep going further.&nbsp; The horror in one person&#039;s life must&#039;ve started pretty early for them to come to the point of spreading child porn and hatred, and wanting someone dead bad enough to pay someone else to make it happen... I hope the misguided can heal.. or at least quit spreading filth.&nbsp; Tor is used for some of the best and worst purposes imho.
