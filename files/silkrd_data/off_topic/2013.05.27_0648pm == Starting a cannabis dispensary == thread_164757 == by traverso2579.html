				Hope your days goin well :)<br />I have a very serious passion for cannabis an its medicinal uses. I have been trading commodities independently for the past 3.5 years but trading isn&#039;t my passion and I would LOVE to start a compassionate dispensary somewhere &quot;legal&quot;. I realize I would most likely have to start off trimming / budtending / anything i could in order to build some contacts in the local industry before starting my own delivery service or end goal a brick and mortar shopfront.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would really appreciate ANY info / suggestions into<br /><br />1. What Area would be conducive to start a delivery service / storefront dispensary.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**This is what i am finding to be the hardest. Since i have no family or connections out west its very hard for me to judge what area would be best for me to relocate to**<br /><br />2. How to get my foot in the door of the industry<br /><br />3. Any classes you attended or have heard were beneficial<br /><br />4. Anything you believe would be helpful to someone just starting off in the industry with an end goal of starting their own storefront<br /><br />Thanks for your time :) much love and appreciation

				Contact a professional medical cannabis lawyer in the state that you want to open it in.&nbsp; You could attend Oaksterdam University.&nbsp; Prepare to get raided by the DEA.<br /><br />It is federally illegal.&nbsp; No state law technically allows the sale of medical cannabis.&nbsp; You arn&#039;t legally allowed to turn a profit according to state law.&nbsp; You are allowed to receive money to pay for the utilities and bills pertaining to the growing or dispensing of medical cannabis, no profit though.&nbsp; They are very lax on the state laws about not turning a profit though.&nbsp; DEA isn&#039;t lax.&nbsp; According to federal law, you are a drug trafficker and they can seize all of your assets and throw you in prison.&nbsp; You will need a professional medical cannabis lawyer on retainer for if/when you get raided and/or audited.

				I had this passion a few years ago. Its still one of my life goals, just not currently possible to accomplish. I actually took classes and &quot;graduated&quot; from Oaksterdam University, lol. It was very eye-opening to attend those lectures. Learned a lot about how to get into a canna-business. <br /><br />OP, this dream requires either lots of money or lots of patience. Also, I think the golden days in California have passed. If you wanted to do this I&#039;d suggest exploring some of the new MMJ states since they will also be new to the process. Rhode Island and Washington DC for example are looking to license responsible people to run dispensaries in their area. <br /><br />If this is a serious dream of yours be prepared for a lot of work and perseverance. I know it sounds awesome to say &quot;yeah I work in/own a dispensary&quot; but there really is a huge amount of work that goes into doing it properly.
