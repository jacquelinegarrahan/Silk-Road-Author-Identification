				So hopefully people feel the sarcasm off the topic tittle :p<br /><br />But damn, Like I leave for a few days and come back and theres like 5 or more extra negitive karma points without me even posting :/<br /><br />I say what I feel and I guess if you don&#039;t like it NEG KARMA ME! But damn, I&#039;m here to help people,review vendors, and post some stupid shit. Sounds like the regular forumer haha. But I should stop ranting and get to the point. <br /><br />The people with high neg karma, what&#039;s up!? haha... I think since we have high neg karma we all should be friends for sure haha&nbsp; ::) Negatives do turn into positive :)<br /><br />But what did you say that you think got you all these neg karma? I know it was my junkie speech in the H forum. Kind of stupid and hypicritical since I was pretty much one at that point. But I was wding and getting scammed which made me get a little angry. <br /><br />But Now I&#039;m doing what I do and I still get constant neg karma haha. Woot woot. I hope people don&#039;t care as much as me cause this shouldn&#039;t make me a bad person in peoples eyes. <br /><br />Fin.<br /><br />PB

				I don&#039;t believe most people actually understand the proper use of neg/pos karma points. <br /><br />If someones bein a dick, then sure, neg karma them... but just because you disagree with something someone has an opinion about, that doesn&#039;t mean you automatically givem neg karma point. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m fairly new here, but have been on a couple of other drug forums for years. (drugbuyers etc, not tor stuff) Saved me a lot of trouble here because I have learned how important it is to read the forums before you make any decisions and also how to tell when a place was going pearshaped. I have had only good experiences here, I always leave a 5 because so far no one has deserved any less. Everything is cool here, I have less than 30 posts, but have managed to rack up 6 or maybe more negatives so far. Honestly, it makes me smile when I see them. I know some people just enjoy handing them out and if it makes them happy, then I am serving some purpose here.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if they hurt my cred in some way, but I don&#039;t care, but I do think that some people are also giving them unfairly to dealers and that could affect their business. On other forums, if you click on helpful or whatever other choices there are, your id shows as well. I think the same should happen here. Most people seem to know who is leaving them negatives, so why not have it out in the open. (expecting more negatives if you guys really care about my post)&nbsp; :P
