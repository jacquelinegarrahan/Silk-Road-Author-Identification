				I’m kind of the goto go amongst my friends for sourcing drugs, I have lots of good contacts IRL as well as having silk road at my disposal. Recently a friend of a friend who I had been getting abit of hash for asked me about getting xanax. Lucky for him one of my contacts came into a large amount of out of date xanax for dirt cheap so over the past few weeks i’ve been selling quite a lot of theses to this guy. <br /><br />So anyway yesterday we were at a party and he was pretty drunk and he asked me for another large amount of xanax. I said yeah no probs but then I asked him about how many of these he was taking and whether he knew how physically addictive they are. He said that he does and has been through benzo addiction before, been to NA for them etc etc.<br /><br />This has me a little worried, I don’t want to be a judgmental wanker and cut off his supply but I also don’t want to be the reason he develops a full blown benzo addiction!<br /><br />What should I do?&nbsp; Should I just sell him small amounts sporadically from now on or should I just stop selling them to him altogether.

				I used to dabble in helping my friends out with stuff like this, but I never dabled in quantities which I knew would mess people up if they were really hooked.<br /><br />I know some dealers really don&#039;t care how hooked someone is (more money for them), but you&#039;re obviously not cut throat and actually HAVE morals.<br /><br />So I would suggest doing whatever your gut tells you to do.<br /><br />One suggestion is to just give the guy less, and not give him more until a certain time period has elapsed (say, a month). <br /><br />And at the first sign of him fiending, cut him off. <br /><br />End of the day, you don&#039;t want his addiction on your conscience.

				You should sell him more! Customer for life dude.. Well his life anyway. See if you can turn him into a proper fiend, try selling him gel caps full of heroin.. tell him they&#039;re &quot;new stronger benzos&quot; when he´s good and hooked get him to turn tricks for you behind seedy truck stops for 5$ a go. It´s an earner, I envy you<br /><br />Lol I jest btw. Never sell to anyone that is especially at risk of harm dude! think about how guilty you would feel if something happened to the guy. Don´t cut off his supply cause he´ll just find someone else.. keep him coming to you but small amounts just to keep him going, make up excuses as to why you cant get the rest.

				Just be a man about it, set boundaries in your dealing. You&#039;re not responsible for him fucking up. But if it sways out of the comfort zone, then tell him you&#039;re out of shit for a while...might get some more again in a few weeks.<br /><br />In my mind it would only become a moral issue, if that person started fucking up other peoples lives as a consequence. <br /><br />But if its just to himself, and hes been down that road before, then ehhh. There usually a bigger deeper pyschological problem at play than the drugs, that&#039;s not something that will be solved as a result of the drug supply being cut off. But who knows, it might help.

				Tell him you dont have very reliable supply anymore and just sell him a little bit for a while and then tell him you cant get them anymore.

				It&#039;s very nice to see you concerned about the welfare of your friend.&nbsp; I was actually selling Xanax to a guy who wasn&#039;t even really my friend, and he admitted he had an addictive personality.&nbsp; He was taking way too many stims and using Xanax to sleep.&nbsp; The amount of times he would ask me for more Xanax started to make me uncomfortable, so I began to just lie to him and say I was out.&nbsp; I definitely think you should only sell this dude small amounts, or tell him you&#039;re out every once in a while even when you&#039;re not.&nbsp; If he was previously addicted to Xanax, he probably shouldn&#039;t be taking it in the first place, but that is his decision.&nbsp; It is, however, up to you how much you are willing to sell to an addict.

He sounds like he has an addictive personality and is irresponsible of his actions, almost as if he is in denial of his choices. If your a friend of his, be a good one, keep him controlled, give him enough, but not too much. I feel for your situation and wish you and your friend all the best.
