				Well its an excuse for a party and seeing that in about 6 hours IRL pressures will be alot less than they are now im looking forward to it as far as that is concerned.<br /><br />However as a general principle im not a fan of the monarchy. They don&#039;t have any real power (in theory they do but it could never be enforced as they would just be abolished) so i don&#039;t object to them their, its more the cost to the state i object to.<br /><br />But yea big excuse for a piss up, suits me =)

				Tbh the best thing about the jubilee is the street parties/utter go mental mentality people seem to adopt. <br /><br />Plus it&#039;s one of those occasions, like when England win at football, where people aren&#039;t cunts to each other, and there&#039;s good will all round. That&#039;s the best part of it for me. <br /><br />Personally I&#039;m gonna be banging out lines of m1 and then dropping a 0.2 sample of drNyx&#039;s mdma, before macking on some chicks and making a fool of myself.

				Just caught the news report about the queens jubilee. Looks like a good time was had by all. Some big names performing too. Annie lenox sounded like shit from the little bit that i heard her sing, but Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder sounded good. Not a big Elton John fan, but thats still a pretty damn impressive playlist. <br /><br />So that diamond is the real deal, huh? Anyone know whats its value is? Tell the queen ill give her 150BTC for it, lol.<br /><br />+ Oh yea ill teach her PGP encryption for free too.

				You can tell how special their genes are.
