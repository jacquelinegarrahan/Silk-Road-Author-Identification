				Such short memories some people have.<br />You know bitcoin has been below $20 for the vast majority of it&#039;s life, right? <br />Easy come, easy go.<br />(btw I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll return $20, just trying to provide a frame of reference)

				Yea lot of stuff happening today, SR still down, this Coinlab suing Mt.Gox crap, just kind of a bad bitcoin day. <br /><br />We&#039;ll see what happens in the new few days/weeks, I wonder if the bitcoin luster is beginning to wear off from the spike and return to a little above two months ago.&nbsp; Seems like a lot are selling off, at the same time it has kicked back to 94.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much at all in bitcoin but I would be nervous if I did, this is too volatile and a lot are getting burned trying to make a quick buck.

				I got lots in.

You really have to have he funds to leave there for months at a time with out touching it.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I keep coins in separate wallets based on the price I bought them at.&nbsp; So, I only spend from those wallets when the price is well above the price I bought them.&nbsp; You can&#039;t mix them up or you&#039;ll spend them at the wrong times <br /><br /><br />I really hope they go back to 160.+

				I don&#039;t know why you&#039;re keeping so many bitcoins for so long that you&#039;re actually losing a significant amount of money. I guess if you&#039;re a vendor, it makes sense. Probably takes time to get rid of it and a lot is coming in.

				Personally I do not see the price staying lower than 100 USD in the long term.<br /><br />Either that or it goes back to 10-30 a coin<br />
