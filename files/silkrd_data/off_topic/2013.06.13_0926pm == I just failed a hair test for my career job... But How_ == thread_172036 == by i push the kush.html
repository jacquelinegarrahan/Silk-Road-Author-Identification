				So this is the story, I tested positive for MDMA in my hair... But I have not used MDMA in months... like 7 or 8 months and I am 2000% positive about that. Anyways my boss calls me into his office and he says &quot;have you been taking any prescriptions lately?&quot; (MDMA is not a prescription lol) I said&quot;no&quot; then he said &quot;why don&#039;t you just be straight up with me&quot; and I said &quot; I haven&#039;t taken anything besides the Vicodin I was prescribed for my wisdom teeth&quot; then he says &quot;well it says here you tested positive for MDMA, known on the streets as ecstasy, I don&#039;t know why people have to use this stuff, some kind of high I guess&quot; Then he fired me and told me good luck on my job search. I am fucking PISSED cuz I don&#039;t even like doing molly cuz I get all emotional and I always have bad thoughts on it, and the last time I took it was in October or November of 2012! But is it possible that it soaked in my skin from me touching it? Because I have touched it a lot recently? My mind is just boggled right now cuz it says online that a hair test goes back 90 days.

				My hair is 1 inch long at the moment and was also 1 inch before the hair test. I got it cut the day before the hair test and I&#039;ve also had it cut 2 or 3 times while I have been working there for months staying clean.

				That&#039;s strange.<br /><br />You did not take any other medication? It might be as silly as a tablet against a running nose that contains a legal amphetamine...<br /><br />I doubt just handling the product will show it in your hair; except maybe when you lick your fingers afterwards haha<br />

So it is unlikely to aCan you elaborate on &quot;touched it a lot recently&quot;? Was it in crystal or powder form, were you wearing a face mask, were you wearing gloves, etc.. It might be that the MDMA got onto your fingers, absorbed into the oils, then passed through into your blood stream. Or you may have inhaled enough over time to cause a positive reading. Or possibly there was just some in your hair but if you got it cut recently and bathe semi-regularly, this is unlikely..

				Nobody here knows that any drug will stay in your hair for ever if not cut? That is the case here obviously. u didnt cut enough to completely hide all activities.<br /><br />It is like a tree showing its age with the rings inside it. Its not only showing its age but a lot of different things like weather specific things and such. Your hair tells a similar story. if you now cut ur hair completely u will not fail a test anymore after , im positive. But what u actually have there is still some mdma in ur hair i guess :P

				You should have demanded another one, not only can drug tests report false positives, but they can also be mixed up. There are just so many variables to use in your advantage to get another test. It sounds like you just stood there and took it up the ass.

				I don&#039;t understand why this is surprising. You&#039;ve been handling large amounts of mdma. Of course some will be absorbed through your skin. Some of these drug tests have very high sensitivity. It&#039;s not a false positive at all -- it&#039;s just more sensitive than you might&#039;ve hoped if it&#039;s detecting sub-physiological doses.<br /><br />And smelling IS ingesting. What do you think the receptors in your nose respond to?<br /><br />Looks like you got fucked by very sensitive test. And that sucks.
