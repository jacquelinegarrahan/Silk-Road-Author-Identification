				Nope. It&#039;s marijuana...not body parts :P Just looking to get cheeched up while down here. It&#039;s not like I asked on facebook or something...I did not give an address or anything..just was looking for a kind soul, not a smug fuck. <br /><br />I assumed I would get a response like that. However...if you do not ask, you won&#039;t know. Only gonna be down here for another day or so anyway. Down here and a mother fuckers out, and thought I would see what I could fish up. <br /><br />Asking here is safer than me asking around the damn island you screwball.
