				I got a bunch of RCs from Silk Road that I&#039;m going to try out eventually. My plan is to space out the uses of each a week or 2. Been researching them on Erowid. Just wanted to find out if anyone had a opinion of what to try first.

				From my experience from 3 of the four you&#039;ve listed 5-MeO-DiPT was the most unique! I think that is the best one because it&#039;s positive effects outweigh the negative effects and the high is definitely worth any effects that come with it!<br /><br />Just don&#039;t OD!!!!

				I didn&#039;t vote since I haven&#039;t done any of those enough to be able to form a truly well informed opinion, but I&#039;ve had fun with some RCs in the past, 5-MeO-DiPT was a good one so I suppose I could have voted for that.&nbsp; Make sure you have a scale that measures micrograms or that you know what you&#039;re doing, don&#039;t eyeball amounts when it comes to RCs.&nbsp; It is much easier to OD and die on these things than a lot of the common street drugs, and the last thing SR needs is media attention from people dying of overdoses from using rare designer drugs aka RCs or someone going on a rampage in a fit of insanity brought on by taking too much bizarre psychoactive chemicals.&nbsp; The dosages you take are in milligrams or micrograms depending on the chemical, so it&#039;s very easy to go way overboard with the dose if you just eyeball it.&nbsp; Here&#039;s an erowid style trip report, a bad one, from myself, that relates very much to what I&#039;m saying :<br /><br />I had a really scary trip when I stayed with a friend at his cabin in Canada years ago and he wanted to do some acid and RCs and just generally party hard.&nbsp; Despite my warnings he just eyeballed the stuff, I don&#039;t recall what RC it was because it was years ago when these things were legal, but an hour or two after ingestion he was so fucked up in a bad way it made me freak out because I thought he was going to die or try to kill me.&nbsp; He was getting all up in my face yelling crazy shit and gibberish, really furious, and throwing things around in his cabin, wild mood swings and he even broke the TV and fired a loaded shotgun he had under his bed at a Jimi Hendrix poster and then laughed like a maniac spinning around on the floor having pissed himself literally.<br /><br />While he was tossing some random possessions around I snuck outside for a moment just to hide the shotgun under some foliage, although he didn&#039;t look for it or notice it was no longer where he dropped it after firing it.&nbsp; One second he would be hugging me a little too intimately saying how much he appreciates me as a friend and he loves me and how much of a great guy I am, then within seconds he&#039;d flip and start saying what a piece of shit I am and how he&#039;s going to kill me if I stand up from the couch or make any sudden moves.&nbsp; Other people were supposed to come too, I was first to get there but of course when the shit started hitting the fan I went out for a cigarette and phoned them to tell them not to come and gave some excuse as to why, I didn&#039;t tell them the whole truth LOL.<br /><br />Only reason I even stayed was because A) the guy was a good long term friend and B) I felt a responsibility to society to make sure he didn&#039;t harm himself or others.&nbsp; The whole time I was just kind of trying to calm him down, although I myself was tripping too albeit at a FAR lower dose.&nbsp; My trip would have been extremely pleasant if I wouldn&#039;t have had to babysit him the entire time and make sure he doesn&#039;t leave the cabin to go get himself arrested or worse.<br /><br />Moral of the story : Never underestimate RC&#039;s, they are interesting and fun at low doses, but can turn you into an outright psycho or kill you if you do too much.&nbsp; Not something to give to irresponsible druggies.

				Thanks for the advice rowsdower, I intend to stick with low doses, and I will have a healthy respect for the drugs. I&#039;ll try not to be a &#039;irresponsible druggie&#039;. I shall take my drugs responsibly and with caution. No joke.

I&#039;d give you karma if I knew how, I&#039;m kind of a noob here.&nbsp; :-[&nbsp; Perhaps I&#039;m not allowed to contribute it yet? <br /><br />PS&gt; I just noticed your profile signature/motto, it&#039;s hilarious.&nbsp; That&#039;s exactly how I felt many years ago when I started drinking from time to time and smoking weed.

				Whoops, forgot about this thread, thanks for voting, I&#039;m doing the DIPT. Probably try it around the weekend, and I hope I don&#039;t have running diarrhea with nausea lol. That&#039;s some of the negatives listed on erowid.
