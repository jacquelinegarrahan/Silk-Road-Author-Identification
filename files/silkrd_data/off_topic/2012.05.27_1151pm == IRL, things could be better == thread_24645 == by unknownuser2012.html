However, the best thing about rehab was the dope connections I made. There was this Mexican dealer that I hooked with who had the best china white I ever tasted. Unfortunately, I had to move out of so. cal. and go to Seattle so I could stay clean. The thing I got out of this though was if you want to hook up with the right people rehab is the place to do it. It&#039;s unlikely (at least then) that LE is going through rehab. A good dope fiend can spot/validate another (legitimate) dope fiend quite easily. Good luck to any LE that tries to fake it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know what your saying man. No jokes from me about it. I spent some time in the hole and I learned a lot and made a lot of new friends. I know the same is true about rehab. My time spent was made into a positve thing for me. I learned a lot of different ways to cook up some dope. I left there with a whole new phone book. I still talk to quite a few of them to this day. Some didn&#039;t get out til after I was out for years but they hit me up as soon as they got out. Those guys turned out to be some of the most trusted friends that I have ever had.
