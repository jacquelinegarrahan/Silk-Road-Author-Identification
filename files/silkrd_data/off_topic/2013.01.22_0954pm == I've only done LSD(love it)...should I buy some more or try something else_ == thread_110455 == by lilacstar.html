				This is basically a help me decide what to buy thread.<br /><br />The only drug I have ever taken is LSD. I have tripped on it 3 times in my life and it is literally the most awesome thing ever. I&#039;m almost addicted to the visuals and the creative thoughts it gives me. But I&#039;m curious about shrooms and pot as well.<br /><br />Should I purchase some shrooms, some edibles, or just get what I know I love, LSD?<br /><br />Am I missing out if I don&#039;t take shrooms or edibles? I&#039;ve never been &quot;high&quot; before which is crazy when I think about it, and I feel like it is something I should experience. Shrooms also sound awesome but I heard it can cause quite a bit of nausea and can be a more intense version of LSD.<br /><br />I&#039;m asking because I only have enough money to purchase a good amount of one of these items. Which should I get?

				i&#039;d go with the shrooms over the edibles at least for me edibles don&#039;t really do too much for me and yeah the come up on the shrooms is gonna be rough just make sure you hold it in as for edibles just get some pot instead and smoke it either way its your call bro lsd is fun too you can&#039;t really go wrong with whatever you order

				You should try some MDMA dude, I would recommend everyone to try it at least once in their lives. Not very psychedelic as such (no visuals unless you heroic dose) but an incredible substance none the less. Do some research on it and have a think about it. :)

				i agree with all of the above. you can&#039;t really go wrong there. but if you&#039;re looking for something new, i&#039;d definitely have to recommend mushrooms. similar to lsd in some ways, but in essence a much different experience than lsd. after suffering from a chronic illness for 10 years, one particularly strong psilocybin trip finally made healing a possibility for me. it has changed my life, to say the least!

				Personally fuck shrooms....some people like em...but yuck...they taste terrible and make your stomach feel shitty...<br /><br />if u enjoy LSD stick with LSD IMO...it is WAAAAAAAY better than shrooms...but if you want my REAL suggestion then.....<br /><br /><br />DMT... changa was what i started with and it was amazing...its kinda expensive but if you can get some pure DMT then id say go for that...LSD doesn&#039;t hold a candle to its intensity...well maybe at like 800ug+ lsd starts to become like this...but DMT is so spiritual and visually amazing that i suggest it to any psyconaught.<br />

				I highly recommend MDA not MDMA. MDA is psychedelic if you take a proper dose. It gives you amazing syntheasia (spelling?) where music and sounds show up as colors and shapes in your mind. You can literally SEE the music. All the while you&#039;re body feels amazing dumping out your seritonin/dopeamine so that the next day you don&#039;t feel so good :P not any worse than a hang over though! And yes, I sell shrooms, they are fantastic in their own way :)

				hm.... if I were you, I&#039;d buy a sample of shrooms, and then use the rest of your coins to buy more acid. Shrooms are pretty amazing. i prefer acid myself, but i like to have shrooms and peyote around for some variety every now and then.<br /><br />btw You should probably smoke weed before trying edibles... Edibles can be very intense for someone who is not used to marijuana. the first time i tried marijuana, it was an edible, and i had a panic attack... even though I had a lot of previous experience with LSD and shrooms. Quite embarrassing

				Panic attacks on weed are far more common than one would think.. people just don&#039;t like to talk about it, but half the people I know IRL have had panic attacks smoking weed at least once.

				If you go the MDMA route I&#039;ll just toss out there that there are two distinctive ways of enjoying it. The most common is to go out, party, dance, make new friends, hug everyone. The other is my personal favorite, stay at home, drop it with your girl / boy and sit around for a few hours kissing and talking about how awesome everything is and how much you love each other. <br /><br />Both are fun but it&#039;s like a different drug when you are snuggled up next to someone vs. hitting the party scene. <br /><br />Nothing wrong with going with what you know and just getting some more LSD but if you end up enjoying the MDMA it&#039;s even more fun on LSD... they just play so nice together.

				shrooms. they don&#039;t taste bad really, to me at least, and they&#039;re natural, but lsd is good too. I second dmt it puts you in another dimension

				Depends on how adventurous you are feeling.<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t feeling very adventurous, go ahead and stick with what you know and love.
