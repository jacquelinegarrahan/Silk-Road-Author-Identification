				Hey, <br />I am writing here about Ketamine expressly, but I am interested to hear about the experience of any drug that literally teleports you to another dimension.<br /><br />Ok so I have always been so interested to know what others experience in their K-Holes, none of my IRL friends can describe it with any degree of certainty, so I turn to you, being far more literate and intelligent. I know what my K-Holes are like, they all follow a descernable pattern, They all enter and exit with the same kind of fluidity. I always merge what is going on around me IRL into my K-Hole to a certain extent. <br />I know this is very private stuff, but I find it oh so fucking fascinating. I really want to know if there is any similarities between what people see / experience in there, I want to know if outside stimuli affects your experience. <br /><br />Ok so I will start! <br /><br />As soon as I snort that line reality breaks away, it does this by either melting or fragmenting. That is to say, If you imagine what I can see IRL as being an image on a screen, the screen either literally breaks into pieces, shatters like glass, the fragments fall away and behind it lies a new world. The other entry I always seem to have is melting, If we take the screen analogy again, the screen just drips down quickly and I am looking at something other than the room I was in previously.. <br /><br />My K holes always have an element of travel in them, not in the journey sense but more in the rollercoaster or free fall sense. I feel like I am traveling extremely quickly and here is where outside stimulus seems to affect my experience, If someone says something to me, or hands me something, It is re-interpreted by my brain and appears in my K hole. an example would be, if someone holds a cigarette up to my face and says do you want to smoke, My roller coaster as it were will pass through a massive smoke cloud and i might see a giant cigarette below me or something. There is always an element of death there as well , I don´t know why, but it always feels a bit like im gonna die, or I am dead, like its the passage to the afterlife or something, I dont know why because I don´t believe in life after death and I am not particularly scared of death either. As I slowly come back to reality I always get the sense that I have been gone ages. It´s kind of a relief to make sense of the world again and to see things slowly fall into place. And that is exactly what happens, things literally fall into place. Like the seat I was sitting on that before might have been like a giant bench on a gallion, turns back into the sofa, the tv randomly appears etc... <br /><br />Share your thoughts!!!

				Nice descriptions Ace! Never k-holed before, so it&#039;s nice to get some idea of what it might be like. I actually have some of each substance on the way, so hopefully in the not to distant future I&#039;ll be able to add my own report.

				Completely agree with you ace on the thoughts of dying during k-hole<br /><br />Though for me it wasn&#039;t that I thought I was gonna die, it was more like &quot;I could die right now.&quot; It did not panic me the slightest however; the thought was just there. then my rational somehow kicked in as I remembered how high the toxic dose of ketamine is. <br /><br />Ketamine is a really emotionally devoid drug, for me at least. My whole trip almost seems mechanical at parts, not to say they are not breathetaking and extremely enjoyable. Just can never really put my finger on if my journeys are happy or sad; neither seems to be the case. I tend to travel through different scenes, these hallucinations are not anything like patterns or other serotonin-working drug effects, but are more like I am gliding through different scenes, such as a flying over a river in a deep canyon and finally going into the river to find myself in the similarly blue colored sky, falling into some other scene...

				Personally I prefer doing up ketamine. It takes you through the k-hole and into k-land!!<br /><br />Half a gram of A+ grade at once, and you are gently placed into a land of shifting geometric vortexes while enjoying a stroll through alien market places that line a long linear patterned hallway fading of into the horizon, as caricatures of characters from H R Pufnstuf try to cajole you into seeking hidden treasure.... then suddenly you arrive back on Earth and realize you&#039;ve been sitting on the floor in the same position the entire time.<br /><br />Just be sure that if you do decide to IV, get a friend to do the administering, as their is barely enough time to pull the needle out before Lando arrives to pick you up in his cloud car ::)

				for me, no psychedelic comes close to the awe-inspiring, transdimensional trip dmt provides. it is one of the most intense experiences you can possibly have and survive. it&#039;s life-changing and deeply spiritual to me, like a gateway to the astral plane.

				K-hole all the way baby.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the boilerplate experience of my few hundred k-holes.<br /><br />Lying in a dark room. The first indication of the k-state is that I feel myself moving like on a conveyor belt, smoothly sliding in the direction of my feet. Then I start dropping downwards and the darkness opens up into a sort of infinite expanse. That&#039;s a consistent k feature for me - a three-dimensionality to the darkness and then the hallucinations. I often have the experience of traveling through some sort of inter-dimensional pipes, with the definite revelation that this is a deeper more concealed level of reality that underpins our day-to-day reality. The pipes allow traversing space-time much like worm-holes.<br /><br />A common experience was floating through a city-scape or alien landscape. I could often quite clearly see buildings and superstructure. I have more than once drifted through upper floors of seemingly occupied apartment complexes -- right past people watching tv in their apartments -- in some urban center (NY? HK? I lean towards NYC but was never able to identify any landmarks for certain during those experiences)<br /><br />One of the great things about the k-hole is it&#039;s very consistent. Not 100%, but there is a degree of reproducibility to the experience. I agree that&#039;s its very emotion-less. I value that. It&#039;s the most intellectually intriguing drug I&#039;ve ever tried.<br /><br />At first I used to insufflate, but the sinus pain/drip I found too distracting after a while. IM is way preferable and more accurate for dosing.<br /><br />It always felt like there was an objective reality to the experience. That this was in fact a hidden layer of reality that we could access with K. Add in the fact that 90% of the k-hole memory evaporates like a dream upon come down and it becomes a very seductive experience that needs to always be tried one more time. So many nights we stayed up holing out with 1cc 2cc and then 3cc (twofers and threefers we&#039;d call them) IM injections, always certain we were just on the edge of retaining that hidden knowledge...<br /><br />It was never to be. Eventually we burned ourselves out on K. I&#039;d remember less and less of the hole. While in the beginning I&#039;d remain immobile during the hole, towards the end I&#039;d get up, somnambulant, knocking over furniture and getting belligerent or infantile. Things get weird with over-use of dissociatives. Then I started getting severe cardiac effects and that was the end. Nothing left for me. We sucked the marrow out of it and never found what we were looking for.<br /><br />Good memories of me and my friends trials there (and some bad -- more than one of us woke up in the hospital).<br />Been about 8 years now for me. Who knows, maybe if I wait long enough some magic might return...<br /><br />Anyway DMT to me is all sparkly lights and colors and no insight. It&#039;s a buzzing confusion. Like getting hit in the head with a magical shovel. YMMV.

				Hopefully it&#039;s OK to cross post my trip report of rogerpete(deemtea)&#039;s DMT here. I&#039;d like to join in the conversation. :) I have some Ket on the way, and am looking forward to experiencing this whole &#039;k-hole&#039; thing, but this DMT trip was fucking fantastic. Sensory reality became a psychedelic fun house, and I was lifted up to the gateway leading to the realm of the mechanical elves. It had been a while since I&#039;d been in their neck of the woods, and they seemed happy to see me again. :D<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ideally I would have had a nice piece to vap with, like a GVG. Little about my life is ideal though, so I used the sandwich method via my bong. I weighed out about 30 mg, added a layer of bud to my bowl, sprinkled the DMT onto that, and then covered it with another layer of bud. Without giving away any specific details about my casa, I have a big balcony with a great, up close view of skyscrapers on one side, and about 90 miles of &quot;open&quot; space trailing off into the distance on the other side. Even though it was 5 am, I didn&#039;t want to take my bong out on the balcony, so instead I opened the sliding doors wide open and sat just inside, excited to see how DMT would augment this already incredible view.<br /><br />With bong in hand, I lightly roasted the top of layer of bud, and took a rather unassuming first hit. I noticed the effect right away, but the hit was small enough that I still fully had my wits about me, and was able to take a larger second hit. I held the smoke in for a few seconds, before exhaling it out of my nose, during which time I set the bong down to get ready to take off.<br /><br />As it turned out, those first two hits consumed maybe half the 30 mg, as I was able to get another great experience by cashing the bowl about an hour later. So what follows is a trip report of ~15-20 mg of rogerpete&#039;s DMT, smoked via the sandwich method out of a bong.<br /><br />I concentrate on setting down the bong, and am pleased that I manage just fine. There will be no nasty bong water to clean up once I return to my senses. I look up to appreciate the view, to see that the buildings have taken on a friendly, vivid colorfulness--the dim morning light has transferred deep blues and purples to the scene, and the DMT has heightened the effect. As I look on, for some reason the railing of my balcony draws my attention. As I continue to stare, it&#039;s drab, concrete, utilitarian appearance falls away, and is replaced by an ineffably beautiful facade of gold a red bands of color, which seem to expand and contract based upon my will. Physical reality has taken on the appearance of a mad, psychedelic fun house, unreal colors, wonky perspectives, and in general the feeling that my brain is processing my senses VERY differently from normal. &quot;Oh right!&quot; I think, &quot;I just smoked DMT!&quot;<br /><br />At this point a few minutes have passed. I realize that, because of my method of intake and the relatively low dose, I&#039;m not so much riding a rocket ship as sitting on a giant hand, metaphorically speaking, that is lifting me up past the conventional plane of the senses into DMT headspace. Feeling like I might soon reach an elevation that would require me to lay down, I manage to pull my attention away from the most beautiful of balcony railings (the baroque and ornate furniture in some place like Buckingham Palace have got nothing on what I was seeing), and I walk out onto my balcony to fully immerse myself in the view. The buildings look fascinating, they&#039;re gigantic, inanimate objects, but right now they seem to be dancing to the music of the universe; they remind me of personified objects in old Disney cartoons. But my breath is really taken when I turn to the large expanse on my right. It&#039;s not so much that my normal view has been replaced, but instead it&#039;s like the view of the foreground is repeating itself into the distance, like I&#039;m looking into the type of fun house mirror that repeats mirror images into infinity. I find this visual effect absolutely fascinating, and I stay entranced as long as I can.<br /><br />My sojourn onto the balcony lasts for probably 5 minutes. There&#039;s no fear or anxiety, I&#039;m actually very calm. But the effects are still increasing. I had put on some mellow indie rock, Rogue Wave, Benjamin Gibbard, mild stuff like that. When I step back inside, I become away of how the DMT is affecting my auditory processing. I know this music consists mainly of acoustic guitars, some electric, but it&#039;s a pretty simple, analog sound. But to my ears I&#039;m listening to some very strange electronica. Via my DMT-infused brain, I&#039;m hearing what sounds like a heavily processed, simple and repetitive synthesizer bass line. I remember thinking, &quot;How did this get added to my playlist?&quot;&nbsp; ??? Then a thought floats gentle into my awareness, &quot;Oh ya, mechanical elves.&quot;&nbsp; :D<br /><br />I probably stood there for 3-4 minutes, listening to this strange music, thinking about important things in my life like my own happiness and how well I take care of myself on a daily basis (both things I want to improve on), reflecting on how easy it should be to leap over old, outmoded patterns of behavior, in general some very life affirming and positive topics. It was during this time that I managed to appreciate how powerful, yet gentle, this DMT experience had so far been. While intense, I felt safe throughout, and I was very thankful for this. During this time, gentle reminders regarding &quot;mechanical elves&quot; kept floating up to consciousness, and I finally felt obliged to lay down and give the idea my full attention.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m laying down on my bed, and I let myself relax into the sensation of being transported to the land of the mechanical elves. They&#039;re dancing and singing, which seems to be all they really care to do, in my experience. But they&#039;re friendly, mischievous, but good-natured. They beckon my to join them. I think of my normal state of consciousness as an accordion, the DMT has stretched it far enough that I can see the open spaces between the folds of the bellow, and this is where the mechanical elves live. I recognize that the small-ish dose, and less than ideal smoking method, will keep me from breaking through entirely, so I content myself to enjoying the closeness to these weird &quot;creatures.&quot; I tell them, &quot;You think you&#039;re so mysterious, but I know you&#039;re just the result of my brain grasping at the most workable metaphor it could come up with to try to understand what this tryptamine has done to it.&quot; To which they merrily replied, &quot;Well of course. We don&#039;t take ourselves seriously, why should anyone else?&quot; I thought this was a sage answer.<br /><br />And I laid there probably 10-15 minutes, enjoying the closeness to the ineffable, until I gradually, gentle, returned to my senses. For the next 25-30 minutes everything had a nice, colorful glow. I felt deeply relaxed and content. I reflected that I had somehow managed to give some psychotherapeutic attention to some of my chronic issues of depression and anxiety, and while acid or shrooms tend to leave me with a raw feeling after doing this, this DMT had been gentle, yet possibly more effective (I think the short duration makes this kind of work so much less intense). I felt connected to myself in a subtle way that I sometimes find to be lacking in my life.<br /><br />tl;dr Even using a less than ideal method (sandwich via a bong), and a pretty small dose (~15-20 mg), I tripped hard for 25-30 minutes, and had a great afterglow for another ~30 minutes. This is some very pure and potent DMT, and I will definitely be picking up a gram (so don&#039;t everybody rush out and clean out RP&#039;s stock before I&#039;m able to grab mine!&nbsp; :P )<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				When taking DMT I usually pre dose on K to the point of holing. I find that the dissociative effect of K removes my brain slightly from the DMT experience enabling me to view the whole thing from a different perspective. It is hard to explain but it almost feels like your watching your DMT experience from the 3rd person. I love it personally. Having come back to ground from blastoff the effects of the K are often completely gone. It is strange that DMT seems to sober me up form the K in a huge way.<br />
