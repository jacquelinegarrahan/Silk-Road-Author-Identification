				Walk to an all night garage!<br /><br />Many is the night I walked 4 miles to a garage. Always stopped of on the way back and had a nice joint and drank a can of fizzy drink.<br /><br />Or failing that - get a potato - take a screw driver and piierce downwards halfway through, then put another hole reaching that original hole. Dig out the bowl with a knife - add silver oil (burn it first as&nbsp; it has oils on it or something)<br /><br />If you had hash its easy. A book, a needle and a glass!<br /><br />Phone a friend?<br /><br />Ask random people in the street if they have skins<br /><br />Or carefully take the baccy out of a ciggy and add the weed baccy mix back in,<br /><br />Or make some oil!<br /><br />Best still just send it to me really. I collect weed. Well I collect it for a while but it all gets used for genuine reasons.

				Or like the last poster said a potato... Instead use an apple it really makes it tasty as well.<br />Same thing stick a screwdriver or nail or whatever you have laying around even a pen will work and stick it in the apple to make a hole to suck out of.&nbsp; Then you will have&nbsp; to create a bowl on one end of the shaft you hollowed out using a knife or something.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you can youtube &quot;apple pipe&quot; or &quot;apple bong&quot; and something should come up for better instructions.<br /><br />I hope you get the gist of it, it&#039;s really quite simple.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />StuntBum

Only really need a pencil, or pen, though. Take off the stem, and the top of an apple is a perfect natural bowl, poke the pencil straight down where the stem was, stopping at about halfway through the apple. Poke a 2nd hole from the side of the apple (wherever you want the mouthpiece) to intersect this hole, then a third hole higher than this for a carb. Then poke down the hole for the bowl again to shove the apple bits further down so they don&#039;t block your holes for your carb and mouth piece.<br /><br />+1 for green apples, give more flavor than red.<br /><br />Some boys went to boyscouts and learned how to make a matchbox car, others like myself stayed home and smoked weed and learned how to make pipes out of various household items (toilet paper roll &amp; piece of a soda can anyone?).
