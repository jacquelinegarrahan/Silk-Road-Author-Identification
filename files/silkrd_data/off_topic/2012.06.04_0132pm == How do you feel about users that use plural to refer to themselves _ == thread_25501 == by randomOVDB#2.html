				For me it&#039;s almost as ridiculous as FOAF or SWIM.<br /><br />Every time I see &quot;we&quot; I imagine 4 guys typing on the keyboard, one letter each.<br /><br />As for &quot;we believe, we think, etc&quot; - If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn&#039;t thinking<br /><br />You&#039;re selling drugs on the internet, you&#039;re not Merck&nbsp; :P

				Just to chime in here, drugs-forum is big on SWIM, however in my experience with bluelight it&#039;s only confused noobs using SWIM, then the mods usually tell them off about it!<br /><br />and yes, SWIM is the most annoying thing ever. Sometimes I get a laugh out of people referring to their user selves as exotic animals...but even that gets annoying to read.

				I find the &quot;we&quot; stuff some vendors use to be nonsense as well.&nbsp; I don&#039;t fucking care how many people are working for you - if you find yourself representing your own product, then you&#039;re an individual.&nbsp; Nobody is impressed with the &quot;we&quot; bullshit.&nbsp; Go fuck yourself.<br /><br />&quot;SWIM&quot; drives me up a wall, too.&nbsp; I got it that as the admin of a clearnet forum you can&#039;t openly condone drug use, lest you get your servers taken down, but when you see a mod CORRECTING somebody, that&#039;s lunacy.&nbsp; Swapping &quot;SWIM&quot; for &quot;I&quot; represents absolutely-as-literally-as-you-can-get nothing.
