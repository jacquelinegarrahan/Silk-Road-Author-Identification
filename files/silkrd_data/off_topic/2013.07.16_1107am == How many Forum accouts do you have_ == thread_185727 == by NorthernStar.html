				After something a mod said in another thread today, this question popped into my head. Although it was pointed out its not illegal to have many accounts. There&#039;s no way as Scammerhounddog suggests of subverting, manipulating or even making a minor ding in the grand scheme of things. As surely the mods, know how many accounts have been registered from the same I.P. they must have a right laugh at all the Jekkyl, and Hide s. Ok I have 3 accounts. And 2 of them were set up because somebody seriously pissed me off. But I think it&#039;s nice you can start again if you have a meltdown. (&nbsp; ;) Razorspyne ) which is a very good thing if you ask moi.&nbsp; Thanks be honest please.
