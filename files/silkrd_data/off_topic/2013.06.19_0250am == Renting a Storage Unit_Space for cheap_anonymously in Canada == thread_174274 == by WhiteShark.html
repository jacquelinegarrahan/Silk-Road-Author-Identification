				I currently rent out a self storage unit which facilitates my package and storing needs. I have two units which together allow me to package my product in separate rooms as well as&nbsp; maintain anonymity as monthly payments are in cash. Together both rooms are fairly cheap, costing me just under $300 a month. <br /><br />Starting in September 2013 however, a notice has been posted that cash payments will no longer be accepted and payments will have to be made with a credit card. This, obviously, is a no no for me. In case anything ever happens to me, I clearly do not want a record that I make monthly payments to a storage facility. <br /><br />Currently I am looking for alternatives that are not too costly and will allow me to maintain my anonymity. <br />I am located in Canada. <br /><br />So far the only thing I can think of is renting a basement, but this would be about $600 a month which is a large chunk of my profits as I am a very small time vendor with a fairly small profit margin after all the fees and costs of vending. <br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />

				You should not be doing such things in a storage locker space. Dogs are taken through those periodically (it is way too obvious of a place for a cache of illicit goods). The same goes for the basement (I&#039;m assuming this would be in another person&#039;s house), but even the basement would be a lot safer than what you have been doing.<br /><br />And you are correct, you definitely do not want any records that could be tied back to anything you have been/are/will be doing that is illegal.<br /><br />I would say go with the basement, if you truly want to stay away from home. If you are a vendor doing good business, 600 shouldn&#039;t be too bad of an expense. Consider it overhead, add it to your bulk cost. It shouldn&#039;t hurt you too much. It&#039;s well worth keeping the salary and infinitely worth it to keep the freedom.

				Product is kept well sealed...2 times vacuum and 2 times mylar. Dogs can come no problem, that is not an issue.

				not to be unhelpful with more questions, but i&#039;ve often wondered this (though I deal mainly with the US) I was curious about the requirements for renting storage. Are self storage units in canada regulated? is there a law stating you must provide ID ? or is it just show up and pay ?

				Well it&#039;s my understanding that they now all require ID, unless it is just my storage facility
