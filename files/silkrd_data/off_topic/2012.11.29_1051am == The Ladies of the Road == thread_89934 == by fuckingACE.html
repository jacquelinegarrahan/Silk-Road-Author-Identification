I agree with MyAlterEgo on intake. From my perspective, it&#039;s more about the intimation factor, but also at times being smart enough to get their male friends to buy drugs for them, as they feel safer and more secure this way. There will always be more males than females purchasing drugs, the purchasing side is very much a male orientated world. SilkRoad should give more females a new lease of confidence to purchase from the comfort of their own sofas, they&#039;ll never need to venture into a &#039;dodgy&#039; area to meet a dealer they might feel &#039;intimated&#039; by, well I hope so, it would be great to see more females purchasing drugs for themselves (and perhaps share with their male friends, it would be great to see the tables turned every once in awhile, sharing is caring!) on SilkRoad and contributing to the forums. You go girls! 8)

Just as many girl friends of mine use as guy friends, they just go about getting them in more underhanded ways.<br /><br />I agree with Gary Oak too on girls making good pushers. I used to know this omgwtfhot girl who dealt pot, she had business coming out her ass. Pot buyers/dealers are not like other drug pushers... less danger, I think. (Also, I really really fucking love Gorillaz and your 2D avatar is wonderful)<br /><br /><br /><br />My means of getting drugs differs though.&nbsp; I don&#039;t rely on bfs (I tend to harrass quiet guys without drug connects into dating me) I&#039;ve always relied on my friends with connects. I&#039;d throw them a little extra coin for their troubles too. I guess I&#039;m too intimidated/afraid of being ripped off/small to defend myself/a total pussy to go to real life drug dealers.<br /><br />Now that SR has become a bigger community. I think you&#039;ll be seeing a lot of ladies come out of the woodwork. Don&#039;t believe that trash about us not being smart enough to get on Tor, this is very, very easy stuff.

				ACE, I am 100% sure that there are dudes around here posting as women because in their fucked up little world believe they will get free drugs or favors from vendors.<br />So, what&#039;s up lady-boys?<br /><br />@ Gary<br />100% True from what I&#039;ve seen nobody sells drugs better than women, at least at parties. There was this black dude a while ago selling MDMA and a white chick with the same product at a party.<br />From what I&#039;ve seen the chick was selling ~80% more than the dude. I bought from both and there was no significant difference between their MDMA.<br /><br /><br />

				In this place where we hang around there is no way to tell if someone is a woman, man, LE etc.<br />I could be LE, you could be LE, vendors could be LE so I&#039;m sure there are few lady-boys somewhere hidden. Also I&#039;m sure there are vendors posting as women for marketing purposes.<br />

				See I have this theory: I generalize greatly so I hope that it causes no offense: <br /><br />Girls are amazingly good at being sneaky, because they´re clever, can lie with a smile and with a flutter of eyelashes can get most guys to lower prices. <br /><br />Guys are good at fighting and not being intimidated by words or actions, You hold up a knife to most you had better be ready to use it. If someone tries to intimidate us were more likely to stand our ground even if it means a ruck. I guess there are lots of different guys around, I´ve seen quite a few guys that act more like girls in any situation where there is a remote chance of a confrontation, I don´t think any less of them, I just cant understand how people give up their ground so easily and let them selves be pushed around, ffs wouldn´t you rather go head to head and lose than run away like a rabbit with a firework up its ass. I think fighting is a natural thing, animals do it, people have done it since we started being people, it feels good and it teaches you how to read people and situations. By this i don&#039;t mean what those fucking pussy chavs do in london, 6 on 1 and armed, that&#039;s not fighting that&#039;s called being a pussy, I´m talking about when 2 people have a dispute and neither one feels like sorting it out verbally.... wow really went of on a tangent.. sorry<br /><br />So from this I deduce that girls would be amazing at, <br />prescription fraud, selling drugs that don´t come with the threat of violence or sketchy people, such as lsd and stuff at raves.&nbsp; They would be very good with talking to dealers and stuff at raves, and being flirty when trying to negotiate prices. <br />Guys would be better at, say picking up 50g of Heroin on some council estate. walking around with large quantities of class A´s and street selling in notorious areas. also selling and buying drugs that have a high risk of addiction, i.e getting robbed by a tweek cause hes got no money for todays dose. <br /><br />For that reason I would have assumed that there would be 70% girls and 30% Guys on here, because of the price on the road, I would have thought that girls being intelligent would rationally work out that the cost of the street/sr price difference is worth the safety of not having to meet people on the street, not having to go to dodgy areas etc.. Most of my guy friends mentalities IRL are like why the fuck would I pay 10% or 20% more and wait a week when I can just get in the fucking motor call X drive to Milwall and I can be boshing lines in half an hour. <br /><br />I think it varies a lot from place to place. I used to live in south east london, there are a few sketchy areas around there. <br /><br />ACE<br /><br />Anyone agree?

				It&#039;s very intimidating buying drugs from a guy you don&#039;t know, especially if you&#039;re by yourself.

				To those saying there&#039;s a 50:50 sex ratio in the drug user community - you&#039;re wrong: <br /><br />&quot;In the European Union men are more likely than women to use illicit drugs. <br />Gender differences in patterns of drug use are often considerable and are <br />reflected in the fact that among the clients of drug treatment services the <br />proportion of women is only around 20%.&quot;<br />▪ Link: http://www.csdp.org/research/gender_brochure_final.pdf<br /><br />&quot;In 2010, as in prior years, the rate of current illicit drug use among persons aged 12 or older was higher for males (11.2 percent) than for females (6.8 percent). Males were more likely than females to be current users of several different illicit drugs, including marijuana (9.1 vs. 4.7 percent), nonmedical use of psychotherapeutic drugs (3.0 vs. 2.5 percent), cocaine (0.8 vs. 0.4 percent), and hallucinogens (0.6 vs. 0.3 percent). The 2010 rates for both males and females aged 12 or older were similar to those reported in 2009.&quot; <br />▪ Link: http://www.samhsa.gov/data/nsduh/2k10nsduh/2k10results.htm <br /><br />Outside of anecdotal evidence, I don&#039;t really see a realistic theory that can refute these findings. Men have a greater propensity to take part in risk-taking behaviors. It helps explain why the male incarceration rate is roughly 15 times the female incarceration rate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States), why there&#039;s only about 20 female fortune 500 CEO&#039;s, and why &quot;in 2004, males were almost 10 times more likely than females to commit murder (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_and_crime). I don&#039;t see how drug use would be any different, especially for &quot;hard&quot; drugs and psychedelics. <br /><br />I also disagree with the belief that females are heavily represented on the Silk Road. There&#039;s normally a larger amount of men amongst the early users of a website (where we are now with the Silk Road) and men generally tend to be more tech-oriented than women. The Silk Road attracting large numbers of female users would seemingly go against these trends.

Also, I would argue that some of these numbers aren&#039;t a fair reflection of drug use, seeing as many of the numbers only show drug users that are in treatment or incarcerated for their use. There are many arguments as to why men would be more likely to be arrested/put into treatment than women. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to totally discredit what you&#039;re showing us. I do think there&#039;s a good chance men are a bigger population of the drug using community, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anywhere near the numbers you&#039;re showing, and I think it&#039;s important to subject statistics to the same review we would give any other evidence, and not always readily accept them as irrefutable.<br /><br />Also, I&#039;m pretty certain people here agree with you that women are not heavily represented on the road. :) I&#039;m not sure why you think we&#039;re in disagreement there. What we&#039;re saying (what I was saying, I won&#039;t speak for others) is that it is changing. There are no official numbers to back that claim, however I think it&#039;s readily observable. When I first joined (May of this year), I saw very few regular posting female members. I think many would agree we have more active female forum members now.

I said there are arguments for the case that men are more likely to be put into treatment, to seek out treatment, and to be incarcerated than women. I was not trying to disprove your numbers, I am only saying that there is reason to doubt that they reflect the drug community at large, especially the first one you cited.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I didn&#039;t notice your comment about &quot;these numbers are from the gov&#039;t/legit sources, so youre off base for questioning them&quot; (sorry to paraphrase there)<br /><br />One, I don&#039;t have as much faith as you do in the government to provide unbiased information. Citing the government being involved as a reason to believe the validity of the study... well, not all people would agree there, that&#039;s all I&#039;ll say about that. Secondly, I have no doubt that these numbers ARE actual reflections of what they claim to measure (all my untrust of the gov&#039;t put aside). Again, all I have said is that they don&#039;t seem to reflect the drug community at large, and that it is reasonable to think on a worldwide scale, things are different. Is it possible you don&#039;t get exactly what I&#039;m claiming? Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear, I am at work at it was a rushed post.

However, from what I see from my everyday life, the male to female ratio is 50/50, but according to both your statistics and my findings I do not represent the average. I wonder if the statistics on the forum reflect sales on SilkRoad, and if they would they differ from the consensus of these reports? We&#039;ll never know, but being SilkRoad is an entirely different (and very new) way to purchase drugs from the traditional methods, it would be interesting to see it&#039;s impact, if any, on the male to female purchasing ratio. Females are not heavily represented on the forums, but it&#039;s great to see an increasing female presence, I hope this trend continues.

There are exceptions, guys that have known me for like my whole life. But most guys IRL seem to act really sketchy around me, never say what they actually think.

All of you bringing up your personal experience, especially any that like spending time around girls and drugs, keep in mind that you&#039;re more likely to find girls who do drugs.<br /><br />I lived in a house with a bunch of people for a few months. I moved out, started doing meth (stopped that already), when I talked to the people there again I found out that at least half of them had done meth and many still liked it on occasion.<br /><br />What you do really skews the slice of society you tend to encounter.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />Exactly. We&#039;re not talking about specific demographics here, we&#039;re talking about two EXTREMELY large and diverse groups. So while, as one of my sources stated, the percentage of males that do drugs regularly is 11.2% vs. 6.8% for females, it doesn&#039;t tell the whole story. There&#039;s still 6.8% of the female population that does drugs regularly, and 88.8% of males who don&#039;t. Nobody&#039;s drawing a line in the sand and claiming that being either male or female defines who you are, it&#039;s just another variable to consider.<br /><br />If many of you ladies here find yourself around an evenly male/female mixed crowd of drug users, it&#039;s probably because your group of friends have personalities that accept this behavior. For better or worse though, more males seem to have this type of personality. <br /><br />To shitwassocash: my apologies if I appeared condescending and I agree with you that government studies are not going to be free of bias or miscalculations. They are however, by far the most scientific and thorough reports we have on this issue, and to dismiss them outright because of your preconceived convictions is rather unfair.
