				Profile other users on here? I find myself doing it more and more as curiosity gets the better of me. Like I wonder what kind of a life they lead, guess as to their age and gender and education and experiences based on what they write. Find like´s / dislikes though posts.. I guess when SR is down and I havn´t got any sales to deal with and no good posts I have too much time on my hand and find it a fun activity. Although I´ll never know, Its kinda fun to do right? or maybe its just me, <br />ACE

				I don&#039;t profile for every user, but similar to kitkat when a loud mouth potential scammer becomes prominent I try to study their mannerisms, writing style, word choice, etc. to be able to recognize them should they ever come back under a different name.

				I don&#039;t try to profile people here, but whenever I go through my day to day life seeing random people here and there busy with life, I try to think myself how would I ever find out whether this person does recreational drugs, if so what kind and would they know about silk road?

				Generally no, only when I&#039;m investigating someone. I&#039;ve been doing pine recently, and the more I read the more I appreciate how much she knew. Her posts are gold for tech-heads. Even I haven&#039;t heard of the kind of advanced technology she was citing, and I thought I had seen it all. I hope it had nothing to do with LEs; it certainly appears from her posts that she could have been a significant threat to them, and a virtual avatar for Silk Road. I don&#039;t know anything about it other than she disappeared in mid November with the blackouts, that the account was modified early December to remit her sex, and then accessed again on 18 December by someone who was obviously not her, and I don&#039;t think it was her mom.<br /><br />Tell me I&#039;m wrong. Read her posts and tell me she wouldn&#039;t have been a priority. I&#039;m just amazed, and quite frankly a bit embarrassed, that no one on SR (except pine) has thought of even returning the slinging. I&#039;m sure there must be SOME hackers here. I&#039;m having to tread very carefully now nomad bloodbath is back as I don&#039;t want my posts deleted again (not necessarily bloodbath though, perhaps the OP did it), and I don&#039;t know what his thoughts are regarding returning the favour in regards to LE, but we are being attacked left, right and centre by them via virtual accounts, spamming, quickbuy hacks, image hacks, and god knows what else and nobody seems to give a damn. I won&#039;t hire a hacker so don&#039;t PM me for soliciting if you are, but if I was I sure as shit wouldn&#039;t be turning the other cheek.<br /><br />Anyway, didn&#039;t mean to write this much. Parenthetically the answer to the thread question is no, usually I don&#039;t read profile posts. Piece out.

				Godammit ACE, you gone? I&#039;ll have you know that I was in bed 10 minutes ago (still there) trying to get to sleep, and this image of Rox leaving the door open after the pizza guy delivered, and you saying, shut the fucking door, and I kept laughing, which made it impossible to get to sleep. So I reached my hand from under my blanket and logged in, and now that I&#039;ve sat up (had to get another pillow goddamn you!) I find you are gone.<br /><br />Thanks man. One in a million. :-\<br /><br />Nah, that&#039;s okay, I&#039;ll catch you another time. I&#039;m up (metaphorically) for the next 15 minutes then I&#039;m laying back down again. Life so hard. Blow Rox a kiss for me. Her posts had me in stitches yesterday. <br /><br />Piece out.<br /><br />(I also started thinking about pine, but then it got erotic and I thought, god I hope she&#039;s not a he lol)

You already know what I know about you though. You usually post on the Philosophy section so that&#039;s a dead giveaway. Seem to be interested in metaphysical and even spiritual things at moment. Hmm, what else. Um, I can tell when you&#039;re high? (Sometimes). That&#039;s about it.
