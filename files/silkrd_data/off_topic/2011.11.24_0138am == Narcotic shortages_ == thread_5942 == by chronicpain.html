				It seems every year there is a shortage of opiates. I don&#039;t know if its a national problem or regional or what. My pharmacy told me that there is a shortage of oxycodone and is having a hard time finding it. This doesn&#039;t only apply to oxycodone. I&#039;ve heard that this is happening with others as well. <br /><br />Anyone else experiencing these problems?<br /><br />cp

				There is in fact a shortage. After the Mega Class Action suits against Purdue and old style OC&#039;s (oxycontin), there is a major drive by FDA, DEA and Govie to yank back on this current so-called &quot;Epidemic&quot; of Pain Killer addiction, abuse and deaths. Try finding Oxycodone IR past 30 MGS? Forget 40&#039;s &amp; 80&#039;s even in Generic? In order to Not lose out, tons of these medicines are now abroad and sold by big Pharma. The next Key in all of this are the Physicians &amp; Dr&#039;s that are being slapped around for Prescribing Pain Killers. The trend right now by Pharma is to produce Tamper/Abuse Proof narcotics that seep out slowly. It&#039;s a vicious circle. Pharma cant make money cause Docs are not Prescribing so stuff goes over seas. Instant Release will always be available, but most likely in dire emergencies or hospital environments, Now with FDA Panel suggesting removal of Tylenol (APAP) pain relievers, why will big Pharma keep making it? It was said that once Opiates/Opiods start costing over $3-4 dollars per MG, it would just be cheaper to buy Smack. I can tell you I&#039;m already there! Look on this very site. 40 &amp; 80 IR Oxy&#039;s are coming from outside U.S. FDA is not going to approve anything ever again like Oxycontin. Big Pharma knows this and is on a holding pattern.
