				That&#039;s cool that he smokes weed and used to sell shrooms! I&#039;ve never actually done shrooms before, but I would definitely buy them and start if I bought from DPR lol<br /><br />But it&#039;s off-topic, I was either expecting lulz answers or legitimate answers from seasoned SRers! I&#039;ve known about SR for a while, probably about 1.5 years before I started using it, but I never thought I&#039;d actually be on here buying stuff, using safely, using responsibly, foruming, and all that stuff lol

				not much is known about the &#039;original&#039; DPR; having set sail a long time ago.<br /><br />for the fanatics; the new captain recently acknowledged in Forbes that he enjoys indica nugs at the end of a long day.

				I wouldn&#039;t be suprised if he has ordered here like all of us. There was the time, he also was a normal Roadie :))<br />And i am sure a few Vendors already sold some stuff to him, without knowing its DPR.<br />But isn&#039;t this the reason why we all purchase our drugs on here? Beeing a Human, which can decide freely without the fear of beeing a criminal?!<br />
