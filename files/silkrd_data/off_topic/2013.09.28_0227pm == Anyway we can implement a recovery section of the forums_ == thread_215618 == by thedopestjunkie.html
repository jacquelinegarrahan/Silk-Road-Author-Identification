				I know this seems like a backwards idea to most of you but lets face it some of us struggle more than others with this thing called addiction and in my experience being an addict and working with addicts nothing is more powerful than one addict helping another addict. And although I am not in recovery right now I know that I have some wisdom to share with other addicts that they may find helpful. Hell, some members of this community have helped me tremendously, more than any therapist or AA meeting. <br /><br />So I am just wondering is this a possibility? Anybody else think this is a good idea?

I would say your idea is forward thinking, progressive...certainly not backwards. +1 to you.<br /><br />Personally think that SR is almost ethically bound to provide such a forum space if it&#039;s possible, which I&#039;m sure it is.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Thanks intraterrestrial I would be happy to be a contributing member of said section of the forums. And if we have a section for drug safety and harm reduction then we should have one for recovery. <br />
