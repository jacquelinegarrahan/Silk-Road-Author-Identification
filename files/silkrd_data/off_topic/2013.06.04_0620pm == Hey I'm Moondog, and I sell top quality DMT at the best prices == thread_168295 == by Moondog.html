				The thing is,&nbsp; I could only afford a vendor account at Atlantis for now.&nbsp; Just not enough traffic over there,&nbsp; even though I have the best product at the best prices.&nbsp; So now I&#039;m trying to sell this batch of DMT so I can afford a vendor account at SR.&nbsp; I have very high quality DMT, at the best prices either here on SR or Atlantis.&nbsp; Sorry domestic only for now.&nbsp; If you have a strong forum presence and good rep than we can work something out in regards to a sample.&nbsp; I know SR would be better having me as a vendor.&nbsp; Help me prove it and you won&#039;t be disappointed.<br /><br />Thanks for your time, and hope to hear from all you fellow psychedelic cosmonauts!&nbsp; Here is my listing [CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion/item/view/107eab68b3

				I&#039;m totally interested in what I&#039;ve heard is the pinnacle of psychedelic experience - DMT. I don&#039;t even like going to the Atlantis site though. It feels riskier than this place and I&#039;m pretty sure that others agree since I&#039;ve heard lots of people complain about the number of scammers there. I&#039;ll PM you.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				First of all to the guy who said Atlantis has scammers, and it isn&#039;t safe. Atlantis has MORE safe guards than SR even, imo.. I&#039;ll always be loyal to SR, but Atlantis even pgp encrypts people&#039;s messages for them if they are too lazy, and has all the same escrow features. You can&#039;t even update a FE - Will update later type feedback, because of the fact that Atlantis does NOT want you to deal outside of escrow (of course some still do), and now let me get on to this guy &quot;Moondog..&quot; I was his first customer on Atlantis (actually he was my first vendor on this account on SR, OR Atlantis, and I had a diff account for a long time, but was only a lurker, and only started buying recently and have a combined total of like 5 purchases I think), and let me tell you about this guy, man... First of all he does not ask ANYONE for FE.&nbsp; Secondly, his prices are SO much better than other vendors (on both sites, too) especially for small quantities.. You can&#039;t beat 200mg of white, or yellow DMT for $20 usd that&#039;s like .15 btc, or something ridiculously cheap.. Also, he does not (or wasn&#039;t before don&#039;t think he is now) charge for shipping at all.&nbsp; When he has product in stock, and even when he went on a vacation like a week ago his customer service stayed TOP NOTCH.&nbsp; He is friendly, cool, honest, and to be real if I could get ALL my diff. vices from him I would NEVER use another vendor.. I feel like we&#039;ve kinda become buds in a short time in not so many messages between each other. You just know when you connect with a good dealer who isn&#039;t just out to make money.&nbsp; He believes in his product, and for example, he told me he had another drug (not going to post on here, cause I don&#039;t want you buggers to buy it all off of him before I get funds up, lol) that he wasn&#039;t posting yet for the sole reason that he couldn&#039;t sell it as cheap as he wanted to, and still make what he needed to make.&nbsp; Most dealers woulda just posted it, and raised the price, but this guy is LEGIT like that.&nbsp; I know I&#039;m probably going to come off as a suspicious poster after a new vendor posts, and now I am like up his fucking ass talking about him like he&#039;s the second coming of the messiah, or some shit, but for all I know he is, because the dude is righteous, and I just wanted to help him get the word out so he can get his funds together, and move onto SR, and hopefully become a killer vendor on here as well.&nbsp; Oh btw, his stealth was fucking great don&#039;t wanna give it away, but I had suspicions that my package had been opened, and they still sent it anyway. Looks totally like a legit product, but not going to say what.. It&#039;s a surprise.. lol. Last thing before I get off of here is I ordered on a Sunday night he shipped to me on escrow on Monday, and I think it got here on Wednesday? That&#039;s 2 days, and I&#039;m east coast, and he&#039;s west coast.&nbsp; No bullshitting with this guy.. Good gear, good communication, good prices!&nbsp; If you think I&#039;m just some clone account to give him good feedback, or something check me out.. I&#039;ve been on SR probably longer than he has. I post under this name now, and have been around a bit in the &quot;Suspicious Vendors&quot; thread under Rumor Mill with that guy Wraithe.&nbsp; I am totally unconnected to him in any way except that he brought me some killer DMT for a great price, and has been a real blessing as a vendor. Well, that&#039;s enough before he thinks I&#039;m about to propose to him, lol. Moondog for president! lol (He&#039;s probably going to give me a fuckin bitch slap for this ridiculous over the top post, but I truly believe everything I just wrote wholeheartedly!) Peace out guys.. And if you do buy some of his DMT learn the F how to blast off properly, or how to convert freebase into Hcl, or Fumarate and inject it or take orally with a MAOI.&nbsp; I don&#039;t wanna see anyone crying about not breaking through, and blaming him, cause they put their Dimitri in a fucking glass dick, and torched it wrong, and didn&#039;t take, but one toke, or something ridiculous, and wasted it.&nbsp; His gear is good I blasted off like 3, or 4 times, and still had enough left to get several friends a nice blast so they could at least get the experience of it.. Alright I g2g, but for real give this dude a shot.. He doesn&#039;t FE so what do you have to lose?<br /><br />P.S. Atlantis staff are VERY responsive, and any questions, or problems they answer within 24 hours, and have been very helpful to me so far... Peace out guys&nbsp; ;)

				*sigh*<br /><br />Remember when grams were sold at $60-$70 on SR? What happened to that? I never found out why the prices spiked so high.<br /><br />$90 isn&#039;t far off though, pretty good price.<br /><br />Never heard of Atlantis, but just checked it out and seems pretty cool.

				Hey,&nbsp; when I get the opportunity to move over to SR.&nbsp; I might lower my prices even more since I would have way more traffic.&nbsp; Definitely something I worth considering.&nbsp; Atlantis started getting attention when the DDOS attacks were taking place here at SR.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely worth checking out.&nbsp; People our offering some great prices in an attempt to get noticed.&nbsp; Worth a look for sure.

				Nice info, Maleficence. I&#039;m not looking to change sites but it&#039;s good to see some straight up info instead of propaganda one way or another.<br /><br />Moondog, I am (always) in the market for spice. You say you&#039;re only domestic so far but - without seeing a vendor profile - domestic where? I hate to make assumptions. I typically only order domestic, myself, but as powders go, DMT is pretty easy on stealth (given typical quantities). Hope we can do business some time.
