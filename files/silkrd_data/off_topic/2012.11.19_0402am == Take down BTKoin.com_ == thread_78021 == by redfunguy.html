				I would assume there are more than a few tech savvy hackers on SR.&nbsp; I may be underestimating what it takes to do this but maybe someone with some free time and willing to be a hero could do some sabotage to that fucking btkoin.com scam that keeps spamming the forums.&nbsp; It is a clear net site after all, and it is accepting transactions.&nbsp; Hell, it would be cool if someone jacked their cash somehow.&nbsp; Do a small transaction and get their bank details, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know, just throwing it out there.&nbsp; Obviously the best thing is to stay away from that scam but hey, maybe someone wants to be a hero, or maybe someone with some extra cash wants to put out a bounty.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; &nbsp;The possibilities are endless!

				BMR has hackers for hire. Some are scammers but others have legit feedback. You could pay them to DDoS the site&nbsp; ;D.

				To be fair anyone who actually falls for that probably shouldn&#039;t be here in the first place. The spam is damn annoying though

				It is blatantly a scam that is for sure, but I could see someone going through withdraws without a lot of money trying and hoping it is legit.&nbsp; But these guys deserve to go down for the spam alone, that is for sure.
