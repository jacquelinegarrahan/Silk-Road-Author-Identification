				I thought it&#039;s high time us Brits had are own thread, as we are after all a major cog in the wheel what is Silk Road. we can come together and chew the fat , and make fun of our American friends. If people disagree, then someone else just start it up. If there are no comments I&#039;ll take it as a bad idea and remove it. cheers<br />
