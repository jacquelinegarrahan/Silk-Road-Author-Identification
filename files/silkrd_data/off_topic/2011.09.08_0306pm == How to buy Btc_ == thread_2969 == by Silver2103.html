				See forum bitcointalk.org on the clearweb. <br /><br />Also, give get-bitcoin.com a try on the clearweb. Keep your single transaction size &lt; $1000

I suggest try searching again. or better yet, look under the *security* thread - which, oddly enough, has a *bitcoin* subcategory listed directly under *security*... right smack in the middle of the forums homepage. <br /><br />and, if you once again, somehow, find absolutely nothing under that thread, go to SR&#039;s wiki page and look there. and if that does not help, go to that BTC forum that someone was kind enough to post for you. <br /><br />always, read read read read - before you decide to do anything, including posting a new topic which has been asked a dozen times within the past week. then. read some more. we have all been newbs. but somehow we have all survived - most of us, by literally reading as much as we possibly can before doing a single thing in the marketplace. any question you can possibly imagine asking regarding Silk Road, bitcoins, PGP, drug safty, more bitcoins, security, shipping, etc etc etc etc - has been answered.<br /><br />this. I promise you.

				Today I posted a thread with a similar question regarding websites or services that allow you access and use of your bitcoins instantly after buying them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been looking for such a website but have yet to find one.&nbsp; Id love to be pointed in the right direction.&nbsp; In my thread a user asked how to buy bitcoins.&nbsp; For anyone interested heres the guide I posted.&nbsp; Im sure there are better and hopefully quicker ways of buying bitcoins, but this is the method that Ive successfully used: <br /><br />For my first and so far only bitcoin transaction I used get-bitcoin.com<br /><br />First, fill out the buy form.<br /><br />Leave &quot;maximum price&quot; blank if you want your transaction guaranteed.&nbsp; &quot;Maximum price&quot; is the maximum price your willing to pay per bitcoin.&nbsp; If the cost of bitcoins is higher than your chosen &#039;maximum price&#039; at the time your bitcoin buy is processed, your transaction will be cancelled and your money refunded.&nbsp; Since bitcoin prices fluctuate and get-bitcoins doesn&#039;t provide instant service (transactions take at least a day depending on how fast you provide payment) its best to leave these option blank.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in no rush and/or are unwilling to possibly pay slightly more per bitcoin, choose a maximum price your willing to pay per coin and insert that number here.<br /><br />In order to get your &quot;bitcoin address&quot; login to SR and click &quot;account&quot;.&nbsp; On your account page copy the number that follows &quot;to deposit bitcoins, send them to this address:&quot; and paste it where it says &quot;bitcoin address&quot; on the get-bitcoins buy form.&nbsp; This way, your bitcoins will be sent directly to your silkroad bitcoin wallet. <br /><br />Choose whichever payment method you prefer including western union (note, western union charges around $20 in fees, plus get-bitcoins charges a 5% commission). <br /><br />After submitting the order, closely follow the payment instructions given to you by get-bitcoins.&nbsp; These instructions will be based on your method of payment.<br /><br />Please note:&nbsp; Fees will be subtracted automatically from your bitcoin buy (get-bitcoins has a 5% commission I believe).&nbsp; Do some math ahead of time and plan accordingly.&nbsp; In order to cover commission fees and still have enough for your purchase, spend a few extra bucks on bitcoins .&nbsp; Also, in order to calculate how much cash you must spend in order to get the correct corresponding amount of bitcoins (depending on how much your silkroad purchase costs), use a bitcoin calculator prior to buying bitcoins<br /><br />This is the easiest method Ive found but Id love to see some other suggestions, especially those that are instant. Im still new to the process. <br /><br />Hope this helps!! :)
