				And they were delicious! Tonight, I took some locally sourced LSD... we&#039;ll see how that plays out. Maybe make some swordfish ceviche this time... just call me SpaceChimp, the Psychedelic Chef.<br /><br />Let me just say, before I am whisked away into the Land of Patterns and Colors, that psychedelics are the king of drugs. After being caught up in opiates for a number of years, I forgot how magical this stuff it. Truly, medicine for the soul. And fun as fuck, to boot.

				That&#039;s pretty impressive. I made chocolate fondue one time when I was high but I usually stick to whatever processed junk I can stick in my mouth without any effort.&nbsp;

				Last time I was tripping I ate a bag of popcorn and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />No wonder I had such bad bodyload during the comedown. :(<br /><br />Gonna try and eat something more substantial next time. Pizza sounds good and easy enough!

				I used to get high with a guy going to culinary school...<br /><br />He&#039;d start cooking, and he&#039;d make tons of little dishes, fancy-restaurant style. Except he had no fancy-restaurant tools, so he invented every process and tool he used - grilling fish in the panini press, carmelizing onions in a spoon with a torch lighter...<br /><br />And it all tasted incredible. Good times.

				Last weekend my buddy came home from college for the weekend. We each took three hits of the last of Asbjorn&#039;s ganeshas. After an hour or so of already having peaked I cooked up some sausage links and eggs. Friend was too disoriented to do so but it was actually really easy. Tasty as fuck too.

				Two weeks ago I&#039;ve had the best meal of my life. It was more then just food. Every bite triggered a reaction that wasn&#039;t just taste.&nbsp; It was an intensely positive experience for almost every human sense. Chewing gave a sensation starting from my teeth through my head which I still can&#039;t find the proper words for to explain. Swallowing let the food flow and nourish my body.<br /><br />I had a very hard time controlling my laughter and even cried a little&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />It was fruit yoghurt with some crunch.<br /><br />With an evil amount of acid as appetiser.<br />The night wasn&#039;t all good though. That&#039;s just part of the game.<br /><br />
