				My boyfriend&#039;s 18th birthday is coming up and I would like to surprise him with giving him a drug (he doesn&#039;t know I&#039;ve joined SR and can purchase drugs in the drug-cold climate we live in). He is fairly inexperienced (which of course he should be at this age&nbsp; ::) ), but he smokes weed regularily, and has tried LSD and ecstacy one time each. He didn&#039;t _enjoy_ the LSD (he forgot how to talk/eat, scary things happened), but says it&#039;s one of the best experiences he had in his life (because he learned things about himself and retrieved old forgotten memories etc). The ecstacy he liked, but he didn&#039;t praise it. I think what I&#039;m searching for isn&#039;t a party drug, but it&#039;s also not an non-social drug (LSD). I would like to find the perfect date drug, something he&#039;d enjoy while he&#039;s with me and which could take us together to experience something special (we&#039;ve been together since we were 15 so we are very comfortable with eachother). Does anyone know a drug that might suit this purpose?&nbsp; ;D

				Blow and shrooms both seem fun - in different ways. I don&#039;t know anything about blow except that a friend who traveled to Colombia took it there and told me he was &quot;king of the world&quot; after taking it - doesn&#039;t sound bad at all&nbsp; ;) Shrooms is definitely a good idea, and when it comes to presents it is also important how they are presented, does anyone have a recipe for making a birthday shroom cake?&nbsp; :D

				i have no recipes for cake but if u throw about 30g onto a pizza between u (15g per person), u will have alot of fun&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />or tea if u cant eat them cos they can b stinky, jus boil the shrooms and then strain them multiple times, 3 or 4 times will b plenty, then jus add teabags and sugar, simples...<br /><br />regards....<br /><br />

				These are all great suggestions and I want to try all these drugs.&nbsp; ::) There&#039;s so much out there I don&#039;t know where to start. From a guy&#039;s perspective I suppose a sex drug might be desirable, although it is hard to imagine how sex could be made better when it&#039;s already extremely highly rated among guys. Will blow or MDMA make sex better for the girl? Do any of these drugs interfere with birth control pills (I&#039;m guessing no, but better safe than sorry)? Do the drugs just make the girl hornier or does the orgasm get more intense or what happens? Is blow or MDMA a better sex drug? If I gave him cocaine I&#039;d definitely knock him off his feet, but it might be better starting out with something slightly less illegal when buying the first time. MDMA seems easier to ship than shrooms.The Moxy seems nice too. I need to read up on this stuff (which takes ages with this TOR browser - loading a page takes 20 seconds). Thanks for all suggestions&nbsp; :)

Sure, it&#039;s pleasurable, but it&#039;s not blow-my-mind-amazing as he would describe it. I also don&#039;t think that&#039;s because he&#039;s doing it poorly because we&#039;ve had time to practice. It&#039;s probably just me, and I wouldn&#039;t mind a sex drug for myself. I&#039;d love to feel what my boyfriend feels, and perhaps if I did, I&#039;d also want to have sex marathons.

				2c-b sounds like what you are looking for.&nbsp; Psychedelic but not overwhelmingly so like LSD can be, very empathetic and being with loved ones feels good.. sex is amazing on it.&nbsp; 15-20mg each will make for a beautiful night

				2c-b is a good suggestion! Incredible visuals, makes you horny, and its not a spiritual one so it won&#039;t fuck his shit up.<br /><br />But I&#039;d steer clear of MDMA. It&#039;s probs my favourite drug ever but its a common thing that guys struggle to get it up when rolling, I know I and a lot of peeps here have experienced this.<br /><br />MDMA + viagra might work but you can have adverse reactions, 2c-b is probs the best bet

				120 mg MDMA. 1.5 hours in, add 15-20 mg 2C-B.&nbsp; Set up your house with lights, good music, good food, and a place to cuddle.&nbsp; You&#039;ll have a fabulous time.

About 3/4 of the way through, start smoking some green. Regardless if Molly is around, I&#039;ve found that green can achieve said desired results ( dick like steel ) with no problem. Keep in mind all I smoke is indoor med (or better ;-) yeah that was directed towards my hero lol), so the same might not hold true for less than great stuff. Aaannnnnyyywwaayyy, that&#039;s my two cents. Alcohol might help if you wanted to go the MDMA route. Idk I&#039;ve never fucked your boyfriend and have no plans in the near or distant future to do so. But yeah, let him wake up with your mouth around his dick. Hard to get the day off to a bad start after that.

				Very true, although it might give us some incentive for many more people to join in the thread :). I&#039;m sure everybody here is just a horndog, though. But to be on-topic, I would definitely reccomend MDMA or Mushrooms. Better yet, why not hippie-flip and take them both at the same time? I hear nothing but good things about it you can read plenty of trip reports on erowid about it. People say they complement each other really good and it is like a really happy psychedelic mushroom trip. I am fiending to try it. I think I will only be able to do 25i NBOMe + MDMA for now until I either harvest or buy more mushies.

The ecstacy he liked, but he didn&#039;t praise it. I think what I&#039;m searching for isn&#039;t a party drug, but it&#039;s also not an non-social drug (LSD). I would like to find the perfect date drug, something he&#039;d enjoy while he&#039;s with me and which could take us together to experience something special (we&#039;ve been together since we were 15 so we are very comfortable with eachother).

				Best to ask him, or talk casually about drugs and he might just open up.<br /><br />He might want to just go out and havbe a nice meal? Does he drink? I do but God says IU should not or something. <br /><br />So, ask him, there are too many drugs here to really but them all!

The thing is that I was around when we turned 15, 16 and 17 also, and I think I&#039;ve gotten an idea what he likes. For one thing, he loves surprises. Another thing he loves is experiencing something he has never done before, or going someplace he has never been before. I realize there will automatically be some pressure on using the drugs I get for him, and I wouldn&#039;t present the opportunity if I didn&#039;t know that he would tell me if he didn&#039;t want to do it. If it turns out my boyfriend doesn&#039;t want to do this new drug which I&#039;ve gotten for him, I will just tell him &quot;okay, let&#039;s go play with your other presents&quot; ( I&#039;ve already bought &quot;normal&quot; presents for him as well (if not for this, then to cover up for his parents)).<br /><br />I personally think you should stop spending money on something you don&#039;t even like (alcohol). Even if you&#039;re making your girlfriend company to a shitty bar you don&#039;t have to waste your money on drinking, just order a coke/juice/milk/your drink of choice. If she asks you to do something you explicitly dislike (get drunk together) she might not be the one for you.

				It is finally time to order (took me a while to get everything set up and tested)! It will be either MDMA + 2c-b or only 2c-b. Can anyone tell me what will be the difference for me and my boyfriend if we combine MDMA and 2c-b compared to if we only take 2c-b? I have never taken 2c-b before, so taking 2c-b combined with MDMA the first time would leave me curious about the 2c-b itself. I think the 2c-b is a bit more exciting because neither of us have done it before, but both of us have taken MDMA before.<br /><br />For our afternoon + night together I will make dinner and light candles. Should we take the drugs before, well before, or after dinner? Would we enhance or destroy the effect of the drugs if we shared a bottle of wine? Are there any activities that would be fun while on MDMA + 2c-b or only 2c-b? I don&#039;t really know what we will do, but I don&#039;t want to spend all day in bed fucking. Would we enjoy talking a walk in the city and looking at things? Would we like going to an amusement park and going on rides? Of course, you wouldn&#039;t know what we like, but I&#039;m asking what people typically like while they&#039;re on these drugs. <br /><br />I was looking at MDMA. Would the Ferrari/Shields advertised as 200 mg by chemical brothers be too much for us if we take one each and combine with 2c-b. I suppose we would take 20 mg 2c-b 20 minutes later as someone suggested. If we take only 2c-b and no MDMA, how large doses 2c-b can we take then? Also, how much does the sensitivity to 2c-b decrease after the initial dose (in case we&#039;d like to take some more a few hours in)? I&#039;m a little less than 60 kilos and my boyfriend is a little more than 60 kilos. Keep in mind that usually drugs don&#039;t get me as intoxicated as I want them to (and they seem to get others) for some strange reason.

				if I were you I would take three quarters of a Ferrari (trust me these pills hit hard lol) then an hour later take the rest of the pill, then half an hour later after that, take about 20mg of 2c-b orally.

Its very hard to control the effects of MDMA at high doses, especially for your first time. Not to mention when mixed with 2c-b afterwards.. <br />Also have some weed to smoke whilst you&#039;re on the MDMA, its an awesome combo. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow - 3 hours without food!
