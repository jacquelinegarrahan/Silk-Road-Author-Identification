				South Florida is under attack, and the non-native species threatening to wreak havoc seems innocent enough: It&#039;s not the giant Burmese pythons that made a home in the Everglades in 2000, nor a ravenous, land-walking fish like the Asian carp that have been eating through waterways farther up north.<br /><br />No, this foreign invader is a snail.<br /><br />But what a snail it is. The giant African land snail &quot;can grow as big as a rat and gnaw through stucco and plaster,&quot; says Reuters&#039; Barbara Liston. Since the monstrous mollusks were first noticed in the Miami-Dade County area in September 2011, researchers and vigilant homeowners have caught at least 117,000 of them, or about 1,000 a week. And &quot;residents will soon likely begin encountering them more often, crunching them underfoot as the snails emerge from underground hibernation at the start of the state&#039;s rainy season in just seven weeks.&quot;<br /><br />Just how big and bad are these slow-moving menaces? &quot;The largest stretch 8 inches,&quot; says Zack Peterson in the Ocala StarBanner. &quot;The oldest live nine years. The busiest lay up to 1,200 eggs&quot; a year. They eat at least 500 species of plants, plus the stucco and plaster that provide calcium for their shells. And if that&#039;s not disturbing enough, the snails &quot;even carry a parasitic nematode that can lead to meningitis in humans&quot; — though no cases of the pathogen, rat lungworm, have been found among humans in the U.S. yet. (Watch raw footage of the snails below.)<br /><br />They sound like &quot;monsters from hell sent to punish us,&quot; or at least Florida, says Michael Ballaban at Jalopnik. But &quot;perhaps the worst part of the invading monster snails is that if you hit one on the highway their shells are hard enough to cause a blowout.&quot; They can also turn deadly when a lawnmower hits one, flinging the shell out at high velocity. And then there&#039;s the slime trails they leave everywhere. &quot;It becomes a slick mess,&quot; Denise Feiber, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, tells Reuters.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t Florida&#039;s first battle with the giant African land snail. The Sunshine State won the last war — in the 1960s, after a boy brought three snails home from Hawaii — but it wasn&#039;t cheap or easy. Those three snails turned to 17,000 in seven years, and beating them took 10 years and $1 million. &quot;Feiber said she doesn&#039;t want this eradication project to last that long,&quot; reports the StarBanner&#039;s Peterson. So last week, her department held a strategy roundtable with experts from across the U.S. and Canada.<br /><br />How did this invasion start? &quot;One possibility being examined is a Miami Santeria group, a religion with West African and Caribbean roots, which was found in 2010 to be using the large snails in its rituals,&quot; says Retuers&#039; Liston. Or somebody could have brought them in as pets, like in 1966. Or it could have just been an accident, like this decidedly unsavory possibility:<br /><br />&quot;If you got a ham sandwich in Jamaica or the Dominican Republic, or an orange, and you didn&#039;t eat it all and you bring it back into the States and then you discard it, at some point, things can emerge from those products,&quot; Feiber said. [Reuters]<br /><br />Miami-Dade is ground zero, but &quot;unfortunately, the invasion is not limited to Florida,&quot; says Josh Mogerman in the Chicagoist. These &quot;ticking environmental time bombs&quot; have been found in upper Midwestern schools, pet shops, and even one private breeder&#039;s operation. <br /><br />They&#039;re huge, they move around, they look like they&#039;re looking at you... communicating with you, and people enjoy them for that.... But they don&#039;t realize the devastation they can create if they are released into the environment where they don&#039;t have any natural enemies and they thrive.<br />

				They eat the stucco off of houses because it helps build their shell.&nbsp; And I thought Australia had weird animals :o<br /><br />First Florida gets overrun with a quarter million pythons and now giant snails...&nbsp; What a tourist attraction! :D
