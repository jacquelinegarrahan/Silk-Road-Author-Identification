				Got a load of fresh £50 notes today (no not bent ones, so don&#039;t PM me and ask) and I was having a look at them and I have to say I think their design is much nicer than the old ones. I think using Matthew Boulton and James Watt on the back is pretty appropriate as well given then historical significance. Also like the fact they put Boulton&#039;s famous quote of &quot;I sell here, Sir, what all the world desires to have - POWER&quot; as well. Adds a sense of occasion to it all really. <br /><br />Anyone else think they look nicer than the old £50 notes?&nbsp;

I used to teach at a college named after him (LEO scribbling away furiously...)<br /><br />I saw some of the new notes a few days ago. Sorry to disappoint any forgers out there but these are going to be very difficult to forge, the metal strip is actually contained inside the note itself rather than weaving intermittently throughout the paper ; I&#039;d love to see them reproduce that!<br /><br />V.

				I can see where you are coming from with them looking like Euros but I think they look nice anyway. I especially like the back design.<br /><br />I tell you what is a sexy little number, the 500 Euro note. I love sniffing Bing with them but they don&#039;t have the magic of the £50. I think that&#039;s because the British 50 is a bit of an institution in it&#039;s own right whereas the Euro not only is used in lots of different countries so doesn&#039;t have a real identity but also now is a symbol of a retarded financial idea that was designed to fuck everyone over from the start.... Not that I think the Euro was a shit idea or anything... <br /><br />Having said that. 500 Euro notes do make smuggling cash through an airport FUCKING easy. Swings and roundabouts I guess.
