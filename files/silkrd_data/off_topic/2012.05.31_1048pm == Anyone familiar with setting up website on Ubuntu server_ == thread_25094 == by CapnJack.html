				I&#039;m not sure to understand what you are asking. Did you put your website inside apache and configured it properly? Did you set your href as relative links and not absolute? Are you specifying the right ip address within the browser? And if you are trying to access your machine from outside your lan, did you forward the port 80 on your router?

				Yes the website is inside apache but I&#039;m not sure if I configured it the right way.&nbsp; If I remember correctly it asked for the server name and I left it as localhost (but I could be mistaken)&nbsp; <br /><br />If I understand relative vs absolute, the pages I programmed, and are working correctly, are absolute.&nbsp; The ones I downloaded (clipbucket) are the ones that I can&#039;t get to work.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how they are set up though.<br /><br />If I put the ip address of the server in the page I am browsing to I can access it.&nbsp; (Example 192.168.x.x/clipbucket) but then none of the links I click on work unless I change localhost in the beginning to the ip address.<br /><br />Eventually I will be accessing from outside the LAN but I&#039;m not as worried about that part right now.

				Ballzinator is right! Btw you can change what localhost means inside /etc/hosts but it&#039;s NOT recommended at all!
