				greetings sr community. i have a business model based on the same technology used by sr to protect clients from the prying eyes of the powers that be.<br /><br />it&#039;s pretty simple, i need to advertise my .onion url, but i don&#039;t have the start-up cash to buy a merchant account on sr. so i need somebody to help me advertise my service on sr, either through a merchant account, or by any other means.<br /><br />it&#039;s beauty lies within it&#039;s simplicity...<br /><br />a simple game of chess, both players agree to a wager and winner takes all, minus a commission to the website and it&#039;s affiliates.<br /><br />i just started planning for this project today, and before i present my business model, i just want to explain why any of you would be interested.<br /><br />if you have a merchant account, i can give you an affiliate number for my site, and every game played and won, either by forfeit or ownage, the player will receive his winnings and a 4% commission will be given to the merchant who gave him the invite. just instruct the user to input his invite code when registering with the site. it&#039;s exactly like sr given that all transactions are anonymous and the commissions and wallet transfers are automated by the scripts implemented within the site.<br /><br />if your interested, please send me a message and i will keep you updated on my progress. i expect the site to be ready to launch within the month, but maybe longer due to my current living arrangements. (i might be moving soon)<br /><br />so without further adoo, here&#039;s my business model...<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">****HOST CHESS GAMES****<br /><br />**MEMBER CREATE ACCOUNT<br />&nbsp;**API CREATE WALLET<br />&nbsp; **PHP LOG USERNAME AND USER ID AND WALLET AND ACCOUNT BALANCE<br /><br />**MEMBER FUND ACCOUNT<br />&nbsp;**PHP LOG ACCOUNT BALANCE<br /><br />**MEMBER CREATE A GAME<br />&nbsp;**PHP LOG USER ID AND GAME ID<br />&nbsp; **MEMBER ESTABLISH BITCOIN WAGER<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;**API CREATE ESCROW WALLET AND TRANSFER BTC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; **PHP LOG ESCROW WALLET AND GAME ID AND WAGER AMMOUNT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**MEMBER AWAIT OPPONENT<br />~**MEMBER CANCELS GAME<br />&nbsp;~**API TRANSFER BTC FROM ESCROW TO CREATOR WALLET<br /><br />**MEMBER JOIN A GAME<br />&nbsp;**MEMBER ACCEPT BITCOIN WAGER<br />&nbsp; **API TRANSFER FROM MEMBER WALLET TO ESCROW WALLET<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;**PHP AWAIT READY STATUS<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; **BEGIN GAME<br /><br />**MEMBER FORFEIGHT<br />&nbsp;**API TRANSFER BTC FROM GAME ID ESCROW WALLET TO WINNER USER ID WALLET - 11% COMMISSION<br />&nbsp; **API TRANSFER 4% FROM ESCROW TO PARTNERS AND AFFILIATES<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;**API TRANSFER 7% FROM ESCROW TO PERSONAL WALLET<br /><br />**MEMBER CHECK MATE<br />&nbsp;**API TRANSFER BTC FROM GAME ID ESCROW WALLET TO WINNER USER ID WALLET - 11% COMMISSION<br />&nbsp; **API TRANSFER 4% FROM ESCROW TO PARTNERS AND AFFILIATES<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;**API TRANSFER 7% FROM ESCROW TO PERSONAL WALLET<br /><br />~**MEMBERS DRAW<br />&nbsp; **API TRANSFER BTC FROM GAME ID ESCROW WALLET TO BOTH MEMBERS EVENLY - NO COMMISSION<br /></code>

				in hindsight, i am probably going to reduce the 11% commission to 4% commission and give all of it to the affiliates, to make it more profitable for the players. also, i think it would be best to keep game winning statistics out of the database, to give each player a competitive edge. i don&#039;t like elitism... it makes my skin crawl...<br /><br />tell me what you think ladies!
