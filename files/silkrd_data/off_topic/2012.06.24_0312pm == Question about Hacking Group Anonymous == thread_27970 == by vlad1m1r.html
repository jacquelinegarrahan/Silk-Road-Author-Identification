				Dear all,<br /><br />After fielding a couple of questions concerning my previous Avatar (a 2D representation of a maze) concerning whether it was a &quot;square brain&quot; or an &quot;optical illusion&quot; I have changed my Avatar to that of V - a character in the eponymous film, a fellow Brit, hero to many, villain to some and of course whose name begins with the same first letter as my user name.<br /><br />I have now received another message informing me that the Hacker Group Anonymous make liberal use of &quot;V&quot; masks and was I a member - firstly, this goes to show there&#039;s no pleasing some people. Second, rest assured I am a mere dabbler in the field of IT! <br /><br />This did lead me to wonder though, do Anonymous have any connection with SR? I appreciate they&#039;ve been responsible for attacks on several hosts of hidden services for CP but it would seem they haven&#039;t strayed onto the road thus far?<br /><br />V.

				There is no one single group called Anonymous, as the name suggests, which is why it&#039;s hilarious to read in news reports that &quot;Anonymous&quot; did something, stupid writers. You can do something in the &quot;name&quot; of anonymous, in it&#039;s spirit, it&#039;s zeitgeist, but there is no one single collective group of people who associate themselves with that tag.<br /><br />Secondly the fact that there is no single group called Anonymous means that to have a icon or logo would be an oxymoron and illogical.<br />

				The thing about anonymous is anyone can say they belong to it. It&#039;s more a set of ideas than a strict hierarchy. Although, there is a central group.<br />I doubt they&#039;d have anything to do with SR, I doesn&#039;t seem their style. I don&#039;t know for sure, but it doesn&#039;t feel like something they&#039;d do. Although DPR my share some similar views, I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />EDIT; damn it Oscar, you got in there first&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m sure that Anonymous has a presence here in that there will be people who are involved and also use the site, however it is far too informal as far as groups go to actually be active collectively. Remember Anonymous is pretty much a label for people who chose to associate themselves, rather than a formally organised group.

				anonymous main purpose if you can say they have one is anti-censorship. So in theory SR is kind of in that spirit in the way that drug prohibition could be seen as a form of censorship

				just wondering if anyone saw that interview on The Daily show last week. Jon Stewart was blown away from the fact hackers are just everyday people and not stereotypical nerds haha. And really most of the &quot;complicated stuff&quot; comes just from just knowing how a computer operates.
