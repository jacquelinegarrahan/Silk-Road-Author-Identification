				I know the title is somewhat of an oxymoron considering scammers are pieces of shit anyways buuuuttttt<br /><br />&nbsp;I find it quite amusing how many recent Vendor scammers come on the forums and TAUNT THE SHIT out of the people they scammed. I remember when scammers came, stole then rode off into the dark knight quietly. Now, I see them in the forums talking shit about how much they stole, how they&#039;re going to continue to come back and steal, how they&#039;ll never stop blah blah blah. I know I cant be the only one who&#039;s been seeing this shit.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Word. What happened to the good ol&#039; days, when we could depend on a scammer to have decorum enough to make a quiet, humble exit with our thousands of dollars?<br /><br />lololol no I do see what you mean. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s strictly a recent thing... I feel like there are always smug assholes.. maybe those assholes are just smartening up to how anonymous tor really makes them?<br /><br />or maybe people really are just getting shittier.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t want to believe that. :(

				Tell me if you think this is a half baked idea. SR adds a new feature to the vending process. Some percentage of every profit you make is transferred into an account. As a vendor, you can view the balance of the account, but you can&#039;t access the funds. At the end of every month, if there are no verifiable reports that you have scammed anybody, that money is released to your normal SR wallet, and the next month it starts building back up. If, during the course of a month, lots of verifiable accounts of a vendor scamming members start to come in, and the vendor is unable to justify or make things right, his account is suspended, and the money from his scammer insurance fund is distributed to the people he scammed, to help ameliorate their losses.<br /><br />That would clear up a lot of the scamming, although so would just not FE&#039;ing...

				^^^<br /><br />that&#039;s not gonna happen....vendors can&#039;t and definitely won&#039;t want to have potentially thousands of BTC tied up for a month.

I agree, it wouldn&#039;t work if it were to mess up the cash flow that vendors need to operate. But I bet you could come up with a percentage and period of time funds are held that would work for a large majority of vendors. The optimal setup would be where honest vendors aren&#039;t impacted by the change, don&#039;t even notice it, but anybody that scams leaves the road with a little less coin, while his victims have a little more btc in the wallets than they would have without this feature.

				Good idea but yea, no vendor would go for it which is also understandable. I wouldn&#039;t really want any amount, large or small, of money to be held by SR if I were a vendor.

				What about if it was like a punitive measure. For instance, this measure would only be implemented on a vendor account when some number of verifiable scam reports start coming in. If a vendor is honest and fulfilling orders, this measure would not apply to their account. But for the vendor who was planning to begin selectively scamming his customers after an initial period of legitimacy, they would have to contend with the fact that after the first couple reports start filing in, some percentage of their intake would be siphoned to an insurance account, and if they want that coin back they have to make right with who they scammed and turn legit, or else they go rogue and walk away with less illegitimate coin than they would have. <br /><br />This way legitimate vendors wouldn&#039;t be affected, only those that have already begun scamming. Maybe it would make scamming seem less profitable to the potential scammer.
