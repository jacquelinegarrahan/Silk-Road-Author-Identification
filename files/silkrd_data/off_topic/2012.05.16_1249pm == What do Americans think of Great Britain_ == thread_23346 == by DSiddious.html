				As they wouldn&#039;t be there talking our language if it wasn&#039;t for us then I think they should hold us in high esteem. They must do otherwise they wouldn&#039;t steal our history, Princess Diana and tea and crumpets. :P<br /><br />Love you really America, you&#039;re alright.

				I think that Great Britain is worse than USA in several aspects. Surveillance obsessed, the media is full of extremely blatant propaganda, etc. GB takes these things even further than the USA does. I don&#039;t get quite the same Christian fundamentalist vibe from GB as I do from the USA though, and GB seems less hell bent on transforming the entire world to be in line with its moral crusades, although that is probably largely because USA works ultra over time at that. <br /><br />I see GB as a modern era fascist police state and the USA as a modernized, slightly watered down Christian version of radical Islamic countries.

				I think their brand of colonialism was pretty cruel, but then again Belgium and Leopold II... and our brand of colonialism was/is disgusting as well.<br /><br />I think we&#039;ve imported a lot of great media from you guys, I think working class accents are sexy, I think Americans who try to use British phrases and fake accents, who are the GB equivalent of Japanese weeaboo are idiots, I think Cockney rhyming slang is interesting linguistically<br /><br />I hate how in our media any kind of British accent = automatic bad guy

As much as the media in the US pisses me off, I wouldn&#039;t be able to handle it in the UK - they seem to invent the news on a regular basis. I couldn&#039;t stand being on surveillance cameras so frequently, nor could I stand being that close to Ireland.<br /><br />I noticed a huge surge of anti-US sentiment shortly after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars broke out. Not saying they weren&#039;t deserved, but it felt any discussions on the topic left Americans having to defend themselves, even if they didn&#039;t agree with the decisions made.<br /><br />I like British actors in American movies, but like very few British movies. Most US television shows are imported or duplicated; we&#039;re both suffering from bombardment of &#039;reality&#039; television, more so in the US. We have American Idol, they have Britain&#039;s Got Talent, even the likes of Hoarders, they have a nearly similar show called Hoarder Next Door.<br /><br />What the UK is missing is America&#039;s heartland, the backwater hillbilly hole-in-the-wall towns. Well you have Scotland, but it&#039;s not the same, they make scotch not moonshine, spend their weekends playing/watching rugby not Nascar, and while they both live off fried and deep-fried foods I don&#039;t think they&#039;re on the same level until they start deep frying Oreos, Twinkies and Pickles.

Also you must hand over encryption passwords at the demand of a law enforcement official. Also isn&#039;t it illegal to photograph police there despite having essentially every square inch of the country under surveillance? I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people. Plus GCHQ has British internet traffic watched to just as much an extent as NSA has US internet traffic watched. The bias in British media is even more blatantly obvious than in US media and it seems ultra-sensationalism is the in thing there amazingly to even a greater extent than in the USA. GB appears to be a lot like USA but with out even having pretend restrictions on government power. Not to mention data retention is required by law for between six months and two years. Not to mention you are behind the great firewall of Britain, which blocks access to the pirate bay among other things. I could probably go on and on about examples of how Great Britain is a police state, but I think this list is enough. <br /><br />Also I shouldn&#039;t forget to mention how everything there is ultra-government-regulated in the stupidest ways, GB is like the love child of Orwell and Kafka.

( Who watched the youtube video where people were asking random Americans to point out on a map where they think named countries in europe are?) :)<br /><br />I love UK for their underground squat raves, country drug history, the multi coultured London, the good and the bad people who make UK what it is now. <br /><br />Despite the fact weed is illegal, you can easily get away with it, as long as you are caught by the right po-po. Of course, there are the cunt types, but also the good ones who will tap you on the back and say <br />&quot;try not to make it so obvious next time&quot; smile and walk away. Happened to me while we were smoking weed in central London.<br /><br />I know this isn&#039;t an Americans opinion, but I wasn&#039;t born in here either. The only worrying thing about UK is that it might be getting a bit too multi coultured, I personally think religion is a threat to the UK, and we will probably find out why in a few years. I am not BNP or a racist, but if i saw people trying to convert others in my own country, on such a big scale with so much sense of freedom, I would start worrying. Believe in what you want, but don&#039;t try convert others, especially in an aggressive way!<br /><br />Anyway I have been to the NY once, I liked it but it reminded me of London a bit to much, next time I will go to the US, I will definitely hit up on some wild west shit, America always looked exciting to me.

				I think you would be disappointed going outside of any major city in the US, unless your going for outdoor activities (boating, fishing, hunting, hiking, etc). The closest thing we have to the &#039;Wild West&#039; now is certain areas around the Mexican border.<br /><br />If your into the outdoors, then I&#039;d highly recommend Colorado - great and easy to find bud, and the scenery is similar to the Swiss Alps. Montana and Alaska might give Colorado a run for it&#039;s money though, I very much want to go on a 1 month excursion in Montana&#039;s wilderness one day.<br /><br />If your looking for a beach, I&#039;d forget California and Miami, best beach I&#039;ve been to in the US is Destin Florida. If your looking for a club scene, then I&#039;d say South Beach, Miami - it&#039;s Friday night 7-days a week with people from all around the world rolling and partying for days on end.

				I was born in America but when i was 5 we moved to Germany where i spent the next 7 years. Germany is cool as fuck. I miss Europe overall, I never had the chance to go to GB, but i&#039;ve seen it as quite similar to the US, more so than any other European nation that i know of. <br />As someone said we have more Christian fundamentalist bullshit but you guys are all about surveillance. We both have ignorant and trashy people, just like I&#039;m sure both countries have some cool ass motherfuckers too. <br /><br />I grew up in Germany as a kid,so we did a lot of traveling and shit to France, we went Belgium a lot, Belgiums cool, I&#039;m a fiend for their fucking chocolate, those truffles man. I used to play in a league where we&#039;d travel to Belgium a lot, we&#039;d always stock up on chocolate. <br /><br />Great Britain is cool, but if i was in Europe I&#039;d live in Germany or Holland or Belgium, thats the part of Europe I really dig. <br /><br />Now that i live in America though I&#039;m trying to check out the cool places we have. Some major cities can be hit or miss, I&#039;m not too big a fan of Chicago, although St.Louis is cool. <br />I love Colorado. My buddy lives out there and i go out an visit every chance i get. Even in their big cities its not crowded, not skyscrapers or anything, gorgeous landscape, AND cheap, amazing legal weed. Also Red Rocks Amphitheatre is out there, which is the coolest venue I&#039;ve been to. Me and my girlfriend are actually saving up to go out there. <br /><br /><br />I wish America would develop huge bullet trains that span states...

				It&#039;s hard to get to know people in the UK.&nbsp; There seems to be an unspoken requirement that to have a conversation with someone you must know them first, or have a mutual friend.&nbsp; But the flip side of that is in the US people just walk up to you and start talking.&nbsp; &quot;Hi there, how ya doin&#039;?&quot;&nbsp; You can travel through the UK and not be annoyed by people who have nothing to say.&nbsp; <br /><br />While Britain&#039;s police-state measures concern me, I always found it contradictory that most UK policemen patrolling the street are usually approachable and sometimes, even easy going.&nbsp; I was at an event in London and was standing on a crowded sidewalk trying to get a picture.&nbsp; I backed up into the street as I tried to frame the shot and a policeman said to me &quot;Careful sir, you&#039;re stepping into traffic.&quot;&nbsp; How helpful. In the US the cops probably would have yelled at me or pushed me one way or the other (In the US it seems common for cops to be suffering from &#039;roid rage).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, people in the UK seem more sensitive to police use of force.&nbsp; During the running of the Olympic torch through London several years ago (when China was hosting the Olympics) the streets were lined with protesters.&nbsp; As runners took their turn carrying the torch protesters would occasionally run alongside the torchbearer and shout anti-Chinese slogans.&nbsp; These protesters were quickly tackled and held by the police.&nbsp; The next day the British newspapers were filled with people denouncing the heavy-handed actions of the police.&nbsp; Shit, that&#039;s just the way things would be done in the US, and nobody would give it a second thought. <br /><br />I really admire the design and directions for the tube system in London. It makes traversing the city so much easier, and figuring out how to get from point A to point B takes a minimum of brain power.&nbsp; Contrast this to Los Angeles, where the car traffic is nightmarishly heavy.&nbsp; LA once had the beginnings of a public transit system but the automobile companies squashed it so that everyone would buy a car to get around town. <br /><br />All in all I like the UK, and would love to get a job transfer to somewhere in the London area or perhaps Scotland.&nbsp;

				I think most Americans think of the British as being essentially like us, only with a bunch of cosmetic differences. Calling this different things, doing things slightly different, but basically being us, even speaking the same language.

We watch you do things and roll our eyes but essentially we love you and like to indulge you in your favourite treats (our culture, history and our eccentric celebrities that you steal from us like Gordon Ramsey and Jamie Oliver etc). We go to war with you just so we can keep an eye on things while you do most of the work because now we have had our day it&#039;s your turn and we have to supervise you a bit while you take over from us. For example you didn&#039;t need us in Iraq or Afghanistan but you got us for moral support. <br /><br />But yeah, by and large we are very fond of you but we occasionally roll our eyes when you go a bit over the top. :)<br /><br />And the London Look girl is BUFF. The tooth thing is a sexy quirk.

Mexicans try to escape their shithole by jumping the border, Chinese by loading into cargo freight, Cubans on flimsy rafts, but Canadians are the smartest infiltrators, they entertain us and we throw millions of dollars their way.

				The drinkers in America just aren&#039;t as public as they seem to be in the UK I guess. I think it has a lot to do with the fact you can&#039;t really find good beer in most clubs/pubs, it&#039;s usually the restaurants and taprooms that have the quality brewed beer. Also, other than in a few cities, public transportation is rarely used, meaning drunk driving is a true epidemic in the US.<br /><br />So rather than pubs, the real beer drinkers pickup theirs and take them home rather than having a public pub to drink at. Microbrews are HUGELY popular in the US now, more than ever. Whereas I used to have to always stick to German or Belgium beers (or I do like Newcastle, but Guiness is absolutely disgusting) now I can get some great beers from the thousands of microbreweries in the US that match the quality.

				Lol well if your at a wild house party you&#039;ll be lucky if you can find someone who knows who the Queen is, most will have never heard of a Prime Minister and will think England is led by King Henry.<br /><br />There are some stellar clubs in the US of course, the best are in Miami if you ask me. During the 90&#039;s and early 00&#039;s, the rave scene in the US was spectacular, then it all but died off other than the diehards and underaged. Techno clubs converted to hip hop, it&#039;s been ugly. But it seems to be on a resurgence, in my city at least there are several underground rave groups that have one monthly.<br /><br />As for meth, that&#039;s not a problem, no matter where you are. In my area meth was always around, you can&#039;t turn on the news without a meth story of some sort each day. Heroin is making a huge comeback as well, for high schoolers especially. Several high schools in my area are having quite a problem with heroin, and it&#039;s the affluent schools as well with kids that have money to support the habit.

				Haha, that would be quite amusing. The phrase &#039;dumb Americans&#039; would certainly come to mind. :D Though I think Americans are quite smart... you stay in school longer than us Brits.

I&#039;ll have to pay for my education now though :( = less time and money for other things!<br /><br />In my area getting a job is near impossible... all the unskilled jobs tend to hire 16 year old&#039;s since they have a lower minimum wage. And 18 if it involves anything that could be dangerous (or selling alcohol) Again 18 year olds tend to cost less! <br /><br />Haha I&#039;ll certainly be able to track down a dealer by the sounds of it! I&#039;ve always been quite good at it... Got a lot of mates in my area who know people from other areas etc... (how do you think I survived before SR)

				Well, just to put you in the right direction to find meth, you&#039;ll want to find the shittiest trailer park on the outskirts of whatever city your in.<br /><br />I don&#039;t even defend the American education system, college/university was the biggest waste of time I&#039;ve ever had. The classes are a joke, you&#039;ll run into a few hardass professors that really make you work (usually in core classes) but more often than not it&#039;s either a lot of hand holding or a lot of nothing. If your going to school for engineering then that&#039;s different, but I went for computer science and IT management.<br /><br />The problem I see with the &#039;dumb American&#039; terminology is a combination of the facts that we have more very young adolescent children on the internet more than any other country and that we enjoy laughing at idiots so cameras always seem to find them, or follow them (Jersey Shore), which both perpetuate the idea.

				Same here mate, visit a rough part of the city and it&#039;s not too hard. I do live in a city where drugs are a problem. There was a documentary about how much easier it is to get heroin than getting a pizza. They did a test and this guy got heroin within 10 mins... whereas a pizza delivered can take an hour on a busy night.<br /><br />I agree with you about the problem with the net. I&#039;m partly less motivated by playing WoW (online game World of Warcraft) As much as I hate to feed the medias stereotypes, that one is quite true... with me anyway =) Gotta love the original Wow...<br /><br />Still I&#039;ve never had a bad long term reaction from drugs (honestly) The next day maybe being tired and slow (lack of sleep I take mainly stimulants) It&#039;s never been a problem.<br /><br />All these horror stories make me laugh =) It&#039;s silly people who overdo it for long periods of time... There was a a guy who took 40,000 XTC pills in a period of nine years... (look it up on google) They claim he suffers from depression, paranoia and hallucinations. The fact he&#039;s alive automatically puts it behind alcohol in terms of long term damage) Damn, 40,000 bottles of vodka in nine years would have killed him. <br /><br />

We see them here on vacation all the time. <br /><br />I would like to point out to the English man who said that the UK is 2-0 vs the Germans.<br /><br />Fact: The UK has been conquered by Germanic peoples 2 times (the Angles and Saxons and then later by the Normans, who were Danes living in France). The fucking Royal Family is a bunch of Germans who changed their names to be more English. Plus Germany has more World Cups than you do. That don&#039;t mean shit to me, but it should to you guys.<br /><br />Aside from that, I am an American of German ancestry. <br /><br />Due to online gaming, I have made friends with many a Brit over the years. I have to say, mostly pretty similar. They asked me if I liked that fucker George W Bush, and I liked them if they liked that fucker Tony Blair. Then they would say... oh yea.<br /><br />I got to say I do like David Cameron a lot, and Thatcher is one of my favorite world leaders of the second half of the 20th century. <br /><br />Barak Obama is an incompetent educated idiot. <br /><br />Got to give national leader edge to GB at the moment. <br /><br />Food: AMERICA, FUCK YEAH! I really thought I liked English food, until I went to England. Fish and fries are pretty decent over there, but its so bland. Even your beef sucks, and it will make you mad as a cow too.<br /><br />Beer: Northern half is amazing, southern half is about like America was before the Micro Brew boom.<br /><br />Lowerclasses: You have Wales, we have Alabama. We have niggers, you have sand-niggers (arabs)<br /><br />My favorite British city is Edinborough, I like the Scots more than the English. As an American from the South, I can identify with a region of one country that has been economically pillaged and raped by the other half after losing a war(s). And Scottish chicks only have to start talking to give me a boner. Also the geography of Scotland reminds me of home.<br /><br />History: Well, we dont have to envy English history, we have some of our own. Congratulations, you guys lived through the dark ages. You allowed someone to chop off your heads and do as he wished for a thousand years because his daddy did it. Furthermore, the only link you have to those folks are your ancestors, who are also our ancestors. That is a wash. Our histories diverge post 1789, I know I can&#039;t be objective, but as an American I like ours better. <br /><br />Internal politics: The UK is ran by a party(s) much like Soviet Russia or China, other than it is more answerable to the public. In America, there is a very strong element of local representation in our national government due to the way our House of Rep&#039;s use districts. You guys vote for a Party that selects its candidates (if I recall my international comparative politics class correctly).<br />Enough has been said about the UK&#039;s tendencies toward a police state, all I can say to that is thankfully that is one thing the US is several years behind the UK in. Although with the winding down of hostilities in Iraq and Afghan a lot of drones are coming home and being purchased by police departments across the country.<br /><br />Thats all for now.<br /><br /><br />

				Doner Kebabs are awesome. <br /><br />And nah German&#039;s aren&#039;t better than England, what it all comes down to is that Hitler couldn&#039;t invade us or bomb us into submission, doesn&#039;t matter what happens after that, Britain will always be more awesome than Germany. <br /><br />I do recognize that England has a lot of faults but I am a really passionate cook so that&#039;s where I stand my ground. I cook every day, it&#039;s sort of like my version of meditating with a tasty treat at the end. :)

				Great Britain is pretty cool...&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder how legitimate the whole &quot;equal countries&quot; thing is when it comes to Wales and Scotland compared to England...&nbsp; it always felt like England just sort of imposes their will on everyone else.<br /><br />I do think they are just about the most trustworthy nation in Europe, outside of perhaps Poland, when it comes to following through on international agreements and having each other&#039;s back.&nbsp; And they are one of just a handful of European countries that keeps a credible military these days...&nbsp; I get the sneaking suspicion that a lot of Europeans just sort of assume that European warfare is pretty much over forever, and that NATO is going to protect them anyways...&nbsp; so the USA/UK/Germany/France are basically subsidizing defense in a bunch of anti-military countries.<br /><br />The history is neat...&nbsp; but I&#039;m a huge European history buff, primarily from ~600AD-1800AD so it&#039;s hard to narrow down anything in particular.&nbsp; The dual monarchy is interesting, as is the Norman invasion... but I&#039;m partial to the old Holy Roman Empire and minor states like Ragusa, Epirus, Corfu and Moldavia.&nbsp; The information on some of them is so hard to find that it&#039;s quite rewarding when you do stumble across some... while most of us have gotten most of the history of the major colonizers.

Also you must hand over encryption passwords at the demand of a law enforcement official. Also isn&#039;t it illegal to photograph police there despite having essentially every square inch of the country under surveillance? I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people. Plus GCHQ has British internet traffic watched to just as much an extent as NSA has US internet traffic watched. The bias in British media is even more blatantly obvious than in US media and it seems ultra-sensationalism is the in thing there amazingly to even a greater extent than in the USA. GB appears to be a lot like USA but with out even having pretend restrictions on government power. Not to mention data retention is required by law for between six months and two years. Not to mention you are behind the great firewall of Britain, which blocks access to the pirate bay among other things. I could probably go on and on about examples of how Great Britain is a police state, but I think this list is enough. <br /><br />Also I shouldn&#039;t forget to mention how everything there is ultra-government-regulated in the stupidest ways, GB is like the love child of Orwell and Kafka.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Serious?! There are not more surveillance cameras than citizens, we have a lot of cctv around which is used 99% of the time to collect evidence of crime, not to monitor people<br /><br />&quot;GB courts even sentence people to have surveillance cameras installed inside of their homes&quot; - ABSOLUTE BOLLOCKS<br />&quot; I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people&quot; - More bollox i&#039;m afraid.

Not to mention you are behind the great firewall of Britain, which blocks access to the pirate bay among other things.

Good dependable USA Media?<br /><br />Sorry for any misconceptions but thought it my right as an Englishmen to protect my country.<br />I&#039;m English, I live in England and I speak English (maybe don&#039;t type so well though)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s true about the CCTV operators linked up to microphones. I think it was just a test run in one council. They were using it to brake up fights, saying &#039;YOU, in the purple shirt. STAND STILL. The police have been called...&#039; And, telling people to pick up the litter they&#039;d dropped. I don&#039;t know if they thought it was &#039;successful&#039; enough to roll it out across the UK.

Also isn&#039;t it illegal to photograph police there despite having essentially every square inch of the country under surveillance? I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people. Plus GCHQ has British internet traffic watched to just as much an extent as NSA has US internet traffic watched. The bias in British media is even more blatantly obvious than in US media and it seems ultra-sensationalism is the in thing there amazingly to even a greater extent than in the USA. GB appears to be a lot like USA but with out even having pretend restrictions on government power. Not to mention data retention is required by law for between six months and two years.

I could probably go on and on about examples of how Great Britain is a police state, but I think this list is enough. <br /><br />Also I shouldn&#039;t forget to mention how everything there is ultra-government-regulated in the stupidest ways, GB is like the love child of Orwell and Kafka.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Serious?!

Also you must hand over encryption passwords at the demand of a law enforcement official. Also isn&#039;t it illegal to photograph police there despite having essentially every square inch of the country under surveillance? I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people. Plus GCHQ has British internet traffic watched to just as much an extent as NSA has US internet traffic watched. The bias in British media is even more blatantly obvious than in US media and it seems ultra-sensationalism is the in thing there amazingly to even a greater extent than in the USA. GB appears to be a lot like USA but with out even having pretend restrictions on government power. Not to mention data retention is required by law for between six months and two years. Not to mention you are behind the great firewall of Britain, which blocks access to the pirate bay among other things. I could probably go on and on about examples of how Great Britain is a police state, but I think this list is enough. <br /><br />Also I shouldn&#039;t forget to mention how everything there is ultra-government-regulated in the stupidest ways, GB is like the love child of Orwell and Kafka.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Serious?! There are not more surveillance cameras than citizens, we have a lot of cctv around which is used 99% of the time to collect evidence of crime, not to monitor people<br /><br />&quot;GB courts even sentence people to have surveillance cameras installed inside of their homes&quot; - ABSOLUTE BOLLOCKS<br />&quot; I read that they even have spy microphones all over the place and are starting to put up speaker systems so people who watch the cameras / listen to the microphones can remotely issue orders to people&quot; - More bollox i&#039;m afraid.

Good dependable USA Media?<br /><br />Sorry for any misconceptions but thought it my right as an Englishmen to protect my country.<br />I&#039;m English, I live in England and I speak English (maybe don&#039;t type so well though)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s true about the CCTV operators linked up to microphones.

				I think Britain&#039;s great. love the television programming there. worlds better than the shit on american TV. I like the accent, people I have talked with have always been polite (limetless excluded ;p) I give lots of shit about them being just like another american state, but in reality, I don&#039;t know much about their policies, LE, anything other than the stereotypes that we all hear...and I think there food (before the Indian influence) was complete garbage (other than shepherds pie) the Indian influence in current british food makes it worth a go in any kitchen. (I enjoy cooking to relieve stress, and clear my mind when working on complex problems) I would love to visit one day, probably not london, but some countryside burg or village or whatever the Brits call their small farm towns (cobblestone streets if possible)

I just didn&#039;t have much fun when I went to England and wish I would of saved my money and days and just went straight to Italy. I spent a week in London and a two weeks in Italy.

				My favorite place I&#039;ve ever lived. :( I miss it so much it&#039;s ridiculous. The parties were amazing, cool stuff to see, always football, more social drinking atmosphere, love the accent... I&#039;m trying to get a tier two working visa to move back. Used to think it was expensive, but surprisingly it&#039;s not so bad. I think you can live much cheaper over there than in the States.<br /><br />The only downside is the weather is truly awful. We all got really excited because it was 23 in march. Then it pissed rain for the next three months and only started to get sunny-ish when I left mid-Summer. I missed the sun and heat a lot while I was there.

				Does the word have a negative cognitation there like it does here? If you use the word ain&#039;t here the assumption is that you are undeducated, hill billy, country, or ghetto. Basically impoverished and ignorant because you your education level. <br /><br />You do get all kinds of people saying it especially if you do live in the rural areas of the US even college graduates say it if they grew up in a small town like it is ingrained in them, so obviously that is a stereotype, but when growing up that is what school teaches you that it is a wrong term and poor uneducated people who live in stick houses in the mountains use it and not proper children that bathe and have running water.

				Does the Queen still not get her cake from Harrods anymore? what was that all about anyway?<br /><br />And I think Great Britain in general is more polite and civilized than the US. However, I can&#039;t share the details of my experience and can only wonder if certain areas of Great Britain can be equated to certain states in the US as far as education/demeanor of the individual. OR, maybe is it a class thing over there? (I hear on the Ricky Gervaise show how one of the guys dumbs down how he speaks when he&#039;s around hired help like plumbers or the such).

				This thread is like many chats I&#039;ve had in dive bars all over the wonderful USA. As an Irishman living in the UK but who&#039;s been to most of the states in the union I have to say that when you scratch beneath the skin there&#039;s not that much difference.. Intelligence, wealth, ignorance, charity, poverty, authoritarianism, freedom and a mutual love of booze (excluding a sizeable chunk of west Texas) are present in similar amounts in both nations. The climate does suck in the UK but having said that bad weather instills character. America has religious scrutiny, the UK has technological scrutiny and it&#039;s fair to say that the Brits like their American cousins like to get cunted....Just like the Irish. <br /><br />In my perfect Multiverse existence I&#039;d be living in West Cornwall from May to October and the rest of the time in Austin TX. <br /><br />LT

				I always liked the UK&#039;s history, as it predates the USA&#039;s by many many years. However, I feel like America is more &quot;free&quot; if you will. <br /><br />Your cars&#039; steering wheels are on the wrong flippin&#039; side though!!!&nbsp; ;)
