				Hey I heard off a good few people now that if you dry a banana peel for several weeks and smoke the soft part on the inside it gets you high. Is this just an urban legend or has anyone ever tried it? I&#039;m curious to know, I&#039;m pretty sure its fake but it would be a nice cheap high, Ive tried nutmeg and it took me about 2 days to get back to normal, I don&#039;t want any weird things happening with banana, maybe that&#039;s why monkeys are crazy...

				It&#039;s an old hoax from the 60&#039;s. It doesn&#039;t exist and I even tried it in my more naive days of trying to get fucked up on anything I could get my hands on.

Anyways, I&#039;m almost 100% positive that the banana thing is a hoax. Almost like how Cheech &amp; Chong smoked that dog shit before. It didn&#039;t really get them high, they&#039;re just always that baked.

				Haha, damn it would have been nice, and on the nutmeg experience don&#039;t bother doing it, its a very lightheaded feeling, takes about 8 hours to kick in and your brain is weird for the next few days. It tastes horrible and I think smoking it can kill you... -1 for nutmeg
