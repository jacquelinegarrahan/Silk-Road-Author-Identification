				Hey guys,<br /><br />So thanks to Silk Road and the amazing European drugs i&#039;ve been able to get a hold of lately I have a spare $5000 AUD i&#039;d like to spend on a holiday to visit Europe. I&#039;d like to travel as cheaply as possible though as my girlfriend will be joining me and she doesn&#039;t have the luxury of an illegitimate income.<br /><br />If you guys would be so kind as to help me out, what is the cheapest and best way I can experience Europe? I have never been over there and know almost nothing about the culture and what there is to do. I was thinking of buying flights to London and going on one of those Contiki tours but it seems like an awfully expensive way of doing the holiday. The places I most want to visit are:<br /><br />London<br />Italy<br />Paris<br />Spain<br />Amsterdam<br />Germany (I want to see Auschwitz as I had family that died in there)<br />Sweden<br />&amp; Switzerland<br /><br />But i&#039;m open to going anywhere that&#039;s really cool. I&#039;d like to stay in decent but cheap accommodation and spend most of my time doing cool activities, seeing beautiful scenery and partying in awesome nightclubs while doing loads of cocaine.<br /><br />Can any Europeans or people who have traveled there give me some tips and advice?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />AussieMitch.

				Have you checked https://www.couchsurfing.org/ ? It&#039;s maybe the cheapest way to travel, haven&#039;t done it myself but a buddy of mine has traveled a lot with this. There are also many hostels in most countries for cheap accomodation. Interrail is a good option for travelling&nbsp; if you re &lt;25 years old (cheaper ticket). But I think 5k USD would be enough for more luxurious options. It&#039;s a matter of how long you re planning to stay.

				i think you got enough funds for backpacking. if you start in England you could catch a train to Holland or France maybe take a ride on a ship to Sweden from there. Then another train to Germany and to Switzerland, Italy and then Spain.<br />Auswitz is in Poland! <br />out of these countries Sweden and Switzerland are the most expensive. <br />

				Flight between countries can be found for extremely cheap prices through Ryan Air. It&#039;s a no thrills type airline, but great value IMO. I remember flying from London to Ireland for 4 quid + 10 Quid tax. Hostels are a good place to stay as it&#039;s a great way to meet others who can point you in the right direction about, for example, best places to eat at and best pubs/nightclubs in town, etc. There are websites such as www.lastminute.com (cheap flights, hotels, etc) which offer great deals also.

				I agree with all destinations mentioned in this thread. Check out airbnb.com for cheap accomodation. I&#039;m an airbnb host myself.

				Sorry to jump as an American but I had tons of fun in Europe on my trip so I just wanted to share. England&#039;s Underground is great and cheap. Many places to find mischief around London so many pubs around and great fun. Stayed with some friends and her husband was from Scotland, still have no idea what he was talking about but we got wasted every night. I just nodded my head and laughed and all was good. Went to Wales for two days to play golf on some old course that was impossible to play lol. Go to a football game if you can!!! That was a good drunk and I didn&#039;t even know fk all about the teams. Take the train to Paris!! The only option taking the Chunnel is the Eurostar and I recommend it versus over the water, very quick. Rent a car in Paris!!!!!! I rented a car in Paris (what a blast to drive in that traffic! Very intense!) for a week and disconnected the speedometer. They had some crazy low mileage thing that would barely cover two days adventures so I crawled under and removed from the transmission. Put on tons of miles and returned well under the requirement. Good humor eh.<br /><br />Misc<br />- Paris is cool hit some clubs and little shops for food - fresh bread, pastries, and cheese YUM! I was with a German girl so they accepted me and got over the I hate American stuff lol.<br />- Mussels at some restaurant in Brussels, greatest ever! Bacon, leaks, butter, wine all in a huge pot YUM! <br />- Toured around some WW1 trench spots and also the Ardennes, great for me - nightmare for my lady<br />- Germany stopped at some castle and hit top speed on rental car for an extended time.. beat the shit out that thing on the autobahn :) At the pubs I found the locals to be weary of strangers at first but loads of fun if you can get in the circle. Drank pils cola there for the first time (beer and coke) strange<br /><br />I wish you a great time you will have a blast!<br />

				Your GF can&#039;t make any contribution at all? If not, Europe could be a stressful place unless you are willing to rough it.
