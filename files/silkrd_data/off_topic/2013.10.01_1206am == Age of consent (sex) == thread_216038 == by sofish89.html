				How does the age of consent work? It clearly says online and in the annotated code of Maryland that the age of consent is 16, however a coworker of mine who is a former cop always tells me about this 17 year old girl at work who he thinks is so cute and so on and he always tells me how he cant wait til she turns 18 in 5&nbsp; months. I showed him where it says that in the state of&nbsp; Maryland the age of consent is 16 not 18. He said he&#039;ll look into it and ask his cop friend who is a lieutenant. the next day he came back to me and told me i was wrong and that its 18 (and that it always has been)?!?<br />Is there some hidden law about the age of consent that i cant seem to find online, or is he wrong?

				&nbsp; You cannot get in trouble for having sex with an 18yo, no matter what.&nbsp; If she is 16(or whatever the age is where you are from) her parents might have a problem with that.&nbsp; If they do, they can press charges, and transporting a minor for sex across any regional or national borders is illegal everywhere.&nbsp; I had a gf once when I was in my early 20s, she was 17 and told me she was 18, I found out before her birthday.&nbsp; Since her parents were ok with me sharing a bed with her, the chances of getting into trouble would have been very slim, because of the closeness in age, but the parents can sway the minor to press charges if they are upset about being dumped or something, so I&#039;d suggest against it, especially if you are over 25.
