				A friend gave me some DMT to try this weekend. I&#039;m going to be smoking it alone, and I&#039;m looking for some advice for my first trip.

				I&#039;ve been doing a lot of research myself as I&#039;m looking to take my first trip soon.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you probably want to watch the documentary DMT:&nbsp; The Spirit Molecule (it&#039;s available chunked up on youtube or you can probably find a place to download it, megaupload/rapidshare etc.) and then hit up the DMT Nexus boards.&nbsp;

				srinkle some on a cone, try to burn it with as little heat as possible. the initial rush lasts about 2 minutes, then there are awesome visuals for about 10 minutes then body tingles for up to an hour.

				Tried some a week ago. First time was a fail, I tried an exotic way of evaporating by putting a can into boiling water. It didn&#039;t vaporated really good, so just got slightest visual distortions with no mind blowing. Next time tried the light bulb and that was it! It smoked really intensively and easy, and I could make about 3 full breaths before I knew another one will pass me out completely, then leaned back on a sofa and had a really intensive and scary experience. I am had many acid and 2c- trips before, but none could scare me this way. Anyway I considered it a good experience. <br />Be sure in your smoking method! One can waste most of the stuff with improper use.<br />Have someone to take a smoking device from you, or have it stand at something like a table or a chair. First time you would probably forget about it and leave in your hand. It may cause some trouble.<br />Try to open your while tripping. There is an opinion that DMT is a closed eyed substance, but sometimes open eyed visuals are even cooler.<br />You can be vague in dosing and measure the dose by full breaths (about 2-3, held for as long as possible), but remember that there may be lots of material left unsmoked, especially first time, when you don&#039;t quite feel the substance behavior.<br /><br />If someone tell me some tor image sharing site, I&#039;ll upload some photos of my smoking device, which I found the most efficient and easy to make yourself.

				I&#039;ve been smoking D for a while (10 years plus). So I think I can help here. But some background is necessary. I have a good friend that couldnt hit the pure. Psychological. Scared of the glass. There is something deep within us that affects this. Calm. Silent Dark. Self. This is a personal thing, a calm center which affects things. I would recomend somewhere safe and silent - a&nbsp; bed, a pillow room, somewhere you feel aware but at the same time sleepy. This is the drug of dreams. Relax man. Intention. I know this doesnt make sense now but it will. I love how these tryptamines change people.....<br /><br />Discord,<br />DiMiTri <br />

				if your new and you want full effects you cannot go past smoking a bucket if your lungs can handle it.<br />Its fool proof.<br />And do it yourself. You dont want your mates hanging around laughing and poking you :o ::)which seems to happen too much these days.<br />
