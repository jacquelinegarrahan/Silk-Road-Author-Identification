				well, I think that it has to do a quite bit with taking advantage of the fiends, but I think it also has to do with risk. Meth has been a really high profile drug for the last few years in the non-drug community and LE, which makes it more risky. Also meth itself is often a sketchy drug to make, sell, buy and use, all the way from the cook to the end user. I won&#039;t sell it as it is, even with good money, and I certainly wouldn&#039;t do so for less than good money. I&nbsp; dunno.. just my stoned 2 cents 8)

				I really don&#039;t think it is that expensive.&nbsp; Is it that expensive?&nbsp; for the casual user a gram can last days.&nbsp; Wish I could say the same for other drugs.&nbsp; even hundred bucks a day isn&#039;t bad for a habit is it?&nbsp; a lot of the wares here are worth the extra coin, compared to local flavors.&nbsp;

				I dunno, I think meth is pretty cheap - especially compared to similar drugs like cocaine. Not only that, it&#039;s effective in smaller doses (than coke) and the high lasts longer. It&#039;s a different high to be sure, but it lasts a lot longer.<br /><br />Take an 8ball (3.5 grams) for example. On the street they both go for around $200 or so. Once you start doing coke regularly you can go through an 8ball in a few days, no problem. An 8ball of meth, on the other hand, will last your average tweaker at least a couple of weeks (unless of course he gets into slamming, in which case all bets are off).<br /><br />The prices of course vary dramatically depending on who you get it from and how closely connected they are to the sources (importers for coke, cooks for meth). A good rule of thumb that holds pretty well is that the price of a drug doubles for each set of hands it passes through between maker and user.

				I don&#039;t believe methamphetamine is all that expensive, especially here on Silk Road, where the quality is extremely high, compared to street prices and quality.<br /><br />Compared to cocaine here on Silk Road, meth lasts a lot longer, and costs a lot less, and vendors here are very professional and reasonable, often to a fault.<br /><br />In my area, at least, meth on Silk Road is comparable to vitamins at the drug store in terms of cost.

				I believe the price is so high simply because of dealers exploiting its potential for addiction - most street users will do anything for another hit.<br /><br />possibly also due to over the counter ephedrine sales being illegal - one needs a doctors prescription

				Yeah you guys in Australia are getting raped on meth prices, Dude if you guys haven&#039;t seen Kush411 is offering some sick prices shipping to Australia and I think Hammertime does too and both those vendors are shipping and communicating masters, i&#039;ve done alot of business with both and can vouch for their no bullshit get product with excellent stealth out the door and to you in no time, no waiting around and a thousand excuses. I think prices in Australia have got to be due to lack of competition, I mean here in the states you probably have 1000&#039;s of times more dealers so with more competition comes lower prices.&nbsp; I would be bankrupt if i lived in australia and tried to keep my same party habit which is pretty moderate here but would bankrupt a normal person over there probably

				The ausfailian meth listings on sr speak for themselves, i&#039;ve asked the vendors why they charge so much when they get it so cheap and the answer is the exact same every time - &quot;We take the risk of importing it so the price is justified&quot; - whatever.

				I had just written up exactly what you wrote up(links and all!) fallkniven&nbsp; :o.&nbsp; I got the &quot;A new message has been posted&quot; warning and aforementioned face ensued.<br /><br />The situation with meth prices in Australia is pretty absurd, especially given that Australia used to be one of the biggest meth countries in the world.&nbsp; The excuse in regards to risk, difficulties cooking, and using are equally absurd.&nbsp; Meth is widely renown for being one of the easiest drugs to synth, any idiot who learned what refluxing is in high school chemistry could do it and produce decent quantities of clean meth.&nbsp; Whilst the risk involved in taking meth is relatively high both on the legal side, and addiction, there are many substances that have it beaten in spades.&nbsp; Heroin for example.<br /><br />I&#039;m of the opinion that the price is a result of the method of action, meth tends to lead to productivity.(Even if it is self-destructive in some cases)&nbsp; Productive people tend to have more money, people with money can pay higher prices than the broke smack addict on the street, therefore, meth prices rise.&nbsp; I admit I don&#039;t have much evidence to back it up, and evidence to the contrary does exist, however its the best answer I can come up with.<br /><br />

				I was thinking you were talking about local prices, International shipping is a different story. And while those prices sound horrific, that&#039;s a cost imposed due to the higher rate of package interception Auz customs is apparently famous for. But for the tiny amounts like a point, you gotta realize that a good chunk of the cost is going to be for the stealth packaging (which I&#039;m sure for Oz has to be really creative to have any hope of getting through.<br /><br />But since they do confiscate more shipments there than in other countries, any vendor who ships there (and will be stuck eating part of the cost on any orders stolen by the gov&#039;t),&nbsp; would be wise to add a &quot;risk premium&quot; to the cost to compensate for the increased likelihood of taking a loss. That&#039;s just good business sense which is, unfortunately, necessitated by the over-aggressive customs piggy-wiggies. Kinda like how stores in high crime areas with lots of shoplifters tend to charge higher prices.<br /><br />I feel bad for ya man, cuz it&#039;s a shitty deal for you no matter which way you slice it.&nbsp; :( I gotta say I wouldn&#039;t be willing to gather up a large chunk of coin just for one little point. Maybe if it&#039;s someone who only wants it for some super special occasion - but it sure couldn&#039;t be a habit.

				I just looked closer at your price listings and realized they are all Australian vendors!&nbsp; :o<br />That&#039;s absolutely psychotic and my point about risk premiums was completely irrelevant since they are not shipping thru customs. Screwing their own countrymen they are with those prices! I wouldn&#039;t go waltzing with those Matildas if I were you - look here:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/fd1c02a45a - 3.5 grams, Australia only 23.70 BTC (about $117/gram depending what BTC is these days)<br /><br />Yes it&#039;s Kush411&nbsp; :P I swear I&#039;m not getting kickbacks from the dude!

				I agree, it is simply that people will pay that much for it.&nbsp; &nbsp; That is why anything is high, cell phones,&nbsp; fine dining,&nbsp; jewelery.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />When u have a base of user&#039;s that will steal from there grandma&#039;s to get a hit, or break in to someones house,&nbsp; then what price is to high?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />When a cheaper drug that does the same thing comes out then prices will drop.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally I have never tried meth, and it seems dirty to me,&nbsp; the chemicals that go in it, I would not want in my body.&nbsp; But to each their own.&nbsp; &nbsp;As long as it doesn&#039;t get control over u.&nbsp; ( which is that even possible to keep ur head? )&nbsp; &nbsp;I really don&#039;t know.
