				So who has been following the News International scandal then? And who thinks that Murdoch is just a great big dirty corrupt little SHISTER!?<br /><br />Whilst I am no fan of the CPS I am happy that the corrupt bitch and the Murdoch shister factory is finally getting a bite taken out of it. The way that Murdoch controls how people think is pretty bloody disgusting by all accounts and it pisses me off that he is slowly turning The Times (my paper of choice) bad. Pisses me off that that there there wont be an honest opinion left in it soon and it pisses me off more that it means that I&#039;ll have to switch to a different newspaper because I like the dry tone of The Times. I&#039;m being fucking robbed of my intellectual stimulus. <br /><br />Anyway to summarize - <br /><br />Fuck you Rupert Murdoch, the MPs weren&#039;t wrong when they said you weren&#039;t fit to run an international corporation. You are just a cunt in a suit. You deserve a damn good striping.<br /><br />Fuck you Rebekah Brookes with your privacy invading tactics that disclose peoples information and who the fuck were you to delete Millie Dowlers voicemail messages. How fucking sick can you get you dirty degenerate ginger slag? You deserve to be striped so you turn the same colour as your frizzy barnet. <br /><br />Fuck you The Sun and the rest of your tabloid bullshit type papers that serve up intellectual dog shit and make millions off it. <br /><br />And most of all FUCK YOU British government for letting them get away with all this shit for so long and cosying up to Murdoch for so long. You make me sick carrots. <br /><br />Slags.

				Whilst I agree that Murdoch is an idiot I think that what&#039;s playing out here is a power war between to powerful parties, who are both equally evil. Nothing will change, people need a certain percentage of brainwashing otherwise society becomes out of control and unproductive.<br /><br />The only place you can get an honest opinion nowadays (in print) in the UK is the Economist magazine. They always present a balanced point of view with arguments for and against with no brainwashing. Pretty good reading actually.<br /><br />OZ.

				What&#039;s the similarity between Rupert Murdoch and Mike Tyson&#039;s daughter?<br /><br />They both got fucked by cable.<br /><br />Sick, I know, but I couldn&#039;t help but laugh.

				I think Murdoch is the ultimate proof that elected politicians CANT DO SHIT for their country. <br />The entire world is being led by massive corporations and citizens get a chance at voting every 3/4/5/6 years to think they can decide what happens and stay calm. <br />

				Yeah don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m not a conspiracy theorist at all and neither do I on-the-whole object to corporate culture and I&#039;m not opposed to capitalism at all lol, in fact quite the reverse. I&#039;m not at all left wing in my politics and slightly right of center but in a libertarian way.<br /><br />What does piss me off though is when Corporations overstep the mark like New Corp has and it&#039;s damaging to the individual. Yeah, you should be able to earn a lot of cheddar because they feed it back into the tax system blah blah BUT you have to do it in an honest way and it&#039;s the politician&#039;s job to keep that shit in check. <br /><br />So what I am saying is FUCK all the people who aren&#039;t even doing what they supposedly claim to be employed to do. THIS IS WHY I DON&#039;T PAY TAX. <br /><br />Oh and again, fuck you Rebekah Brookes for being a degenerate ginger&#039;un.

				Although i agree the Economist is a good read, it is a hell of alot to get through in a week, i cancelled my subscription because i just wasn&#039;t finding time to read it all. I don&#039;t think its completely balanced, it defiantly has a right wing leaning, but non the less i do think it is a very detailed, intelligent, believable read.<br /><br />Personally if im going to read a daily paper i always read the Independent, or if its not available the Guardian (though i&#039;ve gone off it over the last few years). But unfortunately the prosecution of Brooks isn&#039;t going to improve the quality or bias of the News International papers =/ i never read them but seeing as the Sun is the most bought paper in the UK it would be nice if it improved in quality.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think its that the government want to &#039;take power&#039; back from the media at all, the reason they are having to push is they are low on ratings and the public are furious with all the phone hacking so they don&#039;t really have a choice but to go after some scalps. The conservative party have an historically strong relationship with News International and their papers normally back the Tories (ignoring Blair&#039;s New Labour) so they almost certainly have no desire to upset News International. Also the whole scandal hasn&#039;t done a great deal to dent the Sun&#039;s readership (News Internationals flagship UK paper) so they still have a decent amount of influence with the British public.<br /><br />Oh finally in response to the comment about elected politicians not being able to do shit because of the media accountability. Yea this is a huge problem, but it&#039;s not that politicians can&#039;t do anything, its that they wont risk doing the right thing but loosing power. Once they are elected provided they have a decent majority they can do anything they like for 5 years, that is alot of time to make alot of good decisions. The issue comes because no government is willing to risk not being able to govern, for the &#039;greater good&#039;. Its the age old question of &#039;would you rather stick up for you beliefs and have no influence, or abandon them and have influence&#039;. But what is the alternative ? 10 year terms ? thats an awful long time to be stuck with a government, what if they start making changes the public object to, they can&#039;t remove them til the term is up short of a mass political uprising. Restrict the press so they can&#039;t put a negative spin on political decision? but this is a complete removal of freedom of speech, and any government that implemented the policy would probably get thrown out at the next election for making such a piece of legislation.

				None of the &#039;isms&#039; work and folk are fucked. Hence the popularity of drugs. To be wildly generalist, the media aren&#039;t there to inform but to instruct.

Murdoch&#039;s shit is basically the backbone of ignorance in America. Watching FoxNews, the most viewed news channel in the U.S., is the equivalent of having two people with diarrhea shit in each ear and making sense out of it. What&#039;s worse, viewers award more credibility to FoxNews than say... a fucking history book. FUCK.
