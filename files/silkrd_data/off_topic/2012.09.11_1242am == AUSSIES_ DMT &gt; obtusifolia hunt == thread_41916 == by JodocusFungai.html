				Hey guys<br />I&#039;m looking for help finding Acc. Obt.<br /><br />I&#039;ve always felt weird paying for DMT as it&#039;s (theoretically) available free on every continent. I believe that it should be sold at cost if at all so that more people can try it.<br /><br />The only problem is I live in an area which must be at least a few hours from the closest grove of obtusifolia. Though I don&#039;t know where that might be.<br />My next step would be to just drive through gippsland and the east coast during nov and look for flowers - but that&#039;s also a pretty bad plan...<br /><br />I would only take dead tree matter and not strip trees.<br /><br />Can anyone help?<br /><br />

				I must confess being rather stale with respect to DMT extraction from Australian native flora, but is there any particular reason you&#039;re after obtusifolia specifically? There are dozens of Australian wattle that carry DMT, and some of them grow in massive abundance to the extent that harvesting bark from native plants would not present a problem for the local ecosystem.<br />Acacias in general are not terribly long lived, but their tradeoff is that they produce vast numbers of seeds, and so they ensure their continued existence through propagating profusely. Provided you&#039;re not intending a commercial scale extraction you&#039;d be hard pressed to injure a local population of acacia by removing bark from living trees. You don&#039;t need to kill a tree to harvest a useable quantity of bark, either.<br /><br />But I&#039;m curious about whether something peculiar to obtusifolia has been discovered since I stopped investigating DMT in Australian flora.

				I investigated the fuck out of this a while ago and from what I learned:<br /><br />1. Maidenii and Obtusifolia are the ones most often used for extraction. M is more common but with lower yield. O having the largest yield of any source in Australia.<br /><br />2. Never just remove bark from a living tree as this opens it up to infection. Stripping a little bark of many trees can lead to the death of an entire grove.<br /><br />I would only be doing it for myself but I think I&#039;d need a few kilos at least, for failed extractions and making the long drive worthwhile.<br /><br />EDIT: I know this is extremely problematic. I&#039;d volunteer to go with someone and help them with a batch first but I guess there&#039;s no telling who anyone is here. <br />And while someone could give me a general location I understand some people want to protect what they think is &#039;theirs&#039;. <br />
