				Heyho,<br /><br />i&#039;ve been looking through the storage listings when I saw this Magnetic Car Stash box from optiman (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/55d230e73c).<br />It says that the stash is&nbsp; air-tight (=no smell), so I thought smuggling weed within the EU with this stash might be a easy, safe way to get cheap &amp; good weed.<br />So do you think there are places in the EU where you can get high amounts of weed for ridiculous cheap prices without having any real connections, just by asking arround?<br />I was thinking of driving, when the outdoorgrows are finished, into a country with warmer climate like Italy or Spain and try to buy about 1-2 kg&#039;s of good outdoorweed.<br />If my idea is bullshit please tell me why, <br />otherwise I would be happy if someone could provide information about places which could be interesting for me and estimate an approximate price for 2 kg weed.<br /><br />This was just a spontaneously idea, I&#039;ve read that in Sicily for example there are markets where you can buy a kg for 500€ after the outdoorgrows are finished...<br /><br />Please share your thoughts :)

				seems kind of a high price to pay for a small pelican case with two large magnets - they probably are a good vapor tight case but it wouldn&#039;t hurt to use some silicone grease on the gasket to help further seal it<br /><br />but even the small pelican cases would stand out like a turd in a swimming pool, under a car<br /><br />you&#039;d be smarter to have a mechanic weld you up a 2nd exhaust pipe to run parrell to the real one (lot of HP cars have dual exhaust lines)<br /><br />just my 02

				Nah, it shouldn&#039;t be a permanent storage on the car, I think you can hide this storage easily in a way it doesn&#039;t stand out.<br /><br />&quot;Most people go underneath to the inside frame area but we prefer to open the hood and find a flat metal surface around the fender areas, there are usually a lot of electrical units and air filters to put it behind and it just blends in better in our opinion and we have never had to open our hood during a traffic stop.<br />We do not recommend placing the box where there is undercoating on the bottom of your vehicle.<br />A full metal contact works the best and you can also use this box in your home - Put it behind a washer or dryer, behind your refrigerator, on a filing cabinet.&quot;<br /><br />
