				Hey Everybody, Just seeing what kind of stuff you all like to do when you have some of that GOOD cocaine?<br /><br />I enjoy getting friends together and picking up an 8Ball and making some cocktails, maybe some whiskey, gin, or vodka drinks, then sit around blowin lines and drinkin. Chattin the shit out of eachother. Talking our heads off. Especially when one of us has got some of that good good, like Studio54 or Bungee&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; Those are the best kind of nights.<br /><br />What you guys like to do when you got booger sugar?

Chattin the shit out of eachother. Talking our heads off. Especially when one of us has got some of that good good, like Studio54 or Bungee&#039;s stuff.&nbsp; Those are the best kind of nights.<br /><br />What you guys like to do when you got booger sugar?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have to agree, anytime I get some good coke, it&#039;s usually with a group of close friends and we just sit around drinking talking ENDLESSLY blowin lines like crazy.<br />We had a binge one night between 5 people, got about 2 balls. 7 grams, stayed up for 14 hours blowing lines and talking about some DEEP shit! lol<br /><br />I&#039;ve had some of the greatest convos/debates in my life under the influence of coke.<br /><br />I know you already know, when you get some good coke and a few friends, you NEVER KNOW where the conversation is gonna go. lol.<br />We talked about everything from politics to religion to racism to... well I don&#039;t remember what else, but It was always amazing! I miss the good ol days. :(<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />sounds like how me and my old crew use to hang out on friday nights and saturday nights rolling on MDMA, we would talk for hours and hours about everything, life, religion ...deep deep conversations that would last until noon the next day.. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know, I miss those days.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=187046.msg1367825#msg1367825">Quote from: baranliam on July 23, 2013, 09:55 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">CALL OF FUCKIN DUTY!!!! <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have never tried playing any games while coked out, but I&#039;ve always been with a crew of people, so we wouldn&#039;t turn it on. Hell we never even watched anything. <br /><br />I do want to try this now though. the CAPS make it seem legit, lmfao ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />FTW!!!
