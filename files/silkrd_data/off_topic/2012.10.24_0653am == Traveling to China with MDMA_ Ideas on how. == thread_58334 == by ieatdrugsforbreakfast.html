				I&#039;m looking for some ideas on bringing a little MDMA to some friends in China. I was thinking about swallowing a balloon with a couple grams but I&#039;m not sure that would be the best way. The flight with layovers depending on airline can take up to 30 hours. I feel like the acids in my stomach may effect the balloon? There is no way in hell I&#039;m shoving it in my ass so that&#039;s out. <br />And I go through about 4 security checks along the way.<br /><br />I thought about getting some shipped there but with the lax drug laws in China.... I&#039;m not trying to get shot.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyone have any ideas here? <br />Worst comes to worst, they don&#039;t get any... <br /><br />Thanks <br />

				I traveled from the US to China with 60 adderall pills in a prescription pill bottle in my backpack without any problem. A bag of powder might be different, though. Shipping has not been a problem.

				smuggling drugs through airports especially international ones is not a good idea. Simply not worth the risk. If anything I would rather ship it there or order from a vendor and have it shipped there.

				Yeah come to think of it... In the many times I&#039;ve been there not once have they looked in a prescription bottle... Still way too risky though I think. <br /><br />As for shipping, I could see it going fine to Hong Kong or Taiwan but I&#039;ll be in the Peoples Republic. I know shipping out of there is a bitch. You have to package your shit at the post office in front of someone. I&#039;m not 100% about incoming mail?<br /><br />Too bad the crystals are so easy to break... I know a diamond cutter. (It would be the best candy bracelet ever)!!&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Is there anyone out there from the China mainland that has received packages? Or any vendors that have shipped there without any problems? <br /><br />

				Every time I&#039;ve taken stuff through the airport I&#039;ve just put it in a prescription bottle and I&#039;ve never had an issue.. still really risky for something non-prescription.

				Had a friend travel to Asia with MDMA caps mixed in with vitamins in a bottle. Apparently worked out fine. But you&#039;re right about PRC being a different kettle of fish. Best to stay safe and roll when they visit you imho.

				Call the embassy ahead of time and inform them of your importation for personal use and the ambassador will set up a security team for you to bypass all check points.

				Oh that&#039;s the worst idea i have ever heard.. Just ship it in the mail as everyone do here.. If you are caught in china you will learn the hard way that their jails are stupidly overcrowd.. you will end in a small cell with maybe 15-20 other criminals. Also they have stupid rules to break you, by example you can&#039;t talk to anyone in the cell or things like that. I have seen those jails in a documentary and trust me you don&#039;t want to end there ! Their cops are corrupted assholes too, they can jail you without being guilty at all.. if you are caught with one gram of mdma they can say you have been caught with 25 grams.. They don&#039;t care if this true or not !

				@tonedef I wish I had a beard that awesome!! That&#039;s not me!!<br /><br />@cindelle I think the acids in my stomach would cause problems for such a long trip from point a to point b<br /><br />@Scampony .........&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I think I came up with a way that&#039;s less risky with one of the forged RX labels sold here and a friends prescription but when it all comes down to it... I think misirlou is right. Chinese prison is nothing like the prisons here. Prison here would be like a 5 star hotel in comparison... <br /><br />If they want a shipment I&#039;ll find them a vendor that will ship a small amount over there. <br /><br />Thanks again for chiming in!!

				I would never take the risk with international, but when i flew cross country i bought a bottle of &quot;nature made&quot; vitamin capsules and they worked out perfect because the vitamins inside are brown/tan just like the mdma i filled them with. I filled 10 large capsules with mdma (4 grams) and left 90 of them in their original form and left the ones filled with mdma near the bottom.

				I agree with the capsule idea for powders, as it has worked for me. Then again, I was not traveling to China.<br /><br />I suggest looking for a vendor that has had successful shipping before taking the risk.
