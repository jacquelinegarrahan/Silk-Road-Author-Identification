				I just received a pm from silk road. I guess someone complained to them that I was 1. selling norcos and oxy&#039;s and 2. The only way to accept payment was by money order (lol) 3. they had to release funds before it was sent. <br /><br />SR was just asking me what the deal was.<br /><br />1. I don&#039;t sell norcos. 2. I don&#039;t bypass SR systems 3. The pre-release are for people that trust me and that have done business with me in the past (and for larger orders) I have a listing for those doing it the old fashioned way. I don&#039;t know if the complaining individual can even read or tried to read it.<br /><br />I wish people would read and get their facts straight before complaining to someone, Im glad I have a good idea who it was so I know for a fact I wont sell to them...EVER!!!<br /><br />This person wanted to do business with me but thought I was a scam..Why wouldn&#039;t he come to me with his concerns? I could have easily showed him the regular listing (right underneath the other one) I guess people are quick to judge and what not.. All of my orders as of today have showed up and I have only had glowing reviews and in fact, someone pm&#039;ed me today saying that I was the greatest. (he just received his order) <br /><br />Why cant people read!!!

				Well - just keep you cool head. Ignore it. Present and explain issue to SR admin and that is it. That is solely provocation and goal is only to upset you.<br />I also have received (outside sr) many threats and insults from arogant person who just wanted something up front/and my real info and could not handle when I refused him.

				You don&#039;t want to sell to someone that is that quick to run to SR and complain anyway. Guess what the first thing that person will do if they are busted?

				The problem with F2F and a big reason to sell here is no one here can ID you. If one of your custys get busted from a F2F deal, unless he is a super good friend, your going down with him. Its one of the main reasons to sell here. And if you quit cause of one retard then he wins and gets exactly what he was after.&nbsp; Seriously though packing it in after one complaint...not going to last long...he may have been the first but def. not going to be the last. Im just a little confused on how he could complain that you were selling drugs ie: oxy..isnt that the whole point to be here.

				It&#039;s not just the one thing. Its the accumulative that im pissed about. Your right, I wouldn&#039;t pack it with one idiot. its the 1k things piled up and having a bad day is what brought out my frustrations.<br /><br />The funny thing is, is that I started selling so that I could get some bitcoin to purchase something that I wanted. I never had any intention of doing what I am doing now,lol.. Trust me, it&#039;s a lot harder physically and emotionally than I thought.<br /><br />I did some deep breathing and I let out the bad and I breathed in the good....<br /><br />Edit: he complained to SR that I was selling norco (which is false) and oxy (true) but i wanted to get paid with a money order (false) or directly. While I have a listing where the buyer can purchase as many as he wishes but he has to release funds before it being sent. I have another listing that uses escrow 100 percent. they dont pay until they receive. I have a limit on how many i send. 95 percent of the members that release their btc&#039;s early to me are repeat customers. I would never expect anyone to do that without knowing me, etc. he just assumed that&nbsp; had one listing and was trying to rip people off. If he bothered to read the listings, he would have figured out why i have the two.. I think its a great option for those that trust me. I dont put a gun to anyones head or force them to do anything.

				Yep, I did...<br /><br />To top off my day, I get a pm saying this<br /><br />&quot;just wanted to let you know that you revealed the username of yor customer, and his location to the public and law enforcement.<br />NOT COOL!&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;WHAT THE HELL???!!!!I would l like anyone to point out ANYWHERE that I mentioned anyone or any location specificly!!! I have never mentioned any ones name/ location, etc. ESPECIALLY CUSTOMERS!!<br /><br />I can only assume that this person has me mistaken for someone else..GOOD GRIEF! I need a xanax!!

				I started reading your first post and thought &quot;this is weird, I&#039;m sure CronicPain uses escrow.&quot;&nbsp; If a seller who I have never dealt with before asked me to go outside escrow or finalize early, I&#039;d say no.&nbsp; But then again it is suggested to start with small purchases when you don&#039;t know each other to establish trust.&nbsp; People seem to forget that these days.

				I do use escrow. One of my listings still went thru SR but they had to finalize early. It was for bigger orders and i gave a better price. Most of the customers were repeat customers, so they trust me. It was working pretty good too. I got my btc fast and the customer got a little better price and could buy as many as i had available.<br /><br />What I think ill do from now on is still offer it but only to established clients..

				You should do what tetravort kinda does...Have them Pm with what they want and just put up a custom listing for that person...that way everyone is on the same page and it doesnt involve anyone but you and that customer...noone can bitch about that...sounds like someone is pissed off at you or had u confused with someone else...maybe u pissed off someone that is selling the same thing with higher prices....

				Dude, great idea!! Great point to! When I looked at the persons number it was very very high, like it was made recently. So, you may be right, someone may be mad that im a bit cheaper for a similar product. Guess, Ill be raising my prices now!!! (joke)

				Yea a .01 BTC listing with instructions and price that way its up there and you dont have to worry about people not putting in atleast 4 and all they have to do is buy thier custom listing after you post it. Will cut down on people not following instructions too.&nbsp; Or something like that...

				yeah unless you work full time and have to process 30 orders a week - it can get redundent constantly putting up listings and figuring out current BTC exchange rates.<br /><br />Plus customers checking the &quot;item&quot; link in feedback will have no idea what that person bought unless they specifically mention it in their feedback note.<br /><br />This is why I list my items the way I do with the quantity I have on hand - I know the price I am getting (pegged to USD) and I also know how much I have to sell of each quantity/strain.&nbsp; That is just too much of a pain in the ass for me.
