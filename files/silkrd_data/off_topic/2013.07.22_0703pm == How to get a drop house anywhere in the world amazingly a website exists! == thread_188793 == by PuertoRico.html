				couchsurfing.com ! Simply pick an unsuspecting friendly traveller type hippie dude who&#039;s couch you can use. Make a fake account safely and befriend him/her. This could be in any country in the world or just down the road from where you live, depending on the package contents and its further use. <br /><br />Once you arrive at your victims house, order away wait there until it comes and fuck right off! Or it may go well and you end up with a long lasting traveller friend who may or may not be able to ever know your true identity, phone number, facebook but fuck it. You can still be nice. <br /><br />I think I could easily tell some dude who lives an hour away from me that im travelling back from SE Asia my parents are in AUS and I need to sleep on his sofa for two weeks. In return i&#039;ll do the shopping, i&#039;ll wash up (this never happens you just say that then do fuck all) put in some money for food. Then order 100g&#039;s of mandy to the house, if it goes wrong, disappear. If not boom, free holiday, new friend, nice little experience of living in the life of a randomer and you got your shit. <br /><br />Seems legit to me. Slightly more dishonest than my normal ones but great deeniability especially if you are using domestic vendors with tracking. Just say your bags got lost at the airport and they are sending them to you or some bullshit. <br /><br />Thoughts?

				travel expenses and cost of food and other things you need while you&#039;re there is going to have to be factored into the cost of the shipping. its gonna make the price of your drugs sky high.

				Thoughts? Well a) you are a dickhead,<br /><br />and b) while I found your idea amusing, the site is called &quot;couchsurfing.com&quot; not &quot;totalfuckingsuckers.com&quot; . They might be hippys but I doubt they are that stupid. I&#039;m sure they require pretty solid ID and securities before you are allowed to go and stay in strangers homes. Y&#039;know in case you decide to burgle them or order massive quantities of illegal drugs in their name. Of course maybe you have rock solid fake identities, but in that case there are much easier ways of acquiring a drop than this charade.<br />Plus, I reckon the traveller types are pretty clued up about drugs and shit. So your &quot;oh great my eBay orders arrived, let me just leave immediately without opening it&quot; act is going to fall pretty flat. If you tried it at my house I would rob your drugs and burn all your clothes while you were in the shower, then kick you out. And report you to couch surfers.com

				Two additional thoughts.<br /><br />1) look for older people on the site, they probably just want a friend and wont be too hard to pull a fake ID on or get stuff shipped to them.<br /><br />2) reverse the idea, put your house on the site and whenever someone stays there order your drugs, then if you get busted...plausible deniablility...The courts will believe the loner couch-hopper ordered it to the house, not the homeowner ordering drugs to his own house...reverse psychology <br /><br />If you ever got CD&#039;d keep your mouth shut and any lawyer could point the finger at the drifter.

				Please don&#039;t do this with untested vendors, or vendors that demand an early finalization. You might not come out of this unscathed. Your clearnet trail will lead straight back to you if you do not do everything, and I mean everything, perfectly.

				Aside from being unethical, this is an extremely foolish idea. Any investigator could easily trace every step of this process if you were to become a target. You use the website, which implies you use the internet, which implies numerous ways you&#039;ve left a traceable digital fingerprint all over the place. Take that in combination with all of the traces you&#039;ve left at this person&#039;s home like fingerprints, that photo of you on the surveillance camera at the gas station where you got the soda that one night, etc. and only a fool would think he could pull this off.<br /><br />On the other hand, thanks for posting these bright ideas because it helps me sleep well at night.

				Maybe I&#039;m just tired but I don&#039;t even get how it would work, <br />Plan A. <br />So you will have the package sent in your name to the hosts house, In most countries do you not have to register your name to the address before it will be delivered there?? <br />Anyway besides that obvious sticking point, I know people who host and used to share a house where my roommate had about 50 couch-surfers come and go, Never did they stay more than 3/4 nights and never did anyone have their mail redirected to our place so wouldn&#039;t take long to figure out. <br /><br />Plan B. You send mail to the host in their name, You planning to just sit at the mailbox all day? In any case if a controlled delivery was carried out, you would be a suspect and when your story of why you&#039;re there 20K from your real home gets found out it&#039;s game over again.<br /><br />Leave couchsurfing for the chance of casual sex in return for a place to sleep for which it was designed

				Having been a couchsurfer for several years, I can guarantee you&#039;ll be just setting yourself up for failure with this plan.<br /><br />For one thing, it&#039;s not generally that simple to get a host.&nbsp; Most hosts are inundated with requests and only take on a tiny percentage of those.&nbsp; Many hosts will only want people with a string of positive reviews from other hosts, as well as lots of photographs showing their potential guest&#039;s travels.&nbsp; You&#039;ll usually need to do some emailing back and forth, and perhaps even a Skype hookup, to ensure you&#039;ll be a match.&nbsp; Nearly all hosts have a finely-honed bullshit detector when accepting guests into their homes. A lot will ask for a passport or other ID when you arrive and many won&#039;t accept travellers from their home country.&nbsp; And the usual deal is 2-3 days in one host&#039;s home, though this will often be extended if you get along.<br /><br />And there&#039;s no way of knowing what the mail collection deal is at a particular house.&nbsp; For example, my letterbox has a lock on it and I work from home, so will always be there to collect the mail.&nbsp; My surfers go out and do traveller stuff during the day - it would be pretty weird for one to be hanging around waiting for the mail to be delivered.&nbsp; And it would be highly unusual to receive mail for a surfer, who by their very nature are transient folk.<br /><br />All in all, it seems like a lot of work for a VERY uncertain outcome ::)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188793.msg1373896#msg1373896">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on July 25, 2013, 03:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=188793.msg1373222#msg1373222">Quote from: ananas_xpress on July 24, 2013, 11:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Leave couchsurfing for the chance of casual sex in return for a place to sleep for which it was designed<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So that is what it was designed for. ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Then again, maybe I&#039;ve been doing it wrong :D

Any investigator could easily trace every step of this process if you were to become a target. You use the website, which implies you use the internet, which implies numerous ways you&#039;ve left a traceable digital fingerprint all over the place. Take that in combination with all of the traces you&#039;ve left at this person&#039;s home like fingerprints, that photo of you on the surveillance camera at the gas station where you got the soda that one night, etc. and only a fool would think he could pull this off.<br /><br />On the other hand, thanks for posting these bright ideas because it helps me sleep well at night.
