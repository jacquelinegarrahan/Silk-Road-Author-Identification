				Evangelist Christians doing doggy style right now and the woman liking it- definitely maybe<br />a muslima allowed to take her full robe burka off during sex right now - possible<br />a Catholic priest hearing the wicked sins of little boys in his congregation - absolutely devilishly true<br />nuns in the catholic charge in garters and fishnets - only the priest will know<br /><br />

				the amount of pork being eaten in muslim countries - definately not<br />the amount of cap wearing muslims in the united states - one less<br />the amount of pressure cooker imports arriving from pakistan into the us - immense from last week<br />the amount of bullets required to prevent these cookers being used other than to cook pork - never enough
