				Just wondering what your current favorite TV show is :D<br /><br />Mine is Mad Men, I just love the eye for detail the show has and it has a cool storyline &amp; characters. <br />Sucks that since last night I have caught up with the broadcasts and have to wait a week for new episode :(<br />

				I generally like to wait until the seasons come out on DVD, enjoy watching them back to back rather than having 1 or 2 weeks between episodes, I smoke way too much weed to follow story lines with week-long gaps between them.<br /><br />Recently just watched all 4 seasons of Breaking Bad, excellent show, maybe my favorite tv series since Sopranos was good.<br /><br />Other than that the only one I&#039;ve been keeping up on is Game of Thrones, soon as I think I&#039;ve lost interest it sucks me in again.

				Doctor Who, hands down. Its commentary on society, both past and present(but in future settings) is freaking amazing. OH, and David Tennant is probably one of the best actors on the face of the planet! Too bad he left after season 4&nbsp; :&#039;(

				Well I finished watching all 11 seasons of Cheers last week, which is still my favorite show of all time, but my favorite show I&#039;m currently watching is Frasier. I just made it to season 7 again last night. It&#039;s bloody fucking hilarious if you ask me. ;D

Have you ever watched Becker? It&#039;s sort of on the same page as Cheers and Frasier, but a bit more pissed off, and stars Ted Danson so you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Eastbound &amp; Down is hilarious, season 1 especially, anyone who hasn&#039;t seen it definitely should.

				ohhh I really dislike Becker, can&#039;t stand the guy.. :P<br />Frasier is great too.<br /><br />About Breaking Bad, I have watched it, but I just can not take the main character serious... Only have to think about Malcolm In The Middle 8)<br /><br />Suits is starting again soon, it&#039;s something I can recommend anyone.. great series :D Too&nbsp; bad just 1 season so far

				As much as I hate to say it - Eastenders is my all time favourite&nbsp; ;D. Use to watch all the soaps with my Mum when I was younger with a cuppa and some chocolate digestives. Good times... 8) (Eastenders is a British soap opera for anyone who doesn&#039;t know)

				Rewatching The Prisoner (original series, trying out the Keth order) and Profit. You&#039;ve probably heard of the former, the later only aired four episodes in its day. Fucking amazing, if you like cold logical psychopaths at work (hes like the Francis Urqhart from House of Cards, except in the business world instead of politics).<br /><br />For anime, I&#039;ve been showing this girl Paranoia Agent. Not as amazing as I remember, but still good.

				Currently: <br />House M.D.<br />Breaking Bad<br />Supernatural<br /><br />I also love(d) Dexter, Prison Break, Scrubs, American Horror Story and The Walking Dead but they don&#039;t count as &quot;current favorites&quot;.<br /><br />I kinda feel like I&#039;d love every TV show if I&#039;d only give it a chance because I was majorly excited about every Show I&#039;ve listed at one time while a lot of people say they dislike them. The only popular show I really dislike is Big Bang Theory.

				TRAILER PARK BOYS! I forgot all about that one, god that series cracked my shit up, loved it from start to finish.<br /><br />Magic City is a new series that isn&#039;t bad, has some great tits in nearly every episode at least. Other than Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, there aren&#039;t a whole lot of still running series that I&#039;m interested in.<br /><br />My past favorites would include Rome, Entourage, Eastbound &amp; Down, Weeds (early seasons), Sopranos, Arrested Development, Oz, The Office, could just keep going...
