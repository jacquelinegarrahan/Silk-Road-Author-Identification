				I thought I&#039;d be fun to see what people are watching at the moment, and get a few recommendations on what to watch. It can be anything from TV Shows to Movies. <br /><br />At the moment I&#039;m re-watching Breaking Bad (Season 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4), Walking Dead (Season 1, 2 &amp; 3). And watching Shutter Island (amazing movie) <br /><br />What about you?<br /><br />Robin.

				Great topic. I&#039;m always looking for recommendations.<br /><br />I am re-watching Shameless (UK) now. And first time through, Downton Abbey Season 3.<br /><br />Currently/recently airing TV shows: Grimm, Elementary, Once Upon a Time, Revenge, Happy Endings, Castle.... Archer. <br />Smash is going to start up soon, I loved the first season.<br /><br />Watching off and on/downloading: The Wire, The IT Crowd, Luther.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how old you are and if you are into sci-fi/super powers (like No Ordinary Family), but I recommend Misfits. I did not like it at first but I gave it a chance and I think it&#039;s a great show.<br /><br />Most of those Shows are dramas if you couldn&#039;t tell, they&#039;re the best kind of show to get sucked into.

				Just finished rewatching The Sopranos for the first time since it aired. I&#039;m glad I waited so long, as I&#039;d forgotten a lot of it, and was impressed by how well it all held up, and overall what a great show it is.<br /><br />I&#039;m really pumped that Justified is back on. I love that show.<br /><br />I watched the first episode of Banshee, and liked it enough that I&#039;ll keep watching. Seems pretty dark and graphic, and looks like it has some promise.<br /><br />I love Bob&#039;s Burgers too. I&#039;d watch any show those guys put on.<br /><br />Other than that things are pretty slow imo until Game of Thrones comes back in March. I&#039;m thinking I might rewatch Six Feet Under, but it&#039;s still kind of fresh in my mind.<br /><br />A definite +1 for the recommendation for Misfits. The 4th season was a bit of a let down, but the cast of the first three season was exceptional, and it&#039;s truly one of the best written and constructed shows I&#039;ve ever seen. It&#039;s manic as a motherfucker, but when you get what its doing, it&#039;s almost amazing who well these guys have pulled it off. Definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

				Breaking Bad is by far the best show out there. Catch up before it comes back on this summer :)<br /><br />I&#039;m also watching White Collar to keep myself busy. Great show but sometimes I feel like it&#039;s the same every episode, but it does have a continuous storyline. It&#039;s more of a House or Law and Order kind of deal.<br /><br />As for movies, just saw Silver Linings Playbook and Les Miserables which were freaking amazing. They aren&#039;t movies I would usually watch but glad I gave them a chance.

				i think this show gets really harshly judged mainly because the first half of the first season at least was pretty shit but cougar town.. it&#039;s actually pretty funny to watch when you&#039;re stoned. i watched it when i was having a really bad trip once and getting insane visuals and it kinda pulled me out a bit. it feels so over acted and i don&#039;t know exactly what i mean by that.

				I watched the movie Limitless last night. I thought it was quite good, a bit better than I had imagined it would be. It is about an author suffering from writer&#039;s block who is introduced to a new &quot;wonder drug&quot; that increases intelligence.<br /><br />There is some very cool cinematography and the story is pretty good. There are certainly worse movies out there.

Yep, can&#039;t wait for season two! Just for my tastes, I still like Mistfits just a little better. It was so audacious what they were going for with that show, and yet they pulled it off so well, it still blows my mind (especially those first 3 seasons). But it&#039;s like comparing your children (in a sense I guess). Utopia was fucking great. So much to love about the show. LOVED that they shot it in a cinema aspect ratio, instead of the typical 16:9 WS ratio typically used for TV. I gotta agree with you about episode count. Ideally the creators would get the exact amount of episodes they need to tell their story, not more not less. Utopia was as tight as a drum there. Totally agree about Meil Maskell. He really stole every scene he was in. I also really liked Adeel Akhtar, thought he was great, as well as the two child actors.<br /><br />tbh I have very little interest in conspiracy theory stuff irl, but the basic message of the show, expressed by Wilson in the email scene in the van with Ian, is just so exceptionally important to modern life, and this show did such an amazing job of playing with the very real and pressing issue of our stewardship of the planet, how fragile it is and how all our lives are dependent on the planet, ya know that core idea of the show. In addition to the show being just really well written, well acted, beautifully shot, and oozing creativity, it really is an exceptional piece of work.<br /><br />Ya man, I really loved it. Now, I&#039;m going to forget that there&#039;s a second season coming, and be totally blissed out in a year or whatever when I see second season eps start showing up on my torrent sites.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Also, was it just me, or did this show make you want to scrounge around your apartment for whatever art supplies you might have and do some drawing? lol The art in those panels from the unpublished graphic novel were so dark and cool!&nbsp; :D

I&#039;ll have to do a little internet stalking to see what interviews and such I can find from her. Sounds like it&#039;ll only make me like her more.<br /><br />As to American podcasts, there are some great ones. You&#039;ll have to recommend me some UK ones, as after the Ricky Gervais show I don&#039;t have a clue. Marc Maron&#039;s WTF is my personal favorite, absolutely the best for really great interviews with a whole range of comedians and other creative people. Doug Benson&#039;s Doug Loves Movies is my second favorite. Really hilarious live group shows. Those stand out to me personally, with a ton of other good one&#039;s bunched together depending on taste. Pete Holmes&#039; You Made it Weird is great but might not be for everybody because of his loud personality. You&#039;ll love Chris Hardwick&#039;s Nerdist podcast if you&#039;re into nerd culture. The Todd Glass show is like an insane variety hour, really funny but probably an acquired taste. The Pod F Tompcast is great, The Smartest Man in the World is worth checking out, as is Jonah Ray&#039;s newish podcast Joneh Raydio if you like to mix in music with your comedy. There&#039;s also some really popular ones that I just haven&#039;t gotten around to checking out, like Adam Carolla&#039;s and Joe Rogan&#039;s podcasts.<br /><br />Can you tell I&#039;m a fan of comedian&#039;s podcasts? lol</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

It&#039;s civil yet subversive in this way, which is a dynamic I really like. It also was my first introduction to Stephen Fry, who has become one of my favorite people.

I spent about a week there a couple years back. It was at the end of a long trip, my funds were down to like 30 pounds, and if it weren&#039;t for couchsurfing I would have had a rough go of it. London is such a beautiful city though, hopefully I&#039;ll get back over there sometime to explore the rest of the isle. There is a pretty marked difference between UK and American comedians, isn&#039;t there? I&#039;ve noticed that stand up comedy in the UK seems to often be more centered around longer stories and crowd work, whereas in the US it&#039;s more about playing with language, shorter bits and jokes. It&#039;s definitely easier for my to appreciate American stand ups, but I&#039;m trying to broaden my perspective by finding UK stuff online. UK comedians so rarely tour the US though, and it&#039;s a bit hard to really get a sense of a comedian unless you&#039;re able to see them perform live.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i&#039;ll have to get onto that movie, maybe tomorrow. if you liked it i probably will hah you can be the good taste barometer :) plus aubrey plaza &lt;3 can&#039;t go wrong<br />i&#039;m currently taking a break from an insane marathon of revenge with a bit of bones to lighten the tone. then bedtime i suppose, it&#039;s 4.30am here!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ya, let me know what you thought of it when you get a chance to watch it. Though I have little doubt you&#039;ll like it just as much as I did.&nbsp; ;)

				woahh i&#039;m kinda baked and i think you&#039;re some kind of genius because i can&#039;t quite understand what you said haha i want to like stephen fry but i don&#039;t get a lot of what he&#039;s on about, i&#039;m not much into science and trivia more politics and current affairs if we&#039;re going to be taking the piss out off anything. i will admire him from a distance without really being that into him like oscar wilde or robot hawkins or something. stephen fry was on bones as a psychiatrist though and he was really warm and likeable i can see why people love him. can you tell i love bones yet haha. <br />comedy panel shows give you good exposure to a lot of really good mainstream comedians stuff like mock the week, have i got news for you, 8 out of 10 cats(trivia!) and 10 o&#039;clock live is our weird attempt at exporting saturday night live...<br />our lot pretty much all do observational comedy, i know what you mean about the stories. you can see an alternative comedian taking the piss out of them, he gets it bang on it&#039;s funny but he&#039;s got a really unusual style.. some love him and others don&#039;t really get it. you can find the clip from his live show on youtube he&#039;s called stewart lee it&#039;ll be called observational comedy. i tried to watch robin williams stand up dvd having loved him in patch adams and mrs doubtfire since i was a kid and then he was swearing and talking about drugs it was so weird lol. ooohh you might like jack dee he&#039;s a cynical deadpan like april ludgate! he made a sitcom called lead balloon everyone said ripped off curb your enthusiasm. it wasn&#039;t great but his stand up is. if you like one liners and plays on language you might like lee mack, tim vine or the show they do called &#039;not going out&#039; and milton jones (i can&#039;t stand him).<br />ha you&#039;re not doing much with 30 quid especially in london! even 5 odd years ago that&#039;d be a night out at a stretch but you&#039;d have to have pre drinks if you were going out on the lash. i&#039;ve lived in greater london all my life except uni and a summer in a house share in central which was craaaaazy. i don&#039;t mind just watching the dvd stand up off torrents i&#039;m broke as a joke then i can get baked and fall asleep and it&#039;s fineee, saves traveling into central, paying anywhere between £10 and £50 for a ticket, usually around £30.. i have a love/hate relationship with the city. i&#039;m quite proud to be from london though it&#039;s got some great old architecture, awesome parks and shit, generally people are really tolerant and it&#039;s very multicultural. it&#039;s not friendly until everyone&#039;s shitfaced even then it could go either way haha. only other place i&#039;ve been so diverse is amsterdam but that&#039;s retained it&#039;s old fashioned charm a lot better than london has. such a different vibe over in mainland europe.

				Got some AAA+++ grade west German street Sativa (kinda smelled like Lemon Haze but &quot;different&quot;) with probably about 25% THC and near zero CBD after weeks of abstinence (zero tolerance). Watching Drawn Together and Parks And Recreation is the shit :D
