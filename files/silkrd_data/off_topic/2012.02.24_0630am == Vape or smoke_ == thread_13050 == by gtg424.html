				For all my weed-lovers out there, do you prefer to vaporize or smoke it?&nbsp; I personally prefer vaporization, got a Vapor Genie right now and it&#039;s awesome--I can get high off a much smaller amount than I would smoking so it saves me a ton of money.&nbsp; That said, I still like a joint every once in a while for the taste of the smoke.&nbsp;

				Vapor Genie for me as well! I love the convenience.. I can basically smoke anywhere.. house, car, without any smell. Also weed last super long (or maybe I just don&#039;t smoke enough).. Sorry I call vaping smoking as well because vaping sounds weird to me. I am definitely high right now.

				I like both, but I mainly smoke. <br /><br />I generally just take one hit at a time from my percolator bong. Awesome rips that really hit you hard in the head. Also just love that heavy chest expansion, sometimes even having to cough cause you really feel like you are smoking. Part of the reason I smoke weed is just cause I enjoy the act of smoking, esp since quitting cigs, and vaping just doesnt provide the same head high or fulfillment of &quot;smoking&quot; for some reason. I am a pyro so maybe thats why, I love the raw energy and beauty of the flame. The flavors are really good vaping but I actually feel I never get as stoned, just a relaxed mild body high which is nice. But then I still want to smoke again right after :)

				I recently got a DBV and I love it! I like the way the weed tastes, especially with my SR weed (street weed here just doesn&#039;t compare to some AAAA :) ).<br /><br />I heard it would save my weed, but now I just end up vaping loads. When smoking I have to hang out my window (dorm room, smoke alarm) but when vaping I can just chill and hit whenever I want rather than having to get my lazy ass off the couch =) So I just keep going!

				I finally got an ecig so no more pyros for me and I vaped my weed before. (now I need some of the budderman budder ecig magic, hehe)<br />Vaporizers are the most effective way to consume weed for me.

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but I&#039;ve heard the remains from a vaporizer can be used to make cannabutter.<br /><br />But yeah, that and the fact that vaping is stealthy and more efficient makes vaping seem like a much better option.<br /><br />I personally smoke though, because I enjoy rolling my own and can&#039;t be fucked to shell out the cash to buy a vaporizer.

				Depends on how I&#039;m feeling, but usually just smoke. Don&#039;t have anything other than my worked syn showercap, and it needs to see some use. When I get the VPG then I&#039;ll probably vape more.

				Seems like Stealthvape is not delivering product:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Folks, we apologize for the lack of timely updates. We had shipped a few units out before discovering an inefficiency in the bowls of some of the devices. This has had to be rectified at all costs. Our mission since the beginning has been to produce the best handheld vaporizer on the market, which sets the bar high. Our delays are a reflection of our tireless devotion to our customers because we adamantly refuse to ship a device that does not meet this high standard of quality. We have a deadline of a week and a half from today to stamp out any possible problems and to begin delivery of the devices to waiting customers. These delays stem from a retooling of our workshop, a reformulation of certain metal components, and the systematic testing of the new assembly and procedure. During this time we can provide answers to questions or concerns through the email address found on our website. We thank you for your patience.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>https://www.facebook.com/stealthvape<br />and<br />http://www.fuckcombustion.com/viewtopic.php?id=6886&amp;p=9

				Love my Iolite.&nbsp; On my 3rd one.&nbsp; They just improved the ignition system so it is more reliable.<br />The stealth is amazing.&nbsp; I vape all the time in my house and no one in my house knows.&nbsp; There is almost no smell.&nbsp; Heck, I have taken the iolite right into movie theatres (just don&#039;t sit right in the middle, even the vapor can create a sort of haze visible in the projectors light.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m also a fan of vaping because the weed last so much longer.&nbsp; I usually vape about the equivalent of half a regular size joint for about 45 minutes at a time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, because the wispr just came out recently the price for the iolite has dropped.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				ive got an arizer extreme at first i kind of bought it for novelty and thought it would be cool to half a bag of smoke and toke at your own pace walk around etc...now everytime i have friends over everyone wants to use the vape bags instead of the bong. I quit smoking cigarettes a few months ago and decided to use mostly my vape cause its healthier. I also find that it uses less weed then smoking out of a bong or rolling a joint.

				BONG!<br /><br />Been chronic for over 15 years now, it&#039;s a bong for me all the way! We&#039;ve got some awesome bongmakers in AUS, Agung are fucking near unbreakable! I can smoke it straight with no coughs, but I find if I mix a little tobacco it blows my brains out and smears me across the couch!<br />Each to his own eh?<br />I DO think there should be an International piece of legislation made, stating every person on earth over the age of 21, Is required, on pain of tickle torture, to consume atleast 2 grams of cannabis a day. Nothing would ever get done... but I&#039;m a stoner, do you think that bothers me?

				i enjoy doing both. i have a log vape called the underdog. it is a huge hitter. really big warm tasty vapor clouds. the thing rules. i also have a magic flight launch box which is great too. i had a big learning curve with it. but once you get the hang of it you can get some nice tasty clouds. plus the weed lasts a longer time w/ the MFLB. <br />But also just got a really nice Rusty Glass inline bubbler w/ a glass j-hook. i love it. and i have an 16in HVY straight glass tube that hits huge. <br />i&#039;ve owned and sold the arizer solo and the iolite. i like them both too. the solo gives huge clouds too. i just had too many vaporizers so i sold some. the best vaporizer is the underdog. check out a log vape.

				I have a Magic Flight Launch Box and a Volcano Digit. I LOVE vaping and prefer it to smoking. Nothing gets me going like a big, milky ass volcano bag. It is especially good for concentrates/hash. HOWEVER, I do feel the occasional toke is in order.
