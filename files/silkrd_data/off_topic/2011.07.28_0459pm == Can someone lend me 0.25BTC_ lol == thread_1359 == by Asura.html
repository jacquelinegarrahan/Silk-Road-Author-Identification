				The topic was to loan .25 of a btc. I can see that situation. Its not like you can turn cash into btc in a few hours. Well, I guess some places you can, but its a pain. Especially for such a small amount. Now, if it was more than a 1/4 of a btc there would have been different responses.<br /><br />I hope someone would help me if I were in that situation. It would suck to be so close, yet so far. As a vendor, its a pain to put up a special product for a special amount (mostly its hard to get it just right because of SR cut, etc)<br /><br />I just don&#039;t want &quot;real&quot; scammers come on the board and take advantage of our generosity. Helping someone out that is in need (and having the resources to help) is called being kind and generous.

				I think the OP made it very clear (and in a sincere way) that he had spent a lot of time and effort to get his BTC and for reasons that weren&#039;t his fault (the mail strike) the BTC had devalued enough that he was BTC 0.25 short.<br /><br />I think it&#039;s great that *more than one* poster was willing to help him and I surely would if I had been at this thread at that moment.<br /><br />Hell, that&#039;s the kind of cheap karma that&#039;s hard to come by in today&#039;s world.&nbsp; Loan a guy $3.50 to buy some pot today...have that cab driver barely miss taking your foot off as you cross the street in Manhattan tomorrow.&nbsp; Coin-incidence?&nbsp; I think not! :D<br /><br />@marketmaker-hey, I know you bud.&nbsp; You&#039;re a cool guy.&nbsp; What&#039;s got your knickers all in a twist the last few days.&nbsp; Somebody or something in real life has soured your mood and it&#039;s really obvious in your postings.&nbsp; I mentioned it in a pm, now I&#039;ve just put it out there for all to see.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bring back the old MM, I liked that guy! ;)

				@chronic, that is extremely noble of you, It would stand to reason if someone just needed a few pills to get by because they were stollen from them, discharged by their doc for no good reason - you&#039;d be the guy to come to.<br /><br />@Joe - I am like this because every day I hear this fucking shit.&nbsp; The guy is getting a check tomorrow, his mother died, he got robbed, his check was short, he had to spend money on food, etc etc etc.<br /><br />Ok, even if the guy is telling the truth, then what?&nbsp; Why does that matter at all.&nbsp; You want to come here to help people,then don&#039;t make a profit.&nbsp; Everyone has poor luck at times, I&#039;m sure you could tell stories that dwarfed this guys and you&#039;d be more of a candidate for freebies than him,but guess what - you aren&#039;t like that. You are a man who stands on his own two feet.&nbsp; You seem like the type that would go without before begging.&nbsp; Because you realize the value of your face. Your face can get you things when you have no money, it can make people want to work with you that otherwise wouldn&#039;t.<br /><br />But what really pissed me off?&nbsp; The&nbsp; begging sounded just like a real life junky.&nbsp; Nothing is his fault, he is just a victim of circumstances.&nbsp; He has the best intentions, yada yada yada.<br /><br />Then you look down and see a fucking donation sig?&nbsp; Yeah, this is a one-off for him , for sure.<br /><br />
