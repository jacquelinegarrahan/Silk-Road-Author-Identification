				I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m allowed to ask about this... but does anyone know of any or use and clearnet sites for research chems? I can&#039;t seem to find any legit ones and NO ONE will talk about this stuff on any drug forums. I figured the anonymity of the road might inspire some bravery and someone could share their experiences and or sources for legal RC&#039;s.

				Well if you do talk about it then do it in PM.&nbsp; I gave the link to a website selling controlled substances on here and within two weeks their hosting and domain were pulled for violations.&nbsp; This isn&#039;t exactly a low key forum.&nbsp; I would say SR and the SR forums have more LE on them than any other website.

				The reason why they wont discuss it on clearnet drug forums isn&#039;t because they are scared of LE tracking them, its because they are scared that any mention of a source will result in that source being shut down.(which is exactly what happens)<br />SR forums are probably closer watched than the H***&#039;s was, so any concerns that were valid there, are far more valid here.<br /><br />A tip though, safeorscam is &#039;kinda&#039;&#039; useful for research.&nbsp; Don&#039;t take any of the advice there without a large grain of salt, but its possible to find legit RC vendors on clearnet still.
