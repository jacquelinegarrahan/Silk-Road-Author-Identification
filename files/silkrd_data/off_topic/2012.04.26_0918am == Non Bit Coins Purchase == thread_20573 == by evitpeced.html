				Bitcoins are here for your security.<br /><br />With SR&#039;s tumbler, and assuming you move them from the exchange you purchase them from to an e-wallet, and then to SR, they are virtually anonymous, and you get the protection of escrow - so if your product doesn&#039;t show up in the mail, you don&#039;t lose all that money.<br /><br />Buying outside of escrow and with a method of payment other than bitcoins is not something I&#039;d recommend.

				I suggest you read the Buyers Guide (link at the bottom of every SR page), do a google search for &quot;bitcoins&quot; and check out the bitcoins wiki, and browse any and all threads you can find on this forum discussing bitcoins.&nbsp; Everything has been discussed at length, so I&#039;m not going to repeat all of it, but if you have any specific questions based on what you&#039;ve read, feel free to ask.

				My good sir, you have a LOT of reading to do before you make a purchase. I KNOW this shit is exciting, but do NOT just jump in. Read, read, google, erowid, read. Read up on how to buy bitcoins. Read up on how to use PGP. Read up on your first vendor, and every vendor you use. Read up on new drugs. Read up on everything. Be knowledgeable. I&#039;ll try to find some good links for you.

				The first time&nbsp; I came here I didn&#039;t understand any of it, but after coming back and reading some things it wasnt that difficult. You can buy bitcoins from a lot of places, from mtgox if you have a dwolla account set up is your best bet for the cheapest prices, but it takes up to a month to have everything set up w/ mtgox (I think your dwolla account has to be bank verified and have a transfer atleast a month old, so you&#039;re SOL if you have to make a new account), but if you need bitcoins soon or same day, your best bet would be using a moneypak or bank deposit, go on SR and click &quot;Services&quot; or &quot;Digital currencies&quot; and you will find a person who most likely has instructions on how to do everything on their page. <br />I have personally used and will vouch for DrugTrade (Less known vendor, but very legit and best MP prices), as well as BTCpal (One of the most famous and best feedback MP vendor, and also has 2nd or 3rd lowest rates for MP&#039;s)<br /><br />Bank deposits will get you a slightly better deal on btc if you can, but it&#039;s more confusing than MP. I think BTC Buddy has the best bank deposit rates but not positive.<br /><br />Goodluck!

				Buying BTC- Multiple methods discussed - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=20346.0<br /><br />The Rumor Mill, great to look up vendors. ALWAYS research your vendors - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?board=7.0<br /><br />PGP Pictorial. (Encryption, it keeps you safe from unwanted company) - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=131.0<br /><br />Erowid search, a database of drugs (dose amount, effects, law, etc.) - http://www.erowid.org/search.php Just search your drug of choice.<br /><br />And some basic shit: The Silk Road uses a system of escrow to protect its members. This means that when you purchase an item, your funds are in a sort of holding chamber. The person you bought from wont get their money until you click &#039;Finalize&#039;. ONLY finalize when you receive your order, unless you NEED to finalize early. (ie you live in a country that takes 3 weeks to get orders) If someone asks you to &#039;FE&#039; say no, and find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require it. Because if you finalize then they get their money. If you finalize early, they get their money, and you may or may not get your product. <br /><br />That being said, these forums have a plethora of information. Take your time. Really. This is serious shit my friend. People get scammed for hundreds when they&#039;re not careful. Now, there are mostly incredible vendors here, but as with everything, you&#039;ll always have the bad apples. Read up on something. If you&#039;re not sure about something, ask. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. :) If I don&#039;t know the answer, I&#039;ll do what I can to find it. And welcome to the SR. The only place heroin dealers get in depth reviews. ;)

				Thank you so much for all the replies, wow, didnbt realise it was so helpful and nice here, but genuine thanks. I have downloaded my bitcoin wallet, and signed up with the mtgox site, will do a bank transfer to them and go from there, start small i think. Again thanks and I will remember everything.

				Make sure to only use trusted vendors.... 6+ months and over 300 transactions. <br /><br />And be respectful to your vendors, it goes a long way.

				i would recommend using bitinstant.com to fund your mtgox acct<br /><br />you use cash to deposit at a bank, and the funds are available on mtgox within an hour or two. then just buy coins there, send through to an instawallet.org ewallet or two and then onto the Road. <br /><br />super easy, only costs about 5 percent, and you have the coins on the Road within that same day<br /><br />just be positive DO NOT access mt&nbsp; gox from tor or it will lock you out <br /><br />whoever was talking about waiting a month to be able to use mt gox is crazy

				Having to send them a copy of your ID in exchange for having access to your funds.<br /><br />There are other options, like Intersango and Cryptoexchange which benefit from not being as popular as Gox, so they don&#039;t require verification.
