				Other than the obvious options of driving, etc... Is there one everyday activity that you just can&#039;t do while tripping? For me it&#039;s telling time. If someone asks me what time it is, I just get totally lost in the concept of time and can never read my watch. Trying to figure out how long I&#039;ve been tripping for is even worse, I just can&#039;t process that information ever.<br /><br />What about you guys?

				LMFAO that reminds me when i was tripping many years back i kept bugging a fellow trippers brother (who was sober) what the time was till he lost it and said &quot;fuken hell mate i already told you its 3.15pm!!&quot; and the puzzled look on his face as i sat back saying &quot;3:15pm&quot; repeatedly, trying to work out what that meant the time was

				I personally don&#039;t like to be around people at this point.<br />I used psychedelics from a lot of time only in a certain kind of way and this has sort of programmed me against social use (or use for recreation) of them, so much that in one case when I had the opportunity I simply couldn&#039;t stand it and had to go away.<br />No much loss, since I&#039;m not interested in that aspect of tripping anyway, but it can be somewhat counterproductive if the need arise to be in the middle of people.

				My experiments with exercising on LSD have failed miserably.&nbsp; I tried it with a friend once, he had to leave me laying in a sprinkler for twenty minutes because I started to feel very, very weird.&nbsp; I remember looking at him across a field and he was moving side to side in my field of vision a good 40-50 degrees.<br /><br />Driving is another one that, while I&#039;ll admit is pretty stupid, is honestly among the best psychedelics experiences I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; Staying on the side streets on low doses or past the peak actually is quite safe in my opinion.&nbsp; I once drove on the highway with 3 other people in the car peaking on high doses of 2C-P though.&nbsp; The feeling was absolutely insane, especially as I was on the entrance ramp I remember thinking &quot;holy shit, no going back now!&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m older and slightly wiser now though...

				No doubt the #1 thing I can&#039;t do when i&#039;m tripping is dance normally.&nbsp; I fail hard every time lol.&nbsp; The only time that I got relatively close was during a chemical brothers concert where I couldn&#039;t move but could jump up and down (which did not allow much room for error).

				I can&#039;t shower. At first, it sounds great, but it always ends up being terrifying, like I&#039;m in a ghost ship. Everything begins to slowly rock back and forth and I begin feeling sea sick. Then it takes about thirty minutes to even get the courage to get out because suddenly it&#039;s all I know. And once I do get out, I can&#039;t comprehend how to towel myself off so I get frustrated and decide to put my clothes on despite my wet body. Then I realize how much of a mistake everything is, panic, and run to a place where I can be naked and the least confused.

				Things I can&#039;t do when on psychedelics. I can&#039;t orgasm. I can feel reaaaally reaaaallly good, but no happy ending. I also &quot;should &quot; not floss my teeth. Once I have started, I can&#039;t stop, and the next day my teeth and gums are a total wreck. I also can&#039;t eat. For starters, the food looks at me funny. Then, when I put it in my mouth, it just seems all too peculiar that I have this strange alien substance in my mouth, and I have to spit it out, still while not looking at what I had attempted to consume. Finally, I can&#039;t read. The letters turn into dancing potato scribbles mocking me with their gyrations on the page.<br /><br />Not good at kissing either, when tripping my balls off. That up close and personal, all I can see are the other person&#039;s pores, the lines they may or may not have on their face, and I start laughing and wanting to touch them and poke the places that look really funny to me. Makes kissing impossible.<br />
