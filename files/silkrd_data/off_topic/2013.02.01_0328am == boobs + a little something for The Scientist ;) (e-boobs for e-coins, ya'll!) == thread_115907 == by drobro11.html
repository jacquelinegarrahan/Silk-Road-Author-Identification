				You have a nice full arse on you too. And a cute, eager lookin&#039; cha-cha. If we were you, we&#039;d go to one of the better pro-am sites and set up your own nookie-niche. <br />Raw sex and art, as I&#039;m sure you know, have worked to many a gals advantage, just ask Tracey Emin. <br />The world it seems, never tires, and cannot get enough of, fresh pussy.<br />That&#039;s our tip, if you have the, um, balls to follow through it will pay you back in bucket loads.<br /><br />

				LOL Thanks all!<br /><br />I actually just got out of the phone sex industry. It&#039;s super hard (no pun intended) on my emotional and mental state. And that&#039;s fragile to start. We all do drugs for a reason, right!? LMAO<br /><br />Regarding my reddit post: yup! I was on reddit not too long ago to try to make rent and posted my pix (before they got taken down, I was in a hurry and forgot to prove I was me LOL). Now I just want money for bud. LOL - And don&#039;t worry- the post was made on a throwaway! Har!<br /><br />You guys rock for being so sweet to a BBW with low self esteem :)<br /><br />

But yeah, sometimes low self-esteem is unexpected, and you unexpectedly get hard, if that makes sense, ::)<br /><br />murungu, that was her boobs, not her ass lol! Angle was from above, if that clears it up.
