But after he sent 2 small packages he quit on me saying money not worth of trouble<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I noticed you had stated this in another thread, and it seemed to me that you would like to buy but can&#039;t. It that&#039;s the case, then if you could give a little more information maybe myself of one of the other smart folks here can help. Sounds like somethings just not quite right with your process. Two small packages sounded kind of strange to me. If I&#039;m out of line here, just say so and I&#039;ll go bother other people.<br /><br />Is there possibly something wrong with your address that you are using for shipment? Are you following the guidelines for shipments?<br />Could there have been someone in your house that might have intercepted your shipment? Mother/brother/kid/wife who might have gotten the package and chucked it accidentally?<br />Is it possible that you happened into one of our resident dickhead scammers and got scammed? Was it from a reputable vendor? Not asking you to name them, they themselves are not at issue if an established vendor, just trying to understand that there was actually a package (or two) in the first place.<br /><br />If I may ask, what were you purchasing? Knowing what you&#039;re buying might give others a thread that might help.<br />
