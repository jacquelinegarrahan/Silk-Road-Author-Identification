				Can someone on this forum tell me how much trouble I might be in....I woke up yesterday in pain from a burning infection.&nbsp; Half asleep I went online to one of the online doc sites to get a script for antibiotics.&nbsp; they said I had just had a script for the same thing within 30 days so I needed to be seen.&nbsp; So I logged off and logged back in and registered a new account.&nbsp; all same information, just change my name and birthday slightly.&nbsp; They ordered the $4 prescription had it sent to my nearest box store pharm and I went over there.&nbsp; The guy ( about 20) got the script for me then hands me a form to fill out for their records,.&nbsp; Thats where I fell apart.&nbsp; I hesitated and said I wouldn&#039;t be back, then fumbled out some bullshit I cant even believe I said like I was from out of town like, he is going to believe that.my zip was the same as the stores&nbsp; So I filled out the form with all my info and signed it and paid with my ccard.&nbsp; &nbsp;So on the way home I panicked&nbsp; I was worried that he would call to verify with the online.&nbsp; So I called him when I got home and said was I supposed to put my info on the form or my daughters.&nbsp; He said here.&nbsp; I said she doesn&#039;t live with me thought then said she has your address then I fumbled out more bullshit.&nbsp; &nbsp;he verified it and then I said well i don&#039;t see her much(what?)&nbsp; then i blurted out that I usually get my scripts from the local drug. UGH!!&nbsp; I waited all day for the cops to come and get me. My son has me petrified i am going to get charged with something.&nbsp; How bad is this???&nbsp; Would I be charged with falsification medical forms to get a prescription for 6 antibiotics.&nbsp; &nbsp;NO LECTURES PLEASE I cant even believe the whole thing happened.

				Is it a narcotic or just an antibiotic?<br /><br />I&#039;m sure if it&#039;s antibiotics you&#039;re ok..<br /><br />If you falsified a narcotic prescription that is a fourth degree felony, the lowest felony in the code. The maximum jail time is 18 months, up to $10000 fine (I&#039;m not sure of the amount) loss of driver&#039;s license for 6 months plus DEDR penalties and other assessments over $1000. But a first offense is eligible for diversion programs where you would end up without a conviction record. A first offense of this type would not mean state prison or county time. Also in&nbsp; depending on the facts this type of case may be downgraded to where other lesser charges could be negotiated. You could also be charged with theft/fraud offenses. It all depends.

				Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; It was for a 3 day course of antibiotic, and the script was faxed in by an online doctor.&nbsp; I misspelled my name and birthdate to get the prescription from the doc since they wanted me to come in to emergency to be seen.&nbsp; since this was a recurring thing.&nbsp; But I dont have the money for emergency and in pain and wanted meds asap...no narcotics were involved.

				You won&#039;t get in trouble.<br /><br />The pharmacy will probably put your name in their blackbook (aka blacklist), which means they either won&#039;t serve you period, or they will call the doctor to confirm any future script you bring them.&nbsp; In other words, don&#039;t go back to that pharmacy.&nbsp; I am only basing this info on my own experience working in a pharmacy as a tech when I was younger.<br /><br />You didn&#039;t buy narcotics, and the value of a 3 day supply of antibiotics, unless its methicillin is less then the cost and hassle it would take the pharmacy to get the police involved.<br /><br />Do you not have walk in clinics there?&nbsp; I am Canadian, so i&#039;m foreign to how American healthcare works, but if i&#039;m sick I go to a walk in clinic, hand them my health card, wait 10 minutes and see a doctor who prescribes me whatever is required.&nbsp; Is there no such thing like that in the USA?<br /><br />In the future though, never do any of the things that you did.&nbsp; That is to say, order online all you want, just don&#039;t make the silly mistakes and say the silly things you did :) (it&#039;s often better to just not say anything then to try and make excuses in the first place).

				I typically only keep one ear to the news/media cuz well, the world is depressing as shit, most news is garbage politically motivated nonsense that doesn&#039;t just tell us the story, and by the time it gets to your eyes the &#039;news&#039; has been highly screened/filtered/edited.<br /><br />Example I was talking to my dad the other day who watches CNN constantly, and I told him how sad it was that over 4000 ppl have died in Syria so far, and he had no idea what I was talking about !!&nbsp; My dad is an intelligent man, retired 35 years of teaching, its simply that the CNN we get here must not think the uprising in Syria is as important as the one in Libya.<br /><br />The only nonsense I hear about the US is &#039;obamacare&#039;, &#039;occupy wallstreet&#039;, &#039;tea whatever&#039;, all either movements with a very transient and unimportant existence, or hatefully named sarcastic terms for very serious issues (&#039;obamacare&#039; .. which I still don&#039;t know what that means).&nbsp; All I know about what&#039;s going on in the US right now is ... a medley of not very good things and I would never intentionally make fun of any of those things (as much as sometimes i&#039;d like to, given the hate American&#039;s throw at Canada/Canadians for some reason).<br /><br />I meant no offense or malice, I just figured on a regional basis there must different municipal and state legislation on healthcare.&nbsp; They have to have some sort of facility in regions where the poverty is so low they have no choice but to offer them healcare for free/very cheap?

				For some reason I cannot understand either why the revolt in Syria is not getting the same amount of coverage Libya got.&nbsp; It could be since Gaddhafi was doing a little state sponsored terrorism directed at the west we had a soft spot in our hearts for him.<br />It is unfortunate that the only news coming from here seems to be of a partisan type. With fingers being pointed every which way and nobody offering any real solutions, like returning some manufacturing to the US.&nbsp; That&#039;s a beginning.<br />As far as the hate Canada speech, I don&#039;t know what to say.&nbsp; Could be jealousy on some peoples part on your quality of life up there? Low murder rates and healthcare and all.&nbsp; It could also be just a continuation of the tongue-in-cheek &quot;blame canada&quot; song from south park. I don&#039;t feel, at least from anyone I know, that there is any genuine dislike for Canada. Just good-natured ribbing.<br />
