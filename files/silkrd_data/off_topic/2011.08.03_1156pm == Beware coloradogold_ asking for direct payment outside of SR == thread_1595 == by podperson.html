				sellers who bypass the SR system should not be allowed to sell here. he is asking people to contact him before ordering and then he PMs you and tells you to send bitcoins directly to him, bypassing the escrow system. that is bullshit!<br /><br />boot him if he does not change his ways.

				I agree, if they are going to use SR market then Sr needs to get his share. On the other hand. I have 2 options. one buying the traditional way with escrow and one that has to be released before shipping. Im giving the buyer a choice. I don&#039;t demand that they do one or the other. If people trust him enough to give him coins up front, then more power to him, but bypassing sr is not cool. It does suck when you know that&nbsp; they have the product yet haven&#039;t confirmed delivery (I have a few like that right now) (thank goodness for hedging) But, I won&#039;t send big orders&nbsp; out and have to wait for them to sign off. Thats why i give them a choice.<br /><br />

				All of his feedback is obviously fake. Except for the first 2 where he got a 4 and a 2. But it&#039;s just obvious because they all kinda sound like the same person wrote &#039;em.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!

				I already started a thread about this guy elsewhere. I think that we need a separate forum topic that is &quot;Scammer&quot; list or some such thing. It can get confusing to have multiple things around....

				The main problem is that I bet 10 percent or less of all buyers actually come over here. there are less than 2k registered users here and almost 40k on the market
