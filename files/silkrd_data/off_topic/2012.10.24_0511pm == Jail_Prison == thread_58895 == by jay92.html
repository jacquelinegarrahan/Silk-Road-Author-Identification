				How many of you wonderful, law-abiding, model citizens have been to jail or prison? What was it like, was it as bad as everyone told you it would be? What were you accused of that got you in there? I&#039;ll break the ice.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to jail, once. Never been to prison. It really fucking sucked. Not because I felt it was overly dangerous, everyone was actually pretty nice and kept to themselves. The worst part in my opinion is that it was FUCKING INCREDIBLY BORING, plus the food, and conditions were terrible. Other than that though it was fine.&nbsp;

				They do have something similar here in America, you can go to work for the week, and then Friday afternoon you report back to jail for the weekend. I have seen a documentary or a Russian prison, and yeah, it literally looked like hell on Earth. I forgot to mention in my OP that although jail sucked and I wouldn&#039;t by any stretch of the imagination go back, I am happy that I had the experience, if that makes sense. Plus, I was not convicted of anything, so lesson learned. I might have a different outlook on the experience if it would have meant I&#039;d have a record. Jail never really worried me, it was always the record that would follow you around for the rest of your days....

It&#039;s kind of a flip of a coin, yes, the punishments were a lot crueler back in the day. However, nowadays there is just so much petty shit that can get you in deep shit. I.e drugs, prostitution, gambling. If you look at a lot of places too, murderers, rapists, thieves,&nbsp; etc all get out before drug users. The system back then was no doubt bad, but today&#039;s system can easily rival it. In terms of unfair punishments, in my opinion.

				In that I agree with you. There are a lot of people in jail that shouldn&#039;t be there. I&#039;ve seen some material about prisons and they&#039;d give some statistics like: 10% of the inmates of this prison are violent offenders. And all I was thinking: what is the other 90% doing inside?<br /><br />The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and an overwhelming percentage of the people inside are from lower socioeconomic background. That combined with the knowledge that there are a select few people out there making big money from the prison system, leads me to believe that there is something fundamentally rotten there.

				Some of my best laughs have been while I was locked up. The positive things are you get to see a lot of your friends, you get to be silly and yell at the cops all day long making fun of them, you don&#039;t have to be paranoid about being locked up since you already are, you get to work out a lot, it is fun making your own detergent concoctions and making things like toilet paper holders that hang from the sealing and see how much ingenuity you have to make your time go by faster. Not to mention the slams at dinner time!!!

				I spent 30 days in a military prison, or brig.&nbsp; When I woke up for my first morning inside, I had no idea where I was or how I had gotten there.&nbsp; The previous night I had taken 4mg of Xanax and began drinking.&nbsp; Needless to say, I turned into a fucking animal apparently.&nbsp; I was charged with &quot;Destruction of Government Property&quot; and Assault.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t even put to words how big of assholes the guards were.&nbsp; They were all low ranks, privates, etc. so they all had a hard-on for fucking with NCO&#039;s.&nbsp; When it was all said and done, I lost my rank and paid over $3000 in fines.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t mix benzo&#039;s with alcohol...

				No, but that would of been even funnier.<br /><br />You just don&#039;t understand jail humor. The whole block watched and laughed. I can even remember the kids name. It was James and he had a picture of Spongebob smoking a joint with red eyes on his shoulder. He would do anything you asked. We would just mess around with him making him warm up our soups and stuff and one day we wanted to see how far we could push it and got some nice foot rubs. Nothing wrong with a little foot massage. Not gay at all unless he stuck a finger or two up our ass.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went to county jail one time for a DUI for 7 days. It was the worst 7 days in my life! i was let out of the cell for a shower a total of 2 times and i was all alone in the cell. It was so fucking boring! They didnt even give me anything to read, or do so i just sat in the white cell and my mind drove me crazy. One of the worst parts was not being able to see the clock. A minute literally felt like an hour. i felt like i had been locked up for months when i got out.
