				Thinking leads to problems and drama, stop thinking altogether and you&#039;ll find happiness. Literally train yourself to be completely void of all thought, not a single one, for as long as possible and before long you&#039;ll notice it becomes easier and you can begin to live in the moment rather than stuck in the past and future.

				Ughh I wish I could I have breathing issues (they say its anxiety) but most of the time I can&#039;t get enough air to yawn and stop like half way thru and its so annoying &amp; my stomach like twitches and it feel like I have a parisite and the other night I had a dream that there was like a worm (looked like spaghetti) that came out of the side of my thumb and could like go in and out yuckkk. I wasn&#039;t on anything either except my SSRI which I don&#039;t normally take but I was detoxing so figured it would help. I&#039;ve been having these fucked up dreams for a while now and its driving me crazy &amp; as for not thinking I wish I could, trust me I spend a lot of time thinking about how I don&#039;t want to be thinking &lt;3 I can&#039;t stop it either, sometimes I&#039;ll find myself thinking of sinarios that could happen and they actually make me sad. Idk I wish something besides opiates would help &quot;/ tooo expensive.

But I would modify it to stay that while it is important to teach yourself how not to think, it&#039;s not exactly something you want as a persistent state of being. Shouldn&#039;t the ideal be to learn how to think well?&nbsp; :)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=93406.msg661490#msg661490">Quote from: littlemisslovey on December 15, 2012, 06:33 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Soo.. when your brain just wont stop, what is that you are thinking about &amp; what do you do to stop it??<br /><br /><br />sometimes I&#039;ll find myself thinking of sinarios that could happen and they actually make me sad.

A couple minutes of this when I feel especially stressed help get me in a different state of mind. Best of all it&#039;s free and something you can do from the comfort of your own bed/couch/etc. From having read some of your other posts, I&#039;d say we might be cut from similar cloth, so maybe try it out and let me know how it turns out.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Next time you find yourself alone and your thoughts start racing and causing distress, try the following:<br /><br />Sit Indian-style on your bed, with your arms in your lap. Close your eyes.<br />Take your right hand and grasp your left arm midway between the shoulder and elbow.<br />Now, with your left hand, grasp the same spot on your right arm.<br />Relax your neck and allow your head to rest on one of your shoulders.<br />Relax your shoulders, and now gently squeeze your arms.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />And as you sit there, giving yourself a hug for the first time in possibly a very long time, think of all the people you&#039;ve been nice to recently. Think about why you were nice to them. Because you wanted them to feel good about themselves and be happy. Now think about how they would want you to feel. Imagine that the sensation you&#039;re feeling is the arms of each of these people around your arms, hugging you gently.<br /><br />Allow yourself to sit there and experience this sensation for at least a minute or two at first, but if you&#039;re somewhat experienced with meditation you should try for whatever period of time you find comfortable. <br /><br />The idea is not to attempt to repress these thoughts, or self-medicate yourself out of being aware of them, or try to think yourself out of thinking them, but instead to give yourself something *else* to fixate upon. The problem isn&#039;t thinking, basically it&#039;s fixating upon thinking. So performing this meditation *should* induce a feeling that is vivid enough that you can &#039;flip&#039; your awareness to it, and spend whatever time you would have lost to negative thinking instead relaxing into the knowledge that you&#039;re probably a pretty nice, normal person that maybe just beats up on herself a little too much sometimes.<br /><br />Speaking from personal experience, anybody who had a rough childhood will always carry around some degree of existential anxiety until they learn how to parent themselves. Being a child is scary enough just with how vulnerable you are, but if you don&#039;t have loving parents that are always there to make yourself feel safe, some degree of &#039;ambient&#039; fear will stick with you. But &#039;re-parenting&#039; yourself (I&#039;ve found that doing meditations like this on a (semi)regular basis is a good way to start the process, or keep it going) is the way you find your own sense of safety, of self love, and true perspective on your life.<br /><br />tl;dr well, you should read the first part at least! but just know you are not alone, and even the worst of it is just another thing you will overcome on your way to living a beautiful life.&nbsp; :)

				I love this website (clearnet): http://tinybuddha.com<br />It is full of tips and I feel often very supported and peacefully after I read up on the blog. <br /><br />And the tips I want to give about the busy mind, is to observe without judging.<br />Non judging: be an impartial witness to your experience. Observing without judging helps you see what is on your mind without editing or intellectualizing it, or getting lost in your thoughts.<br />Non Striving: no goal other than to be yourself. It is not about achieving bliss, relaxation or anything else.<br />Acceptance: a willingness to see things the way they are. By fully accepting what each moment offers, you are able to experience life much more completely.<br />Trust: in yourself and your feelings. A feeling of confidence that things can unfold within a dependable framework that embodies order and integrity.<br /><br />I hope this helps.&nbsp; :)
