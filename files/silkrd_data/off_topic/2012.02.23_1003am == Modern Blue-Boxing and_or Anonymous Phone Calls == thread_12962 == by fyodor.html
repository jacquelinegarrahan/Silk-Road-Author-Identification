				I&#039;ve spent the last 5 hours looking this up. Blue-boxing if you don&#039;t know, used phone phreaking where hackers war-dialed and found out cell numbers used by tower inspectors, i.e. completely unregulated. This particular method doesn&#039;t work anymore but there must be a way! I bet this guy knows (http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/intercepting-cell-phone-calls/). I&#039;ve seen GSM modems for arduino, but you could still be triangulated no matter your spoof skills, right? If anyone has found a way between all the scams out there please let us know. I&#039;d probably pay for the answer too. Also if anyone knows about voip call spoofing(using asterisk?), that&#039;d be amazing info/setup to get my hands on. <br /><br />So far I&#039;ve settled on using wifi, TOR/VPN, skype, and goog voice as an alternative. I know that voip/skype does work through TOR, but a recent research paper, which I cannot find atm, said any call through TOR longer than about 90 sec could be traced if they controlled both entry/exit nodes, albeit you would be gone by then. I could use an android but I wouldn&#039;t trust it unless I could completely disable the phone when booting linux from the sd card, but current methods are a side-by-side boot, somehow. I could use an old blackberry, but apparently that&#039;s impossible. What about a skype wifi phone? Well they&#039;re really expensive and may not work with the TOR/VPN. So what about an arduino? Well that has no OS so all the apps would have to be from scratch. One guy is doing it though (http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2009/03/using-buttonshield-to-make-open-source.html)<br /><br />What about one of those fancy Raspberry Pi&#039;s?! Good excuse to buy one! Fuck Yeah! Throw an alfa 2W wifi adapter on it with a 7db antenna; run Damn Small Linux, TOR script, and skype; salvage screen, keyboard, battery from an old blackberry. More functionality and cheaper than a skype wifi phone.<br /><br />Let me know if you know an easier/better way or especially if you know how to really blue box with today&#039;s towers. Any research you&#039;ve found I&#039;d be glad to look at.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live!

				Well, I am paranoid, but this wasn&#039;t intended for everyday use, just more of a hacker tool for fun. That&#039;s why I decided to list it in off topic. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live!

				Prepaid cell phones should work fine. They could get your ROUGH location but that&#039;s about it. Take the batter out when you&#039;re not making calls.

				I just find the old school blue box hack awesome and was hoping there was a fix to the new switch board system. A phone with no ID, a reprogrammable number, and no monthly costs would have endless uses... like contacting business clients... I&#039;ve used prepaid cells in the past but this seemed like an alternative worth trying<br /><br />I also find it crazy that there&#039;s all these &quot;free&quot; digital signals floating around right in front of your face, you just have to figure out how to grab them. It drives me crazy.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!&quot;
