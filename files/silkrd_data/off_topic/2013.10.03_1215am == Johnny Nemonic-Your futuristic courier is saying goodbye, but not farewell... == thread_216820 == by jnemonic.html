				Hang in there dingo, you&#039;ve done everything right and don&#039;t deserve this, none of us do. The world is a shitty place, ran by psychopaths, as only&nbsp; psychopaths have what it takes to make it into positions of power. This can be seen as another blow to freedom loving, good, empathetc and intelligent people or it can be seen as another step towards the revolt which is coming.<br />BRING IT!

I could not predict what was going to happen but there was over $2,400 of orders made in the 12 hours prior to SR being shut down.<br />I feel sorry for those buyers and I how they manage to contact me because I will offer them a good deal. <br />A lot of people order MDMA by Wednesday so it arrives by the weekend, so they will now be having a shitty weekend.&nbsp; :(<br />Sorry people, I did my best!<br /><br />Also, fuck auto-finalisers!<br />I would have en extra $3,000 if people didn&#039;t let their fucking orders auto-finalise.<br />All that money locked in escrow for 10+ days which would have arrived in 1-3 days.<br /><br />When I open on BMR / Sheep, I am going to make it extremely clear that orders MUST be finalised promptly!!<br />It really isn&#039;t that much effort to jump online, login and click a button.
