				Than uncut coke on a Monday night when you don&#039;t have to get up in the morning? Got some Zopiclone to come down with in a bit as well.&nbsp; Sorry for the random post.&nbsp; Just feel chatty and no one to chat with.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Hope you&#039;re all having a good evening.

				I enjoy it immensely.&nbsp; Really helps me get to sleep and can be fun for other uses as well.&nbsp; I was starting to get the tweaky comedown tonight (so obviously not super pure blow) and i took one and it&#039;s slowly fading.&nbsp; Heart rate is returning to normal.&nbsp; I had a couple of drinks tonight as well and hopefully I don&#039;t get a bad DI from that but I think it should be&nbsp; fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />A couple weeks ago I was mixing 14mg with over the counter muscle relaxants. Had a blast and a half.<br /><br />Thanks for the +1 it&#039;s only midnight here but yes...lonely and talkative&nbsp; :-[<br /><br />Tried the SR chat but could figure it out.
