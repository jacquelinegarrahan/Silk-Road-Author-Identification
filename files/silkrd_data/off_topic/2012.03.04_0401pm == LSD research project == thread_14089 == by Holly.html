				Hey guys! I&#039;m putting together an LSD research paper on LSD Psychedelic Psychotherapy (20 pages&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;:( ), would you guys like to help me gather sources from all over the net?&nbsp; Given the war on drugs, most research is out of date, but that shouldn&#039;t be a problem.

				I may be wrong but I think that in the Vietnam War, America gave it to rival soldiers to calm them down since trips give you a big ego knock.<br />I&#039;m probably off on some parts but you should look it up.

				I can give you a personal account once I&#039;ve taken my first trip, if that will help...I&#039;ve been labelled with SO many mental health diagnoses that I&#039;ve lost track, including bipolar, borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety, mixed personality disorder, PMT (!!!), ADHD, some weird mania&#039;s....<br /><br />Because of that ^^ I decided to talk to my health professionals and tell them what I was doing. My therapist was DEFINITELY pro-LSD. She used to trip all the time. She even started her response with &quot;I&#039;m obliged by law to tell you the dangers of doing drugs and all that bullshit, so let&#039;s pretend we&#039;ve done that...&quot;<br /><br />My doctor, as I mentioned somewhere else, was less excited about it and told me I might as well stand against a wall and have him throw a knife at me (he has a flare for the dramatic!). <br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t know any official studies, but my therapist had some interesting facts about things that were omitted in the studies from the 70s, I can ask them if you like?

				I&#039;m currently doing an LSD research paper and to be honest your best bet would be to visit a library dude. I found so much useful information on psychedelics there. I found a 960 page book&nbsp; called &quot;LSD: a Total Study&quot; and there&#039;s so much information in that book!

				National Geographic 2009 LSD documentary. It&#039;s a pretty good watch with more than a few talks to David E. Nichols. Might give you some inspiration.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2s9vgAKqFM<br /><br />Full thing on youtube.
