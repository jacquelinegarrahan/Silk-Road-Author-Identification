				Hey folks!<br /><br />Sorry if this is the wrong subforum, I&#039;m a newcomer and have had great experiences with 4-AcO-DMT from here, and thanks to SR become a much more open, happy, content and spiritual person. Not that I believe in God, however. But seeing how everything is interconnected was quite a revelation and took me right out of a long-standing depression. <br /><br />Regardless, to the topic at hand: <br /><br />As I am soon going to a trip to a wonderful place in Europe (traveling from Europe), and I want to bring with me two capsules filled with 5-MeO-MIPT for a great experience with my girlfriend. As I&#039;ve seen 5-MeO-MIPT is a Schedule I drug in England, I was thinking if anybody had any good ideas on how to take it with me. It has to withstand two flight security inspections. In the past I&#039;ve traveled with small amounts of amphetamine and alprazolam (Xanax) and carried that inside my wallet, and they have never asked me to put my wallet on the scanner, but better safe than sorry, I suppose. <br /><br />Any tips/ideas/thoughts on the matter are very much appreciated. <br /><br />Thanks again to all of SR and its members. It&#039;s a great place and I hope it continues onward and upwards. <br /><br />Best wishes, <br />- A<br /><br /><br />

				Sorry man, but I think it&#039;d be crazy to try and take drugs on your person through customs. What you are hoping could turn out to be a good experience with your gf could end up being a hellish one.<br /><br />Try and work on some hook ups in the area - get caught and you probably won&#039;t be able to travel there again.<br /><br />Good luck with everything!

				I have virtually no experience, but this is a thought:&nbsp; Could you find an insoluble thing to store the pills in, and put them in your cheeks/back of your mouth?

				Just check them with your luggage, mix them up with some vitamins, etc in a bottle.&nbsp; &nbsp;
