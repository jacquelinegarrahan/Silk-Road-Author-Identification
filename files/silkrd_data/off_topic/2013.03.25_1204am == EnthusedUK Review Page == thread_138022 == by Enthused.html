Package was very well wrapped (I was using tools to get to the bud!). Stinky weed and I couldn&#039;t smell a thing till I was on the last layer. efficient smell proofing - you can tell some time went into it. That said it wasn&#039;t heat sealed,&nbsp; but I&#039;ve had less smelly bud still leave an aroma after being heat sealed, Enthused&#039;s method was, in my opinion, more effective. during the order I was told they are still working to improve it - sign of a dedicated vendor.<br /><br />Beautiful smoke (Lemon Sour Diesel), buds were whole, had a good amount of crystals, pungent aroma, hard hitting and tastes fantastic. I was very impressed with the strain. Weighed slightly over what I was expecting. Only complaint was that it was ever so slightly wet, this combined with the wrapping method meant the buds were very compact, they did explode in my grinder however.<br /><br />0.2g in a reefer left me stuck to the sofa, I can&#039;t express how much I appreciated the taste of this weed, exactly how I remember it from Amsterdam. An absolute delight to smoke in a bong too, my bong buddy was more than satisfied.<br /><br />Enthused are selling this bud at a reasonable price and I&#039;m sure it will go quickly, no doubt I&#039;ll be back very soon after I realise nothing I can source locally has such a beautiful taste!<br /><br />They are very friendly, prompt to reply and Moo was happy to accommodate my request. Team of 3 working together means replies and deliveries are always going to be quick, these guys have the strains, knowledge, price and courtesy to be up there with the best UK bud suppliers.<br /><br />10/10 Vendor, do not hesitate to trust, keep up the good work guys.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Internal stealth could have been better. Actually, considering the considerable effect and time put into concealing the weed, if the package was damaged and inspected it would have been obvious that contraband was inside. It would have taken a fraction of time and effort to vac seal and place it in an empty dvd box with a fake product list etc. That said, there were no suspicious smells until fully opened and was no worse than many of the other UK vendors. <br /><br />Due to the internal packaging the bud was squished to buggery. The smell was typical 90&#039;s Dutch Skunk, i.e sweet musk. The high was actually very nice and mellow. Not too stoney, just a good balance of body relaxation and mind floatyness. Good for daytime smoking and the high seemed to last a decent length of time. Just to add that I smoked the sample using a pipe as I was out of rizla. It seemed to grind just fine and burned clean. Not the smoothest smoke, but Skunk rarely is. All in all, a good start. If they can up their game packaging wise and not squish the buds so much, they will definitely be a crew to keep an eye on.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I recently ordered a 0.5g sample of EnthusedUK&#039;s bud. I believe it was the Eye strain. I&#039;m not able to access Silk Road at the moment and I can&#039;t remember the actual name of the strain.<br /><br />Shipping<br />I ordered on the Thursday evening and it was dispatched on the Friday via Royal Mail 1st class delivery. Now this would usually be delivered the next day but because of some very bad weather (lots of snow) it did not come until Monday. Still very fast delivery, only 2 working days. When the package arrived it was small enough to fit through the letterbox and didn&#039;t smell at all. From the outside nobody would&#039;ve been able to tell what was in it. When I opened it, the packaging was similar to other vendors I had received items from on Silk Road. It was nicely hidden and took a while to find the product. Like I said, if somebody random was to open the parcel they wouldn&#039;t be able to find the product.<br /><br />Product<br />Although the packaging was smell proof, as soon as I unwrapped the bud the smell was so strong. Probably some of the nicest smelling bud I&#039;ve come across in the UK. I have yet to weigh the bud but I&#039;m not too bothered about the weight as it was a sample I delivered but it looks to be on point. <br />The actual product is very nice. I smoked it and it produced a very nice high and also tasted beautifully. Once again, probably some of the best bud I&#039;ve come across here in the UK. <br /><br />Communications<br />Throughout the process I had sent multiple messages to EnthusedUK and received very prompt replies almost every time. The times I didn&#039;t receive prompt replies was when the message was sent at very inconvenient times, at night for example. The team were very helpful to me and came across as very friendly. I&#039;m grateful to them for allowing me to sample their bud.
