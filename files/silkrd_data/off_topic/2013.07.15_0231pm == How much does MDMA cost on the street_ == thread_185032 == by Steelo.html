				What does MDMA cost on the street in the UK? Of course I know the price will vary in different parts and also depending on the quality, but just as an average what does 1g of MDMA cost? And what would someone be willing to pay for high quality MDMA for a gram? Thanks.

				I&#039;m not from the UK, but any time I have been there visiting, I have paid between £40 - £60/g. I always found it to be cheaper in London. It was more expensive in places like Cardiff and Newcastle. <br /><br />Hope this helps ;)

Or is it really rare for people to pay £60?

				Depends on the circumstances, if it is high quality stuff and say you&#039;re selling it at a club 60 would be easy, you might even be able to get more if people are desperate. It also depends where you are, different places even within London have different values. I wouldn&#039;t mind paying that price though for HQ stuff. Hope that helps, buddy.

Just trying to get a rough idea of how much I could sell my stuff I buy off here for. Also can anyone recommend a european bulk mdma vendor?

				£40 for a gram in the london area, very rarely on weight though and sometimes cut with m1 or other RC&#039;s.<br />Got 2.2g in Bristol for £80 a while ago in fat moonrocks, good stuff .

				If I were you, I would stick with domestic vendors in the UK. TechnoHippy is the man i&#039;d go for if I was living in the UK. ;) No point in being over greedy and trying to get it really cheap when you can take far less of a risk and order domestically, for a slightly higher price. Just my 2 cents ;)

I checked out technohippy and his prices really aren&#039;t that much worse than the European vendors. I might give him a go (:
