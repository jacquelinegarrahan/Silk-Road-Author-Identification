				Hey everybody. <br /><br />I&#039;m curious does SR ever require vendors or buyers to finalize early (I didn&#039;t think so)? I ask because I placed an order, but was prompted to FE. I apologized and told the vendor I do not FE. I told them that I understand business and overhead costs and that I have never made a vendor wait to for finalization (this is backed up by my stats).<br /><br />The vendor replied &quot;We are working to remove this requirement but cannot do so at the moment...&quot; <br /><br />Anyway, I kindly asked the vendor to cancel my order, and he obliged. I left 5 out of 5 feed back, but the listing was gone after the cancellation, which I though was strange, because he still had a listing for a larger amount of the same product. <br /><br />What do you guys think? Did I do the right thing?<br /><br />&nbsp;

				yes you did - stand your ground mate. if you have good buyer stats behind you there is no reason to ask you to FE. i would have asked him to cancel my order as well if that were the case.<br /><br />it&#039;s only noobs that should have to deal with that - because they are new vendors don&#039;t know if they&#039;re trustworthy or not, so they are protecting themselves.

				asdf233, you absolutely 100% did the right thing and I bet looking back, you&#039;ll think that way too. Vendors need to realize that if there running a business, they will need some capital behind them to keep it turning over. That is the same for any business, anywhere in the world.&nbsp;

				Thanks for the support Raoul. <br /><br />I agree completely Wadozo. A business needs liquidity in order to operate in the time between invoice and payment. Normally, this is accomplished by finding investors, or taking out a line of credit. The competition is very stiff on SR, and I suspect this vendor and others asking to FE on small orders will be forced by the market to change their practice.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				even for new buyers FE is BS!!!<br /><br />require new buyers to pay for tracking, but why should new buyers open up to be scammed because the long standing vendor is afraid of the slight chance he will have money tied up for a week. Cry me a fucking river. Vendors need to remember that they were new once, and people probably accused them of being scammers because of this or that, but they proved they weren&#039;t by using escrow as it was intended.<br /><br /><br />This might come as a surprise to all of you FE supporting idiots, but that is what escrow is all ablout<br /><br />that is right, I said it, escrow is here to protect NEW BUYERS from being ripped off by UNPROVEN vendors. <br /><br />and you FE requiring assholes say things like &quot;I have proven myself&quot; to which I say not to the new buyer you haven&#039;t! How can a new buyer trust the feedback left on a anonymous forum?<br /><br />Whining bitch vendors---&quot;oh there are scam buyers&quot; How many hundreds of thousands have these so called scam buyers gotten away with? that&#039;s right, FE netted at least ONE dirtbag HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in the course of a week, and he was a proven vendor. I mean for fuck sake he was the #1 vendor on the site. I fucking vouched him too! So the second he cashed out from 4/20, SR should have implemented the delay in finalization for ALL vendors regardless of how many sales they have done. PERIOD.<br /><br />I always look back to TFM when thinking about the structure and policies of SR, and their vendors were vetted by administration time and again, but you still couldn&#039;t pay for an order until a few days had passed. How many successful orders do you think Joot(RIP) filled and I don&#039;t remember him bitching even once about needing his money up front, new buyer or seasoned buyer. That is how business works. If you aren&#039;t liquid enough to wait until mail arrives for your money, you should probably go back to flipping burgers for a few more years before trying to vend online in public!<br />

				Agreed Wretched. Venders need to handle their sales like a professional business (as many do). If you don&#039;t have the start up capital to compete in the market, then you should probably start locally or find investors.

				it&#039;s good to hear that sentiment from established members. as a new buyer i often feel treated like fry from futurama; &quot;shut up and take my money!&quot;<br /><br />i understand vendors not wanting to have funds tied up but without escrow the SR simply doesn&#039;t function- in light of numerous and recent events, being asked to settle OOE hopefully will be viewed with ever more suspicion. &quot;FE for trusted seller&quot; has been shown to be pretty dangerous practice<br /><br />
