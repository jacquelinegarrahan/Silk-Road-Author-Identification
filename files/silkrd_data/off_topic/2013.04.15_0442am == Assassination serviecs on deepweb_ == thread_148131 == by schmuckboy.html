				I&#039;ve looked through all the deepweb hitman sites and this shit is crazy. Is there any documented evidence of assassinations that have gone down through any of these supposed assassination markets? Does anyone have any clue if these site are actually legit?

				At your wits&#039; end with the wife, huh? ;D<br /><br />Who knows if they&#039;re legit or not. Guess there&#039;s only one way to find out.

				Why risk it? Such a loss of money. Just offer how much you will pay and I&#039;m sure someone will do the deal through escrow on BMR.<br /><br />Chaos

				Most assassinations services are 50 per cent upfront and remainder on provided proof by contractor providing the service, after completed contract, from the hit listings on Tor (Lol, deepweb). But a lot of well-intentioned would-be &#039;assassins&#039; (Lol, assassins or just wannabes?) struggle to build a rep and people find it hard to just fork out 10,000 USD -- has the going rate gone up since last year? -- without this history.<br /><br />The only 2 customers to pay for a hit had their money taken without service provided. It was only 50 per cent but that is a lot when large amounts are given to a complete stranger over Tor. I remember there was someone on the forums in December who offered to do it for 20,000.... ***Raz smiles politely and orders another pizza*** <br /><br />You guessed it. They are no longer here. There is no proof that I am aware of of Tor hitmen completing their assignments but there is evidence of them taking money and simply deleting their accounts on BMR after funds have been transferred and processed. I have not browsed any &#039;assassin&#039; hidden services for since Oct/Nov. They all seemed dodgy. <br /><br />So in answer to the OP q., like IsraService they promise a lot but fail to deliver, might be easier to just do it yourself least you know it&#039;s done. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				As far as I know assassination services on the web all are fraud. Why bother carrying out the assassination when you can just walk away with the money? If you say that you are willing to kill for money, most likely you don&#039;t have any moral scruples about stealing either.&nbsp;

				Ya sounds like they are all scams pretty much. It would be crazy if deepweb hitmen who actually went through with the deed emerged.<br /><br />Just for the record I&#039;m not interested in assassinating people (although there are some dirty scumbags who have robbed me that deserve a bullet to the dome, and I&#039;d pay for it if I was rich), I&#039;m mostly just fascinated by the these sites. The hidden wiki lists them as if they were totally legit.
