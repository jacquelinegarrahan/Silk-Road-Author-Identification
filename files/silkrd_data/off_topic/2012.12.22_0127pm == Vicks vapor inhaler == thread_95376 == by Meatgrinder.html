				Nah it won&#039;t prolong the roll. Lots of people use the stuff though while rolling just because it feels amazing (or something, I&#039;m yet to try it myself).

				Vicks is fun while your rolling and makes you blow up but it doesnt prolong the roll. Its just something that feels good to do while rolling.

				old school vicks inhalers used to have benzedrine and ephedrine in them to help with nasal decongestion...as most of us know those substances also have a stimulant effect...<br /><br />a few years ago they discontinued putting those substances in vicks inhalers...<br /><br />however...the cool minty feeling of vicks on your lungs still feels nice when you&#039;re rolling...some people like having it blown in their eyes too...others don&#039;t...

				yeah a quick inhale here and there just enhances the effect overall I find, but be careful not to overdo it as I find the day after it really messes with your nostrills and my sense of smell seems to be bit off for at least a day or two haha
