				I bought some nirvana kaya gold feminized seeds. I need advice growing them. I plan to germinate them for a week or so then move them into the woods, I&#039;ll grind up some soil where I plant them. My climate isn&#039;t truly awful but it isn&#039;t exactly ideal growing onditions outside either.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never grown weed before.

				I don&#039;t have to water it or anything? Just leave it? Sweet.<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking of using some dirt from next to a river, I figured that dirt works better than forest dirt. What do you think? Should I just buy some potting soil?<br /><br />Out of 5 how many should I expect to germinate and survive, if they&#039;re quality seeds?

				at least 4 of the 5 should germinate. if the quality is good, chances are all 5 will germinate.<br /><br />i&#039;d grow them indoors, cut seedlings, let them root indoors for a while and then place them outside. this way you don&#039;t waste seeds and you can have way more plants than 5.

				how far away from civilization should they be planted? Would Jiffy peat pellets work for germination?

				If they are too small when you plant them out animals will eat them, if you&#039;re planting in the woods then you need a sunny clearing for decent growth.<br />If there&#039;s a river then plant nearby, in case of drought or water shortage.<br />I don&#039;t know how long the growing season is for that strain so I&#039;d plant as soon as possible.

				Ok so then what should I use to germinate the seeds? How long should I let them grow before planting them outside?

				Buy some good quality organic soil. Water it well. Poke a hole in the soil with a toothpick to a depth of half an inch or so. Pop the seed into the hold and gently firm down the soil to bury the seed.<br /><br />Put clingfilm over the pots. Remove as soon as each seed pops its head up.<br /><br />Germinating is best done under fluorescent lights but you can hang up 3-4 household energy saving florescent lights. Best germinate in around 78 degrees heat - buy a small spray bottle and use the thin jet setting to oxygenate the soil around the emerging seeds. <br /><br />Let the pots dry but never go bone dry! Never use feed on seedlings. You can give them a feed to condition the soil they will be placed in. You may need to contend with rabbits and deer in some parts. Humans will steal plants so go off the beaten track. Plant the plants away from sight of each other.<br /><br />It might be an idea to just use clones so take clones off the plants before the flower. That way if anything special grows you have the DNA copy. for next year. It is easy to plant a lot of clones outdoors and its possible to plant up in April / May and come back in the Autumn!<br /><br />Now the summer is here I would suggest hardening off the plants in your garden or a greenhouse. If you only have a few then go to the woods and find a sunny spot. Dig the hole and bring some good soil or worm&nbsp; castings to condition the soil. Plant near a water source if you can otherwise you may be hiking with 5 liters of water. Put plenty of vermiculite or other water holding materials in the hole. You can get water crystals which will retain any water. Cannabis will spread the roots out and take up any available moisture.<br /><br />If you see nettles growing well its likely cannabis will perform well also. <br /><br />Tie down tall plants as nothing gives a plant away like being 8 foot high! It might look ok in the summer but remember in autumn everything brows but cannabis stays green till the end!<br /><br />To tie down - peg up and tie rope to bend over the main stem. <br /><br />Hide any materials or tools you use. <br /><br />Taking a dog with you helps. If not a dog then take a camera, look the part as if your just another woodsman. Don&#039;t dress like Tupac. Don&#039;t wear some ganga leaf tshirt. <br /><br />You may need to buy some &#039;neem oil&#039; to deter any bugs which can do real damage on younger plants. For the first couple of months its best to visit twice weekly. After that once the plant is rooted it will generally do very well if the sun is shining and we get some summer rain.<br /><br />During flowering you need to visit the plants often as its a race against mold if the weather is damp.<br /><br />If we get rain in the last few weeks of flowering, shake the plants of excess rain. If you have a monster some even go to the trouble of putting up plastic sheeting for the home run.<br /><br />Some plant up in big buckets which they can reuse each year. <br /><br />Some even plant in trees but potheads climbing trees is a recipe for broken legs.<br /><br />Harvest is something we can deal with later on. That is fun outdoors. Make a camp for the harvest. Trim it all outdoors and bury the waste. Then its prayer time. The drive home with your buds. Most dry at home. You can always make hash or oil from the moldy bits. If your on the ball you will harvest early if it looks like rain.<br /><br />Frost is a killer also.<br /><br />Best to grow indicas as they will flower in 8 weeks or so. Sativas might never flower in the UK but the USA is fine.<br /><br />Good luck.

				Thanks for the advice. That told me pretty much every thing I needed to know. After I germinate the seed I&#039;ll need to move it somewhere I can water it in it&#039;s pot so it can be safe until I transplant it deep in the wilderness. <br /><br />Should I kill all the plants in the area I&#039;m growing it? I don&#039;t want to have them competing with the cannabis plant for water and sun. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know about tying it down, I&#039;ll just be sure it&#039;s so far away no one could possibly find it by mistake.

				I&#039;ve heard that miracle grow doesn&#039;t work that well. Is there any particular soil brand that works well that I could get at an ordinary store?
