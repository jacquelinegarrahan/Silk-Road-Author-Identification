				switzerland is a beautiful country, very clean but expensive - and fucking winter is long, cold and wet or snow covered. On the up side the prisons are like hotels: you&#039;re allowed to order one meal a week from a restuarant of your choice, and allowed to go to a social event (movie, theatre etc) once a week unless you&#039;re Lector Hannibal<br /><br />haven&#039;t picked the country yet, but it will be in south america, and be so poor it couldn&#039;t afford a name, where the politicians, once bribed have the fucking decency to stay bribed, and has cable, and where UPS &amp; Dominoes delivers. Belize almost fits that descript, Costa Rico comes close as well

Yes Absolutely Japan, I love the culture, the food, the women, the climate as well. Visited there twice for holiday, love snowboarding there as well, the only issue is as stated, society and work looks very stressful. And the drug laws are terribly harsh, it may be just as bad as my own country, but at least its easy to obtain drugs here anyways, whereas Japan must be expensive as fuck, and I&#039;d be shit scared ordering from SR in Japan. <br /><br />Oh my bad I don&#039;t live in the states <br /><br />

				Belize. <br /><br />Not densly populated. Probly the nicest people I&#039;ve ever met in the world. Just love the country.<br /><br />Warm tropical and amazing fishing. You could live on the ocean with no neihbors and be secluded. Low cost of living without the attachment to most technology. Exactly what I want
