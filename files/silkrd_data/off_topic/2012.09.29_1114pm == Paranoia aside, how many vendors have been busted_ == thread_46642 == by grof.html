				I&#039;ve been using SR for about 18 months now, and my experience has been great. <br /><br />I&#039;ve wondered though, is there a rough count of how many vendors have been busted? Searching has mostly turned up rumors and opinions, which seem to be rarely verified by anyone experienced. Considering there are over 500 vendors now, it would be interesting to put a % to it.

One of members on the forum such as Guru, kmfkewm, pine etc, pointed this out to him and I remember them posting his reply which was something along the lines of &quot;Don&#039;t worry about me. I&#039;ve been doing this for a while. I know what I&#039;m doing&quot;. If the member who pointed this out to shadh1 remembers this, could you please post if I have got this wrong so I&#039;m not posting any untruths here. I tried to find the original post but had no luck. It was about him displaying something on his vendor&#039;s page that he should not have done, which I believe was his Private PGP key.&nbsp;

				SR is pretty darn secure for the vendors as long as they put in the time to follow the security protocols.&nbsp; I think most vendors get caught due to their dealings IRL.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if there has ever been a confirmed arrest of a vendor strictly due to SR.

				I don&#039;t see how a vendor could get busted selling on SR.&nbsp; There should be nothing traceable back to the vendor once the item has been shipped.<br /><br />Unless the vendor does something stupid in shipping or packaging process that would leave the traces at USPS.... or accepting payments in other forms beside BTC.

				I also don&#039;t understand how vendors could get busted through SR. <br />how would the piglet LE know the vendor&#039;s location?<br />all this talk about them getting arrested because of shipping international translates to: they shipped to australia which seems to have the biggest hard on for SR. australia is so fucking in tune with SR it&#039;s ridiculous. <br />but this kind of banter has vendors deciding not to ship worldwide, which is truly a FUCKING shame. other countries don&#039;t have to suffer because of australia&#039;s bullshit. <br />vendors can ship worldwide and remain completely anonymous .. just pop those envelopes weighing under 13oz into one of those thousand cute american mailboxes, with proper stampage.. <br />wear gloves the whole time, keep a low profile IRL. deal only with SR. follow the security protocols like a previous poster mentioned.<br />don&#039;t write off international shipping because of these few unfortunate tragedies. <br />my sympathy goes to those busted vendors sitting in their cells. they&#039;re probably despising, HATING australia to DEATH right now.<br />they probably want to stab a kangaroo.<br /><br />other countries like mine for example have not even the slightest clue or understanding about SR or the concept of ordering drugs on the internet. fortunately.&nbsp; 100% success rate so far here. <br /><br />so vendors: PLEASE don&#039;t deny us cute international customers. maybe depending on the country, make your decision. but besides australia other countries should be OK to service.<br /><br />mailing worldwide is just like mailing within USA, if it&#039;s a smaller under 13oz envelope. <br />no trips to the post office, no extra work. just extra stamps. charge more for shipping. i don&#039;t mind paying extra.<br /><br />i am not a vendor but i&#039;ve done my homework so without giving out packaging or strategy details i&#039;m just repeating the obvious &quot;rules&quot;:<br />wear gloves while packaging and handling the contents + envelope.<br />never lick those envelopes to glue them fuckers shut. your dna is your worst enemy<br />print labels with addresses and name all in CAPS and keep the label looking neat and aligned<br />add a cute lil LOGO stamped on your envelope, a brand (example: JOESHMOE UNIQUE GIFTS, Inc). this 100% adds an aura and appearance of legitimacy to the envelope<br />vacuum wrap of course, odorless, etc<br />if you must login to USPS, do it only under T0R. get a prepaid credit card that will be funded and not have any of your real details on it. register that USPS account as a business and use that card to print postage<br />small love letter or business document letters type envelopes that BLEND in with the HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS are obviously preferred<br />apparently USPS is preferred. their workers require law enforcement officials with a warrant to open sealed mail<br />drop off in mailboxes during normal hours, maybe in a different neighborhood or STATE (if possible) from yours<br />don&#039;t reuse envelopes<br />be extra creative and clever with your stealth packaging. always try to improve your stealth<br />never use too many stamps, calculate the correct amount<br />don&#039;t start bragging to friends about your new source of income - this should be first in this list in bold and in caps<br />just don&#039;t mention SR even to your most trusted friend, even your grandmother<br />remain low profile and don&#039;t fucking OPEN YOUR MOUTH. be humble.<br />no need to wear latex gloves, just wear winter gloves when dropping off at a mailbox<br />keep your browser history and PGP software clean and always TRASH all customer&#039;s addresses, info<br />stay on TOR when researching shit regarding your operation<br />FLAT, FLAT, FLAT. keep your envelopes flatter than a skating rink<br />trust noone<br />dark baggies are better than the standard transparent clear baggies<br />usps priority or even better first class mail is much preferred over express for the obvious fact that there are millions less to process / screen with express<br />don&#039;t overdo the DUCTAPING, and using too much tape to wrap the package / envelope. <br />keep it simple, imagine you&#039;re sending a BASEBALL CARD. <br />TRUST NOONE, DON&#039;T OPEN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH TO ANYONE<br />commit to selling ONLY on SR. make a decision between 2 options: either dealing on SR, or dealing IRL. choose and COMMIT to that decision. <br />it&#039;s hard denying IRL customers and their money but IMO the commitment to completely DENY IRL dealing is ESSENTIAL to staying safe.&nbsp; <br />if you must go to the post office, keep your demeanor / energy calm and normal, wear a hat to hide your features from cctv, and go to an office far from your residence. find a post office that has dim-witted or &quot;oafish&quot; employees. <br />avoid those cuntish vigilant NOSY type postal workers that take their job too seriously and may seem sharp and overly aware.<br /><br />sounds fucked up, but there are many mentally challenged or handicapped people given jobs at post offices so find a location with unsuspecting oblivious workers. most of them are.<br /><br />i think the scenarios that went down with those unfortunate arrests was some dealer was involved in IRL shadiness and dealings and got busted that way. then possibly LE found out about his SR activity through his snitch friends or searching his possessions / computers.. maybe found passwords and all kinds of incriminating evidence that ASSRAPED these poor vendors.<br /><br />here is an idea: if it&#039;s rx pills you&#039;re shipping, print out an official looking dr&#039;s note with some fake logo off google images<br />with some medical mumbo jumbo. medicine is shipped every day in this way.<br /><br />there are many truly clever packaging methods but i won&#039;t share specifics due to the obvious reasons.<br />everything i noted here is well known BASICS that have been mentioned several times on here .. nothing revealing of any value to LE.<br /><br />i know vendors must be reading this, so don&#039;t let these examples discourage or spook you. <br /><br />love,<br />mrdobolina<br /><br />

				Add Davidd to the list, he has just been popped and has turn snitch. <br /><br />Anyone who has dealt with him would be wise to clean house now, I&#039;ve received several messages that point to him storing addresses and that he&#039;s flipped on those he has dealt with.

				I seriously have no idea how a SR vendor could get busted unless they are using same return addresses and same post office to mail every damn day.

Once an opening is found in there MO, LE can try to exploit that vulnerability and gather the intelligence needed to pursue the investigation. I finally found the Thread on shadh1 and his poor security practices. It&#039;s written by Guru, who undoubtedly knows his shit and is a well respected member and Spam Buster of this forum, located on Page 2 and it&#039;s Post No.8. - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31481.15<br /><br />As Guru wrote, shadh1 is not the only vendor who is guilty of such things.

Sad.<br /><br />Another great reminder: don&#039;t accept anything other than BTC! How exactly did they track the Western Union I wonder.
