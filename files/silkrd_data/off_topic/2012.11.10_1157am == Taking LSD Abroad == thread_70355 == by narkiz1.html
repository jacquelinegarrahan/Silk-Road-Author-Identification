				So next year I&#039;m going traveling with some friends and had the idea if possible to take some acid, I was thinking about how amazing the landscapes of NZ would appear with the a bit of cid, and just general having fun with friends and all that, couldn&#039;t think of a much better setting to be honest, but the only problem is getting it out there.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been reading up a lot on the stealth of it, and LSD has probably got to be one of the easiest to smuggle, and so I came up with this idea: purchase some liquid lsd, fill up an empty aftershave bottle and put in luggage. Surely there is no way of detecting that? If I am wrong please correct me! <br /><br />I have read over methods such as placing tabs in books, mailing it to myself in advance etc. However I thought that this is probably the most full proof method and it allows me to take much more? Any ideas?<br /><br />

				store tabs under your tongue for the flight they will go unnoticed :) or liquid in a sweet breath bottle wouldn&#039;t look suspicious, and would taste better than hits from the aftershave bottle (aftershave residue doesn&#039;t sound appetizing to me anyway)

				I&#039;ve take it on a plane before... both for storage until later in a trip and storing it under my tongue ;)&nbsp; - Some degradation can be anticipated, but just get a paperback and slip the tabs in the middle where they won&#039;t fall out. And hey, you can read a book too while your on the plane ! NZ was a great time it really is a beauty in the backwoods.

				Man IMO id say its not that serious. yes you dont want to get bagged with it, esp not whilst trying to board a vacation flight. but ive smuggled loads of various substances on planes. in fairly small amounts of coarse, though in your case with L you can take as much as you like lol. if your going to have liqued L like you and the other member said any form of small vial or bottle will sufice. if its tabs there literaly hundreds of places to safely and ver secretly stash your hits. in the binding of a hard cover book, taped inside various electronics laptops etc. or just straight on your person, ive had hand fulls of xanac and oxys just loose in my pockets, only thing when doing that is you want to be 100% sure you WILL NOT SET OFF THE METAL DETECTOR lol. sandals, sweats tshirt , no body jewelery and so on. shit get creative.. one fail safe ive always used is a drwstring sunglass pouch tied and knotted through the button slit of your jeans , it hangs inside by your balls and can be easily tucked into your boxers or breifs w.e it is you may wear lol. i did this for several years hustling blow on the NYC corners, infact ive been arrested and through central booking while having my trusty pouch loaded with football number jail sentances lmfao. FUCK LE! in any event GOOODLUCK HOPE ALL WORKS OUT FOR YOU, im actualy ooober jelous of you NZ vacation trip, no pun intented lol

				Just stick some tabs inside your travel sheets or travel guides, you know, something like that, and put it inside your luggage. Completely undetectable.
