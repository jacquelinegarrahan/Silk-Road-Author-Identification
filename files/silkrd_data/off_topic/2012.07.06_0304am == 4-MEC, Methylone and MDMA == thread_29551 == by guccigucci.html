				I need reviews on 4-MEC.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to be getting some to try, but I want to hear from as many people about it.<br /><br />Have you done it?&nbsp; What&#039;s the high like?&nbsp; Comparable to MDMA or MDA?&nbsp; Body high, or mental high?&nbsp; Psychedelic? <br /><br />I&#039;m curious, because one of my buddies thinks that a 50-50 split of MDMA and 4-MEC would be perfect and bring our cost down SOOOOO much.<br /><br />EDIT: Now want information on M1 (Methylone) too!!

				4-MEC felt more like a plain stimulant. a little on the tweaky side. kind of like a weaker, cathinone based, version of meth.<br /><br />And I know that a lot of people seem to love mephedrone but I personally find that its negative side effects amplify way to easily.<br /><br />I think personally think that methylone (BK-MDMA) is best thing to mix with MDMA to make your headstash last longer (because you shouldn&#039;t cut stuff with RCs if your gonna sell it)<br /><br />and all the other related beta keytones go well with mdma as well (Butylone, Pentylone, Ethylone, etc....)<br />and when I was younger I used to pop a couple of adderalls to boost a roll if I was out of molly (works surprisingly well)

				Cool, thanks for the input everybody!<br /><br />What about mixing with MDMA? Have any of you done that combination? I&#039;m wondering if a 50-50 or 60-40 MDMA to 4-MEC would be noticeably different of a high to somebody who didn&#039;t have extensive experience with MDMA?

				Never tried 4-MEC but my friend has tried it and said he&#039;s not going to bother with it again ..<br /><br />Used to be a frequent user of mephedrone, while I was on it I could party on it for hours on end without feeling exhausted after a while - but the day after I&#039;d feel quite depressed so I stopped using it, but I would still take it if it was given to me of lol&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />For parties I just stick to MDMA now - gotta love those strong come ups ;-)

				4-MEC is nothing like MDMA... Ive done 4-MEC by itself with a few friends.. Lame..<br /><br />I&#039;ve done 4-MEC with 2c-b and it made me throw up 2 or 3 times and it was horrible..<br /><br />VERDICT: Lame and Horrible.

				Ok so it seems like 4-MEC sucks.<br /><br />So Methylone (M1) is a better thing to mix with MDMA is what I&#039;m getting, eh?

				I would use M1 or 4-FA, they both compliment it well if your trying to cut it. The 4-FA adds burn to it though when going up your nose.<br /><br />-drevious

				I strongly advise against using halogenated amphetamines. They&#039;re neurotoxic as fuck!

				@Balzinator<br /><br />I have had the same assumptions about the halogenated amphetamines myself until recently (I too read that post on drugs-forums)<br /><br />And it appears as though 4-FA might be the exception to the rule about the the whole halogenated/substitued amphetamines thing.....Either way, it appears that the verdict is still about as far as the neurotoxic comparisons of 4-FA to 4-CA
