				I am considered a bit of an art fag, if the truth should be told. I am also a bit of a lit snob. My all time favorite poem is by T. S. Elliot, the Hollow Men.<br /><br />Arthur Rackham is the first artist I ever experienced with a dark and twisted bent. His illustrations of my Collected Brother&#039;s Grim completed the stories with unspeakable clarity.<br /><br />I have spent a good bit of time at the Dali Museum in St. Pete Fl, and was privileged to see at the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota an amazing Spanish artist&#039;s works when they were on tour. I can&#039;t find his name in my head right now, damn dain brammage, but his body of work is incredibly bloody, dealing with events from the Spanish/American war...I wanna say his name is two syllables, and has a G in it...<br /><br />I collect art from a variety of genres. I have some Toulouse LaTrac&#039;s that are just mind blowing in the few lines he uses to illustrate the female form, to the brilliant colors of his theatre posters, to how he with just a few brush strokes encompasses the human condition as he saw it.<br /><br />I am also rather fond of Klei, and Escher.
