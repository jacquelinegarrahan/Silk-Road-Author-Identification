				I just want a thread to share our vibes when we&#039;re feeling good.<br /><br />I just vaped some pretty relaxing bud and did a few lines of MXE while currently listening to Time by Pink Floyd with some headphones on and have to say I&#039;ve never been this at peace with everything, including all experiences with LSD, MDMA, and even DMT. None have come this close to this combination of music and drugs. If I&#039;ve ever had the floating on clouds feeling, it&#039;s now.

				Ah&nbsp; Bud, you&#039;re such a cute troll!<br /><br /><br />And Time is a great fucking song, shit, Darkside is a great album!! I saw The Flaming Lips cover Darkside of the Moon at Red Rocks last fall. I ate 225mg of pure MDMA. When they played Time i felt like i was in a dream. Shit was epic.<br /><br /><br />I love music!!!<br />I love drugs!!!

				I remember the first time I ever smoked bud and got incredibly fucked up. Anyone else remember their first time? I&#039;ve never gotten anywhere close to that stoned again, I closed my eyes and watched a movie in my head whilst listening to DSOTM. That was awesome.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t seen it already, I highly recommend buying tickets to see The Wall, it&#039;s a fucking awesome show and might be the last opportunity to see Roger Waters live.

				Bud, you can only wish to achieve the state of bliss I was in last night. Last night wasn&#039;t an escape, as you assume, but rather a celebration for getting hired at my dream job. :)<br /><br />Also that sounds incredible Mr. Amber Lamps, seriously! My two uncle&#039;s live in Oklahoma where the band started and are both responsible for me being a huge fan of their work. They&#039;ve met them personally so many times, I can&#039;t help but be jealous because their concerts are insane!!<br /><br />My first time was pretty swell too blackend, I remember I was listening to Such Great Heights by The Postal Service and it blew my mind away! Music is such a beautiful thing, it&#039;s a real pity how people can even consider censoring such a great art.

				Right? I damn near throw a shitfit whenever I&#039;m listening to a song and get those blank spaces where the words are supposed to be. What kind of miserable fucks decided that was necessary?

They&#039;re awesome dudes. They also put on some of the craziest shows I&#039;ve seen. Seeing The Flaming Lips live is a fucking experience, quite a psychedelic one at that. <br /><br />

I definitely agree on the beer, I find alcohol to be horribly boring and it makes me sick. Never tried MXE myself, I came here for MDMA but I stayed for the psychedelics. I&#039;m sure shit will turn around for you soon enough, I&#039;ve been finding myself in slumps a lot this year but I find that 90% of my problems aren&#039;t problems anymore a week later, so it&#039;s not really worth stressing them in the first place.
