				So over in the UK weve been hitting it hard with MDMA for the last few decades, ive never been in contact with my cousins on the other side of the water so im not really clued up on the scene there. However one thing i notices is the name difference...we call it &quot;Mandy&quot;...works great in code when talking of &quot;seeing your friend Amanda&quot; or&nbsp; asking &quot;Is Amanda around at the moment?&quot;, i notice Americans call it &quot;Molly&quot;, could anyone enlighten me on why? and also how is the rave culture and the general party scene. We have great Teknivals across Europe...google Frenchtek or Czektek to see them. Do you have similar? <br /><br />Also i stumbled upon this article, maybe insulting im not sure, i guess its meant to be tongue in cheek:<br />CLEARNET WARNING!!!: <br /><br />&nbsp;http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/rave-culture-a-handy-guide-for-middle-america?utm_source=vicefb

				America&#039;s biggest rave is EDC, Electric Daisy Carnival. I&#039;ve never been but I know it&#039;s magical. The only thing is it&#039;s getting more commercial and above ground. People not even into the rave culture go because they just think of it as a big party or whatever even though tickets are over $300

				Basically, MDMA has seen a revitalization in the last couple years due to public misunderstanding. Many see &quot;molly&quot; as some new drug when in fact it is just slang for a substance that has been popular for years. <br /><br />It has entered pop culture more overtly due to a number of references in rap music. A particularly catchy line in the rap song &quot;Gold on My Chains&quot; by Trinidad James stated &quot;pop a molly, I&#039;m sweatin, woo.&quot; Recently, molly had been referenced by a number of other rappers and is now desired by the idiot masses who often don&#039;t know the effects but want to try it because they heard about it in the song.<br /><br />This has resulted in a lot of people buying &quot;molly&quot; that is really methylone, 2c-b, mdpv, or some other substance. The actual amount of MDMA floating around the U.S. is quite low. Furthermore, the media doesn&#039;t seem to understand that molly is supposed to reference pure mdma and often claims that molly is a mix of dangerous non-understood substances. There has also been repopularization of the old myth that mdma will put holes in your brain.<br /><br />Ultimately, mdma is becoming increasingly more popular as the edm scene continues to grow and pop culture continues to make references to it. We haven&#039;t been as on board as the UK, but we may get there one day fairly soon.

				Ok Mandy refers to MDMA...crystals. Beans, Ecstasy, Gurners...refer to pills.<br /><br />As for the party scene, that sounds strange to pay to go a rave! In Europe it is all about the free party and Teknival scene. 100 thousand people taking over an abandoned airstrip, huge funktion1 and void sound systems all for free by party lovers and ravers uniting!!!

				i heard &quot;Molly&quot; was short for &quot;molecular&quot; and referred to MDMA when it comes as a powder or in capsules.&nbsp; Eh who knows.&nbsp; Currently the term &quot;ecstasy&quot; has no value at all as a brand name, it can refer to MDMA, meth, methylone, whatever.&nbsp; Some people loudly insist that &quot;molly&quot; refers to MDMA only.&nbsp; How hard is it to learn that term.&nbsp; &quot;I would like some MDMA, please.&quot;<br /><br />BTW there&#039;s a great talk on rave culture at matrixmastersdotorg.&nbsp; Oh my God.&nbsp; The first part of the lecture is political and kind of irritating.&nbsp; But when he gets to the part about &quot;dancing the sun up&quot;&nbsp; I was weeping, it&#039;s so beautiful.&nbsp; <br /><br />My main &quot;rave&quot; experience is burning man, which is going on right now, and I&#039;m not there.&nbsp; And I miss it.&nbsp; Funny how I&#039;ve only really felt at home in a city that is evanescent, that disappears after we go.&nbsp; That&#039;s what they say when you get there.&nbsp; &quot;Welcome home.&quot;&nbsp; You get a hug.&nbsp; I cry like a baby.&nbsp;

				Molly is short for Molecule, known as MDMA.&nbsp; There was a video on abc a while back, an interview with peter jennings.&nbsp; Explains the real effects of MDMA and the history.&nbsp; I&#039;m too lazy to post the link but if you google it i&#039;m sure you can find it. <br /><br />As far as raves go in the US, EDC and Ultra are the two biggest ones right now.&nbsp; The same production company that throws Tomorrowland is trying to make &quot;TomorrowWorld&quot; the no1 rave in America.

				The &quot;rave&quot; scene is America is no longer counterculture, and has been commercialized and in a lot of cases and instances gentrified. It&#039;s now something that starts at 7 pm, ends at 2 am sharp, is FILLED with underage kids, guidos and bros and gang kids selling their fake pills are fucking EVERYWHERE, undercover police troll around asking you to buy shit for/from them or sell to them, no one can stay long enough to be sober so people are driving home 10 or more miles fucked up on LSD, MDMA, RC&#039;s up the ass, and most sadly alcohol. You can&#039;t stay long enough to be able to go home sober, like an actual fucking rave. Now raves are giant parties filled with really awful machinestep/lazerstep that parents drop their kids off at.

				In my area in the UK it mostly gets called Mandy, Mum n Dad or Dizz. <br />The word molly is pretty shit because I know it refers to &#039;molecule&#039;, which can literally refer to any chemical or substance on this planet.. Don&#039;t even get me started on all these celebrities endorsing &#039;popping a molly&#039;, give me strength.<br />The rave scene in america (from what I&#039;ve scene of it in anyway, probably not 100% of it I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not all like this..) looks shit. Looks like a bunch of fags dressing up like spray painted polar bears and wearing enough wrist bands for a whole city to be wearing shuffling around to shitty commercial progressive house, popping their so called &#039;molly&#039; and calling themselves &#039;ravers&#039; and &#039;plur???&#039;. Wtf? <br />Sorry for the rant. I&#039;m just so glad the scene we have in the UK/Europe is very much different/better imho. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion but this is just how I see it.

Sad, but just goes to show what dilution of culture does...

				Some of the comments about American rappers talking about &quot;molly&quot; got me thinking... you mean that people who don&#039;t listen to dance music (whether that be house, trance, techno, whatever...) are taking mdma too?<br /><br />Shit, I dunno why but I always kinda assumed that, unlike coke and weed, mdma was only used by us lot who listen to bleep-bleepy-bleep music made on computers. Maybe cause I&#039;ve only listened to trance for the past 20 years I&#039;ve missed what happens at concerts or non-dance music festivals. I&#039;ve never liked rap but I grew up listening to Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, GnR, etc... and I can&#039;t imagine anything worse to listen to when rolling on mdma. How can you reach for the lasers at a heavy metal concert, and do they sell glowsticks when you go to see Eminem?<br /><br />Do people really listen to anything other than music that is &quot;wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats&quot; when using mdma?<br /><br />Radius<br /><br />ps - I stopped using the word &quot;rave&quot; after Castle Morton... it just sounds so 90&#039;s.

I&#039;ve never been but I know it&#039;s magical. The only thing is it&#039;s getting more commercial and above ground. People not even into the rave culture go because they just think of it as a big party or whatever even though tickets are over $300<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m pretty sure Ultra Music Fest down in Miami is America&#039;s biggest rave fest. Yes I know, not everyone would call it a rave but it&#039;s nothing but EDM and everyone&#039;s dancing, partying and having fun. I call that a rave. Anyway I believe it doubled in size just in the past year to over 300,000. That&#039;s about the same if not a little bit bigger than EDC.<br /><br />Also I don&#039;t agree with the insane prices either and I realize that most people consider raves to be smaller, more intimate gatherings. However I think it&#039;s all pretty similar. I&#039;d love to check out the smaller warehouse raves and such.<br /><br />P.S. EDC was held in London for the first time this year.<br /><br />***CLEARNET&gt;&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_Music_Festival<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Daisy_Carnival<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Its international now and you still think it&#039;s not the biggest? Haha. It&#039;s whatever though. I&#039;ve never been to it and never plan to go. I&#039;d say Utra is a close second. Anyway, why do we have to pay a shit ton of money for raves that probabably aren&#039;t even as good as the ones that go down in Europe?&nbsp; &gt;:(<br />I&#039;ve never wanted to travel as much as I have after reading this thread.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ultra is international as well, in many countries. Either way yeah they&#039;re probably pretty close. And I agree, I&#039;d love to travel and check out the international scene.

I only made it to Ultra one year when I was already living somewhat nearby and I probably will never be able to again. They announced right after this past year that the GA tickets alone for 2014 would be $500. Yeah, fuck that. However it was an amazing experience nonetheless.<br /><br />More affordable EDM fests do exist though, when they&#039;re just getting started out. There&#039;s one called Mountain Oasis Electronic Music Summit that&#039;s like $200 for three days. Still it won&#039;t have the more obscure acts and DJs that don&#039;t travel to the US much like others do (Chase &amp; Status, etc.)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to check out real, smaller raves forever. I just have never lived in an area that had them. Maybe someday...
