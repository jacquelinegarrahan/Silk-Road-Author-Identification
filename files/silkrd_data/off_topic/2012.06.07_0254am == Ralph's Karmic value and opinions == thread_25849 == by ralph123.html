				Hi to all you good folks here on SR. I know that there are a few on here that love to hate on ole Ralph so I have posted this to get your comments and also here&#039;s your chance to give me that negative karma that you love to give me for whatever reason.<br /><br />Anyone up for a discussion? Careful folks. I have a photographic memory so I will remember you but to those who don&#039;t give a F@#k, go ahead do your worse. It may be noted that I am here for the long haul and will soon be opening a vendors account that will offer all different kinds of gear. Of course I will be giving out free samples to get it rolling. For those of you that already know that there&#039;s no way I will sell you anything, go ahead and do your worse, you are already on my black list.<br /><br />To those who have been polite,kind,and respectful, I want to thank you. You have not gone un noticed and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />On a further note, I just want to get along with folks. Those that know me in real life will testify that I am a pleasure to be acquainted with. Prosperity and good will follow where ever I go.

				I have to say originally I felt bad for you with some people giving you a lot of crap.&nbsp; After a while though I read some of your posts and it looked like you were just posting just to get your numbers up.&nbsp; On top of that it seems to me that you have multiple screen names.&nbsp; This is just a hunch but my hunches are usually correct.&nbsp; Obviously I can&#039;t give negative karma so none of it is from me, but at the same time I wouldn&#039;t give it to you on the principal that you could just be misunderstood.&nbsp; At times you do seem like a genuinely nice person, but some of your actions make me not want to be on your side.&nbsp; <br /><br />Take my words for what they are.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t agree then it&#039;s no skin off my back but I think there are enough people that have my back on some of them.

				Freedom of speech bro. I might not agree with what you say but I&#039;ll sure stand up and fight for your right to say it. Maybe your right about the photographic memory thing. I do accept all forms of criticism because that&#039;s a sure fire way for me to evolve into a better person. Thanks man and I&#039;ll take it under advisement.
