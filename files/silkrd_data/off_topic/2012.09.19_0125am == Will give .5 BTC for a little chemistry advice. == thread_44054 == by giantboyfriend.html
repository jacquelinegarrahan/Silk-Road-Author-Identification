				So I have always just gassed my Xylene/MDMA solution with dry HCl gas and everything has went very nice.<br /><br />However this time I decided to build a supply of HCl in dry IPA so I didn&#039;t have to deal with all that gassing mess.<br /><br />I pour the IPA/HCl solution into the xylene and distill off some of the IPA and now my stir bar looks like a fucking sea urchin, what is going on? can anyone help?

				well, there&#039;s a reason people gas :P what type of stir bar are you using? this is quite an unpredicted result. chemically, it should not be occurring. most likely your HCl solution is impure in some way, or the equipment you are using to distill the IPA is contaminated. hard to say. i would recommend trying it again with different equipment and new HCl, but i recognize this introduces the risk of wasting more material. is there a way to post pictures on here? it might be helpful to see your stir bar

				you should not &quot;pour the IPA/HCl solution into the xylene&quot; but adding it drop wise and keep checking pH

				was it not just the stir bar being a point of crystallization

				Distill off all the IPA, extract with water, increase pH, extract with DCM or xylene and gas this time ;)<br />Sounds like you had some weak crystallization going on.&nbsp; If your solution was dry you would have said, &quot;my stirbar looks like the abominable snowman&quot; but sea urchine implies that crystallization is not proceeding correctly, most likely due to water.&nbsp; Even over acidified and wet you can still extract with water and convert back to freebase.<br /><br />I offer chemistry consulting services on silkroad under name &quot;ron paul&quot;
