				Hey Folks,<br /><br />What ya think&#039;s an acceptable length of feedback? <br /><br />Personally not so keen when people write anymore than 4-6 lines.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />

				My reviews tend to depend on the product. Weed imo tends to be a longer review as there are many more things to comment about than MDMA because the smell, taste, fluffyness, and bud size actually matter. Where as with MDMA, all that really matters is if it is potent and if it is shipped with good stealth. <br />Those are the 2 main things I order on here, but basically yeah. Review lengths will definitely be product dependent imo.

				just skip what the fuck ids wrong with people on this forum, if you don&#039;t want detailed feedback about quality of the product and like the ones just got it thanks or fe then&nbsp; don&#039;t read it.

				I personally think the more feedback that someone leaves the better - for example it&#039;s useful to know how long it took to arrive to whatever country the product was ordered from.<br /><br />Surely the more feedback the better??? or am I backwards?&nbsp; :o<br /><br /><br />I must admit lines and lines of people ass licking vendors is pretty boring, but if it&#039;s about product, shipping, stealth, comms etc. etc. the more the better.....SURELY.

				Give credit where credits due . If a vendors service has ticked all the boxes then let everyone know your thoughts . Be it detailed or very detailed , vendors and buyers take away many positives . Boosting sales for one and weeding out the fakes for the buyers too .

				The longer the better. I hate when it&#039;s just one line of &#039;awesome gear you are the best man NUMBER 1 SELLER!&#039; <br />That tells me nothing useful or important. Plus longer detailed feedback seems more likely to be genuine.
