				Well, apparently I smell, or my subject lines aren&#039;t that interesting, or no one likes my handle, because I don&#039;t seem to be getting any responses to my very important questions! So, hopefully this subject line tagged a few more. Rick James got ignored..so..<br /><br />I need to weigh out .165 gram BS, and I don&#039;t have a scale. Would this be comparable to a &#039;pinch&#039; in anyone&#039;s best guess? Or what other eye-scale type comparison could you make?

				how much do you have in total?&nbsp; 165mg is pretty much 1/6 of a gram.&nbsp; If you have a gram you could tip it all out and evenly divide it into 6 piles.

				I have (or will have) 0.66 grams of the coca, and need to add 0.165 of baking soda. At this point, I&#039;m just going to divide up the 0.66 into four sections and one of those fourths will be the size I need of baking soda. Sigh. I just don&#039;t want to waste any damn SHITTTT

				Well, you just put 1/4 eyball of baking soda. If you put more nothing bad can happen. Anyway, you should learn about making freebase and ph values. Its not put at once.Slowly until bubbles stop then is finsihed.<br />Quality of crack depend on purity of coca. You should compare soda with coce when you get it.<br />Yes, making it can be harm reduction matter so I suggest to inform yourself with all information. Remember, without tool, no work!

				This was a math question not a how-to-make-crack question. So, it&#039;s fine where it is.

				Hmm, math question; how to eye measure 165mg without scale? ::)<br />Anyway, if you know how much 0,65g looks like when you receive coke, then THAT can be used as comparable value.<br />I can help better if you have 1ml insulin syringe (I have high resolution scale so I will measure it and tell you on which mark to fill.)
