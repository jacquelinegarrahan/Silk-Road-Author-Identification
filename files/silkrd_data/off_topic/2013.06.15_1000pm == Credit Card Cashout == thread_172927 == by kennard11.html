				but isnt it against the rules to open a thread asking info about defrauding others?<br />Isnt the point of locking threads to prevent the SR forums from being used for info such as this( ie if its not locked people can see the thread and post answers to his questions or ppl can message him answers thus the SR forums are being used to defraud other ppl)<br />I&#039;m only asking this becasue Scout and Samebudiiferent always locked and /or deleted threads like this in the past, Why dont you ask them?

That is why I stepped in - to ensure that the Silk Road forums are not being used to defraud anyone. The person has the card, and will likely find some way to use it. We cannot stop people from PMing them, nor would we want to. We are not here to control speech, nor censor people. The moderators jobs are to ensure that the policies set out by DPR set out are abided by; that includes what I&#039;ve mentioned above, but also includes the protection of freedom of speech.<br /><br />scout and samesamebutdifferent may have locked threads in the past, as did I on a very small number of occasions for reasons that I outlined in them; I arrived here with libertarian views and those are what influence my decisions. Forum moderators have different views on how best to approach certain issues on the forums, and it is not my place to question how they see fit to moderate. It is not my place to ask them - rather as the question is coming from you, it is your place to ask them. However, regardless of all that, DPR has given recent instruction that threads not be locked for reasons other than those that I have outlined above.<br /><br />Libertas
