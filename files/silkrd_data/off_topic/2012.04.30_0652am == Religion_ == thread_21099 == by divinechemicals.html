				So I&#039;m always curious what types of religion or spirituality people have, especially people that do drugs regularly, because I find that a lot of them have interesting perspectives on things.<br /><br />Personally, I was an atheist for a long time, but ever since taking shrooms and LSD a few times, the universe started to piece itself together a bit more for me. Now I still don&#039;t believe in any organized religion, but I have this idea that the universe is a conscious entity, and everything we do is just one more thing that the universe is learning about itself. And when we die, our consciousness is merged with the consciousness of the universe and we are finally enlightened. Or possibly reincarnation takes place, I&#039;m not sure which at this point. But I definitely feel like there is some sort of energy out there, and I think that our physical bodies are just harnessing the energy, so when our bodies die, the energy is released and merged with all the other energy. Or else the energy migrates to a new body, and that is reincarnation. I just see so many patterns in nature and the universe, and when I trip I feel so at one with nature that I can feel it breathing its life force into me and I know that nature and the universe is alive.<br /><br />So how do you all feel about religion and spirituality?

				I think relgion is very intersting.<br />I once used religion purley to allow me to get more privelages at school. (made my own..)<br /><br />Then I started to see how powerfull and useful beleif is, and I tried to believe in it, but I couldn&#039;t.<br />I started researching psychedelics and they showed some really logical things that I really liked.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe in anything right now, but I want to.<br />I&#039;m ready to experience whatever religion, they&#039;re all so intruiging, I even ended up doing some crazy play infront of thousands of people at some multi-religious ceremony.<br />Very interesting.<br /><br />Some very religion people have helped me out immensly, given me food and water, a place to stay.<br />I&#039;m not sure if these people would&#039;ve done such things if it weren&#039;t for their strong beleifs.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure, relgion is very interesting.<br />As long as no one else is harmed (anything against anyones will) I don&#039;t mind it.<br />This is a very person specific situation though, everyone has their own take on religion<br /><br />And yeah, I&#039;m currently testing psychedelics to see if I can learn anything about this universe! :)<br />I lack a lot in spirituality, my personality type is INTP, and I&#039;m 100% logical until my very later stages in life when I develop my feeling side more.<br />So I find it hard to trust feelings, I&#039;m hoping psychedelics will help my spiritual journey more.<br />Allow me to understand anything, I&#039;m not expecting anything, but I&#039;m open :)<br /><br />I want a poll to see what religion is most popular around here.

				I don&#039;t really know what I was as a kid, I believed in god because my parents did but I never really knew which one or anything about him, nor did I follow any religious codes. I basically just looked up at the sky and begged whenever I wanted something. If I got what I wanted, I would go back to enjoying my day and forget all about god. If I didn&#039;t get what I wanted, I would get really pissed off and start thinking about how much I hate that prick. <br /><br />Became an atheist at around 12 or so and now I&#039;m in the same boat as you, psychedelics are having a serious effect on the way I view the world, I don&#039;t believe in a single higher power though.

				i have a problem with religion.&nbsp; both western and eastern religions teach you that there is fundamentally something wrong with you, that needs to be fixed.&nbsp; western religions tell you to look to a god in the heavens, and beg forgiveness.&nbsp; eastern religions tell you to look inward, and fix yourself through meditation.&nbsp; well, there&#039;s nothing wrong with you.&nbsp; you have evolved into what you are supposed to be.&nbsp; there is nothing to be sorry for, to need repentance from, or to fix.&nbsp; <br /><br />i do think the universe is alive itself.&nbsp; to think we are the most important beings in it, made in god&#039;s image, or becoming gods ourselves is a bit fucking insane.&nbsp; while on mxe, i came to the realization, that man is destined to blow up the earth.&nbsp; the explosions from all of the nukes will not only blow up our planet, it will open a wormhole to another dimension.&nbsp; it&#039;s all part of the plan. <br /><br />do i really believe that?&nbsp; hell, i dunno.&nbsp; but something was communicating with me, and it made enough sense to ponder it anyway.&nbsp; the same trip, when that thought of suicide crossed my mind, it didn&#039;t take me to a bad place like lsd or mushrooms started doing.&nbsp; i got up to go piss, and as soon as my urine hit the water in the toilet, the water elemental spirit told me not to kill myself, to keep doing this drug, and it would all make sense later.&nbsp; <br /><br />so, i agree with you that there is something we haven&#039;t grasped yet.&nbsp; we are not alone.&nbsp; but our individualism we expierence is just a side effect of the human expierence.&nbsp; we a spiritual beings, expierencing a human expierence, not human beings searching for a spiritual expierence.&nbsp; religion has twisted it all around, to make us believe we are bad by nature.&nbsp; we&#039;re not.&nbsp;

				Man, I tell you I don&#039;t get the classic heaven and hell religions. Cause shit if I went to their version of &#039;heaven&#039; that shit would actually be hell to me. Freaking harp playing and spending eternity just fucking smiling peacefully and shit. The classic halo and wings stuff.<br /><br />It reminds me of this classic episode of an old 70s TV show called night gallery( from the writer and creator of the twilight zone). This guy dies and gets sent to hell. He wakes up and is in a basic everyday boring living room. A phonograph plays an endless stack of records of music he can&#039;t stand ( its the 70s remember, heh). He tries to get out of the room or change in environment in any way, but it magically just stays the same boring way. A demon appears to him and tells him &quot;you can&#039;t do a thing here to change it, you are in hell, get used to it.&quot; The guys protests saying ,&quot;if this is hell, where is all fire and brimstone and torturing and stuff, I thought hell would be like that?&quot; The demon replies, &quot;oh no this is YOUR version of hell, oh and by the way there is a room above you exactly like this one for another guy, and he likes it if that is any comfort to you....&quot;<br /><br />So one man&#039;s heaven is another man&#039;s hell. Personally, I believe we just become worm food when we die. <br /><br />But I have to admit I definitely have felt &quot;tapped&quot; into something cosmic and spiritual when I have tripped on various substances in my past. But I kind of chalk up to intense brain chemistry really in retrospect.<br /><br />One weird thing I vaguely believe is the possibility that IF any kind of aliens exist in a classic &quot;grey like close encounters of the 3rd kind type&quot;, that they are actually us humans from the future. That they are future time travelers that have come back to &quot;guide&quot; us along in a way. Of course I don&#039;t why they mess around with all that anal probe shit LOL, maybe that&#039;s rogue elements of them fucking around.

				Religion is truly less and less relevant in these times. <br /><br />Most, or some I guess... who experience heavy psychedelics often see the connection of all things to all things. <br /><br />Anyone here done dmt? <br /><br />There&#039;s no such thing as life and death. Life is who we are. Life is infinite. Birth and death sure. But life is an ever changing circle of cycles. You have always been, and you always will be. <br /><br />It&#039;s this relative universe, this relative experience that we again re define who it is we choose to be in each new now. <br /><br />Science and spirit are merging into deeper understandings. <br /><br />Either it&#039;s all connected, or it&#039;s all random. I&#039;d have to say the culmination of overall experience has me seeing connections everywhere. I&#039;ve always seen/experienced things I call miracles. Too insane to believe but it happened! But remember perspective creates and changed perception. So we have and will always have challenges in life, and our truth is ever emergent and changing, growing. <br /><br />We&#039;re all star dust :)

				I am a great proponent and believer in Spirituality. Although at this current point in time I&#039;ve hit a bump in the road, it&#039;s something Humanity as a whole needs to take seriously for many reasons. So many have become oblivious to the everyday beauties of life, but when you begin to take notice and question those things, it becomes apparent that the Omniverse is too perfect to have been created without the assistance of some Supreme Being. As Humans, we have long since lost our connection to the divine, and as a consequence of that our world has been living in trepidation. Without the most slight awareness of your Spirit and the Spirit realm, there is such a vast store of knowledge many are missing out. So many secrets that can only be seen through the eyes of Spirituality, and possibly lead you to the Creator. I say this because the incredible sophistication and understanding of many ancient Vedic, Anasazi/Hopi/Native American, Mayan/Inca/Aztec cultures was absolutely astounding. Their understanding of our Universe, their understanding of the cyclic nature of all things, and their understanding of their own creation stories, is so ahead of their time that we, the modern Human, are unable to comprehend and understand their teachings. And yet these civilizations are looked at as &#039;primitive&#039; by the modern world.<br /><br />I see Spirituality as the search for Omniversal knowledge, as well as the connection to the divine, in a nut shell.

My parents have absolutely no effect on my Spirituality. It was a journey I decided I needed to take, and one so fulfilling I would not have imagined it if I hadn&#039;t experienced it. I felt like there was a veil over my rationality, something which was preventing me of seeing the true depth of everything around us. There were so many things I thought I had figured out, only to find out that I was continually stuck at the surface. Hell, I used to look up at the sky and take it for granted. 5 years later I&#039;m entranced by constellations, and the infinite, transcendental beauty of the Omniverse. I suppose it&#039;s all perspective, which is part of the reason why I don&#039;t judge, nor will I ever attempt to change anyone&#039;s beliefs.<br /><br />I belong to no religion, I&#039;m simply attempting to understand the experience of physical life as I go on. The greatest truth to Spiritualism, is to NEVER rationalize. For when you begin to rationalize, THAT is when the brain begins to produce possibilities and opinions on whether or not it is reality. Science and rationality can only explain so much. When one finally realizes that he is not simply flesh and blood, or when one realizes that &#039;Life&#039; does not end after &#039;Death&#039;, then it will become far clearer than it ever has.

				My first teacher said &quot; don&#039;t let your beliefs about what we are doing get in the way of your *practice*.&quot;<br /><br />That is a view I still hold. Dogmatic religions that center around ideology or schema are just not useful. Religions (and associated fields of endeavor) that give you TOOLS you can USE to discover the world you are in and what you are.. those are useful. Things like Buddhism (for the meditation), Daoism (for the incredible utility of it&#039;s world-analytic framework and intuitive spin) or certain variants of low-church Christianity (for social cohesion, familial harmony and building character). But in all cases I&#039;ve seen when your BELIEFS start to run out ahead of your PRACTICE.. you lose, sometimes traction, sometimes the game itself.<br /><br />Another wise guy (under the influence of acid) replied to a querry &quot;Do you believe there is a God?&quot; , his response (serene and smooth) was <br />&nbsp;&quot;I have experienced the phenomena many seem to refer to as &quot;God&quot; but I am unable to speculate meaningfully on the ontological status of that phenomena.&quot;<br /><br />

Either way, nothing really worked and whatever shit went down did. But by about age 10, this all changed after an experience in a particularly secluded part of the States. This experience came to me during a particularly mystical experience throughout this particular trip with my family.<br /><br />I was alone, in the middle of nowhere, staring down never ending, perfectly ordered rows of trees. As I stood there, I felt an overwhelming sense of weightlessness, akin to being on the verge of passing out. This was different though; I was very clearheaded and in fact, in retrospect, it actually was most akin to the sense of mystical escape you get from mescaline. Granted I was 10 and this feeling utterly destroyed my sense of grounding or purely non-individual thought. I guess you can say I experienced god because when I sat down I started getting a flood of thoughts I had never known before. Streams of information were being fed to me it felt like. This event, I now consider to experiences I&#039;ve had while enduring a mushroom ego dissolution. <br /><br />My most profound recognition was what I now know is the utter realization of the inevitable death that I would eventually face. Myself, I am utterly worthless in the grand scheme of life. For the first time, I began to examine myself, rather than react to my surroundings. For no reason tears flooded my eyes and I wasn&#039;t sad. Rather, I was thankful to finally return back after what was a deeply transcendent experience. I will never forget the image of those perfectly aligned, perfectly space, dead, winter trees forming a near mirror-like image at the &quot;end&quot; of the rows. Many others had been there before, and later I would learn of many old secrets of the land that locals had hidden for decades.<br /><br />This was the catalyst to myself as a conscious participant in life. Looking back on it now, I still feel like this &quot;past&quot; memory is really my &quot;present&quot; memory. The fact that it exists as a easily retrievable thought in my brain, out of countless experiences in this body, shows that it has deeply affected me. Thought, in the present tense, is always the progression of a previous flow of information. But don&#039;t we all get into certain &quot;chunks&quot; in our lives? What I learned then, I didn&#039;t have the words to accurately explain to myself, but instead manifested into a deep appreciation for a strong-willed militant atheist by 12; I remember thinking that there was no god when I was laying in bed on the night I turned 13, realizing that the innocence and time I had on this planet was whittling away and eventually I could no longer run away from it. <br /><br />Now that I&#039;m older, this thought has had time to work out and now I understand what the message was. I was dead from the beginning. All those sudden realization of how important my family was as a kid. Really, we are already dead. This, for many people, is the hidden force that doesn&#039;t show up for blind people until their &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot; Well, I have it every night I stare at my ceiling and remember the very first image I can ever remember. That of hovering over my parents bed, in my old, old childhood home slightly above the ceiling fan as it whirred at a surreal slow motion, dreamy wir...............wir................wir............wir.<br /><br />Images, feelings, awareness. I don&#039;t get it. My life has been nothing but a fucking generic story of the generic witless protagonist. I have yet to fully understand the TRUE nature of my own existence quite yet but I have been lead into odd, very unlikely events&nbsp; that I otherwise had no plans or knowledge of at a time I thought I was REALLY aware of myself. Does it ever end? Who knows. Does energy every TRULY stop. Existence is weird, but I never really worried about me forgetting my way. I always felt that I was onto a certain tract of information, and it lead me here. <br /><br />I am high if that matters, but I was curious if others feel similar. If not, oh well. Wish everyone the best in their interpersonal/religious/spiritual/random journeys!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I liked your post:) I too have had my head flooded with image&#039;s i didn&#039;t understand? I was hoping it wasn&#039;t a medical issue? The romantic side of me likes to think its either the past or the future bleeding over? Could just be weird chemical brain activity. But when i take my morning walk,with my dog and give thanks to the East, I hope this life is eternal..........and spell dog backward&quot;s ....Happiness to all. Happy May Day

				I am somewhat traditionally religious.<br /><br />But I hate the idiots who give a bad name to those of us who believe and are not total douche bags.<br /><br />I believe we are called to love people, even the unlovable.&nbsp; The best and only way I know how to do that it to give more than I get, and help those who cross my path and need it.<br /><br />I&#039;m the schmuck that gives bills to the guys on the street corner every time I see them.<br /><br />I remember my parents... every holiday like Christmas or Thanksgiving, we would go buy dozens of cups of hot coffee,&nbsp; breakfast sandwiches, and food from the local fast food place and feed the homeless before we would have our own family get togethers.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, to me, not only does it feel good to give, but people need to know that there are other human beings out there that care.<br /><br />I believe that I am no better than any other human being... I do believe we all are flawed.... but I think when we are loving and caring for one another without expectation... that is our calling.<br /><br />But that is just me.<br /><br />
