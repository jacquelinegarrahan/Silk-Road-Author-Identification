				http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/laser-can-instantly-scan-you-anything-and-you-would-never-know-it<br /><br />That inconspicuous brown box above is reportedly a new kind of laser-based molecular scanner that can collect spectroscopic information from more than 150 feet away. It can instantly probe your clothing and luggage for chemical traces of anything--explosives, drugs, biological matter--and you will never even know it.<br /><br />So says Gizmodo in a mildly terrifying piece posted this morning about Genia Photonics’ laser scanning device, contracted by an entity called In-Q-Tel, which is basically a group of private technology incubators working for the CIA. The idea, reportedly, is to install this molecular scanner in airports and border crossings and the like, where it can deliver instantaneous (it analyzes in just 50 picoseconds) spectroscopic analysis of people and cargo from a distance--and likely from an unseen location. Authorities could scan everyone passing through an airport terminal, sports stadium, or customs check.<br /><br />Or it could scan everyone simply walking down a street. It’s supposedly portable, so it could be deployed anywhere from far enough away that the subject wouldn’t have to know about it. Reports Gizmodo&#039;s anonymous author:<br /><br />“The small, inconspicuous machine is attached to a computer running a program that will show the information in real time, from trace amounts of cocaine on your dollar bills to gunpowder residue on your shoes. Forget trying to sneak a bottle of water past security—they will be able to tell what you had for breakfast in an instant while you&#039;re walking down the hallway.”<br /><br />DHS says the technology will be ready for deployment in just one or two years. You can practically hear the privacy rights groups gathering their pitchforks for this one.

				If true that is actually some terrifying shit. I can 100% see the practical uses and there are tons of legit ones but fuck man... its still going to suck. <br /><br />I wonder what type of legal implications this will have. For example, imagine going to a bank that had one of these and you&#039;re getting ready to deposit a large sum of cash and this machine picks up &quot;significant&quot; (whatever that may be) amounts of cocaine on the cash. Would you be questioned? Reported? Detained? <br /><br />The amount of information this gives to authorities is terrifying. <br /><br />&quot;Genia Photonics has 30 patents on this technology, claiming incredible biomedical and industrial applications—from identifying individual cancer cells in a real-time scan of a patient, to detecting trace amounts of harmful chemicals in sensitive manufacturing processes.&quot;<br /><br />Now those are some pretty cool uses of this technology. This is basically an example of &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot;... this technology has the potential to help many people but it also has the potential to harm many people. Yes you probably have to be doing something illegal for it to harm you even though the &quot;crime&quot; you are committing might be harmless.<br /><br />&quot;There has so far been no discussion about the personal rights and privacy issues involved. Which &quot;molecular tags&quot; will they be scanning for? Who determines them? What are the threshold levels of this scanning? If you unknowingly stepped on the butt of someone&#039;s joint and are carrying a sugar-sized grain of cannabis like that unfortunate traveler currently in jail in Dubai, will you be arrested?<br /><br />And, since it&#039;s extremely portable, will this technology extend beyone the airport or border crossings and into police cars, with officers looking for people on the street with increased levels of adrenaline in their system to detain in order to prevent potential violent outbursts? And will your car be scanned at stoplights for any trace amounts of suspicious substances? Would all this information be recorded anywhere?&quot;<br /><br />That just gave me the chills. The future is scary, gentleman.

				If it was mass produced, that could possibly be the end to drug dealing period.&nbsp; Hopefully someone starts working on some sort of encasing that can reflect/redirect the scanner or mimic something else...&nbsp; I guess we should appreciate what we have until then.
