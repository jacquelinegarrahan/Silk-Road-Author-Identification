				I don&#039;t get my weed from SR (yet...).&nbsp; IRL it is slightly more expensive than SR, but I have an excellent and safe connection (my father-in-law!).&nbsp; I currently have:<br /><br />Outdoor sativa (grown by my father-in-law; another reason my wife is the bomb!)<br />Outdoor indica - (I think) - very energetic buzz (also my father-in-law)<br />Hydroponic lemon haze - cost $400 per 28g.&nbsp; It has been over cured and crushes to shake too easily, but damn if it isn&#039;t fine.<br /><br />Edited to say my father-in-law doesn&#039;t charge me, so I guess it is cheaper than SR lol

				Some Romulan, Magic Kush and a pre-rolled jay of shake. The Magic Kush from Kush411 is my favorite out of what I have now, but I need to get something else to try.<br /><br />This is a bit off topic - Has anyone else been smoking since they were a teenager? I have seemingly not been able to achieve the same highs that I could when I was younger, and I have to wonder if that&#039;s due to changes in body chemistry as we age or if it&#039;s something else. <br /><br />It&#039;s possible that it has something to do with the quality of weed I was able to find around town when I was younger and better connected versus now. Even if I smoke a metric ass ton of weed now, I just can&#039;t seem to ever hit that same high I used to. It was sorta psychedelic at times.

				At present I have some very nice Moroccan hash from Globalshipping and Evilution, and some extremely tasty and potent BD hash from GoodTimes.&nbsp; I also have an ample supply of Strawberry Cough from Emerald Triangle and a little bit of Grape Ape from the Goodtimes sample.&nbsp; (Just smoked a bit of that and will be heading off to bed soon).

				I probably have about 40 different strains of bud right now and even more strains of hash/concentrates but my favorite at them moment is a thai strain that took 16 weeks to flowers and has the most amazing trippy high I&#039;ve ever had in mj, really impressed by this.<br /><br />Maybe one day I&#039;ll go through everything and make a list if I get bored enough...
