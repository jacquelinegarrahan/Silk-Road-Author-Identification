				Ive been a long term user of xanax, dont mind a valium sometimes, but i find after xanax<br />benzos i find some of the 3-hydroxy benzos, mainly oxazepam &amp; temazepam dont work anymore.<br />I use dto love rivotril(clonazepam), they have lost their edge also.<br />So, what are your favourite strong benzos among the other compound benzos like:<br />&nbsp;Lorazepam<br />&nbsp;Etizolam<br />&nbsp;Phenazepam<br />&nbsp;Clonazepam<br />&nbsp;Triazolam<br />any others in the older classes like<br />&nbsp;Brotizolam<br />&nbsp;Flunitrazepam<br />and any new ones i havent heard of.<br />Any opinions, experiences, etc. especially in comparison to Alprazolam<br />would be appreciated,<br />thanx everyone.<br />matt<br /><br />&nbsp;EDIT: i meant to post this on &#039;off-topic&#039;, if it is more at home there fell free to move it if necessary--thhanx

				I like good old valium the best.&nbsp; Xanax is very effective too but doesn&#039;t have quite the recreational value as diaz, for me anyway.

				Clonazepam for sure.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want a quick powerful high,, I want a LASTING moderate high and k-pins last like 8 hours before I start to come down off em, absolute god-send for work.

				My favorite benzo has to be 1. xanax 2. ativan for its fast acting properties. taken at high mg of course 2 to 3mg. for steady relief of anxiety i prefer 1mg clonazepam every 12 hours. i&#039;d like to try etizolam. i&#039;ve tried phenazepam that will knock you right on your ass and have you sleeping for two days.

				Klonopins for the long half life it has. When taken in the right amounts it is very strong and feels good man. As previously said, very good for social time like work and college since it lasts very long.<br /><br />Valiums even though i have to take like 50-100mg at once too get a very good euphoric daze..nothing like high dosed valiums....yes my tolerance is very very high. I used to take twenty- 10mg valiums through out the day sometimes and still function fine!

				I have never tried klonopin is it worth it?<br /><br />So far I have tried xanax, valium, etizolam and temazepam.<br /><br />i tried temazepam years ago when i was young and combined it with weed and got really fucked up it was good.<br /><br />I think benzos all have their own unique properties where it depends on the mood / situation which one I use<br /><br />for example, Diazepam, love the muscle relaxant properties and the effects last longer than Xanax which is a plus. <br /><br />I love xanax for the quick onset but the effects dont last that long, it doesnt have the relaxation properties I think diazepam has, but in a very stressful situation Xanax would be top of my list<br /><br />Etizolam is good for anxiety, I find the motor coordination is most effected by this drug, it can make me feel very &#039;drunk&#039; when taking 2/3 and smoking, I like the feeling of etizolam but for some reason its still my least favorite, no idea why<br /><br /><br />I have only used valium for a speed comedown so far, I found it helped I think it would of been alot worse without it, I took around 30/40mg but it did not knock me out, does anyone know if temazepam or another benzo would be capable of this? if so, would it leave one feeling worse in the morning than just popping a few valium to help rest instead of sleep??

				Im a bit scared of taking Klonopin(rivotril over here), i hooked in one night years ago, they were 2mgs,<br />the next day had my 150mg methadone dose, when that came on i was fucked UP!, I couldnt see properly<br />unless I closed one eye. This wasnt good when I was driving around delivering truckloads of sand &amp; soil.<br />Ended up drifting out of my lane, into a turning lane-smashed into the cars waiting to turn. They had to cut<br />me out, leg was crushed a bit. Now the guy only gets 0.5 Rivotril, I take 16-20 of them, to try equal 4 or 5 <br />2mg Rivvies, it doesnt do shit, Im on 4-6mg xanax a aday, so maybe its that. Temazepam, oxazepam dont work anymore either.<br />I just want a bennie that will give me a good stone on weekends, its all i do now. Dont smoke weed anymore, dont trip anymore.<br />So im fishing for tips on a good benzo that will hit me good on a friday night....and Sat, Sun. ::)<br />thanx for the input guys<br />I might try Etiz. &amp; phenaz. still considering.
