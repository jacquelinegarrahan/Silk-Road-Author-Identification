				I&#039;m not sure what this post is going to achieve or how it will turn out but I&#039;m going to put it up. <br /><br />I won&#039;t pretend to be so familiar with Assad&#039;s leadership to unwaveringly support him. Whether or not he tortures and kills or not is beside the point. I think it is naive to believe that there is a leader in the world that doesn&#039;t utilize force and torture to maintain their position. I do know enough about the tools and mechanisms of war and oppression. It is laughable to believe that there is a &#039;global threat&#039; from Islam. I think it is a convenient scapegoat used by men with nefarious goals for ALL people, regardless of nation, color. or political affiliation. The war in Syria is another attempt by globalists to bring another &#039;radical&#039; under the tutelage of the corporatist plutocracy. Everything we see is a lie. Everything we hear is intended to MISinform you rather than educate you because IF you had the information you might choose to think that what is being done is wrong. We can look back now and see how Standard Oil&#039;s exploitation of South America was wrong and destructive to innocent cultures that placed no value on western ideals. Is it not possible to look forward and see that this is another example of a future regret? Or will we become so disassociated with humanity that it no longer affects us on that level. Will we all be drones of the state, incapable of empathy?<br /><br />A link to a youtube video that hints at the truth no one seems to notice.<br />Al-Qaeda urges regime change in Syria <br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvHJywCBNQg<br />Israel supports regime change in Syria<br />http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=261738<br />America wants regime change in Syria<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkjZTOj1DiA<br /><br />I used a variety of sources which don&#039;t necessarily reflect my beliefs. They were used to show a variety of sources on a unified theme. Comments? Opinions?
