				So I started reading about the TOR network off a music website and doing some homework I found an aritcle on SR and here I am. Now I find all this deep web stuff very interesting. How does one go about finding different TOR sites since im assuming they are not readily available on CNN, haha. And no im not looking for pedo shit either, im a girl. just interested in the concept and getting a better understanding

				Deep Web wiki: http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />the search engines are a good place to start for whatever you&#039;re looking for<br /><br />Also, precautionary note to others: This post is very possibly an attempt by LE to get an invite to more private forums, so don&#039;t be a dumbass and send an invite just because she&#039;s a chick. Not that there are no girls on the internet, but just know that it&#039;s a common tactic for LE to pose as girls when trying to socially engineer/get info out of people on the internet -- happens with anonymous all the time.
