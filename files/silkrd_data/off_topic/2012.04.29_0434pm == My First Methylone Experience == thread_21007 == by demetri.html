			<dd class="postbody">
				After reading good things about Methylone (M1) I decided to order some and give it a try. My interest in M1 was partly to see if it could help with social anxiety and purely for recreational fun. I ordered 1g from TheEmporium and it arrived about 2 or 3 days later. It was in a sealed foil pouch and the appearance was a flaky off-white substance with no noticeable smell. I weighed out and it was overweight at 1.13g. I decided to gel cap it for taking orally but wasn&#039;t sure what dose would be best. As it was my first RC and I was a bit nervous taking it, I decided to take a sensitivity test low dose first and then try to gage what would be an optimal dose after.&nbsp; So I put 50g into a gel cap and 60g into another one. I figured if the dose was too low I could re-dose to avoid wasting it.<br /><br />THE EXPERIENCE<br /><br />The next day I decided to try it as it was a Friday and I didn&#039;t have much work on. I had taken 10mg Baclofen in the morning for anxiety and as it turned out, it gave me a terrible migraine as I haven&#039;t taken it for a while. I took the 50mg M1 in the afternoon around 1pm on a fairly empty stomach. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t feel any come up or euphoria, but then after 40 mins or so i did feel a slight caffeine-type boost in that I became more mentally alert and little shivers came over me. I hoped it would build to something but it didn&#039;t. At least I wasn&#039;t feeling any ill effects, although I did feel pretty amped like I&#039;d taken too much coffee, a little jittery. After waiting an hour I decided to take the second gel cap containing 60mg to see if that would help move things along. It was now 14:40. I took it and waited but again no come up or euphoria. However the speedy jittery effects I was experiencing increased significantly to a level that was not very nice. I felt tension in my shoulders and neck. My thoughts were racing and doing anything that required mental concentration was hopeless. I even struggled to count some stock and kept losing count. After a couple of hours I needed to go out but was feeling very jittery so took 0.25mg xanax to calm things down a bit. That helped, and I rode across town on my bike in heavy rain and wind, which seemed to hit me harder than it would normally. I&#039;m sure the M1 made me more sensitive to the cold, even though I felt hot. The wind and rain felt like a knife cutting into my skin and I couldn&#039;t wait to get home. <br /><br />I was a bit disappointed I had felt such negative effects from the low dose. I thought perhaps Methylone wasn&#039;t suitable for me due to my anxiety and perhaps it was amplifying it.<br /><br />THE NEXT DAY...<br /><br />Being the weekend, I decided to give the Methylone another try at a higher dose this time. I had read a few reports saying that the good effects only manifest past a certain dose, which is usually 100mg for most people.<br /><br />Time and setting: <br /><br />15:50, Saturday afternoon, alone at home. I have been working on some difficult programming which has left me mentally drained and very tired so I decide to take a break and think an energy boost from the Methylone might help me resume my work later. I&#039;ve had no other substances today, not even caffeine. I take 120mg of Methylone gel capped which was accurately weighed on a precision scale.<br /><br />T+10mins I start worrying have I done the right thing considering the anxiety and physical stress I experienced from the lower doses yesterday. I decide to take a couple of hits of good quality weed. After that I move to the sofa. I decide not to do anything except watch some TV and try to enjoy the experience, whatever it may bring.<br /><br />T+15mins I start to feel the onset of the weed high and it looks like I smoked more than I thought as I&#039;m pretty getting pretty well stoned. I worry again have I made a mistake mixing this potent weed with the Methylone and maybe it will be a bad combo. I put the worrying out of my mind and just go with the flow remembering I have xanax on side-by if it gets too much. Watching the TV helps keep my mind occupied. I let go and sink back into the sofa, trying not to worry. <br /><br />T+30mins By now the peak of the weed high has passed (no munches strangely) and my stomach begins churning and making noises. I take this as a sign the Methylone is starting to work. Sure enough it is. I feel an alert and the room suddenly becomes much brighter. I grab a mirror and notice my pupils are as big as saucers! I lay back and just wait with some trepidation but also excitement. Within a few minutes the come up begins. It&#039;s like the weed high which is centred around the lungs is giving way to a new kind of high. The only way to describe it is a full body orgasm. It comes in waves that spread out from my head down and then from my solar plexus and out to my outer extremities.<br /><br />T+1.30hrs These waves of pleasure continue coming leaving me in an utterly blissful heavenly state. It feels like the euphoria of a very strong opiate and I can&#039;t help myself smiling and laughing. I feel the urge to touch my skin and hair constantly. Every time I stroke them I feel more waves of pleasure surging through me. It seems as though with my hands above my head there&#039;s an energy field stroking my head, even though my hands are just moving above my head and not in direct contact. There&#039;s an odd sensation I feel as the waves of euphoria wash over me..my skin feels very hot and cold at the same time. I look in the mirror at my face. It is very flushed. I&#039;m now writhing around and sighing from the pleasure &quot;like a bitch on heat&quot; as someone else once said! The women on TV all look incredibly attractive right now and I&#039;d give anything to have one here.<br /><br />T+2hrs I feel I&#039;ve reached a plateaux phase now. My head is buzzing and feels like its been stroked from the inside and down my neck which sends cold and warm shivers down my spine. I feel a little of the jittery amped up feeling I experienced yesterday, but the pleasure I&#039;m feeling balances it and it does not bother me in the least, especially since I&#039;m lying down and sinking into the sofa. I get up briefly to see how it effects my coordination and anxiety level. I&#039;m ok to walk but feel a bit jittery. I lie back down again. I feel I have to keep moving my arms and keep engaged in something because I have soooo much energy. The TV is not enough. I just keep stroking my hair and head, then my arms and chest. Each caress feels amazing and I wish I had someone to massage me. I begin to feel very &quot;loved up&quot; and start to have intense feelings of love and empathy. Around this time I also feel some jaw clenching and tightness but I&#039;m able to make a conscious effort to relax my jaws and not grind my teeth. I close my eyes and see some closed eye visuals. Scenes of beautiful exotic and peaceful places seen from above with different skies, from beautiful sunsets to peaceful moonlit twilight hazy places. It is very much like the 3D landscapes others describe. I feel as though I&#039;m moving over these landscapes from above. The best way to describe these visuals is like a waking dream but when I open my eyes they&#039;re gone and hard to get back to when I close them again. I feel incredibly aroused but not in a sexual way. This is strange, it&#039;s more emotional than physical. A longing and urge to connect with someone. The pleasure feels better than sex but I decide to try and reach orgasm to see how it feels in this state. It requires a great deal of effort. Getting and maintaining an erection proves incredibly difficult. I&#039;m unable to focus mentally and my thoughts are shifting frequently. Eventually I manage it, but it proves to be disappointing and merely a distraction from the main event. The pleasure from the orgasm hardly compares to the Methylone and was not worth the effort. <br /><br />T+3hrs It&#039;s now almost 7pm and I can feel the plateau phase is starting to decline and giving way to more of the jittery energy feeling but I am still feeling a lot of euphoria. I&#039;m longing for the blissful state not to go but I feel it is gradually subsiding. The thought of re-dosing crosses my mind briefly but I instinctively know my own physical limits and feel it would be a bad idea. I decide to smoke another bowl and see if it can prolong the experience or at least make the comedown a softer landing. <br /><br />T+3hrs 20mins Sure enough the weed does indeed bring back the waves of euphoria and there&#039;s another mini-repeat of the come up earlier. It seems the weed and methylone have perfect synergy and enhance each other. It feels pretty damn good but I feel not so overwhelmed and in awe this time so I get up in this pulsating state and make a small snack (some celery with peanut butter). Eating the celery feels divine, better than sex. I lie back down and start to think about stuff. I become very introspective and this is where the experience takes on a briefly negative aspect to it. I begin to delve into my problems and my life. I&#039;m drawn into a real downer and depressed state. I even start to feel depersonalized, as though I&#039;m seeing myself from a third person and feel I must seem weird to other people. A hopeless feeling starts to envelope me. I&#039;m able to snap out of this though and direct my thoughts to positive things and start thinking about how I can change my life for the better. It&#039;s at this time I get some great personal insights which I verbalise into a recorder. They just keep coming and it suddenly makes sense what I need to do. I begin to see things from a much clearer and objective head space. Part of these revelations centred around the ego. The insight I got suggested that the ego is responsible for many personal problems people experience and my own in particular. When a person becomes introspective the ego looks inward and becomes too self-critical. Meditation is the only way to dissolve the ego and reduce its negative effects. I also gained insight into social anxiety. I felt the problem was being socially isolated and not making the effort to go out more. I felt that people are social creatures and that we need that social connection to feel normal and happy. Isolating yourself just makes you feel abnormal and unhappy. It doesn&#039;t matter how minor the socialising is, any amount of contact with people helps keep you connected and balanced. <br /><br />T+6hrs It&#039;s now nearly 10pm and my appetite is returning so I have a late supper. Eating feels good, but I&#039;m unable&nbsp; to finish all the meal as my appetite isn&#039;t very much. I&#039;m still feeling quite stimulated with mild euphoria but I&#039;m becoming tired mentally. I decide to spend the next two hours watching a film and some videos in bed, hoping it will settle me down for sleep.<br /><br />T+8hrs It&#039;s now midnight and I&#039;m unable to sleep and feeling a bit restless with all his physical energy yet mentally tired and ready to sleep. I consider smoking a bowl to help me chill me but decide better off it as I&#039;ve already smoked quite a bit today. I lie down and try to sleep and eventually manage to drift off.<br /><br />T+10hrs I woke up at gone 2am, feeling restless. There is still residual physical energy. As I need to get a decent nights sleep to be functional tomorrow, I decide to pop half a Xanax tablet (0.25mg) to chill me out, rather than smoking another bowl. This does the trick and within 30 mins I&#039;m out like a light.<br /><br />T+16hrs I wake at 8am. Had a really nice well rested sleep with some interesting dreams. The dreams were all social dreams about family and people I&#039;ve known. When I dream of social interactions normally the social awkwardness I have comes across in the dreams. But not this time. The dreams were perfect and left me in a very positive and happy state when I woke. I felt so relaxed and comfortable that it was hard to get up so I spent the next hour just enjoying this chilled out happy state. No doubt the xanax was responsible for some of that. There&#039;s a raging storm outside with howling winds and heavy rain. It feels so good feeling warm and comfortable under the duvet. I begin to reflect on the experience last night. <br /><br />T+17hrs I get up at 9am and make a cup of decaf. It feels cold and icky moving around but I feel fine. No hangover feeling, no aches, nothing. I still have some residual jittery energy at times. My mood is very upbeat and positive, almost like I&#039;ve taken an anti-depressant.&nbsp; <br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />It seems from my experiment yesterday that Methylone only gives you the euphoria and bliss-state if taken at the right dosage. Lower doses do nothing except make you feel jittery and stressed. And re-dosing again does nothing but increase those negative effects. For me, 120mg was definitely the sweet spot. At that dose, the jittery feeling is there still, but much less prominent than at the lower dose because the euphoria overwhelms it. It feels as though you need to flood the brain with a decent dose to get the dopamine and serotonin flowing.<br /><br />As nice an experience as it was, I still don&#039;t think this is a good drug for social anxiety or anxiety sufferers in general. What I mean is, if you&#039;re expecting to drop some Methylone and be the life and soul of the party or super confident, it&#039;s not that type of drug. I certainly didn&#039;t feel capable of going outside or functioning socially on this. The depersonalization and negative introspection was a bit worrying but I&#039;m wondering how much the weed may have influenced that as I had a very potent cerebral strain (C99).&nbsp; <br /><br />How does the Methylone high and euphoria compare to other drugs? Well Methylone is definitely an amphetamine stimulant and the speedy side to it sets it apart from weed and opiates, in so far as speeds up thoughts and amplifies the senses. However the euphoria and high is comparable I guess to somewhere between cocaine and a strong opiate. The speediness of it does not make for the same &quot;I&#039;m so contented, my world is perfect&quot; warm cotton wool feeling you get from an opiate high. On an opiate euphoria I feel the urge to go out and be more social because I feel comfortable in my self. On a Meythlone high I feel it&#039;s more purely recreational and something to be enjoyed privately. It provides a brief escape from reality that takes you to a very nice pleasure place.&nbsp; I do think time and setting is important. It&#039;s better if you&#039;re relaxed and not doing anything but also have your mind engaged, perhaps watching a film or cuddling up with someone. I think what would be amazing is soaking in a hot bath during the come up..maybe in the evening with scented candles and some chocolate and nibbles on standby. Ideally with someone to scrub your back! <br /><br />As the euphoria waves subside beyond the plateux stage, you begin to feel more of an opiate-style feel-good glow. Your thoughts are speeded up a bit and you feel slightly jittery, like you would from caffeine. There&#039;s a lot of energy which lasts for many hours after the euphoria. I think in this state it&#039;s ideal for doing manual labour or housework. Work just seems easier and you can get things done quickly with no physical discomfort. If you&#039;re exercising on this I think you need to be careful. I could easily see myself pushing too hard beyond the pain barrier and overdoing it.<br /><br />Methylone is often described as moreish with people saying they become fiendish for re-dosing like cocaine users due to the fairly short plateux duration. I myself felt no real craving to re-dose. Maybe that&#039;s just due to my own body chemistry, having anxiety and being very sensitive to drugs. Or maybe the re-dosing cravings set in later the more you use it perhaps. For me, the experience wasn&#039;t just about the peak and euphoria phase, the effects of the drug lasted until I slept. I felt under the influence of the drug for a long time. The way I see it, you can&#039;t have the really good part, without the longer tail end part and you have to think about whether you want to sacrifice that much time and how it might effect your ability to work and sleep. <br /><br />I agree with others comments on sensible Methylone use. I definitely don&#039;t think this is a drug you can take frequently, and certainly not more than 2 days in a row without at least a week or more between. It feels to me that so much pleasure and energy has to come at some fairly high cost on&nbsp; brain chemistry and the body somehow. I can&#039;t speak for everyone but I feel that I would certainly do myself harm and experience a burnout if I kept re-dosing and doing this daily. At the very least my routine would go out of the window and I wouldn&#039;t be able to work. It&#039;s more like a &quot;special drug&quot; for special occasions or perhaps something to take once or twice a month over weekends. One important final bit of advice..be sure to have plenty of water nearby. Methylone makes you lose a lot of body water through sweating over several hours. It&#039;s important to replenish it constantly else you can feel very dehydrated and icky. <br /><br />Retrospective<br /><br />The following day: I found the good effects I had experienced on waking continuing. My skin still felt sensitive and a soak in a hot bath felt wonderful. Normally by afternoon I feel drained of energy and extremely lethargic. I don&#039;t know whether this due to depression or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, my health is terrible. Today I felt energised and fully motivated to tackle the dreaded housework I&#039;ve been putting off for weeks. Within 2 hours I had cleaned the whole place from top to bottom and still had plenty of energy. I&#039;ve been suffering with a bad knee which causes pain when bending but today I hardly noticed it. This suggests Methylones effects on the body might offer some possible pain reflief&nbsp; as a residual benefit. The main benefit though was that I felt much more positive, uplifted and at the same time at peace and comfortable in myself. I think possibly this might help with anxiety and interacting with people, assuming it&#039;s not a one-off effect. I&#039;m keen to repeat the experience again, only next time I think I&#039;ll not use weed, just to see how Methylone is by itself. It&#039;s too early for me to say, but I think based on my first experience Methylone could have some theraputic benefit in both a physical and emotional way.

			<dd class="postbody">
				<br />It&#039;s been just over a week since I had my enjoyable second methylone experience and decided to try it again today..<br /><br />This time I dosed 100-110mg and it was almost a repeat of the first disappointing experience (no real euphoria, just a lot of stimulation).. I waited 2 hours and re-dosed 70-80mg but it did nothing to improve things, just created more stimulation which made anxiety worse. <br /><br />I been taking Stablon a novel anti-depressant up until yesterday, and although it has a very short half life (2.5 hrs) I&#039;m guessing it might have affected the Meythlone as I haven&#039;t taken anything else.. either that, or the dose was just too low.

				Wow great review, thanks for that. <br /><br />But whats up with all the anti-anxiety meds man? <br /><br />Also what you reviewed sounds an awful lot like XTC, especially with hardly feeling a thing a week later. This stuff has been on my mind for quite some time now and now I can take it off since it doesn&#039;t sound that interesting at all, to me.

				Nice report, thank you. Just so you know, you&#039;re supposed to redose within 40 minutes, otherwise it just extends the experience a bit, but it doesn&#039;t make it stronger. Also, as you just found out, one week in between the experience is not enough time for your serotonin levels to be back to normal, so you end up feeling stimulated but without the bliss. This could end up in very compulsive behavior (at least from my experience). I know it sucks waiting, but one month is the general rule, and after you do it month after month after month, eventually the magic is still lost and you have to wait longer.<br /><br />I suggest doing it in a social setting, that way hopefully you can meet some ladies and dance, instead of just watching tv and masturbating. The euphoria is amplified by the setting. I&#039;m saying it from experience, not being mean. :)<br /><br />It does sound like good quality Methylone from your report, so maybe I&#039;ll get some from him.
