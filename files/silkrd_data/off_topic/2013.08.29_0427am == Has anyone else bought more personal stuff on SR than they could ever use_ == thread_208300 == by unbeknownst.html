				Just curious, I can&#039;t be the only one. I&#039;m the kind of person who loves drugs but doesn&#039;t often have connections where I live for most substances of any quality, so aside from great weed I used to have looong dry spells. When I found my way here I was overjoyed to the point of tears so I started stocking up! I am not a pessimist who thinks the road will be gone tomorrow, but it is a reality that LE could put the regulatory squeeze on some of the tech that keeps it flowing, like BTC. Since drugs are more affordable in quantity I found myself justifying large orders thinking I could just keep all this shit in the freezer or unload some at festivals to recover part of the cost. On top of that I have had some amazing experiences with vendors who have given me way more than I purchased :0. Astonishingly, it cost only a month&#039;s disposable income to have lots of everything rare and illicit I ever wanted to try. As I have sold drugs before irl and hated the lifestyle, I ultimately decided that I don&#039;t really want to sell this shit to unknown kids; too risky. So I have given quite a bit away to friends and gone on as much of a binge as I can get away with! In past times I would have killed to be in this situation, what can I say, life is hard.

				I have bought lots of shit that I have never used before and have no intention to use, just wanted to &quot;have&quot; some for just in case. I too have amassed quite the illicit drug collection.&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s for rainy days or the end of the world...in either case there is something very comforting about going to bed every night knowing I have a large cashe of psychedelic drugs in a very well hidden spot at my disposal.

				Yes! :-D<br /><br />It is amazing how hard it is to get busted for buying drugs when you already have them all!

I know exactly what you mean. In my case a lifetime of deprivation has made me a dope hoarder, even though I am anti-that when it comes to anything else. My priorities are well sorted I believe.

				Since the MDMA drought in Europe a couple of years ago, I now have a nice small stash of MDMA and ecstasy tablets more because I don&#039;t do as many any more and also in case they dry up again. It&#039;s a fear almost but not as much now as I don&#039;t do as many.<br /><br />Now that I have a coke addiction, I like to be ahead of myself and will order more even though I have a small amount stashed

				Not yet... but that&#039;s the plan!<br />Consistent, low-key, low-volume, purchases of all our personal psychedelic favorites until we have enough for the rest of our lives. We dose MDA, MDMA, or &#039;shrooms approx once a month, and the &#039;shrooms are home-grown. That means my meager monthly purchase = about a year supply for the both of us. Marijuana is abundant and inexpensive where I live, so that&#039;s not an issue.<br /><br />I&#039;ve looked into it a little, and it seems that molecules such as MDA, MDMA, 2C-?, even Mescaline and Psilocybin are all highly stable (not so much for LSD). If kept in dark, cool, air-tight containment, they will most likely last longer than you will. As long as Silk Road lasts long enough for us to amass a 40-50 year personal supply, I&#039;ll be a happy camper!

I did not expect anyone was going to those lengths! This could be the best opportunity some of us who aren&#039;t into buying on the street get to hoard the good stuff. Hope not, but who knows? It would be terrible indeed if a stockpile turns out to be necessary over the next 50 years! I guess I would if I thought I could keep them safe and potent, but my lifestyle is eternally chaotic and I move around too much to risk losing the stuff.
