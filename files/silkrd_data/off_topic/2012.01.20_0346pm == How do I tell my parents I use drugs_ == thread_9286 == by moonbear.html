				Well, it seems to me that those types of people will NEVER respect you. People who are against drugs, are oddly FOR pharmaceuticals. Being a psychopath...err.....psychologist tells me he is probably way down with BigPharma, especially if he has published works. Not to knock your father, but all psychologists....I&#039;ve never found psychologists to be a trustworthy people. What they learn is from books, and not life or experience. He probably prescribes drugs that he&#039;s never taken. It seems as though he would never respect you if you told him. But love, real love, conquers all. If he really loved you, he still would if he knew about your addictions. Respect is totally different. <br />When I was 14 my mom asked if I had a drug problem. I said yes,there&#039;s not enough! We had a serious talk, she cried a lot, but in the end, I retained the love of my mom, and her respect. I told her basically what Mr. Grey said. I said, I am going to do it, and I am still going to love you, and if you decide to not still love me, that is YOUR choice, not mine. <br />My father never cared what I did, so that wasn&#039;t a problem. <br />It also helps if you are a responsible adult who pays their own bills, insurance, etc. Jobless, homeless bums are not respectable addicts.

I will try to explain this to my dad as I have before. When I try to be straightforward he typically says something like, &quot;just remember your dad warned you not to go down that road.&quot; At least he&#039;s not a hypocrite, though. He does not prescribe drugs, and he actually told me when I was little not to take my adhd medication. Perhaps he was right, since I&#039;m now addicted to it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t see where the problem is with people who hate drugs. I&#039;m a deans list student and use drugs. But somehow all my success in life is forgotten when people realize I don&#039;t conform to their social norms and values. I wish I could find a way to understand their closed-minded mentality and try to fix it.

				That&#039;s a tough situation, and in all honesty, it&#039;s incredibly difficult to argue down your parents, even if you are right, and they know you&#039;re right, because chances are, they&#039;re probably not going to give in because that was their line of thinking for so long and they won&#039;t easily admit defeat.<br /><br />Clearly, your parents are associating drug use with something incredibly negative. Why? Because it&#039;s illegal? If that&#039;s the case, then is alcohol or nicotine any better just because it&#039;s legal? Because they fear that it will become your downfall? Clearly, you&#039;ve been successful what with being a dean&#039;s list student. I guess my best advice is to ask your dad why he thinks it&#039;s so bad. I mean, he&#039;s got a degree and he&#039;s a psychologist, so clearly he should have intelligence and reason to discuss this with you in a mature manner. Get to the root of why he looks down upon drug use, and work from there. <br /><br />Good luck!

				There are ALOT of people with extensive educations who use drugs quite regularly. It&#039;s the only way some of us can deal with other people&#039;s bullshit :P&nbsp; &nbsp; Most likely though, your parents won&#039;t want to listen at all. It might be worth a laugh to mention to your dad that Sigmund Freud, someone famous in a field related to your dad&#039;s, used cocaine daily for many years. There&#039;s also a Nature article from 2008 stating an estimated 20% of scientists in academia use brain boosting drugs like provigil and ritalin. These drugs are even more popular now so the % likely has gone up. Maybe your dad has a chip on his shoulder from having to compete with the people in his field doing drugs?&nbsp; Another gotchya for non drug users is the fact that Francis Crick, a Nobel prizer winner in genetics, was tripping balls on LSD when he first deduced the double helix structure of DNA. Or Paul Erdos, a major methhead and one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. Steve Jobs dropped acid too. And don&#039;t forget Carl Sagan and Aldous Huxley.<br /><br />But parents never want to hear about the facts when they have decades of government propaganda to use as a club on their own kids.

				With my parents it seems that it&#039;s impossible just to tell them. Not that they can do something to me but as they just can&#039;t understand that&#039;s not a hurtful thing to cope with. So I came to solution that only possible way is to give my dad LSD with perfect setting and he can see himself. I haven&#039;t done that and I don&#039;t believe much I ever will. Times are changing and it&#039;s not for all the people to drop their illusions where they&#039;ve lived for decades.

				Maybe your dad doesn&#039;t have a problem with drugs but he has a problem with his 14 year old kid taking them when he should be doing 14 year old stuff like swapping pokomon cards and doing homework and maybe thinking about what he is going to do for the rest of his life with a fucking clear head??

				I was pretty lucky, I started smoking weed at 14- around the same time I discovered my parents had been doing it for the past 20 years. They discovered when I was 15 and let me smoke in the house. Their attitude was &#039;at least we know where you are, who you buy from and what you&#039;re doing&#039;. Their approach to parenting left me with nothing to rebel against, so I was a pretty well behaved teenager. I was also lucky enough to have some frank discussions with them about their own drug use in the &#039;70&#039;s (acid, speed and opium). <br /><br />Whilst I was fascinated by drugs and academically pursued the subject, I had no real desire to try anything other than weed until I was nearly 20. My parents have never fully approved of my other drug use but I&#039;ve always been open with them and they&#039;ve become more accepting. <br />For example, MDMA was almost unknown in the UK when they were younger so they have always leaned towards the &#039;one hit could kill you&#039; side of the argument. However, now they know that I take it (I&#039;ve even taken it around them, at a festival last year)- they&#039;re more relaxed about it and recognize that it&#039;s a relatively benign drug.<br /><br />I would suggest that you talk openly to your parents about drugs, but don&#039;t force the issue. If it comes up in conversation, then talk neutrally about drugs- both the benefits and possible negative effects. Show them articles about drugs, but not pro or anti drug propaganda. If they ask you if you&#039;ve tried &#039;xxx&#039; then be honest and tell them about the experience. Show them you&#039;re responsible, rational and educated. Try to educate them too.

				If you can&#039;t, you&#039;re probably not. <br />But if parents are really that reactionary, irrational and untrusting of their adult children then they don&#039;t deserve to know what their kids get up to.

				I started smoking weed when I was around 12 years old, and I&#039;m 46 now.&nbsp; My parents found out when I was around 15.&nbsp; They didn&#039;t like it, but at the time there wasn&#039;t much they could do about it.&nbsp; I was a good student, played on a varsity sports team, sat first chair in the band.&nbsp; I had a part time job. Put myself through college.&nbsp; Bought a home.<br /><br />Now they kind of accept it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not stoned all the time.&nbsp; Its not the focus of my life.&nbsp; Its like, some people have a couple beers to have fun, I choose a small puff or edible.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m old enough to start seeing it as medicine.&nbsp; HELL maybe it WAS medicine all that time and I didn&#039;t even know it (aka self medication).&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m not burnt out.&nbsp; I don&#039;t look like a bum.&nbsp; I look average.&nbsp; I&#039;m educated with a good job.&nbsp; My life is manageable. <br /><br />However when your life becomes unmanageable and the drugs are your main focus, that&#039;s when you tell your dad and ask him to help you quit.&nbsp; Until then, its like jerking off.&nbsp; Everyone knows you are doing it, but no one is going to talk about it.

				Try to be the best damn person you can be. Get good grades, be polite, kind and caring. Take care of your physical appearance. If they see that you&#039;re not the junkie they believe you&#039;ll become, perhaps they will get off your case.

				If you live with your father, then i wouldn&#039;t tell him. If you don&#039;t, then gather all facts about the drug you use. Effects on body,mind, damage it may cause ECt. Then prove your point. Weigh the pros and cons. Good Luck

				Honestly, the easiest way to regain their respect is to stop using the drugs. <br /><br />If you want to keep using the drugs and still have their respect, you have to compensate by achieving difficult tasks. <br /><br />So, how what&#039;s the hardest thing you could do to gain your parents&#039; respect besides discontinuing your drug use?<br /><br />Sorry, I know it sucks to hear that, but those are your only options.

				I&#039;ll chime in here. If you are under 18 maybe you should chill out on drugs until you are a little older, let the ol&#039; brain develop a little first. Other than that, I believe it&#039;s your choice to use drugs. I love how everyone who is against legalization is also an alcoholic or a smoker, they usually sit on their high horse with there martini&#039;s looking down their noses on people who do as little as smoke pot. I&#039;ll tell you one thing, I am a science major who smokes pot every single day, even before major tests and class, and I am on the president&#039;s list. So don&#039;t listen to what others tell you is right, because most of the laws have been put in place to keep you in place. Just don&#039;t kill yourself in the process, people love to use the statistics of drug abuse to justify the means.

				I dunno...sometimes there is no way to convince a parent to think otherwise. The ones that would of accepted your drug use would of gave in a long time ago. I think there comes a point when lecturing and trying to teach them that drugs are &quot;okay&quot; is fruitless. Drugs are bad. We can&#039;t kid our selves here. Smoking weed, snorting pills, dropping acid, drinking alcohol are all bad for you. Yes, many stoners will try and convince themselves that weed is different, &quot;it&#039;s the safe drug!&quot; There are no safe drugs. Drugs are drugs and no matter what you say they are bad for you physically and mentally. The only problem is who has the right to say you can&#039;t do what you want to your own mind and body? In the end you are responsible for yourself, and no one else. I do drugs because I love to get high, and that&#039;s all there is to it. You can glorify it, make it into art, but in the end it&#039;s just getting high. So please, don&#039;t fool yourself that there is a way to make using drugs look good in the minds of your parents. It won&#039;t work.
