				Let me begin by saying this is the most social/functional psychadelic I&#039;ve ever consumed. Normally if I were to consume a substance on blotter tabs i&#039;d be chillin too fucked up to go out and be seen by anybody. Tonight was different. First time with DOC was a mad successsssssss!<br /><br />As soon as I start feelin the DOC hit me, I can tell it&#039;s different. It&#039;s super duper uplifting and I feel like I just want to talk to people. You know save the world n shit. So I decide let&#039;s be adventurous. Let&#039;s hop in the car and just do whatever the fuck comes to mind. No holds barred. Pornstar status. I start cruisin&#039; down the street and at this point I know exactly what you&#039;re thinking. What kind of music is this crazy mother fucker listening to? ACDC Back in Black. First thing I noticed that was just a slight departure from everyday life was when I rolled up to a busy intersection. Red light means stop, so I stopped.... What followed is an epic tale of heroic proportions. Fucking disco lights start pulsing to Back in Black and I feel like I&#039;m back in the 1980s raging my face off at an ACDC concert. This is all while I&#039;m stopped at a red light. <br /><br />So the light turns green and instantly the disco lights are turned off and i&#039;m back to driving mode. What to do next? Tonight has already been champion status. Well I decide, fucking out of the blue, to feed the local bum that&#039;s always under the overpass by the highway. I know what you&#039;re thinking at this point as well.... &quot;Dude, you&#039;re fucking insane. That&#039;s a bum and you&#039;re on psychadelics. He&#039;s going to stab you for sure.&quot; That&#039;s where your wrong. This is not you&#039;re typical scary looking H addict bum. He&#039;s always smiling and just so happy looking. I know for sure he&#039;s not harmful... So I start thinking to myself, self.... If a bum were to die and go to heaven, what would he ask for on his first meal? CHICK-FIL-A. I decided this lucky man was going to get a feast tonight. I stocked the fuck up on good ol&#039; fashion southern-peanut-oil-0transfat-deliciousness (+ a large sweet tea) and was off on my merry way to the overpass. When I got there, I parked at the gas station across the street and walked over. 2 bags of food in hand (+ a large sweet tea). At this point a little bit of nervousness set in. I was like uhhhhhh what the fuck am I doing? lol I am walking up to a homeless man with 2 chicken sandwhiches and a sweet tea. WHAT THE FUCK? It was too late to question my motives at that point, though. I had to press on with the task at hand. Courage in the line of fire, you know what I mean? So I walk up and introduce myself to him and tell him why I&#039;m there. He goes on with this story about how this is probably the coolest thing that&#039;s happened to him in years. Dude just couldn&#039;t stop laughing at what was going on. He was delivered Chick-Fil-A by some random white boy trippin the fuck out on what I told him was acid (I didn&#039;t have time to explain what DOC was). In retrospect, this was a pretty fucking hilarious moment, but I was also sincerely touched by his reaction. Glad I brought a smile and full belly to someone tonight. I&#039;ve done a lot of bad things in my life and maybe this makes up for some of &#039;em, you know?<br /><br />Anyway... That brings me up to the car ride home and this very spot where I am typing right now for your viewing/reading pleasure. I just popped these bad boys about 2 hours ago and I feel like I&#039;m wasting a lot of my fuel here.... I need to get back out on the road and see what kind of trouble I get into next. More stories to follow.... Say a prayer I don&#039;t get arrested.

				Yessiree. This magical substance was from SR. redhempfield or something like that... I can&#039;t remember off the top of my head and I feel like there are so many activities I could be doing right now instead of logging into SR. I will find out for you fo sho though. I took one 2mg tab and I will tell ya... the visuals aren&#039;t really there (it&#039;s more of a mental trip + lights are fucking intenseeeeee), but I have never ingested a substance (with the exception of maybe my first few times rolling) where I am this clear headed, able to function/be around people/etc and be so fucking happy haha

				OK so I&#039;m back and this time I think I&#039;ma just stay in and chill out hahaha I have had enough good times for one night. <br /><br />Part II of my DOXploration:<br /><br />I figure keep up with the good vibes man. You just made some stranger&#039;s night. I was back in my car thinking of what to do next... all the while jimi hendrix is playing in the background. He is shredding some fuckin gnarly ass tunes in&nbsp; my car. I feel like he&#039;s sitting right behind me playing. And he tells me... &quot;Son... Go forth and deal out vigilante justice to evil doers the world over.&quot; What a fucking cool mission. I mean seriously... Could you ask for a more badass mission? Instantly all these thoughts ran through my head. I saw myself as this kevlar-clad bad ass mother fucker. I even had a suit that had FUCKING MUSCLES stitched into the kevlar. That&#039;s when you know you&#039;ve made it to the top in the super hero business. My cape was long and flowing... slung upon my back was my weapon of choice. It was designed specially for dealing out punishment to dickheads. It was this flaming guitar-hammer. Imagine Braveheart-style shit, but with flames and classic rock. Ya.... Fucking awesome huh?<br /><br />So here I was with this mental image blazed into my brain. What&#039;s the next logical conclusion? I need a squad of equally fucking badass vigilante fighters to mete out justice with me in the dead of night. I proceed to stop at the neighborhood watering hole to recruit elite squad members and/or look out for injustice. I parked my car and stroll up to the front feeling like I own the place. The bad dudes better not fuck with me tonight because I will upload some ju-do to my arms/legs Matrix style and unleash a can of unholy whoopass. <br /><br />Well that&#039;s about where all the badassness ended. I strolled into the bar lol and I felt as if a big spotlight went right over me and everybody in there was staring at me. I still can&#039;t really tell if I was just tripping the fack out or if people really were looking at me like &quot;What the fuck is up with this dude?&quot;.... Anyway. At that moment, I knew I had to cut my mission short. Tonight was maybe not the night to deal out destruction to the forces of evil. Then I came back home and started typing on this here &#039;puter. Kind of anti-climactic right? Definitely... BUT lesson learned. Trying to figure out what that lesson is.... When I do I&#039;ll get back to ya&#039;ll.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Pinkster

				LOL Good to have you still with us. As for the lesson... I would say it would be ... hm... I&#039;m not even sure. But I&#039;m def glad you didn&#039;t walk in and start swinging pool cues n shit. Sometimes badassery means doing nothing. Leave people to their own devices. Assholes will usually serve up their own punishments. It&#039;s a far greater punishment, imo.

				In retrospect, last night was pretty awesome. If you&#039;re looking to trip face seeing fractals n stuff everywhere with your eyes open, take two or three of these. One was a perfect dose for all around fun. I&#039;ve yet to try LSD (which is actually on the way from jackie chan starting monday) but this was one of the top psychadelic experiences I&#039;ve ever had. I did mescaline which was it&#039;s own little world of fun... Shrooms, 2cc and 25c. DOC was definitely different. I was surprised that I was able to drive so well lol.<br /><br />Ergo and shadowknight... both of ya&#039;ll need to get on dis shit here and adventure!!!!

				Comedown/side effect was not bad at all. I didn&#039;t even notice anything. I read a bunch of trip reports online and I think that what you might be referring to as bad side effects came from people just taking flat out too much. A lot of the reports I read online had kids taking 5mg + at once. At these higher dosages I think it lasts MUCH longer and it is easier to get trapped in a bad cycle haha. This stuff is semi-amphetamine in nature. Later on in the night after I was coming down, I wanted to bring some of the feeling back so I drank a 5 hour energy. This made me feel slightly uncomfortable and I was super aware of my heartbeat. Simple answer: don&#039;t mix this stuff with other drugs except maybe weed (which I didn&#039;t do, so I wouldn&#039;t know).&nbsp; The blotter I purchased was 2mg, and i only had 1. I would think you would not want to take more than 1.5/2 blotters:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b027ebf7f8<br /><br />that is who I bought it from. As for the music.... I would say music was one of the best parts. I was jamming the fuck out. Hendrix/electro all goddamned night.<br /><br />Happy Trails you guys :)

				I feel like I should add this lil caveat as well:<br /><br />I have a good bit of experience with heavy psychadelics-- mescaline, shrooms, 2cc, and 25c-nbome. Each consumed more times than I can count (except mescaline haha that stuff was always pretty rare). With that said, I do not have a high tolerance to psychs. I don&#039;t really do too many drugs anymore, mostly just dabble here and there. So if you are doing psychs every weekend or more, I would suggest trying out two. If you want to play it safe or just have a very functional trip take one only.<br /><br />cheers,<br /><br />Pinks

				Quick question! How do you use blotters? If I bought a full sheet of blotters now I wouldn&#039;t know what to do with it.<br /><br />I apologize for the extremely n00b question, but it&#039;s always better to ask, or so I was taught.

				that&#039;s a pretty cool story. a few weeks ago i was tripping on acid, and a homeless guy asked me for some weed, instead i gave him a hit of acid which i happened to have in my pocket. he happily ingested it, but then he started following me around everywhere, even up to my house. i got very paranoid and he ruined my trip. :( i&#039;m glad yours went better
