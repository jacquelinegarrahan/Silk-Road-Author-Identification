				basically for the duration of June, July, and August I&#039;m going to experiment with psychedelics for 3 months because this is probably the last Summer I&#039;ll have all the free time in the world. So far I&#039;m planning on purchasing:<br /><br />5x LSD tabs (250ug each)<br />25x 25i-Nbome tabs (1mg each)<br />1g Ketamine (I know Keta is considered a dissociative but whatever)<br />Maybe shrooms<br /><br />anyone feel I&#039;m really missing out on anything significant? Any advice on how to get the best out of the experience is welcome (i.e. best places to trip when on certain things, best things to do when tripping etc.)&nbsp; ;D

				I tried 2c-b 3 times and came to the conclusion it wasn&#039;t for me.&nbsp; The first time I took it I had a local pill estimated at around 12mgs on pill reports. I took it with mdma and had a good time. The second time I found a pill from the same batch a year later and tried it and for some reason it didn&#039;t produce any effects? I took another one the next day and it hit me. I find that 2c-b makes me feel uncomfortable inside. A couple of weeks later I tried LSD for the first time and I realized that the visuals had some similarities to 2c-b but the whole experience is on another level. Maybe the 2c-b I tried wasn&#039;t the best who knows but I&#039;ll always choose lsd over 2c-b :P

				For me low doses of 2c-b (15mg) makes me feel sorta uncomfortable however 20-35mg is a great experience for me.

				25i-NBOME - Visual swirling, rainbow bands of color on white backgrounds, lots and lots of noticed patterns and textures, but not too many hallucinations, at least for me, aside from really amazing sound-&gt;color synesthesia when music is played.&nbsp; Also, it&#039;s highly confusing, and you&#039;ll feel lost and confused on it no matter what, so give 500ug a try to understand the confusion, and then redose when you&#039;re comfortable with being confused.&nbsp; It removes your psychological defense mechanisms and doesn&#039;t teach you anything that you aren&#039;t prepared to search for on your own, so don&#039;t go in expected to be guided by the chemical.&nbsp; It goes really well with MDMA, though. :D

				A few more things you need is some 2C-E and Diphenhydramine, along with some benzos to keep your sleep schedule consistent. Plenty of bud is great for enhancing the trips once they begin to die down too. ;)<br /><br />Like the rest said, buy some 2C-B and DMT. DMT is just magical during any psychedelics peak. Definitely get some shrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, they&#039;re just too much fun to pass up!

				Up your stash dude- Im at the end of a current similar experiement- I like where your head is at so far but let me make some suggestions:<br /><br />-DMT (lots of it- I don&#039;t know what your planning on doing during your adventures, but I find this is always a good thing to have)<br /><br />-Xanax (Just in case)<br /><br />-2C-B (easily my favorite 2c- not overly crazy, very mellow happy trip, good for pretty much any situation- FoxyMeow had some smarties up a few months ago that were perfect, but hes on vaca or what not)<br /><br />-Weed (of course)<br /><br />-More Acid (5 may last 2 festivals... maybe)<br /><br />Have a Blast be safe- listen to your mind enjoy the adventure and don&#039;t do it for nothing- get inspired- Find something special you may be overlooking- whats that thing kids used to write in the yearbooks...

I like the mindset and cognitive boost LSD provides for me; would I still achieve this from 25I?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yes.&nbsp; I have given samples to a couple of people and every single one loved it, and wanted more!&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; There is certainly a lot of associative and creative thinking.&nbsp; One night I listened to psybient music and painted.&nbsp; My mind had never felt more open or creatively charged.&nbsp; It&#039;s a beautiful compound.&nbsp; The visuals are out of this world, and it&#039;s so damn cheap!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been thinking about ordering some to try. Do you have any recommendations for a first time dose? How would it fare at a festival or a rave (not the first time, but after I&#039;ve tried it once or twice)?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I cannot speak of the potency of anyone&#039;s tabs besides kwiktrip&#039;s.&nbsp; If you go with him, I would start with one tab, which is roughly 550ug.&nbsp; Take it on a relatively empty stomach, and you should start to come up within 25-50 minutes.&nbsp; Wait a bit, feel it out.&nbsp; Let the chemical kick in a bit more.&nbsp; If you like it at this point, I&#039;d say go for another tab if you want a more intense experience, but it still shouldn&#039;t be overwhelming, assuming you&#039;re not new to psychedelics.&nbsp; I think 25I-NBOMe would be perfect for festivals or raves.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure people buy it as acid at them all the time, which is unfortunate.&nbsp; It gives you a nice PEA rush, euphoria, and awesome visuals.&nbsp; RC candyflipping with this stuff is INSANE.&nbsp; I was dancing for 12 hours straight!&nbsp; The trails of glow sticks...I&#039;ve never been more enchanted.&nbsp; The only con of this combo is the NBOMe overpowers the MDMA just a little.&nbsp; Perhaps next time I will take the tab(s) first.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks so much for the advice mate. Appreciate it ;)
