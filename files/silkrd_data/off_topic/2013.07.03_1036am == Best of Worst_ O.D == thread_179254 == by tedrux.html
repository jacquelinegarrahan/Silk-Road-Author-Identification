				This would be called a disappearing act because its when you get &quot;T.O.D O.D.&#039;d&quot; (time of death/ over dosing)<br />I&#039;m basically wondering<br />What pill is easiest to accidentally overdose on (to death, we&#039;re assuming) and how much roughly do you have to take (known quantities as well as ld50 &amp;ld95&#039;s <br />What pill is easiest to transition with (the dying process) while getting todod?&nbsp; Is there one where you will simply fall asleep and die without pain? <br />What is the least expensive way to O.D. ?<br />What sources are available on the road?<br />for those disturbed by this post due to my history of comments just be aware it doubles for those who wish to push the limits and might not even know what the limits are or for those who never gave it a thought. any suicide instruction is as easily a guide for how not to. we all have a right to choose anyways and honestly why not give info on the painless suicide and drive people to more hazardess and painful methods? <br />-teddy

				You&#039;re still going on with this? You&#039;ve posted so many threads here asking about various ways to commit suicide and about intense drugs you&#039;ve never experienced. Dude, literally everything you have asked on these forums can be easily found by googling it. I guarantee you if you googled &quot;What pill is the easiest to OD on&quot;, you would get hundreds if not thousands of results answering that very question.<br /><br />If you had any interest in committing suicide, you would have by now. You keep trying to convince yourself that suicide is the right thing to do, when its not. Instead of trying to buy various chemicals on SR to kill yourself with, go up to your kitchen and take a look. Right away you&#039;ll see a dozen different tools you could accomplish that desire of yours with.<br /><br />But you wont. You don&#039;t want to commit suicide, that&#039;s quite clear. Maybe your conscience has convinced you that you do, but you really don&#039;t.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to consider every post you do involving suicide a troll, Ive noticed a lot of people have stopped responding to your topics too. Get over yourself and grow up, there&#039;s more to life then thinking about your last breath all the time.

				Adding to what Internal Freedom said, this is a pretty obvious attention seeking post.&nbsp; There is a vast amount of information regarding euthanasia which requires you to type exactly 10 letters into google to obtain, however instead you make a post which probably took at least 10 minutes to type up.<br /><br />Morphine is whats used for &quot;unofficial&quot; euthanasia in hospitals, however from memory, we used something called &quot;green dream&quot; on the wildlife we had to euthanase when I was a kid.

				Whatever life has thrown at you - you got to escape some things but you don&#039;t have to bail out of planet earth to find some &#039;freedom&#039; or a bit of peace of mind.<br /><br />A buddy of mine, actually tried to take his own life. He used sleeping tablets. He slept for 24 hr then woke up feeling so bad that we all bailed in and paid for him to get off to a &#039;retreat&#039;. Its just a field we go to in the middle of nowhere. A few days there he cleared his head out - confessed his blues and chose to live instead.<br /><br />We only get one life. Forget all the complicated shit - all we need is a bit of love - some work, some playtime and something to beleive in.<br /><br />I was a doomsday boy myself when young. Sometimes you think life is just shit. Sometimes it is but we all take a little bit of shit in life sometime. Try not to become bitter over it. Let the past go bro - and as for life - you just got to live it and find your own footing. <br /><br />Today might suck - tomorrow you might meet someone special. But you really need to get out and about. I&#039;d leave the online &#039;dating&#039; alone. It seems wierd to me that you would send a photo of your dick/whatever before even saying &#039;Hi, my name is Slim Shady&#039;.<br /><br />Forget the OD shit bro. I know were your coming from - not trying to belittle you. Been there, done that and wore the T Shirt which said &#039;I hate life&#039;. <br /><br />Now I like life. Sometimes its great. Mostly its a daily grind to earn enough to live and play but I advise anyone against &#039;growing up&#039; too much. Act like a kid sometimes. Climb a tree, scare some chick with a frog, stay out all night around a campfire.<br /><br />If anything, my OD advise is 3 grams of hash. It will kill off your ego. Its the ego which leads you to take this life too seriously. <br /><br />As Bill Hicks the American comedian of the century told us about life...<br /><br />&quot;Its only a ride&quot;<br /><br />Enjoy that ride!<br /><br />Its bright, loud, scary sometimes, but its only a ride!<br /><br />PS, I had a bleak view of life until I lit up my first joint. Found a natural anti stress relief! <br /><br />
