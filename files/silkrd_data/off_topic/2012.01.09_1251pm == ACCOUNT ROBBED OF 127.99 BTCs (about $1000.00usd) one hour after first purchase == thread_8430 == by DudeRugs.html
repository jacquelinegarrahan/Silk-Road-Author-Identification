				Last night I bought my first BitCoins after spending nearly 3 months learning the ropes and making sure I wasn&#039;t jumping into someone&#039;s scam. After a lot of debate I finally took the plunge and bought $1000.00usd worth of Bitcoins.. everything went great! Then about an hour after the coins reached my account they suddenly disappeared. I frantically checked the transaction log to see the a user called &quot;doug00100&quot; had made a custom listing for the precise amount of coins in my account (127.99) and without my consent the transaction was completed. Needless to say I feel like I want to vomit right now, especially since I can&#039;t get SR support to respond to me to save my life. A couple users told me that they would be able to get the funds back but I have very little hope at this point and just hope nobody else has to get hit like I did. And I have started another account to message SR support from in an effort to get a faster reply. Oh and after I realized what had happened it was but a couple seconds before I was locked out of the account permanently. Luckily I had a second account I set up to use for selling. I just don&#039;t know what to do and feel like I got punched in the gut. Its hard to feel like I am part of a community when I know there are people like doug00100 just waiting around every corner to take me for everything I&#039;ve got. The money was literally what I was going to use to get my heat turned back on in my house.. oh well, gonna be another cold month I guess right? cowards

				Can someone please explain how this is possible?<br /><br />A rogue seller posts an item for sale, and is able to &quot;hack&quot; into a user&#039;s (victim) account to place and finalize an order thus robbing him???<br /><br />What am I missing here?<br /><br />

				I doubt the SR has anything to do with this.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely that DudeRugs has an infected computer or used one.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been online for many years with many sites/game/etc and the only time I&#039;ve ever been &quot;hacked&quot; is when I logged onto WoW at a co-workers house.&nbsp; Bastard had a keylogger!<br /><br />What I don&#039;t understand is that if the PIN is supposed to protect our coins if our account is hacked, why isn&#039;t it required to make purchases too?

				First off, sorry for going to sleep as soon as I made this thread. Secondly, to answer this recurring question, my account had been compromised due to some scammer obtaining my password. The thing that is the most troubling about ALL of this is that since this actually happened last night at around 11pm central-standard-time (almost 13 hours ago) I have yet to hear a single word back from the SR Support team. Maybe they can do something, maybe they can&#039;t. It would be nice at least for someone to contact me for two reasons.. 1)So that I can know one way or another if I need to start selling plasma. and 2)It would be nice to know that they are at least capable of acting like they give a shit at all. Maybe I am asking way too much here. It would be kinda nice to get my old account back also since once the fuckers took the money out there really isn&#039;t much they need it for. Oh well, I need to go do something to take my mind off of this before I feel like I have to puke again..

I am am big on security and encryption. Gotta know where you are and who you giving info too. Have any of your other accounts been compromised? How have you gotten a hold of SR through the forum or through you other account? Is your other SR account compromised? I hate to see something like this happen, but somethings just don&#039;t seem right.

				why the fuck would you buy $1000 in bitcoins when you needed the money to &quot;heat your house&quot; and now are forced to &quot;sell plasma&quot;?<br /><br />Thus is the downside of being a drug dealer.

				someone really needs to make a sticky thread called &quot;Silk Road 101&quot; for noobs.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Rule 1. Always make sure you have the correct link to SR so you arent password phished. http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion<br />Rule 2. Never Transfer more money to your account than you plan to immediately spend. <br />Rule 3. Never Spend Large amounts with vendors you&#039;ve never dealt with before, especially new vendors with no, or low feedback.<br />Rule 4. Always work within the escrow system and try not to finalize ealry unless the vendor has a good reputation.<br />Rule 5. ?

				my first thoughts were this<br /><br />You say you were scouting around here for 3 mounths, were you posting things in here? This part of the web is loaded with scammers and a new face is what they go after. Before you know the ropes about how to keep yourself safe, they are workin away tryin to get your security info, waiting for the day when you take the plunge and get a bunch of coin<br /><br />When you did this, they have allready had your info for a few mounths and take your coin<br /><br />It hapened a bunch to me when I was new here, got taken for coin every time I&nbsp; turned around, every step I took it seemed like they new I would go there, who knows maybe I was a fish caught on their hook going to places they realed me into<br /><br />Anyways Ive learned how to protect my stuff, change password 3 times a day and things like that

				Man.. some of you guys are kinda assholes. That is not directed at the SR community, just the losers who try to act like they belong to a community. You see, thing about community is.. when one person gets dealt a bad hand, the rest of the community just simply listens and is there for that person. When I made this post I was pretty upset. And to clear something up, I didn&#039;t lose the money for my heat bill when I got robbed. I used the money for my heat bill to setup my sellers account and to transfer as many bitcoins to my account that I could get together so that maybe I could recoup some of my losses once those products arrived. <br /><br />Now, to straighten some other people out. Yes, I did research and browse the forums and vendors for about 3 months before making my first move. I was very anal about doing everything as safely as possible. Where I slipped up was not changing my password before I made my transaction. I know $1000 seems like a lot of money to put in right off the bat, but I already knew what I was going to spend it on and was simply comparing a few listings that were up at the time before I actually purchased any. I was logged on the entire time between deposit to theft to lock-out. The money was a pool of funds put together by people I know and we knew the risks going in, but whether we knew the risks or not, losing $1000 stings regardless of the situation. <br /><br />AND LASTLY! Not once, NOT ONCE, have I asked for anything other than moral support from what I considered a community. Yeah, one person did offer to send me something. What that is I haven&#039;t the slightest idea. But what I can tell you is that I already had every intention of buying through this person before he was gracious enough to offer me what he did. Maybe some of you think the right thing to do would be to not accept it, maybe some of you are just mad that you weren&#039;t given anything. Either way, I lost $1000 and the gift I am receiving is only going to be paid forward(which is how I was taught to do when someone helps you without being asked to) as soon as I am able to. I finally got a message from SR today saying that they have got my original account back, and that I can use it again should I choose. So if its that big of a deal to some of you, I am sure that there is a way I could prove to you that it actually happened and I am not the piece of shit you think I am. In fact, since starting the sellers account I have been really enjoying this site and look forward to being around, offering fair prices and providing quality service. But believe me, I am making a list of each of the people who were so quick call me the scammer I&#039;m not.. :)<br /><br />Lastly

				I saw a thread like this the other day, and the user got a few freebees from a well known, kind seller. So I assume this guy is just hoping that someone will take pity on him and throw a few freebees his way. Even though he will decline my accusation. Just my opinion.<br /><br />If not, you got phished. Quit downloading software off of youtube.

				Well I wasn&#039;t trying to sketch anyone out.. mainly just explaining how I got took so it doesn&#039;t need to happen to someone else. Since then things have been going really well. I have made multiple deposits, and multiple purchases/sales and have not had anything go wrong yet. I don&#039;t want to scare anyone away, just let them know what types of scams are out there.
