				Probably need to find out what she likes. Does she like the cerebral trippy high of sativas or the heavier stone of indicia? Or a combination? That would help in picking a strain. If she&#039;s not an experienced user the concentrates might be a little too much and easy to overdo.

				If you are looking for just a bit of weed for your girl, then check out Lionware Trading Post.&nbsp; They sell strains that a lot of other vendors don&#039;t have, their stealth is great, and the bag appeal is definitely there.&nbsp; Pricey, but I&#039;d be willing to bet after a few hits of their headband, you may just get some head your own self.

				interesting how everybody assumes OPs SO is female... <br /><br />would be easier to recommend a vendor if we knew where you are located.<br />you might also want to have a look at the edibles section. there are some really potent and tasty treats out there.(birthday cake ;) )<br /><br /><br />cheers<br /><br />

				LOL He has been a heavy daily smoker when possible..hasnt met many drugs he doesnt like..except opiates..and I dont like the effects of the one he likes most in recent years, mdpv...bleah..<br /><br />He has had times where he was smoking moldy brick weed...hash more recently, of a decent quality.<br /><br />Looking thru all the vendors and stuff available I just wanted some personal recommendations..and thanks for the ones you guys gave me! <br /><br />He is a constant worry, high anxiety type, so IDK if that would lead to one type of thc over another? I know he is anti edibles, and frankly I am also looking for cost effective, seemed the hash and ear wax was good for that...<br /><br />
