				Fuck me was it nice.&nbsp; Sea views, 3 star hotel, okay not 5 but fuck me the crumpet was amazing.<br />Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that these hotels only seem to employ sexy good looking people???<br />Should i be angry about that lol <br />But no seriously, if you want a good couple of days away, check out Portsmouth.&nbsp; Although, i was a pussy and chickened out of going up the Spinnaker Tower, but its like 100 meters up.

Most shit holes have a sense of deluded pride; people have come to know their locale and will defend it as if a part of themselves.

				LOL! You should have gone up the spinnaker tower man, the views are amazing. Plus, theres a glass floor on one of the floors you can walk over and look down, pretty neat when the people scared of heights are grabbing onto the rail slowly making their way over it shaking like a leaf and with a bright pale face sick with the fear of heights and you start jumping up and down on the glass. I made lots of friends that day. ;)&nbsp;

				The spinnaker tower looked fucking immense when i was right up close.&nbsp; Yet the leaflets say its &quot;only&quot; 100 meters??.<br />Anyways after a few beers i was like &quot;yeah fuck it, tomorrow we are gonna do it&quot;<br />Then the next day arrived, i was sober, for a change, took one look up at the top and already started feeling dizzy.<br />I was &quot;forced&quot; to go on the london eye once as part of a surprise on my mothers birthday.&nbsp; <br />Fuck me, i never moved away from that wooden seating area in the middle of the capsule.<br />I wish there was a way i could get over my fear of heights.&nbsp; Stick me on a plane though, and im fine.&nbsp; <br />Is that strange or what??

				Ah man yeah the plane thing is strange but my auntie is exactly same. She can&#039;t even walk up a flight of stairs in the local shopping centre without shitting houses bless her. <br />Apparently you can get psychotherapy that cures it. Probably extremely overpriced though..<br />

				Yeah, i feel for your auntie there mate.<br />At portsmouth there was a fucking skyscraper that was all just glass, and i reckon it was well over 100 meters.<br />Towards the top end there were fucking stairs on the OUTSIDE, presumably for fire escapes.<br />But yeah i had a friend who went to a proper, Paul Mckenna type hypnotist and he charged well over a grand, that was for smoking.
