				Hahaha, I know of the situation that you mention. If the people aren&#039;t too keen to the symptoms of pupil dilation and you can control your behavior fairly well, I say go for it :)

				You don&#039;t lose any self-control with MDMA. You can act as normal as you want to. But you won&#039;t want to act normal.

				OK, the best recommendation I can make is NOT to take it with other people around...especially if they are themselves not doing any substances.<br /><br />I used to roll at dance parties, but then I realized that all I wanted to do is curl up with my loved one on a couch and spin my own records...<br /><br />Safe and sane that way!<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC&#039;s...<br /><br />Omega<br /><br />

				It&#039;s not like a psychedelic, you aren&#039;t going to be irked by the presence of other people whether they are sober or not. You are going to love everybody and everybody is going to love you. <br /><br />My opinion is that you should save it for something special. You will never roll as good as your first time. I so wish I saved my first roll for a rave or concert, instead of just being alone in my room playing audiosurf..<br /><br />(Not to imply that wasn&#039;t still one of the best nights of my life)

				As everyone else said you&#039;ll be fine, but I personally would recommend rolling for the first time with a group of people, it makes the experience much better imo. Either way you will have a great time though 8)

				Aha cheers. What i was thinking is that im going to be doing this thing with them for the whole day, not going to go into detail but it will be as boring as fuck. Might make it a bit more &#039;interesting&#039;, but if not i have a couple grams of coke to use.<br /><br />We&#039;ll see&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br />Locker.

				It&#039;ll probably be obvious that somethings up with you, but not that you&#039;re necessarily on drugs. You&#039;re going to love everybody though, like the others have said, and your pupils are going to be huge as fuck if you&#039;re like me. ;D Oh yeah, don&#039;t be scared if you notice your dicks shrunk, because that&#039;s a common side-effect and it&#039;ll come back to life in a few hours.

				The first time my brother did it was at Christmas time, and he was the life of the party.&nbsp; I think everyone was too polite to mention the appearance of his eyes, but the dilation did not last too long, I guess.&nbsp; My first time was at the best party of my life, which in every way was nearly perfect.&nbsp; I imagine that you are going to have a great time, and if your friends don&#039;t mind being the recipients of all your affection and joy, they are going to really enjoy it too!

				Share it with a close friend/ FB who hasn&#039;t tried before. <br />200mg pill is decent hit.<br /><br />Enjoy it!
