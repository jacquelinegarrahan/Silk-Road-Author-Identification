				Yo,<br /><br />Currently on holidays partner gets back in 4 days so I&#039;m as free as a bird. <br /><br />Here is my predicament I ran out of meth about 12 hours ago, which bums me and I don&#039;t have any BTC and by the time I do get BTC It won&#039;t be delivered in time for me to consume. Currently I&#039;am really craving stimulants namely speed but anyways.<br /><br />Anything consumed will be done so by myself at home. <br /><br />Supplies at this stage are<br /><br />1g of MDMA (taken plenty but not recently)<br />10 or so LSD (taken a few times, lost its magic for me though)<br />5 25c-nbome tabs @ 450ug (never taken before)<br />10 mushie caps (never taken before)<br />2 grams of Hash (never taken before, but had bud plenty of times)<br />Benzos including kpins, xanax and valium.<br /><br />How can I make the most of my holiday? What would you consume if you were in my shoes? <br /><br />EDIT - I got up at 4:30am on Sunday and started smoking shardy at 12 that day, slept for 4 hours that night and slept for 3 hours today, but don&#039;t feel tired at all, so maybe the shard is still going its magic. Should i drop a benzo tonight and start something new tomorrow?<br /><br />

				Taking the psychedelics on a comedown might give you a shitty trip and taking the MDMA just to satisfy your stimulant craving would be a waste. I suggest you drop a benzo and smoke some hash :D

				Do what I do in this situation. Make a plan of what you will take, then drop the first thing.<br />Screw the list and then just start dabbing in everything to &quot;see what its like&quot;.<br />4 days later your bird gets home and your eyes are buggin out of their sockets and you are talking absolute shite!<br /><br />Gf has found me in this state several mornings when she wakes up for work..........

				Ballzinator - Yeah I did about 3mg of xanax and slept for 11 hours feel better now, think the stimulant craving was from smoke shards for about 48 hours, that craving seems to have faded now though.<br /><br />zero effect - hahahahaha my gf would cut my dick off if she knew. I think today (early afternoon) I might do two caps of mdma then tomorrow If i feel fine I might try this 25C to be honest it scares me a bit but not sure whether it should?

				dont be afraid of Nbome&#039; they&#039;re a fantastic string on anyones bow.<br /><br />tripppppppppppppy shit, like LSD, just not as spiritually intense and meaningful; kaleidescopic visuals and tons of giggles; but i&#039;ve never come away feeling &#039;life changed&#039; or knowing something that i didnt before.
