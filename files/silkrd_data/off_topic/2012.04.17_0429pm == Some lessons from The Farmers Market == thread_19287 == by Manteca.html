				Hi all.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s truly unfortunate when things like this happen.&nbsp; In a better world (like one recently discussed at the Summit of the Americas) things like this wouldn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; So it goes, however.&nbsp; I suggest you read the court documents that were filed for the case.&nbsp; You can get them at http://www.scribd.com/doc/89690597/Willemsindictment-Filed-045.&nbsp; They paint a very telling picture of the business workings of the site.&nbsp; Excellent reading.&nbsp; If you do the math, they made most of their money off of expensive weed.&nbsp; The Feds made most of their case off LSD carrier weight and numbskulls.&nbsp; BUT who wants to do that shit?&nbsp; That&#039;s why I have boiled them down into digest for you guys.&nbsp; Here are the key lessons of this experience in question and answer format:<br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;Should I use Hushmail so be 5up3r secret?&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; &nbsp;No.&nbsp; Are you a numbskull?&nbsp; Hushmail has been known to disclose everything they know about you.&nbsp; For further information about Hushmail, start with googling &quot;The Hive bust.&quot;&nbsp; They are lilly-white Canadian jerks engaging in SECURITY THEATER.&nbsp; Say &quot;No&quot; to Hushmail.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;Should I use PGP to protect myself?&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s effective&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; YES.&nbsp; Well -- yes with a but.&nbsp; PGP, used correctly, is currently the BEST protection to protect against yourself against interception unwanted access to your messages.&nbsp; BUT, If you&#039;ve given your key to da LEO, it no longer works.&nbsp; It&#039;s a wiretap protection and nothing more.&nbsp; <br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;Should I send many thousands of dollars in wire transfers to the Netherlands?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer:&nbsp; Unless you want to brag about it -- no.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;If not the NL, what about a Panamanian offshore holding corporation?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer:&nbsp; Dude no.&nbsp; You don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; Wire transfers outside of your country are very suspicious.&nbsp; Even screenwriters know that.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do that shit.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;What about sending them to Brazil?&nbsp; That&#039;s cool, right?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer: Are you fucking serious?&nbsp; They sent money to Brazil AND Panama AND the Netherlands??&nbsp; Who the hell does that?&nbsp; How much?&nbsp; LIKE $150,000?? Wow.&nbsp; That&#039;s a lot.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &quot;Should I use Western Union or PayPal&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer:&nbsp; NO DUDE.&nbsp; No.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did they get busted for BitCoins?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The did not.&nbsp; They got busted for using Western Union, Panamanian wire transfers, and Dave Matthews Band references. <br />&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Should I openly share ANY of my online account information (Pecunix, Egold, MtGox)?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Answer:&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; Payment systems beyond BitCoin are always insecure!&nbsp; Pecunix will talk to da LEO and then tell them how shares were transferred to any number of addresses or exchanges, which leads them to more accounts, and then to YOU.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give these things out to untrusted parties.&nbsp; Ever.<br /><br />*&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;According to this case, do our security measures work well?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; Pretty much.&nbsp; They got these guys for committing wire fraud basically.&nbsp; That led them to the tangible person behind the screen.&nbsp; That and FUCKING HUSHMAIL are what made this an easy target.&nbsp; But once made easy prey, da LEO just did some easy undercover work and waited them out.&nbsp; As long as you and SR can stay anonymous, we all won&#039;t go down like these guys.&nbsp; It looks like TOR and bitcoin worked... for now... [sinister laughter]<br /><br />I hope my morning coffee rant has been helpful to you.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s been helpful to me.

If they are then compromised at any point the message will be revealed.<br /><br />For this reason, all incriminating correspondence should be destroyed ASAP, even if it is encoded. SR claims to do this, but you have no way of knowing if a vendor does.<br /><br />b) An efficient algorithm for cracking PGP is found. PGP is NOT unbreakable, it is just very difficult to break with current known methods. It is entirely possible that a better method has already been discovered and we just don&#039;t know it.<br /><br />The good news is that if, say, the US government did acquire a method for deciphering PGP, they would not use it for something so trivial as busting SR. Much better to keep it a secret and listen in on all sorts of conversations for as long as possible.<br /><br /><br />For those who think that&#039;s just a conspiracy... look into the origins of the algorithm PGP uses. It was actually discovered first by the British secret service, they just kept it a secret for 20 years!

				You forgot an important part of the FM fiasco:<br /><br />Don&#039;t play man in the middle between customers and vendors (site operators paying the vendors via the same non anonymous payment options they were taking money in with). Seriously, they were just asking to get busted doing this. They may as well have made a powerpoint presentation with all the bullet points painting a pretty map of all their transactions from customer to vendor.

				Anytime there is drugs and money there will be informants.&nbsp; In spite of protests to the contrary, when busts start going down, seems people are always quick to want to give up their dealers.&nbsp; And if you read thru the indictment, you&#039;ll see that this was true here, also, and I&#039;m totally sure there are and will be, many more trying to make deals, to avoid prison.<br /><br />The great genius of SR, is that they have protected their vendors, and don&#039;t rely at all upon &#039;honor among thieves&#039; which, sadly, it seems was the case in TFM.&nbsp; <br /><br />The weak spot on SR is that vendors can give up buyers...besides hoping vendors never get in that position, it does make me worry about the periodic scammers and ripoffs on here, who I&#039;ve thought often could also be LE or snitches just trying to get a bunch of our addresses...but even so, it would make just about an impossible court case, as long as we held our mud, and went to court, rather than get all freaked out and cop pleas.&nbsp; &nbsp;And busting a bunch of low level buyers who can&#039;t give anybody up?&nbsp; Would they really want to do that?<br /><br />Interesting legal situation, anyway...but btc changes our situation huge...with the exception being the idiots who go outside btc on here...*bad* move.

				Adam was centralized, and everybody selling on his board had to pay 25% in fees to him whenever they made a sale.<br />He did a lot of private sales, I&#039;d say more like 1.5 million a year he was making.. not the 1 million the DEA claim from 2007-2009, that was probably just orders on the site. Problem with being centralized is there is one insecure Hushmail account to seize and get at all the shipping addresses for his &quot;deputies&quot; as the news called them in the US. Easy to round up.&nbsp; <br /><br />Adam would send 25k worth of drugs via ocean freight to vendors in the US to resell. He did this for years until they started getting seized and he gave up on shipping to the US all together and just let the locals do their own sourcing. He supposedly &quot;retired&quot; a few years ago, guess that was not the case. Keysh or whoever that was (they were arrested too) ran the Tor forums and was their site coder. Security through obscurity, they thought if they split the board because somebody kept posting the address on the hidden wiki that they would be safe. Problem is onlinepot.org still has his advertisement up, and Adam would send you a full menu AND link to the hidden store by emailing it, so no idea why he cared about the hidden wiki when he was wide open anyways.<br /><br />None of the information entered in their store was encrypted. There is a huge list for the DEA to go through but unless it&#039;s trafficking quantities they won&#039;t care. All the arrests that were gonna happen, already happened. They don&#039;t announce an operation while there&#039;s still people they want to arrest obviously so they don&#039;t destroy evidence.&nbsp; They swooped in and arrested everybody on the same day practically could have easily kept it quiet and still ran the board for entrapment but they didn&#039;t.<br /><br />Adam hired paypal cashiers who forwarded him Western Union and bank wires. Really bad security. Brazil is the worst place in the world to send/receive bank wires, all banks are heavily monitored by the state. Might as well be use US bank accounts.<br /><br />He thought that by catering to the mouth breathing masses of morons who can&#039;t figure out digital currency, he would make more money (greed) and be safe in the Netherlands even though they extradited Frankie and numerous other NL vendors over the years for selling LSD. He assumed his proxy of paypal and WU cashiers wouldn&#039;t sell him out at the first chance they got when staring down a life sentence for conspiracy to launder and traffic drugs. Wrong.<br /><br />Places like DutchGreenClub survive because they don&#039;t ship to the states. If you&#039;re taking Paypal and stupid shit don&#039;t ever send to the US, nobody will come after you. International law enforcement could give 2 fucks about online drug peddling. Only the US cares and makes them take action through LE treaties. <br /><br />Adam also originally started ravesupply@hushmail.com and his business partner some other Dutch guy ran away with the money so he started AdamFlowers by himself. I hope Adam is sending money to his US employees serving life sentences, because Adam will just go back to the Netherlands on a prison transfer request and walk free in a year or so. No doubt he has money hidden somewhere unless he really was stupid and used Hushmail backdoored services for everything.<br /><br />

This is one reason that I as the buyer am not really paranoid about being tracked down, I never order anything more than personal amounts of pills usually- shit that&#039; taken pretty quickly and nothing that sits around for weeks at a time. Why would the LE want me? I&#039;m nobody. Even if they did come busting down the door waiving a warrant what would they find? Nothing. No drugs, no evidence, no envelopes- nothing. What could they build a case around?&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe I am looking at this wrong, but I think most of us are such small time customers that we virtually have nothing to offer even.

				&quot;That&#039;s right.&nbsp; Assuming you followed &#039;perfect&#039; security protocols and kept your mouth shut&nbsp; (and no vendor turned on you), you&#039;d get scared shitless but the charges would be dropped.&nbsp; &nbsp;There would be no case.&nbsp; &nbsp;But not everyone will do this.&nbsp; Some will panic and snitch.&nbsp; Some will panic and confess.&nbsp; Some people&#039;s hard drives will be littered with evidence because they don&#039;t sanitize or use encryption.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some will turn into informants.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some will have mountains of evidence lying around (like the envelope for every single package they ordered).<br /><br />Security is only as good as the weakest link here, and the weakest link is not TOR or PGP .&nbsp; The weakest link is the human involved.<br />&nbsp;<br />There is a recent thread in the security section where a guy got &#039;busted&#039; for a couple of 20g shipments of MDMA from the NL , which customs seized on the way in, and there was an investigation, and search of his home.&nbsp; &nbsp;But the mail charges were dropped for lack of evidence tying the drugs to the money.<br /><br />That&#039;s really promising.<br /><br />BUT&nbsp; he did get charged for what he had lying around the house.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My opinion is there is too much heat here on SR to justify continuing.&nbsp; After TFM, the next logical target will be the Silk Road.<br /><br />Which is why I&#039;m out.&quot;<br /><br />Good points here, and this is why it&#039;s imperative to follow security measures at all times. As soon as I get my packages, they get shredded, my personal amounts are what I keep on hand however they can come from anyone. Even if a vendor did turn, who&#039;s to say if those packages that were allegedly ordered by me were were ever received? The way I see it, unless I am actually caught with the actual evidence in hand there is 0 proof. Even if I did get arrested I&#039;d simply deny and ask for a lawyer. If they decide they want to waste tax payers dollars over say a few orders of 10-20 V&#039;s then let&#039;s fuckin do it. A judge and jury would likely look at the docket and throw the shit out for it being a waste of time with virtually no evidence. And good luck explaining to some 40 year old stay a home mother what a bitcoin is and how it&#039;s obtained. <br /><br />

				It was stupid to take Paypal and the other forms of payment that they did, but the one thing that really stands out to me is how they were fucked by Hushmail.&nbsp; &quot;Private, secure&quot;?&nbsp; That&#039;s comical.&nbsp; All email providers who claim that their communications are safe and secure from prying eyes are deluding themselves.&nbsp; Once LE finds an online dealer they&#039;ll look for the email account he&#039;s using.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t matter what promises that email provider has made, it&#039;s all over once the DEA finds the email administrators.&nbsp; The DEA will flash warrants, make threats, and get what they want.&nbsp; <br /><br />Unless the admins of your email service just can&#039;t be found (Tormail) I would never trust the claims made by the email service you use.&nbsp;

				Use PGP with Tormail. Just in case TorMail was set up and run by the guv. Could say the same for SR.... What if SR was invented by LE because nobody else was getting it right? If you use PGP, even they don&#039;t have what they were looking for on their own machine... Using their own trap to get away with it. lol.<br /><br />I do wonder how easy it would be to pull traffic analysis on TorChat...<br /><br />When will people admit that the only way to put government back in it&#039;s place, is with the same force it uses against us?

				Amen to that.<br /><br />PGP seems a little extreme no?<br /><br />The reality remains the government cannot upload tor clients onto their machines because of the security risk and because of this the likelihood of them building a case on tor network based communications is little to nil. They would need the documents directly saved on a hard disk via notepad or word document in order to make it viable evidence.<br /><br />Imagine some body walking into langley with a torchain and uploading devil robber. <br /><br />Ludicrous

				Best not to panic too much. Main danger is LEO maybe catching a seller. Undercover cops are very good at what they do and it would be easy for some to hang about here, make purchases and so on. It is unlikely though. After all do cops hang out on child porn sites? Do they study Arabic to understand the tens of thousands of angst ridden chaps shouting about blowing up this and that. And the other!<br /><br />The cops may take anyone buying even a gram or so of heroin or coke for sure. If its there they will have it and easy arrests are the bread and butter for cops. The only way they can get that here is if a seller is caught with addresses. SR does not store them but some sellers might be using Microsoft Word to make labels which means that every address is actually stored away as far as I know. Its autosave which does this.<br /><br />I would not ship any weed to the USA. They seize a few envelopes then they have a handful of postcodes to work with. I think the USA treats weed like some kind of terrorist enabling drug. One bong and your dreaming of going whacked-out with guns and bombs and well no not really actually. Full stop and bee bop.<br /><br />This Farmers Market sounded like it was asking to be busted. LEA knows that the hidden internet is too big to police. Even Facebook has like a million teeny dealers on there bragging about selling a dime bag and so on. Skype, email, chat forums and bring and buy websites. You can see dealing going on in the local high street in some towns. Top cars in low towns driven by lucky men aged 19 upwards. You can see heroin addicts greet men in cars all over the UK. SR keeps the dealing away from families and kids and nervous older people. Cops can get on with maybe checking out the local shops and parks, kittens in trees to rescue and doughnuts t test out in case they are illegal.

				There have been some extremely great posts made this thread, and it should serve as a reminder for a variety of reasons. Be safe people, I think I can speak for the entire forum that we don&#039;t want to see anyone get busted for dumb shit. The way I see it, big or small time buyers or vendors we all have a target on our backs- the only way to be safe is to think about what you are doing, find a way to improve it, then repeat again. <br /><br />To open up the discussion further and play somewhat of a devils advocate a bit is anyone worried that the 420 sell could have negative implications? There is going to be a wave of new, inexperienced buyers throwing caution into the wind and waiting to make their first purchase- IMO I think they pose a massive liability to sellers. These will be the ones leaving packages laying out, not using encryption, checking DCN&#039;s through Tor, giving their address, facebook and who knows what else out with complete disregard because the thrill of it all will override common sense.&nbsp; The usps will be flooded with a shit ton of drugs all at one time; there will be seizures as unfortunately that&#039;s just part of the game. I know the sell is meant to be a celebration of sorts but I just don&#039;t like the smell of it. Am I alone here? <br /><br />We are all comrades one here in more ways that one. So please, even though the FM players in a way got themselves knocked by doing a bunch of careless dumb shit don&#039;t miss the message or advice that so many have offered here. Take it seriously.&nbsp; <br /><br />Peace.

				Computer programs are written by humans in a human readable form called &quot;source code&quot; then transformed (compiled) into a machine readable form called &quot;binaries&quot; by a compiler. Usually when you download a program you are grabbing the binary. But humans can&#039;t (easily) see into the inner workings of a binary so there&#039;s really no way to tell exactly what it does. So I choose to grab the source, go over it real quick and then compile the program myself.

Sign one that you don&#039;t know anything about Tor is the fact that you call it TOR instead of Tor, which means you probably learned about it from the media and not from academic papers. Doesn&#039;t mean your opinion is worthless, but it is a good indication that you are a noob. Second, Tor is open source software and anyone is free to check the source code. I stay in contact with multiple people who regularly follow Tor development and they would notice a backdoor if one was added. I doubt they all will cooperate. Tor has 15 developers and they live in a variety of different countries and audit each others code, compromising Arma will not be enough to compromise Tor in the way you say. Anyway if the code was added and then removed days later only the people and hidden services and relays that upgraded in that time window would have been compromised. Relays and hidden services in particular are usually some versions behind, but even users don&#039;t stay as up to date as they should.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=19287.msg197440#msg197440">Quote from: CaliTrees on April 19, 2012, 04:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">My intel led me to believe the FBI were setting up a large amount of TOR exit nodes and using correlation attacks.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t understand the preoccupation that noobs have with exit nodes. It is probably because they know that exit nodes can log traffic that exits the network. In reality I am far more concerned about entry guards, if Tor has an Achilles heel it is in the guard nodes not the exit nodes. To do correlation attacks against SR users LE will need to be able to monitor the entry guards of the clients connecting to it as well as silk road server itself (possibly via owning its entry guards), &quot;exit nodes&quot; have little to do with correlation attacks against hidden services and when it comes to Tor to the normal internet the entry guard is still the most vulnerable part not the exit (as far as correlation attacks go). <br /><br />FM fell because of a combination of using hushmail and insecure payment techniques. The&nbsp; most important security lesson for people on SR to learn is that you are as anonymous as your least anonymized network overlay. The Tor network overlay is a lot better than the paypal or mail systems (for receiving). The most important thing to do is start obtaining your bitcoins anonymously and cashing them out anonymously if you are not already, and understanding that Bitcoin is no better than Paypal unless you take steps to anonymize it yourself with your cash in and out technique, preferably using mixes in addition to this (using mixes by themselves is great for unlinkability but you will still risk money laundering charges).

				Seriously people, if LE had somehow cracked Tor, you really think they would spend 2 years going after some small time open drug forum? Please, they would be cracking down on the hardcore child porn sites before anything else. It LE honestly used that kind of info to take down nothing but TFM, then they are even more hopelessly incompetent than I could have dreamed. It&#039;s obvious how TFM was taken down.

Moneypak has never been safe, it&#039;s a centralized system that works with the cops to flag suspicious accounts. Any MP cashier needs to have unlimited SSN&#039;s because they&#039;re going to cut off cards sooner than later when you start withdrawing too much. MP was designed for online buying at Amazon.com and other sites, not to load out of state and cash out. Red flag.<br /><br />There has also been multiple media hype lately on how prepaid reloadable cards are being used by criminals to cash out. You can guarantee the DEA and IRS is going to start busting people using them. Don&#039;t have to worry with bitcoin, split it up into a hundred addresses and cash it out to cash in the mail anonymously, or in person. No cards, no banks, no IDs, no trail.<br /><br />Google &#039;Prepaid cards an emerging threat&#039; or &#039;Prepaid cards criminals&#039; and read all the recent news hype bullshit. That&#039;s always a good indicator what is to be the next target for law enforcement to spy on and start to make busts. Expect a huge prepaid card drug ring bust soon.<br />

				I would not buy bitcoins in any way that requires me to show a legitimate ID or otherwise seriously compromise my anonymity. Bitcoins are roughly as anonymous as the method used to obtain them, just keep that in mind at all times. The cash out is about as anonymous as the method used to cash them out. Mixes are really good for making it so the feds can&#039;t follow the money back to a vendor, but they will make you susceptible to money laundering charges, so my advice is to mix bitcoins and cash in and out in ways that don&#039;t require legitimate identification.

People should always be concerned where the threat to themselves lies. For vendors.. their threats are their own actions (which they can control) and some sort of system/admin failure that shuts down Silk Road. So their personal security habits IRL (i.e. their own responsibility, their own actions) are the paramount issue. Secondly... they should have a &quot;back-up plan&quot; in case SR should go down. I see three possibilities for them..<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Take biz completely offline, or only deal IRL if they have a IRL business they are running concurrently with their SR operations.<br />&nbsp; 2. Continue vending via secure email/tormail to loyal customers who retain their contact info and are willing to forgo escrow.<br />&nbsp; 3. Migrate to other vending sites with escrow (BMR) or move sales to other .onion sites of their own (like what Pot2Peer and Eradic have).<br /><br />&nbsp;For buyers... well again they should be concerned about their own actions but it is a vendor failure that should concern them. The vendor has their address (and possibly their real name). If the vendor lacked that bit of info buyers could only be threatened by a system/admin failure of SR proper. Logically then.. buyers should do what they can to minimize the connection between themselves and their mailing address, while still being able to collect their dope.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;1. The use of a mail drop, not a home address, is indicated. Mail drops and boxes are almost be definition not places you &quot;hang out&quot;. Hence you are only likely to be there at irregular intervals and the only paraphernalia or other dope present when you make pick up is whatever may be in the package being delivered.<br />&nbsp;2. The mail drop should be registered with a business name as part of the documentation on it. This prevents the vendor (who may be turned or blackmailed by the LE.. ) from giving them a real name. <br />&nbsp;With the use of these two steps the buyer can keep LE from immediately obtaining a warrant for their place of residence in the event of the LE playing hardball with a vendor.<br />&nbsp; By employing these two steps the wise buyer has effectively distanced himself from &quot;the low hanging fruit&quot; on the tree that a turncoat vendor could give up to the cops. They don&#039;t have a residence. They don&#039;t have a name. And at a cost of under $100 USD for a business class mail drop box. <br />&nbsp; Now .. the next step is to sanitize the paper trail between your public ID and your sleeping place/stash spot. When you get a mail drop (at least in the US) you have to present gov-issued photo-ID. If you live someplace that doesn&#039;t do this bully for you.. give them a fake name.&nbsp; If you want to be thoroughly secure obtain false ID. If you can do that ( I can&#039;t vouch for SR&#039;s ID vendors.. but I know a good risk when I see it) then you needn&#039;t follow the rest of the steps.<br />&nbsp;3. Change your license ID to something other than your place of actual residence. Similarly change the address of registration for any vehicles you may own and insure to addresses that are not where your bed, your bong, and your dope are kept.<br />&nbsp;Basically do your level best to make sure they have no way to burst in and scare you and find you redhanded with your dope.<br /><br />&nbsp;Oh and get a lawyer and put them on retainer. Do it before you buy another thing on S.R. Business maildrop and lawyer up. Do it right away.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />We&#039;ll see...hope we rock on for a while, but I got a feeling that when we fall, we&#039;ll fall hard.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;Proper preparation prevents piss poor performance.. and anxiety originating in such&quot; - Philter3&#039;s Dad.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				I think LE actually spend far far far far far more resources pwning CP traders than they do on internet drug traders, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that the internet drug trade is a relative drop in the bucket and the internet CP trade is pretty much 99.99% of the CP trade. They do spend *billions* of dollars to combat internet CP trading though, hardly a month passes without a major CP group (the CP equivalent of the farmers market) being busted. <br /><br />Also, essentially all of the organized trade groups (ie: not P2P traders) have core members who actually abuse children and share the photos with the rest of the members. In summary, most organized CP trading group members are just a bunch of sickos swapping files, but they rotate around cores that consist of child abusers.

The tools they justify for catching CP types are the same tools they will use to suppress dissent or bust people for dope.

It&#039;s certainly not acceptable to transfer the consequences of YOUR actions to ANOTHER person. You should be fully aware of the sentencing you may face PRIOR to breaking the law. And when the shit hits the fan, man up, and take responsibility for what you CHOSE to involve your self with in the first place. Snitching is like scamming. As in, when you have a transaction, the seller will not do business with you if they find out you want to take their money. Likewise, when you do a transaction, the seller will not do business with you if they find out you are willing to snitch on them. So instead of scamming them of their money, you are scamming them of their freedom. Your viewpoint is extremely immature, and were everyone to assume your viewpoint, then our community would become extremely vulnerable. Being known as an ex-convict for drug charges in the future will likely be much better than being known as someone who snitched on a fellow member of the drug community, which was oppressed by the global governmental control systems of the early 21st century.

				I have a personal code that I ever screw up and get arrested, I will not turn anyone in. I just wouldn&#039;t do it. Honestly, it probably wouldn&#039;t take that much off my sentence anyways. At times like that you need to man up and accept that the system just beat you. But don&#039;t empower the system by giving them more fodder. Look the cops right in the eyes and tell them that you&#039;re not helping them. Fight the system from the outside when you can, don&#039;t give into it to save your own skin.

				Anyone who thinks the cops are gonna give them a break if you &quot;help&quot;, are the worse kind of sucker. Trust, me you will not receive any reduction in your punishment by rolling over. If there is any wiggle room in your case, a good PAID attorney will exploit that for you. Do your fucking time and come out with the kind of respect that must be earned, the kind you can&#039;t counterfeit. Call it a retirement plan, or a tenured position at the firm, whatever works.<br /><br />

				Helping the cops is admitting guilt. They often lie to people and pretend they have more evidence than they actually do. By helping them you raise the chances of being locked up. This is why you never talk to cops and you get a lawyer.<br /><br />Helping cops is the same thing as talking to them. You&#039;re hurting yourself.

				This is in reply to all of you who replied to my last post in this thread...<br /><br />Bullshit. Thats what all the families of the sicillian mafia said who have been doing blood oaths with their family members for hundreds of years, and ya know what, they caved and snitched instead of going to prison. Snitced on their husbands, wives, kids, parents, aunts uncles, grandparents, and cousins. And it was FAMILY. None of us here are even family. So shut the fuck up. You might have that thought in your head NOW, but sitting in a Federal Prison Interrogation Room with Federal DEA and DOJ investigators and prosecutors WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND QUICK.

				Lots of people here admit that they will snitch :/ <br /><br />glad to know who to completely avoid doing any business with ever<br /><br />of course some in mafia snitch but just as many don&#039;t. Also the snitches get put into protective custody for the rest of their lives or they are brutally murdered.

				Using the mafia as an example period, is fail. I know that the media would have you believe these families are full of the hardest people on earth, but truth be told, most of them are born into tremendous privilege and about as hard as cotton candy. Like most people with wealth and influence that value that above anything they have. They never actually earned respect, and therefore do not value it or posses any of the genuine article. Not saying all of them, but many in these crime families are nothing more than rich kids living on the reputations their fathers earned. <br /><br />When you know the truth, which is snitching will not impact your sentence in the least, it&#039;s not even a temptation. In the event that you are connected at that level, and you have valuable knowledge like that, you&#039;d be wise to recognize that that hand is best left unplayed. You can roll over and save yourself a couple years at most, but forever lose the trust of the only people who can help you when the system is done with you. I&#039;d rather do shit the right way and even if I had to do a little more time, It would easier time because I could sleep well and my associates would be taking care of me. I&#039;m speaking hypothetically of course. Buying drugs from SR is the apex of my criminal mischief these days and I am certainly not affiliated with anyone the cops would be interested in. I&#039;m just sayin&#039;, <br /><br />It really isn&#039;t hard to make the right decision when you&#039;re not deluded.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				A non-stupid-fuck snitch facing long hard time will not even talk to cops. They negotiate with the prosecutors through their attorneys. Snitching pays if the benefit of the information the prosecutors can use is greater than what they get out of prosecuting you. Then theres the Witness Protection Program, new identities, new credit, new job, new house, new cars/trucks, new life... etc. Some are even paid handsomely for their snitching. I do not advocate snitching, but no one knows what they will do until they are arrested, in prison, and facing investigators, prosecutors, and decades of cold hard time. Fact remains, the majority snitches. The point I am driving home is to take precautions so its never an issue to begin with.
