				Copy/Pasted this from a few different wikipedia pages<br /><br /><br />Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly slicing the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine was the first active principle purified from a plant source and is one of at least 50 alkaloids of several different types present in opium, poppy straw concentrate, and other poppy derivatives. Morphine is generally 8 to 14 percent of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26 percent or produce little morphine at all (under 1 percent, perhaps down to 0.04 percent).<br /><br /><br />Black tar heroin is a type of illicit opiate narcotic drug formed from the incomplete acetylation of morphine. Black tar can contain a variable percentage of heroin, but despite the name, what makes Black Tar specific as a type is not actually its heroin (diacetylmorphine) content, but rather the greater mixture of lesser acetylated morphine derivatives—predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) and 3-MAM (3-monoacetylmorphine). This is caused by the use of the antiquated Wright-Beckett process (c. 1874), which produces a relatively crude and unrefined opiate product but does not require the complex lab equipment, high-purity acetylating chemicals or lengthy reflux steps necessary to produce pure heroin, making it attractive to clandestine drug producers.<br /><br /><br />Diacetylmorphine (Heroin) is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. Numerous mechanical and chemical means are used to purify the final product. The final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names. No.4 is the purest form — white powder (salt) to be easily dissolved and injected. No.3 is &quot;brown sugar&quot; for smoking (base). No.1 and No.2 are unprocessed raw heroin (salt or base).<br /><br /><br /><br />Check this picture out, shows the chemical routes from opium to heroin hcl -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Synthesis_of_Heroin_from_Opium.svg

				Why is there much more demand for heroin than morphine? isn&#039;t morphine more refined?

				morphine -&gt; diacetylmorphine (heroin) ~2.5x more potent by weight compared to morphine. High is the same as morphine just heroin goes faster through blood brain barrier and gives smoother and cleaner rush while morphine gives painful (pleasently) pins and needles.

				imo it is not the same. when i was an active opiate addict morphine was the last alternative, yes it has the opiate buzz but i did not like all the effects it had on me, for me was nowhere near h. i have heard the same from several people. i am so fortunate it has been several years for me, i will never go down that road again
