				I&#039;m chilling in tonight but tomorrow it&#039;s a C+C party which should be pretty good. The person who&#039;s hosting it is a mate and it normally turns into something comparable to a cross between Sodom, Gomorrah and the last days of Rome. GOOD TIMES! <br /><br />What about everyone else?

				Not sure yet. I rolled last night (Thursday) and I&#039;m getting 1/8 of shrooms. I might do that later but I have never really done shrooms before especially right after rolling. I didn&#039;t get jacked up though rolling just 125mg.

				C+C party is a Cocaine and Champagne party. You have to bring Bing and some bottles of bubbly as a requirement. They are pretty fun to be fair. :)

I&#039;m a bit of a Bing snob to be honest and I don&#039;t actually buy from anyone else off SR. I have been tempted to sample c63amg&#039;s product though because he has a 3-for-2 offer at the moment but if it&#039;s anything less than 80% pure then I will give it a miss. He also asks to FE for this offer but as a fellow vendor and a mod I don&#039;t expect to have to FE baring in mind I order from my own account to show faith. We shall have to see if he allows it.

I mentioned it on other threads but the people I work with and I actually have done the extraction for Bing from coca-tea and made 2-3oz batches several times. After acetone washing it we managed to get the product to 95% (lab tested) and you can tell it&#039;s that pure just from the fact the product couldn&#039;t dry properly because it absorbs moisture and remains tacky. Apart from that stuff Dutchaanbods is the best I&#039;ve had, no question about it.

His packaging is excellent, some of the stealthiest I have received. The packaging alone is one of the reasons why I like to buy from him so much, he takes his shit seriously. I mean, think of all the shit I have on my listings and I have no issue with buying from him or NL lol. :P

				Exactly because if SR had something to do with it would have been all over the news. As I say he was either cashing out like it was amateur night or he wasn&#039;t careful enough when collecting OR he was operating IRL and shit got out to 5-O. Simples.
