				So I&#039;m too poor to buy drugs at the moment and it&#039;s been raining a hell of a lot recently. I live near a field of cows and horses(separated paddocks) and plan on scoping it out for some shrooms. The cow paddock does have one bull so I&#039;m not overly keen on staying in the field too long, am looking for advice mainly on how not to spook these animals while I&#039;m looking through their shit or any advice in general! <br />also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmIsNpDimQ0

If there&#039;s ANY doubt in my mind that it may not be the the species I think it is, I simply don&#039;t pick it.<br /><br />Using this method I have two psychoactive species that I can easily identify and pick.<br /><br />So yeah, either be really fucking careful or just don&#039;t pick your own mushrooms.

				Yeah expected to get flamed lol, I&#039;ve read the guides but none of them mentioned much about anything to do with the animals them selves. I&#039;ve also read guides on mushroom picking specific to my region so I&#039;m a noob but not a complete fucking idiot anyone who doesn&#039;t have experience(me) and doesn&#039;t do ID requests deserves to get poisoned. Also not from US.

				Northern hemisphere? You are looking for semilancenata (spelling?) also often known as liberty caps. The mushies grow on the grass that has been fertilized by the dung, not on the dung itself... Dung growing magic mushrooms are tropical ones. To test if the mushroom is magic, pick it and bruise it (squish the end of the stem) and wait less than a minute and it should show signs of blueing. If it doesn&#039;t blue it isn&#039;t magic. You only need 1 dry gram (thats 10 grams wet) of this species of mushroom to trip hard and see visuals. Although they do grow best on fertilized ground, depending on the area, spores may have never arrived there to start growing. Magic mushrooms are most commonly found on university campus ground, or parks where lots of people&#039;s shoes have walked and trailed spores around. I also recommend you look for psilocibe cyanescens which grows off wood chips/mulch often found along pathways and gardens. <br />oh and as for the animals.. er.. cows. Most animals are afraid of humans and will leave you well enough alone. It doesn&#039;t take much to scare them away if they get too close for comfort. Try some loud noises/yelling/clapping and waving your arms around or holding your jacket up over your head to look bigger. As long as there is room in their fenced area to get away from you, they have will have no reason to charge you. As far as I know, cows aren&#039;t territorial and don&#039;t actually care about the color red &gt;_&gt;;

Yeah I&#039;m from Aus(FNQ, as tropical as it gets). I&#039;m gonna check the fields later tonight, I might have a search for cyanescens if tonight isn&#039;t fruitful. I feel re-assured knowing the cows aren&#039;t gonna be aggressive or something.<br />Thanks again for the information.

				I&#039;ve had fun looking for shrooms, to think such an amazing substance grows freely outdoors.<br />I have been informed of a great new spot where they grow in abundance. It will be nice for a change where other times i have only found between 6-10, or between 30-50, and 30-50 isnt much when your with a friend.<br /><br />If your unsure if its a magic shroom, you always pinch the stem, after a short while if its a magical shroom, the stem will turn blue.<br />Grab some pics of them so you know what to look for.<br /><br />Make sure you have a brown, or white paper bag, do not use plastic to put your shrooms in.<br />

				Not to change the subject but I have seen grow kits around that might be possible to get to you. Spores are probably a little tough for customs to identify. If they don&#039;t cost too much it might give you a decent into into what exactly you are looking for. Been thinking about picking a few up and setting up shop in the basement to see how it goes.
