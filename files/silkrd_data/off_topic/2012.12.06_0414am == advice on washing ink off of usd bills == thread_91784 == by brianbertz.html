				so yes i am seeking advice on washing the ink off of usd bills. 5 dollar bills to be more precise. i have succeeded with 2 of my last 3 tries but it is a supreme pain in the ass to get all of the ink off. all doesnt come off (at least not for me) but most did and when i printed a 20 on the paper it looks alright to the naked eye. good enough for night dealings or transactions in low light setting but 1. when i copy the 20 on my all in one printer the picture is darker and a bit less clear/detailed than a real one. im not expecting it to be perfect for a printer but is there any that print a good quality copy of a bill. 2. if someone has experiance in this let me know of an easier way or faster way then using purple power degreaser or whatever its called. i could be wrong but i didnt think you had to scrub the shit out of the bill for 10 to 20 mins. after soaking it in boiling degreaser for 10 mins. and advice would be welcomed. thanks. if its not allowed to talk about then i do apologize, just let me know and i will take it down. trying to make good fakes for those who want them on bmr. and just to see if i can make a good copy. peace

				im more into just seeing how high quality i can get it. i got the getting the ink down pretty good. it does come off but is a bitch. several soaks in the boiling &quot;solution&quot; and using a toothbrush. idk what the dpi of the printer was that i used but i would have thought that it should have been fairly decent being it was a photosmart. but then i see my quality and i see the quality of the print from the undercover video on youtube where this guy shows the police how to do it. his looks flawless. serials dont look disscolored or blurry and the picture quality looks great.... and his printer looks like a shitty 40 dollar printer lol he didnt use photoshop and i dont know how to even work a program like that so for now im just copying bill and sending blank bill through the printer. so a high dpi printer.... any more precise reccomendations from anybody on what exact printer? at the most i would use this money as drug money. would never pass a bill at a store even if it was perfect. there is coupons for that ;)
