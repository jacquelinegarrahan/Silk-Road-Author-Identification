				And Limitless likes you, or at very least, the bot was designed to like you. The bot doesn&#039;t quite know how to handle criticism, sarcasm overloads the output of the algorithm, but the auto deny being wrong wrong functionality is probably some of the best written code that has come out of Law enforcement in years. He isn&#039;t on holiday, he is being updated to a dual processor multithreading decision making engine, because there were some out of logis posts that stood out weeks ago, and it had to be fixed before it was widespread knowledge.<br /><br />I kid of course his bot isn&#039;t up for upgrade until the revenue bill is passed in the UK, but since it is a classified program, they might have to continue funding the effort by the bot continuing to sell grey area chaems and all the confiscated pre ban this and that usually on his vendor page.

				http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/fa89fcfcd2<br />&#039;UPDATE: Now officially off duty until I return which will be the first week of September. Leaving my account open so if you want to make an order for me to deal with as soon as I get back feel free and it&#039;ll be dealt with the day after I come back.<br /><br />Have fun everyone, I know I will. ;)&#039;<br /><br /><br />Limitless is a cokebot its confirmed. The makers of Futurama was so inspired by the vendor bot , that they decided to put a bender bot in there program.

				Thanks midland. I was expecting him to have more hardcore substances on sale haha. Anyways this hardly looks like a scam attempt. All these posts are most likely just going to help his business positively when he returns.
