				Just discovered 2 orders that are still processing, for several hundred dollar bulk buys, were addressed to none deliverable addresses. One was a fucking national forest in Colorado.<br /><br />What a great way to kill a new vendor. Order huge amounts from multiple accounts. When the resolution center comes up, whos support going to side with? Not the vendor who has had several none deliverable orders recently pop up in resolution; seller must be doing something wrong so award the buyer. So I would have been out $1000 from just these two orders I have caught. When they &quot;return to sender&quot; that MDMA it&#039;s not coming back to me<br /><br />I have 60+ orders needing to go out ASAP. Now I have to screen every single fucking address. It&#039;s not just making sure they are real addresses, because I just caught one that was a real address, to the towns city police station. <br /><br />Simple fix? Make new accounts FE. Surely they won&#039;t spend money knowing they won&#039;t get it back.<br /><br />Wrong. I just checked several of the packages ready to be dropped off. A fucking Mormon church? God damn it. Best part? They have not left a score, so I&#039;m sure rather or not those crazy Mormons get the drugs, it will be a 1 of 5. Check another package, great, not an actual place.<br /><br />If you ordered from me, might be a slight delay. Hopefully you can understand why. <br /><br />yay for a &quot;free market&quot; which encourages this type of bullshit. I seriously doubt support is willing/ is able to do anything about this.

				I dunno why you are being handed such a shit sandwich. I ordered from you, was delighted with my product(s) as received. Not only did the wife and I roll our nuts off, but I also shared with two of my soul brothers in RL. Your product rocks, your customer service is the bomb, why people gotta shit up a good thing? I hope you get some good customers, that treat a good vendor with good product the way you deserve. <br /><br />In my not so mumbled opine, scammers, pedophiles, thieves and liars, all deserve to be ass raped by a Sandusky, then chopped up and fed to other violators of the covenants. AND not the covenants as defined by LE, either. YOU DO TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN, the 11th commandment.

				Has the buyers disputed delivery of the items? I&#039;ve had some pretty shady addresses before that I sent to (like a spot in a road with not a building anywhere nearby) and they still got delivered. For all I know the mailman who delivers that route is the one who placed the order.

				the answer is yes <br />i just had the exact same thing happen,except i made him finalize as he was suppose to prior to shipment,then he dicked me around and said as soon as i give tracker, then more dick he said when it crosses customs, RED FLAGS ALL OVER ,then he said i have a friend in customs ?then the tracker said undeliverable to address. more dick, he claimed i messed up the zip code, when i asked for the 8 digit and he did not get back to me prior to sending express .<br />he finally&nbsp; finalized,but tracker says it is at his postal station that he gave address to, ends there. now he went back and gave 1/5months later. <br />sso even if they fe or finalize they can gobacxk to all your old orders with them and change feedback,trust m i know.

				I thought vendors checked every address anyway before shipping orders, in case of this sort of thing, or in case of the address turning up no obvious building? It&#039;s all risk management.<br /><br />Still, at first I couldn&#039;t believe people would do what you&#039;re describing - but competition is serious, so I&#039;m not all that surprised.<br /><br />Check everything all the time if you want to stay in the game, I guess.

				Same thing happened to me ... you have to be careful who you let purchase from you. <br /><br />Had a staggering number of smaller orders go &quot;missing&quot; before I changed my terms. 100g and above orders never had a problem, go figure.<br /><br />Must be a competitor ... no other reason to send the packs to the middle of nowhere.

Every new customer is first&nbsp; looked at with Google maps.<br />To see if it is legit, not some PObox, an abandoned building, no house at all...yes that too etc.<br />Yes, of course you check, what did you expect... ship to some scammer without know anything.<br />For me...no problem, everybody is checked. When it looks ok the order is shipped, all info is destroyed completely after shipping ....<br />You have to be careful anyway, when you have a new customer how can you sell him a large quantity of goods.<br />You could even -when you want to be nice- is do a custom listing. One part escrow, other part FE.<br />Not so nice just FE.<br />All depends on your status and how &#039;&#039;trustworthy you are as a vendor.<br />Here the rule...nothing goes out when not payed! escrow or FE...when you&#039;re new only FE. Not interested find another vendor.<br />And still need to see Google when you&#039;re new !

				Hmm I wonder how many vendors actually do use google maps or the equivalent to map out their buyers.&nbsp; Waiting for someone to order from a nice vacation house so they can call in a favor if they&#039;re ever in the area.. lol&nbsp; I can just see my roommate/flatmate saying &quot;uhhh there&#039;s some people at the door that wanna know if they can crash here in exchange for some shrooms&quot;<br /><br />Good luck getting it sorted out.&nbsp; It&#039;s always nice to see the vendor&#039;s side rather than all the &quot;I ordered 72 whole hours ago and still have nothing!&quot; posts.
