				I ran across a post on The Intel Exchange that peaked my interest about the Denver International Airport.&nbsp; The whole place seems very mysterious....<br />I then did some digging and found this clearnet forum and found some pretty in depth information on the subject. <br /><br />To me it seems entirely feasible that there is something under the airport that the powers that be don&#039;t want us to know about.&nbsp; The whole thing about the freemasons being involved and the fact that the main concourse is called &quot;The Great Hall&quot; are very suspicious to me.<br /><br />What do you guys who live in CO or near Denver think about this? <br /><br />*** Clearnet*** http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1218

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Part One - The Airport<br /><br />The airport was built in 1995 on 34,000 acres (53 square miles; 137.593 Sq. km) in spite of the fact that Denver already had what everyone said was a perfectly fine airport - Stapleton - which was ordered closed when DIA was built so there &quot;wouldn’t be any competition&quot;. In fact the new airport has less gates and less runways than Stapleton did (I hope you’re saying, &quot;That makes no sense&quot;...). All it does have is a lot more acreage. More acreage than an airport that size could possibly need. Most which sits unused. They say it’s in case they need to do any future expansion. DIA is the 7th busiest airport in the US according to a 2002 Crain’s Chicago Business report.<br /><br />The initial cost of this New Beast was to be 1.7 billion dollars (with a &quot;B&quot;) but by the time they were done playing games, having problems, getting bailed out and got extra government money (and money from private corporations on top of that), it cost about $4.8 billion - obscenely over budget. I have yet to meet a local who wanted the thing built, or didn’t have a frothing, rabid story about the whole mess. Words used to describe the DIA were &quot;buried in technical problems&quot;, &quot;poor project management&quot;, &quot;overwhelming complexity&quot; and &quot;America’s most inconvenient airport&quot;. It was built in a high wind area (Stapleton hadn’t been) that causes it to be shut down or flights delayed often. The extensive automated baggage system so was messed up, such a circus of errors that it was worse than unusable - it was an industry joke. But it had to be built, and built there. Some say the reason that this was built and there was no stopping it, no cost spared to do so and why it was so SO over budget and took so many years is because it’s really an underground military base and a civilian detainment camp.<br /><br />Some interesting facts:<br /><br />*<br /><br />Even though the area is basically flat (with a stunning view of mountains all around, since it’s in a valley), the expense and time was taken to extensively lower some areas and raise others. They moved 110 million cubic yards of earth around. This is about 1/3rd of the amount of earth they moved when they dug out the Panama Canal.<br />*<br /><br />The airport has a fiber optic communications core made of 5,300 miles of cable. That’s longer than the Nile River. That’s from New York City to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The airport also has 11,365 miles of copper cable communications network.<br />*<br /><br />The fueling system can pump 1,000 gallons of jet fuel per minute through a 28-mile network of pipes. There are six fuel hold tanks that each hold 2.73 million gallons of jet fuel. This is somewhere in the &quot;no one will ever ever need this much&quot; range.<br />*<br /><br />Granite was imported from all over the world - Asia, Africa, Europe, North and South America - and used in making the main terminal floor. This is a ridiculous expense, especially when you’re already over budget. They say, &quot;The floor pattern echoes the roof design and subtly reinforces passenger flows&quot;. Ah... subliminal messages to move your ass. It might look pretty but would any of us know Chilean granite from Chinese granite? Or care? You can dye rock if it’s colors you’re after. Cheaper rocks. (I wonder what the &quot;stones have power&quot; people say about this...)<br />*<br /><br />The huge, main terminal is Jeppesen Terminal, named after Elfrey Jeppesen, who was the first person to create maps specifically for aviation (the company is still in business today). This area is known as the &quot;Great Hall&quot;; it’s said this is what the Masons name their meeting place.<br />*<br /><br />It is 900 feet by 210 feet big. This is over 1.5 million square feet of space. All told, there is over 6 million square feet of public space at DIA. The airport brags that they have room to build another terminal and two more concourses and could serve 100 million passengers a year. The airport flew 36 million in 2001.<br />*<br /><br />The only way to get to the other two concourses/terminals from the Great Hall, or vice versa, is via the airport’s train system.<br />*<br /><br />There are more than 19 miles (30 km) of conveyor belt track, luggage transport cars and road in their own underground tunnels that move baggage and goods. They’re so huge you can drive trucks through them, and some remain unused.<br />*<br /><br />The entire roof of DIA is made of 15 acres of Teflon-coated, woven fiber glass. The same material is on the inside as a layer, also. The place looks like a bizarre (but kind of cool) scene out of &quot;Dune&quot;, comprised of huge, spiked tent-like structures. The material reflects 90% of the sunlight and doesn’t conduct heat. So you can’t see into the place with radar or see heat signatures. I added helpfully.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I&#039;ve heard there&#039;s a lot of masons in Denver, can anyone confirm this?<br /><br />It&#039;s an interesting read. I fly in here regularly and it does take an awful long time to get the shuttle outside of the airport, you&#039;re literally driving for 15 solid minutes through solar panels before you reach the highway.

				Is this the place with the alleged creepy ass pictures and what not? I think there was something about dead babies and/or a disturbing gas /chemical warfare scene. I know you said the murals were painted over. Is this what I&#039;m talking about? Haha sorry last time I heard about it was quite a while ago.

				Yes, the murals are very disturbing, especially to be placed in an airport.<br /><br />This site has alot more clear and concise info on the subject,&nbsp; including pictures of the murals.&nbsp; The first site I posted is just an forum with a bunch of like-minded people thinking about and discussing the DIA.<br />***Clearnet***&nbsp; http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-the-denver-international-airport/

				Thanks for the links. It&#039;s too much for me though. I literally laughed out loud at some of the things. There are a few strange things though.

				Yeah, some of it is really far fetched.&nbsp; Even if there is no conspiracy going on, the murals coupled with the 32 foot blue mustang with glowing red eyes that greets you as you arrive at the airport, make the airport seem rather eerie.&nbsp; Also, why build a runway only to cover it with 4&quot; of dirt?&nbsp; Why not just leave it uncovered and use it sporadically rather than not at all?&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t have the answers to all of these questions and no one is going to be able to produce cold hard facts about this stuff so I doubt I will ever know.&nbsp; Its like the NSA scandal that just came out, we the people will never know the full extent of the surveillance that is going on because the people who are in power will not allow that information to get out.&nbsp;
