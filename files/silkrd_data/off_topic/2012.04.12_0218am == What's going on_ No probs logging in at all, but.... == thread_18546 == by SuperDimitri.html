				I haven&#039;t experienced any outages, recently, but both recent orders have been in &#039;processing&#039; for 24 hours, now,and there is a new option that says &#039;auto finalize&#039; that I don&#039;t recall, although it is &#039;N/A&#039;. <br />One of the vendors has always processed within 2 hours, so 24 is a bit of a time, and I haven&#039;t heard back from them, and they already get inundated with PMs, so I was just wondering if anyone knew if anything was up? Other than some claimed outages. <br />thanks

				Still nothing. I notice many others&#039; are not having issues. Now I wonder if there was some sort of hiccup in the order, and they didn&#039;t receive them? <br />36 hours without any action is not the norm for these 2 vendors. <br /><br />OK, one just answered my PM, but still hasn&#039;t processed it. <br />Just not used to waiting so long for an item to ship................................ :(

				Yeah, I think it&#039;s a new column. Used to say it would AF when you hovered over the finalize option. <br />I was just getting impatient as I get spoiled with such promptness on normal occasion. <br />1 got back but still hasn&#039;t processed, other has now gone in transit, so feeling a bit better. <br />Just seemed maybe somehow they got under the radar, but all seems good, now.
