				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;m helping a buddy obtain a fake ID (CT, US) and wanted to know how far from the subject and at what height the camera should be to get the most legitimate looking picture. They&#039;re just going to use the ID to get into bars and buy alcohol, so it doesn&#039;t need to be perfect... But why do it half assed when it can be done right?<br /><br />Anyone know what the DMV&#039;s setup is? Or have any experience with fake identification? Any assistance, tips would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!

				Thanks for the response...<br /><br />Like I said, it&#039;s for a friend, and I&#039;m sure they&#039;d prefer not to have to go to Walmart for the picture, for convenience&#039;s sake if nothing else.

				Deleted my thread after I saw this one.<br /><br />I was thinking about buying a fake ID online for the purpose of buying a gun in another state through a private sale, my plan is just to set up what would normally be a legal deal and drive over and make&nbsp; a purchase. I live in the US, but my city/state has very strict gun laws, and it&#039;s pretty much impossible for me to get a gun legally since I&#039;m on deferred disposition&nbsp; after getting caught with marijuana.&nbsp; Anyway, I want some input on where I should look for a good quality ID that isn&#039;t absurdly expensive (thinking $200 as my budget). I found this site http://www.idchief.ph/ but they don&#039;t have the state I&#039;m looking for (NH, I could settle for Maine) and I can&#039;t be sure if they&#039;re legit.<br /><br />I&#039;d just really like some info from someone who has bought a fake or knows someone who has.<br /><br />Thanks.

				idchief is legit, if it&#039;s the real site (they change domains all the time) <br /><br />you just go somewhere that does passport photos and also get the scans. then you load up an image manipulator and change the area between your eyes and other subtle features so you don&#039;t show up in a facial recog search. <br /><br />just go to arizona and look in the classifieds and craigslist for gun sales. meet some guy anywhere and trade normally don&#039;t even need ID<br />
