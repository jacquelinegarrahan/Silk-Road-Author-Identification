				Dan I love it!!!!&nbsp; I&#039;m a coffee fanatic.&nbsp; I drive two hours away to get my coffee beans because they are so amazing.&nbsp; Blue mountain coffee has a Kona Dream flavor which when ground just right and put into a french press is probably the most orgasmic cup of coffee I&#039;ve ever had.&nbsp; I drink it black with a few good shakes of cinnamon.&nbsp; It&#039;s so good i should offer it on SR lol.&nbsp; I guarantee a live angel choir with every sip.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I prefer a dark roast with lots of powdered creamer and two splenda. It&#039;s more about inducing a good healthy poop than it is a morning pick me up. Two cups of coffee ---&gt; poop ---&gt; two portions of snus. Once my nicotine withdrawal is taken care of my day has peaked, and it&#039;s all downhill from there. :(

				+1 to wine glass Shapes :D I&#039;ve got a question as well, is it unhygienic to not &quot;properly&quot; wash my mug until there are tea stains(circle rings left when I don&#039;t take a sip for a while) pretty much at all levels of the cup? I just rinse it a whole bunch of times after each use, until it starts to even look too bad for me.

				No coffee at night guys and gals??<br /><br />Ah well, me either..drinking water here. <br /><br />If anyone else feels so inclined Bruce has asked if anyone else would verify that I am purplepanth (moron who locked self out of forum account) from chatting on the forum, then I will indeed remain the winner. Either way I got the thrill of winning even if I don&#039;t end up winning..lol<br /><br />Anyhow back to coffee chat, has anyone else tried the Baileys non alcoholic irish cream creamers?

				No coffee after 5 for me.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t always happen but I try to stick to that rule.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;ll just be staring the ceiling exhausted lying in bed.&nbsp; The movie &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot; comes to mind about this tho.&nbsp; The scene with one of the Wu-tang clan was talking how he likes getting caffeinated before he falls asleep because his dreams are &quot;faster&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how that works but I know a couple others that are like this.&nbsp; Lucky bastards.&nbsp; Maybe if I cut the nicotine out it would be possible?&nbsp; Fuck I don&#039;t wanna find out.<br /><br />The non alcoholic baileys sounds like a nightmare as well.&nbsp; I really like the real stuff in my coffee if it&#039;s that kinda night, but if it was the other it would just be foreplay without the happy ending.&nbsp; I just can&#039;t do anything sweet in my mug.&nbsp; Makes me cringe when I see someone dump +4 sugar packets in a tiny cup. <br /><br />Looks like things worked out with bruce?&nbsp; My only evidence I can really point to is in this thread.&nbsp; Don&#039;t know what else can be done.&nbsp; <br /><br />ooooooh... night all!&nbsp; rest easy.&nbsp;

				Hello all! Good morning!<br /><br />Not so much, got a freaking head cold..started yesterday. Everyone in the house has it, which makes it a crabby not fun place to be.. <br />:(<br /><br />Believe it or not, I am not big on taking anything, so I just put up with it and use vicks to breath at night. Just hope I feel normal again soon, hate feeling anything but normal. Well suboxone normal, but normal for me, damn it.<br /><br />Anyhow sip sip puff puff...oh and I always have thought when you have a cold would be the best time to quit smoking, I at least cut way the hell back when I am sick.

				I have some new coffee on the way that I&#039;m going to be trying out. Looking forward to it.<br /><br />Also, I don&#039;t think there are too many combinations that taste better than coffee and vanilla icecream. They were made for each other :P

				Oh.. my.. goodness.........<br /><br />So I&#039;ve come back with an amazing trip report. <br /><br />I woke up around 8am on Saturday morning. I was still a bit tired from the day before from working a hard day&#039;s shift at the Cheese Sandwich Factory making cheese sandwiches for all the good little boys and girls so I was in need of a STRONG pick me up and my bullet had run dry weeks ago. So I made sure I had one of my favorite strains of weed rolled up nice and tight in it&#039;s zig-zag home. I almost felt bad burning it&#039;s home to the ground and inhaling it into my lungs but I managed to press forward. I sparked the tip of it&#039;s very precious and flammable roof with the flicker from my bic and before anyone knew what had happened. I then walked to my kitchen were you would swear Jesus himself had come down and help me make this cup of coffee. I ground up some fresh beans and turned on the coffee pot. The smell of a classic medium roast fills the room. The rich, pure taste is important to the growers of these beans. That&#039;s why they specially roast each bean at the right temperature to release rich flavors and aromas. At this point I&#039;m almost getting a semi for the coffee. I put the beans in the coffee pot and like usher says I let it burn..... sort of.... gets hot.... but not really burns... but anyway the moment of truth was approaching so I ran downstairs to the ice cream man&#039;s basement where all 347 flavors of ice cream are stored and I go for the plain vanilla. I then run back upstairs where my first cup is there waiting for me. The moment of truth has come upon me. I go and get an icecream scooper from my drawer next to my refrigerator and commence in taking one very, very hefty scoop of icecream. The icecream has now been put in the coffee and it&#039;s finally time to give this a try. So I pick the cup up and put it to my mouth. I take a sip. And........... it&#039;s pretty good.&nbsp; ;D

				I am a sucker for a mind-blowing cup of coffee.<br /><br />My favs include anything that Dillanos makes - they have some strong blends...and I tend to favor the espresso roasts.&nbsp; I swear their coffee actually tastes like it smells.&nbsp; Unreal.<br /><br />Also, Vietnamese iced coffee made with sweetened condensed milk is AMAZING.&nbsp; If you have never tried it, you have never really lived.

				Happy Friday morning coffee time, my fellow caffeine lovers.<br /><br />I think i&#039;ll head to my local cafe and enjoy a coffee....double shot low fat caffe latte.<br /><br />Impress your barista and fellow coffee dwellers around you and say-&quot;Caffe Latte when you order instead of just &quot;Latte.&quot;<br /><br />If you were in Italy, and said &quot;latte&quot; you would be served a cup of milk.<br /><br />So say it properly....and say it proud....now everyone repeat after me....&quot;Caffe Latte&quot;......excellent, and again? &quot;Caffe Latte!&quot;<br /><br />NOW I&#039;M FEELING IT! ONE MORE FUCKING TIME! <br /><br />&quot;CAFFE LATTE!&quot; YES! YES! <br /><br />Now, i&#039;m Italian...so i always say Caffe Latte, its just the correct pronunciation.<br /><br />Hearing just latte just shows how lazy we can be with our speech. Anyway i do hope i have managed to convert some of you...so next time your there about to place your coffee order, stand out from the crowd.....be proud....and say it loud!<br /><br />1 Caffe Latte....yada yada yada.....kapish? If you say it with a very slight italian accent, watch people turn their heads, he he....oh, i&#039;m off to get coffee...have a great day everyone. : )

I&#039;ve only seen the wax for sale in US and Canada, when they call it earwax it puts me off lol :) Is it concentrate too hun?<br /><br />Hi all, having a tea break from the cleaning, need to take dogs out too!

				Morning. I got pretty lit last night per my usual routine. Took day off. Decided to be productive and clean garage. Good.for me, right?<br /><br />Anyways, there appears to be a gangster possum(I know that&#039;s not how you spell it) in there and he/she does not give a shit. No problem, he wants that turf, he/she can have it. I come inside for a minute, go back out and WTF? NOW THERE&#039;S A SKUNK IN THERE TOO!&nbsp; I am not running an animal sanctuary. I put a cat door in so the stray cats have a place for the winter...not skunks/opposums. They appear to be juveniles and friends. Any advice? They need to go.<br />

				Just got off the phone with animal control. Their suggestion is to trap them, put trap in a garbage can, fill garbage can with water. I&#039;d rather put miss animal control in a garbage can. Evil fembot.<br /><br />I poked the possum with the handle of my shovel. It just grunts at me. Now with the skunk there, I don&#039;t dare try that again. That little bastard just hopped right at me!&nbsp; HOPPED!&nbsp; With its little jacked up tail! Gonna try the food thing. Will update<br />

				@Mary I&#039;m not sure if it was a concentrate I got it from TGOD it was the crumble wax.<br /><br />@Chevelle I definitely wouldn&#039;t be poking it with anything, all you need is the skunk to get mad and spray your garage up. The smell will last a very, very long time. I would try the food method. Kind of a funny problem to have ;D

				@Mary I&#039;m the same as you everytime I&#039;m with my friends it&#039;s always my weed being smoked. I only sell to people that I&#039;ve personally known for a long time, though. No new faces, one of the guidelines I try to follow ;D So pretty much every single person I smoke with I also sell weed to. I would kind of feel like a dick if I was smoking the weed I was selling to people ??? at least that&#039;s how I feel. So I don&#039;t mind always smoking my weed. In fact, I encourage it ;D

				Update on the skunk and possum situation.Well I ended up taking animal controls recommendation and killed those fucks....just kidding. Jeff(skunk) and Leroy(possom) have found a new home in my garage.<br /><br />After taking the recommendation to feed them..Doh!...they seem to really like me. I&#039;m not too fond of Leroy, due to his incredible ugliness and never ending grunting. But Jeffis about the cutess thing ever. I went outside yesterday with my cat and here comes Jeff! Hop hop hop! So my cat runs up to it and I&#039;m screaming No! No! No! And the skunk just goes ninja hopping in circles around my cat! I&#039;m sure I&#039;m in for a day of cat baths, but no...they start playing in the back yard. Taking turns chasing each other!<br /><br />Anyways...who am I to judge? I figure let them be. I didn&#039;t really feel like cleaning out the garage anyways. Also I guess its not uncommon for possums and skunks to bed together. Learned something new. And they love cat food...so its all good.

Beefsteaks can get pretty good sized. 6-7 Inches in diameter. How gay is that? :) , then we laughed and smoked a primo sr bowl, which is funny too cause I notice people ask me where I get my shit.

I do see the practical applications of growing poisonous plants, they do have a certain beauty about them. Probably why I love begonias so much though Nightshade is considered more poisonous.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;Cocaine is the way to wake up, if you don&#039;t mind the mid-morning come-down.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Most of the time I&#039;ve done it, I had already been doing it all night, so I&#039;m not sure if<br />that really counts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many night runs, I was the midnight rider, and I had a flawless<br />record, I do owe much of that to cocaine.&nbsp; <br />The Buprenorphine kills the cocaine euphoria for me, I even tried smoking rocks with one of<br />my heavy-hitters, took 4 big cloud-hits, didn&#039;t float my boat, could have been shit coke, <br />but I&#039;ve noticed that if I were to take methadone or anything but bupe, I would have a normal experience, perhaps some of cocaine&#039;s action is upon the kappa opioid receptor? that would explain<br />why more methadone patients have trouble with cocaine, it lacks kappa activity.&nbsp; There is also<br />a difference in individual response to kappa activation, especially between males/females,<br />this has been documented.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ahh.. I used to hate the buprenorphine taste, especially<br />suboxone, but I couldn&#039;t stop myself from snorting the subutex, so I had to go orange.&nbsp; <br />Now, I don&#039;t love it, but I&#039;m thankful for it, its like chewing on a bag of heroin!<br />&nbsp;I am going to go have a ciggie soon,<br />gotta quit, I figure I can spend 3x as much on psychedelics and MDMA if I quit.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />damn nanny-state motherfuckers taxing my sweet deathsticks.&nbsp; Back when I was a kid, <br />we would have cigarette fights when we were tripping on acid, just throw a handfull<br />of squares at someone! sweet baby jesus, I miss those days.&nbsp; <br />Looking forward to an LSD-soaked weekend, and communing with my<br />spirit guide.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here&#039;s to the finer things in life!

				Thanks for the words of encouragement. It is indeed the best thing I can do for myself. If I dont quit my two pack a day habit now, which costs $20 freakin dollars a day!, I will surely end up in the hospital hooked up to an Oxygen machine and I just dont want that. I truly believe that weed has somehow protected me all these years from my awful nicotine habit. Nothing I can prove but either that or just dumb luck that I have been able to smoke for 15 years with little to no consequence. Shits catching up with me. <br /><br />Anyhow, here&#039;s to a fresh start for my black lungs.

It is indeed the best thing I can do for myself. If I dont quit my two pack a day habit now, which costs $20 freakin dollars a day!, I will surely end up in the hospital hooked up to an Oxygen machine and I just dont want that. I truly believe that weed has somehow protected me all these years from my awful nicotine habit. Nothing I can prove but either that or just dumb luck that I have been able to smoke for 15 years with little to no consequence. Shits catching up with me. <br /><br />Anyhow, here&#039;s to a fresh start for my black lungs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can totally relate brother. I quit smoking manufactured ciggs back in the 90&#039;s. I only make my own smokes now. And with pipe tobacco type cuts being taxed less they are selling cigg tobacco as pipe. It&#039;s much cheaper and cleaner to smoke. I don&#039;t want to enable you to get sick I&#039;m just telling you why my lungs don&#039;t hurt, unless its from too much hash. ;)<br /><br />Morning everybody! *Smacks a spammer and sits at the table with his cup o&#039; joe*

				I&#039;ve heard if you take half of one of those nicotine patches and put it on right before you go to sleep you have some crazy dreams. The nicotine supposedly wakes up parts of your brain that should normally be dormant while you sleep and kicks your dreams into overdrive. I have never tried this, has anyone else?

				Normally the 300mg of caffeine preworkout I take before hitting the gym in the morning is a good start to the day. Gives you the jitters and the odd heart Palpitation.
