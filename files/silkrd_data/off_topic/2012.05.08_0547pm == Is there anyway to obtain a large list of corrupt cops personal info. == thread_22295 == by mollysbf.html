				I was just wondering if there was anywhere on the darkweb or clearnet that provides such a list. Things like addresses and phone numbers. It doesn&#039;t have to be a database of just the corrupt ones because I could weed those out on my own probably. I HAVE NO INTENT on doing anything illegal with this list I was just wondering if something existed though.

				Not sure what your expecting from Tor but whena cop goes corrupt he doesnt just go and put it onto here, the only way your going to find it is to try going through messages/chatrooms etc that are a bit deeper.

				I am just talking about some kind of public record/ list of all the cops addresses. Just like how cops can look up my address whenever they want if they new my name I would like to be able to do that with an officer or city official. I am not trying to chat with a corrupt cop or get some super secret list of corrupt cops or whatever your thinking. Know what I am saying?

				whosarat.com might find you a list of agents and LE addresses, I have heard about it a few times but never decided to spend any money for membership , it really pissed the government off though so it probably isn&#039;t entirely worthless<br /><br />Pretty much people get busted and then give over all court documents and info on the informants / undercovers , and then they screen it to try and make sure it is legit info on informants/agents, and then they sell it for a membership fee. If you end up getting a membership you should try and copy the entire site and post an open source copy ;).
