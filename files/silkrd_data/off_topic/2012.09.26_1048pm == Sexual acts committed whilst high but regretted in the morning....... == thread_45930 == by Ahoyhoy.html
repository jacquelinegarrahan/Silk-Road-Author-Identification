				On a less amusing note...<br /><br />Besides alcohol-related incidents years ago, recently my ladyfriend decided to randomly stop by an hour after I had eaten some shrooms. After getting undressed and starting to go, the shrooms hit me and I couldn&#039;t focus, so I went outside and walked around for an hour or two until I calmed down. I went back inside and said I felt sick and had a headache, so it just wasn&#039;t a good night to do anything. I never told her what was up, since she&#039;s fairly anti-drug.<br /><br />That caused a special kind of regret. Not an &quot;aw shiiit, did I really do that? lol&quot; but an &quot;I just made my girlfriend of a couple years feel like shit and I will never be able to apologize and say what happened.&quot;

				A mate of mine was shagging his GF whilst both were high on E.

				&nbsp; One Autumn night, a female ex-gf of mine called me up to smoke some hash and party, maybe do a few Ambien.&nbsp; So she comes over, we are going about our thing, watching pornography and smoking, when she asks to use the bathroom.&nbsp; &nbsp;I few minutes pass, and I wonder if she is doing Heroin, as I do not use H anymore, as we were both recovering addicts.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was then, that I heard the loud &quot;Crash! bang! flop!&quot; I go into the bathroom and find her on the floor, eyes open, staring at the ceiling, blood running down an arm with a needle hanging out.&nbsp; I asked her why she did it, she replied &quot;It&#039;s like ketamine, you totally don&#039;t know what&#039;s what!&quot; so begins a wonderful night of debauchery, IV Ambien use, butyl nitrite, and hashish.&nbsp; &nbsp;So we screw/shoot/fall down all night,&nbsp; probably did 100mg of Ambs each(I do not recommend this) and I&#039;m driving her home, when she says &quot;lets pull over and fuck.&quot;&nbsp; So I pull the car over, we start fucking in a pull-off near a farm on a dirt road, in my vehicle.&nbsp; She says &quot;Stick it in my ass&quot; which was beyond my capabilities at the time, when a morning Jogger came running by, it was morning, quite light out, and I felt ashamed and degraded.&nbsp; This is not really a regret, just a memory to remind me that everything has its own place and time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope you enjoyed it, I like to share when I can.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do anything I mentioned, except for the sex part. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I vaguely remember this one night after inviting this girl from class over to my dorm room. I was hoping to get it in before the whole football team did. We blew some etizolam, did a few shots, and she vaped some bud and 5-Meo-Dalt with me. She decided that we should attempt to have sex. I just remember laughing at her the whole time we fucked. All I remember is just laughing at her like she was some ugly fat bitch and I was winning a really bad bet my roommate put me up to. I ended up waking up after it was all over, going to class and she wouldn&#039;t speak to me after that. I still have no idea what happened besides an immense amount of laughing and her not being there when I woke up the next day.

				Here goes...<br /><br />It was a house get-together, just some friends having a few drinks and maybe smoking a blunt or two in rotation, when a new group arrived. They had barely said hi to everyone when they started popping ROLLS! Me and my best friend (I am a guy, she is a girl) had agreed that we would not smoke weed or do any drugs that night but now there were 5-6 people about to start rolling! So we entertained them for a while, blew them up and such until there was only one of them left with me and my best friend. And we wanted to roll. So me and my best friend start hitting up everyone we know that might be able to sell us some rolls (mind you, we&#039;re pretty much drunk and it&#039;s maybe 1-2 in the morning). She finally finds someone that says he has some &quot;trippy stuff that&#039;s like a roll.&quot; If I had been sober, I would have said hell no, but we got the guy to tell us that it was 5-MEO-MiPT (Foxy Methoxy, right?). Being the avid reader of trip reports, I remembered that I&#039;d always wanted to try it. I left out the knowledge that it was highly sexual material. Well, me and my friend ended up double-dosing (which we were told NOT to do by the dealer) and we ended up fucking for about 5 minutes. Then my dick started getting limp and I realized what I was doing.<br /><br />Part of me was like HELL YESS FUCK FUCK FUCK HER and the other part of me was like what the fuck, you&#039;re fucking your best friend. She was freaked out too and left the room. I heard her puke in the bathroom and then walk away. She ended up going to another room to wait out the trip. I was stuck in the room, which had become a vortex of psychedelic stars exploding over and over again from my mind. I went through complete ego death, felt like I had been reborn as God, had completely full-blown delusions that I could summon things out of thin air like weed or clothes, or pills. I forgot the importance of wearing clothing, and I even apparently seduced the other guy that had been in the room. I thought that he had been hitting on me, but it had been the other way around. <br /><br />Mind you, sober I and the other guy were completely straight. But we ended up making out at one point and I think in my god-state I believed it to be my duty to pleasure him by fucking him in the ass, which I didn&#039;t. And I&#039;m SO GLAD I didn&#039;t. The 5-Meo held on strong well through the night and into the morning, where I was even more psychotic than before and was strutting around my best friends house with a blanket draped around my naked body like a cape. I found my best friend, completely exposed myself, and shouted &quot;I AM GOD! ISNT THAT GREAT?&quot; I thought that she would appreciate letting God have sex with her at the time. <br /><br />Well, I had to go to work that day. So I went home and tried to get SOME sleep in order to be able to work efficiently. I never slept. And the comedown was so horrible that I seriously contemplated suicide at some points. I took several benadryl and drank lots of water in hopes of detoxing a bit and getting some sleep. I went to work feeling like a worthless piece of shit. I realized how horrible it was that I fucked my best friend, who I knew didn&#039;t even really like guys (turns out she was a lesbian but didn&#039;t know it at the time). I also felt horrible for leading on a STRAIGHT GUY to actually believe that he was in love with me. I don&#039;t know how I did it, but he legitimately told me he would like to consider a relationship between us. Of course I was completely against that. <br /><br />I made it through work, don&#039;t ask me how, but I did. And afterwards I got some 5-htp which helped with the depression and allowed me to eat (I had been throwing up food that I tried to get down, probably because of dehydration). It all turned out ok in the end; I&#039;m still friends with my best friend and the other guy is still straight, though I haven&#039;t seen him go out with any girls since that night. Maybe he was gay all along? Who knows.<br /><br />Figured this was the right story for this thread lol.<br />Also goes to show that alcohol is a horrible combination for decision-making.

				I had a night of regret with a chick I had been dating for a few months. We were using our usual treats at a party when someone had some pills (no idea) and we scarfed them down. Feeling good we moved to one of the upstairs rooms for sex, normal then anal, on the floor by the bed. I&#039;m not big on it, never really figured out what the attraction to it was but she was so fine. As things progressed, I started fucking her ass intensity, it seemed to be enjoyable and I was finding it more enjoyable than norm.&nbsp; Alright just as everything was peaking, she slowed me down and starting to shit. Foggily I think we both realized the situation but neither of us stopped or cared. <br /><br />Now we both pass out, and wake to the biggest mess imaginable.&nbsp; So there I am, in a room, of someone I know, shit literally everywhere in the carpet, with a chick that is useless (fighting with the bitch as she keeps calling the cab company while I hang up on them), still naked, covered in shit, wondering how to handle it. How to handle it hahahaha fuck me. <br /><br />I decide to make useless watch the room and guard it like its full of 10 kilos of pure, so nobody discovers the fucking embarrassment. I head to town, feeling hung as all fuck,&nbsp; to rent a carpet cleaner thing with all the chemicals I can find, tons of rag in a bag packages, and some trash bags. Guess what? When I come back the chick is gone, a group of semi wasted stragglers from the night before who have woken up are starring into the room ooing and ahhing like they are looking at a live Unicorn. I tell them to piss off, put my head down, and fucking clean for hours.<br /><br />Well don&#039;t blame me you wanted to fuckin hear it, needless to say we split after that. <br />The End!<br />

I met this chick in Thailand once (lads holiday) and I want to assert now that SHE WAS NOT A HOOKER. I ain&#039;t really down with shit like that. Anyway we were smashing lined of blow, Mandy, Meph, Ket, speed basically if it was put in front of us we were doing it. One of my mates made this dirty shot called a Hype Slammer which is Mandy, Meph and speed in a shot of JD and I did one in but with tequila (because I have class) anyway this bird walked over to us (Thai) and was like &quot;Oh me and my friends want you to buy us a drink&quot; and we were like wtf? Shouldn&#039;t this be the other way round. Anyway the birds weren&#039;t bad at all 7-8 out of 10 lets say so we went out with them all night and took them back to the hotel. While we were out it was standard, nowt too crazy but when we got back to the hotel it was nuts. They were doing lines off our cocks and giving us BLOW-jobs (coke on the tongue, fuckin amazin). Now this was all great until my friend decided to just take it to the next level. Now everyone always has that one friend who is just ridiculous, we all have them and there is always that one. Anyway this guy was like &quot;I want to snort some Mandy out your arse hole. Now I had my reservations from the word go but yano, fuck it it&#039;s their life ennit. Anyway he smashed up the rock and put it actually in here arse where he&#039;s been fucking her, put the straw in and snorted and then ended up with not only a nice line of Mandy but some stray SHIT UP HIS NOSE TOO. <br /><br />From this day forward his name Poostraw. <br /><br />

				Back in my school days I once shagged the fattest girl in my class, when I say fat I&#039;m talking whale size.. but anyway it happened at a party, in a tent where everyone was listening in and her pussy tasted like damn sweaty tuna mayo (we&#039;ve all been there lads, not good ay). As I was so fucked I couldn&#039;t even get a full hard on but we went at anyway. Very embarrassing and the feelings of deep regret in the morning are just unreal..<br />Lim that story is hilarious, I was waiting for it to turn out to be one of them Thai lady boys you brought back resulting in her whacking out her monster cock. <br />This thread is absolutely genius by the way. ::)

				Hmm well in my wild and woolly youth there were a couple of occasions when I couldn&#039;t remember what I did for more than 24 hours and had no idea where I was, who I was with, or what we had done. Each time was from drinking way to much alcohol. No other drug has ever taken away my memory like alcohol can. No regrets though since i didn&#039;t come down with anything requiring medical attention.

				<br />Well, nothing comes to mind of anything that I REALLY regret. I will have to think about that and come back. <br /><br />Lots of fun crazy roll parties with different shit happening in each room with like 3 or 15 people. <br /><br />My ex GF and I used to eff on shrooms all the time. I loved it cause I could make my dick do anything it seemed on shrooms. <br /><br />However this one time we tripped while she was on the rag. I had made a 4 gram (for each of us) concentrate tea shot from shroom powder. I swear it hit in like 15 minutes HARD! It rattled our brains on the come up. We were in the bedroom just chilling to tunes while tripping and then the next thing we know we were both sitting on the bathroom floor, and I had her bloody tampon dangling in front of our faces. I had pulled it out for some reason. We were looking at each other asking &quot;How did we get here?&quot; ---&quot;What are we doing ?&quot;.&nbsp; We were looking around for blood on ourselves or on the wall but luckily I guess I came out of it before it got messy. We were stuck in the bathroom for about an hour doing nothing. <br /><br />Another time one of my roomies came home from work and I told her I was about to eat shrooms, she said count me in. As soon as it hit she said &quot;SHIT, I need tampons! I&#039;m out! &quot; SO we had to drive to the 7/11 and get that shit. Was a horrible time trying to stay straight while helping this chic out. <br /><br />I no longer trip when a girl is on the rag. <br /><br />

Then as I was leaving I ended up in younger sister&#039;s room(like 2 years behind us i think). She wanted to blaze a j and doesn&#039;t generally do anything. She ends up blazed slobbing my knob when I still haven&#039;t even had time or thought to wash up from her mother LITERALLY 5 MINUTES BEFORE THIS!!!! Mother ended up walking in mid cum streaming money shot to her daughter&#039;s face from the guy that JUST fucked her raw!! Dude....... To this day the shame I have for continuing to exploit these two will haunt me joyfully while I laugh. The mom laughed it off and didn&#039;t make a scene she just shut the door quetly and the daughter never knew. The mother found it somehow hot that I was willing to do both so other terrible suggestions came up. Were stopping the stories here though boy and girls. Those are to the grave tales. Man I used to do some scumbag things back in the day.<br /><br />-BV&nbsp; 8)

				Alcohol made me do the stupidest shit: <br /><br />- fucking chicks of questionable beauty <br />- fucking an underage girl<br />- fucking girls with shady sexual background without condoms&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />- fucking my best friend <br /><br />Things that make you swear the next day that you&#039;re gonna go easy on the alcohol next time but end up forgetting two weeks later.&nbsp;

				OK, since we&#039;re all sharing, here goes with my own confession. Fuck it - none of you know who I am IRL.<br /><br />One of my most hardcore sexual adventure came courtesy of my good friend Mandy. My Uni friends and I (5 males and 4 females) were very loved up and all dancing naked to some very nice 90s tracks (mostly 808 State and Prodigy if my memory serves me well). <br /><br />When we finished dancing, someone came up with the idea of playing a sexy game. Naturally everyone thought it was a good idea. The context for this was a high that comes once in a lifetime. I mean, fuck me, this shit was GOOD. My jaw was so tense I could hardly speak and my eyeballs were fucked up - I could hardly focus I was so high. I loved everyone in the room intensely. Some of the most intense waves of sheer pleasure I have ever experienced. My brain was dopamine drenched and my serotonin rivers had burst their banks.<br /><br />We ended up playing this game the rules of which I don&#039;t understand even to this day. I don&#039;t think there were any coherent rules but the game consisted of someone suggesting or daring that someone else does something sexually hard core and the next person trying to out-do them. I mean, there&#039;s only one direction to move with such a game - and it&#039;s towards a very dark place indeed. <br /><br />A selection of the sexual acts performed that night - the ones I can remember:<br /><br />Female A filled her pussy with white wine and squirted it into a glass which was shared by Male A and Female B. Male C licked the remaining wine out of her pussy as it was (apparently) stinging her..<br /><br />Male C put his finger up male B&#039;s anus in an attempt to find his G spot.<br /><br />Male E and Male B pulled a christmas cracker with their cocks. This involved sticking their cocks into each end of the Christmas cracker and using sellotape to afix it tightly before lurching backwards. Male E attested to receiving power burns on his bishop.<br /><br />The room was candle-lit. Female B made a mold of male A&#039;s penis by dripping hot wax onto her hand and molding it around his erect penis. She filled the mold with orange juice and put it into the freezer in an attempt to make a cock shaped ice lolly (not sure whether this was successful). <br /><br />Female D put 5 maltesers into her vagina with a view to feeding the 5 hungry males, but only 4 came out. Number 5 either melted entirely or travelled deeper into the oft&#039; traversed dark abyss. No one knows.<br /><br />Female B, who was in a relationship with male A. Attempted a blindfold test (a test proposed by female A who suggested that she wouldn&#039;t be able to tell her boyfriend apart from the others by the taste and shape of his cock in her mouth). She passed the taste test, but it was a close call - having narrowed it down to either male A or male E and taking a long time - and several repeated attempts, to make up her mind.<br /><br />At one stage, female C lay on the sofa whilst all of the others (male and female) worked on her body (licking pussy, nipples.caressing body, massaging clit etc) It took fucking ages to get her off but she had a VERY intense orgasm. That was sexy. I still wank thinking about her knocking out that orgasm. Just before she came her face was purple and her legs were shaking with tension.When she came, her entire body quivered. When she finally stood up her legs nearly gave way.<br /><br />After around 4 hours of fun and games, we randomly retired to one of 2 beds.&nbsp; <br /><br />Although this thread is about regret, surprisingly, no-one really seemed to feel in the least bit shameful or regretful after that night. We never had a repeat - at least not to that degree. Even the men who performed moderately homo-erotic acts but didn&#039;t seem to be arsed in the morning. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s all I&#039;m willing to tell. I&#039;ve got another slightly more risque story to tell, but I&#039;ll see how things go. I know that some of you are quite young....wouldn&#039;t want to corrupt anyone.....

				Fuck man, my life is way too dull. Luckily I&#039;m only young, so hopefully that will change. Time to get some fucked up stories of my own! lol.<br /><br />I need new fucking friends. People like you lot! My current friends are so innocent and boring, and take life too seriously for my liking.<br /><br />Edit: Although being ungrateful of friendship is terrible, so I kinda take that back. I just don&#039;t think I have much in common with my friends anymore. I&#039;m so different. I do love &#039;em, and it&#039;s nice to know there are people who care. I just feel like I need change in my life that my friends wouldn&#039;t really understand or agree with.

				Aaaaaaand ^^THAT^^ was my 100th post! I can give karma now biiiiijitches! Look out!<br /><br />I&#039;m with kitkat on this, btw. Alcohol makes me a slut, so now I stick to the drugs instead :)<br /><br />In high school i had a hoyse party while my parents were gone. I drank loooooooots and I was screwing around with this guy I had liked for a while. We ended up having sex in the back of his truck while it was parked in front of our house. Well about 5 minutes into it a car pulls behind us. It&#039;s my fucking parents and they are loading groceries and shit into the house while I&#039;m naked with some guy in the back of his truck. Dude thought it was hilarious, I was just pissed they came home before I got to finish.<br /><br />And holy fuck to the dude who fucks on ketamine. I&#039;ve never tried ket but a girlfriend of mine does it some and she just basically lays on her bead and drools for an hour... Which is why I have no desire to try it.

				I don&#039;t regret much stuff , but let&#039;s see...<br /><br />On mdma, I scissored and exchanged oral sex with my best friend of 8 years. I only regret it because it made our friendship kinda weird and also I was completely out of it, which makes me think there was no way I could have been at my best&nbsp; :o If I was gonna fuck her, I&#039;d prefer to be sober enough to know what I&#039;m doing.<br /><br />I suppose it&#039;s not considered a sexual act, but I find plugging mdma to be much easier when I&#039;m off my tits&nbsp; ::)

				the only sexual act i even sort of regret was a threesome i had with<br />1. my best friend at the time, and<br />2. his girlfriend that i had a mad crush on for quite a long time.<br /><br />she showed me her tits that night(was mardi gras) when he wasnt around, and she was being extremely flirty for sure. she got me to slam a bunch of beers. kept telling me to slam another. then her boyfriend got back and at this point ive slammed like 5 beers in about 10 minutes.<br />he starts pouring shots and we chase them with this sugary ass rootbeer float drink.<br />before i know it im chillin on her chair in the living room and hes in the other room.<br />shes sitting right next to me, closer than usual. she had her hand on my dick for a little bit but heard him coming so she moved her hand.i told her that i was bicurious and i wanted to experiment, so when he walked into the room she told us she wanted to see us kiss<br />he kind of paced around the room thinking about it, you could tell that he was a bit shocked by it. but he eventually sits down on the chair, right across from me. and hes questioning wether or not he wants to do it still. i convince him to just check it out and see, and we sit and make out for a good 30 seconds or so. right after i lay back and i say out loud&quot; yeah im not sure if that turned me on &quot;<br />he put his hand on my dick (i had jeans on) and its started getting hard. he tells her im getting turned on and she grabs my dick as well.<br />im laying on this couch, a drunk mess, while this couple just strokes my dick.<br />they start kissing while they are doing it and they decide we need to go into her bedroom.<br />as soon as we get in there they both start stripping down and im just shocked this shit is happening at this point.<br />i undress and we start fiddling around<br />at first he was giving me head, he eventually stopped and started going down on her. at that point she told me to come over to her side and she gave me head while he went down on her.<br />they eventually have sex and they are both at head level with my cock, and they both gave me head while they had sex.<br />when he finished i asked him if i could have sex with his girlfriend basically, and he said &quot;thats up to her&quot;<br />she looked at me and nodded, so i put it in her. as soon as i started thrusting my friend left the room, obviously bothered.<br />i started to put away my dick and she got so dissapointed, saying it would be okay its not a big deal yadayada.<br />i had whisky dick anyways and it just seemed like a good time to stop.<br />she turns on the lights in her room and my stomach starts killing me<br />i tell her im going to throw up so she gives me this trash can and i seriously projectile vomited into this thing from like 3-4 feet away.<br />she gets me a glass of water and gives me her bed to sleep on,&nbsp; before her and her boyfriend go to sleep in the other room.(on separate furniture O_o)<br /><br />the next day she comes in and wakes me up, and i convince her to kiss me and cuddle with me for a little bit while we are sober. i swear that one kiss and 20 seconds of cuddling was better than the entire night.<br />she eventually makes a point that hes in the other room and he cant see us doing what we are doing.<br /><br />when i finally get up and we are all just chillin, shit is dead silent... we are all in awe at what happened and have no clue what to say to eachother.<br />since then, they have both flirted with me on several occasions...<br /><br />XD <br /><br /><br />

				<br />LOL, another one to add had to do with a roommate of mine. I&#039;m a dude, and have always had girl roommates. (just always sounded more fun). Back when I was like 25 or 26, I had the usual roll party. Plenty of pills and close friends of about 10 or so.&nbsp; Me and one of my roomies were sitting on my bed ( I had 3 girl roomies). But me and this one, rolling face on my bed, staring at each other and smiling. I say to her &quot;you know what Ive always wanted to do&quot; she said &quot;what&quot;, I say &quot;kiss you&quot;. The next thing she does is get up and locked the door ( or so we thought) comes back and we start kissing. Clothes are coming off and we are talkin all lovey shit. Friends and other roomies walk in to see where we were at and we had each others face buried into each others crotch 69 style squeezing each others legs tight. We were moaning and shit till she felt someone tapping on her and we was like &quot;what?&quot; She smiled and said that we were dating now! I remember thinking where the fuck did that come from. I rolled with it and even felt the good vibes the next morning anyways. The following couple months were hell though, we tried that shit instead of saying we were just effd up that night. BAD IDEA in this case. Eventually we worked through it and remained friends and continued to live together. That was a tender sticky situation though for me. Delicious times never the less. We still speak regularly after a decade.

				The roommate story got me thinking for some reason about something I did but didn&#039;t really regret. Was flirting with a Barista at Starbucks for weeks, eventually asked her if she ever did X and she was all &quot;Fuck Yeah I do X&quot;. She managed to score a handful of pills for us somehow and I went over to her place and we spent the night falling insanely in love. I could go on for hours about the depths of this fall. Think jumping off Niagara Falls sort of fall and you&#039;ll get the idea. Like 8 years later and my heart still melts when I think about her..<br /><br />The issue of course with MDMA induced love is not so much that it&#039;s not real but it often isn&#039;t piratical. She was pretty much a full fledged lesbian and I was in a pretty committed relationship that wasn&#039;t exactly easy to leave. We continued a little affair but it was never enough, the rapid escalation of our feelings for each other that night demanded an all or nothing survival strategy and neither of us could commit to being all in.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had a heart break quite as hard as that one. We&#039;re both in separate and happy relationships now but there&#039;s still the part of me that wishes things had turned out a little differently.<br /><br />The moral of the story of course is be careful who you kiss while on MDMA. Love is just a series of neurochemical responses and whether you find it on drugs or not the reality is just the same.

(about a month on now) only problem she has a boyfriend.. long ting. <br />Usually (without rolling with girl) it takes a lot for me to develop feelings for someone but its almost like MDMA destroys this barrier and lets you connect with them whilst rolling and the feelings last.<br />Does anyone else get this? Must be something to do with the oxytocin hormone release during the roll, but who knows...

				Well I actually remember the date because I was traveling for an event and we had planed a dream night together while I was in town that melted into the reality of neither of us being able to make it work. It was the last time we spoke.<br /><br />Appreciate your comments, I actually love writing (books normally, but evidently forum posts when otherwise uninspired). That little snapshot in time provided a new vocabulary for expression that I would feel muted without. And no, it definitely wasn&#039;t just the sex although that was part of it:<br /><br />Her mother was insane, to the point of being incapable of raising her. Her father was disabled and died when she was young. Her boyfriend became husband tried to kill her and very nearly did. Her child at a young age survived a disease that kills almost everyone that gets it and lives in constant threat of remission. Her life was personified by pain, hurt, abuse and neglect. She was the most wounded soul I had ever encountered and yet she had this innate hope that refused to die, she would be loved.<br /><br />It might not sound like much but the simple fact that this girl could survive what she had, and the above is a snapshot not a portrait of her trials, and still look at the world ready to love and be loved was just fucking incredible to me. It made me look at who I was and the sorrows I carried around and realize that they were gifts from the universe given to me not to make me suffer but to appreciate more fully all the overwhelming lightness of being in those infrequent shadows of darkness.<br /><br />One of these days I&#039;m going to write a story for her but I think even years later I&#039;m still soaking it all in.<br /><br />All right, I&#039;ll get off my soapbox now!

				Night of the office Christmas dinner, and the food has suck, and i&#039;ve basically been doing bumps of Lim&#039;s finest mephe all day long (fuckin slow working days in the run up to Christmas), and a few friends and i decide we need to continue a the party...

				Heres a story that ill remember forever.<br />Me and my two friends. both guys. we all headover to my house with a handle of sailor jerry.<br />After about a 1/3 of it is gone. my first friend A gets a call from his friend that watns to come over and hangout. but B has to go home.<br />So i start driving B home and then as son as we get to his house he changes he mind and wants to see friend C (a girl). I say whatever<br />and the 4 of us meet back to finish the rest of the handle. Now C likes A somewhat and they tease eachother all night while me and B are kind of<br />left out. So A and C go upstairs to my room and try to start fucking. i get in there before anything goes on and block whats happening...thats my bed hahah.So C starts begging me for a few minutes so that her and A can fuck. but i kinda just say no and shrug it off. So now we all move to the guest room. A and C are sleeping on the floor and B is in the bed. I climb into the bed with B(who i generally have a silly gay crush on i suppose im bi...) He<br />has always remained assertive that hes straight and ends up throwing a drunk hissy fit that im in the bed with him and storms out of the room.<br />next thing i know A and C crawl into the bed and the C looks at me and is like &#039;this doesnt leave this house&#039; and starts making out with me. Im like wow glad B left haha. So we all get naked and she starts to blow me and my friend A. unfortunately i have quite the time trying to get hard to fuck this chick. She wasnt a total hotttie but everytime i got it up to fuck her, A said to give him a bit longer. and by the time he was done..i would be limp again.<br />So then im sucking on her tits and A is fucking her. Then out of nowhere B comes back inside. and is like wtf is going on. A is like. come on bro get in on this. hes like omg no thats weird and im not gay. so after some convincing he takes off his clothes. And B eats out C for a good while while im working her tits and mouth.A is just watching us telling C how much she likes it.&nbsp; So eventually C climbs on top of B and (he can hardly get it up either) he complains for a condom and gets one. and She starts to ride him a bit. Maybe he didnt last long or something cause after a minute or two he got up and put the condom on my tv(asshole!!) Finally!! i was hard and no one was fucking her. so i did. Me and A and B have all talked about the night. But B was just mad that is was so awkward. But thats the stuff memories are made of. Anyways. Thats how me and B lost our virginities. within minutes of eachother. With the same girl hahahaha

				MMF on cannabis. <br /><br />It started with a glance at a friend from high school, let&#039;s call him J. I was dating his best friend, and didn&#039;t realize at the time that it was close to a sibling bond and nothing sexual between them. Anyway, he was bisexual, which was known since we went to school. I&#039;d never been with a guy, and he made me feel comfortable with the thought of kissing another man. It was late at night at his place, and having a cigarette with him I gave him the eye I give women I want to fuck.<br /><br />&quot;I didn&#039;t know you were bi,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;No one does,&quot; I shrugged and we went inside and to the bedroom.<br /><br />I got on top of him, kissing, then grinding our cocks together. The foreplay was no different than when I&#039;m with women, and the mechanics weren&#039;t much different for that matter either. My girlfriend came to bed, and I mistakenly insisted she be in the middle. J told her to be on the outside and me in the middle. I put her hand on his cock and she broke in to hysterical laughter, filled with anxiety. I was mostly confused at this, not understanding the relationship they had. J brushed it off and we continued. <br /><br />One of the things I remembered about J was his ability to deepthroat, which he demonstrated on at least one occasion with a banana at school. It was the best blowjob anyone has ever given me. I tried to reciprocate, but never came close. We finished each other by hand and crashed.<br /><br />My regret was not getting in the middle when my girlfriend came to bed. I talked to her the next day about it, and she was fine with everything. The laughter was the terror that she might fuck J, which she thought of as a brother.

Shouldn&#039;t this be the other way round. Anyway the birds weren&#039;t bad at all 7-8 out of 10 lets say so we went out with them all night and took them back to the hotel. While we were out it was standard, nowt too crazy but when we got back to the hotel it was nuts. They were doing lines off our cocks and giving us BLOW-jobs (coke on the tongue, fuckin amazin). Now this was all great until my friend decided to just take it to the next level. Now everyone always has that one friend who is just ridiculous, we all have them and there is always that one. Anyway this guy was like &quot;I want to snort some Mandy out your arse hole. Now I had my reservations from the word go but yano, fuck it it&#039;s their life ennit. Anyway he smashed up the rock and put it actually in here arse where he&#039;s been fucking her, put the straw in and snorted and then ended up with not only a nice line of Mandy but some stray SHIT UP HIS NOSE TOO. <br /><br />From this day forward his name Poostraw.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />HAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br /><br />this shit is fucking classic holy fuck

We were using our usual treats at a party when someone had some pills (no idea) and we scarfed them down. Feeling good we moved to one of the upstairs rooms for sex, normal then anal, on the floor by the bed. I&#039;m not big on it, never really figured out what the attraction to it was but she was so fine. As things progressed, I started fucking her ass intensity, it seemed to be enjoyable and I was finding it more enjoyable than norm.&nbsp; Alright just as everything was peaking, she slowed me down and starting to shit. Foggily I think we both realized the situation but neither of us stopped or cared. <br /><br />Now we both pass out, and wake to the biggest mess imaginable.&nbsp; So there I am, in a room, of someone I know, shit literally everywhere in the carpet, with a chick that is useless (fighting with the bitch as she keeps calling the cab company while I hang up on them), still naked, covered in shit, wondering how to handle it. How to handle it hahahaha fuck me. <br /><br />I decide to make useless watch the room and guard it like its full of 10 kilos of pure, so nobody discovers the fucking embarrassment. I head to town, feeling hung as all fuck,&nbsp; to rent a carpet cleaner thing with all the chemicals I can find, tons of rag in a bag packages, and some trash bags. Guess what? When I come back the chick is gone, a group of semi wasted stragglers from the night before who have woken up are starring into the room ooing and ahhing like they are looking at a live Unicorn. I tell them to piss off, put my head down, and fucking clean for hours.<br /><br />Well don&#039;t blame me you wanted to fuckin hear it, needless to say we split after that. <br />The End!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That really made me laugh quite a few times!!<br /><br />I fucking love sex-on-MDMA. It&#039;s like being right at the verge of coming but for hours. It can get frustrating towards the end (past the peak of intoxication) if you have been redosing and finally do want to come, but for those first few hours it&#039;s just amazing, and when you&#039;ve reached the time of actually wanting to come, you&#039;re fucking that intensely due to the near-inability to come, that the girlfriend just keeps having body-spazzing orgasms. If you don&#039;t take too much, and you don&#039;t actively decide to resist coming at the beginning of the session (I usually try to put off coming early on), then you can come, and be right back up for it again after not very long anyway.<br />There&#039;s the extra niceness of the cuddling, and kissing is amazing too - you literally want to slurp up the contents of her mouth. Girlfriend&#039;s nipples are more erect than ever, breasts somehow more pert than ever, and juices are just oozing out everywhere. Scrotum and balls become tight as hell up against the body. All inhibitions are gone and you end up doing things you&#039;d never normally do like filming, or trying anal (never succeeded and never normally feel the need to anyway) or whatever.<br /><br />I do miss sex-on-X :(<br /><br />I wish I could find a way to be at least a little bit as horny and driven as that on a normal basis though. I kind of feel like I was doing it to make up for my lackluster performance when not intoxicated.

				OMG. I wish I had read these BEFORE I posted that shit in CharlesFloyds thread about funny shit you did on coke. Now I don&#039;t feel so depraved. Hell. Yes I do. <br /><br />&quot;Drugs are neat. And you can find them relatively cheap. And when you do them people think that you&#039;re cool. (repeat) Drugs are good. They make you do the things you know you not should.&quot; NOFX<br /><br />Edit: I do not regret that shit at all actually. Live without regrets and you&#039;ll die a happy man.

				I broke down recently one night, and let an obvious evil fembot violate me.
