				Each decade has it&#039;s own unique defining drug culture, here&#039;s my breakdown of each decades definitive drugs:<br /><br />50&#039;s - Amphetamines<br />60&#039;s - LSD<br />70&#039;s - Cocaine and Marijuana<br />80&#039;s - Cocaine and Crack Cocaine<br />90&#039;s - Ecstasy and Heroin<br />00&#039;s - Mephedrone, Crystal Methamphetamine, Ketamine, Prescription Meds (legal highs too?)<br />Feel free to debate the above. <br /><br />My question to the forum is: &#039;What in your opinion is THE definitive drug of our generation?&#039; The drug that&#039;s consistently making the headlines, has it&#039;s risks blown out of proportion, has it&#039;s own youth culture backing it, is cheap, plentiful, and easy to acquire? Discuss :)

				Choice, and research chems are cool and all but hardly representative of a generation. Certainly not like LSD in the 60s or Cocaine in the 80s. Silk Road and 2CB is hardly mainstream. <br /><br />I agree with the others saying MDMA. I&#039;d say Ecstasy for the 90s (pills) and MDMA for the 00&#039;s. Or at least in the last couple of years, MDMA crystals have become the norm. <br /><br />Hugely popular .. not just in the &quot;dance&quot; scene, but all different groups. <br /><br />

				By choice I meant that I don&#039;t think anything defines the generation now because people are just too diverse now. It&#039;s more that everyone is on it and they are on everything for every kind of reason you can think of and so choice is what defines us maybe?

				I kinda agree with those here who say it&#039;s about the choices we have now.<br />One thing that seems true to me though, we seem to be converging onto the theme of love once again. Not since the mid 1960&#039;s have we been on the crest of such a monumental shift. The Mayans didn&#039;t predict the end of the world. They predicted a paradigm shift. I have a feeling that we are headed there and psychedelics in particular are pointing us in the right direction. As with all times, this is an exciting time to be alive :D

				this is a good topic. from my perspective in the US i&#039;d say it breaks down like this:<br /><br />90s = crystal meth and rolls<br />2000-2010 = &quot;molly&quot;, chronic weed, and Rx drugs, especially alprazolam (xanax) and oxycodone (roxis and OCs)<br /><br />my vote would probably be on the last one for the 00s<br /><br />2010-2020 = &quot;research chemicals&quot; and ever more exotic cannabis preparations and specialized methods of consuming thc (oils, waxs, extracts and beyond)

				When i started it was all about the weed personally. But E&#039;s were huge here. I remember they were going as cheap as £0.50 for a spell!<br /><br />2000-2010 = MDMA + SOAPBAR (still looking for the fucker who did this to us stoners, fake nasty shit whos creator should be forcefed a bar, straight down his fucking throat)<br />2010-????? = Monkey madness (what a stupid fucking name for a drug :o)<br /><br />Definitely all about the research chems now no matter how much i hate them. Bath salts and legal highs almost destroyed my town. And to think grass is still illegal. Salvia was ok i guess but that would be it, not a recreational drug by any means. LSA from woodrose seeds i think it was, was ok i guess also. <br /><br />Alcohol of caffeine could be contenders but theyre no fun compared to the others out there
