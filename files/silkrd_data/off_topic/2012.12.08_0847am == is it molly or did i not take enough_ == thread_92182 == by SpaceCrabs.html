				at 2:20 am i ate a bump of molly about the size of the S where it says &quot;Silk road forums.&quot; I dont have a scale so i don&#039;t know exactly how much i took. it was supposed to be .5mg and i divided it into 5 so, give or take 100mg unless f16 ripped me off. Anyways at 3 i felt my heart raced A LOT, my eye dilated, i hopped around like a dinosaur, i ran a bit, and my temperature went up. I was very excited and was smiling hard, by 3:20 I sat down and relaxed. My heart rate stabalized. but i feel, nothing feel or looks different. My head hurts though. im not smiling just bored. where i am its 3:46am<br /><br />I dont feel like sex. what happaned?<br /><br />can someone post a pic of what 100mg of molly looks like?<br /><br />edit: i took a yohimbe capsule 2000mg yohimbe extract(i heard it was a MAOI) AND ATE GRAPEFRUIT

				You should at least get a scale before ingesting unknown chemicals into your body. :(

				I&#039;m sorry, but you&#039;re an idiot. From what I could gather from your original post, it seems like the MDMA was working and of high quality, as you only took ~100mg. The comedown effects you described are normal.<br />You also eyeballed your dose and mixed it with another chemical that it known to alter the effects of MDMA. This shit is entirely your fault. Why the fuck do you accuse f16 of selling low-quality stuff?<br />Oh and not everyone gets horny from MDMA. It is known to have very different effects on different people.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92182.msg649789#msg649789">Quote from: SpaceCrabs on December 08, 2012, 09:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">i feel sick when i get up i feel nauses and heavy fuck f16 he needs to die<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sounds like you fucked up your serotonin system. Wait a few days and maybe take some 5-HTP and you should be fine.

				Hard to say man. Get a scale and take it without the yohimbe bullshit. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92182.msg649852#msg649852">Quote from: acidhead on December 08, 2012, 11:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">MAOI + MDMA = serotonin syndrome<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That&#039;s what I was thinking. But I wasn&#039;t sure. And that does sounds like very mild SS.

				Ahhhh thanks guys i feel much better now, i understand my stupidity. I had no idea you could get sick like that, I&#039;ve heard of people using MAOI and E togther so i tried yohimbe bark extract along side with it. So the serotonin syndrome fizzles out the experience and makes you sick?&nbsp; And it came down way too quick at about 20 mins, almost instant, then i had about 4 hours of nausea and a speeding heart beat everytime i tried to stand up, and i swear to god that i was having auditory hallucinations<br /><br />I&#039;m going to lay off the stuff for a bit i fear for my serotonin receptors. And this experience has definitely taught how important it is to have a scale, my childishness got the better of me, i just felt like such a gangsta eyeballing 2c-i. <br /><br />I never learn till&#039; something goes wrong.<br /><br />Thanks again guys, i love you &lt;3<br /><br />&nbsp;
