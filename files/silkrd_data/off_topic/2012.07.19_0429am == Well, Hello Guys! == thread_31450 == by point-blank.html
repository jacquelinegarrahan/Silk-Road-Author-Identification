				Good afternoon<br /><br />Well, to tell you the truth guys its my first week being here on the undernet (darknet, deepnet, whatever you guys call it) after a month of research about it and finally i was able to lurk into its domain, even though i do not have much knowledge about it as of now. And one thing i realized was that i&#039;m still a noob when it comes to this dark society. The feeling is like most of the free minded people of the world are the ones who are lurking in here.<br /><br />My thoughts about the undernet is that its a cool community with helpful, friendly, and, well, some rude people. i was able to see a lot of stories and more information about it. hacking :), SR, gladiator fights (no info about it yet, anyone?) and some chans/boards. i admit that i&#039;m still a noob here but i&#039;ll go and lurk more in here than staying in the surface web. i hope i can get some more info from you guys.<br /><br />SR: this forum actually gave me a place where i do belong. i&#039;m not that much when it comes to other drugs. i tried ecstacy, some coke that gave me a ride of my life. a few LSD. but only one thing will give me the contentment in my mood and mind. Weed! Yep that&#039;s right! those THC rich buds that keeps me high, relaxed, stress free, concentrated and gives me that deep - thought feeling. and it seems that SR also gave me a way to check out on the shit that i can get and will give me more knowledge about other stuf that i haven&#039;t tried to take yet. especially the ones that i haven&#039;t tried yet. <br /><br />i&#039;ve been puffing some pot for 3 years now and its been a good time when i&#039;m under the influence of it. especially that i do work so i can have my own income and still go to college. it unstressed me when i&#039;m home and compared to other shits that i&#039;ve tried, gave me munchies, and a good dosage of laugh and stories to tell. this one became my forte and the one that i&#039;m comfortable with. well, i just shared my point of view.<br /><br />Thank you guys and hopefully you&#039;ll be more welcome to me in SR. :) keep safe everyone!
