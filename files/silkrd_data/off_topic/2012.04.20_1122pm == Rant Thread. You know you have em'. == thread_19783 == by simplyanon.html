				Alright, where to fucking start.<br /><br />1- I fucking like numbered lists, deal with it. Shit makes me feel all organized and shit.<br /><br />2- 48 fucking hours for Moneypak to BTC transfer? Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?! Holy shit. If I knew it was gonna take longer to get BTC from this than it takes a woman to give birth, I would have went with wm-centers ridiculous 30$ fucking fee and WUs OTHER ridiculous 30$ fucking fee. I just want an order each of Delta11&#039;s brownies, chocolates and sodas. Thats IT. THAT IS ALL I WANT IN LIFE RIGHT NOW. Fuck.<br /><br />3- Its 4/20 and I&#039;m so fucking sick that when I try to toke, I fucking throw up. What BULLSHIT is this?!? I have an 1/8 of some dank ass bud just bustin a chill on my dresser, because no one wants to chill with the sick fucker. (Not that I blame them.) I have NO drugs. None. No xanax. Nothing. I want to hurt things.<br /><br />4- To top it all off, my fucking computer is being a stupid bitch. I broke the monitor by punching the shit out of it repeatedly. If I paid more than 50$ for it I&#039;d be pissed at myself. <br /><br />5- My cats in heat and wont shut the fuck up. Annoying bitch.<br /><br /><br />Now that that&#039;s off my chest, I feel much better. :)<br /><br />Not really, but whatever.
