				With June right around the corner, Warped Tour, MayhemFest, and Summer Slaughter are soon to arrive to a city near you. I&#039;m not sure about MayhemFest, since it&#039;s the same crappy main-stream bands headling again this year, but I&#039;m sure to visit Warped Tour and Summer Slaughter for a couple of my favorite bands. <br /><br />Warped Tour: After The Burial, Born of Osiris, Chelsea Grin<br />Summer Slaughter: Veil of Maya and The Contortionist.<br /><br />All Metalheads weigh in with your favorite bands!<br /><br />By the way, if you haven&#039;t heard of them yet: I recommend you give After The Burial a listen. Their vocal message, guitar shredding amazingness, and instrumental synergy is rivaled by no other band. Just my opinion of course, but give these couple of songs a listen: Cursing Akhenaten, Drifts, Berserker. If you&#039;re a fan of amazing riffs and breakdowns, these songs provide amazing examples of both. In addition, they&#039;re fucking inspiring and provide me with a motive to lead a life without mediocrity of any sort.

				So..Can we just be best friends already?<br /><br />I went to Summer Slaughter last year and it was awesome.<br /><br />Just looked at this year&#039;s lineup, and I almost shit myself.<br />Job For A Cowboy<br />Between the Buried and Me<br />Veil of Maya<br /><br />*drool*<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been to Warped Tour in quite a few years, 6 to be exact. I just don&#039;t find it appealing anymore. And the only band worth seeing at Mayhem is, imo, Whitechapel, and possibly even The Devil Wears Prada. Their latest album was actually pretty decent, and may be worth seeing.<br /><br />sdesu

Thus, I can self-rationalize spending 60 bucks to see them. As far as TDWP goes, they just aren&#039;t my cup of tea I suppose. That I&#039;m So Fly remix was the shiznit though&nbsp; 8)
