				It doesn&#039;t have so much instability because it doesn&#039;t have users. That is not the fault of SR, but a limitation of how much Tor can scale. If SR wants to fix this issue one thing they can do is use two different .onion domains that point to the same thing. When one becomes overloaded the other will still work. That is what Freenode did once they couldn&#039;t scale with the amount of users using their IRC server over the hidden service anymore.

				Hmmmm <br /><br />This kind of competition would only work in the case where SilkRoad would go down permanently. I&#039;ve created a test account, the layout is okay, but really there doesn&#039;t seem to have much traffic. However, one thing I would get excited about is the Litecoin implementation. <br /><br />As a Litecoin lover I would love to see such an implementation on the SilkRoad.

				With time it will get more and more users. And maybe in a near future it can function as a temporary/secondary marketplace for silkroad if it&#039;s down for maintainance a longer period. A new thing is they have implemented bitcoin payment now, not only litecoins anymore.

				why do you guys think Atlantis is so fast now ? You guessed it, theres about 6 users on it. <br /><br />Did you ever notice how when SR is down for a while and then its backup its really really fast.. then 30 minutes later its slow again once everyone figures out its back up......<br /><br /><br />I haven&#039;t checked out Atlantis in a couple of weeks but don&#039;t they only accept LTC or do they take BTC now ?

				I find it hard in this place to have a discussion without it turning into a fight or someone taking things to heart. It&#039;s just an open discussion.&nbsp; &nbsp;No conspiracies, or mass exodus, nobody recommending anything.&nbsp; Just saying stuff around the water cooler.

				You guys sound pretty paranoid about Atlantis yet you trust SR dearly with your money and personal info? Doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been an active seller there ever since they&#039;ve opened, under different nick selling different thing though. I&#039;ve had a few great transactions, everything went smooth.<br /><br />I love the improvements they&#039;ve made compared to SR - it&#039;s a LOT easier to list, search, they even have &quot;verified&quot; vendors (those who can prove their vendor account on SR). Atlantis staff is pretty responsive to requests for new functionality and such - for example, it was my request that got their fees lowered below SR&#039;s. <br /><br />If there&#039;s anything I hate about SR it&#039;s how slow it is and how OLD their web UI is. Seeing what Atlantis has done, makes me wonder why isn&#039;t SR improving if it&#039;s raking in $millions every month. Why aren&#039;t they innovating? You seriously think that they don&#039;t have resources to speed up their site or protect from DDOS given how much money they have? It&#039;s just laziness I think. Maybe competition will finally cause them to get off their ass.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love SR and have been on it for years, but they CAN and SHOULD do better in some areas.<br /><br />And yes, Atlantis forums are shit because nobody ever goes there. So what - Litecoin forums are also shit yet people buy and sell with it.<br /><br />Atlantis vendor startup costs and fees are a _lot_ lower because that&#039;s the only way they&#039;ll attract users as a new market. They accept LTC. They have plenty of vendors with established feedback. Stop bitching people and go make an account and buy/sell something. <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re bitching and whining like DPR has got his dick shoved far up your ass. You should be HAPPY that there&#039;s now TWO markets for US Govt to worry about shutting down; SR is no longer a single point of failure.

I&#039;ve had a few great transactions, everything went smooth.<br /><br />I love the improvements they&#039;ve made compared to SR - it&#039;s a LOT easier to list, search, they even have &quot;verified&quot; vendors (those who can prove their vendor account on SR). Atlantis staff is pretty responsive to requests for new functionality and such - for example, it was my request that got their fees lowered below SR&#039;s. <br /><br />If there&#039;s anything I hate about SR it&#039;s how slow it is and how OLD their web UI is. Seeing what Atlantis has done, makes me wonder why isn&#039;t SR improving if it&#039;s raking in $millions every month. Why aren&#039;t they innovating? You seriously think that they don&#039;t have resources to speed up their site or protect from DDOS given how much money they have? It&#039;s just laziness I think. Maybe competition will finally cause them to get off their ass.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love SR and have been on it for years, but they CAN and SHOULD do better in some areas.<br /><br />And yes, Atlantis forums are shit because nobody ever goes there. So what - Litecoin forums are also shit yet people buy and sell with it.<br /><br />Atlantis vendor startup costs and fees are a _lot_ lower because that&#039;s the only way they&#039;ll attract users as a new market. They accept LTC. They have plenty of vendors with established feedback. Stop bitching people and go make an account and buy/sell something. <br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re bitching and whining like DPR has got his dick shoved far up your ass. You should be HAPPY that there&#039;s now TWO markets for US Govt to worry about shutting down; SR is no longer a single point of failure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sensible sound argument!

				I think its a cool place to poke around, personally I would probably wait till vendors get up in the 100&#039;s of sales to make a buy of my own, SR does not bother me at all, the constant maintenence is a sign of a good thing, and un patient people should GTFO if it pisses them off so bad instead of complaining about it with long stupid forum posts. Lol not like I am a 14 year old kid using SR like its my facebook and have to login every 10 minutes lol

				I just posted this on the Atlantis forum, but just trying to gauge what other readers think:<br /><br />If Atlantis does continue to grow and gain popularity I&#039;ll be very interested to see how they will deal with the increased server loads, daily attacks and constant attention that SR has had to deal with over the past few years. <br /><br />SR has never had a true competitor, and it seems Atlantis has the potential to fill that role, but it is still very early to tell. Also, competition is good, but it is good for both parties. Atlantis is basically a carbon copy of SR with really no new innovative features. If Atlantis begins to offer better features or improvements, who is to say that SR will not just as easily counter back? No real competition has allowed SR to remain content with minor improvements here and there, but no real need to innovate. Now that Atlantis has come along with a &quot;smoother&quot; look and feel, who is to say that SR will not improve immensely by learning or copying their competitors ideas?<br /><br />Atlantis has no where near the reputation that SR has established and it&#039;s still hard to say how legitimate it is or will be. They seem to preach strong security practices, but with features such as &quot;auto-pgp encrypted messages&quot; who is to say that the server is not recording and logging all the data? Is Atlantis an LE operation? How long will it take for Atlantis to gain the trust and respect that SR has accumulated since its inception?<br /><br />I&#039;m relatively indifferent one way or the other, just pointing out some food for thought.<br />

Encrypting on your own solves that problem.<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking out of my ass either.

Atlantis _will encrypt_ messages sent to your inbox that senders _didn&#039;t already encrypt_, using your public PGP key. This is entirely transparent to sender and receiver. Sender doesn&#039;t have to rely on Atlantis to do the encryption; in fact, sender will never know whether his/her un-encrypted message will be encrypted at destination.<br /><br />This is just an extra layer of security Atlantis provides should someone compromise their servers and gain ability to read people&#039;s inboxes or order lists.

				Atlantis is missing one crucial piece: DPR. Do you trust anyone else to run a website which is carrying thousands of BTC at any given time? I don&#039;t. If DPR was planning on pulling off the greatest scam of all time, he would have done it by now. I don&#039;t know who runs Atlantis, but I&#039;m hesitant to say the least. Plus DPR has proven he and his team can overcome security and other website issues. What will Atlantis do when they have a DoS attack, or a sudden increase in traffic, or attempts by LE to hack in and get information? I&#039;d be wary if I were you.

				So, I checked out that Atlantis site, and it took at least 20-30 seconds to load.&nbsp; Silk Road, when operating at full capacity, is near instantaneous these days.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t even noticed a decline in service as I haven&#039;t been around the past few days. Atlantis just seemed like a shady Silk Road rip-off to me.&nbsp; Same categories, mostly empty.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ll leave it up to people with disposable BTC and brass bawls to test it out.&nbsp; I&#039;m happy with Silk Road.&nbsp; I mean, come on people.&nbsp; Silk Road, even with it&#039;s occasional hiccups, is still incredible and amazing.

				nyancat, the whole point of encrypting your address is to hide it from the server and marketplace admins, in case they are compromised.<br /><br />When you post your plaintext address into their &quot;PGP encryption&quot; text box, you are passing that plaintext into some JavaScript variable and you are trusting that the encryption is done in browser, then passed to the server. However, they can modify the code at any time to transmit the plaintext back to their servers and store it. You&#039;d have to check the JavaScript *every time* to be sure it isn&#039;t malicious, and even then it may be obfuscated.<br /><br />In other words, it&#039;s a system that works as long as they aren&#039;t compromised, and fails when they are compromised, making it totally useless.<br /><br />Do you understand now? If you trust them to do the encryption, then you are trusting them with your plaintext address, so you might as well just post the plaintext.<br /><br />A better solution is to encrypt your address on your computer and only post encrypted text blocks into the browser.<br />

				First, this horse has been beaten to death - LE can, has and will sell you weapons, drugs and anything else in the pursuit of &quot;justice&quot; while protecting their undercover assets.&nbsp; If you think operation Fast and Furious or Iran Contra made everyone in LE suddenly say, oh we should be more ethical about our undercover operations, you are stupid.&nbsp; Of course they aren&#039;t going to bust customers for 1/4 ounce orders of pot and a few pills, they want vendors. (which is why the emphasis on vendor services and verification that requires a direct line to SR on this Atlantis sounds fishy to me).<br /><br />Why do I trust SR more than Atlantis, BMR or any other site?&nbsp; Several reasons:<br /><br />1) Because they were first, and they did it not to be popular, but to provide a service and make some coin.&nbsp; This place has experience on their resume.<br />2) LE wasn&#039;t turned on to this site right-off, it wasn&#039;t until the congressional hearing that many officers had even heard of the road.<br />3) Newer sites springing up after SR COULD be honeypots because of the frustration in countering SR.&nbsp; How do you de-anonymize TOR users? By operating a malicious endpoint specifically configured to do so.&nbsp; LE wouldn&#039;t have originally set up a shop to innovate a whole new market for drugs, but LE can look at this wonderful example and build their own. <br />4) I didn&#039;t just jump into SR buying shit left-right and center my first day.&nbsp; I watched, and waited.&nbsp; I lurked here for almost three months before I even registered.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen illegal drug sites taken down by LE, and it isn&#039;t pretty.&nbsp; I would advise new vendors to be cautious of Atlantis.<br />5) Atlantis vendor verification (as stated above) seeks to create a link between your SR vendor accounts and theirs - thereby creating a link in a possible chain of evidence.&nbsp; You don&#039;t even have to sell anything on Atlantis to be caught if it&#039;s a honeypot and you&#039;ve verified, they can just correlate your vendor accounts and look at your listings and feedback.<br /><br />I sincerely hope they are legit, but it makes no sense for anyone to be so hostile towards SR as Master IS.&nbsp; Do you hate the entire mall because they have a payless shoe store, or a roof leak every couple months?&nbsp; I could see being frustrated with the situation, but not being so hostile.&nbsp; Did SR kick you in the balls Master?

				Atlantis reeks of DESPERATION and when desperation is involved people eventually do terrible shit to each other... breaks down like this:<br /><br />1) Atlantis (or someone trolling as Atlantis) desperate for users, posts to SR&#039;s own forums to stir up shit on SR to promote Atlantis. SHITTY BITCHES Step 1.<br /><br />2) While 1 is happening, Atlantis is using SR as part of their perception of security -- verified vendors are vendors 1st verified on... you guessed it, SR! So you have one site abusing a site and then relying on the same site to pump up their security. SHITTY BITCHES Step 2.<br /><br />3) Atlantis trying to convince people that arbitrary site features are SOOOOO FUCKING IMPORTANT. When the reality is, we&#039;re all FUCKING LUCKY that SR takes security so seriously. High security typically means less usability -- that&#039;s a &quot;good thing&quot;. Atlantis apparently prefers promoting flashy site design over security concerns (Server-side PGP? Srs? So you REALLLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT USER SECURITY WHEN IT BECOMES A LITTLE INCONVENIENT? So, SHITTY BITCHES Step 3.<br /><br />4) The obvious scumbag / virus tactics... sleaze up to something like SR, replicated it enough as an alternative site, create a perception of advantage via some false notion of &quot;ease of use&quot;, then attract idiots who don&#039;t know any better. SHITTY BITCHES Step 4.<br /><br />5) If Atlantis were serious about overcoming what it call SR&#039;s shortcomings, it would work to solve them, not replace them. That is an easy measure of integrity right there. So, SHITTY BITCHES Step 5!<br /><br />In just 5 easy steps, we show that Atlantis is clearly nothing but SHITTY BITCHES who prefer underhanded tactics and prioritizing &quot;ease of use&quot; over &quot;better security for all&quot;. <br /><br /><br />SOOOOOO, if anyone you knew behaved like Atlantis has in any of 5 steps above, would you trust them with your life? (cause, yes, believe it peeps... your life is at stake here!)<br /><br />Meanwhile DPR stands for something more than just profit: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter His actions show the person he is time and time again... And yes, that is important and yes, it counts!<br /><br />Call me a DPR / SR fan boy, it&#039;s all you can do to hide from the fact that DPR / SR actions and words are aligned as one in the same. TOP THAT ATLANTIS! Can&#039;t wait to see your bullshit copycat charter page! Let&#039;s see how hollow your copycat words are!?<br /><br /><br />And yes, having multiple reliable markets who share the same need for security is great but when a new market comes along and cannot even see that we&#039;re all stronger together, rather than promote some pithy differences, dividing us, and all for their own perceived advantage!? ULTRA-MEGA-FAIL<br /><br /><br />Fact is, some people will do anything for profit or perceived advantage. Not saying Atlantis is LE (looks like it to me, but hey), but at least DPR stands for something more than just profit. <br /><br />Yep, sorry kids, but bullshit profit motives cannot last, by their own design! &quot;Increased efficiency through automation = no workforce&quot; anyone? Apparently it is not clear to some that money is not going to be around forever, as it increasingly &amp; fundamentally limits our progress as a species. True that money &amp; differential advantage was useful to our species for a while, but that time is slowly ending! Hurrahh!<br /><br />Anyone ANYONE who doesn&#039;t see Atlantis for what it is: so desperate that &quot;we&#039;ll do anything for a buck&quot; and that such thinking will eventually land their users in shit (perhaps rightly so, for their own stupidity), is fucking &#039;ignant!<br /><br />Just saying ;)

Like I said in another post in reference to why Atlantis is &quot;faster&quot; then SR.. :<br />Because there&#039;s a total of 8 people on that site. 4 feds, 2 customers, 1 disgraced&amp;banned vendor from here, and 1 vendor selling everything from weed to crack.<br />who only accepts Litecoins.<br />SR is The Godfather. And Atlantis reminds me of a direct-to-dvd movie starring an overweight Steven Seagal teamed up with Whoopi Goldberg in a buddycop/coming of age dramedy.

Of course that is a huge thing! The thing is, SR simply cannot be around forever, what if DPR spontaneously combusted. Anyway no matter how dedicated DPR is and has been, doesn&#039;t change the fact that the future is unwritten and he will have to shut down operations at one time or another, so let&#039;s just enjoy the time we have. Once Atlantis get&#039;s going, which it looks like they have been slowly but surely I see no extra risks there than here. Nobody should be trusting DPR with their money or information anyway! I believe DPR himself would tell you this! Do your business with the system provided and don&#039;t just leave your money sitting like an idiot! It is more likely that DPR would give everyone warning if he knew he had to shut down but he may not be able to! So minimize your risk and do your thing.

If more people came here and thoroughly researched their vendors each and every time they are planning an order there would be a lot less scamming going on. I still am amazed at how some of the large FE scams manage to rip so many people when one look at the vendors feedback and a quick search on here can often alert you to there being an issue quite early on, the red flags are there!<br />
