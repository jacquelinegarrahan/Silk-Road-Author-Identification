				I&#039;m with aussiepp....<br /><br />SR isn&#039;t perfect but its the horse I&#039;m backing for the foreseeable future. Frankly I believe there is a better than average chance that Atlantis is a massive sting op by one of the LE agencies out there. Too polished, too complete and too much word for word plagiarism of the terms and conditions etc.. The &quot;manual&#039; verified vendors thast where in place from launch made me think that even if the site isn&#039;t LE then there is a flaw in security with these &#039;legacy&#039; vendors being manually verified.. Just too easy for a switched on LEO to use this as a way in IMO.. Perhaps even the sites name... The paradise that sunk into the ocean nver to be seen again and taking every one of its citizens with it... <br /><br />I would be interested to know which vendors are on there from here so I know to avoid them here in the future... may seem over the top but I actually think that its a sign of disloyalty and poor judgment to be on both or all three as a vendor... not to mention the fact that the odds of at least one of the three being a sting or a compromised site or hell even just the target when LE has its hand forced by public pressure and an operation is undertaken on one of them.. that&#039;s if its not already underway.. Being the way it/they are it will be the weaker/soft target they go after to ensure fast results and sensational media coverage... <br /><br />SR, IMO, will not be the first target. Sure it would be a high valur target given its exposure in the media however with all the security and the focused effort to educate the masses on how be safe and anonymous it would be difficult to gather enough evidence/prosecutions to justify the expense such an op would require.. Its a numbers game after all and so the derp selling weed and molly from a house in the suburbs or the kids driving round smoking blunts are much more attractive victims.After them it would be the site that doesn&#039;t use Encryption and uses a currency so new its only available from a handful of places. Think about that one.... its too late to control BTC but not litecoins. From my understanding money can be used as an aggravating factor by prosecutors to upgrade charges to traffic... but with these new currencies its not like finding a bank roll on some OG when you nab em with some rock in little baggies o the streets so you need the trail... <br /><br />I could go on...<br /><br />One thing though OP...<br /><br />May I ask why for you put a link that&#039;s a tor2web??? isn&#039;t that like a bad idea and a massive security issue? In fact... that&#039;s a odd thing really isn&#039;t it.... why would you have that link to post in the first place? is it what you use to access the site or what? like yoiu either cut and past what you use or took the normal onion and made it a web2tor link as a purposful act... either way mate... its not good. Can you change the OP please? Also if your using that link and are not LE and want to stay a free person I&#039;d stop and get the onion to use..<br /><br />Stay safe people... Its a jungle out there!<br /><br />EDIT: I could go on and did apparently so tyook a long time writing the post... anyway<br /><br />correct link for those interested is;<br /><br />[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion<br /><br />and the thread with the intro from the site ops of Atlantis is;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137273

				Sure have.<br /><br />I probably signed up for it two, maybe three weeks ago.<br /><br />I did it because:<br /><br />A) I love SR. This will keep SR vendors &quot;honest&quot;.<br /><br />B) They are using LTC. Looks like a potential investment opportunity<br /><br />and<br /><br />C)You can never be getting your drugs from too many places.<br /><br />I mean I see it like this: cryptocurrency and selling drugs, &quot;safely&quot;, online is BRAND SPANKING NEW!<br /><br />When did you know of something being a great opportunity, and staying that way, but there was only one real player in the game.<br /><br />That is not happening in a capitalistic market, especially in the underworld.

				I have made a few purchases at BMR. Most have gone well. Three were scam/sketch/LEO/whoknows, but I always stayed in escrow and every time BMR gave me a 100% refund, quickly with no issues. Their admin dude is active on the forums and very responsive to bug complaints and requests and the like, from what I have seen.<br /><br />You guys who signed up or logged in through .to, had better change ALL your similar username/password combos, everywhere. No joke. There&#039;s a nontrivial chance somebody was listening in on you, watching what you do on SR and meaning you harm.<br /><br />Everybody else, keep in mind the golden rule of never reusing your passwords. True on the Internet in general, even more true on illegal underground drug markets. If you used the same username and password there (or anywhere else) as you do here, you&#039;d better change ALL your similar passwords across all websites.<br /><br />PSA. Be real, real, careful everybody. No joke.

				After looking through this Atlantis site, it&#039;s pretty awesome! It&#039;s like they bought some LSD from SR, got creative, and made numerous improvements to SR. I like it! Went ahead and made my account and poked around. If SR started migrating over (which I wouldn&#039;t be upset if so) then I&#039;ll already be set up. <br />There are some prices on domestic MDMA over there that look borderline too good to be true. So when it&#039;s established a little more, I&#039;ll definitely be checking it out.<br /><br />-PS

				Good point. When sr is down how else can we buy shit?<br /><br />Thank god for these alternate sites when sr is down ( frequently ). If you notice, those other sites are never down.&nbsp; They even have mirror addresses too,&nbsp; they got it going on. <br /><br />Im quite certain a Silk Road staff or old time vendor is the consultant behind those sites. <br />

				Looks like a pretty nice site and forum with good potential. Hopefully it will build a decent community that can compete with SR. I love SR, and am not at all bitter about the fact that feature requests tend to go answered for long periods of time. I think the competition will be good if anything (and I don&#039;t have nearly as much reverence for competitive forces as DPR and most of the user base here), more vendors and more customers is a good thing. The more people sending drugs in the mail the more absurd the proposal of trying to stop it becomes.

				Atlantis takes LTC - If you got an AMD card; you can probably get .5-1.5 LTC a day. <br /><br />Get on it people, if MtGox takes LTC then the LTC that you just mined for the cost of power is going to go from 2.5$ per to 15+ very quickly. <br /><br />Drugs.... Think of the drugs would you!!!<br /><br />Edit: But do not drop your proverbial shield. IF you have doubts or concerns that this is a LE Honeypot, I would not discount that feeling as just paranoia. <br /><br />Here is the origin of the &quot;creator&quot; <br />http://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,1370.0.html (http://forum.litecoin.net/index.php/topic,1370.0.html)<br /><br />First thing that noticed to me was it was an 8 post, no capitalized (but very concise post) - Judge a OP by his cover can sometimes save you. But what I got out of it, was maybe he was a miner/early investor and noticed that the business model of SR has really made BTC valuable and not to mention DPR probably well off.

				I really want to test this site out, but I am skeptical.

Frankly I believe there is a better than average chance that Atlantis is a massive sting op by one of the LE agencies out there. Too polished, too complete and too much word for word plagiarism of the terms and conditions etc.. The &quot;manual&#039; verified vendors thast where in place from launch made me think that even if the site isn&#039;t LE then there is a flaw in security with these &#039;legacy&#039; vendors being manually verified.. Just too easy for a switched on LEO to use this as a way in IMO.. Perhaps even the sites name... The paradise that sunk into the ocean nver to be seen again and taking every one of its citizens with it... <br /><br />I would be interested to know which vendors are on there from here so I know to avoid them here in the future... may seem over the top but I actually think that its a sign of disloyalty and poor judgment to be on both or all three as a vendor... not to mention the fact that the odds of at least one of the three being a sting or a compromised site or hell even just the target when LE has its hand forced by public pressure and an operation is undertaken on one of them.. that&#039;s if its not already underway.. Being the way it/they are it will be the weaker/soft target they go after to ensure fast results and sensational media coverage... <br /><br />SR, IMO, will not be the first target. Sure it would be a high valur target given its exposure in the media however with all the security and the focused effort to educate the masses on how be safe and anonymous it would be difficult to gather enough evidence/prosecutions to justify the expense such an op would require.. Its a numbers game after all and so the derp selling weed and molly from a house in the suburbs or the kids driving round smoking blunts are much more attractive victims.After them it would be the site that doesn&#039;t use Encryption and uses a currency so new its only available from a handful of places. Think about that one.... its too late to control BTC but not litecoins. From my understanding money can be used as an aggravating factor by prosecutors to upgrade charges to traffic... but with these new currencies its not like finding a bank roll on some OG when you nab em with some rock in little baggies o the streets so you need the trail... <br /><br />I could go on...<br /><br />One thing though OP...<br /><br />May I ask why for you put a link that&#039;s a tor2web??? isn&#039;t that like a bad idea and a massive security issue? In fact... that&#039;s a odd thing really isn&#039;t it.... why would you have that link to post in the first place? is it what you use to access the site or what? like yoiu either cut and past what you use or took the normal onion and made it a web2tor link as a purposful act... either way mate... its not good. Can you change the OP please? Also if your using that link and are not LE and want to stay a free person I&#039;d stop and get the onion to use..<br /><br />Stay safe people... Its a jungle out there!<br /><br />EDIT: I could go on and did apparently so tyook a long time writing the post... anyway<br /><br />correct link for those interested is;<br /><br />[CENSORED: scam link]rky4es5q.onion<br /><br />and the thread with the intro from the site ops of Atlantis is;<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=137273<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />First off iv been here right at a year bro, and the last thing i am is LE...

As for advertising it, That was not my intention at all, Nor was posting something with web2tor or whatever if it was anyharm, it was just passed on to me that way and that is why i came to the community to ask, BMR is brought here off and on, the main reason i asked the community about it is because it looks just like the SR.. <br /><br />Anyways Sorry i came off like a smart ass, Im man enough to say i apologize if i went about something the wrong way, the main thing was just the accusation of being LE. Anyway on to new things no hard feeling man.. Nice Psychology you spoke of in your first few sentences btw..Very clever.&nbsp; :P

				Is it just me or is there no reputation / rating system for the vendors?<br /><br />Edit: Apparently there is a feedback system but it&#039;s not immediately apparent.&nbsp; They have some improvements they&#039;ll have to do if they want to take market share away from Silk Road.&nbsp; Competition is good and will help push both websites to improve their services.

				Looks like one or more LTC early adopters wants to pump the LTC exchange price up with drug sales. Great idea! That will help separate LTC from the pack of other crypto currencies, and hopefully I can get a miner running today and get some LTC before the price starts to take off :)<br /><br />Also, for everyone commenting on prices, keep this in mind:<br /><br />The vendor account price is low, low enough that scammers could buy a dozen or more vendor accounts for less than the price of 1 SR account.<br /><br />Any scammer can copy &amp; paste a leading SR vendors pictures and descriptions over to Atlantis (heck, even username in some cases).<br /><br />Legit vendors will likely sell for the same price (or nearly the same price) on both sites. <br /><br />Scam vendors will offer heavy discounts on items to get people to shut off their brains and FE<br /><br />If someone claims to be a legit SR vendor on Atlantis, message the vendor on SR (not Atlantis) to verify identity.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what the escrow is like at Atlantis, but ~~~NEVER FINALIZE UNTIL DRUGS ARE IN YOUR HANDS~~~

V1lad1m1r has been back on the Silk Road for a while now. Lol............. ::) That&#039;s been common knowledge for some time. Didn&#039;t you see his recent posts on forums? But yes, you are correct, he was an old btc vendor here last year that went off after people FE&#039;d. But he is back again. You knew that though, I assume. And it is good to see someone follow history here, too. That was ages ago, last year in fact, and people still remember.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

I also started selling there, and honestly was not expecting such a great reaction. I have 30+ orders sent out, and so far no scammers and everyone has left 5/5 feedback and released funds from escrow as soon as there package lands. Its worth at least checking out I would say...

				ive said time and time again im a true sr fan! its the holy grail!!<br />however i do like the feature they have where you create one acct and <br />can buy or sell without actually having to be a vendor.(just want to move some<br />extra you had around) but on the other side i guess it would be slightly harder <br />to gauge scamming.idk
