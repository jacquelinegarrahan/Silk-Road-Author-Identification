				So I finally got back into town today,&nbsp; (Transmission exploded, got stuck in the hospital, overall pretty spectacular week&nbsp; ::) )&nbsp; and my (partner, associate, is there a politically correct name that D.A.R.E. has assigned to a drug tag-team member?)&nbsp; let me know that one of the people he dealt with decided it would be cute to slip a couple of counterfeit 100s into the cash he gave us.&nbsp; Which isn&#039;t actually so cute because right now I have mechanics/doctors/tow truck companies/insurance agents to pay.&nbsp; Needless to say, the kid won&#039;t return contact or willingly pay up the money he owes,&nbsp; so I was wondering, put in my position, what course of action would YOU take? <br />Bonus points for creativity&nbsp; ;)

				Heres the thing... Those bills are illegal to even have. if u get caught with them its federal time...&nbsp; I had some kids give me some fake bills from a craigslist deal. We went to turn them in and the cops questioned US like we were to blame. So burn them. you cant do anything about the bills... now if you want to and you knwo where this guy is, you could turn the bills in and pioint them in the right direction but no one wants to deal with LE. So I would get some shit kickers, break his legs, and bury him in a field for a day or two. Dig his ass up and then see what he has to say.

				Yeah, I got rid of the bills already.&nbsp; Your idea was pretty close to mine lol, figure if nothing else, it&#039;ll take out some of the broken vehicle frustrations. xD
