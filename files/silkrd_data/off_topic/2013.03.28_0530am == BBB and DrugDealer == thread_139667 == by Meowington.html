				Well, I have never thought of that one... But through my experience... if I&#039;m tripping hardcore I can&#039;t find myself to type a sentence correctly.

				yeah maybe, just possibly, drugs might have something to do with it lol. i kinda think he&#039;s masterblaster too but he&#039;s accused me of being masterblaster for some reason :-\ it does seem weird how his creations hate each other. what a headfuck. oh well he&#039;s off having a nice holiday now. or part of him is. i don&#039;t know how that works.
