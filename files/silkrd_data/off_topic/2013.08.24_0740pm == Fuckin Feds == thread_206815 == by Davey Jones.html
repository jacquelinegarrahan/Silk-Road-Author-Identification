				Typical fed bullshit going on.&nbsp; They&#039;re going after bitinstant and mt gox.&nbsp; One report I read that they seized several million from mt gox.&nbsp; When they can&#039;t get to things at transaction level, they go after the assets.&nbsp; That is textbook fed shit.&nbsp; They couldn&#039;t get a buddy of mine, so they eventually went after his property saying he had unreported income to own so much and the IRS got him and seized his property.&nbsp; Granted, he was known for doing what he did and it probably ticked off local le that they couldn&#039;t get him.

				And as the feds seize more BTC, How are those Bitcoins going to get back into circulation? The more they remove from the pool, the more valuable BTC gets right? Because they&#039;re removing from a limited supply?
