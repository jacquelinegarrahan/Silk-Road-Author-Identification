				This article was written 2 years ago...<br /><br />I believe your buddy is not bullshittin dude.<br />Just a few weeks ago, BofA , Wells Fargo, and chase all built branches in Iraq.&nbsp; Why the hell on earth would they do that?&nbsp; <br /><br />Cuz they are going to be exchanging Dinars for US dollar and start exchanging the currency in Iraq. <br /><br />Iraq just got out of chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the UN is pressuring them to hit the button or else they will put them back into bankruptcy.<br /><br />Also, they have so many valuable commodities like gold and oil that the entire world needs/wants... They can pretty much do whatever they want.<br /><br />And that link says its a scam? How&#039;s that? Since its a tangible currency.. Worst comes to worst you can always sell it on eBay or another dinar site and lose out on $20 maybe $40?&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s so worth the millions you can make from just $250-$500 investment.&nbsp; I&#039;d say you invest before its too late.<br /><br />Go to dinarguru.com and read the latest news.&nbsp; Make sure you google whatever you read though, to validate its true.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some people are saying any day now to maybe the first of the year.&nbsp; All I know is once it does hit,<br />I&#039;m gonna be laughing all the way to the bank. :o

				Iraq has over a 130 billion USD of debt.&nbsp; Their bank only exchanges in the thousands range of dinar over there.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />On the other hand, it would make some cheap and interesting wallpaper.
