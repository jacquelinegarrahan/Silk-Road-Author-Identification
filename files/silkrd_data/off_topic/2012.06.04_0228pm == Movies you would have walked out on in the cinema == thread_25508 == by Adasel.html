				Yeah thats right.<br />I just sat through Star Trek The motion picture.&nbsp; I totally forgot how long and boring it was.&nbsp; Sometimes when you start watching a movie you just feel &quot;obligated&quot; to finish it.<br />Anyone else had similar experiences?

Haha I got about 20 minutes into that, and gave up.<br /><br />Movies I have actually walked out on?<br /><br />Pirates of the caribbean 4 was an absolute piece of shit. The first was decent, the second was novel, the third was a parody of itself, and the fourth was just Johnny Depp pretending to be drunk, and Kiera Knightly putting on a bitch face. Seen it all before a million times. I want to see some new shit when I go to the cinema, not just rehashing of concepts that they know will earn them money/establish their brand.

				I fell asleep watching the 3 Musketeers (1993) - Never walked out of cinema (I&#039;m too much of a cheapskate) - And I must say, I&#039;m pretty hungover/binged out from a binge last night so Star Trek was just the ticket for me!

				That&#039;s honestly why I pirate most of my shit. If it&#039;s a good movie I won&#039;t hesitate to go see it again, but shit if I spent the money to see all the shitty movies I&#039;ve downloaded in just the past 5 years I would be insanely pissed off.<br /><br />The Dictator was the last movie I couldn&#039;t even finish watching, problem was I knew it would be a piece of shit but the trailer looked somewhat funny. Battleship I finished but that was only because I was too high to bother finding something else, if I was at the theater I probably would have left and hung out at the arcade playing Tekken or something more entertaining til it was over. Abraham Lincoln: More Vampire Shit looks like one I would probably walk out of too, that movie makes me think they&#039;ve completely run out of ideas.

				@Kappucino<br />The fact that i was sitting at home and drinking probably helped me get through Star Trek.&nbsp; But yeah i can totally understand why you only watched 20 mins or so.<br /><br />Also yes, the fourth POTC movie was utterly shite.&nbsp; I guess i am at the age now where, if i start watching something, i have to finish it.&nbsp; However believe it or not, they left the fourth pirates movie open FOR ANOTHER SEQUEL!!!<br /><br />I wont give any spoilers away unless your interested, but my gut feelings tell me you lost all interest lol.

It&#039;d be like watching Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King without seeing the first two.

Crank would be one I wouldn&#039;t have walked out on but I would be disappointed that I spent money on popcorn to sit through it, let alone the tickets.<br /><br />And yea The Professional was Leon, great movie. The Jackal is my favorite Bruce Willis movie, and The American is Bruce Willis. For much of the movie it&#039;s pretty slow going but lends itself to being more realistic that way as well. I haven&#039;t seen The Replacement Killers, I&#039;ll check it out.

I mentioned in an above post that I couldn&#039;t even watch half of the Dictator. I also thought the Avengers was bad, but I&#039;m also not a comic book fan at all and so I generally don&#039;t love the comic book movies as much as everyone else. I know someone will hate me for it, but I didn&#039;t like Transformers either and I loved the show as a kid. Story was just bland, acting was sub par, and I seem to be the only one that didn&#039;t like the movie let alone love it and beg for every crumb of trailer footage to the sequel.

I always heard about how great this movie was etc so I broke down and watched it one time and sat there for an hour waiting for the movie to start, feeling like I was watching all the fluff they cut out during editing of the actual movie. Might be enjoyable tripping, will have to remember that one.

How would that be a horror? Lol.<br /><br />Haven&#039;t heard of Bad Taste, Peter Jackson low budget sounds like an oxymoron lol.<br /><br />As for unknown gems, that&#039;s a little difficult since many end up becoming cult classics, so not unknown anymore. Here&#039;s some that I can think of that were great movies despite not doing much in the box office (iirc), obviously people have seen a lot of these but my guess would be they liked it if they&#039;ve seen it.<br /><br />The Killer Inside Me (Casey Affleck whose amazing in it, and Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba who are hot as always)<br />One Hour Photo (Robin Williams plays a psycho, not a fan of his comedy but this movie proved to me he can actually act)<br />Primer<br />Boiler Room<br />Gattaca (All around superb acting)<br />Donnie Darko (One of my all time favs)<br />Mallrats (Classic, if you like it then check out Clerks too)<br />Rounders (If you like poker, this movies awesome)<br />Green Street Hooligans (Yea it&#039;s Frodo, but he gets the shit kicked out of him, if you like it then also check out Football Factory)<br />A Scanner Darkly (Watch a clip of it at least)<br /><br />Now if you&#039;re talking independent films, I can list my favorites for that too but I find with independents people generally love them or hate them, the above list I would imagine 90% of the people who see them would like them.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The &#039;Black Sheep&#039; Im thinking of doesnt have Farley in it.&nbsp; This one is about mutant killer sheep.&nbsp; <br /><br />Rounders, Donnie Darko (and Donnie brasko come to think of it) and The Killer Inside Me are on the list already, just aint got round to watching them yet.&nbsp; Theres a few on the list Ive never heard of - primer and boiler room that I&#039;ll have to check out, thanks. One Hour Photo Ive never managed to see all the way through, but the bits Ive saw are good.&nbsp; Theres another straight role Ive saw him do - think its &#039;Insomnia&#039; with Al Pacino.&nbsp; Mallrats and Clerks I checked out recently, both very funny, also liked Dogma from him.&nbsp; Green Street is one of the best footy ones going, Im near certain Ive mentioned the others on another thread......just a little hard to take Frodo playing a football hooligan, doesnt even look like he should be allowed out after dark.<br /><br />*MODIFIED*&nbsp; rotten tomatoes - hall pass 34% change up 25% looks like its Hall Pass<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Boiler Room is probably more well known, it had big names in it, starred Giovanni Ribisi (had to IMDB that one) and Vin Diesel ... not a Vin fan at all, but the movies still good. Basically Giovanni plays a guy that used to have casino games run in his house for college students but it goes bad and he gets a job at a cutthroat brokering agency that doesn&#039;t a lot of shady shit.<br /><br />Primer is pretty slow paced but an excellent movie and storyline, I won&#039;t even tell you what it&#039;s about because it would ruin it. It&#039;s one of those movies that puts you in the dark and then builds the pieces from there to fill you in.<br /><br />If your girl is anything like mine, do not watch Primer with her or you&#039;ll end up with, &quot;What is that? What are they doing?&quot; - Then I gotta be the asshole and tell her to please shut the fuck up, I&#039;m watching the exact same movie as you, I don&#039;t have a damn script in front of me, they aren&#039;t telling you yet for a reason.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dont like Ribissi.&nbsp; I mean who in their right mind would leave Scarlett Johannsen alone all day in a hotel room (Lost in Translation)&nbsp; :D&nbsp; Sounds a little bit like One for the money - Al pacino, Matthew mcConnaughey?<br /><br />With primer is there anything in it I could even remotely dress up to sell it as a chick flick?&nbsp; Mind you, its my turn - I had to endure Bridesmaids last week.<br /><br />Incidentally, I hope for your sake your girl is nothing like mine&nbsp; :-\<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t really like Ribissi that much either, he&#039;s pretty stale, but he was good in Boiler Room. I&#039;ve never seen One for the Money so can&#039;t compare, Boiler Room would sort of be similar to Wall Street 2 I suppose?<br /><br />Primer is not a chick flick at all, well not a guy flick either, sort of a down to earth drama with a tinge of sci fi? Hard to categorize that movie, computer enthusiasts and other techies are probably the main audience, not that anyone else wouldn&#039;t enjoy it.<br /><br />Next time it&#039;s her turn to pick, try to get her to choose Midnight in Paris, I thought that was a great film, my favorite Woody Allen movie now.

				I also downloaded Area 407 and all I got to say is: please don&#039;t make the same mistake.<br />&nbsp;it&#039;s like blair witch, meets one of those cheesy ed wood style of films (you know, the kind where you can see the zipper on the monsters suit, etc...). this is one of those films that, if i got a notice from my ISP for downloading it, I would a demand a refund for my wasted bandwidth. it is seriously that bad. <br /><br />As far as underground trippy movies goes. check out &quot;dark side of the rainbow&quot;. hands down the best movie to get twisted with.

Titanic and Romeo and Juliet I can say I did not like at all, but he made so much money off Titanic it&#039;s not like I can fault him for taking the script.<br /><br />Blood Diamond I thought was awful, and I&#039;m not alone on that one, I don&#039;t know what the point of giving him a piss poor South African accent is but other than that he was good in it but the script was terrible.<br /><br />Inception was more of a &#039;look at a the special effects we can do!&#039; movie, which are all horrible, story was laughable at best. He was a good actor in it as always, but again in my opinion the script was weak.<br /><br />Shutter Island was terrible, I don&#039;t know why he decided to do that one.<br /><br />J Edgar is another script he should not have taken, boring movie and he&#039;s a horrible J. Edgar Hoover. The Aviator and Gangs of New York, both weak scripts and below average movies.<br /><br />The Departed is a great movie all around, I&#039;m really looking forward to The Great Gatsby, and Catch Me If You Can was good.<br /><br />And on Nicolas Cage, I agree I like The Rock, Con Air and Face Off, but I would have probably loved them if he wasn&#039;t in them, he did play a decent bad guy in Face Off but he overdid it a lot with his over the top mannerisms they must have taught him in that acting class he took in Jr High.

I only went to see the first one and in my defense it was with my cousin! Not my idea, but we ended up walking out. I&#039;ve never seen acting as terrible in all my life... not only that but films that focus on &#039;love&#039; in general are no goes for me. Why? Because a shit load of teenagers say shit like &#039;I love you and I can&#039;t imagine my life without you, I don&#039;t know where you&#039;ve been all this time&#039;. The movies actually convince them that they could be madly in love at that age.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I too have had the unfortunate experience of watching Twilight.&nbsp; Wife read the books before the movies where mentioned, made me watch the first one when it came out.&nbsp; I was just constantly ripping on it the whole time and she never made me watch the sequels because the acting, cinematography, direction was just so bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />Films usually have an element of love and lot of times it is a fairly large focus in all films.&nbsp; Try to think of films that don&#039;t have a focus on love in one way or another.&nbsp; I think I can name one or two.&nbsp; Last Action Hero being the only one I can think of off the top of my head.&nbsp; I think your thinking of the romance genre and I try my best to steer clear of them as well but being one that lives with the opposite sex sometimes I am forced to endure them from time to time.&nbsp; <br /><br />On another note related to Twilight, Stephanie Meyer who wrote them actually wrote an adult book called The Host which actually was pretty good if you ever get a chance to read it.&nbsp;

I wondered which came first now that you mentioned it, seems first mention of the movie was the director quoted in a Variety magazine article in 2008, Entourage episode aired mid 2009. I think Leonardo is a great actor, it&#039;s just his movies that let me down more than him, which is something I can&#039;t say I feel about any other actor, which is why I assume he just chooses bad scripts. I want The Great Gatsby to be good since I love the book, but there are people on IMDB forum already criticizing him being cast in that role. You could be right and it&#039;s another Aviator...

				@Konomo<br /><br />Have to agree there bro.&nbsp; Captain America was pure fucking horrific movie making, at its worst.&nbsp; It seemed like the whole movie was just set for the character to wake up in the 21st century to be a part of the avengers.&nbsp; But what a way to go about it.<br />Lame acting, lame script and poor cinematography.<br /><br />And meister, i am so surprised that you slated Inception dude.&nbsp; Of course we all have our opinions here, but Christopher Nolan struck gold with his idea of shared dreaming.&nbsp; His remake of the batman movies etc.&nbsp; Okay if you want to nit pick it may no thave been the best choice to cast DiCaprio in the picture, but he did a hell of a job with what he had to work with.<br /><br />I kinda feel sorry for DiCaprio.&nbsp; People still have this image of him being every teenage girls lust fantasy in movies like Romeo and Juliet.&nbsp; Surely, you cannot deny the guy has grown up, and his choice of movies has shown that.

				I&#039;m not denying anything, as I said I think he&#039;s a great actor and I loved The Departed and Catch Me If You Can, all I was pointing out is that for such a great actor that can cherry pick blockbuster after blockbuster, he picks some really weak movie scripts to pursue.<br /><br />Inception I&#039;ll leave you with, I personally didn&#039;t like it, I think Leonardo was good in it but I thought they could have done a hell of a lot more with the story premise than they did, and I didn&#039;t like the choice of any of the supporting actors. That&#039;s just my taste.<br /><br />But with movies like J Edgar, Aviator, Blood Diamond, Shutter Island, Gangs of New York, and Revolutionary Road, I&#039;m just saying his acting talents are being wasted on movies like these.<br /><br />Think this all began when I was saying I thought Nicolas Cage was a horrible actor that lands himself in good movies, where Leonardo is a great actor that lands himself in poor movies.

				Will Ferrell is more hit than miss at least, one of my favorite roles of his was the Rick Flair looking car dealership owner in Eastbound &amp; Down, laughed my ass off at him in that, he was a producer on that show as well.<br /><br />Happy Gilmore I can still watch and laugh at, but Waterboy and especially Billy Madison I used to really like as a teenager but a while back Billy Madison was on TV I guess I&#039;ve outgrown it, I didn&#039;t think it was funny at all anymore.<br /><br />But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s harsh in saying I&#039;d rather Chris Farley to still be around than Adam Sandler after I had to sit through the piles of shit called 50 First Dates and You Don&#039;t Mess With The Zohan.<br /><br />I can still literally make myself laugh by just remembering the Chris Farley SNL skit where he was a chippendale dancer with Patrick Swayze. Only skit I find funnier than that one is Canteen Boy with Alec Baldwin, which Adam Sandler almost ruined because he couldn&#039;t stop laughing, luckily Alec is a pro.

				Haha Ferrel is hilarious in that role. I gotta catch up, I haven&#039;t watched season 3 yet since I switched over to showtime for Californication and now I&#039;m back on HBO.&nbsp; I love using cable providers by switching back and forth between movie packages as they run promotions (sign up for HBO and get 6 months of it for free) and then cancel it once the promo is over and get a different one.<br /><br />It would be nice to have Farley back but I think what made him so funny was the drugs he was abusing.&nbsp; A parallel I draw is like all great musicians only making good music when they are on hard drugs.&nbsp; They die and become legends or sober up and make shitty music/movies.<br /><br />Anyway, that skit with Farley is a classic how can you forget it?&nbsp; His motivational speaker Matt Foley skit was also pretty damn funny.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also liked Eddie Murphy&#039;s Mr. Robinsons neighborhood skit if you want to go back even further.

				Lol I used to impersonate his Matt Foley character all the time in high school. IIRC Farrell doesn&#039;t make an appearance in EB&amp;D again til maybe the last season? It&#039;s worth it though, he&#039;s at his southern plantation home and wearing a little ribbon bow tie thing and looks like KFC&#039;s Colonel Sanders lol.<br /><br />Like you, I can&#039;t wait for Anchorman 2, Christina Applegate signed on as well. Talk about lucky, her role in the first one reinvigorated her career like nothing else could have.
