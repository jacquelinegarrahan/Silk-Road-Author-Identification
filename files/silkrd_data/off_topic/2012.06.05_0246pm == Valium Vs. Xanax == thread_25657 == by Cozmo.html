				Ok guys, i&#039;m wondering here, i know the differences between the two, and definitely prefer xanax. Hands down. I prefer Xanax.<br />But there seems to be a large market for valium, larger than i expected in Australia. Can someone tell me why people enjoy Valium more than Xanax? <br />Can i get every ones opinion on the two? And why do you like one better than the other? Also i&#039;m enjoying alprazolam intensol immensely the liquid is awesome. So could i get everyone opinion on xanax and valium please?

				Valium sounds like a flower, while Xanax has 2(!!!) X&#039;s in it so it&#039;s chemical and also sounds like Antrax which is of course very lethal..<br />

But daily use dude, not a good idea. <br />Trust me bro, benzo withdrawals are complete hell. But I guess you know that. <br /><br />For me alcohol and benzos are somewhat in the same category, some heavy drinkers seem to be able to switch to benzos and vice versa. Although benzos still have a legit use, the help to get you down and to sleep when everything else fails. Alcohol on the other hand has no legit use, besides disinfecting your face after some drunk dude beat the shit out of you :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />One thing Alcohol and Benzos have in common is they the only 2 drugs that you can die from withdrawls.

Again Clonazepam is supposed to be the best for social anxiety.<br /><br />I know I am on a drug forum and I don&#039;t want to sound preachy, but please be careful especially with everyday use. With Heroin and Meth you kinda know what you get yourself into and that those are very addictive drugs. Benzos on the other hand are given out by Psychiatrists like candy wiith maybe a warning that they &quot;might be addictive&quot;. That&#039;s just plain wrong, use &#039;em daily and you *will* get addicted and withdrawals are really unpleasant.<br /><br />I was told that some long-time using older people (like 50+) decided, together with their doctors, to stay on benzos indefinitely, because getting off would be too hard. <br />Don&#039;t wanna scare anyone, but if I can safe 1 dude from going through haevy withdrawals, it&#039;s worth it. <br /><br />Beware of the psychiatrists, get real drugs!&nbsp; 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If I could hit the Karma button 10 times for you I would, Because what you said is sooooo true. Benzos can be extremely addictive unfortunately DR&#039;s over prescribe them, Most of the DR that prescribe Benzos are not qualified to prescribe them. almost any GP will write scripts for Xanax. I always got my xanax from a family DR (5 years) You can&#039;t cold Turkey Benzos either because you can die from it, This is not an exaggeration. Today in America the most dangerous are not the street drugs but the prescription drugs. I live in the SouthEast we have pain management clinics AKA Pill Mills that are handing out Opiate and Benzo prescriptions to the tune of 180 Benzos per month and well over 250 Opiates per month. <br /><br />

				The advantage of Xanax I thought was it was more powerful, but on the other hand very short acting.<br /><br />I prefer valium becuase I think it just feels better and last longer, but I havent dont that much xnanx to be honest. I had major addiction to valium and will only take it in very small doses when absolutely needed now.<br /><br />Like others said be very careful, tolerance builds very quickly and so dose the addiction.

				<br />I prefer Xanax too. I&#039;m also befuddled as to why there is such a high demand for Valium. The ratio is around 10:1!<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve read and understand, Valium has a longer half life (~100hours) which means your liver has a way harder time to break down this chemical. Xanax has a shorter half life (~12hours) and so can not only clear your system quicker for re-dosage but it also alleviates the work done on your liver. <br /><br />Valium is poison in terms of recreational use. It stays in your system too long. I bought 100 as they were so cheap and plentiful and because it was my first introduction to Benzos. I used around 10 and chucked away the rest after doing some research.<br /><br />I have ordered some Ambien (Zolpidem) as it has a half life of like 3 hours! It also kicks in pretty fast, around 15mins but I&#039;m not sure it will have the same knock out effect like Xanax though.

				I like Valiums for the longer lasting effect, use them for sleep, shitty comedowns and I feel panic when I&#039;m in a crowd so sometimes use them for situations like that. They have virtually no recreational value for me tho.<br /><br />If I have anything that&#039;s really gonna stress me out I have a Mogadon at bedtime; I wake up feeling super relaxed like I&#039;ve had the best sleep on ever, nice relaxed muscles. Then pop a Valium at breakfast time... <br /><br />If I had a job interview that day I&#039;d probably go in there and high five the panel before kicking my feet up on the desk and telling them to bring it on.
