				Am I mistaken or was there not a recent thread started which explained the differences between Cocaine, Speed and Amphetamines?&nbsp; It may not have been on this board but I thought it was.&nbsp; If you know where it is could you please post if for me? <br /><br />I recently tried snorting some paste and it sucked.&nbsp; Snorted some more and some more and some more and it just didnt really do shit.&nbsp; There was a little rush and a kind of like a little tease where it felt like some euphoria was taunting me&nbsp; saying come and get me and then it was gone.&nbsp; Anyway that one sucked,&nbsp; won&#039;t order again.<br /><br />I am trying to get two things accomplished.&nbsp; Find some damn good cocaine and give it a rip.&nbsp; For once in my life I want to see what the fuss is about.&nbsp; Every blasted time I had it everyone said, shoot hal you should been with us last time, this is nothing compared to what we had before.<br /><br />The second thing is I want to accomplish is a seperate drug for a seperate need.&nbsp; I need an amphetamine like substance to use not abuse on occasion during the work day.&nbsp; I have heard Ritalin, Adderal might be good suggestions?&nbsp; I want to be full of energy with good manual dexterity but my mind must be crystal clear.&nbsp; I do not want or need europhia with this drug but it must put me and maintain me in a pleasent mood and able to interract with others without being obvious that I am on somehting.<br /><br />Any suggestions?&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) is exactly what you&#039;re looking for. For me, there is no euphoria, just an &quot;up&quot; feeling. No over talkativeness or OCD like activity like with adderall, just mental clarity. You&#039;re very on point about everything. Makes you feel very robot-ish though, which kinda kills your personality after awhile.

				Most of the coke that I&#039;ve seen has been pretty shitty.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t like it much at all; my throat closes up and my stomach feels sick just from a small line.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would agree dexedrine is the best amphetamine&nbsp; Very clean/smooth although if you use high doses for days it can be as jittery as anything else.&nbsp;

				I had some Adderall IR. Told my doc I think I&#039;m adhd and the doc said, here try this. Nice doc :)<br /><br />Anyway, I thought the up was good but as somebody mentioned there is a bit of OCD activity that goes with it. Though I was really focused I found that sometimes I focused on things that were a bit off my target goal, I&#039;d get caught up reading some material and 2 hours would have passed. Normally I could just browse right through this stuff but that the adderall effect. I&#039;d love to give the dex a try but I don&#039;t want to push it with the doctor. But if you get anything look for that. All good from what I hear.<br /><br />You know there is legal (with a prescription) meth too? I don&#039;t know how the effects compare to what you&#039;re seeking. It&#039;s called Desoxyn, they prescribe this for adhd too.
