				Was wondering if anyone knew of any drugs that aid in a meditation practice? I have, in particular, a &quot;monkey mind&quot; meaning my brain goes from thought to thought and it&#039;s difficult to focus. <br /><br />Does anyone know of something good to buy that helps with meditation?

				a 100mg line of ketamine should slow your mind sufficiently and disconnect you from the distractions of the physical world...plus it&#039;s very introspective...

				i used to have back issues, so i tried yoga for a bit.&nbsp; One time i did it after taking a percocet and it was great!&nbsp; I have tried meditation on and off over the last 7 years, and i tried that with percs and it made it much more enjoyable.&nbsp; To be honest though, i enjoy pretty much everything a lot more when i&#039;m on percs haha so i don&#039;t know how helpful my post is.<br /><br />You could try benadryl, it&#039;ll make you sleepy but i think it will calm you down enough.

				Shrooms!!!<br /><br />Studies have shown that they lower blood flow in your brain in certain areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex. This is a major area that you use every day it is concerned with how you think rationally mostly. Its why people are able to look at their life with an unbiased view because they are now using other parts of their brain when they think.

				One of the teaching principles of meditation is that you will have thoughts, always - especially during a state of meditation. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;mental chatter&quot;. In a perfect simulation, you are supposed to recognize these thoughts, acknowledge their existence, but not engage within the train of thought. <br /><br />The visual used to describe the process is you have bubbles (they are an idea or thoughts that have their own paths filled with twist and turns and mental landscapes for you to become traveled and lost in) floating around your head and one will appear directly within your field of conscious (in front of eyes) -- to acknowledge this thought bubble exists and give it a visual presence is to allow yourself to not engage inward. Eventually the bubble will move on or be replaced with a different one. <br /><br />It is the goal of meditation to decrease the frequency of these and increase your efficiency of dismissing them. It isn&#039;t easy and drugs may help in a short term, but I see it as a crutch you&#039;ll eventually have to forgo if you want to continue a lifestyle that includes meditation. <br /><br />Try some guided meditation from YouTube. One I like is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyy0ra2WcQQ -- It does wonders for going to sleep. <br />

I&#039;d personally go with sativa dominant (60 / 40 ish) <br />Bubblegum used to be great for my creativity. Don&#039;t know why that particular strain was so conducive to creative thought processes but it just worked.

				I find that kratom is pretty good for this.&nbsp; It&#039;s a legal herb, works on opiate receptors.. there is a lot of variety in the alkaloid content from strain to strain, so some are energetic and euphoric, others are euphoric and sedating, and some are relaxing and meditative.&nbsp; pm me if you want suggestions..
