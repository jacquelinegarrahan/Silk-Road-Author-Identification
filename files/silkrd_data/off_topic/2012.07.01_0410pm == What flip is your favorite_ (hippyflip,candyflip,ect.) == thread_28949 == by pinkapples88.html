				I just want to see what everybody elses opinions are on MDMA combinations.I think my personal favorite is Either Nexus flipping (2c-bxEcstasy) or Candyflipping (LSDxEcstacy).It would be interesting to see what other people think.Maybe you guys can give some new suggestions that I can try&nbsp; ;) haha

				I say Kittyflip, even though I&#039;ve never done K or MDMA, but the next best thing, a combination of MXE and M1 which I found very pleasant.

				I still can&#039;t help but wonder if taking MDMA and Datura together would give you the vivid hallucinations without them being scary. It makes logical sense, MDMA makes everything better. Somebody should try this, for science.

				Ive tried datura alone and needless to say it was fucked up and I was pretty calm through out but the audi hallucinations were really annoying and Im interested if that would work because the only thing I mixed with datura was weed and that just amplified the paranoia and made the trip more hazy.Unfortunately I dont have any access to datura atm but maybe some X mixed with another deleriant? A large amount of diphenhydrimine maybe? In my opinion the large dose of diphenhydramine that I tried was actually scarier/more overwhelming than datura.Should I try a deleriantxecstacy combo? Strictly for science of course&nbsp; ;) haha

				I&#039;m partial to Sparkle Flipping (2C-E+MDMA) but nothing beats a proper Jedi Flip. ;)

				I think its safe to say that many people would consider MDMA + LSD the single best drug combo there is!!

				What about LSD+Mushrooms?<br /><br />When i was selling LSD i would eat some at least once a week (gotta test the product eh?)<br /><br />Every now n then i would throw a couple g&#039;s of mushrooms into the mix. Any time we would eat mushrooms with our acid the night was filled with constant hysterical laughter. <br /><br /><br />LSD+MDMA is a favorite for raves and festivals though. The MDMA keeps me &#039;grounded&#039; so i don&#039;t get too &#039;in my head&#039; from the acid and don&#039;t get too spun out, but it adds a nice psychedelic flavor to it : )<br />The way they combine is great!!<br />Definitely my go-to drug combo<br /><br />After eating some amazing crystal MDA at Red Rocks last fall I&#039;m determined on trying MDA+MDMA, maybe throw in a little LSD or K in there.

				Yes Ive taken shrooms and acid a time or two and in my own experiences (not saying its the same for everyone) but the times that Ive done mushie and acid together the acid always seemed to kind of overpower the mushrooms effects,even after the second time that me and a friend tried this combo I took 1 hit of pretty potent acid I would guess close to 200 micros and ate around 2.5 grams of home grown &quot;golden teacher&quot; mushrooms and the acid still seemed to overpower most if not all of the mushrooms effects.But as for other great combinations I know theres plenty of other great combos for example I enjoy speedballing every once in a while (CokexHeroin) I kind of enjoy DmtxMushroomsxMdma.I LOVE mescaline (peyote) and ecstasy together! If you havent tried it I would really recommend it I would almost be willing to say the I enjoy Mescaline/Mdma more than I like candy flipping. But I couldnt add all these different variations I just listed the most frequently used combinations and seeing what others like compared to what I like.
