				I was looking at antipolygraph .org (spelled something like that) and found a LOT of info about passing a poly. The one drug that has proven to work is nowhere to be found...<br /><br />Originally I thought beta blockers like propranolol would help while not be flagged in a standard 9 panel drug test - but that just flat lines your sympathetic response and so you still have to create some sort of stimulus (pain or mental) in order to read positive for their control questions.<br /><br />What I DID find however is a schedule III drug called &quot;meprobamate&quot; marketed under the trade names Equanil and Miltown.<br />It has similar properties to Soma but is something of a hypnotic according to erowid. Meprobamate was proven to greatly increase results and not just result in a&nbsp; 30% inconclusive score like beta blockers.<br /><br />It seems like the US stopped manufacturing meprobamate in the 80&#039;s and so I was curious,&nbsp; does anyone know where to get this drug? OR has anyone else successfully passed a polygraph taking some sort of drug or has anyone trained to pass one? (I would also think that a court would have some sort of drug test at some point in time that might detect common drugs such as benzos or opiates).<br /><br /><br />..... Almost posted this in security, not sure if this is the right category. It&#039;s only security if you got fucked by PD and are in court or something&nbsp; :o

				Polys are the worst they have a 60% success rate (which isn&#039;t that much higher than pure guess 50%). Our legal system doesn&#039;t even allow them in court they are largely used as deterrents and are designed to scare people.<br /><br />Lie on multiple questions that fucks up a lie detector. Also look up how they work, all they do is measure physiological nervous responses (like you sweat levels, butt clenching in chair, etc.)<br /><br /><br />You can beat it without drugs easy if you know what your doing.
