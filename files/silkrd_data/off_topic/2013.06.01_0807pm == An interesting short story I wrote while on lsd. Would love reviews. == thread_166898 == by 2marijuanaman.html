				“Peek-a-boo. Don’t touch him again or I’ll blow your Goddamn head off!” Isaiah shouted with a commanding voice. He had just burst in a back room of a casino to see his best friend Matt on the floor, at the feet of a man wearing a lot of flashy jewelry and a suit. There was a huge man standing guard next to them. Blood was streaming steadily from Matt’s forehead. They had apparently been in the process of cutting his scalp off with a butterfly knife. Isaiah looked at the man wearing a suit with piercing eyes that seemed like they could see right through you. What he saw when he looked at the torturer were the eyes of a shark; bloodthirsty, ignorant, and furious, yet empty. He saw momentary surprise, then a glint of terror, before the eye contact was broken. “Josh, shove his face in the floor and hold him there while I finish with this.”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Josh character stood around 7 feet tall with broad shoulders, and was wearing a pair of brass knuckles. He immediately charged at Isaiah, crossing the room in one two giant steps. He reached out his hand to grab his target by the throat, but Isaiah swiftly grabbed his hand and clasped it. There was a distinguishing crunching sound. “How’d you get that grip? That your jacking-off hand?” Josh said, wincing in pain. He threw a right hook using his free hand, but Isaiah ducked and sideswiped his legs. Josh fell to the floor. Isaiah stood up and quickly stomped hard on Joshes face several times. What was left was a hideous, disfigured being. His body was limp and he stopped moving.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the suits composure was broken. He was clearly terrified of Isaiah. “You punk-ass piece of shit!” He said, dropping his knife and producing a desert eagle. He shot Isaiah square in the chest, knocking him back but spilling no blood. He was wearing body armor under his cowboy duster. He pulled out his own sawn off 12-gauge shotgun, leaped right in front of the man, and shot him in the shoulder. The torturers arm dropped to the floor and his stub was gushing blood. He started crying in pure pain and terror. He fell to the floor and pathetically tried to crawl to the door. Matt got up and grabbed his torturers legs. “Please don’t kill me, for the love of God! I’ll pay you a fortune, PLEASE LET ME LIVE!” Isaiah and Matt exchanged a glance. “It’s your judgment day.” Matt said. Isaiah handed his shotgun to Matt, who reloaded. “Say your praye-“, Isaiah began to say, but he was suddenly thrown clear across the room, and he hit the wall with so much impact that his body left a deep crater in the wall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh looked truly terrifying now. Both eyes were popped and deflated, and a bone stuck out where his nose was. He couldn’t see, and was apparently using his echolocation. He swiped his arm in a huge circle, slamming a brass knuckle into Matt and breaking some ribs. Matt fell to the floor. This big ugly beast tried to stomp on him, but Matt rolled, narrowly avoiding a death by head trauma. He started to stand up but was having trouble because he’d suffered from blood loss, and his broken ribs were causing a lot of pain. Meanwhile, his torturer was opening the door. The room was sound-proof, but now everyone in the next room saw what was going on. You could hear screams, guns cocking, and running. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood like a red rose blossomed out of Josh’s heart, spraying the air in front of him. Isaiah had picked up the desert eagle from the floor and just used it to kill this colossal man. Matt caught up with the other man, stuck his foot on the man’s back, and boomed, “You are a worthless human being! “ CRACK. He shot the man in the face, creating an ugly mess. The brain matter would later harden into the carpeting, leaving a nasty job for the poor janitor who had to use a steam cleaner. Matt ran back inside the room with Isaiah, who shut the door and locked it. “Come on!”<br />&nbsp;Isaiah rammed his shoulder into the wall where the crater was several times, creating a hole in the wall. Matt shot the door behind them, creating some screams of pain, before following Isaiah outside. They ran through the parking lot, spotting an unfortunate man standing by his impala, looking shocked and confused to see people running out of the casino. He opened his car door to get in and leave, just as Isaiah grabbed his hand and pried the car keys out of them. The man saw their guns and booked it. They got in his car and sped off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you so much man. You saved my life.” “Of course, you’re my best friend… I brought you some first aid and a bottle of Jameson. Use that for now, and I’ll take you to a hospital in the next town.” Matt half-smiled, but the guilt showed in his eyes. “Look, I can’t leave town just yet…” he admitted. This pissed Isaiah off a little. “You wouldn’t have this problem if you’d kept your cock in your pants!” “Once they realize that she told you where I was, I think we both have an idea of what they’re gonna do to her…” Isaiah just sighed and turned into a parking lot. “Look, man… I don’t know how to tell you this. But I saw them loading a body into an ambulance on my way in…” Matt started throwing up. <br />
