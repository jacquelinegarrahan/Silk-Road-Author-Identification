				So after today&#039;s mass shooting in a Connecticut elementary school that has left 18 CHILDREN and 8 adults dead and the country in disbelief. I wonder what are some of the opinions on people&#039;s views on gun laws or gun control. I personally would much rather have a war on guns or a war on violence. Why can&#039;t we end this pointless war on drugs that the world is spending millions on, to focus on what really kills innocent lives. Why can&#039;t there be stricter background checks or lengthy interviews for guns or ammunition. I can&#039;t believe some people still think drugs are worse then guns. <br />We need to spend more money on psychological things. We need to address people with mental illnesses and things that would make someone want to go into a school and kill children at random. It&#039;s hard to comprehend what would push someone to take such an unbelievable tragic action.<br />Here&#039;s the link to an article for the people outside of the U.S.<br />http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/14/us-connecticut-towns-idUSBRE8BD0U120121214

				Because people aren&#039;t willing to be wrong, I&#039;m afraid.&nbsp; Think about all the police.&nbsp; All the people in jail.<br /><br />What happens if you decriminalize drugs?&nbsp; What do you do with the people who are already serving long sentences for possession, selling, etc.?&nbsp; Let them go?&nbsp; But they broke the written law of the land at the time.&nbsp; Keep them locked up?&nbsp; But they didn&#039;t do anything that&#039;s fucking illegal anymore, you can&#039;t.<br /><br />What about the guys who died trying to stop drugs coming in from Mexico, or anywhere for that matter?&nbsp; &quot;Yeah, uh, sorry you completely wasted your life and then lost it altogether in the name of some shit we&#039;ve decided was wrong to begin with.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s a lot more complex and engrained in this culture than it may seem at first glance, bro.&nbsp; I&#039;m not holding my breath.&nbsp; I&#039;m all for the revolution, don&#039;t get me wrong... but I don&#039;t expect to see real change before I&#039;m almost dead.

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t understand why any &#039;normal&#039; citizen needs a gun. They are designed to kill plain and simple.

				Normal citizens need guns for the same reason they needed guns to win our independence from Britain: militia.&nbsp; That&#039;s the reason we have the right to bear arms -- we *must* remain at least partially able to defend against tyrrany, whether from our own government or others.<br /><br />I&#039;m torn about assault rifles.&nbsp; I mean... they&#039;re designed to kill quickly, efficiently, and many times over.&nbsp; The average citizen has no business possessing one of these.&nbsp; And yet... if it ever came to it, the government sure as fuck would have them.&nbsp; So shouldn&#039;t we?&nbsp; Fuck it, I don&#039;t know.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to know.&nbsp; Not like my decision would change anything anyway...<br /><br /><br />(please pardon me if I sound callous... honestly, I just don&#039;t want to address the real topic of the thread)

				I think you should have the right to arms , or you&#039;re just easy targets for whoever wants to enslave you.<br />Seems someone doesn&#039;t want the people of USA to be armed, and its working well. <br /><br />The UK had a similar incident before the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 , which was at a school in Dunblane, where 18 people had died including the shooter who then committed suicide.. <br /><br />If you could think logically, a person wouldn&#039;t want to shoot school children unless he wanted to inflict a massive reaction from the public. I think there&#039;s something greater going on here than a maniac with a gun.

				This is so fucking stupid. Every time a crime involving a GUN happens, all the dip shit bottom feeders start begging whoever is in power to TAKE AWAY ALL THE GUNS..<br /><br />Ask yourself this: HOW WOULD THE SITUATION HAVE TURNED OUT IF THE TEACHERS HAD GUNS? How many kids would have been saved if Ms. Thompson in Rm. 101 shot this fucking asshole in the face?<br /><br />People kill people.. guns are a tool... period.. anyone who tells you different probably thinks that a murder cannot happen without a gun.<br /><br />There is NO legislation that will ever prevent gun crime. Criminals will always find ways to take guns. In Detroit, police are killed with knives for their guns. It is impossible to prevent violent crime by restricting gun sales.<br /><br />Please change this terrible line of flawed logic. If you want to prevent crime, get a gun license, and shoot some asshole before he kills his next victim.

				An absolutely nauseating situation which will only get worse as the politicians exploit it to push their anti-gun agendas. <br /><br />Gun laws do fuck all to stop violence. Why can&#039;t people grasp the concept that criminals DO NOT CARE ABOUT LAWS? If you associate yourself with this website you should be well aware of that fact.<br /><br />Even if you aren&#039;t capable of thinking logically, can&#039;t you at least examine facts? Shooting incidents practically doubled in the UK after handguns were banned. People ought to stop letting emotions cloud their judgement so much, unfortunately there are some people amongst us who are incapable of empathy and banning guns will do nothing to change that.

Full nuclear disarmament would be a wonderful thing, but it can never happen because we can&#039;t exactly trust every nation to comply.<br /><br />Same thing with guns. Maybe we would be better off if nobody had them, but that isn&#039;t possible because so many people already do. What do you think would happen if guns were outlawed? Responsible people who use them for self defense would now be left defenseless, and those who commit disgusting acts like what took place today would still have them, because they don&#039;t give a shit if it&#039;s legal or not.<br /><br />I would absolutely agree that the world would be a safer place if all guns magically disappeared, but that isn&#039;t going to happen. Taking them away from the people and leaving them only in the hands of criminals and the government (criminals), is not exactly &quot;safer&quot;<br />

				This morning while hearing about this on the news radio, I wanted to cry. At first there was a shooting and nobody was dead, 25 minutes later, 26 were dead.&nbsp; Now the total is in, its 28 in connecticut and maybe one in new jersey. Hundreds of people&#039;s lives are now all fucked up because of one deranged lunatic and a few guns. I understand how the public can demand gun control but it really wont stop anything, like previous posters have already brought up. What we need is proper protocols to follow when these type of things happen. Telling kids to get in a corner and hide is not proactive and only puts them in more danger then they are already into. They need to be taught to think on their feet and come up with many ideas to &quot;get out&quot; safely. While listening to the news radio they had a teacher who was explaining how she took 3-4 students into a closet and &quot;played games with them to keep them focused on something other then the shooting&quot;. I wanted to strangle this retarded teacher. Hide in a closet? To me this seems like the last thing you would want to do, and to be &quot;playing games&quot; on top of it is un-comprehend-able to me. Schools are big, most of the time there is more then one entrance and multiple floors. Unless this teacher was in the classroom next to the principle, which is from what I understand the starting point for all this regarding the school shooting, she should have tried to escape the school. We teach our kids if a building is on fire that they need to leave the building, I see it the same way with a shooter on the loose.<br /><br />The sad truth, what we need, is actually MORE guns and more people trained to kill with their gun if need be! If the teacher or some members of the faculty were armed this whole thing may have been avoided. We as citizens call the police when confronted with an issue when violence may be needed to end a bad situation. We need to cut out the middle man and take care of us. The criminals will always have guns and the deranged will always be deranged and can snap at any time. We need to step up and start taking action. We need to arm the professionals to whom we intrust the responsibility to care and teach our children, who are the future.<br /><br />arm our teachers and lives will be saved.<br /><br />MM

				These kinds of things make me wonder what the fuck is our world coming too? It&#039;s terrible. What&#039;s very sad is the kids were too young to even try to defend themselves, let alone know what&#039;s going on in the first place. Did anyone else watch Obama&#039;s speech on the tragedy? He almost cried. One thing I respect him for is his ability to stand up and speak on matters such as this.

				One question few people ever ask is why these mass school shootings seem to be increasing in frequency ? If the problem is easy gun availability , why weren&#039;t people walking into elementary schools and mowing down kids back in the 1920s when anybody could buy a tommy gun by mail order ? These type of mass&nbsp; shootings really started in the 1960s with the University of Texas Shooting, but they did not become common until the 1980s.&nbsp; I think all of these crimes start out as suicides and once a person decides to kill themselves , anything goes.&nbsp; The media spotlight is what they seek. The brighter the spotlight the more of these shootings happen. With the dozens of TV channels now doing round the clock coverage of these events with a focus on the shooters life story and motives, it only serves to encourage more suicidal individuals to go out with a bang.

				Firearms are indeed tools. Whether they are used for sport, defense or any other purpose, they are tools. People misuse them, just like knives or bow and arrows or fireworks. Eliminating them from the public&#039;s access is asinine, people will get guns no matter how illegal or legal they might be (just like drugs!). However, some rules are necessary so they don&#039;t end up in the wrong hands, that&#039;s why we have background checks, waiting periods, etc. Automobiles kill far more people than guns do (at least in the US of A), so maybe we should ban those too? <br /><br />Instead of blaming it on political agenda, firearm rights, or insane people, I think this is a different type of incident. Consider this a failure of the institution&#039;s security. Yes, schools have lock-down procedures and buzz-ins but they obviously didn&#039;t work. Now maybe if there was some sort of armed police officer or security guard at the school, the shooter could have been stopped a lot faster.<br /><br />Not only would the shooter have been stopped faster, but maybe would have thought over his plans after seeing an armed guard or police officer inside the school. Not to mention it would create a job or two for a country that needs it. Add up all schools in the nation and you have a new union of official school guards/police&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />It is a public institution, and the students have to attend. I would file a lawsuit against the Department of Education or other federal entities that are in charge of schools. I would say that the students were not protected or &quot;safe&quot; in the school. Whether it be directed at the government, or the school itself, action should be taken at all schools to insure children&#039;s safety. Even my high school had 1 armed police officer in the commons at all times. Just like the government is responsible for our national security and defense, they should equally be responsible for the safety of individuals inside its buildings and institutions, it only seems fair.<br /><br />I know some of our friends in Europe don&#039;t really understand the logic behind the second amendment, and &quot;guns are dangerous&quot; and anything along those lines, but there is data that shows more guns = less crime. Concealed carry permits have prevented many burglaries, assaults and other dangerous crimes, whose to say a teacher with a concealed weapon couldn&#039;t have stopped this a lot faster? When seconds count the police are only minutes away folks. <br /><br />I don&#039;t feel its a problem of guns, but rather public security. After all, that would be like saying spoons make Rosie O&#039;Donnell fat.......&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thoughts and prayers go out to the victims.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

These type of mass&nbsp; shootings really started in the 1960s with the University of Texas Shooting, but they did not become common until the 1980s.&nbsp; I think all of these crimes start out as suicides and once a person decides to kill themselves , anything goes.&nbsp; The media spotlight is what they seek. The brighter the spotlight the more of these shootings happen. With the dozens of TV channels now doing round the clock coverage of these events with a focus on the shooters life story and motives, it only serves to encourage more suicidal individuals to go out with a bang. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />People did go around mowing people down with Tommy guns...

				I definitely think the media should receive a lot more blame for these kind of incidents.&nbsp; I am convinced the reason these kind of shootings are becoming more and more common is because all the sick fucks out there know that they can become famous through the media by going on a killing spree.&nbsp; They&#039;re pathetic losers nobody gives a shit about, so in order to make themselves known to the public they do increasingly more disturbing stuff like this knowing the media will give them endless attention for it.&nbsp; I think if the media reported on these things differently and basically just called the shooter some anonymous loser, I don&#039;t think we&#039;d see as many of these happening.&nbsp; I think America is way past gun control at this point, it&#039;s like putting a band-aid on cancer given how many weapons are out there already.&nbsp; It&#039;s just pointless to do a war on guns because it would work about as effectively as the war on drugs.<br /><br />I think the shooter&#039;s mom was pretty goddamn irresponsible though for owning an assault rifle around her mentally ill loser of a son (he completely fits all the stereotypes of a school shooter) and not even keeping it properly locked up from where he couldn&#039;t get to it.&nbsp; I think the guy would have used pipe bombs or something else though if he couldn&#039;t have used a gun, he was probably an evil enough little fucker to have other back up plans.&nbsp; I place most of the blame on the media though, for sensationalizing these things and attracting these sick fucks to do things like this with the lure of fame/notoriety.

				This situation is very saddening. I am opposed to gun laws that prevent licensed individuals from carrying their own weapons on school property, hospitals, and churches. Criminals will act regardless of the law and this is how this situation came about. The guy was a coward and he went to a school knowing he would be able to attack unarmed victims and take control of the situation using firepower. Just the fact that he knew it would be illegal for anyone to have a gun while on school campus aside from LE probably gave him confidence. <br /><br />Would this situation of been avoided if Mass law allowed citizens to carry firearms on school campuses if they had a concealed weapons permit? <br /><br />

				<br />What about people like myself who really don&#039;t have any interest in guns or automobiles? Every day I leave my house and I see streets stuffed with traffic, I inhale pollution (which is deadly and kills people, not some hippie rhetoric) and I have to carefully navigate the world because it&#039;s designed for the car rather than the human. If you aren&#039;t ever vigilant as a pedestrian, you will eventually be struck by a vehicle. Now most people tell me I should just get a car, and I agree. But I would rather not have to, as they are expensive so I&#039;ll have to work harder (leaving me less free time) to afford one and they are dangerous. I couldn&#039;t live with myself if I made a human mistake and ran someone over. <br /><br />My point is that these freedoms aren&#039;t really freedoms at all. In a world where gun companies have shaped the culture and guns are everywhere it does make sense to make the argument that you will need to have a gun to protect yourself. And living in car world does require you to buy a vehicle if you want to keep up. But this isn&#039;t some sort of freedom, it&#039;s the opposite, and the only people who benefit are the companies trying to normalize and make essential their products. The Iphones, the car, the gun, w.e. are all great tools, and they are all useful, but when society starts telling you that you can&#039;t be free with out spending your money and time on them that&#039;s when you should start to mentally defend yourself.

Industrial society has made the meaningful exercise of human rights dependent on technology. Wouldn&#039;t you say you have the right to locomotion, to live wherever you want and with whomever you prefer? And yet, in many parts of the world, particularly the most industrialized and most urban, you simply cannot walk out of your surroundings, you MUST drive (or take a bus, plane, etc.). You have the right to express yourself, but often you must use the internet or a phone or... whatever. Societies come and go, but technology is forever. What starts out &quot;optional&quot; becomes necessary. Unless you want to live off the grid or something, but you cut yourself off from society in doing so. Moreover, if the system should ever go to war with you, maybe they want to develop on your cabin, or the government wants you to pay taxes, you will be crushed. Hell, I don&#039;t want a cell phone; it&#039;s the same as wearing a radio transponder around my neck that can be used to track me, but it&#039;s harder and harder to participate meaningfully in society without doing so. <br /><br />This is not just the private sector, the state is to blame too. The government has the biggest guns of all, in the US ours has established the biggest spying and killing machine ever seen in human history, and asserts its right to point them at you. If you recognize the right of the people to control the legitimate use of force, so that they are only governed by their own consent, it only follows that the way you exercise and enforce that right is through arming the citizenry. Otherwise, you take politicians at their word that they will not slide their lands into tyranny. It&#039;s not the only defense for freedom, but it is the last line of defense for a free people.<br /><br />It&#039;s unfortunate that the deeply disturbed are hurting people. They should not have guns, though I don&#039;t believe for a second that their not being armed would prevent them from doing harm; they will find another way. The &quot;successes&quot; of other countries who banned guns after mass murder incidents and have never seen a mass murder since are better explained by the extreme minority of human beings who will indiscriminate violence on the public. Someone will get the idea to do something else murderous in Australia or the UK or whatever, and people will die en masse. Weapons abound in this world. Arson is every bit as deadly as a mass shooting, and we would all probably get into a debate about fire safety after a mass arson, but it would be a futile attempt to make us feel good. <br /><br />Anyone can make the world burn if they will it so. The miracle of society is that the overwhelming majority do not. I think it&#039;s foolish to decide policies based on an extremely rare incident. People tell me how unlikely it is I&#039;ll ever &quot;need&quot; my firearms to defend myself; I wish I could counter by reminding them that they will most likely never be the victim of spree killing. However, the emotionally charged nature of these events and the &quot;NEVER AGAIN!&quot; mentality people develop would make it seem like I supported the murder of children. When, as I see it, a fundamental human right is at stake, the fact that the .001% of the population that wants to ruin lives will periodically cause harm in isolated incidents makes little to no difference. For the record, I thought the only thing we should have done in response to 9/11 was to install locks on cockpit doors.<br /><br />Forgive the rambling nature of my post, I&#039;m on drugs. Which I acquired illegally, despite billion-dollar prohibitory efforts spurred by a similar moral panic some time ago. The price of &quot;never again&quot; is very high, and it is always full of cracks. We should be writing regulations that encourage the use of firearms as civic engagement, through regular training and &quot;shall-issue&quot; licensing. Instead, the only &quot;common sense&quot; gun measure that come out are attempts to curb freedom such that it cannot do harm, at the expense of its efficacy. <br /><br />I mean, it&#039;s in the wording of the second amendment: &quot;well regulated&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;heavily-restricted.&quot; The people writing car laws aren&#039;t trying to end the freedom of locomotion, the people writing gun laws are trying to end the right to the freedom to defend oneself against tyranny. We can use the law to preserve both these rights and our safety, but congress will not do this, because they aren&#039;t interested in the rights, they&#039;re just interested in economic growth and stability. <br /><br />Argh... I wasn&#039;t kidding about the drugs thing, I&#039;m sorry for this terrible post. I swear I write better in real life.

The father of the CT shooter and the father of the Aurora shooter are both set to testify in the LIBOR scandal. I have also learned about the use of microwave weapons to take over he minds of targeted individuals to create assassins. I don&#039;t want to link these two notions but I cannot stop my mind from visiting the possibility that these young men were set up. I don&#039;t have time to post links but if you go to the webpage for the Center for Cognitive Liberty scientists against this kind of research are speaking out. It is real and it is happening to citizens of our country every day. I have seen the videos of the hearings and I will post them here later. I loathe wild consipracy theories btw.<br /><br />I am a father and my oldest daughter is afraid to go to school and I wept sending my baby to PDO thinking that this could just as easily be us experiencing the tragic shooting of our own children. I lift a prayer up to us all.

That was a mistake. As for 9/11, there&#039;s a tonne of unanswerable questions and &quot;coincidences&quot; that don&#039;t stack up, and so much info available regarding why this might be so, that you&#039;d kind of have to be a knucklehead to take President Bush Jr&#039;s scattered and confused explanation of the event.<br /><br />Having said that, whenever somebody attempts to talk about it logically the not-so-gifted people scream &quot;conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory&quot;, despite the fact that Bush was beginning to sound like Hitler in the lead up to his justification speech for unprovoked war with Iraq/bin Laden/Afghanistan/et al, and that his ramblings on the subject was actually a conspiracy in itself consisting of how &quot;everyone was out to get him&quot; and the U.S., so I&#039;ve pretty much given up hope of having a debate or calm, logical, rational discussion about it.<br /><br />There&#039;s no doubt terrorism is a huge concern, but Bush&#039;s definition of a terrorist and our definition of a terrorist sharply contrasts. I don&#039;t mind debating with people who have different opinions, it&#039;s a free country, I just hate it when people don&#039;t listen to ME when I listen to THEM. <br /><br />I give up.
