				Welp. Today makes my official &quot;1 year buying illicit materials on Silk Road&quot; anniversary !I registered my forum account 10 days after signing up for Silk Road. <br /><br />All I can say is: Its been a very good year. My life has turned around dramatically since coming across the website. Id just like to thank all the vendors and community members who have made this an awesome experience. I may not be a super well known member of this community but I visit the forums every day and extend a helping hand when possible. <br /><br />Silk Road has allowed me to get on my feet and have money in the bank. Never having to worry about my next meal and proving my local community with the most chemically pure drugs possible for reasonable prices. I&#039;ve seen this website grow into what it is now and I am proud to say I have been apart of it since its humble beginnings. <br /><br />It also saddens me to see the current state of things with the new buyers around here...and some vendors. The newbies on the road are almost like a cancerous tumor on an otherwise very healthy body. All the LSD scams, vendors going rogue, new buyers claiming products didnt show up or are underweight just to get some money back... or vendors being incompetent and not understanding what customer service is really about.&nbsp; Because of these new buyers being rude and inconsiderate, people like me who have perfect stats (over 80 purchases and over $20,000 spent) are asked to FE early quite often (although I never ever will) and run the risk of being ripped off ourselves because these new buyers who only buy 1g of something give vendors headaches. <br /><br />Anyway, long live Silk Road and the community that drives it. One year down and hopefully another year to come.<br /><br />If only we could get rid of the new guys though...Theyre tarnishing the name! :)<br /><br /><br />Side note: I also learned that other than our backwards as fuck drug laws in the good ol&#039; US of A, our country is way better than Limitless&#039;s.
