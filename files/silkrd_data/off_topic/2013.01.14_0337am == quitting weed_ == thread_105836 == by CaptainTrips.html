				Title says it all. Ive been smoking daily for a few years and its caused some problems. Ive tried to quit several times, but never got further than a week. Luckily THC and caffine are my worst seductions. Just looking for tips, things to do instead of smoking, etc. And who better to ask?

				So not specific to weed but I find, in general, when I want to stop doing bad stuff it&#039;s best to replace it with good stuff. The only time I&#039;m not smoking is when I am excising all the time. If you hit the treadmill or some weights, get a little healthy, eat well and people start noticing and saying nice stuff, that sort of becomes the new drug if you will. When I&#039;m being healthy, it&#039;s really easy to flash back on DAYS sitting around doing nothing, all the horrible fast food I ate, the general sense of lethargy that I existed in before.<br /><br />If you are already active and healthy likely not going to help too much but if not it&#039;s something to think about.<br /><br />As a side note, when I do my no smoking healthy time (I normally go five years healthy five years doughboy) I normally drop the caffeine too. That may be a bridge too far for you but it really is a PAINFULLY powerful drug that we all get addicted to in the west. Taking it out of the diet will help ease the tension and stress that you seek to relive with the weed which is why it might be worth a go.<br /><br />Anyway, you asked, that&#039;s the best I know, good luck!

				I quit smoking herb just over three years ago, and it was the best decision I ever made (also one of the hardest to decide to do, as well as go through with).&nbsp; <br /><br />A few things to note:<br /><br />Obviously avoiding triggers is a big thing;&nbsp; I avoided Bob Marley songs for almost a year when I quit, lol.&nbsp; <br /><br />Get rid of your stash and give away your paraphernalia.&nbsp; All of my stoner friends made out like kings when I quit...gave away my pipes, grinders, jars, vaporizer, etc. <br /><br />Try to avoid people who are going to be smoking around you (it&#039;s hard to avoid your friends, but if you let them know you&#039;re trying to quit, most will understand)<br /><br />You can distract yourself with a hobby.&nbsp; I like making music and playing video games.&nbsp; <br /><br />Carry something with you to replace weed if you get a craving:&nbsp; candy, toothpicks to chew on, coffee, cigarettes(if you smoke) etc.<br /><br />There are groups dedicated to quitting weed.&nbsp; Marijuana Anonymous DOES exist and has virtual, online meetings.&nbsp; If you&#039;re interested, a google search can help, but some people aren&#039;t into 12 step programs, which is understandable.

				I should also say that the above is also true:&nbsp; exercise!&nbsp; It really helps de-stress you, and will help you sleep.<br /><br />When quitting any sort of habitually-used substance, there will be sleeping troubles.&nbsp; I had an ambien prescription to help me sleep, but it&#039;s never advisable to quit one substance with the help of another drug.&nbsp; I can&#039;t say enough how much exercise helps with sleep.<br /><br />You will also have pretty vivid dreams (I rarely remembered my dreams when I would go to sleep stoned for a decade).&nbsp; You&#039;ll even have dreams where you&#039;re smoking herb in them, it&#039;s completely normal.<br /><br />

				Idol hands are the devils playground. Keep yourself busy. I agree that using one drug to quit another isnt a good idea. But replacing your weed with a new activity is a great idea. Work out, listen to music,&nbsp; clean up the house, play a video game...

				I sometimes like to take tolerance breaks and when I do it&#039;s really hard to quit. What I like to do is get a benzo like xanax or valium and take that for the first few days I quit to help with the anxiety then after that it&#039;s pretty much smooth sailing from there. Just make sure not to take them more then a week because you don&#039;t want to trade one addiction for another, if you do try it out...<br /><br />Like the others had said the main thing is just keeping yourself busy. &quot;Boredom is the first step to relapse&quot;.<br />
