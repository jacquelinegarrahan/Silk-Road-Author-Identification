				Well, I never thought I would have to ask for a micro-loan, but here it is.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I only log onto SR when I want to buy something,&nbsp; but wasn&#039;t able to get on before I had to leave my house to do my bit instant deposit, so it had been about a week since I had been on.<br /><br />I calculated how much I would need for the bud I wanted (based on the last time I was logged on), and made my deposit.&nbsp; Anyway, the listing was down, and the only other option leaves me .25 btc short.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never welched on a loan, if someone could help me out that would be cool.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather pay back a flat rate than daily interest, because it&#039;s hard for me to get out of my house due to disability issues.&nbsp; Money isn&#039;t the issue at all, so the next time (it will be about a week or so, how ever long my bud lasts) I make a deposit I will gladly make sure to deposit extra cash to cover the loan ... I was thinking borrowing .25 and paying back .75?&nbsp; Is that fair?&nbsp; If not let me know your thoughts.&nbsp; SR name is myrgatroiddigital<br /><br />Thanks, sorry for any inconvenience.

				Wow thanks man, I really appreciate that a lot!!!<br /><br />As it so happens, last week I loaned someone .8 btc and haven&#039;t heard from them since, but I didn&#039;t expect to either.<br /><br />Paying it forward is nice, but paying you back will allow you to do the same thing for more people. So, expect it in about a week!<br /><br />Thanks a lot Ace :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98764.msg696671#msg696671">Quote from: fuckingACE on January 02, 2013, 01:49 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=98764.msg696570#msg696570">Quote from: 1100101 on January 02, 2013, 01:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Well, I never thought I would have to ask for a micro-loan, but here it is.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I only log onto SR when I want to buy something,&nbsp; but wasn&#039;t able to get on before I had to leave my house to do my bit instant deposit, so it had been about a week since I had been on.<br /><br />I calculated how much I would need for the bud I wanted (based on the last time I was logged on), and made my deposit.&nbsp; Anyway, the listing was down, and the only other option leaves me .25 btc short.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never welched on a loan, if someone could help me out that would be cool.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather pay back a flat rate than daily interest, because it&#039;s hard for me to get out of my house due to disability issues.&nbsp; Money isn&#039;t the issue at all, so the next time (it will be about a week or so, how ever long my bud lasts) I make a deposit I will gladly make sure to deposit extra cash to cover the loan ...

But if for some reason gifts go against your beliefs or morals and you do, please don&#039;t try and give me .75BTC it will just end up with me returning .5 and an endless cycle starting.... .75 BTC is 200% interest and extortionate and goes against my beliefs. .25 will suffice your need to pay back, but again, really not necessary. <br />Just enjoy the bud, chill out and feel better. <br />ACE
