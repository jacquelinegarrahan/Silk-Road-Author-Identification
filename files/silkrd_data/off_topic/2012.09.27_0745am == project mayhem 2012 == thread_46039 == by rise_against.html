				Briefly heard of this. On an off with anonymous. Sounds cool but I dont have anything to leak!&nbsp; :&#039;( Wish I did!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=46039.msg489842#msg489842">Quote from: MC Haberdasher on September 27, 2012, 08:45 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Has anyone considered the possibility that &quot;Anonymous&quot; is controlled opposition?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yessss...Well has anyone else considered &quot;Al-Qaeda&quot; is a controlled opposition to the US? Because I mean lol they are... (I&#039;m not laughing but just pointing out the irony.)<br />The awesome thing about Anonymous is that since it&#039;s decentralized anyone could immediately take part and then the next day choose not to forever. They like to put it as an &quot;idea&quot;.<br />So can the &quot;idea&quot; get hijacked? Oh fuck yeah. So I agree with you MC but it doesn&#039;t really bother me because the &quot;Anonymous idea&quot; is open and free to everyone. And IMO too many good people are present to see the truth and the setups.<br /><br />A real example: I remember when anonymous put out a news piece telling people to LOIC (ddos attack) a main wall street site / government or something, but instead the WHOLE REAL anonymous community knew that the LOIC was banned from their operations because members were getting caught and the overall community saw it dangerous to members. Many believed that it was set up by LE. <br />Either way though, it is something that could unfortunately be easily falsely advertised and operated.
