				I also use Black Market Reloaded: http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br /><br />It&#039;s still a lot smaller than SR, and the selection there obviously reflects that.<br />The biggest difference between the two is that BMR does not have a seller fee, only a small commission on sales. That means a lot of their sellers are either scammers or technically incompetent, but the escrow system works very well for buyers wise enough not to finalize early. It also means sellers with small quantities can still afford to bring their products to the market.

				I&#039;d heard about Black Market Reloaded, but I was underwhelmed. I got the feeling it was supposed to be more geared toward weaponry. I wonder how that will all play out now that the armory is up and running. Me personally, I don&#039;t have any interest in that type of thing :/<br /><br />I&#039;m also interested in hearing about other markets that may be out there so +1 for the topic. I like to broaden my horizons and know what&#039;s out there.<br /><br />Rocker

				The last time I explored other sites that were similar to SR i looked at Farmer&#039;s Market and a couple of other sites.&nbsp; These sites were mainly different from SR because they only sold large volumes of product.&nbsp; Nobody sold just an eighth of an ounce of weed or three vicodins.&nbsp; <br /><br />Open Vendor Database had a few sellers that would deal in smaller quantities but there was no escrow system and some sellers would not deal with new, untrusted buyers. I can see why SR has been successful ~~ by selling small quantities it attracts the largest group of buyers.

				SR is pretty much one of a kind when you account for all of the infrastructure and features.&nbsp; This is new territory we&#039;re pushing, here.&nbsp; Hopefully its success will encourage some competition but only the future will tell...

				I tell you what&#039;s funny.<br /><br />Always been a F2F guy, but I am great with the internet because that is how I make a living.<br /><br />I never thought you could type illicit drug terms and find these forums (topix, voy) to buy and sell drugs.<br /><br />From what I understand, and have experienced, they are full of scammers.<br /><br />I will be honest. The way I found out is because I was so overwhelmed when I first got on SR, I thought I could score a quick come up and got burned and didn&#039;t feel bad because I knew I was wrong for not wanting to learn the system here.<br /><br />However, if you are a seller, and can think of a way to verify, I am pretty sure the regular internet has a looooooooot of customers.<br /><br />I am good continuing F2F...
