				You are both the stupidest mother fuckers I have ever seen in my entire life that post the most pointless shit I have ever seen on a forum. If you&#039;re not the same person you two shit heads need to find each other and marry asap, you&#039;re perfect for each other. The kind of stupid you both have is pretty rare and for you two to find each other shouldn&#039;t go unnoticed. Thank me later kids.

				I like to think I keep it real. My karma bar can attest to that. You sir are a dick. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll make another account due to the anonymous nature of this place, and the fact that you have a status equal to a pile of hobo feces. Try playing nice next time, you catch more flies with honey than semen.

				I wouldn&#039;t sell you drugs due to the fact you have the mental capacity of an inbred fourth grader, likely watch nothing but Family Guy, and probably have stuck many an inanimate object up your ass, like pennies, and then use them to purchase things, which you then shove up your ass.
