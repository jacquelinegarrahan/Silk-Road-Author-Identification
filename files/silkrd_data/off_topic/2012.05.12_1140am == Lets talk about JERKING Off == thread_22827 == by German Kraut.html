				My 13 yr. old nephew (who is like my 3rd son since his dad is never around) was talking to me about &quot;chicks&quot;!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The subject came up because he accidentally found my old porno stash out in my garage and wanted to &quot;borrow&quot; 1. I said, &quot;just 1, dude you found a gold mine &amp; you just want 1&quot;!!!! We laughed!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I told him when I was in prison back in the 80&#039;s, porno mags were like cigarettes in jail. If one was lucky to have a VHS porno, the bids where off the chart!!! He told me DVD pornos was currency. I said, &quot;but you can get free porn on the internet anytime&quot;. He said, &quot;not really, you&#039;re an adult, kids have parental block, can&#039;t do it at libraries and our little handheld phones don&#039;t have the same quality IF we can even access it at all&quot;. <br />&nbsp;WOW! I never thought of that. As an adult, I take it for granted.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;I gave him my duffel bag of 30+ DVD&#039;s and said, &quot;you didn&#039;t get them from me, understand&quot;?<br />&nbsp;[Disclaimer: his mother busted him with mags / movies many times and basically said, &quot;I&#039;d rather him look at that stuff then have some little girls&#039; parents tell me she&#039;s ......! It&#039;s cool, trust me, his moms knows!!]<br />&nbsp;&quot;How are you gonna watch them, isn&#039;t the DVD downstairs in your living room&quot; I asked? &quot;Duh, I got my PS3&nbsp; with the HDTV in my bedroom! I also got big bottle of lotion with a roll of paper towels&quot;.<br />&nbsp;&quot;Listen to what I&#039;m about to tell ya: 1) try to keep that shit to less than 3 times a day or you&#039;ll go blind. 2) If you&#039;re right handed, learn to use your left every now &amp; then (you&#039;ll thank me later if you ever break your arm!), 3) nothing wrong with dry-jacking when you run out of lotion!!! If you&#039;re ever in jail or in the army out in the bush, spit doesn&#039;t work well..you won&#039;t regret it, son&quot; 4) anyone who tells you they DON&#039;T jerky-jerky is a liar and finally, 5) Yes, women do it too...alot!!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;MAJOR JERKY RULE: &quot;YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT, BUT NEVER-EVER GET CAUGHT!!!

Although a bit surprising that he hadn&#039;t figured out how to circumvent the parental block. Many ways to easily do that and when i was 16 I would have been as strongly motivated as a 16 year old can be to circumvent the fuck out it. :) I suppose in his case, you&#039;re his circumventer.

				So what&#039;s the most ridiculous place you&#039;ve ever jerked it?<br /><br />I&#039;d have to go with public library. <br /><br />I&#039;ve got a mate who swears that he jerked it in the back of the car whilst his parents were driving him somewhere, and disguised it by pretending to read the newspaper.
