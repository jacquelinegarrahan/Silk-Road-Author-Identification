				when I was a lurker of these forums that have taught me so many things, I read that it&#039;s better to have different SR account and forum names for safety/anonymity reasons. However, I have seen users that have the same names and I can see an advantage in doing so, ex: exchanges with vendors, giving feedback etc.<br /><br />What are your opinions? I figure if I&#039;m going to change my name, I might as well do it while I&#039;m a noob.

				Something that&#039;s perhaps not exactly the same, but a vendor in the know could figure out is still you is my personal suggestion.&nbsp; Might as well keep it similar, but not exact so there is some plausible deniability

What does matter though is if you&#039;re a vendor, to have two different accounts on SR. Do not use your buyer account as a vendor account, as those you may have bought from in the past may have your personal information and it&#039;s entirely possible they may out you as a vendor to LE.<br /><br />As long as you keep information to a minimum on both the forums and SR, you should be fine with using the same username on both. A lot of vendors do it, and so do buyers.

				I think its a good idea for a seller to have a forum name that matches their SR name.<br /><br />As for buyers, TBH I think its probably better if your SR and forum names are different.<br /><br />You dont want to accidentally upset a seller and then unknowingly buy from them!

				I have the same ones for my buyer account and for my forums account.For one because I was to lazy to think of a new name and password and two because if I&#039;m talking to vendors in the forums they&#039;ll remember me.
