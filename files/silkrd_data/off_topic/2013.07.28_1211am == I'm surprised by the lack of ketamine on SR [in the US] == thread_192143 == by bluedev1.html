				Special K seems like a popular enough drug that there would be more than 6 listings for it on here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also noticed in recent years the price on the street has more than doubled.&nbsp; Used to go for $50/g now it&#039;s up to about $100/g.&nbsp; Is it just hard to get ahold of nowadays?

				We had some up recently for about $65/gram. Look for us in the next week or so, as we&#039;ll be restocking. I believe I&#039;ve seen lochstock carry some inexpensive ket as well.

				Canada has been experiencing droughts of it on and off for a while, I understand a good percentage of what&#039;s available here used to be stolen from vet clinics or animal supply places and they&#039;ve been cracking down on that.

I&#039;ve seen three kilos sell for ~$5,000. However, if you were importing kilograms you would not have ran out of stock while selling it at $65/g, as you would have large quantities and would be making serious profit. So maybe your sources just suck compared to mine. There&#039;s no shame in that.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have no doubt you&#039;ve been in the game a while, and I must say those prices are indeed impressive. If we had your sort of connections our prices would be much more competitive. We run a little steeper right now just because we aren&#039;t moving anywhere near that kind of weight, however we&#039;re working our way up to it. Gotta crawl before you can walk, right?

				It has been extremely difficult to acquire Ketamine for years now. Sources from Mexico were shut down in the early 2000s I believe. Before that it was quite easy to acquire.
