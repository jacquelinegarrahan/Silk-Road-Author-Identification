				Firstly, there is curing and drying, many people get confused, and think they&#039;re the same thing, they&#039;re not, but they are part of a two step process. Drying is what you believe it is, extracting the water from the buds. After the buds have been dried enough, the curing process can begin to remove the chlorophyll and other compounds that break down, whilst other components such as the terpenes (hydrocarbons found in the essential oils of the bud) will maximize the flavour and allow the aroma to develop (this is bud&#039;s equivalent process to maturing fine wine lol!). Both parts are equally important for insuring the quality, flavour, smell, smoothness of your buds is on point. If you take fresh buds, and dry them out too quickly it will taste harsh and very nasty (just like not processing an olive correctly, try eating one raw fresh off the tree, it&#039;ll make you cry lol!). Drying takes time, and should never be rushed, slower drying, followed by taking your time curing, produces quality bud. Hope this gives you a better scientific understanding :)

				Zen I was just being a dick mate. I just don&#039;t like weed so I thought I&#039;d make a silly comment. Wasn&#039;t being serious. :)<br /><br />And I don&#039;t like weed because I think it&#039;s basically the green and more friendly looking version of smack. People get mentally crutched on it, it makes you slow and stupid, kills aspiration, drive and ambition, makes people fuck their education up, and it&#039;s fuck-hard to kick and it can make you into a complete paranoid head-fuck. Also I hate all the complete bullshit you hear people come out with about puff like &quot;Oh it&#039;s not really a drug&quot;, &quot;Smoking weed can get rid of depression&quot; or my favourite &quot;It&#039;s natural so it isn&#039;t harmful&quot; there are loads of others but I can&#039;t be arsed to think of them. Also I can&#039;t stand the culture of it and generally speaking drippy stoners piss me off. Of all my years of drug dealing which are numerous indeed the most problems I have had is with fucking stoners when I used to sell weed. It&#039;s the absolute bullshit that they pop that I can&#039;t stand like trying to ask for tic at the last minute or claiming they don&#039;t have enough money coz &quot;They got stoned mannnn *chuckle* must have just picked up a 20 instead of a 10&quot;. Last person who did that got their face on the dirty side of the soul of my shoe and after that I never sold it again. <br /><br />

				Although I agree that long-term pot use and the practices that stoners display definitely promotes laziness, I&#039;d say it&#039;s up to the individual. I have a friend who&#039;d much rather smoke weed than take his anti-psychotic medication. The killing aspiration part I agree with because it directly feeds the reward centers of your brains. <br /><br />But personally, if I never smoked weed, I wouldn&#039;t be as open minded as I am now. I&#039;d either be a weak, antisocial nerd or a faggot douchebag that looks down upon the lower classes. It has it&#039;s place in everyone&#039;s life but only a handful of people like Carl Sagan can smoke it their whole lives and still reach their heights.

Personally, on the sesh, I prefer to do coke, and have a high grade indica with me, to round my night off. I am not a daily user, I just indulge when I wish to. Like Limetless says, I have seen many loose their lives to the effects of marijuana, but I have also seen many tolerate it perfectly well, like I do. Like everything in life moderation is the key, and if you feel that your becoming to heavily addicted to ANY drug (legal or not), then it&#039;s really your time to seek psychological and medical help, and it&#039;s always better to seek help as early as possible before it gets out of hand. You only have one life, you must live it for yourself, the moment that you feel your starting to become a slave to anything, you must get out. Keeping the right balance is the key to success for a long and happy life&nbsp; :)

				That maybe the case for you, but I discovered weed and found out about what the government says about illegal drugs is mostly bullshit. This then made me to research into other drugs, this interested me a lot. Which led on to me trying mephedrone before it was banned. As the weed dealer I had at that time didn&#039;t sell anything else, I had to find other sources to get MDMA, So for me, my weed dealer didn&#039;t have one in one hand, one in the other. If ya get my drift..<br />People just need to be educated about drugs properly I think, it would help alot.

				You have to put more effort in to sell weed. It seems any other drug i have moved, almost moved itself quickly. I hate weed O clock. The famous line:&quot;i&#039;ll be there in twenty bro.&quot; In weed time that normally means an hour.

It seems any other drug i have moved, almost moved itself quickly. I hate weed O clock. The famous line:&quot;i&#039;ll be there in twenty bro.&quot; In weed time that normally means an hour. With most other drugs:&quot;i&#039;ll be there in twenty.&quot; means they show up in twenty minutes or ten minutes early haha. <br /><br />Also, i like your comparision limetless of weed to downers. Weed does have an unmotivation factor. You end up getting hungry, sleepy, and lazy. I understand people who grow for personal, but people who try to make a business out of it? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Easy enough. I pay £1,500 a month for some guys to take the blame and grow the money :) I get £30,000 back every 2 months - simple maths :) Even better if you consider you can have many of them on the go and you never even need to touch anything :).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />£1500 wont get you loyalty for shit. If they get clocked, they&#039;ll roll on ya no doubt about it. <br /><br />Also StExo can I ask why you don&#039;t have a sellers account? Make no sense when you have a thread about it.&nbsp; :-\<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>He&#039;s got a point. I&#039;ve only had two people in my whole life keep their mouth shut. The sad thing is, you have to assume you&#039;re going to get snitched on and prepare for that by &quot;limiting&quot; their knowledge of yourself as well as how your business operates. Some people will rat just so they can get rid of the competition. Don&#039;t get to comfy and think your homeboy won&#039;t take you down with him when he&#039;s looking at 10 to 15.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The only way to guarantee it is ensure they realise they will die if they do anything. It&#039;s that cut and dry I&#039;m afraid.

Pot dealers have it so freakin easy im not sure what you meant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />See this is a prime example of a post that never need to be typed and posted.<br />Pointless bickering.
