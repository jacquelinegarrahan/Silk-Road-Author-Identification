				Looking to extract once more, but I can&#039;t seem to find any U.S. based MHRB retailers on the web.&nbsp; Ever since a widely known online retailer got raided by the DEA, every other online shop removed MHRB from its inventory.&nbsp; Please suggest U.S. based ones, I don&#039;t want to deal with customs.

				I actually have no idea where I came up with that just remember someone telling me I couldn&#039;t order it anymore because of that.&nbsp; I can&#039;t find anything about that at all, other than there have been alot of arrests talked about for importing it on the forums.&nbsp; sorry for the bad information.&nbsp; What about Acacia Confusa?&nbsp;

				M. tenuiflora IS M. hostilis. The most widely used substitute is Acacia confusa. I hear it&#039;s got a pretty good concentration of the desired alkaloids, but I have not used it.<br /><br />Then of course there is good ole Phalaris arundinacea and P. aquatica. They have a mixture of DMT and 5MeO-DMT. Yummy. A straight wheatgrass juicer extraction, leaving the juice to dry and then vaping it (or smoking it with innocuous herbs like parsley) gives out of this world results, according to the venerable Jim DeKorne, author of Psychedelic Shamanism.<br /><br />But MHRB in the US is a dead horse, let&#039;s stop beating it. Unless you want to risk smuggling.<br /><br />goblin

My advice: forget it.<br /><br />With respect to A. confusa, I sinply don&#039;t know enough to say anything about the yield. It should be less than from MHRB, but that&#039;s just conjecture at this point. People should do a search on mycotopia, the shroomery and dmt nexus as well as erowid. From&nbsp; Erowid you can get answers about the legal ramifications of it, but as far as I know, it&#039;s still very cool.<br /><br />goblin

				I order MHRB from a friend in southern mexico. I usually get several kilos at one time. I wouldn&#039;t risk it though. I have a rock solid drop location.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don&#039;t think much would happen if it were intercepted. It just isn&#039;t that much of an issue really. I have had stuff confiscation from other countries before and nothing ever happens.<br /><br />PLEASE don&#039;t take this as advice. This is just my personal opinion.
