				Has anyone watched this movie? It&#039;s about a guy who goes on tripping with DMT (or maybe Salvia) and a bunch of really trippy visuals to show what it&#039;s like to be tripping. I&#039;ve never broken through on either DMT or Salvia so I&#039;m wondering how close the animations are to the real deal. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a trailer from the movie that looks alot like milkdrop screen saver from Winamp http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKdfYmej7Uw

				Haha, I watched enter the void some time back,&nbsp; And I took DMT about over a week ago for the first time. And to me, trying to relate to the movie with the visuals I had... dude its nothing you can compare it to. Every trip is different, moreso when you breakthrough. You enter your own mind... The Animations there could be seen for some people, because there are geometric shapes that begin to appear, when I looked at my walls there were like chiseled alien languages, patterns all around, I closed my eyes and went through some kind of universe with some kind of entity guiding me. Its bloody beautiful, and no movie can replicate the trip, unless it is your version of the trip.<br /><br />Its a good movie I have to say, I just wish the dude didn&#039;t die god dammit. Loved the scenes where the chick tried coke with him, I WANT TO GO TO JAPAN NOW.<br /><br />Anyways, Try DMT for yourself, thanks to SR, I was craving so hard to find it somewhere, It really is the &quot;spiritt molecule&quot;. Treat it with respect, or it wont treat you well.

				Yes, I&#039;ve watched it.&nbsp; That said I can&#039;t comment at all...&nbsp; I got my first 0.5g of ketamine, and ended up watching the movie in three parts, I had trouble telling where the movie ended and the drugs began.&nbsp; It was a pleasant experience though, I think I may have enjoyed the movie sober.
