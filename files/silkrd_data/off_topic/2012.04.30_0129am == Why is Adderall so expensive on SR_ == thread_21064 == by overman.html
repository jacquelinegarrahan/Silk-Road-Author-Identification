				I&#039;ve never bought it in person before, but browsing online it seems that the street value for 30mg should be 3-10$, yet here all I see is $18+ a pill. I heard from a friend that it can help you study/work on a whole new level, but $18 for faster work doesn&#039;t seem to be worth it. I&#039;d appreciate any insight on whether or not I should buy some here.

				It&#039;s probably easier to get a prescription if you really need it. I have some pretty bad ADD and I&#039;m always amazed at how well I can focus when I do mdma or other similar drugs. I feel like &quot;me&quot; again. I agree it&#039;s pretty expensive on here.

				None of your answers really explain it.<br /><br />Yes, if people will pay it that determines the price, in a reductionist way. But that&#039;s basically just a smartass answer.<br /><br />Cocaine is about 2x as expensive as it should be on SR, yes, but Adderall is literally 5-8 times as expensive. Fucking ridiculous. <br /><br />There must be some kind of rational explanation. Is there some amazing method of use I don&#039;t know about?<br /><br />Shiny

Lot&#039;s of demand, low supply = high price. And vice versa it gives low price..<br />2: The Adderall sellers made a deal with each other not to sell below a certain price, also called a &#039;cartel&#039;. That is illegal in the real world, but on the interwebs there&#039;s not much you can do about it. <br /><br />

PM me if your interested in a deal that could make us both very happy! :)
