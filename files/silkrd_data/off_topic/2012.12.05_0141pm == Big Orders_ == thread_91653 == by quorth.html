If you choose shipping with tracking, it is included in your order. If you did not choose the shipping with tracking option before you paid for your order then there is likely very little you can do.<br /><br />If you can provide a link to the vendor&#039;s account then I will be able to see what shipping options they offer, and can advise you further as to the direction you will have to take from here.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I speak French and a little German if that is any help to you? <br /><br />The vendor means that when you click on the page for a large order there is a section beside the picture that says &quot;postage options&quot;. This tells you which methods of postage are available for you to purchase.<br /><br />For example, in this listing: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/28e9f281a7 there are 4 options;<br /><br />1) NL (฿0.13)<br />2) EU (฿0.2)<br />3) world (฿0.27)<br />4) track &amp; trace (฿1.37)<br /><br />You selected the &quot;world&quot; postage option, which means that the vendor shipped this without a &quot;track &amp; trace&quot; option, as you did not pay for a tracking number. It costs the vendor more money to ship with a tracking number, so they charge more for that option. You cannot pay for it after you have placed your order (unless you contact the vendor), and can not change it at all once the item has been put &#039;in transit&#039;, because the vendor has already packaged and sent the item.<br /><br />To purchase tracking you have to select &quot;track &amp; trace&quot; BEFORE you pay for your items. If you did not select that option, then the vendor did not send the item with a tracking number.<br /><br />If you paid for separate shipping for your 3 items then they should have been sent separately, unless you came to a different arrangement with PremiumDutch. You cannot pay 1 shipping for 3 items unless you request a custom shipping option from your vendor.<br /><br />Again, if you speak French or German I might be able to communicate a little more clearly with you. If not, feel free to post your issues in your native language - we have members from all over the world here, and someone else may speak the same language as you.<br /><br />You can also PM me if you would prefer not to say what your native language is on the forum for security reasons.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />- grahamgreene
