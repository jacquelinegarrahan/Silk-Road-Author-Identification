				So heres my situation... I want to get my little cousin a fake ID so he can come and party with us, hes only 17 but could pass for 21 pretty easily, so thats not the problem, the problem is that the number one fake ID seller on SR is an Ohio ID..... So I&#039;m wondering if we go to the clubs, casinos, whatnot, if he has his Ohio ID and I have an ID from a different state, will that raise suspicion and cause problems? If were with a group of friends and we all have IDs from one state while hes got an ID from Ohio, I feel like that could raise some eyebrows, we were even talkin about going to dayglow to roll our faces off but you gotta be 18 for that :/, he&#039;d definetly pass for 18 no questions asked, but if were in a big group while we all have IDs from on state will he stick out? Thank you for any input!!

				Oh you silly Americans and your no alcohol for under 21s.<br /><br />I&#039;d say him having a ID for a different state would make him stand out. Whats the problem does the road not have an ID from your state?<br />No matter what I&#039;m sure you can find someone on the deep net to make an ID for any state you need.<br /><br />I check out HackBB and Black Market Reloaded, see if you can find it there. If you can&#039;t find it there check The Hidden Wiki or Tordir for other sellers.<br /><br />HackBB: http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/<br /><br />BMR: http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/<br /><br />Cleaned Hidden Wiki: http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />Tordir: http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/<br /><br />If you do find someone selling what you need on another site, Remember ALWAYS STAY IN ESCROW not matter what!&nbsp; <br />

				KingofClubs is a good seller. I used him for ID. He has a massive list. But just don&#039;t get the id for the same state you are going to be in.. It&#039;s fine using out of state.. He could just be there visiting you or w/e. Use it with confidence!

				I was shopping for a fake ID recently (eventually went with the Ohio one, though, for a number of reasons), and I ran across a seller on BMR who had the following states listed:<br /><br />New York, Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey DL, New Jersey ID, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,<br />Washington State and Wisconsin<br /><br />Here&#039;s his url: http://5onwnspjvuk7cwvk.onion/index.php?p=view_listing&amp;id=7102&nbsp; (and, if you buy from him, tell him he owes me for the advertising!)<br /><br />I will say, though, that $300 is a little pricey just to get into a club.&nbsp; The SR vendor selling Ohio and Florida IDs is highly reviewed.&nbsp; Get your photos taken at someplace that does passport photos, and that Ohio ID should be good to go.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m going to give you my best advice as I&#039;m american and I started usimg a fake id when I was preeeettttttyyyyy young, and I&#039;ve spent way too much time in bars/clubs/etc. All this advice really depends on where you are going out, too. If you&#039;re going to a club in Manhattan these rules don&#039;t apply the same than if you are going to a casino in Vegas, a sportsbar in Ohio, Bourbon Street, or a dancehall in Texas.<br /><br />-sorry if this is obnoxious to say, but the easiest thing to do is find one of your friends or family members that very vaquely resembles him. Borrow (or take/borrow) their ID for the night. If he is truly with a bunch of older guys then the bouncer/bartender/owner isn&#039;t going to really care. and have him use that. Especially if it&#039;s all family. <br /><br />-some places use those machines and actually swipe it. If that&#039;s the case then idk if that&#039;ll work with a fake (maybe from SR, though, shits legit here) so really, your best bet is to get a real one. <br /><br />-BE CONFIDENT that&#039;s really the only thing the bouncer or bartender is going to be looking for when they ask for ID, most times they won&#039;t even look at the age if your body language and ORDER is done in confidence. so my next point<br /><br />-know EXACTLY what drink you are ordering, don&#039;t hesitate. and if you prefer a cocktail KNOW EXACTLY what&#039;s in the cocktail. If you really want to sound confident, then order top shelf... you&#039;ll be spending a lot more money, but you&#039;ll seem m ore seasoned to drinking than, say, if you decide to go with a Bud Light.<br /><br />Good luck in your search.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL AND DON&#039;T FUCKING DRIVE<br /><br /><br />

				^^^^^I have to agree 100% with BEING CONFIDENT. Confidence and operating smoothly will always take you a long ways :). Might sound crazy, but when I was under 21 I went into liquor stores all the time and just handed them my regular id (even with it showing I was under age) I was so confident every time I did it....and it worked everytime lol(of course you have to look older), being confident can be used to your advantage when interacting with others IRL....ahhhh the old days.

				All of these guys said it right, just be confident.<br />When I go to liquor stores with my regular ID to get alcohol I&#039;ll have my ID in my hand like I&#039;m ready to give it to them and usually they don&#039;t ask to see it. The logic is, why would he be ready to show it to me if he has it out.<br />Know what you want to drink, and just look like you&#039;re doing nothing wrong. Some people have nervous faces but I feel like if you are on the Silk Road you probably have some kind of confidence.<br />When I get rejected occasionally I&#039;m just like &quot;cooommmeeee onnnnnn man I&#039;m just tryna get fucked up like you gonna do when you get off, why you gotta hate&quot; occasionally that works too haha.<br />Just be a cool chill ass individual, and most of all whether it&#039;s true or not appear to give no fucks.
