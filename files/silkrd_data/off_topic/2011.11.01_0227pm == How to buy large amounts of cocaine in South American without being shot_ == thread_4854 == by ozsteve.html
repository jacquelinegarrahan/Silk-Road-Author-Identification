				I have a real need for 1kg+ of charlie in the UK.<br /><br />You may scoff but I run a middle ranking night club in London and I give away 5g a night, easy. That&#039;s 15g a week and nearly 1kg a year. At street prices.<br /><br />Her&#039;s a thought experiment, you brainboxes on Silk Road (and I mean that sincerely - the knowledge on here is exemplary).<br /><br />How can a random punter in London score a kilo off the street in Bogota (or ay other South American city) at local prices without getting ripped off or shot?<br /><br />I can send a courier to a hotel room, but how is that better?<br /><br />What&#039;s the shizzle?<br /><br />Ideas, people?

				You can pick up a kilo of llallo in Bogota for under Â£2k.<br /><br />Coke, like lives, is cheap there.<br /><br />Just express an interest to either the concierge or bartender at&nbsp; any 3 star hotel, and you can get hooked up in a few hours, without having to meet sketchy people in dark alleys.<br /><br />Scoring llallo in S. America is as easy as falling down.<br /><br />Getting it out of S. America and back to the UK is where all the difficulty lies.

				1Kg of coke? Shipped from S. America? Good luck! The parcel&#039;s origin will alert customs straight away. You&#039;d have to somehow disguise it in with a large shipment of something legit and hope for the best.<br /><br />Like dude&#039;s already said, buying it&#039;s a piece of piss, getting into your country is where the hard work is.

				I really dont think you will get very far trying to privately import a kg into London mate. If you dont get shot in Colombia or Bolivia or wherever you WILL get busted bringing it in. Possibly because they very people you bought it off grass you up to take the attention off their own mules which they will put on your flight.<br />Why reinvent the wheel? The cartels have spent untold millions and over 40 years working out how to smuggle gear into places and they still get busted, nothing will bring you to the attention of the DEA (and therefore SOCA) quicker than turning up in South America and trying to score a kg. <br />Your best bet, if you want to save yourself some money, is get a connection in Spain and score it there. It wont be as cheap or as pure as at the source but the hard work has been done for you, that being getting it to Europe.<br />As a nightclub owner you have a legitimate reason to travel to Spain (which you can do without visas unlike SA) to check out the Ibiza scene or whatever. There are minimal customs checks if you travel overland and come in by ferry (it works, trust me) and then you are laughing.<br />What legitimate reason could you have for going to Boliva, for example? Customs will be peering up your arse with torches on your way home, if you make it home, and your card will be marked.<br />Be careful and stay in Europe, you can get it probably 10k to 15k a kilo if you look around, that will save you plenty. The problem then is that if you get raided (which is a distinct possibility) you have a possession with intent Class A in the offing, not too good. That is if you dont get carried away and cane the kilo yourself!!<br />

				You gotta be South American not to get shot. Almost anyone can buy it. It&#039;s keeping it and getting home safe is the tricky part. Let the drug gangs bring it over. They do anyways.<br />&nbsp;I buy all my cocaine needs from CFMF CantFeelMyFace and tetravort. Perfect either way. Or my South American&nbsp; cartel buddies when they are in town. Lol.
