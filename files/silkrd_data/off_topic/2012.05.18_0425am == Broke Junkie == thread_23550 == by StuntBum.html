				Life fucking sucks!&nbsp; All I want is to get high, and very soon!&nbsp; I have been waiting months to get off probation and it has finally happened.&nbsp; Now I have no job, no source of income.&nbsp; I am about to lose the house I bought four years ago which will be devastating.&nbsp; I work my ass off to do everything right (I was off probation 4 months early) but in the end I feel as if I have taken 5 steps back for each forward.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know what to do anymore, of course there is suicide but that&#039;s just not my MO.&nbsp; I have worked so hard for everything I have especially since I was pm;y 20 when I bought this place.<br /><br />I have not had the oppertunity to get fucked up properly which is sad.&nbsp; I would love me some of this fire coke I hear soo much about on the Silk Road, that or a fat sack of heroin! But at this rate I&#039;m never going to be able to do either of these things.&nbsp; HOW DEPRESSING!<br /><br />Maybe one of these days the drug gods will be looking over my shoulder grinning for me as I stare at a couple grams of each.&nbsp; I&#039;m not counting on it, but I can dream.<br /><br />I just wish something of the sort actually happens before I am truly homeless!<br /><br />God bless my mother for helping with bills when she could be now money is tight for her as well. Now I am without a doubt on my own with nothing but negative thoughts clouding my head.&nbsp; I just need a night off of all this depressing thought fueled by cocaine and heroin.<br /><br />We all know this will never happen.&nbsp; If I cant even pay my water bill, how the hell am I to score a couple grams of this bomb as coke?&nbsp; And the heroin...FUCK ME!<br /><br />Love you all!<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				And that&#039;s why I stay away from H and Coke.<br /><br />I wish you all the best though man, I&#039;ve gone through some similar shit and it really makes the difference when you have a supportive family, be very grateful for that. I hope things look up for you dude. I&#039;d donate if I could but it&#039;s against my morals and I&#039;m broke as fuck as well :(

				The reason I&#039;m losing everything is not due ti drug use, I have not used a drug in years.<br /><br />The reason I am losing everything is due to job loss and not finding anything available that will help me recover.<br /><br />I was just hoping to one day do some coke or H.<br /><br />Just because I mention these &quot;demonized&quot; drugs that automatically is the reason I&#039;m losing everything I&#039;ve worked so hard for?&nbsp; I mentioned them because I wanted ONE last dance with them, maybe to put all my thougbts ane anxiety to rest for a night.<br /><br />I really hate how some people come to the conclusion because I&#039;ve used hard drugs, that these drugs are to blame for my misery! :(&nbsp; How hurtful<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				I feel like a broken record sometimes saying this, but i&#039;ll say it again:&nbsp; Grow weed.<br /><br />If you have your own place, and can manage to keep it for the next few months, get a grow on, keep your mouth shut about it, and sell your harvest anonymously on SR.<br /><br />This doesn&#039;t help you much in the short term, but it is a potential route out of poverty.&nbsp; The initial investment is minimal, and the rewards are huge, provided you can keep your mouth shut.&nbsp; There is a learning curve if you want good results, but the plant grows slowly enough that you have time to absorb the information you need for the next stage in the process.

				No offense but labeling yourself as a &#039;broke junkie&#039; really doesn&#039;t help your case, so that&#039;s why we&#039;re more inclined to believe your despair has come by as a result of drug use. If you&#039;re really that desperate for money then sell your computer and buy your DOC from a public library. Also I&#039;m confused about the point of this thread....is this just a rant or are you trying to get pity from us? ???

Corporations move slowly, and many of them are happy for you to get into debt with them for a while, so hopefully utilities can be covered for a couple of months (and if not, there are &quot;alternative&quot; methods of obtaining them).<br /><br />My post was a suggestion as to something the OP could work towards, that will give him a fair chance of being less poor, if he can pull it off successfully.&nbsp; Growing&#039;s not easy, but it&#039;s hardly rocket science either, and the &quot;learning curve&quot; could also be considered as a &quot;hobby&quot;, and is quite a constructive and rewarding use of your time, especially if the alternative is sitting there being depressed about all the drugs you are unable to afford.

				I was a former junkie.&nbsp; Obviously people 20 years into their recovery still call themselves alcoholics or junkie&#039;s in my case.&nbsp; I&#039;m not looking for pity this is more of a rant.&nbsp; I&#039;m just at my wits end guys.&nbsp; Sorry if anyone took this the wrong way.

That was six months of impoverished hell coming up with rent, paying a much higher utility bill, and buying more supplies when I got it wrong. Like I said, totally unrealistic given the destitution he described.<br /><br />I think the intention of the OP is the same as one of those guys you see on street corners looking as pitiful as possible with their hand out chanting &quot;spare change?&quot;.
