				hahaha...i was kinda setting bait posting a link to NASA so i could address another point:<br /><br />there is no illuminati.&nbsp; no group in control.&nbsp; this is just another ironically convenient explanation of the world for weak minded people.&nbsp; the truth, which is far more frightening, is that this &quot;society&quot; is hardly at all removed from the jungle.&nbsp; its a massive chaotic orgy with no one at the helm.&nbsp; if, on occasion, some group does gain some level of control over others it only lasts for a blink of history&#039;s eye and then they are gone with someone else to take their place or for the orgy of chaos to commence.&nbsp; there is no &quot;they&quot; only &quot;us.&quot;&nbsp; if you wanna talk astronomy but you don&#039;t trust NASA, you&#039;re basically shit outta luck, and kind of an idiot.&nbsp; they aren&#039;t hiding anything from us; i don&#039;t even think they could in, this, the age of information.&nbsp; in the 21st century, everything &quot;they&quot; know, you can know.&nbsp; there are no secrets any more, save for some technical specs on experimental aircraft and weapons.<br /><br />i&#039;m sorry to speak in such definitive terms, i usually don&#039;t like to do that, but this debate warrants it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve known wayyyy too many people over the course of my life, usually from the psychedelic community, who think the freemasons are puppeteering every facet of the modern world blah blah blah, and i have to say that from empirical observation, this eventually makes people give up on life or go insane, just the same way as if you believed in the bible or scientology or something like that.&nbsp; its a fantasy, and eventually you either realize that subconsciously and give up, or you go fucking crazy trying to convince yourself and everyone around you that what you believe is true.<br /><br />i strongly recommend you stop trying to get to the bottom of this &quot;mystery&quot; and just enjoy life.&nbsp; oh, and vote.&nbsp; because these are real people in a fucked up chaotic system; not reptiles-in-human-skin playing out a meticulously planned farce.&nbsp; its time to come back to the rest of us here in consensual reality.

				Let me be more specific on this:<br /><br />At the center of the milky way galaxy, there is a black hole (astronomers have only found this in the last 8 years) but the Myans called it the &quot;Dark Rift&quot;.<br /><br />I wonder how they Myans knew this, if we only figured it out 8 years ago?<br /><br />Either way, it&#039;s the sun rising through the center of this &quot;Dark Rift&quot; that occurs every 26,000 years<br /><br /><br />And this is what I am trying to say about the Coriolis Effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAL_iIHmKI
