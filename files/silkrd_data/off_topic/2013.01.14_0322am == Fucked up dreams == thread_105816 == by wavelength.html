				alright....<br />so i&#039;m going to tell you about a dream i had last night, but in return i would like to hear about your guys &quot;fucked up&quot; dreams. even if you dont enjoy hearing about this dream (homophobes wont so you might want to leave now!&nbsp; ;D )<br />alright, i woke up in a house i did not recognize. it was a nice house, but i remember it being dirty from younger people.<br />when i got up, there was this young kid around my age there that had his boxers/tank top on like he had just woke up, but he had a stiff dick sticking through the hole in the front and he was just trying to fuck with me with homoerotic behavior.<br /><br />he does it a few more times, and at one point i was walking up the staircase as he was coming down, i was head level with his dick and he was putting it in my face so i said &quot;what do you want?&quot; and he said &quot;suck on it&quot;<br />i immediately lunged at it and put it in my mouth, and as soon as i did he backed up, took me by my hand into his bedroom, and we went until he was &quot;done&quot;.... all the while i am strangely conscious during all of this... i remember what it felt like very vividly.... and i cant lie i enjoyed it in my dream.<br />&nbsp;to say that i would enjoy doing that in waking life would require experience and i havent ever touched anyones cock, but im open minded.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />anyways, i walk out of his room, down the stairs, and out of the house and i realize i am a few houses down from my home!<br />its very dark outside and the ground is icey.<br />as im walking down the street i notice my grandma walking the opposite direction down the street! she passed me like she didnt really know me at that point.<br />i continued to walk up the street and my feet slip on the ice a little bit.<br />upon slipping i get the idea to ice skate and i start picking up a lot of damn momentum in regular shoes on an icey road hahaha.<br />as im getting closer to my house, i noticed a cop car pulling up.<br />i slow down so i dont &quot;skate&quot; into this cops car and he gets out. at that point i remember there being a backup vehicle but he drove away because the other guy said &quot;i got it&quot;<br />he led me into my house before i really realized what was going on.<br />he was pulling me by my arm and as soon as i got into my door(with him leading) i grabbed the cop by his arm, said &quot;i do not consent to any searches&quot;, spun around, and pulled him out the door.<br />he looked back at me so pissed off and screamed &quot;this is bullshit!&quot; at me, and i shut the door on him.<br /><br /><br />so that was my dream.<br />pretty fucked up if you ask me.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Wow... Just last night I had a dream, no where near as... unique as yours... but it was very vivid. I&#039;m not a short person, average at around 5&#039;&#039;8, but I was walking down a long, well paved street accompanied by a group of giant of people, at least 7 foot tall. I said.. something.. and one of these giants picked me up and threw me, I flew very far, the feeling of wind and sun on my face... Then my alarm woke me up.<br /><br />There is something called lucid dreaming, the ability to recognize and control how your dreams go, somewhat.<br /><br />There are many different tutorials on how to lucid dream. I&#039;ve been trying for a while with no luck; I do have very vivid dreams, but never have I realized I was in a dream.<br /><br />For example, you most likely wouldn&#039;t do that to another man in real life. While dreaming about a penis in your mouth, you could finally have a realization,&quot;Hey, I&#039;m in a dream&quot; and blast through the roof, superman style.

				alright here is my first lucid dream.<br /><br />i was at my friends house, and it was for sure passed midnight, judging by the faces there. we had been hanging out for a bit and i said to myself, &quot;wait a sec, im in florida.&quot; at that moment i was in my own body. i freaked out and said. &quot;guys, im supposed to be in florida, i just realized i was dreaming for the first time in my life!&quot; i looked at my close friend and he started laughing pretty hard, so i doubted myself. i thought, maybe i am here, but i quickly decided to test it. i ran straight up the wall and did a backflip as soon as the idea popped into my head, and it felt so real, but almost as if it was in slow motion.watching the rotation all the way around and taking in the room from every angle in great detail,&nbsp; including everything being upside down at one point. i basically continued to do backflips until i again thought, im dreaming, i can do far greater things than backflips. so i walked outside and looked around for while, and unlike what you would expect a dream to feel like(shifting scenes without you ever knowing they shifted), everything was smooth, just like real life. it was almost as if this was a gift,just for me to get my fix of home for a short time, because i had been kind of thinking of home quite a bit lately, and it was nice to see the familiar faces. after being outside for a while i started to slip away from this big high of knowing i was dreaming, it was almost as if i just lost all control, but it felt amazing because i still knew i was in control, but i was so relaxed. i felt like a king. shortly after i awoke, and everything that had happened was extremely vivid in my thoughts, much different than most other dreams i have had. it was amazing.

				Aw, man that sounds awesome. I just want to know the feeling you get when you actually realize you&#039;re dreaming, even if just for a few seconds, I bet the feeling is near orgasmic. <br /><br />The worst most fucked up dream I ever had was when I was quitting smoking. I used patches, and accidentally left it on over night.<br /><br />I dreamt I murdered my whole family with a cleaver, chopped them up one by one. I started with my mother, she was crying and begging me to stop, I just laughed; next was my sister, she was asleep. My father was the only one who fought back, but I ended up killing him as well. It felt so real. I finally woke up and my sheets were covered in sweat... and probably a little bit of piss.<br /><br />I&#039;ve stopped smoking since then, but that is one dream I will never forget. <br /><br />Oh, and metaphoe. What you&#039;re referring to is a false awakening. Many people use this as a basis to kick start a lucid dream (dream controlling).<br /><br />One thing you should remember in a dream, I&#039;ve heard this from many people, is to pinch your nose closed. If if in real life, you cant breathe through your nose, but in a dream you&#039;ll be able to breathe just fine. Another technique is, you know when you close one eye and you can see your nose? Well in a dream, your nose will not be visible. <br /><br />I&#039;ve never had a lucid dream, but these will be the techniques I use if I ever find myself questioning reality.

				There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man&#039;s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Silk Road :p<br /><br />lol. just tryna be funny: dam it&#039;s weird how we all can link up on this and really infer the meanings&#039;<br /><br />plus with all the experience we learn comes this power of knowledge<br /><br />I think i done got stuck in the Shroom loop with time stopping and dream walking

				I remember many of my dreams vividly. Most of the dreams that really stick out are in lucid dream state.<br /><br />I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that (for me) lucid dreams happen when:<br /><br />A) I&#039;m having trouble sleeping in general<br />B) A vivid dream seems so real I eventually ask myself &quot;Is this a dream? Or is this reality?&quot;<br />C) Lucid dreaming is mentioned around me or in conversation/self reflection <br />D) I affirm that a lucid dream is happening tonight<br /><br />I usually understand these dreams when I wake up.<br />And this has inspired me to reinstate a dream journal.<br />And yeah I affirmed that I&#039;m lucid dreaming tonight O_o<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I have had this fucked up dream on my mind for a couple of nights now and by seeing this thread, I have to reply...<br />When I dream, I tend to wake up multiple times having new dreams each time, and/or continue my previous ones. Does this occur to any of you btw? Anywho now this is how it went down.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a dark and rainy night and I was at a very familiar area in a not so familiar home. It was a very big home and messy, like some shit off the show hoarders. There was some guy there that I could not recognize, yet he looked like someone I have seen before. Now this is what threw me off, my friends Mom was there and apparently they were married and so forth although that&#039;s not her real husband... For some reason, I was very attracted to her and believe me she&#039;s no MILF...So there I was eating dinner with them, until the guy had to leave for whatever reason and this is where things got... naughty. She grabbed me and brought me into their bedroom where we preceded to take off our clothes. We started to make-out for what felt like forever and then she gave me the most vivid sex experience ever. From getting a blow job, to eating her out until fucking in many wild positions. I woke up with a woody before the climax thinking what the fuck that was awesome, and so I tried to go back to bed and continue, but sadly I started a new dream which I can&#039;t remember. Why couldn&#039;t I have that dream with some fine ass honey instead of this broad, ugh. Oh well, still a very interesting and fucked up dream.&nbsp; ;)<br />

				I have pretty fucked up dreams, too. I usually don&#039;t remember them for longer than an hour or so unless I bother to write them down. The weirdest one I had was years ago. I dreamed that I had a woman tied to a chair. She was blonde and wearing nothing but a sheet or a white dress, not sure which. I was cutting her with a knife, but I can&#039;t really see what I&#039;m doing, just her face. She appears to be smiling and encouraging me. Or mocking me, I can&#039;t really tell. In any event, I remember feeling out of control, like she (or something, the moon maybe) was making me do it. I remember there being a lot of moonlight, like thin curtains of solid light all around me so I couldn&#039;t see anything in the rest of the room.&nbsp; Then the knife pops into my vision (a kitchen knife) and it has this weird glow, like it&#039;s made of moonlight. Then, I cut open one of her eyeballs and there&#039;s something inside, but I can&#039;t remember what. I don&#039;t know what happened after that, I think I just woke up. <br /><br />When I was in high school I once dreamed that everyone at my school had become a zombie and me and a few other people were gathering on this hill where we used to stand around and smoke before and after school (just out of site of the school). I was handing out swords and axes and pieces of twisted rebar. They all looked about a thousand years old, not exactly something you&#039;d want to march into battle with. We all ran down the hill screaming and started hacking the zombie-kids to pieces. I remember it was really frustrating, because it took forever to kill one of them. For some reason there was no blood or gore, either. <br /><br />I also get more mundane dreams that feel extremely real. One time I dreamed I applied for a job at a gas station, got the job, worked for like a day and promptly forgot I had a job. I didn&#039;t go in for weeks, then went back and asked for my job back but nobody would even acknowledge I was there. I&#039;ve had this dream twice and at one point I was almost convinced it actually happened for about half a day. <br /><br />Shit, I have way too many fucked up dreams.

				I have had some pretty vivid and scary as hell dreams since I took what I think was DOB/DOX.<br /><br />One dream I was in a small government owned movie theater in Nazi Germany, as a spy.&nbsp; I had been planted there as a secretary to Goebbels, but was actually sending information back to the Allies.&nbsp; I was sitting there with all of the other people taking notes and discussing the piece.&nbsp; They had made a new movie with a very pro Nazi theme.&nbsp; The odd thing is that it was starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.&nbsp; The guy sitting next to me started flirting with me and it turned out we were both spies, he was a French director pretending to be sympathetic to the Nazi cause.&nbsp; <br /><br />So we had left the theater to go have some lunch in a cafe and were making plans to run off together to Paris when the Gestapo came and were trying to arrest us because our documentation looked suspicious and my accent was becoming more and more obvious.&nbsp; I woke up.&nbsp; I was pissed that I woke up from such a cool dream.

				whew!! and i thought that i was fucked up!!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />my turn..<br />so, i&#039;ve always had vivid ass dreams.. crazy real feeling!! well, until i started using drugs of course.. they either stopped or i can&#039;t remember for shit.. and for the most part, they were re-occuring.. when i was a kid, in my dreams, it was always me in complete mayhem, either running, hiding, climbing or avoiding huge fucking tidal waves!! destruction, people in utter chaos!! roads in disarray, minor scuffles involving encounters with gun bearing wierdos.. madness i tell u!!<br />fast forward.. <br />in the midst of my drug induced lack of nightly dreams, i had a minor involvement with a married woman that landed me in bars (such a long story, u have no idea).. so after &#039;camp snoopy&#039; i had to stay sober for court n testing n shit.. the dreams came back with a fucking vengeance!! <br />i&#039;ll share the most memorable..<br />i was walking with a mass of people, everyone all depressed n shit.. just walking, like an exodus er something.. up and up this elevating windy road with mountains to the right and a cliff with the violent crashing ocean below to the left.. well, i had a loved one in one arm, like a wife or girlfriend and a young kid in the other, and she had a baby in her arm.. all of a sudden, extremely illuminating bursts of color over the ocean horizon.. the mass of people all staring stunned when just like that, i fucking swear to you, i felt and heard the goddamned deafening blast of burning hot fucking air.. i&#039;m telling you, I FELT IT!! the initial explosion was of such violent mass i can&#039;t even relay it verbally!! then we all stared as glowing things rose from the horizon towards the sky.. they would appear to rise, then fall far off in the distance.. but they soon started coming closer, and panic resumed.. i remember we all (my family i presumed) just huddled in like a group hug until i looked up and a fireball was right above growing in diameter.. i awoke around then..<br />well, to prevent a long story from becoming longer.. to me this is where it gets weird.. when shared with a reiki master, she told me that it was&nbsp; a memory of a future/ past event either in this life, past life, or the next that my soul can&#039;t let go of because of it&#039;s inherent intensity.. <br />well, about 10 years after that particular dream i now have two kids.. i shit you not, a young kid and a toddler!! you can&#039;t make this kinda shit up!! well, i guess you can, but this is buddha&#039;s honest truth!!<br />just thought i&#039;d share that with you all!!<br />peace

				Just so you guys know, I&#039;ve read every single one of these posts and I feel inclined to start a dream journal.<br /><br />For those of you who don&#039;t know, a dream journal is something you write in immediately when you wake up. Dreams fade very quickly when you wake up, so writing in your dream journal (as much detail as possible) allows you to anchor those memories in your mind. From what I hear, keeping a dream journal is one of the best ways to keep having memorable dreams, night after night.

				I once had a dream that I was a homeless ( but very well dressed ) vagrant in the nearest large city to my current residence, which was interesting and I will detail now:<br /><br />So the dream starts off and it&#039;s raining and I have an suit on, but it&#039;s a little bit rough for wear and I&#039;ve got a sorta five-o-clock shadow going and all that. I light up a cigarette and enter what looks to be a dilapidated old abandoned hotel in order to shield myself from the cold and rain, but to my surprise there was somebody at the front desk, a crone probably as old as the building itself, and she asks me if I need a place to stay, I explain that I have no money and she offers to put me up for a while if I take care of some things in the hotel for her. So naturally, being the smart, dapper young gentleman that the dream was portraying me as, I accept. <br /><br />This is when things start getting weird. The hotel isn&#039;t very tall, like a couple stories, more like an apartment complex at this point. But none of the rooms have doors, and looking inside I see either old people hooked up to IV&#039;s or people my age doing drugs in the rooms. I eventually get to the room I was supposed to be staying in, and to my surprise, there was a door there. So I open it up and am kinda taken aback because there&#039;s another guy in my room.<br /><br />Now that&#039;s not too weird in and of itself but I have to give some backstory : shortly before this dream I was in a polyamorous relationship with this girl as sorta just like a fuck buddy ( she thought of me as that, and I wound up falling in love with her which was a shitty move on my part ) and this other dude was her main squeeze. I mean we would have threesomes together, and me being bisexual it would be threesomes that would make Caligula shiver as all of us involved are absolutely, completely kinky in our sex lives. Would up getting broke up with &#039;cause her main guy wound up not liking me, and I took it pretty hard.<br /><br />Well the guy in my room was this other dude, and out the corner of my eyes I can see my ex and they come up and say hello like nothing&#039;s wrong and it&#039;s almost like I&#039;m a floating head watching all this because I know what&#039;s going on but I&#039;m just playing through the motions like I don&#039;t know who these people are, and we hit it off. They inform me that this was their room but that I could stay until another room opened up because there was a high turnover rate at this place. I didn&#039;t ask why.<br /><br />We engage in some kinky sex, but mid-fuck I close my eyes to enjoy myself with some mental imagery, and when I open them I&#039;m fucking the old lady from the front desk. And we&#039;re going at it like crazy, I&#039;m choking her and she&#039;s got to be at least 95+ years old but she&#039;s enjoying every minute of it. Then at the last minute as I orgasm I look down and the old lady has turned into my ex-girlfriend&#039;s other love interest and apparently I had been butt-fucking him and strangled him to death. I look over at my ex and start apologizing but she just shrugs.<br /><br />Then I open my eyes again and I&#039;m sitting next to her in what looks to be the same building, old, shitty, but it&#039;s like an old hospital waiting room sorta setup. All around us are people stuffing their arms with needles, old people having sex, old people connected to IV&#039;s looking morose, and I looked over to my ex and asked, &quot;Hey, what&#039;s going on here?&quot; and she chuckled and asked if I was serious, to which she replied &quot; Don&#039;t you know? This is where people go to die. Whether by illness, uncurable disease, or old age... this is the waiting room.&quot; It then dawned on me that I had something along the line of aids and I had just not thought about it. Just sorta popped in my brain, never having any of this explained during the dream, I just KNEW I had either HIV or AIDS or some sort of disease along those lines that would just make my life miserable, y&#039;know?<br /><br />I woke up with a cold sweat. That dream to this day makes ABSOLUTELY no sense to me. I remember all the fucking details of it down to the fact that when I entered my lodgings for the first time my ex was holding a cherry vanilla coke and I remember thinking &quot;How the fuck can anyone drink that fucking filth?&quot; hahahhaa. I had taken like 30 miligrams of melatonin the night before, so that could explain why I remember most of it... <br /><br />Hope some of ya&#039;ll find it interesting. I&#039;ve ruminated on it. Shit plays out like a David Lynch movie when I imagine the sequences of events in my head. I very rarely have dreams but boy, when I do, they fucking take the cake. Never make any goddamn sense.

Dreams fade very quickly when you wake up, so writing in your dream journal (as much detail as possible) allows you to anchor those memories in your mind. From what I hear, keeping a dream journal is one of the best ways to keep having memorable dreams, night after night.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am too lazy for that.&nbsp; I usually just think about it for a few minutes and try to fall asleep and recreate the dream,\m..

				While I&#039;m here in the thread, I&#039;ll detail another crazy dream that&#039;s a bit less morose for y&#039;all.<br /><br />Dream starts, I&#039;m walking through the forest with this princess and we&#039;re hitting it off, talkin&#039; and shit, and all of a sudden this GIANT fucking dragon appears, but it&#039;s friendly as fuck so we smoke weed with the dragon in this glen and I pass out and wake up to a bunch of rednecks and some motherfucker wholooks like a combination of colonel sanders and hank hill with a cowboy hat on and some random redneck accoutrement puffing on a cigar and he says &quot;heh heh heh, thanks for bringin&#039; &#039;em to us kid.&quot; and he hands me a hundred and I&#039;m only going to assume that 100 bucks was worth a lot in whatever twisted amalgam of a time period I was in because I was dumbfounded at what he had just done. But I don&#039;t want my new friends to get kidnapped so I hand him back the 100 and tell him I wont accept it, so one of his goons hits me in the face with a wooden baseball bat and I pass out.<br /><br />I wake up and over the course of a few minutes get my bearings and figure out which direction I need to travel in order to save the dragon and the princess, eventually arriving at what appears to be some mix between a cheap, dirty carnival ground and a gypsy campground. I can see the dragon directly in the center of the campground and stare at him, waiting for him to acknowledge he saw me, which he did. I then notice that the princess has spotted me as well, and move over to her.<br /><br />While I&#039;m moving, I hear the hank sanders DBZ-esque fusion man say something about &quot;For attempting to violating my daughter, I punish you to DEAF a hick hick hick ( this is supposed to be a redneck-y laugh ) and then I hear the princess let out a scream as two guys who apparently don&#039;t see me take her out to see her father. &quot;And for consortin&#039; and consolin&#039; and copulatin&#039; with this here dragon, I&#039;m gonna make you the one to kill &#039;im. &quot;<br /><br />So I was stuck in a situation but for some reason in the past ten to fifteen seconds two black carbon-steel katanas appeared on my back and I went on a rampage through the camp to get to the two, and I untied them as they had both been restrained.<br /><br />The last two hours of the dream was spent flying the dragon away from the rednecks with the princess, but we had to go through this precipice sorta deal where there were rednecks on either side of us shooting old like cartoonish looking cannonballs at us, but I manage to figure out how to make the dragon shoot fire so I kill all the sideliners and we land safely on the other side away from redneck territory, the dragon and princess kiss and the dream is over.

				Wavelength, I don’t know how you find the courage to share the things you do. :o I think I saw something else you wrote the other day in a different thread and I thought, how do they find the nerve to hit the Send button….? It isn’t easy…. <br /><br />RE your friend’s gf, common situation to be in, sometimes it can backfire but it seems it didn’t in your case. Hope you remain friends (or fuck-muffins) with them for some time. TY for sharing. I read it with enthusiasm as some of us can relate to that (and multiple occasions too) and reading your post triggered some memories for me, which I’ve been trying to forget about as past friends and lovers mean nothing to me after I hit the “delete account” button on their friendship. Just like SR, they don’t exist anymore when that happens.<br /><br />As for phucked ^ dreams, I shared that before lol (RE worked for Lim but he fired me when I made a suggestion on how to do run business differently, and was in ACE’s fortress of a house for some reason and Rox left door open after pizza was delivered and he called out SHUT THE FUCKING DOOR! Might point out, the cops had been trying to get into our house (yeah, I lived with them and stealth packeted the opium) and SWAT team had not been able to get in (ACE kept the door locked) so they were just camping outside our house trying to brainstorm a way to get in, and we were going great until Rox left the door open…….dreams are usually weird). :-\<br /><br />As for lucid dreaming, I have never done that properly. I have been able to control some dreams (how far up I fly before I fly too far and my superman cape either is blown away by the wind, plummeting me to the ground, or I fly too high ^ and get blown out of gravity and then can’t re-enter earth’s orbit…..both are scary). The superman dream is a common dream with a lot of people, if you ask around, which I admit I haven’t, but I have heard that it is common by a few people in convos so don’t see the need to ask around, just take it on faith. I think it has something to do with confidence levels. Anyway, proper lucid dreaming, at least I think, is where you go into it and COMPLETELY control the dream. Hmm, have you ever seen “The Cell”? I bought it because Jennifer Lopez was in it but it turned out to a half decent movie (or at least made you think a little), in which she tries to enter the mind of a serial killer via lucid dreams to “jog his memory” for him so to speak. Turn off the lights though; it’s better. (Also, have you ever seen Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith while drunk? First time I saw it I sneaked into the cinema pissed and the dogfight/lasers scene was amazing…. My head was spinning and then everything ON THE SCREEN started spinning too, eventually confused as to what was supposed to spin and what was not supposed to; it wasn’t too bad at all….. I went back next week with someone who didn’t come with us the first time sober as hell and it was rather disappointing.)<br /><br />You haven’t told us whether YOU have lucid dreamed though. ??? Have you/would you? Feel free to update if you have any more weird dreams.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105816.msg732884#msg732884">Quote from: kitkat82 on January 17, 2013, 05:16 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I had another dream that I was in a prison that was guarded by dinosaurs.&nbsp; I guess it was the future or something, because T Rex and all those Jurrasic park guys were everywhere.&nbsp; I managed to escape with the help of my dad, who came to visit and caused a distraction by screaming and throwing a fit.&nbsp; (The human security guards in the future are really bad).<br /><br />I got on a train and I forget some of the details after that, but it was pretty cool, I was hiding out in different train cars and almost getting caught every 5 seconds.&nbsp; I do remember waking up all panicked because I went to the conductor&#039;s cart and it was being driven by a Velociraptor wearing one of those train engineer striped hats, the actual conductor was ripped to shreds on the floor...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />God kitkat82..... wtf do you think about b4 going to bed in order to have these phucked ^ dreams?! :o roflmfao!
