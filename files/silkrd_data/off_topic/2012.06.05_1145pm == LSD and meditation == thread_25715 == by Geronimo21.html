				I am in possession of a few decent tabs, friends estimate their around 70mics and they&#039;ve collectively done acid 100&#039;s of times, but I&#039;ve also been practicing breathing meditation and kundalini meditation/yoga and was wondering have any of you meditated or done yoga on lsd, and if so whats it like, and is it useful for meditation and spiritual practices or is it just a recreational drug with little entheogenic capacity?

				Meditation on LSD is not only a fine idea, but is sometimes hard NOT to do.&nbsp; I&#039;ve only done acid with others, but I&#039;ve found that there&#039;s been a point in every trip when I have an urge to just close my eyes and be alone in my own head for a while.&nbsp; It&#039;s usually only several minutes realtime, but that can be a really long time in acid-time.&nbsp; One of the great things about LSD is that the trips are at least partly self-defining.&nbsp; If you want it to be entheogenic, it probably will be.&nbsp; If you want it to be frivolous, it almost surely will be.&nbsp; <br /><br />That said...&nbsp; I personally wouldn&#039;t try any _hard_ kundalini yoga postures on acid.&nbsp; I did kundalini in college and know a bit of what you&#039;re talking about.&nbsp; If you just want to do breath of fire or some squatting poses or something, knock yourself out, but one of the side effects of almost ANY kind of drug trip is a reduced awareness of your own limitations.&nbsp; LSD in particular makes it relatively easy to distort your sense of self; you might feel you have preternatural strength, or are made of rubber, or all your chakras are lighting up at once if that&#039;s what you WANT to feel. But of course it didn&#039;t change your body, just your mind. The risk of any intensive stretching posture is that you might stretch farther than you normally would and hurt yourself.<br /><br />Rule of thumb?&nbsp; Do anything you want to with your mind.&nbsp; Don&#039;t do anything with your body that isn&#039;t really easy and familiar for you.&nbsp; If in doubt, repeat to yourself &quot;I&#039;m tripping.&nbsp; My perception is amazing, but my judgment sucks.&quot;&nbsp; And you should be okay.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)

				You make a good point about the yoga, it probably isn&#039;t such a good idea considering the dangers of kundalini already but to misjudge your abilities on acid would make it even worse, Ill most likely stick to chakra meditation and hope I can advance my kundalini forward. Glad to hear it&#039;s a good mix, i&#039;ve been looking forward to a powerful and somewhat safer entheogen, thanks for the advice :)

				From what i have seen, an experienced meditator can intensify the effects of a typical LSD trip to a level that makes DMT seem like ginger beer.<br /><br />Be careful, Have Fun.

				I have been meditating for over a year completely sober (marijuana affects meditation btw) and all I can say is, it really works! I started meditating with 2c-i and all I can say is, wow! I meditate for two hours and then the 2c-i hits me and by then I&#039;m already paralyzed and in my consciousness, I normally walk into an empty room (in my mind of course) and can create whatever I want, kind of like a lucid dream. I recently did it with acid and it was very rewarding, I have expanding my mental capacities and have cured several of my anxiety issues so I would recommend this to any experienced psychedelic user.

				I&#039;ve been working on some musical meditation techniques myself, the circular breathing of a didgeridoo can be very conducive to meditation. And it wasn&#039;t until some recent experiments with throat singing on 25i-NBOMe that I managed to get the harmonics to ring out separately (it is a very magical experience to realize that you really are singing two notes at once whilst tripping face) I wasn&#039;t even sure whether or not it was real until i looked up and saw my girlfriend was in the room staring at me with utter shock.

This is also my technique to induce lucid dreaming and I would suggest anyone to try it out either sober or on a psychedelic such as LSD or 2c-i.

				I used a similar breathing method to when I was in jail as kid to escape from my reality and better contemplate my situation. Definitely makes the hours fly by.

				Amazing I&#039;m really looking forward to it now, hope I can intensify the effects to get a more powerful experience. I guess I&#039;m not the only who sometimes gets paralyzed meditating interesting, do you guys also get involuntary movements occasionally?

				yea, I think the twitching thing is pretty common. Its analogous to the sparks you get while trying to hotwire a car (just a side-effect from basically trying to wire the brain/car in a way that it&nbsp; wasn&#039;t necessarily made to).

				It&#039;s like how they say yoga was originally invented to supplement Marijuana. The positions actually make you higher and relax deeply.&nbsp; :P

				LSD can b great for lying back on a bed and closing your eyes and seeing all manner of visions an feeling like flying.<br /><br />Better still camp oit way away from anyone. <br /><br />Some night.<br /><br />alone I done this and with a women also ans friends.<br /><br />Outside it has to be a nice evening. Tripping in torrential rain is not&nbsp; good.<br /><br />Meditate, watch the stars, The sky. Close your eyes. Feel yourself become as one.
