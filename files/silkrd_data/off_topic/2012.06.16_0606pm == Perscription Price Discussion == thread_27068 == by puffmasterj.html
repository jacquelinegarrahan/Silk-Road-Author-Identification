				I&#039;ve noticed on here the cost pf prescription painkillers and adderal are much, much higher than in my state. Granted, my state has one of the highest prescription abuse rates in the country, which may lead to higher volume then lower cost of these drugs. I&#039;m just wondering why such a HUGE discrepancy in cost. I hope somebody can help me understand why this is.<br /><br />In my area, 10 mg Norco - $4 to 5<br />In my area, 20 mg adderal - $2 <br /><br />On here I have seen each of these go for $15 or more a pop. Any idea&#039;s? Thanks!

				I want an answer to this as well.<br /><br />When I had connects I got 10mg Hydro&#039;s for $5. 10mg Perc&#039;s for $6. These were american prescriptions made by american companies.<br /><br />Yet people here sell pills from overseas, no name (or unknown or respected here in the states) brands and charge us double what they cost on the street. <br /><br />I suppose cops are more interested in finding pill vendors due to the volume they can distribute but 50mg&#039;s of hydro for like $80 is way too much. That&#039;s a $30 markup on top of shipping.<br /><br />I suppose that buying pills flat out is more expensive to a vendor then selling your own prescription which is funded mostly by medical. But that cost is even higher, just not at the moment of purchase for the prescription.<br /><br />I love to dabble with painkillers every now and then but I couldn&#039;t afford to order ANY of these besides methadone which is not even a good opiate feeling. I&#039;m better off making poppy tea and benefiting my local GFS, though I&#039;d much prefer to send my money to one of you all, if the price is right.
