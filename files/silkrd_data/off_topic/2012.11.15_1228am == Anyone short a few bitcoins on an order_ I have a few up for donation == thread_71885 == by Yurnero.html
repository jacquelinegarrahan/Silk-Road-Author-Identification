I need to order Dexedrine IR tablets which I take in addition to a prescribed therapeutic dose on days where the Vyvanse wears off too early and am just .2 btc away from being able to place my order.

				I could really use .3 bitcoins. I was so excited that SR was back up I sent my coins but apparently I can&#039;t math and thought I was going to end up with 7 in my account, but I only have 6.3. The lovely and very nice vendor Novartis agreed to cut me a deal on shipping but it still comes to 6.6. I am totally out of MMJ and super sad about it, have really missed the Road during these past few days! My username is the same as on SR. <br /><br />Even if I don&#039;t qualify, thanks for offering, and e-hugs all around!&nbsp; :-*
