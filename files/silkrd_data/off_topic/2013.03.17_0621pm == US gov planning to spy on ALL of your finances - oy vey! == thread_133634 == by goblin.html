				As if we needed more evidence of Obama&#039;s fascist police state in the making:<br /><br />http://rt.com/usa/us-spy-financial-records-246/<br /><br />US plans to allow spy agencies to monitor every citizen’s finances – report<br /><br />Reuters / Heinz-Peter Bader<br /><br />Washington is reportedly considering opening all US financial records to national intelligence agencies in order to prevent future crimes. Only the FBI has had unlimited access to such databases; other agencies had to file case-by-case requests.<br /><br />The Obama administration is preparing legislation to enable the country’s numerous security and intelligence agencies to spy on the accounts of US citizens, Reuters has revealed. The scheme’s stated aim is to help to identify and track terrorist cells, expose money-laundering schemes, trace criminal syndicates and curb corruption.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s a war on money, war on corruption, on politically exposed persons, anti-money laundering, organized crime,&quot; Amit Kumar, the UN advisor on Taliban and a fellow at the Democrat-established Center for National Policy think tank told Reuters.<br /><br />The plan, dated March 4, is in its early stages but appears to have no judicial obstacles, as US legislation does not prohibit the exchange of information between government bodies. However, human rights activists have already criticized the plan<br /><br />The planning document obtained by Reuters that the US Treasury’s financial database, which previously was only fully accessible by the FBI, will soon be integrated with national criminal, intelligence and other databases&nbsp; to become accessible to “law enforcement, counter-terrorism agencies, financial regulators and the intelligence community.”<br /><br />Today, the US Treasury&#039;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) does not only collect data on clients of financial institutions, it also gathers reports of so-called ‘suspicious client activity’.<br /><br />An estimated 25,000 financial institutions operating inside US territory – like banks, money transfer agencies, securities dealers and casinos – are obliged to report any activity considered suspicious, such as large (over $10,000) cash transfers,&nbsp; strangely account structures, computer hacking, counterfeiting and suspected money laundering.<br /><br />The system is arranged so that if a bank is revealed to have not reported its clients’ suspicious activities, it risks of paying severe fines. Many banks err on the side of caution, and file reports on any activity deemed even slightly unusual: Every year, 15 million ‘suspicious activity reports’ are filed to the US Treasury, which allocates considerable resources to deal with them all.<br /><br />If the Obama administration’s financial spy plan is enacted, US government agencies will have access to virtually all financial information on citizens or foreigners doing business in the US.<br /><br />Currently, investigating a financial crime involves unraveling a tangle of evidence that could lead to a certain person, such as demanding a specific financial dossier from FinCEN. Once agencies like CIA, NSA or Counter Terrorism Center are allowed unrestricted access to FinCEN data, it would become possible for them to target an individual and arrest them for a crime for which they are not currently under investigation.<br /><br />A US Treasury spokesperson vowed the agencies will adhere to safeguards outlined in both the Bank Secrecy Act and the US PATRIOT Act: “Law enforcement and intelligence community members with access to this information are bound by these safeguards.”<br /><br />But Michael German, the senior policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Reuters that “the intelligence community simply ignores the rules” when it comes to how sensitive information is used.<br /><br />German recalled Congress had refused to approve a similar plan a decade ago, but now “the guidelines were subsequently loosened… It’s in a black hole.”<br /><br />‘Citizens caught up in financial crosshairs’<br /><br />The new plan will do little in increasing the efficacy of “keeping America safe,” while potentially increasing, at least partially, the risk of an innocent or “wrongly-profiled” individual being caught through a misreading of banking information, Margaret Bogenrief, a founding partner of ACM Partners financial advisory firm told RT.<br /><br />“The continued efforts to &#039;keep its citizens safe,&#039; the US government seems be to struggling to walk that line between protection and invasion of American citizens’ privacy,” Bogenrief said. “More citizens could end up being caught up in the financial crosshairs.”<br /><br />Considering that financial institution are already over-reporting on questionable activity this new plan of enforcement and power “almost guarantees an abuse, whether intentional or not,” she added.<br /><br />The true unintended tragedy of this plan is that it won’t bring a significant increase in arrests of high-profile criminals, Bogenrief believes.<br /><br />“Truly sophisticated criminals – whether they be members of organized crime, gangs, or terrorist groups – will already have the structures and teams in place that will assist these criminal groups in both skirting these rules and avoiding prosecution.”<br /><br />The Obama administration’s financial spying plan is a shocking attack on personal freedom, independent journalist and founder of Wide Awake News, Charlie McGrath says.<br /><br />“Sold as an effort to stop international terror groups, the proposed measure pushes us ever closer to a complete Orwellian Police State where you are guilty without cause, evidence, or even accusation,” McGrath told RT.

				Good read, but are we still really surprised by news like this? Do any of us actually believe we have complete and open freedom? It&#039;s delusions like this that have allowed the Government to grow into this grotesque form uninhibited. This is the age of uncertainty and chaos, and the irony is that WE (America the beautiful) are the proponents of this chaos. Because where there is unrest, we put our unwanted foot in the door in the name of establishing DEMOCRACY! It&#039;s no coincidence Israel is our greatest ally in the Mid-East and South Korea in Asia. Don&#039;t get me started on the Iraq war. Then our &#039;leaders&#039; are aghast when these 3rd World nations react in the manner that they do towards our incessant meddling, North Korea I&#039;m looking at you, and we condemn and impose sanctions to further sever ties, yet diplomacy has always been the United States&#039; main objective. /rollseyes I guess that&#039;s what the 2,000 or so nukes waiting at the ready are for, right?<br /><br />Not a damn &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;terrorist&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; attack on our soil in the last 10 years, yet surveillance is at an all-time high and seeing no end. The heavy Marxist influences in the West are really beginning to become apparent now more than ever.<br /><br />Sorry I got off track and ranted a little bit, but I really despise where this country is headed. The sad part is the majority of the population is too dependent on the system to make a difference. Can anyone tell me the definition of insanity?

				Hopefully this drives more bitcoin adoption.<br /><br />The best thing that can happen to bitcoin is it becomes too big to fail. Like the banks that launder billions for drug cartels, if bitcoin is adopted by tens of millions of people and a multi-billion dollar economy develops, they won&#039;t be able to prosecute people for using it.<br />

				Great read. Thank you! Just say the T word, and you have carte blanche to do as you please in America nowadays.<br /><br />I do have to say that every time I ready a tin hat article like this, I have to point out that even though the government has all these obscene powers, &quot;criminals&quot; are still very unlikely to be caught and when they are caught it is usually due to the criminals own stupidity, not the government exercising extraordinary police powers. I sometimes think even when the government has the power to inspect your underwear, they are so incompetent that you can still get away with pretty much everything. The only people who can&#039;t get away with stuff...the normal citizenry who gets caught in the drag net. But that&#039;s kind of the point isn&#039;t it.

				The criminal serving in lieu of a leader (obama) doesn&#039;t want any competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;By signing&nbsp; the NDAA and attempting to give its unconstitutional provisions the force of law, Barack Hussein Obama became complicit with all of the bought-and-paid-for U.S. Senators and Representatives who voted for this bill, and along with them should be charged with Seditious Conspiracy under U.S. Code Title 18 Part I Chapter 115 Section 2384. Unless and until they are arrested, charged and removed from office, I will no longer consider the government they infest to be legitimate. Nor will I respect any ruling to the contrary from a judicial system that grants rights of citizenship to corporate entities that treat settlements and penalties for criminal conduct as costs of doing business with no concerns about incarceration or execution to deter their illegal, immoral or unethical conduct.<br /><br />- I&#039;m a Sovereign Citizen, currently living in a Marxist occupied America. <br /><br />The damage done by Obama and his minions is so vast, it&#039;s almost impossible to measure. Kind of like the Obamacare bill. As Nancy &quot;psycho&quot; Pelosi explained. &quot;You have to pass it to find out what&#039;s in it&quot;<br />So basically the House+Senate &#039;Finalized Early&#039;.<br /><br />&nbsp;In 2008 then &#039;candidate&#039; (if you still believe we have real elections) Obama said referring to Bush, &quot; adding $4 trillion in debt was irresponsible and &quot;unpatriotic.&quot;<br /><br />Flash-forward and you&#039;ll find new debt from just one Obama term was almost twice as much as a full 8 years of President Bush. <br /><br />Hypocrisy, passing the buck and blaming others is also unpatriotic, right, Mr. President? Maybe it&#039;s time you lived up to your own words?<br /><br />You won&#039;t hear anyone in the media hammering Obama on his disassembling of our nation, in what can only be a slow communist takeover. Nobody want&#039;s to end up like that poor fellow at CNBC.<br /><br />CNBC gave some mainstream attention to the largest money laundering and racketeering lawsuit in United States History, in which “Banksters” and their U.S. racketeering partners are accused of laundering of 43 trillion dollars worth of ill gotten gains. The lawsuit is said to involve officials located in the highest offices of government and the financial sector. <br /><br />Since this information was surprisingly revealed by the mainstream news organization there has been a very suspicious and deadly fallout at the CNBC headquarters. Within hours the original page for the article was taken down, and CNBC senior vice president Kevin Krim received news that his children were killed under very suspicious circumstances. It seems that the murder happened first and then the page was removed later.<br /><br />Mob hit. Chicago style?&nbsp; Only now the Mob Thugs are in the White House, and have Psy Ops at their disposal. Drones spying on Americans. - Can it get any worse? <br /><br />Yes it can. . . . . . .and it will!<br /><br />Enjoy your &#039;Hope and Change&#039; fools!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				This is why I pay with cash or a prepaid debit card. Though, not sure where they are as far as the prepaids go? <br /><br />Not surprising, though. Government is always gong to mess with us. There&#039;s nothing we can do, really. Short of getting together, rushing them and then lynching their asses.

				Add this fact to the equation. These Fascists that want to take guns away from law abiding citizens, are arming themselves to the teeth, and guess how they describe THEIR guns??<br /><br />While Americans are being browbeaten with rhetoric about the necessity to give up semi-automatic firearms in the name of preventing school shootings, the federal government is arming itself to the teeth with both ammunition and guns. Last September, the DHS purchased no less than 7,000 fully automatic assault rifles, labeling them “Personal Defense Weapons.”<br /><br />There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Sandy Hook School Shooter. Just surf Youtube. So far the Gov&#039;t-Media-Industrial Complex hasn&#039;t gotten to them, YET.<br />It was another psy ops job IMHO. The speeches given almost immediately seemed just a little too well written and timed. Though the majority of the zombie-prozac nation didn&#039;t notice. <br />Everyone reacted. Knee-jerk of course. - Ooohh guns are baaaaaaaddd!! - Yes that is the popular opinion. Most dummies don&#039;t want to appear unpopular, so they form a thoughtless opinion to &quot;fit in&quot;<br />It&#039;s called &quot;group think&quot;<br /><br />Recent Headline;<br />&quot;The Department of Homeland Security is set to purchase a further 21.6 million rounds of ammunition to add to the 1.6 billion bullets it has already obtained over the course of the last 10 months alone, figures which have stoked concerns that the federal agency is preparing for civil unrest&quot;<br /><br />Hint: See &quot;Insurrection&quot; - the definition. - I&#039;d tell you but it helps you to learn if you look it up! To those that already know, my apologies, getting a little pissed off here. <br /><br />The insatiable appetite for power and money will continue unabated within our government, as is the nature of humankind..<br /><br />We won&#039;t be the the first civilization to disappear. Many have come and gone before us. Some only recently discovered, that existed long before Moses. <br /><br />I used to think national pride, patriotism, doing the right thing, etc..&nbsp; would keep us safe. Now I only see history repeating itself. <br /><br />It&#039;s going to get ugly. Might as well do all the drugs you can, and have that emergency stash for when things get rough. <br /><br />That&#039;s my plan. - also a loaded 9mm. Whomever comes to round us up, is losing at least one goonsquad member. I&#039;m taking one of them with me.&nbsp; ;D
