				by sending them $100-$200 worth of drugs in a way that the drugs would most certainly be intercepted and a CD would occur, what would be the best (worst ) drugs to buy for the situation. I&#039;m not an evil person, its just that someone owes me money and im not trying to go through the trouble of an assault charge. This person probably has illicit substances or paraphernalia at the residence as well!

				You can&#039;t lie, it&#039;d be funny enough to bring tears to the eyes if OP followed through hoping the person gets arrested for the delivery and the person actually received all the drugs with no problem. I can only imagine the expression on their face opening up a box, explore the contents only to find quite the party pack with no idea where it came from or why.

				what do u guys think would get the most attention: excess stamps, bulging letter, coffee grinds, a corner of it is wet, handwritten but with a buisness return address? ive decided what to do, this dude slowed up operations for a bit, now its his turn to feel bad about the dope game.

				You have told us the amount stolen, that the thief was male, your proposed method of revenge, and the value of the drugs being sent. You haven&#039;t told us how many of his friends are members of this forum.

				what if the package doesnt get CD&#039;d? then this person just gets free dugs? i would try to be more clever, although i dont have quite the answer<br /><br />i have a &#039;friend&#039; of a friend, who developed an oxy addiction and went on to steal 5k from my friend, as well as 5-10k from another &#039;friend&#039;/her bf, and it goes on a bit...but the 5k to my friend hits closest. she outright lied about stupid shit (mom has cancer, mom has this, lost my job, lost my job again), and unfortunately my friend fell for it for too long before she realized what was up.<br /><br />I&#039;m also open to ideas to &#039;mess up someones day&#039;
