				http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1254<br /><br />HR 1254 just passed the house.<br /><br />It bans all of the RCs except for the expensive, super-new RCs like 4-ACO-DMT,4-HO-DIPT, and most importantly the NBOme series.<br /><br />This is a big blow to RCs and hopefully this bill will get bogged down in the Senate. I am still going to be able to source my chems without a problem because I deal directly with manufacturers but all online RC vendors will be shut down. <br /><br />I feel like this will bring more demand to SR to fill the void as it will no longer be &quot;grey market&quot; to sell these RCs.<br /><br />What do you guys think about this. Scheduling is going to drive the prices up for all these chems, although I don&#039;t know how much or in how long because JWH-018 is still opening sold on the grey market even though it has been banned since March.

				Actually already posted this here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6679.0<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t matter. We can use this thread.<br /><br />&quot;<br />Not that it&#039;s going to have any effects on distribution, but it might bring up the prices on RC&#039;s for at least a little while. Some good news is that it seems the bill has been postponed some. Thought you all would be interested.<br />&quot;<br />&quot;<br />To be completely honest I don&#039;t see how this is going to affect distribution too much. Many of the china pharms. will ship regulated chemicals to the U.S. as it stands. Some bill isn&#039;t going to stop them unless their own government does--that is, a chemical controlled in china will not be, and isn&#039;t currently shipped.<br />&quot;<br />

And Foxy and T7 are ridiculously more expensive and harder to find than other Chemicals. <br /><br />It is just a series of developments that must be considered by any RC dealer. Methylone, 4-FMC, and Meow have been illegal in Florida since last Spring Break.
