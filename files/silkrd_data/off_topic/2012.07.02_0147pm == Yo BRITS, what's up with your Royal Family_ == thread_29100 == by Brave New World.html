				This old hag has been plastered all over our TV for the last year with the Prince&#039;s wedding and then her 80th birthday.<br />It is very ironic for Americans to idolize the Royal Family for obvious reasons. Sometimes I find it hysterical, other times I go nuts.<br />But yeah, if you Brits didn&#039;t know, the media out here loves William and Kate. Kate is on the female networks every 5 fucking minutes.<br />She ain&#039;t no Princess Diana, that&#039;s for damn sure. But you wouldn&#039;t know if your wife made you turn on Channel E.<br /><br />Then two weeks ago you Brits are celebrating the Queen&#039;s 80th birthday. My friends and I were all watching in utter amazement. It was like North Korea when Kim Jung Il died.<br />All those dumb ass boats going down the Thames. You guys are as crazy as Americans.<br />The best part was the concert for the Queen. Like her ass wants to listen to Will.I.Am at 10:3O at night.<br /><br />So I just wanted to know from the Brits whats your opinion of the Royal Family and all those over-the-top celebrations?

				hahahahah, i set that concert to record for the hell of it and was thinking the same thing. though i only watched bits of it, fastforwarded through most of it. it&#039;s so funny to watch the royal family sitting in that special box, like, what are they doing? what are they chatting about? if it was me i&#039;d be like lol look at me i&#039;m in a box haw haw HAW i&#039;m elite <br /><br />but i digress, i am australian. <br />&gt;.&gt;<br />&lt;.&lt;

				Kappacino, seconded bro!! 8)<br />Even if she is doing it for the publicity status, my shame would go right out the window if it were me.&nbsp; I wouldnt kick her out of bed!<br /><br />Seriously, i had to laugh at this thread.&nbsp; Most americans dont realize the queens relationship with the forces, or their combined histories.&nbsp; After all, its called The Royal Army duh.<br />Americans only react to our treatment of the queen because they have nothing like that.&nbsp; I mean, no one says anything about the unbeliveably massive security that turns up on the presidents inauguration day.&nbsp; Fuck me, now that shit makes me cringe.<br />At least here there is a lot of history behind our armed forces.&nbsp; Also do not forget, the queen enlisted in the army to do her part, when she was young, because she has great respect for them.<br />Thats why the army go all out for her, its mutual respect.&nbsp; How many presidents can be respected in exactly the same way?, by that i mean world wide, not just america.

				Limitless, the people who make posts like this are probably the kind who think we brits would not have won the war if it were not for the good ole us of a.<br />And, before anyone responds to that, america only got involved because of pearl harbor and they actually charged us for them helping.&nbsp; We only stopped paying off the monies owed in the last decade.&nbsp; Can you believe that shit?

				Adasel: Truth, and most Americans think were the shit, too bad were not, but at least you aren&#039;t in Japans shoes, they&#039;re stripped of an offensive military and are basically under US control, not to mention we even forced them to change their flag.

				Thanks guys.<br />Well tbh, i think even after all this time the japs and the krouts still have to be kept an eye on.<br />Not sure if americans know this (hehe) but germany has no official army, not allowed.&nbsp; Thats why when you hear an ex british army talk about his experiences he more or not mentions being stationed in germany.<br />Having said that, i didnt know about the japanese flag thing.<br />

				I was just going to say mate, have you seen an old movie called The Odessa File.<br />Basically it stars a very young John Voigt (sp?)&nbsp; and he is recruited by the cia to infiltrate a group of ex krout Nazis who are planning to bring germany to power again, starting by sending missles into israel.<br />If you havnt seen it its well worth watching and very believable, it could happen anywhere!!!

				The Royal Family are nice enough people. I just disagree with the fact that democracy can be overruled just because you happen to come out the right vagina, and then when anyone questions it you can just say it&#039;s shiny and brings in money and that&#039;s okay. They&#039;re so outdated it&#039;s unreal we consider ourselves a leading nation in the world and still have a system with hereditary privilege.<br /><br />The worst thing is that things like the Royal Wedding and Jubilee make us so proud of having them. I think it&#039;s more likely we&#039;ll decriminalize drugs in our lifetime than abolish the Royal family.

				If you&#039;re feeling patriotic watch the Battle of Britain with Michael Cain. That shit will make you want to join the air force<br /><br />Its kind of a shame aerial combat has progressed to the point it has now.. where you can just take something out from afar. Obviously with the advent of modern technology that was always going to happen but there&#039;s something majestic about a real dogfight. Two men and their machines, toiling it out in the open sky, trying to out maneuver each other, trying to get the angle on each other.. <br /><br />What a sight to behold. Its an unfortunate business war, but its grand nonetheless.&nbsp; <br /><br />Contrast that with missile lock-on, drone strikes etc etc. I prefer the old style where it was man vs man to the death

				Kappacino i havnt seen that but i will definately check it out mate.&nbsp; <br />As for air combat, things have progressed.&nbsp; OF course its not what it used to be.&nbsp; Imagine going up there in a spitfire and only having a compass, map bearings and your eyes to look out for landmarks.<br />That would scare the shit out of me personally.<br />But, yeah of course they could have been regarded more as heroes those days.<br />These days, planes we have are more flown by computers and electronics as opposed to the pilot being in control.<br />

She is a FIGUREHEAD and that is it. She represents us by meeting world leaders on good-will trips and does charity work and that&#039;s about it lol. She has about as much to do with actually running the country as I do lol. Totally ceremonial.<br /><br />I mean if the Queen had any power at all I&#039;d agree with you wholeheartedly, but she don&#039;t lol. No Monarch really has for about 150 odd years. What she does have is a lot of respect, which is a completely different kettle of fish.

				I wouldn&#039;t say she&#039;s powerless, personally.&nbsp; The military pretty much belongs to her, and all soldiers are indoctrinated with the whole &quot;alleigence to the queen&quot; doctrine. She still has fingers in a lot of pies, and is far from a harmless old lady.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to get all tinfoil hat, but I wouldn&#039;t fuck with her, that&#039;s for sure.&nbsp; :-X

				kryptoz, i know what you are saying bro and sorry if i took your message the wrong way.<br />Even i would love that kind of security.&nbsp; However, being in the public eye 24/7 like that?, no thanks, fuck that shit.<br />I remember Antonio Banderas being on a chat show here in the uk some time back.&nbsp; He said that the paparazzi would deliberately leave bits of broken glass on their lawns, so that when the kids come out bare footed they could take shoots on them hurting themselves.<br />Seriously, thats probably half the reason of the security.
