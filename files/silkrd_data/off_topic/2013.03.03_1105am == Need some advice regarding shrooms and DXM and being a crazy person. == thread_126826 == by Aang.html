				Hi,<br /><br />Not to sound preachy but,&nbsp; &nbsp;First:&nbsp; DXM is not a recreational drug.&nbsp; It&#039;s effects are caused by poisoning yourself basically .&nbsp; Just because its has a three letter acronym doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s like LSD.&nbsp; It&#039;s sold a cough medicine for a reason.&nbsp; Abusing it will lead to unpredictable results each time.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m know yu are young and I was too.&nbsp; &nbsp;DXM is the new Sniffing gas or Pam like in my day.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use real drugs as hey are safer .&nbsp; Your liver with thank yu for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do a google search sometime on dxm and liver. <br /><br />I too suffer from anxiety, but that wasn&#039;t your problem. You just offset your chemistry for a while by poisons g yourself with over the counter shit.&nbsp; They put stuff In That to make you sick to discourage you from trying it again.<br /><br />If u need need scoring something good,&nbsp; just MSG me .&nbsp; I&#039;d rather give you some safe drugs for free than see you do this to yourself. Fuck, don&#039;t use RC &#039;s either&nbsp; !&nbsp; &nbsp;They suck and why be a lab rat?<br /><br />What u need for anxiety and disorder is probably seroquel or Abilify or some general antipsychotic.&nbsp; Supliment with Ativan or valium / mild benzo.&nbsp; mild is key, as you only need a tiny amount to function and panick attacks will be treated properly.&nbsp; Don&#039;t self-medicate this one. . .&nbsp; Ask your doctor for help, I did and I&#039;m glad .&nbsp; Now I get benzos, sleeping pills and pain meds just for asking .&nbsp; All free .&nbsp; You could too.&nbsp; Why suffer?.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are plenty of safe drugs here and experienced people to help you stay safe .&nbsp; Ask, ask -ask.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />Some things are best left to a doctor.&nbsp; Get to one and get this treated.&nbsp; It will get worse with any doubt. You will end up hiding in the house and never going out. A disaccosiative like DXM junk.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Shrooms sad to say really offsets your serotonin and could even alter yur hormones and other brain chems for a while.&nbsp; This is something that will make your condition agitated.&nbsp; Use real LSD or ketamine if you really want a trip that won&#039;t bother you much. <br /><br />&nbsp;Also,&nbsp; for you always have a panick disorder kit on you.&nbsp; ( Valium/Ativan and zyprexa /seroquel). These will stop a psycotic episode or bad trip or panick attack dead in its tracks.&nbsp; This is what they will give you if u went to the hospital tripping out or panicking . <br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />

				I think lower dosages of mushrooms in a controlled enviroment could be quite helpful. but I am no doctor. Subduing symptoms with benzos seems like short term solution, while shrooms or LSD might help you find the problems in your psyche and unravel them. Could go complete shit, but it shouldn&#039;t :)

				Hi Jedi, Thanks very much for the sentiment and kind words but the DXM trip was more than ten years ago now! My panic disorder has more or less resolved itself and I am in a good state of mind, but once again, thank you very much for the kind words. Could you elaborate on the &quot;panic kit&quot;, I have valium which I use recreationally with cannabis but only once every 3-4 weeks. But know nothing about zyprexa/seroquel, I shall do some research.<br /><br />I wish this forum had existed ten years ago however, I hid the symptoms from my family when I probably could have just gone to the hospital and had treatment.<br /><br />My question was more related to what the risks are with shrooms given my history.<br /><br />Badniff: Cheers for the words of encouragement!

				mdma would probably benefit you greatly. might want to give that a try before mushrooms. before going the pharmaceutical route, you should try things like kratom or kava for your anxiety. they could potentially help you a lot. :)
