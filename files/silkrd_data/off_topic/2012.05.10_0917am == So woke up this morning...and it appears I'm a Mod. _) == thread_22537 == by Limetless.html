				You are probs the most active person on here.<br /><br />It&#039;s gonna be alot better than Nomads once every 3 week appearance (no offense LOL). <br /><br />The only down side is that this is a tor forum and you can&#039;t really ban anyone for good. Mister Dank&#039;s troll/fag brigade will be here indefinitely. Hopefully he&#039;ll get some ball hair before the next full moon and take a long hard look in the mirror and decide to be a real person.

				This is exactly what we needed after all the BS piling up on the forums lately.A mod who is a respected vendor(I have personally sampled his wares,mmmm 4-aco),knows his way around currency and seems to have a fair amount of knowledge about counter surveillance.....not to mention a fervent hatred for trolls.There is hope after all for the forums.

				Way to go limetless.&nbsp; You&#039;re a great addition to a team I already admire.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know if people always realize how lucky we are to have you&nbsp; all here...if not this forum would go downhill quickly, ruined by trolls and scammers.&nbsp; You answered questions for me when I was confused over btc/money issues, and I thought you were levelheaded when most of us were ranting and raving about the latest H scammer, so they picked you wisely, you&#039;re joining a good crew, and I wish you good fortune in this as in other areas.<br />pbb

				Opi--Do you oppose ChronicPain&#039;s position as well? Just wondering. I&#039;m not sure if he was a vendor or a moderator first, to be honest.<br /><br />What about nomad bloodbath&#039;s non-drug listings that pop up on occasion? Is that okay?<br /><br />Or, would it be acceptable for other moderators to be vendors so long as they use a different handle? I&#039;m just trying to better understand what exactly you take issue with here. <br /><br />Not trying to be antagonistic or anything...I&#039;m genuinely curious about your reasoning. :)

				think about if tony76 was a mod...<br /><br />imagine how many people he could of selectively scammed and when they posted in forums deleted all of the posts that were negative towards him...<br />it basically give them the power to remove anything that is negative towards them.

				Mods being vendors is not a problem unless they use their mod powers like a certain Opana vendor and make their products sticky threads in a section.&nbsp; Just so it&#039;s on the front page everyday.
