				Hey,<br /><br />Anyone ever go onto OVDB?<br /><br />The word on there is one of the big vendors Enelysion (Spelling?) has got busted and is in jail. Also no sign of Admin for a few weeks and another of the main vendors Tarpaulin has been MIA for the last few weeks (Back now I think) with orders not getting sent etc.<br /><br />I always thought that Enelysion was heading that way maybe as he had a shitload of stock listed but still seems sketchy to me. Anyone know anything? <br /><br />REM

				I don&#039;t think cops plan on busting customers either, but I do think anyone who bought from ene recently should watch out. I think he deleted the old stuff, but when the cops busted him there were a bunch of address labels printed. Depending on the size of your order, you could still be watched. They may not want you right away, but they know you&#039;re involved and will try to use you to find bigger fish. Or there&#039;s always the mass bust angle. Sometimes if they can&#039;t bust a the big guys, a bunch of small time dealers busted at once can still make a good headline. (And yes, whether you&#039;re dealing or not, the quantities he sold at could easily be construed as &quot;intent to distribute&quot;)<br /><br />My point is: Don&#039;t freak out or anything, but if you were one of those people, I&#039;d definitely clear house. Doesn&#039;t hurt to be on the safe side.

				honestly from what i hear Ene had shit happen to him IRL is the reason why he was busted, and his girl completely spilled the beans on EVERYTHING, always remember to deny deny deny if it aint the feds on your ass then you have nothing to worry about regular police officers go to school for one year out of high school then on the academy, if your educated at all keep your damn mouth zipped up and get your lawyer but also make sure you portray innocence that you have NO clue why they are there, its going to take a while so expect to be with police officers all day or even longer but most of all NEVER TALK its innocence until proven guilty so always stay 2 steps ahead of the pigs and life will be dandy if your freaking out about having grams n shit on you i would suggest to stay inside or grow a set nothing is wrong til they got dirt on you or if your caught red handed/ratted on, honestly people that know about SR shouldnt even be telling anyone that they know about it, ya its cool to brag that your buying drugs via online but your doing something ILLEGAL, the way i see it if you cant keep a secret the person you told sure as hell wont either, and its only a matter of time before kids that are young find out about sites like this and then theres the real reason to have federal agents/CIA/ATF any 3 letter police agency who actually have some education behind their back, my 2cents,<br />TLDR: ene got caught due to his bitch laying out their life to the feds and she still has a conviction over her head, KEEP SR A SECRET!!! just wait til 15 year olds are on this site and then theres reason for federalies to bring down SR and sites like it

It&#039;s inevitable. Look at how quickly it has spread in only the last few months.

				honestly it may be safe&quot;&quot;&quot; for them but think about what your saying a 15 year old who can access this site is open to buying any type of narcotic offered yes its inevitable but people who spread the word about SR to anyone and everyone is an idiot, your doing something illegal and it will be only a matter of time before the wrong person hears do you think the parents of said 15 year old shooting up, snorting coke, tripping ballsack is going to sit there quietly? its been on the news and shit yes but the fact of the matter is it still in infant stages and already has unwanted attention from the like, i want to see SR be on here for as long as it can and spreading the word about something like this will surely end that, if you do some research there have been predecessor sites like this in which were brought down and the past tends to repeat itself, you should honestly consider it a gift that you found a site like this so why give it to anyone? if someone wanted you could easily supply your area with some of the vendors on here so why give up something that could ultimetly make you money? many reasons why to keep SR a secret yet many decide to boast about how cool it is buying on the internet,&nbsp;

Why do you think government is so powerful? It&#039;s because they continuously grow and hire more employees to join their ranks. If we stay small we will be sitting ducks. Do you not suppose LE are thinking up attack plans to take this site out? You think if we have 2000 members as opposed to 8000 members they will leave us alone? As we speak they are figuring out who is involved in running the site and when they find out they will use every dirty tactic possible to disrupt his/their lives, financially and socially. Governments have deep pockets, we&#039;re talking about billions, so SR is going to need a lot of $$$ if it wants to continue on. That $ is going to come from an expanding user base. We must rely on spreading the word about SR, and influencing as many people as possible to join our team. Because chances are if you are not in favor of freedom, then you are in favor of oppression.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">you should honestly consider it a gift that you found a site like this so why give it to anyone?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Because I am not selfish.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">many decide to boast about how cool it is buying on the internet</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Are you saying it&#039;s not cool?

Even if you are 100% certain your customers are honest people with no intention to harm, you never know who they&#039;ll talk to thinking its innocent banter. People talk and then people who shouldn&#039;t know where you get your supply know. <br /><br />2.) You don&#039;t tell customers who you buy from locally, do you? (&quot;Mike, down the block, 123 Main St. 555-BUY-BUDS, just tell him Tim sent you!&quot;) They&#039;re your customers, not your sources&#039; customers. As a general rule, if you have no reason to share information about your business, don&#039;t.<br /><br />3.) Honestly, friendships fall apart and you really don&#039;t need people having something over your head.<br /><br />I hate seeing people go to jail who aren&#039;t doing anything immoral (and I think we all agree on the morality of drug selling here ;)). Paranoia is a positive. Just because you&#039;re paranoid doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re wrong and hell, even if you are and none of the people you tell this to will ever rat you out or try to hold it over your head, wouldn&#039;t you rather just not have to think about it? Wouldn&#039;t you rather just be overly cautious and avoid the whole thing?

				My beloved SR community, I hate being the bringer of bad news, but SR won&#039;t live forever. If you people are afraid of getting to big, I&#039;m afraid of 50$ per blotter of LSD. Again, if SR goes down, we can rebuild. LE can&#039;t and won&#039;t close the internet. But we may become poor, so please value your and my money and spread the word about SR, in your inner circles.<br /><br />Peace and Love
