No vendor is going to buy from you, giving up their receiving address in the process to some random person on the forum who may or may not be LE. Either way it is against Silk Road Forum rules to advertise items for sale without a vendor account.<br />Game plan: get a vendor account and sell on Silk Road, sell it locally, or take your chances on Black Market Reloaded. Nobody is going to buy it from you here.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				+1&nbsp; We don&#039;t need anyone instigating trades between non-vendor accounts. This needs to be completely scrubbed out for everyone&#039;s safety.
