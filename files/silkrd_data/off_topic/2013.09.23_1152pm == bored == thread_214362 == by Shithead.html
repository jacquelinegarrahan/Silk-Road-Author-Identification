What the fuck&#039;s your problem, man?! You could be an icecream man like good &#039;ol DanDan but nooo...you gotta be a fuckin shithead.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />What kinda tv you gonna watch? Check out Spartacus if you&#039;re into gore and hardcore sex scenes. :D It&#039;s actually got a pretty good storyline and shit (also has violence! Did I mention that?)<br /><br />I hear the road was closed due to wandering cattle. They gotta find a way to clear them off the road...or make a shitload of steaks asap.

				the closest town is 8miles away. I got a bike but I&#039;d smell like shit by the time I got there and there is no shower to be found. I ain&#039;t gonna take whore baths in the sink so theres that. I got it made here any way. I can live without power and live off the land but it sure would suck besides my grandparents live next door and they don&#039;t have a lot of years ahead of them. I&#039;m the bastard grandchild so I get to take care of them. yay. oh boy how I love remembering things for them. and suicide isn&#039;t very appealing ATM.
