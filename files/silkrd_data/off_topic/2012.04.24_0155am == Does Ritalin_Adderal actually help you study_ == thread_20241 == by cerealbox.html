				As someone who may or may not have to study something that may or may not relate to school which I may or may not be currently attended or for work which I may or may not currently be engaging in, would ritalin/adderall actually do me good studying, or is it just a drug to make you stay up all night so you&nbsp; can &quot;cram&quot; for tests?

				I take Adderall on a daily basis. It does help you study, to an extent. It sort of varies person to person.<br />It&#039;s not recommended for cramming, IMO, especially since you&#039;re studying so meticulously, you&#039;ll wear yourself out trying to memorize everything, and with adderall, you&#039;ll want to try to memorize everything. <br /><br />sdesu<br /><br /><br /><br />

				It&#039;s best to use it two days before your exam and even then I wouldn&#039;t cram. The most effective way I found to use adderall is to start studying completely sober for 30 minutes straight and then taking adderall but quickly going back to studying as if you never took it. You&#039;ll then realize 30 minutes later that you already memorized a whole chapter&nbsp; ;)

				Might give you the motivation. Gives me a energy boost, so what you decide to do with that extra energy is really up to you lol.<br /><br />And yep it sure does help you study like a beast. It&#039;s more effective to use it to pull EZ all-nighters compared to cramming though.

				It will not motivate you to study. It will, however, allow you to focus on whatever the hell you are doing. Seriously.<br /><br />Stay away from Facebook/Tumblr/YouTube/the internet the entire time you are studying.<br /><br />You have been warned.&nbsp; ;)

				Have you ever checked out *any* graduate school?&nbsp; The pressure to perform has created a new form of drug culture.&nbsp; 50% is average. <br /><br />It will not make you smarter, but it will help you focus for hours and hours and hours... and hours....&nbsp; I find it motivating, but it could stem from other reasons.
