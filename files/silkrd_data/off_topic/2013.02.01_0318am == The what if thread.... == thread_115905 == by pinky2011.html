				WHAT IF.... A serial killer decided to set up a vendor account, setup all kinds of enticing listings for us innocent drug connoisseurs, then chose his victims based upon who sent him addresses. I feel like I just opened up a major can of worms but i can&#039;t help it. This thought just crossed my mind and now I can&#039;t stop.

				He would be assisting the serial killers. Because he&#039;s stopping the vigilante serial killers from doing their vigilante deeds. <br /><br />.... What if this serial killer arrived at your home, snuck into your house, and just stooped over you while sleeping. He&#039;s breathing all hard and shit. Then a little drop of sweat falls off his forehead and smacks you square in the face. You wake up and BOOM fucking Bill Murray. What are the first words out of your mouth?

				This might already be happening right now.<br /><br />The folks who got drugs leave good reviews.<br />The folks that got killed leave no reviews.<br /><br />The cycle just continues, like a lottery of death.

				So we have now established beyond any reasonable doubt that there IS a silk-road-killer on the loose!<br /><br />Now we need to flush him/her out before anyone else gets hurt.&nbsp; I for one am scared, you should be too.<br />We need to work out who is the psychopath, just like in those TV murder mysteries.
