				I understand that vendors need to make their profit..&nbsp; but do they really need to make THAT much profit off of (maybe) 100mic doses?!<br /><br />-<br />First of all! Good looks to Del Ellis, Mike.Murphy, Dr. Amsterdam and Gamely54 for selling L the way it was meant to be sold::<br /><br />With a minimal profit margin- and MAXIMUM customer ego-loss and eternal satisfaction ;D<br /><br />Just wanted to post to see how many of you guys are questioning this along with me and my crew.<br /><br />I know it&#039;s a vendors market but c&#039;mon guys.. don&#039;t be greedy, at least with the L.&nbsp; People need this stuff, it&#039;s a lot more than just a recreational substance.<br /><br />-<br />Thanks for reading.<br />All of you have a great week.

				almost all vendors that price their strips at 120-150 usually sell bulk listings at amazing price. you just have to ask them. understand that with any commodity, the more you buy the less you pay.

				There are 2 ways of thought when it comes to LSD:<br />1.&nbsp; Understanding that you have one of the most beautiful substances available on the planet and you want to share it with every person you come into contact with that wants to see the light, so you spread it for a reasonable markup.<br />2.&nbsp; Understanding that you have this molecule that people will pay almost anything for given it&#039;s rarity so you charge out the ass for it because you feel you &#039;can&#039;.<br /><br />While nobody is going to do this work for free to random strangers on the internet.

				I havent bought acid in years, It just always gets given to me, more often than i can count in the last two years, the supply is back honestly. I talked to someone on superbowl weekend that was buying vials at 85 a pop. And that was really really clean fluff.&nbsp; But even taking in for fees (which are reasonable given the brilliance of this site, imo) 150 a strip is outrageous, especially given the ease of shipment.<br /><br />props though to all vendors who make the choice to do this, and let us not forget, the market will only charge as much as people are willing to pay...<br /><br />

				There&#039;s no such thing as &quot;greed&quot; in a free marketplace in the way that people are using it. That word is so overused and always out of proper context. If a vendor is really greedy with his product, he won&#039;t be able to stay in business and the competition will drive him out. If other vendors want a bigger market share, one of the big ways they can get it is by offering their product at a lower price.<br /><br />It&#039;s the same nonsense people cry about when disasters hit and people &quot;price gouge&quot; in the area or when people raise rent prices. Supply is limited and demand is high and so prices are high. It&#039;s a two way street. Instead of blaming the &quot;greedy vendors&quot; why not blame the &quot;greedy buyers&quot;? They are affecting the price just as much. Because they are willing to buy large amounts at very high prices the vendors will sell them at those prices.<br /><br />Basic basic basic basic basic basic economics. Not &quot;greed&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;/rant<br /><br />That being said, I haven&#039;t bought any lsd because I also think the prices are too high. I&#039;m holding out and hoping for the best. =D<br />

				I have the opportunity to make a lot of quality mushrooms, but I&#039;m on another continent and this will confuse all customers.<br />But the price would be acceptable, even lower than 1.0 BTC per gram of product.<br /><br />After a while, I will build interesting grow-report (Psilocybe cubensis)
