				As far as I know it stands for Black Market Reloaded, another deep web page with drug sales. I&#039;m fairly sure this site got busted for accepting traceable payment options(Western Union, Paypal etc.) it seems like they were much more lax in their security than SR.

				Ah. Thanks guys. :) I just found it on the hidden wiki. The pricing for stuff doesn&#039;t seem any better so I&#039;ll stay away from it. Thanks again for the heads up.

Like the occasional awesome offer for weed. I&#039;ve never received any bad product on there I&#039;ve never been scammed because I can tell scams apart from legit offers :D<br />Use your brain and you&#039;ll be fine even in scammer infested sites like BMR.

				Small correction: BMR used to allow child porn as well.<br /><br />SR has NEVER allowed it. Stick with original-and-best. :)

				The people offering hitman services scare me a little bit. I don&#039;t want guns or to kill people. I&#039;m just a nice guy who enjoys an occasional nod from heroin.

If they were legitimate, do you not think LE would have caught them because to kill somebody requires them to physically track the person down and kill them, so LE could just order the hit and then protect the guy from a distance who is probably going to be one of their highly trained staff or they&#039;ll be waiting to bust them on conspiracy to murder before they get the chance.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That sums it up pretty well :)

				Yeah that place is the dumps, and Im not just saying it because we are here. <br /><br />Go look around for yourself. Their UI has some perks, but the people and &quot;goods&quot; are worthless, nothing but scammers.<br /><br />I can only wonder why people would end up there instead of here. :\<br />
