				So I&#039;ve been reading lots of posts about peoples experiences with DMT, best methods to smoke, etc. I&#039;m pretty sure I wanna try it. Never done psychedelics before, MDMA, weed (had some real lucid dreams with one batch of weed pretty sweet). With my background in Psychology, I haven&#039;t taken the decision lightly. <br /><br />&lt;b&gt;MY CONCERN&lt;/b&gt; is a number of read experiences state coming across or encountering alien beings/extraterrestrial. Well....I kinda have this fear (not like phobic but on DMT who knows?) of the classic idea of an &quot;Alien.&quot; <br /><br />Like the movie &quot;Signs&quot; freaked the shit out of me when the alien shots showed up. It&#039;s THAT type/depiction of an &quot;Alien&quot; that scares me. Weird monster alien depictions don&#039;t scare me. <br /><br />So you guys think it would be advisable to try DMT? I meditate, I&#039;m definitely into seeking self-actualization, mindfulness all that jazz. I believe in energies we give off. BUT I&#039;M CONCERNED...like if it&#039;s some kind of &quot;Being&quot; I encounter, of light, or shapes, whatevs i think i can handle that. But seriously I read someone&#039;s post about being &quot;taken up into an operating room&quot;......uh no. <br /><br />So what do you guys think? out of mind, out of &quot;break through&quot; sight?

				Hoping to break through for the first time tonight, but I had a really intense DMT experience two nights ago and from what I saw I don&#039;t think you have much to worry about. I spent the whole day speculating on what kind of crazy shit I would see, but none of it even came close to the even crazier shit that actually appeared.

				I&#039;m in a similar situation. I want to try DMT, but have a few reservations. I agree, having a bad trip is something to be concerned about - I&#039;m looking for enlightening experience without any profound effect on<br />my ego (I like my personality!).<br /><br />I largely feel that figuring out the right dosage would prevent you from having a bad trip (starting small and work your way up hasn&#039;t failed me yet), plus the usual precautions with regards to environment and setting. My other concern is that what I&#039;m buying is actual DMT. A lot of people I know with experience with psychedelics say that the market is largely tainted with new RCs (2C-B, 2C-I, NBOMe AcO-DMT, MeO-DMT).

				The thing about dosing DMT is that different amounts give totally different effects. A small amount brings me to a place that someone else here pretty nicely referred to as &quot;Lego Land&quot;, where everything starts to look really bright and blocky like you are in a cartoon. A larger amount gave me some intense visuals and contact with entities, a &quot;breakthrough&quot; dose is supposed to launch you out of your body.<br /><br />As for bad trips, I&#039;ve only had one in my life so far (shrooms) and one thing I learned was that even a bad trip makes for a really hilarious or at least interesting memory.

				I don&#039;t know how much &#039;preparing&#039; yourself you can do for a DMT experience.&nbsp; Make sure you have a quiet place and the &#039;correct&#039; type of music for your experience. Measure your dose as accurately as possible<br /><br />I have never done it before but I will tell you a second hand experience of my friend who recently smoked it.<br />He was suffering with depression. According to him he had been drinking excessively and was generally down with &#039;many dark and evil thoughts&#039;. He basically felt like he was at the bottom.<br /><br />From what I gather he initially smoked what he estimated to be 15mg of dmt. He did not break through.<br />Roughly an hour later he smoke what he claimed to be roughly double that amount while listening to Shpongle (heh) laying in his bed with an experienced dmt friend as a sitter.<br />Within 50 seconds he said he was completely out of his body traveling through what he described as &#039;inter-dimensional wormholes&#039; that he could navigate at will. While navigating the inter-dimensional wormholes he came across a being that he knew could see him and that he could see. He said they made conversation but neither of them could understand exactly what the other was saying. <br />When he returned back to earth he said the experience felt like hours despite only being out for a few minutes. He described physical and mental drain.<br />He also said that when the experience ended he felt as though all of the angst, worry, fear, and evil that had been plaguing him had been washed away. Weeks now and he&#039;s maintained an entirely different outlook on life. <br /><br />Then a few days later a family member of his tried it. The first dose did nothing.<br />Then a larger dose did nothing.<br />Then an EVEN LARGER dose just &quot;made him feel a little light headed&quot;<br />Absolutely nothing. He was and is not taking any other drugs but alcohol and marijuana (and neither of those at the time)<br />Crazy how either brain/organs/soul put on the brakes... or that he is physiologically not susceptible to its effects.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to experience DMT<br />but I want it to be right

				You&#039;ve never done a psychedelic before, and you want to start with DMT? That&#039;s the queen of bad ideas.<br /><br />Do some acid or shrooms or 4-AcO-DMT or 2c-b first. When you&#039;re comfortable with them, move on to DMT. Otherwise you are setting yourself up for disaster.

				I think it depends on where your head is at the time of taking DMT. I wouldnt do it for recreational use. Set a pretense to your session. The WORST thing that can happen to you taking DMT is that you will get nothing out of the experience. Oh also try not to eat before it.

				I just can&#039;t seem to break through, and I&#039;m running out of product. I&#039;ve been having pretty intense visuals and have seen a few entities now, but I just can&#039;t get out of my body. This isn&#039;t the sort of thing I want to do often, honestly the whole substance scares the hell out of me, but I feel like a DMT breakthrough is something I need to experience at least once. Do you guys think if I just load up a ridiculously huge dose, like just dump 1/8 of a tsp in my pipe and rip it I&#039;ll be guaranteed a breakthrough? I don&#039;t want to keep trying for regular doses until the bag is empty only to never break through.
