				So i got a drug test coming up Friday for probation. And i&#039;m going to start off saying dont say &quot;just stop smoking dude, it can be fun!&quot;. i&#039;m not here for rehab here for hopefully people who have been in my position before. <br /><br />So i just got my whizzinator in the mail, and wondering if the drug test can detect the synthetic urine that came with it? <br /><br />If so, how would i preserve someones clean piss to be used, say, 2 days later? <br /><br />Any help would be appreciated. :O<br /><br />Also i&#039;ve looked around on clearnet and see many mixed reviews. figured i&#039;d come here

				The first time I was on probation, I was drug tested regularly and I know that my P.O. used a drug panel cup. If your P.O. uses any kind of panel drug test, dip sticks, ect. then the synthetic urine should be perfectly fine. The only way they can tell that it&#039;s fake(and i don&#039;t even know if they really can or not) is if they send it off to a lab for testing.<br /><br />Urine doesn&#039;t have to be kept in any specific condition that I&#039;m aware of to remain useable. Keep it in a zip-lock bag, a water bottle, whatever you want as long as it won&#039;t spill.<br /><br />Just make sure that nomatter what you use(someone elses urine or the synthetic urine) you keep it VERY warm when you go to use it. Most drug testing cups have a black sticker on the side that will detect the temperature of the specimen, and if it&#039;s not warm enough (or too warm) it&#039;s going to look very bad and will probably get you in alot of trouble, or at the very least, re-tested.

				For me, everytime i went to my PO and was tested i was watched, but i didnt have a whizzinator and actually pissed dirty on my first drug screen. I drank the quickflush drink and thought i was gonna be ok.... fucking drinks... but anyway,<br /><br />After i pissed dirty i had to go to drug treatment and was piss tested once a week. They didnt watch me though and i was able to bring in clean piss with me weekly to pour ever so easily into my pee cup and hand in to the woman at the desk.<br /><br />This was back in the day before the thermo strip on the side of the cup. I think you&#039;ll be all set with the whizzinator. Good luck.

				I&#039;ve always found that consuming an entire bottle of acai berry extract pills usually clears the ole system right out and has better results than the drinks. Plus it&#039;s quite healthy.

				If you are using synthetic urine I would advise buying the latest version of QuickFix and nothing else.&nbsp; Otherwise get someone elses clean urine and freeze it.<br /><br />QuickFix urine is identical to human urine and cannot be distinguished even in a lab environment with todays testing standards.&nbsp; I have used before on several occasions.<br /><br />Be a little careful about Visine bottle because Visine is something people sometimes use to mask drugs in urine and so they test for Visine and would see it in a lab.&nbsp; I suppose if you clean it out well enough and dry it it could do...<br /><br />Since you already have the whizzinator you have that part figured out though.<br /><br />They often include free samples of synthetic urine with the pack but I wouldnt trust anything other an QuickFix personally.

				Gelatine&nbsp; works at least with the cheap tests you can buy at the pharmacy <br />Here is how you do it 4 hours before the test dissolve a pack of easy jello or something like that in a a liter of water and drink wait 2 hours then repeat and then one hour before the test drink one liter of pure water.<br />This works because the body will get rid of the gelatine trough the urine and because of that all other stuff your body tries to get rid of get&#039;s rerouted to get sent out of number two .

				My friend is in the union and he said he is subject to random drug tests. From his research, apparently some drug testers got smart and now they check the temperature of the urine to be 97.8 (I believe) degrees Fahrenheit, matching the human body temperature.

				Glad to hear that everything went alright and wish you the best of luck with your legal situation in the future. Just wanted to say that I saw an earlier post suggesting the QuickFix synthetic urine and I recommend it too if you&#039;re going to go that route, I can tell you from experience that it does work.
