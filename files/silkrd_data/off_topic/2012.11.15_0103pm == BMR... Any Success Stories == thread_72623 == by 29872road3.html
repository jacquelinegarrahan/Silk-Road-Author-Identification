				So I&#039;ve been browsing through Black Market Reloaded. Overall it looks pretty decent. Anyone here ever tried it out or heard of any bad experiences.

				I just signed successfully crated and account there. Prices seem better at BMR than at SR. Vendors use PGP there, and there is a escrow system. It seems good to go. No ordering experience though.

				joined both sites last week, only managed to get on SR briefly this morning to upload some btc&#039;s and when I first joined last friday, but bmr has been fine. <br /><br />so far purchased 1/8 of skunk from danknugsdun and 2g of hash from drgreenfingers both arrived day after order placed and decent stuff. <br /><br />SR definitely looked better though in terms of variety.<br /><br />Both impress me, as after 10+ years dealing with street dealers Im like a kid in a sweet shop.

				I sold successfully there for a short while. I got sketched, as it felt like most my orders were from the police. One guy even gave me his phone number, and was trying to get me to visit. Pretty fucking weird. I almost opened it back up when the SR went down. Still thinking about it, as it seems to be getting better reviews from people. When I was there, everyone hated it, and many vendors had very little sales. <br />Also to note, when SR goes down, many scammers open BMR accounts under common SR vendor names. That&#039;s always a bit funny.

				Agree with the scammers - but on bmr you can look at the individual vendor FB of every deal and what was paid for what. <br /><br />Some vendors have ok FB but its all for 0.0006 btc etc deals from first time buyers, and they are trying to get you to part with 10+ btc for a 1g of coke. So its worth looking in detail at the FB first, before placing an order. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I also signed up with BMR when SR first went down... Not as much selection, and more scammers, so you just have to be extra careful, but the good news is the escrow and with FB you can see all the details of what was ordered, how much, etc.. I noticed alot of growth there in the past 4-5 days, with many SR vendors, but you also gotta watch out for the fakes. It doesn&#039;t hurt to have options though, that way if and when SR is down, we still have options. Dont put all your eggs in one basket.

				BMR is fine and will just get better now, regardless of whether SR regains stability.<br /><br />The hysteria about SR is bizarre. When one goes down another will rise. It&#039;s being happening in the online piracy world since the beginning of the internet.<br /><br />Get a BMR account and roll with the punches.

				Yeah, that&#039;s part of the reason I&#039;ve stuck with SR. lol I don&#039;t want to come off like a moralfag, but I have values I try to live by, just like everyone else. I believe we should be free to do with our own bodies whatever we wish. I was drawn to SR cause it seemed to have an actual philosophy behind it.<br /><br />I support things like weaponry sales as well. But paying to have an explosive sent to someone? That&#039;s where the line is for me. I considered hopping to BMR, but I think I&#039;ll just start contacting vendors via email.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72623.msg594168#msg594168">Quote from: hubbly on November 15, 2012, 06:14 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That site sells some really fucked up shit...

				As a vendor and buyer I will tell you the difference on BMR. One it is filled with scammers who will require you to finalize before sending. It also will not allow a buyer to cancel a transaction if you want to te cancellation has to come from the sellers end. The prices are cheaper yes but the prices are cheaper because Atleast 60% of the vendors are scammers with little to no feedback. The feedback system is misleading as your feedback can reflect purchases you made and it will appear if you are a seller that those feedbacks are from sales rather then te purchases you made so u have to directly read the feedback to see that it in fact wasn&#039;t from successfull sales the seller made.<br /><br />The escrow system is a more effective system aside from the fact that a buyer cannot cancel the transaction<br /><br />Deposits are faster and withdraws are faster<br /><br />A sellers account is only .50 btc so scammers literally have to make no investment to scam <br /><br />Support is limited to just one admin there is only one admin and that is all<br /><br />The site is ultra fast and allows a broader range of products thatthenroad does not allow such as cvv and counterfit cash weapons an what not <br /><br />I do like BMR a bit better however dislike BMR evaluate of the amount of scammers that make it home<br /><br />I have yet to be able to complete a single purchase on BMR due to the high scam rate however if we all head over there if we ever get out btc back that could easily change<br /><br />SR is only better due to its Lower scam rate and the ability to cancel on the buyets side in my opinion however from a code level SR is a mess whereas it appears BMR is definitely built in cleaner code base.<br /><br />I have begun to start to sell at BMR.&nbsp; BMR does have fees associate with withdrawing and fees associated with selling in fact to withdraw your btc for a regular user you will pay a fee plus 2% of whatever you withdraw <br /><br />BMR in my opinion is better overall auto PGP on all transactions is a plus <br /><br />When I say better overall I mean from a code and operational standpoint however I don&#039;t know how if would react to a large user base as silk roads <br /><br />I love SR but all in all these events as of late have shown me how little the actually prepared in regards to protecting there users money,&nbsp; what the hell is te whole point of the backup btc address I thought it was to be used in the event of a situation such as this???&nbsp; &nbsp;Where the fuck is my money....<br /><br />A forum and a 3 rd party escrow system would work best something like a Craigslist for drugs with a few 3rd party escrow systems independently run not connected to the site<br /><br />Idk BMR overall gets my vote on a operational standpoint however SR gets my vote from a quality of vendor and fulfillment standpoint just my opinions <br />

				I placed my first couple of orders over there since the road is down, looks legit, I spent a decent amount of time researching everything on the forums and all that, just find a vendor with good feedback and don&#039;t release your coins until you have the product in hand. Sounds pretty failproof to me, escrow is there for protection, use it like you would on SR

				You really have to watch out for the scammer accounts with the same names as on SR. Vendor Dutchaanbod has stated in their thread here in the forum that the BMR account is not theirs. It is copied word for word from SR and uses the same pics but if you use you will be screwed. As with any online purchase research pays off so just don&#039;t jump because you see the same name. There are numerous SR vendors there but none come anywhere close to the volume of sales as the SR vendors. If SR can&#039;t get issues resolved then BMR can be our fallback plan.

Hopefully BMR can reduce the scams and increase successful transactions. I don&#039;t see why it couldn&#039;t be a successful marketplace if it gets the customer and vendor base. This SR downtime has certainly made lots of people consider the options available and I think healthy competition will be good in many areas for SR. The huge dependency buyers and vendors have on SR isn&#039;t good.

				I have seller account on BMR. I haven&#039;t had any problems with the way it operates. It does have things better than SR and things not as good. The escrow system I like more. You can release shipping from escrow and keep payment separate. ALL sellers have PGP worked into profile so when an order is placed the sensitive infor comes already encrypted. No upfront fee to become vendor(different levels of vendors also). When I signed up it was slooooooooooow going but it has started pick up momentum. There is a ticker where you can watch btc values. You can ask vendor questions on the listing page where everybody can see it. I like BMR its a good #2 alternative to SR.

				Clearly BMR is less mature than SR but having choice and competition is great.<br /><br />Hopefully when BitWasp hits v1, this situation will further improve.<br /><br />

If the PGP key is the same, it&#039;s the same person. Otherwise it could be (and probably is) an imposter.
