				Yeah I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s need for popcorn<br />1st guy didn&#039;t respond and another guy (probably bullshit and a scammer) is slightly threatening me so I&#039;ll go along with it and see what pops up<br /><br />Also anyone on *here* and in California: lets fight. We can make bets, split the cash 20-80 for loser-winner and most importantly have fun<br />If I win I&#039;ll hug the crap out of you<br /><br />@paddy<br />Could one actually make an anonymous stream site? And one that is able to run on the slowness of tor?<br />Also, fighters should obviously be able to make money, but also the people bet correctly. How can both make money?

I wont try to be a nignog about it<br /><br />90% of this is out of boredom, 10% because I&#039;m hoping something can come out of it (onion site/betting/etc)<br />I might be willing to travel just about anywhere in California, granted the destination is at least slightly desirable. It would be fun to go on a trip<br />Also my cousin (who trains) said he might be interested in doing a &quot;fight club&quot; (saying it makes me feel like a teenager), but, since I&#039;m hoping there can be a future in this on the deepweb, I&#039;d really prefer if deepweb surfers were involved<br /><br />If someone doesn&#039;t want to fight, but is interested, I even may be down meeting up with you and you filming me just going around asking people (kindly :) if they want to fight. I&#039;ll pay a hobo if need be
