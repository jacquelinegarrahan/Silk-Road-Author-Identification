				So this is just me rambling a bunch. sorry guys writing was never my strong spot in school.. Just writing this to see what your guys&#039;s thoughts are or if you have any tips.<br /><br />Seems like all the weed vendors are in over their head with customers, and bulk weed sounds like is easy as hell to come across in cali.<br />To give u guys some background, Currently I am 18 year old highschool drop out working fulltime as a cashier. I split rent with my 21 year old sister.<br /><br />I have been been dealing from off the silk road since i moved out of my parents in october. I have been selling weed but most I started making most of my money Less than 3 months ago when i started selling methylone to only one trusted family member. I have been making atleast 1000 a week selling to only one person. I figure by the time my lease expire in October i should have like 20 g&#039;s saved up, probably more. I already have a reliable car.<br /><br />Even tho I have alot of trust in the person i sell to, (were related), I feel it is a very risky business and would be better off on the vendor side of things. <br /><br />I always wanted to move to cali when i was in my 30&#039;s after i made alot of money. I have always been determined to be rich and have read all the get rich and motivational books. (think and grow rich, rich dad poor dad). Previously i had planned to go to school for hvac and start a business in that but the more i think about it i think id enjoy life alot more living in cali selling weed.<br /><br />My friend wants to make the move with me and im trying to find some other people that would want to tag along. <br />Since im 18 and have no credit (just one years rent history) I think itd be impossible to find an person willing to lease to a couple 18 year olds from across the country. I figure itd be impossible to find a job before moving out making it impossible to get a place first. So my plan is to save up like 20g&#039;s, if not more, Get a uhaul and take the shit i need and then stick it in a storage space when i get there. I would stay in a extended stay motel until i find more permanent accomadations. <br /><br />Btw i plan on moving to Santa cruz probably. I feel it be cheaper than living in socal and theres alot of bud being grown up there. Being from the northeast the woods and mountains are majestic to me. I just know the are from wathching weed videos by these guys called the CCC and the area seems like what i dream about in my head.<br /><br />I would then try to get a california id so i could get a weed rec. From there i plan on trying to network as much in the weed world as possible. Try to get in with the dudes at the shops, hit up craiglist, ect. Shouldn&#039;t be that hard before i find a good connect on the dank, preferably like 2k a pound or less.&nbsp; From there id just sell it on the road in like halfies and zipz and move from there. <br /><br />Seems like vendors like NWD went from nowhere to being huge in like 2 months. And the profit margin seems like itd be hard to go wrong. <br /><br />Anyways what do you guys think? any recommendations? What part of cali would be best. I dont want to go to far north as i want to be were the weather is still nice. (santa cruz would be a big step up from New england.) Im just bored where i am at and I figure i only am young once right? what better time to completely start a new life. If i fuck up and go broke i could always just drive back.<br />

				I know plenty of people who get their med card and aren&#039;t Cali residents.&nbsp; Not saying it&#039;s legal but there is plenty of doctors who will do it.&nbsp; North is where the weed is cheap brother.&nbsp; Super cheap.&nbsp; Half price of the best price you&#039;ll find on the road for LBs if you have decent connections.&nbsp; North brother north.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got friends and acquaintances from all around the Humboldt, Mendocino, Eureka, Redding and Ukiah area.&nbsp; One owns hundreds of acres that he grows a lot of weed on. :)<br /><br />Weed brokers make nice cash just buying the bud in northern Cali and bringing it down south and selling it, even to dispensaries.&nbsp; That is how big the price difference is from north and south.

				I would strongly suggest you stay in your own area and if cannabis is that important to you, you should start a petition in your state. I would also like to suggest you get a education first, you are 18 fucking years old, you have a whole lifetime ahead of you!

				You remind me of me haha, similar age and living situation and even from the same area, i have a passion for weed too, i dont know a lot about growing but i&#039;ve done my research and know that its not hard if you are dedicated. <br /><br />If you&#039;re about the money then you should be out selling MDMA and XTC in the clubs to earn a living, if you have a passion for strictly bud and growing then you have a decent plan started already. Maybe practice growing a plant or two (until October) in your sisters place. Make connections before you leave, while you&#039;re still here and arrangements you&#039;ll need before you go 3 thousand miles away haha. <br /><br />The only think i would think twice about if i were you is the recent laws legalizing pot around the US lately. If you plan to be doing this until you retire it may become less profitable as laws become more lax, although i am not sure about that just a thought. <br /><br />1k a week steady is pretty decent for a HS dropout at 18 y/o keep that shit up maybe longer than you want! A couple years at 1k/week (conservatively -im sure you&#039;ll increase profit margins over longer periods of time) do that and youll be able to buy a house before you even get out there. <br /><br />In all honesty i am jealous of you ambition, i wish i had the balls to do what youre thinking about doing (at your age) maybe its not too late for me either ;) good luck bro! keep us updated!

Only like 5 people even know what i do with m. I never talk to anyone about that shit. I figure selling bud on sr is a 100 times safer. Plus id be an area all about weed anyone so the heat would be on the growers not me the buyer.<br /><br />And i fear you are 100% right about the weed laws. Heck since i started highscool to now weed has dropped so much in price in my area. That is why i want to get out there asap. And i dont want to be selling drugs the rest of my life. My goal is to launder the money out and start a big porfolio of real estate. Hopefully by the time im like 25 maybe sooner ill be out of the game completely.

You don&#039;t have that education, it takes YEARS. How can you possibly think you are just going to jump in a business like this for strictly profit to live a good life? That has zero logic to it if you knew this industry. In fact, go for it...you&#039;ll be another bum this county has to deal with. Ruin it some more, asshole. <br /><br />But, lets not forget, you will never accomplish this, so, it&#039;s really just moot situation, good day.&nbsp; &nbsp;.23/10 troll/entertainment thread.

Everyday IRL around me people will come to me for a gram each day and ill see this day in and day out and i&#039;ll even suggest that they just buy a 8th or more to save a little money in the long run, they either don&#039;t see my logic or simply prefer to line my pockets.<br /><br />&nbsp;You wont have to worry about customers, hell if you get out there and start doing things right ill&nbsp; buy bulk from you just email me when you get up and running, 100% honest, i am trying to start selling bud again anyway.<br /><br />BTW MDMA and Marijuana are both Schedule I i think so technically they&#039;re treated equally as bad in the eyes of LE. Now i know it doesn&#039;t really work like that...<br /><br />Also, you can learn to grow weed in like a few hours. Perfecting the art will take time but if you really wanted to you could learn faster than you think. <br /><br />&quot;ruining the country&quot; Selling drugs is a lot better than joining the rest of kids his age who are up to their neck in debt and constantly contribute to the deficit and perpetual bullshit that the US stands for anyway. Becoming a cop or fed or banker or any one of those is 10x worse. <br /><br />Dont listen to the haters bro, DO YOU and make bank i wanna see you achieve your dream(s).
