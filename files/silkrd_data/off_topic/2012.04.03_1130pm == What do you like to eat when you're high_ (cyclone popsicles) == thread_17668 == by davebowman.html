				Here are some links to pictures of what I&#039;m talking about on the normal internet: <br />http://www.transcold.ca/image/Cyclone%20MP.jpg<br />https://s3.amazonaws.com/luuux-original-files/bookmarklet_uploaded/P10-02-12_14-08.jpg<br /><br />I learned from a friend that these popsicles are not only delicious, they can magically replenish your body&#039;s capacity to ingest drugs. Highly recommended while on psychedelics or after having not slept for a prolonged period of time, cyclones are the perfect medicine. In fact they are really great all the time. Its a quick and highly enjoyable way to raise your blood sugar, and there is an active ingredient which makes them better than other candy for this purpose: Magical fairy dust. It&#039;s not listed on the label. <br />

				Sour cream and onion chips...with some dip, man. Some beef jerky. Some peanut butter. Get some Haagen Dazs ice cream bars. A whole lot.<br /><br />Make sure chocolate. Gotta have chocolate, man. Some popcorn. Bread. Graham crackers. Graham crackers with the marshmallows, the little marshmallows. And little chocolate bars.<br /><br />Also celery, grape jelly, Captain Crunch with the little crunch berries. Pizzas. Two big pizzas. Everything on &#039;em. With water, whole lot of water and...

Whoever said chocolate milk is the man. Nachos and dip. KFC never ceases to blow me away.. Oh and popcorn with milk chocolate melted over it topped with marshmallows.

				Freshly prepared food - some easy pasta - a nice salad and I like doing those mixes of cashew, sultana, apple and any salad I can use. Add mayonnaise and always serve some home made chips and a home made burger not some processed thing. Unlike Mc Chips these will go off the next day and mold a few days later. no additives.<br /><br />Stoned I will go the extra mile and spend a good hour listening to music, smoking and preparing some nice meal that makes you feel healthy as well as full. <br /><br />Home made pizza is healthy and cheap.<br /><br />As for the guy with the flaky chin - whilst I would go south - not sure if I&#039;d be eating around the mine shaft. <br /><br />I like getting high and enjoying the company of my women. What happens is not for public consumption though.<br /><br />Maybe I should get an extra vertebrae put in so I can go down on myself.<br /><br />I was so close once! Everyone has tried that. The ones who succeeded I guess they spend a lot of time alone.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

				I love the cyclone popsicle idea! Next time I get some psychs I&#039;m gonna buy a box and whip &#039;em out when everyone is trippin.<br /><br />I like cooking random ethnic foods when I&#039;m high though (assuming it&#039;s not an appetite suppressing substance)

				Gotta agree with the sweet and salty, I like the chex mix or the bugles. Definitely pizza of course. Totally been there stoned out of my mind gobbling up ice cream, gotta love neapolitan man<br /><br />Gonna have to try the popcorn with chocolate and marshmellows damn that sounds amazing<br /><br />I do like to get creative and cook up some shit when I&#039;m high... usually opt for the breakfast and make cinnamon french toast with maple syrup and jam. Or bachelor potatoes and eggs, basically scramble together anything you can find in the fridge thats still good, bacon or sausage, onion, peppers, spinach, shrooms, tomatoes, whatever, and of course potatoes. mmmmmm ya

				pot: anything. and i mean ANYTHING. except cereal. or liver. munchies gets me like a mother fucker.<br />coke: anything savoury. particularly sirloin steak for some reason ???<br />E/mandy: soup, cereal or fruit. anything sloppy basically. apples are good.<br />H: anything sweet but not minty. fresh pineapple or chocolate is awesome.<br />psychs: anything i can get in my mouth without having to concentrate on looking at it. again - pineapple is awesome<br /><br />used to find it difficult to eat on anything apart from pot, but after a massive coke binge a while ago and forcing myself to eat something to stay alive it&#039;s pretty easy to eat on anything now

				anything. in. sight.<br />only on pot though, cant seem to eat on anything else.<br />Someone should start a thread on the weirdest thing you&#039;ve eaten while high, like when munchies hit you like a bitch and theres nothing in sight so you throw the weirdest combination together and it tastes like heaven...
