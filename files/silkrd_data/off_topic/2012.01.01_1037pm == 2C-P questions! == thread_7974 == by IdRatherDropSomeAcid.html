				If you do order some 2c-p, don&#039;t get it from captainwilly, at least at the moment. I ordered a small quantity of 2c-p from him 3 days ago along with sending him a message, no reply to the message and order is still in processing. Now normally 3 days is nothing to worry about, but his profile says he is on silkroad everyday and on the&nbsp; forums everyday and hes not responding to messages. I also asked him to cancel it earlier today, no reply. If you look at his recent feedback, it is in sharp decline and he is now only rated 87/100, with them mostly alluding to long wait times, no shipment, no contact, general unprofessionalism.<br /><br />He has also had threads claiming he is a scammer recently:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6760<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6714.msg59187#msg59187<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3520.msg72035#msg72035<br /><br /><br />The good vendors for 2c-p seem to be ENBOOM (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/15244)<br />or anon1 (http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/14820)<br />&nbsp;

				Oh and you should read erowid information about a substance, any substance, before you use/buy it. It should answer your other questions.<br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cp/2cp.shtml<br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cp/2cp_dose.shtml<br /><br /><br />

				2c-p....that is something I have but don&#039;t like to sell too often. People don&#039;t understand the power of 2c-p and almost always end up in a death trip because it is simply the most potent 2c of all. It is also a never ending dissociative trip. I took it once and it took me a full day to get back to base line.<br /><br />2c-p is one helluva drug. <br /><br />Please don&#039;t underestimate 2c-p. I took a rather large dose of it and bruised a ligament in my mouth trying to make a mouth guard. I guess it wasn&#039;t hot enough so the plastic was just hard and I bit into it as if it was soft.&nbsp; The whole time I thought I had fucked up a tooth and that I would need a root canal. I was fucking terrified. I went to the ER still pretty incredibly fucked up (this was 9 hours after dosing) and they gave me Vicodin because the pain was so bad. So I spent the rest of the day coming off and fucking up on vicodin terrified that I seriously fucked myself. <br /><br />Thank god, the pain went away after a week and a doctor told me I just bruised a ligament.<br /><br /><br />

				I ordered 2c-p from buy-jwh and 2c-t-7 from foxymeow.<br /><br />these are two substances I will start doing very small doses, like 10mg snorted,&nbsp; of course on separate occasions...&nbsp; :D

				Yea, 2C-P is a pretty crazy one. I&#039;d have to recommend using it, but you really do have to be careful with it. There are a ton of places on the clear net that would be willing to send you some if you don&#039;t trust the vendors on here, though.

				Tips for the first time from my experience:<br />a.) Don&#039;t eat couple hours before taking 2C-P and until after comeup.<br />b.) 6mg. is good for the first dose, DON&#039;T go over 10mg.<br />c.) Eat it, at least for teh first time. Snorting or smoking works too, but you don&#039;t wanna do that;)<br />d.) Don&#039;t trip alone, or have an experienced sitter.

				Sometimes you have to run before you can walk. Take 10mg, prepare for 14-16h of tripping.
