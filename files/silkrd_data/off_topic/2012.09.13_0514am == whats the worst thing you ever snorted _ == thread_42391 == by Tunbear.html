				Drug wise, not some stupid shit you snorted because..well, you&#039;re a stupid shit :P<br /><br />Mine would have to be Naphyrone, it sticks to the back of your throat and has the most unpleasant taste, in fact thinking of it makes me heave. And I&#039;m not a fan of body highs, and that stuff makes your body feel weeeeeeeeiiiiiiird.<br /><br />Discuss :D<br /><br />Also, I made it to 100 transactions, I want a parade, kthx

				I dunno, I&#039;ve snorted several different batches of 2C-B, but it wasn&#039;t LEGENDARY like many people claim.&nbsp; Then again, I&#039;ve put so many drugs up my nose over the years that most things don&#039;t bother me too much.&nbsp; The worst thing about 2C-B imho is the duration.&nbsp; It&#039;s like 20 minutes of a bad meph burn that you can&#039;t get away from.&nbsp; In my opinion it takes away from the experience due to the discomfort while coming up.<br /><br />The worst thing i&#039;ve snorted was a particularly bad Meph batch.. :/

				Yeah, one nostril is actually significantly larger than the other.&nbsp; you can see the clear difference.&nbsp; it&#039;s kinda sad seeing that when i look in the mirror.&nbsp; There was a point were i actually smelled rot.&nbsp; That was the catalyst to make me stop snorting drugs altogether for a LONG time till it healed up.&nbsp; I do now from time to time but for the most part i stopped recreationally using drugs in an attempt to better my life.

				I&#039;m torn on this subject cause I have put a lot of stuff up my nose. I don&#039;t think anything can really beat the burn of 2c-b in terms of strength or duration. However me and a friend crushed up some blue molly press pill and snorted it and for some reason it had the most disgusting mint smell ever. It&#039;s like you mixed ass with altoids. Ugh.<br /><br />But yeah, 2cb, terribad. It&#039;s like a thousand ex girlfriends tore through my nose.

				At the dawn of my teenage years, I would snort fucktons of ambien. Mainly for the CEV&#039;s and drunk feeling it would give me. I would do other things like xanax, percs, tramadol, flexiril, pretty much anything I could find in my moms pill cabinet, but the worst burn, taste, and drip was the ambien. I recently snorted some yopo seeds with lime mixture and even that was better than the fucking crushed ambien. Christ it was retarded of me to do that to my developing brain.

				Meth and Ketamine have both given me a bit of discomfort but really nothing I thought was too bad. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve snorted anything where I really thought it was terribly painful. <br /><br />Although the speed I ordered--I don&#039;t know how pure that stuff really was but damn. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll snort the rest of that batch (but honestly, I probably will :P)<br /><br />Cheers

				So I must be the only one who snorted a whole bottle of ground nutmeg mixed with pop rocks when I was a kid. Someone told me the nutmeg would make me trip, and I figured the pop rocks would speed it up. Needless to say it was a dumb fucking idea and it hurts to even think about it now.

				Am I missing something with all these snorting MDMA stories? Like someone above said, I thought dropping it orally was your best bet. Any plus sides at all to snorting MDMA or is it more one of those &quot;give it a shot once, regret the hell out of it later&quot; kind of things?<br /><br />My same thought goes towards pretty much any pharm pill--I thought snorting those was ineffective at best and (like some people have mentioned) a painful nightmare at worst.

				2C-b hurts like a bitch.I dont know what people are talking about MDMA burning.Ive snorted just straight molly and ecstasy tabs and neither one hurt anything like 2C-b I dont actually think either one burns at all it just makes your eyes water a little and the watery eyes only last like 3 minutes maybe and you smell/taste licorice and it tastes amazing that&#039;s it maybe that&#039;s just my batches though and Ive always got lucky but the only other drip that tastes better than MDMA is the orange little beads in adderal! mmmmm&nbsp; :D .From the pain that 2C-b causes when you snort it I wouldn&#039;t doubt it if it melts/destroys/eats the lining of your nose.If you&#039;ve never snorted it just imagine what it would feel like to snort some hydrochloric acid and let it sit there to eat your nose for about 30 minutes and that&#039;s about what it feels like.Ive never personally snorted hydrochloric acid but when I imagine it I imagine it being exactly like how it feels to snort 2C-b.But it wasn&#039;t bad enough to stop me from snorting it again...and again..and again..and again...hahah.But honestly 2C-b literally feels like it is disintegrating the inside of your nose.I dont think anyone saying that molly hurts has tried 2C-b.It sounds dramatic but an accurate comparison for me personally would be molly is like snorting molly and 2C-b is like snorting meth,habanero pepper,wasabi,lye,hot coals,and satans piss at the same time while letting a bee sting the inside of your nose for 30 minutes straight.

				2c-b, Christ alive :o closey followed by a dodge batch of mephedrone. <br />Felt like snorting sand paper constantly for 20mins. Proper burns, but if you want to avoid pain when snorting, snort a bit of water up ya nose just before you snort your substance, makes it so much more bearable.

				The best MDMA I ever dropped was also the worst thing i ever snorted. It stung like a FUCKER for an hour and fucked up my sinuses for about 6 weeks - I developed a permanent dripping nose.

				Ha oh god the amount of times I&#039;ve been in work and been just constantly snorting. Luckily I&#039;ve developed a poker face over years of drug use, so my eyes and face don&#039;t scream &quot;I IS FOOKED!&quot; but the nose is a dead giveaway.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed nowadays nothing seems to sting. I got some MDMA a few weeks ago or so, and snorting it didn&#039;t hurt that much, slight sting..but gave some to a mate after saying it doesn&#039;t sting too much and he was in agony!

				2 things ripped my nose to shreds - 1 a substance, 1 just plain fucking stupidity:<br /><br />Chlorpromazine (largactil) tablets - someone I knew was being prescribed these as an antipsychotic, and claimed they knocked him for six, but were time-release and coated.&nbsp; So a couple of us crunched up a couple each and snorted it.&nbsp; Felt like I&#039;d snorted glass through my nasal cavity and directly into my eyes, and had a nosebleed for about 30mins.&nbsp; When it eventually kicked in it definitely wasn&#039;t worth it.<br /><br />Chilli flakes - dunno how I got talked into this one, but someone I used to know claimed that sprinkling a few chilli flakes (from the commercial disposable grinders you get in most supermarkets) into a joint give it that extra kick.&nbsp; No it didn&#039;t, it just kinda burnt your lungs on the inhale.&nbsp; But we snorted a line for a &quot;laugh&quot;....it wasn&#039;t funny at all - cried for about an hour once I was able to see again.&nbsp; Young, dumb and...that&#039;s about it.<br /><br />Don&#039;t snort either of these things - there is a reason they are designed for oral ingestion only.<br /><br />Better off sticking with good old fashioned drugs.

They do it once a year now.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t brave enough to try it. The Sanka I snorted was somewhat effective though.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;ve read mixed reports on snorting dextromethorphan (DXM) powder. I&#039;ve consumed a lot of DXM powder orally but just recently tried snorting it after being told it was both painful and bio-available that way. It did nothing but plug my sinuses so bad that it took 12 hours and a neti pot to open them up again. It didn&#039;t burn though and I didn&#039;t feel much DXM trippyness. It may have been bunk, talcum power or some such but it was bitter.

				As someone who&#039;s snorted a lot of things (including cayenne pepper in my youth), I can honestly say that 4-FA is the worst thing any human could ever put up their nose.&nbsp; The pain is intense and lingers for about 30 minutes after the fact.&nbsp; Your nose will bleed.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; It feels like hydrochloric acid in your sinuses.&nbsp; Terrible.&nbsp;

				The worst thing ive snorted is Speed.<br />Its a horrible sensation.&nbsp; Your nose pisses out like you got a fever and after a while the buzz is a bit tough to control.<br />You can end up doing some really bizarre shit when on speed, stay away from the crap.<br />I dont know what they call it in america, thinking about it.

				I agree with Adasel actually, speed was the worst shit to ever snort... I had a crazy come up, way too rushy and the worst comedown of my life.. the most depressing and wrong mindset ever.. kinda also why it was the worst thing to snort, because I felt very dirty after it&nbsp; :-\

				EZ, to be honest I don&#039;t find speed too difficult on the nose. meth is pretty awful to sniff and burns like a bitch but 2C-B/E and I&#039;m sure other 2C drugs (though not tried) are in another league of pain!! Feels like someone is poking you up the nose with a hot metal pin...

				2c-i. That shit was horriable. I thought 4-fa was bad. Don&#039;t get me wrong 4-fa burns, but only for about 10 to 15 minutes. 2c-i doesn&#039;t burn at first, it just slowly builds up for about 45 minutes. 2c-b is painful, but nothing compared to 2c-i.

				I cant stand to put anything up my nose. I cant see why anyone would snort 2cb and MDMA, for me it would just ruin the experience!<br />Because of this, I only have K, coke and speed to compare and out of this its K that I hate. Really does make the experience less fun as I have only ever done it in K hole doses, maybe it isnt so bad if your just bumping at music events. Unfortunately, bombing K is a waste so hey ho, up the nose it goes!

It burned, not as bad as the x pill, but it also worked.

				Maybe I&#039;m a pig :-D but....I was in my holiday and I lost my snuff tobacco. I could not find any market or smthg where I could buy snuff.<br />So I decided very quickly: I went to the normal shop and buy a quality brand of normal tobacco to pipe. I took a little piece of tobacco and meld it in alittle hard box with coins. It was almost looks like a snuff dust, it was smell fine, but the taste! F_ck, I never do it again! :-D maybe it depends only on the brand, I don&#039;t know, but really I never do it again :-)))<br /><br />This is my last the worst experience and from this time I snort only the best things ;-)

				I was dire straits in the middle of nowhere in the Philippines, and had ran out of cigarettes.&nbsp; My dickhead friend said he&#039;d split the last of his if I would snort a line of some chili powder he had gotten with some food.&nbsp; It was fucking terrible, about 20 minutes of feeling like there was a hot ember inside my head.&nbsp; Worse than any drug I&#039;ve tried.
