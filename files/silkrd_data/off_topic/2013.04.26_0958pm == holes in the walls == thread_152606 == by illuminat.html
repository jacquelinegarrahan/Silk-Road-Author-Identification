				alright, seriously people, I would have noticed those holes before now if they were there, and it sounds like some sort of electric pulley system or something in the wall as well as drilling from above.

				illuminat, clearly your paranoid ... and probably stoned. <br />Did you ever think of calling the landlord to look at the holes? Maybe just fix them yourself and take at close look at what you&#039;re fixing. Jeez, if you think someone&#039;s got cameras on you just go look.

				its a block of flats. the neighbors are upstairs, the wall that I heard the noise in connects one of my rooms to another so its not coming from someone elses flat but from inside the wall.<br /><br />and yes I was stoned, and yes by nature I am fucking paranoid, that does not mean it isnt happening.<br /><br />and as to the cameras I would not find them if they were there if they use fiber optic cables/lenses and move them about.<br /><br />what else could they be doing inside of my wall !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

				It is not a joke, I did create the holes in packages thread, but it is unrelated.<br /><br />There are 3 holes on each of my walls about 3mm wide, they are blocked up now, they are still there, I did not imagine them.&nbsp; and there was electrical noise coming from inside the walls that I have never heard before, I have been living here over a year.
