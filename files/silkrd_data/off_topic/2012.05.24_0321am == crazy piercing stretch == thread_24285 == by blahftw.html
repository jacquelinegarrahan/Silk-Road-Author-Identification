				i know this is really off topic, but thats why i&#039;m putting it here.<br /><br />a couple of hours ago, i stretched the 14g standard tongue stud, to a 4g barbell.&nbsp; the size difference we&#039;re talking about is pretty massive, when talking about a hole in a muscle.&nbsp; <br /><br />i used to be a licensed piercer, and i did it at my old shop, with proper gear.&nbsp; they just love watching me do shit like that, and let me use whatever i need, cause they cringe as they watch me do it to myself.<br /><br />but, there was no tearing, and have now made the largest stretch to my own person, and through a muscle.&nbsp; it hurt sooooo good.&nbsp; i&#039;m a masochist, what can i say.&nbsp; next will be suspension from &quot;meat&quot; hooks.&nbsp; i&#039;m already building a rig, and have a trusted fellow piercer to do the 4g piercings.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyway, enough about my self torture.&nbsp; i do it sober though.&nbsp; self inflicted pain is one of my drugs of choice.&nbsp; was just curious if there were any other freaks out there.

				Hahahah yeah dude I&#039;ve been to some Slipknot and Slayer shows, the people there are ridiculous haha but it&#039;s great fun. Mudvayne also used to be the shit, when they performed with all that crazy makeup and stuff. Tbh I&#039;m not sure why I made this my username, I just wanted to get on here as quick as possible and it was the first thing that popped into my head! <br /><br />I&#039;m slowly gauging up my ears... I want them to return to normal someday lol, but damn 14g to 4g in your tongue of all places, yiiikes. I prefer pain from exercise lol

It&#039;s a fucking amazing experience :)<br /><br />The hooks initially hurt like a bitch, but when you get off the ground it&#039;s like you&#039;re soaring. I spun horizontally, walked up the wall. The funny thing is I went because of a friend who was going to his suspension, as a support kind of thing. Body mod was his thing. <br /><br />But yeah, I turned out to stay up longer than him. They even called me a &quot;Natural born hooker&quot; haha!&nbsp; :D Great experience.

				thats awesome cap.&nbsp; i wanted to do it here, as my friends band played, but being in the bible belt has given me a big &quot;no&quot; as part of a show.&nbsp; so i have to resort to private party/gigs.&nbsp; &nbsp;but i can&#039;t wait.&nbsp; i just somehow feel it is something i need to do.&nbsp; i don&#039;t care so much about an audience, but with something as hardcore as suspension, why not have people to tell your story, so you don&#039;t have to yourself, ya know?&nbsp; i&#039;m really stoked about getting my rig done. i&#039;m gonna use parachute line, with suspension hooks, attached to a 2x4. keep it simple, and ol skool.
