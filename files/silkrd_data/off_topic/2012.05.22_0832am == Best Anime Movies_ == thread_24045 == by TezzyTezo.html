				Spirited Away was one of the best anime films to me. Anyone else know of any good ones they might recommend? :P

				Spirited Away is indeed a wonderful example. Actually, I have great love for Studio Ghibli films in general, such as Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso, and Grave of the Fireflies (really sad but very good).<br /><br />Another good one is Akira, I&#039;ve had a lot of people who dislike anime as a general rule make an exception for that one, as well as the shows FLCL and Cowboy Bebop.<br /><br />There maybe another movie I like that I&#039;m not thinking of, but Akira and Studio Ghibli&#039;s covers most of them at least.

				I also love Ghibli films! I would also recommend The End of Evangelion. Really good if you enjoyed the show!

				I&#039;m not big into anime at all, up until last year the only anime I had ever seen was what was on Adult Swim while I waited for Aqua Teen Hunger Force or something to come on.<br /><br />But I did get pretty high and watch Spirited Away and enjoyed it, and then Tales from Earthsea was also entertaining.

				I think &quot;Ghost in a Shell&quot; (the original)&nbsp; and not so much the sequel.

				The anime Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex was fucking incredible, if you&#039;re up for watching a series.<br />Another Miyazaki movie I would strongly suggest is Howls Moving Castle. I could watch that again and again.<br /><br />And lastly, I would strongly suggest watching the Animatrix. It&#039;s not so much one big movie as much as a compilation of anime shorts of different styles, all taking place in the Matrix world.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />~Toker

				I&#039;m getting some great titles from this thread. Keep em coming guys! While I may not be the OP, there are certainly names that I haven&#039;t yet seen popping up here. So many thanks.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />~Toker

				I agree with all the mentions here so far :D Mononoke holds a special place in my heart...Here are some I didn&#039;t see...<br /><br />-Angel&#039;s Egg <br />-Paprika<br />-Ninja Scroll<br /><br />Oh, and as far as the Evangelion movies go, they are great, and similarly Berserk, an equally classic series, is getting the same 3-movie treatment. The first movie is already out and was pretty cool, although seeing the series first would definitely be worthwhile.
