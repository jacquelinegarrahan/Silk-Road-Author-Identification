				Prolly more than u think :D <br />I prefer scoring my desired drugs/meds from my laptop and have them mailed to me instead of having to hang out with the bad type druggies IRL.<br />Had too many dealers trying to lay their hands on me, am sick of that. <br />Just because I buy stimulants that work on the sexual side too does not mean I want to share them and my body with the dealer who sells them.<br />SR does exactly that plus the security that you will get what you ordered. So far all purchases lived up to my expectations, and I am glad I can now indulge in stuff I only knew from PIHKAL/TIHKAL. <br />But I wonder how many female vendors there are. IRL I have met less than a handful of female dealers as they all cited violence and non-payments as the most deterring issues in distributing stuff.

				I&#039;m a girl and I mainly buy heroin...it seems as if there are not too many ladies here who do that. I wish I had some cool girl friends that also used heroin. I went through my weed/shroom/E/acid phases already in college; those have no appeal to me now.

				It&#039;s funny you guys mention you never see women drug dealers because where I live there&#039;s plenty. In fact most of my dealers are females. The men here are all the same, assholes who cut their dope and try to fuck over their own family members where the women are actually honest. I have a few male friends but most of them never grow and remain ignorant, just not the type of people you want to conduct larger business with. <br /><br />When I lived in a big city there was no way I would see some shit like this, it just didn&#039;t exist.

				There is a surprisingly large contingent of la femmes here on SR.<br /><br />Kitkat has already spoken for herself, and we all know of the great moderator Botulism, who is mated with moonflower.<br /><br />There are many who are openly female, and probably many more pretending to be male.

				hahaha yea I hear you on getting them freebies it&#039;s almost worth it but I just can&quot;t bring myself to do it.<br /><br />I love that series of Batman tho. That Cristian dude did a good job playing Batman. Ledger&#039;s part reminds me of Gibson in Braveheart. Too bad he died tho. Seems like there&#039;s a list of young actors and actresses dieing from parting. Anna nicole smith, britney murphy, wander if Lindsey Lohan will survive?

				Hey brianbertz, sorry about spelling the name wrong old boy. Just having a little fun, I sometimes get bored too... <br />&nbsp;I&#039;m not counting the &#039;chicks&#039; on SR, but if the last few posts on this thread are anything to go by, there&#039;s no shortage of &#039;bitches&#039; :)

				I love how no matter the topic,&nbsp; useful for useless, its always a short time before every one is at one anothers throats, for some reason or another.<br /><br />I for one thought this to be a awesome thread, simply for all us out there that cant have our cake and eat it too(wifes and gfs that do not share this common love of mind altering substances). So that note, any of you incredible girls care to be my SR mistress?

				Our lady does not &#039;metabolize&#039; drugs well. She is however very GGG (good, giving, game) so we roll and, we&#039;re convinced she gets a &#039;contact high&#039; from us. This may sound fanciful, but Shulgin himself describes it on at least one trip report I have read.<br /><br />We don&#039;t know how she gets through the day (and the shit sandwich that she calls a job) without something mind altering -not even caffeine!<br /><br />Maybe for that admirable fortitude, we love her, and would not trade her for no SR chick... no disrespect to you sassy SR ladies, some of you give great thread. But we know a treasure when we have one. &lt;3<br /><br />OK mushy love declaration over, back to counting the chicks on SR...<br />

				I give karma points to chicks who post booby shots.&nbsp; Liberate those boobs and set them free.&nbsp; Snap the chains of oppression and set them free.&nbsp; Burn the bra, shout girl power!&nbsp; Girl power!&nbsp; Tear off those shirts and bras and stand up proud .&nbsp;
