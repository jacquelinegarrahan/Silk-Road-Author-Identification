				So, <br /><br />I&#039;m stupidly high, locked to my sofa and was thinking.<br /><br />&#039;Oh shit, what if... Someone i know in real life is a member here at SR and I don&#039;t even know their username&#039;<br /><br />Chances are high I suppose for our USA counterparts although I can&#039;t see me knowing many people on here.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Daaaannnkkkk

				I prefer not to tell anyone about here. <br /><br />There&#039;s only 3 other people who know I&#039;m on here and hope to keep it that way.<br /><br />Dank

				I don&#039;t know who, but I&#039;m pretty sure I know a weed dealer irl that gets his stuff off here. I&#039;m basing it purely off of the fact he gets different named strains often that coincide with what some of the vendors here get, and he has had thc lollipops on several occasions. He might just have a personal hookup with some grower or medicinal shop I guess, but probably be more likely he buys from here. I just don&#039;t want to out myself in the process of blatantly asking him, and probably scare him some too as I don&#039;t know him that well.

				I have one friend who may or may not be on here. I introduced him to SR, but I don&#039;t know if he uses the forums or not, and he doesn&#039;t know my username. Aside from him, I have two other friends who know about it, but (as far as I know) don&#039;t use SR.<br /><br />But there&#039;s really no way to know, is there? I often wonder how many other people in the city I live in use it.

				My RL friends introduced me to SR but I don&#039;t have any further people I&#039;d like to introduce. I tend to think that something as interesting and exciting as SR might loosen their lips around others quite a bit more than their normal route to getting weed. Someone would have to impress me fairly well for me to show them, as if anyone heard them talking it&#039;d lead back to me, and that just wouldn&#039;t be good.<br /><br />I&#039;m happy enough just telling them my friends have connects who occasionally roll through town for a day to drop off some very nice kind bud.

				I don&#039;t smoke much anymore, but when I did, I documented my thoughts. I have dozens of pages in Microsoft Word about religion, philosophy, pop culture, and other areas from when I was stoned. Someday I&#039;ll compile, prune, and print them.

No way anyone could sell that shit and make money.<br /><br />Aside from that, I know one person on here. Another person knows about SR, he tells people, wish I hadn&#039;t told him. They are always asking me how to get on, I refuse to tell them.

You aren&#039;t just buying a product here, you&#039;re buying a service. If you just put weed in a box and mail it, it will get caught. The packaging to make it stealth, odor wise, can be pricey, and then post isn&#039;t always cheap.<br /><br />I wish I was stoned.
