				Meshuggah, Watain, Gojira, MASTODON... Hellyeah for Vinnie Paul... Steel Panther if you want some comedy with throbbing riffs and slashing solos... Its gotta be heavy for me!<br />But for something to get you bopping, funk/blues/jazz , Black Joe Lewis and The Honeybears! PooTube mustang ranch, best filmclip, and booty city... make sure you&#039;re nicely toasted, but you don&#039;t have to be!

				PAGOD is great, if only coz its ALL Syd! The old man used to run Zabriskie Pt, UG and Relics all the time! Their titles are trippy enough without even hearing the music, several species of small furry creatures gathered together in a cave and grooving with a pict. I do like their psych stuff, but I lean more toward the instrumental rock side of Floyd - The whole Animals album, both parts to shine on! I love watching the Wall tripping balls, seeing a massive Arse walking around passing judgement rings strangely true for some reason!!!<br />I&#039;m a musician myself, brass instruments and percussion, but teaching myself guitar a few years back, noone helped more than Gilmour!

				&nbsp;JAZZ!!!!!!!! JAZZ IS THE BEST !!! even if you dont like jazz (which i dont really), it&#039;s still fucking awesome tripping!! I&#039;m pumped I&#039;m the first one to post anything about jazz. Go with Miles Davis and John Coltrane Columbia recordings and/or &quot;Jazz at massey&quot; w/ Dizzy gillespie, charlie parker, charles mingus and others! it&#039;s mind blowing. Rhapsody in blue is a badass song too to throw in there<br /><br />Other choice include: <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pink Floyd - Ummagumma(live and studio albums; live for LSD and studio for mushies. imo), shine on you crazy diamond, and echoes<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Tool - 10,000 days (both the album and the song of same name)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Classical- Classical is fun and imaginative similar to Jazz; Go with something from the classical era like Mozart and try to stick to concertos and/or symphonies - they tend to be the busiest (e.g. best trip experience) <br /><br /><br />Bucket, +1 for Lou reed and VU.&nbsp; Fucking &lt;3 Lou, like I cannot express<br /><br /><br />Edit: I pretty much went straight from here to makinga Lo Reed Appreciation thread. LOL!! i dont know why, but anyone who digs lou reed and the Velvet Underground should check it for sure:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=12946.0

				+1 for 10,000 days (the album). The whole record flows so well, I never skip songs! Listening to that record in the dark with headphones on and a nice fat spliff in hand never gets old. Oh, and one of the songs is called &quot;Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman)&quot; and lyrics of this song -WARNING CLEARNET- http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/rosettastoned.html - WARNING CLEARNET - have more drug references than I can be bothered to count!<br />And ShieLdz, what are your top 3 jazz albums?

To round off my top 3 though, last would HAVE to be Coltrane, &quot;Blue train&quot; is a really good album.<br /><br />For real though, if you get the &quot;Miles davis and John Coltrane The Complete Colunmbia Recordings&quot; + &quot;Jazz at massey&quot; you&#039;ll have enough REALLY GOOD jazz to last you awhile (I think miles and coltrane columbia recordings is like 5 or 6 cd&#039;s in all)

				Personally, I really don&#039;t like music while tripping. It sounds too muffled or disorienting. I listen to a sound I like and go, &quot;this sounds so much better while sober. The beat&#039;s all wrong...warped...&quot; <br /><br />Now, music on e and weed...that&#039;s a whole &#039;nother thing. Nothing better than dropping some MDMA or smoking a bowl and just immersing yourself in music you love. I hated Lady Gaga and most new pop until I tried e for the first time. Now I just can&#039;t get enough, though there is some shame and I admit that almost all of it is entirely crap. But it&#039;s catchy, bass-filled crap.

Go out for a walk, see what a video game is like if I can somehow manage to start it up despite being horribly impaired... <br /><br />I suppose the music issue is that I find sound so utterly incredible while on e and when I used to smoke pot a lot, so when I start tripping I automatically get the unrealistic expectation that it&#039;s going to sound just as good, which is probably impossible. When I eventually try acid, I&#039;ll be sure to give music another chance.

I WILL try shpongle next time I trip then. I&#039;ve never heard of them before, but that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Honestly, I had NO respect for jazz, until an old, OLD school head (that does not listen jazz on the regular) handed me Miles davis and john Coltrane complete Columbia recordings and said &quot;here listen to this when you dose&quot;....changed EVERYTHING! Now it&#039;s pretty much the only thing I listen to when I trip<br /><br />I thought everyone knew the power of jazz and lsd...

				Digi, I dig the clasical picks, beethoven is my favorite classical of all time; but how do you feel about mozart tripping? Normally I dont care for mozart, but tripping it sends my imagination running wild...<br /><br />Gary, ncie call on BBVD - I just looked them up, made me for nostalgic for the 90&#039;s..remember the zoot-suit comeback? - but idk about tripping I like that traditional jazz has NO vocals (once again sends imagination to places i didn&#039;t know existed). I&#039;ll still try it though, i mean why not!&nbsp; 8)
