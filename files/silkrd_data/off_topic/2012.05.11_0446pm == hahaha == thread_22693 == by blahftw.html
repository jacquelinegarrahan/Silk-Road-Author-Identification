				it was here, in off topic.&nbsp; <br /><br />was asking what people thought of starting a slander service.&nbsp; since i keep getting neg karma, my goal is to reach 100 neg karma points in the next month.&nbsp; that i would go make rude and obnoxious posts on whomever you pleases thread.&nbsp; that i would make up to 3 nasty comments, and would not troll, as arguing isn&#039;t my thing.&nbsp; and that i would ask a small tip of 2btc for my time.&nbsp; it was a joke, spinning off another thread where debt collector was mocked as a cyber hitman.&nbsp; <br /><br />not a huge deal really, i just thought it was funny it disappeared with only 2 comments, about a half hour after it was posted.<br /><br />you&#039;re ok limetless, not pointing fingers.&nbsp; the british thing stands true though.&nbsp; brits can have a rude sense of humor, and nobody says anything.&nbsp; but if an american has an off sense of humor, god forbid that.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Shit the bed yeah I did see your thread earlier actually. Made me laugh lol. <br /><br />Not sure why it was taken down. Weird. <br /><br />And why thank you, I do my best. :P&nbsp; And yeah it&#039;s true, we English have a sort of dark and out west sense of humour. I think we get away with it though because a lot of Americans just don&#039;t get it and are like &quot;Yeahhhh.....ok thennnn....let&#039;s just agree and laugh&quot;. It&#039;s good to see Americans with off beat funny bones though. Means we&#039;re rubbing off on you. ;)<br /><br />P.S...and by rubbing off on you, I mean that is the most homoerotic way possible... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Look there is some more British humour!

				If I recall my torts class correctly....<br /><br />Slander: A spoken statement whereby the speaker utters a statement,&nbsp; which he knows to be untrue, or has reason to believe it to be untrue, and the other person is harmed by the statement. The truth of the statement is an absolute defense to liability. <br /><br />Having said that, the only way you can harm someone on SR is to say they are a scammer. Therefore, unless you start throwing the scammer label around, it will be hard to slander anyone on the silk road forums.<br /><br />
