				Do you guys think you&#039;d be able to spare bitcoins to the people who just started, so they can try the system? Why would it be a good/bad idea? I know there are people who would do it out of the kindness of their hearts, but why?

				i would rather spare a few bitcoins to long term members I have been conversing with on a weekly basis than just any random new user begging for coin.. <br /><br />I dont really care if new users sign up or not.

				I am not asking for money. I&#039;m just wondering if it would be a good idea, or not? Say... You give someone enough to make a purchase, and they like how everything works. Right? Well, now say that the person starts selling stuff on SR, and you stumble across the posting, and it&#039;s something you want. Do you think that the person would offer reduced rates, or give you a sample or two for your generosity? Or would you just be losing out on money in the end?

				Why should there be a handicap offered to new users when most of us learned PGP, how to buy bitcoins and all that jazz on our own? <br />Buying bitcoins works as a shit-test to weed out who is invested enough to act responsibly on the Silk Road and contribute to it as opposed to newbies who would make their free purchase of half a gram molly and then chalk it up as &quot;strange&quot;, never to be seen again per your idea.<br />Not really a veteran, just my 0.2 cents.

				I&#039;m no Veteran, but I have spent over 3,500 on SR and have perfect buying stats. Plan to become a vendor soon as well.<br />You shouldn&#039;t spot a first time user for their first purchase. They need to understand how the system works and do their research, as well as learn SR etiquette. <br />If a New User is asking for anything, it should be advice and not money. I&#039;d be happy to answer any questions you might have bud, everyone was new at some point. And man was I clueless when I first started.
