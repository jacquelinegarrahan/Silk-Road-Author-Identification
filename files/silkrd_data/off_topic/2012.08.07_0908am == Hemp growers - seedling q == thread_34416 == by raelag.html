				I was wondering, this is not an issue, but<br /><br />When seedling sprouts, from cannabis seed, in hydroponics, when it grows first set of leaves, and is about to make second -&gt; About one week old, lets say...<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed sprout in this stage always fall a little on side, like from strong wind. It always then recovers in about half week, and position itself vertically, but this seems strange to me at all.<br /><br />I&#039;ve left other conditions out, for a reason. Can anyone judging by symptoms tell me, why seedlings do this?<br /><br />Thanks.

				This is usually due to the weight of the top of the plant. This can be prevented by pointing a small fan at the seedlings from as soon as you see the seedling come tyrough the soil, this has the effect of strengthening the stalk of the plant, causing it to thicken up and become more suppirtive. Very important if growing sativa strains due to their tendency to stretch and bend due to the weight of mature buds.

				It might be positioning itself toward the light, or the light may need to be further away from the the vulnerable seedling and it is too much for it. I would use fluorescent type light for seedlings.

				Thanks. Lights are ESL and led, they lean against lightsource, so I guess it is not it.<br /><br />They do actually always fall.. Well, like I said it can be fixed, but plant fixes itself quite well, so I was just curious.<br /><br />My guess would be a little droplets of water do make seedling a bit heavier and it falls, while steam is very-very weak.<br /><br />Once or twice a day I put u.son. fogger in place for about 15 mins, in starting stage, especially with cutting, but works with young seedlings too, seems helping.<br /><br />Later on excess water can cause mold, but in start stage no harm other than constant falling for half-a-week. Imo, of course. <br /><br />Does it seems like it have some ground?<br /><br />Btw, little offtopic, I didtry fogger as a base for aeroponics. If to vaporize water by heat, it becomes distilled, but what about fogger? Tested it like that - have put fogger in saltwater, and then into the plastic box.<br /><br />15 mins later - licked wall of box, and it was salty! Ie - ultrasonic fogger hits water molecules out of whole mass, but it also takes NaCl iones as it seems, and therefore - will transfer plantfood, at least to some extent.<br /><br />So if one to try, it might be interesting idea to build aeroponics with cheap china foggers.<br /><br />&lt;/offtopic&gt;

				Yep.. Cl- ion is about 180 pm, Na+=0.1, water neutral, h2o=100-200 pm, ie - Na+&lt;H2O&lt;Cl- by size.<br /><br />M(H2O)=1+1+8=10<br />M(Na)=11<br />M(Cl)=17<br /><br />Ie by mass M(H2O) almost=M(Na), M(Cl) is bigger.<br /><br />So far, it seems like pezomembrane is more likely to hit Na+ out of water then Cl-. So one to teoretize, that as Na supply even food salt might be suitable, Na+, no Cl-, no stupid osmosis (salt pickle).. <br /><br />Or am I missing something?

				I am confused what you have your seedlings in is it something like an aero cloner?<br /><br />Whatever it is you want plain water in there without any nutrients. Reverse osmosis water, spring water, or anything like that is fine. There should be zero salt in your water.<br /><br />I would use peat pucks, or a special seedling tray until they have some roots then place them in your growing system, but that is just my personal preference.<br /><br />You also do not want the water on the leaves of your seedlings just the roots with plenty of oxygen too. When water is on the leaves it amplifies the light and hurts the seedlings really you never want water on your cannabis leaves unless you are doing a foliar feeding and that would be in vegetative stage once they are past seedling.<br />

				Danke, thought so :-) <br /><br />Am actually adding very mild P-K into fog. This one growtime.. Will keep reported here later, seems interesting: &quot;Foliar feeding/aeroponics with ultrasonic fogger. Advantages/disadvanages&quot;.

				And complete offtopic: Peltier cooling elements, in cannabis growing...<br /><br />High temperature is often a problem, how about such solution - buy liquid cpu cooling with tiny radiator, and two peltier elements. Both available at china stores.<br /><br />Then - one element transfers heat from lamp, cooltube or whatever contraption, to radiator, to water, to remote place, to another radiator, and with second peltier into &#039;remote place&#039;<br /><br />So, here is simple temperature transfering, but.. Not free, even from china - but would it be reasonable to test such thing at all?

				Seedlings will grow tall and lanky if you don&#039;t give them enough light and if the temperature is too high.&nbsp; They will not grow as high and won&#039;t fall over if you keep the temperature around 68-70 degrees Farinheight for the air, [the soil temperature can be higher around 75 degrees Farinheight to help roots grow faster, by putting a heating pad or something underneath the cups they&#039;re in], but make sure the air temperature is still around 68-70 degrees Farinheight after the heating pad is on and watch it to make sure it doesn&#039;t get the seedlings soil too hot. The only other thing to not having tall lanky seedlings that are week and fall over is to make sure they get intense enough light, a 65 watt CFL, [Compact Fluoresant Light] or two,[depending how many seedlings you have], should solve your light problems. They need to be placed kind of close to the seedlings, [about 6&quot;-12&quot; above the seedlings], because they don&#039;t put off that many lumens, plus they&#039;re not that hot at all so they don&#039;t burn the seedlings. <br />&nbsp;That should solve your tall lanky week seedling problem, hope this helps.
