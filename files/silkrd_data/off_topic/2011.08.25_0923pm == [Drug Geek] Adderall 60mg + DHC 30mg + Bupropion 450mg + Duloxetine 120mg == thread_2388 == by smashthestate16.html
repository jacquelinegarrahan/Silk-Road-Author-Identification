				Hey all.&nbsp; I&#039;m speedy so I thought I&#039;d contribute to this great community by providing a little reading material for other high people! <br />I take 450mg Wellbutrin XR (bupropion, NDRI) as well as Cymbalta 120mg (duloxetine, SNRI) on a once-daily basis for MDD and GAD.<br /><br />Michelle Obama&#039;s face looks EXACTLY like a chimp&#039;s. Okay, I needed to get that off my chest.<br /><br />Today I took 60mg of Adderall IR (mixed amphetamine salts, NDRA) with 30mg of Teva&#039;s DHC (dihydrocodeine, mu opioid agonist).<br /><br /><br />FAQ (brief descriptions of complex concepts for digestion by the drug connoisseur) Skip this section to read about the actual trip.<br /><br />Key: (for my apprentice learners here)<br /><br />MDD: Major Depressive Disorder<br />GAD: Generalized Anxiety Disorder<br />NDRI: Noradrenaline-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor<br />SNRI: Serotonin-Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor<br />NDRA: Noradrenaline-Dopamine Releasing Agent<br />mu opioid agonist: One of three types of opioid receptors, this is the one associated with euphoria as well as respiratory depression (makes it harder to breathe). AKA Î¼-opioid receptors (MOR).<br /><br />FAQ (brief descriptions of complex concepts for digestion by the drug connoisseur) Skip this section to read about the actual trip.<br /><br />The Key Players (neurotransmitters)<br /><br />Whats serotonin do?<br />The neurotransmitter serotonin AKA 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has at least two dozen-ish unique functions and certainly more that haven&#039;t been identified yet. Most importantly, it regulates mood and forms your understanding of reality. It is possible to die from having too much serotonin, this is called serotonin syndrome. Starts out as a very bad headache, and aching in the limbs (due to highly constricted blood vessels) and can progress into uncontrollable muscle movements, hallucinations, and coma and/or death eventually. Serotonin receptors are the target of most commonly used hallucinogenic substances. By inserting for example, an LSD molecule into a serotonin receptor instead of serotonin, one&#039;s perception of reality is altered, if enough chemical is present (say TWO SHEETS of LSD, or something ridiculous), this can be a permanent effect, resulting in a irreversible state of paranoid schizophrenia, oftentimes.<br /><br />What does dopamine do?<br />Most importantly this is the neurotransmitter fuel that powers your brain&#039;s &quot;reward&quot; mechanism. Dopamine is released naturally by the brain in response to eating, drinking, sex, exercise, and after accomplishing something of importance. This chemical is able to provide a feeling of euphoria, increased energy, confidence, self-worth, etc, blah blah blah. As an interesting side note, anti-psychotic drugs work by blocking certain dopamine receptors (as part of the effect). An extremely overloaded dopamine system can cause psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia, which is usually reversible when the offending chemical is removed from the body. A damaged dopamine system can result in a diminished ability to feel pleasure, and loss of motor control (Parkinson&#039;s Disease). Often, there are no recognizable symptoms of a damaged dopamine system until it is more than 75% gone. When dopamine is broken down in the brain, there is some collateral damage to the dopamine neurons. You lose some every day.<br /><br />What does noradrenaline do?<br />AKA Norepinephrine (NE). NE is a hormone in addition to a neurotransmitter, this means it has a lot of different physical and mental effects. It constricts the blood vessels, increases heart rate and blood pressure, and puts one in an increased state of alertness (people often experience this as an anxious feeling and/or increased concentration ). Too much NE can result in some really bizarre effects like extreme horniness and obsessive thoughts/behaviors, and damage to the circulatory system. It works alongside adrenaline (AKA epinephrine) to regulate states of alertness/arousal. This is a vital part of your &quot;fight or flight&quot; response that you have probably heard mentioned before.<br /><br /><br /><br />Whats a reuptake inhibitor?<br />In your brain, scattered amongst your neurons, are little &quot;recycling units.&quot; They suck in excess brain chemicals that happen to be floating by, then break them down into their building blocks so they can be re-utilized as something else (or the same thing if needed). A reuptake inhibitor is a chemical that tends to &quot;bind&quot; to these recycling units, blocking them from sucking in anything. The result is an increased amount of a given brain chemical (called neurotransmitters). Each type of neurotransmitter has their own special recycling units. A reuptake inhibitor can bind to any or all of these depending on the physical structure of the chemical&#039;s molecule.<br /><br />Whats a releasing agent?<br />A releasing agent is a chemical that stimulates the release of a given neurotransmitter (into the &quot;synaptic gap&quot; of the neuron where it can be utilized). <br /><br />The Trip<br /><br />Tolerance: I have a permanent tolerance to both dopaminergic stimulants and opiates substances, for me this means that I have a minor tolerance of the positive effects and a high tolerance to the undesirable side effects of both drugs. However if I were to repeat using, my tolerance to the positive effects would very rapidly escalate within a week or two.<br /><br />Orally administered (lol) to myself the Adderall and DHC tablets at 12pm.<br />+15m First effects felt as a need to take a shit (&quot;coke dump&quot;), and a tingly faint excitement, interspersed with the faint warm happiness from the DHC.<br />+30m Coming up now quite a bit, about halfway to peak. Confidence, euphoria, energy, excitement, hunger disappeared, and in the background the DHC largely suppressed the nervous edge that would otherwise detract from the experience, while also providing that familiar sensation of your brain &quot;melting&quot; into a nice fuzzy mass of warmth.<br />+60m Peaking on both substances. Effects mentioned above are much more prominent, and I feel chatty and energetic, and am very happy with myself and my life. (but normally I am fairly happy with that stuff anyways). Also I have an uncontrollable urge to move one or more body parts (any) in a repetitive manner.&nbsp; Right now I&#039;m sprawled out on the couch and I&#039;m constantly tilting my bent knee from side to side in about a one-foot space. Its almost automatic. Its very nearly totally automatic, in fact. This is due to the effects that amphetamine has on the serotonin system, I may explain that later.<br />PLATEAU 90m to 300m and counting.<br />Why is this experience lasting so long? Its because of the synergy between amphetamine and my prescription drugs. I may make another post explaining a lil about that, if for no other reason than to occupy my speedy time.<br /><br />No, even though I&#039;m high I do not have any expectation of people reading through this :)

I would imagine the effect would only be permanent if enough LSD was around for long enough to effect LTP between the parts of the brain leading to a schizophrenic-like state.&nbsp; Even with &quot;TWO SHEETS of LSD&quot; wouldn&#039;t actue desenitization (tolerance) to the drug by the 5HT2A receptor prevent any permanent action like this?

Also to the michelle obama stalker, I just have to flat-out disagree, in fact to me all or nearly all dark black skinned girls are physically unattractive. Caramel, thats a different story.<br /><br />Also to LSD man:&nbsp; Thanks for your contribution. You came across one part of my rambling that was more based on anecdote than anything else. I can&#039;t make a counterpoint because I haven&#039;t done enough reading (although I wonder how much trustable data actually exists on long term effects of severe LSD overdose).
