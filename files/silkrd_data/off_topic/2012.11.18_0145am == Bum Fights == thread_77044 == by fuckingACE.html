				I have to agree. Manipulating probably the weakest people on this planet only makes you a big pussy, as in Jupiter big pussy. By weak I mean physically and psychically tired and ready to break apart any minute. Being addicted to a drug when you have no income and you live on the streets is fucked up already, taking advantage of it is just.....just human I guess, It defines us, it shows how pathetic and and ignorant we are. I think we deserve to suffer as species.<br /><br />Comparing heroin with alcohol is like comparing throwing a rock with launching a nuke at a town, in the same particular order

It´s the same as when you watch these taliban videos, there&#039;s one unarmed US soldier and 20 of these fucking squealing rag heads all jumping around him with rocket launchers, they put him in a field and bam shoot a rocket at him. To a lesser extent that&#039;s the look these tramps have on their faces. They know life has dealt them a shit card and they can do nothing about it. All the people that think its funny entertainment. You´re paying to see someone rip their teeth out for a crack rock. People being forced to beat the fuck out their friends so you can have a giggle. You would probably try and argue that its cool because they have a choice. But if you were poor and living on the street with nothing and a film crew offers you 200$ its no choice at all. <br />I don´t know if its the crappy way the world is that makes this enjoyable to some, or the fact that stuff like this makes the world shit. People laugh it off as just being another provocative TV program.. It´s not, its a measurement on how messed up some people are. It´s a bar that has been lowered. More and more people pay to enjoy homeless people suffer more, the people already at the bottom. I love fights, as a sport or as a fair way of resolving a dispute between two willing people, but not like this though.

				I agree. I&#039;m not sure why people find taking advantage of others amusing in any capacity. It sucks that there&#039;s such a social stigma against people who are homeless and that they aren&#039;t treated with the respect that any other human walking down the street would get&nbsp; :(
