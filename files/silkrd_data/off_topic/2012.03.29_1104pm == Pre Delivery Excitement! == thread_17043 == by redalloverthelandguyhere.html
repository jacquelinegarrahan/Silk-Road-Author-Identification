				I was thinking how buying drugs used to suck back in the day. Sure it was great in the 70s and 80s in the UK in some ways but far better to see the good hashes on the internet instead of having to go to Holland and usually come back with a rock stars crotch with the bag of hashes you &#039;forgot&#039; to smoke and persuade your woman that &#039;its ok really its barely even illegal (cough)&#039;<br /><br />Back in the 90s a few of us posted weed and hash we found to each other. No vacuum packed but almost all got through. Little bits mainly but people post it all the time. Plus if the UK mail stopped every envelope smelling of drugs there would be NO post and they know it. How many people snort a line - smoke a joint and handle drugs? Its all over money also.<br /><br />I am waiting for a bit of Afghan hash myself. Cannot wait to see this baby arrive and will be up early hugging the postman - my man! How you been! Hey there&#039;s my memory I ordered online!<br /><br />Deliver us from evil as it were.<br /><br />Its like waiting for a date. Butterfly in the stomach. Skins already waiting - wish we had a midnight post here!<br /><br />This could save the post service. We cannot email drugs.

				Lovely post. I recall with fondness my first delivery. I just sat down and stared at it for a bit with an uncontrollable stupid grin on my face. <br /><br />Imagine if technology advanced to the point when we could teleport drugs? Heh. <br /><br />For now, this method of using the mail system is just as lovely. The wait and anticipation has a pleasure all its own.

Plane, train and vehicle and by bicycle and foot. Delievered with precision often by a smiling postman which sets you up for the thrill to come. My postman smiled. Like he knew. Well a morning joint does that sometimes.<br /><br />But with some fantastic prices on 10 grams of hash it gets you thinking about how better it is priced at 20 grams or (leap) 50 grams! And butterfly in the stomach at the thought of 100 grams of lovely Afghan black hash.<br /><br />How was your first time?<br /><br />Did you rip open the envelope/package or go slowly and savor the moment?<br /><br />I was gentle myself. Wanted that shit to last and be remembered.<br /><br />And fees aside. BTC fees, post, waiting, it was worth it.<br /><br />Quality always is.

				My first delivery was years ago from an online pharmacy. It wasn&#039;t even that illegal, but I had to pick it up at the PO. I sat in the parking lot checking out the cars for ages. Finally I had it. I drove home, went into the garage, dropped the package in the garbage and sat in the house freaking out for hours. Then I got the package, opened it and have never looked back. Well a little, lol. I also find time is funny when you order something. I ordered something that was still processing and I was getting impatient. I thought I better check on it and when I looked at the order I realized I had only ordered it 2 days ago. Duh.
