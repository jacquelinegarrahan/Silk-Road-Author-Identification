				&nbsp;When you read a siz thousand word essay on a vendors page and still cant find out what you want to know before messaging them, and just knowing they will ignore it or give an answerless response, which ends up taking more time than if they had a vendor page that made sense in the first place.<br /><br />That fact that Bitcoin trading is more than likely rigged, as you will never pay under the mean average and the value will drop increasingly after youre already inflated purchase.<br /><br /><br />When you have a friend over discussing what weed you want, and as soon as he leaves, you open SR and the listing has been pulled.<br /><br /><br />Continue!

				Seems we all have about the same peeves.<br /><br />&quot;Leave feedback here&quot; is even more annoying than &quot;FE&quot;, cuz you know itll never be updated.<br /><br /><br /><br />People who complain about prices when other mail order dealers charge about 225% of what you pay here. (have you ever paid $180/qtr for 2nd shelf weed? people do it every day)<br /><br />People who consciously record foul language in word and expect to be viewed as a professional.<br /><br />People who get into knowledge wars or repeat ignorance on the INTERNET, where the true answer is 3 clicks away at all times.<br /><br />Bitcoin fluctuation stills tops my list though. Throwing away $100 every week has become a routine. Good listings disappear when the value goes up to what you paid.<br /><br />Bitcoin in general. I&#039;d rather deal in Yen than bitcoin. No one who cares about SR would care about bitcoin if they didnt have to.<br /><br />&#039;Reputable&#039; vendors who have OOE feedback listings and call you a scammer when you query about them.<br /><br />Vendors who split your orders into mutiple packages without nptice and make you look like a drug dealing asshole to the mailman.<br /><br />Return addresses of stores my mailman knows I would NEVER shop at.<br /><br />Single vacc&#039;ed weed packages<br /><br />RealUSDirect, because I can&#039;t get a buzz at all off his oily,fire, fishscale ephedrine powder.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
