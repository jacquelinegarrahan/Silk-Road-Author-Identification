				Hey all,<br />I feel foolish now for not reading Paxum&#039;s change in policy. As most of you know, they no longer deal with Mt.Gox per request of their parent bank or whomever. Well, I loaded an account from my card with $350 or so. When I finally got around to kicking myself in the ass for my mistake I called for a refund/filed a ticket BEFORE the funds were even withdrawn from my bank account. I was told by a representative the funds needn&#039;t be removed from my account and that they would just cancel the transaction.&nbsp; <br /><br />After having dealt with Dwolla and such I understand these types of transfers can take a bit of time. However, it has been nearly a full week since their tech team informed me that they had returned the funds to my debit card and there is still no sign of the money that they DID end up taking out of my account. <br /><br />I am beginning to worry. Has anyone had experiences with refunds from Paxum? I&#039;m not sure what to expect, or what recourse I have if things go awry. <br /><br />Any input would be greatly appreciated!<br />
