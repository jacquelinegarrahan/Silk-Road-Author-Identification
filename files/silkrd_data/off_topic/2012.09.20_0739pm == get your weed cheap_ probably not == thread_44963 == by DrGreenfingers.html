				sounds a bit like that StExo who was running his mouth off on the forums a while back promising super cheap weed, he was looking for a programmer to make him an onion website.<br /><br />i have no evidence to proove he is a scammer but he was offering £30k for someone to build him a site, considering he could have paid £100 for a sellers account on silkroad and sold plenty of gear at those prices, that he has gone off-site means there is something to do with SR that he meant he could not conduct his business, which i assume is escrow, and that means he is intending to scam.<br /><br />
