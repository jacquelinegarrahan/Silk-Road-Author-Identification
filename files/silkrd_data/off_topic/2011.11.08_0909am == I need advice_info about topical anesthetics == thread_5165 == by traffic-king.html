				hi everyone.<br /><br />i&#039;m not actually new to silk road, i created a separate account to post this because it is mortifying. i have had infected ingrown toenails on both my big toes for years. i&#039;ve been to the doctor and had them fixed, but they came back not even 3 months after that. i am so completely terrified to go back to the doctor because he injected anesthesia into the joints of my toes which was arguably the most painful thing i have ever felt, and on 1 toe he had to do it 3 times because it wasn&#039;t working. not only am i far too afraid to return to a doctor, i cannot afford another surgery.<br /><br />i am looking for information about topical anesthetics, because i want to fix it myself. i have tried before, and i have succeeded before without anesthetic, but one toe has gotten so bad it&#039;s excruciatingly painful to even put on socks. there&#039;s no way i can take a razor blade to it like this, so i really need some kind of numbing agent.<br />i know things like benzocaine and lidocaine are sold over the counter, but do you guys think those are strong enough for the procedure i&#039;m hoping to preform? are there ANY topical anesthetics that are strong enough for this?<br />even if you don&#039;t think there are, i intend to try literally anything.<br /><br /><br />please help me, any information is appreciated.

				I have no experience but I do not think that a topical anesthetic is going to help you. It specifically refers to the surface of the body. What you are inquiring about I believe is a local anesthetic, however I am no medical professional. Possibly ask the doctor if he can numb the injection site with a topical anesthetic prior to the injection? <br /><br />If you are dead set on doing it at home the synthetic local anesthetics are modeled off cocaine but I believe this would still involve needles for effective numbness. Mixing the topical and local may be dangerous, although I really am not sure.<br /><br />Probably best left to a professional. Good luck

				As mRNA states you&#039;re looking for a local anesthetic - topical won&#039;t do anything for the pain. This is something you&#039;ll have to inject using needles so that&#039;s an issue you&#039;ll have to deal with.<br /><br />If you&#039;re anxious about having the same procedure done again by a physician then take some benzos and painkillers before the operation! But you state that you can&#039;t afford it so the same advice applies; you&#039;ll want to be drugged up before putting yourself under the knife.<br /><br />I&#039;ve picked up small vials of anesthetic from doctor&#039;s offices and once from an ER room. They&#039;re not kept under lock and key so if you&#039;re ever left alone in a waiting room, start checking some drawers and cabinets. <br /><br />Speaking of which, if you need a sterile scalpel I can hook you up! (PM me.)

				You cannot seriously think that the results of home surgery will be any better than what a doctor would provide.<br />I know in some countries you have to pay out of pocket for this stuff, but if you keep getting infections, then it is VERY likely your immune system is compromised in some way, and this will lead to another infection and possible death.<br /><br />Good luck, and stay safe!

				By definition, local anesthetics are referred to as topical anesthetics when they are used to numb the surface. So you can use the same compound if you choose the right one. Just make sure you research safe dosages. <br /><br />If you are going to do it yourself, get the STERILE scalpel and needle/syringe, and purchase painkillers and a regiment of antibiotics (on SR). Research the correct number of doses each day and how long you must take it. You can get an even worse resistant infection if you stop taking them too soon.<br /><br />Some RC suppliers have dimethocaine which is a local anesthetic analogue of cocaine. Some people abuse the substance IV but it is very hard on the heart. If you find a pure source you may be able to use it. It wont be sterile though but you could use micron filters at a minimum.

				Yeah, many of the topical/locals are cocaine based.<br />I guess you could use coke itself, technically speaking.<br />You could dissolve it in some saline, apply to the wound and then inject some around the site, but you would want it to be injection-safe quality, and you wouldn&#039;t want to hit a major vein or you might be flying too hard to perform the surgery.
