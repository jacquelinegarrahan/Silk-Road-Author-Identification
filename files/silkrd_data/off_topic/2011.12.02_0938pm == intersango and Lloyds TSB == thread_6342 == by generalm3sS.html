				Hey,<br /><br />Just to let people know, If you take money to Lloyds TSB the money is in pretty much the same day. Intersango it is anyways. Now thats a fast way of getting BTC :)

				No, you take cash into Lloyds and put the cash into the intersango&#039;s account. The money is then debited to your intersango account within about 5 hours and then you can buy BTC.

The fact is banks aren&#039;t going be the best compliant with BTC market cause it has the potential to see them out of business so i expect things not to run smoothly ALL the time. And the charge is minimal and i hope it helps keep the service top notch now. I suspect there pay ins may have been to get the extra 0.65% off transactions but im guessing we&#039;ll never know :)<br /><br />Being able pay it in relatively anonymously is pretty sweet too :)

On a brighter note, Most banks have cash in points but be warned, They are not collected until the end of day and wont be processed by the bank until the next working day if you do use the post boxes ;)

				iNTERSANGO IS AMAZINGLY EFFICIENT IN MY EXPERIENCE. iF i DEPOSIT IN THE MORNING THEN BY MIDNIGHT MY MONEY IS READY. (Sorry about caps lock but I am too lazy to rewrite it)<br />After 12 pm then it is in by 5pm the following day. Their support email is very efficient and i think they respond from the West Coast of the US and it takes a little bit of time for a respond but they are a professional and efficient organization.

				I have never heard of or used Intersango until I saw this thread, but I might give it a try next time. I normally use Mtgox (US based I think) who&#039;s service is flawless and sounds similar to Intersango.. the transaction charge is a very reasonable 0.6% and there is no fee to deposit or withdraw funds, at least not for GBP anyway. They have a bank account with Barclays Bank in the UK and several others around the world for all the major currencies. I usually get my deposits showing within 24 hours.

				Intersango is the shit. Quick, easy and anonymous. (Well except for walking into a bank filled with cameras.) Ah well, swings and roundabouts eh?

The fees they&#039;re charging now are minuscule as well.<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you expected them to run like an ordinary business when they&#039;re not making any money. These people have lives of their own you know. <br /><br />Amir, the guy behind intersango is an absolute beast. The work his does, the countless interviews he&#039;s been doing (usually in defence of Bitcoin). This is a revolutionary figure in the making. Thank fuck us Brits have a UK based bitcoin exchange is all I can say and I genuinely trust these people. If a transfer takes 3 days, fuck it, it takes 3 days. I greatly appreciate the work they do.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This.
