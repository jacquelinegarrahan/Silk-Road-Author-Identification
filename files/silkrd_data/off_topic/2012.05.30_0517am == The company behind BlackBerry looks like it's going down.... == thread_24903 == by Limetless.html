				Where did you see this lim? They used to be the shit before all these legit smart phones. <br /><br />I felt like they honestly stop trying to play catch up with Ios and Android. I&#039;ve seen and played with their So called iphone killers and they blew balls. So i&#039;m not at all surprised to see them go under.<br /><br />Just shows if your not willing to adapt you wont make it in this world

Basically the company is in financial straights and they look like they could be getting bought. BlackBerry was only decent back in the day when there was nothing better. Now iOS and Android are here they teabag pedophiles.

				iPhones are fucking overpriced as fuck but if you can afford one, congratulations, you have an awesome phone!<br />I have a Samsung Galaxy Ace. I rooted the fucker, now it runs Android with a heavily modified user interface and I also made it run Debian Linux which is mad rad if you ask me. That shit would not be possible with an iPhone ;D

Never ever going back to Windows. But for phone I still prefer android over iOS.. not sure why. Maybe because Android phones are a lot more durable than iOS ones.. few of mine friends have iPhones but they had their screen break a few times already now. My phone dropped on the floor like a hundred times and hardly has a scratch (Xperia X10)

				I love my iPhone. When I first got it 3 months ago I was skeptical if it&#039;d be so much like the iPod but now no doubt, it&#039;s the best! As for computers though, I&#039;m stuck with a Toshiba :P<br />Also Knomo, my friend had an Android and dropped his phone about 15 feet on accident and stepped on it. The screen had no scratches whatsoever and he stepped on it hard! You&#039;ve got to give Android that...
