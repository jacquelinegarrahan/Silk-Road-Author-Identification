				Okay so i used intersango to do my BTC bidding for ages.&nbsp; Recently i told you guys i found 50 quid in my account.&nbsp; Completely forgetting about it, i discovered it again and though fuck me i need that 50 quid.&nbsp; So i tried to make a transfer from Intersango and guess what, 24 hours later and technical problems and now it looks like they are going out of business.<br /><br />They even left a warming message along the lines of &quot;We hope the future of Bitcoins goes well!&quot;<br /><br />Learn from this lesson guys.&nbsp; I wont be using any fucking bank for BTC any time soon! &gt;:(

				Adasel, don&#039;t think it was you who fucked up mate, rumours on the SR and other Tor forums and look like it was connected to some irresponsible member contacting Metro Bank for a refund when one of their SR orders didn&#039;t show - dunno how accurate this is.&nbsp; Are you still able to buy BTC til end of month?&nbsp; Can you withdraw BTC or is your account frozen/unable to pay out?&nbsp; Also - any other reliable BTC exchanges in UK or that accept GBP that you or anyone else is aware of?&nbsp;

				If it was £ (GBP) you were trying to transfer they are only doing these transfers on business days now (and Monday was a bank holiday in the UK).<br />If it was Bitcoins, then yet again Intersango has fucked up.

				I&#039;ve always found Intersango to be very reliable. If they are winding up their UK operations they will be sorely missed.

				Frankly I found Intersango a bit shit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I ever had a payment credited in less than 3 days, they kept trying to point the finger of blame at the customer saying &quot;your bank didn&#039;t send the ref no., we may have to start charging for that&quot; even though any ref I added made it to 3 other major banks ok.<br /><br />They were at the end of the day a very amateur outfit, it&#039;s the sort of thing that a couple of decent developers could knock together (to that standard) in under a month.

				Yeah i thought totally the same thing the first time around when they were late on a payment.&nbsp; But hey im too honest and decided to give them a shot.<br />The question remains though, where do we go now for Bitcoins?

				Mt Gox has a deposit facility for GBP - but looks like it&#039;ll take 3-4 days to process<br /><br />bitmarket.eu looks promising - with direct transfers between traders and buyers, and BTC held in an escrow-type facility until your money reaches the trader&#039;s account - but mark-up on BTCs for GBP at the moment is fucking ridiculous (probably cos intersango can&#039;t process GBP deposits) at around £8-10 per BTC (having dropped to £6.50-7.00 after recent peak).<br /><br />I liked intersango and never had more than one deposit take more than 24hrs, and when it did tech support manually imported it overnight.&nbsp; Maybe a EUR account within your current bank, as you could continue to make deposits to intersango via SEPA?<br /><br />I&#039;m looking at all of these and a few more - if any get positive results I&#039;ll post back.

				Thanks for looking into this mate.&nbsp; This helps out hugely.<br />As for intersango though, one fuck up is one fuck up too many i am afraid.&nbsp; I know we all make mistakes but these guys wanted to make a mark on an international scale.<br />All those others that you mentioned i will definitely take a look at though.<br />Once again, thanks bro.
