				Not to shit on your thread but just to share opinions I dunno if I like songs that are overtly about drugs. It always feels like you are being told how to feel.&nbsp; :-\

Truth be told nobody can tell you how you really feel but yourself, however, sometimes I feel I can really relate to some of the tracks that I listen to, like &#039;Wow! I can really realte to that&#039; moment of light, somebody understands, I don&#039;t feel so alone now, which can be a very uplifting feeling. Feel free to add your tracks or dicuss this, this thread can swing both ways :)

				Cool. There are some exceptions to the rule but most &quot;drug songs&quot; just annoy me rather than entertain me. I prefer music that can make you feel great when you&#039;re on drugs rather than music that tells you to do them. For example, Jimmy Hendrix song Purple Haze. Why the fuck are you singing about a plant? It&#039;s just a fucking plant. Drugs shouldn&#039;t be glorified or made to look cool in that way, it&#039;s just a bullshit culture that to be frank, is just a subliminal form of advertising that puts money in drug dealers pockets.

				I genuinely like Shpongle and the way they sound on psychedelics. I don&#039;t like songs with vocals that sing about drugs though, just stuff that sounds good ON drugs.

				My bet would be 99% of all the music we hear is drug inspired.

I really feel like people need to stop giving so much importance and mystery to drugs. Let common people stop holding it in fucking limelight, just do it and get over it, and incorporate them into your lifestyles if you want, why do u have to inform everyone of your use? <br /><br />Back to topic, i love psychedelic music.I have not listened to my old genres (rock, alternative, classic) for almost 2 years. Absurd said sphongle, which is beautiful. I listen to goa trance, psy trance, ambient, uplifting. I am expanding my music horizons. I used to hate psy man, but over a year of acid tripping, its like that music holds deep deep meaning for me :P

				best music on drugs is without, or hardly any, vocals<br />it&#039;s all about the sounds<br /><br />unless...unless you feel like singing your heart out

				There&#039;s a difference between music which is good listening to while on drugs and music which is about drug use. It is hard to tell if the music was inspired my drugs unless the lyrics reveal that it was (or the makers say it was).
