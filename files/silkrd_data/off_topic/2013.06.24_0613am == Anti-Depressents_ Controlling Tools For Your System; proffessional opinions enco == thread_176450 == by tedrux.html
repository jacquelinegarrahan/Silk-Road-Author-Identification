				I got a theory : I don&#039;t think mental health professionals WANT you to get better. it&#039;s bad for business. plus they tend to be pretty sick themselves putting all their hurts on others and making themselves feel better with a superiority complex. and OMG the price of pills make me want to put a bullit in my head. the fact is that for all this &#039;treatment&#039; there is no cure! oftain treatment makes you worse off! its questionable if &#039;being you&#039;is curable or if it even should be attempted but fuck it.&nbsp; although RTMS seems promising and so does downers and hypnotism.

				ted, I have often thought similar things. I have many mental health issues. ADD, Depression, severe social anxiety (xanax help), and a list more from Stanford medical center in Ca. I have come to realize after being put on just about every anti-depressant and stimulant, none of them work!<br />Until one day I found opioids.<br />It seemed to fix all my ailments! I focus better, work harder, love more, become super sociable, and of course I&#039;m not depressed because of the (euphoria).<br />I even explained this to a doctor a few years back and he agreed to prescribe me some fairly heavy opioids to see if my theory was correct. (guess I was his Guinea Pig) Lets just say he kept me on the same prescription for about 2 years till I moved.&nbsp; <br />Never tried hypnotism.

				lol @ drool wut? NICE bro.<br /><br />You are right though. after I moved (almost across the country) It was all new diagnostics. None of which seemed to match even with my records sitting right in front of them.

				Dear Therapists,<br />You have seemed to have a great ammount of trouble diagnosing me accurately so I thought I&#039;d give&nbsp; you a little help. You see, what is wrong with me is I am a rational human being. however this world only fits irrational humna beings who utterly fail at critical thinking. Being that I am a herd animal without a place in the community nor any peers I was THUS drove to irrational thinking built off from my rational mind. This being completely different from the blind dellussions of the common man&nbsp; you came to call this insanity. In summation what is wrong with me is that I can think. All prior medications have failed to cure this condition and so I shall breifly be requesting a lead pill administered at high volocity to my frontal cortex. Thank you for your time and consideration, I KNOW you have many &#039;important&#039; things to do (yes, I DO suppose that the little white ball will not wack itsself...) sincerely, <br />teddy<br />ps. fuck you very much and have a wonderful day
