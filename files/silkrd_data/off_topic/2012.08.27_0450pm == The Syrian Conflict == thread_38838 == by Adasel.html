				I think each case (war or conflict) should be looked at differently.&nbsp; I am glad that other countries got involved in WWII.&nbsp; Involvement should have taken place in Rwanda.&nbsp; But in Lybia, Vietnam, and possibly Syria, involvement could prove pointless, as you are simply changing one evil regime with another.

				I don&#039;t trust what the media says. It tells us what our government wants us to think. It shouldn&#039;t be up to America to police the world but it is I guess since they are the super power of the world. There&#039;s a lot of people that need help here instead of our taxes going to help rebuild one country after another. WW2 was definately a good reason to get involved with hitler trying to take over the world and all. And of course bin laden had to die along with those who were responsible for crashing into the towers. Fact is I might not like you and you might not like me but we will both stand up for one another&#039;s freedoms as Americans against tyranny like those stupid fucks and really we should help the weaker folks. As a super power it is our resposibility to take up for those who are not able to fight. There is a very high price for freedom.

War can sometimes be a very profitable exercise, especially for the private contractors sent in after an invasion.

				Have any of you even been in Syria? I visited the country a couple of times before all hell broke loose there, and I must say it used to be a pretty pleasant country to be in at the time. <br /><br />The situation there has always been a bit tense between government, muslim extremists and christian minorities though. Under the rule of Assad it certainly was a police state, but he managed to keep the internal peace for many years despite all the differences. You may feel like supporting the rebellion in its fight against a dictator, but if they take control over syria the outcome may be very bad for a large number of people. Alawites and christians will likely not be spared if assad is overthrown. You can see him has an evil dictator or great stabilizer depending on which team you are with. but i have no doubt this rebellion will cost more lives then his continued position in power there.<br /><br />American intervention will probably not be appreciated at all since most people there will look upon it as an Israeli ally invading their country, regardless which side the us ends up aiding.

				The US thinks it&#039;s ok to invade peoples shit and kill them for oil, or revenge, or to &quot;prevent communism,&quot; but to want to actually do good in a situation where the government forces are actually killing babies and raping women in an effort to root out the so called &quot;terrorists.&quot;&nbsp; Naw, fuck that shit, let them fuck the innocent, it&#039;s not my problem.<br />Rebels don&#039;t have clean hands either, but they aren&#039;t massacring children.<br /><br />The US generally sticks up for it&#039;s own interests, and has no problem flexing arms when their interests are at stake.<br />Rwanda, Bosnia, etc. all could have been mitigated with a show of the &#039;ol &quot;shock and awe.&quot;<br />Suffering is everyone&#039;s problem.&nbsp; It creates terrorists, and broken lives. <br />Shouldn&#039;t the world agenda be the happiness, health and contentment of all, instead of buy this, sell that?<br />Shouldn&#039;t someone with the weaponry to say, &quot;fuck off and start using diplomacy, assholes&quot;, do something?<br />

The U.S. is probably paying citizens to uprise and you cannot trust a god damn word the media says about Assad.<br />Stop being so naive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1000000000000000000<br /><br />US is funding and arming the same people in Syria that they are fighting in Afghanistan, but you don&#039;t hear this fact on mainstream news.

				I don&#039;t need a tinfoil hat to tell me what to think, any more than I need the government.<br />You&#039;re assuming I&#039;m against everything you&#039;re saying... I&#039;m not.&nbsp; Of course corporate interests and big Gov. don&#039;t give a shit.&nbsp; What I&#039;m saying is culturally, the West cares, even if it&#039;s only for 15 minutes between news stories and ads about bounce dryer sheets.<br /><br />What evidence do you have that proves we shouldn&#039;t go there and help?&nbsp; Russian news?&nbsp; Guffaw.&nbsp; There are no real news sources for this conflict... but when someone cuts off all communications into and out of their country, it becomes painfully obvious they have something to hide.&nbsp; Our government does insidious things, but they don&#039;t massacre entire villages of their own civilians just to find a few rebels. We actually have several armed militia groups in the US and Canada, that are free to believe what they want and stockpile guns for &quot;the day&quot; they get to use them.&nbsp; We only confront those wacos when they start hurting people. (Yes that was an intentional typo for effect)<br /><br />It&#039;s not like we&#039;re going to nuke them to stop this, but we might be able to help.<br />Iraq was a clusterfuck because Bush is a clusterfuck, and thought folks wouldn&#039;t notice it was all for oil and legacy.&nbsp; His relationship to the Bin Ladens and his grandfathers&#039; to the Nazis is not to be ignored.<br />Did they bring down the WTC to help initiate the war?&nbsp; I dunno, but there are some fishy questions waiting to be answered.&nbsp; Even if you are doing good, if your intentions are bad karma will get you, that&#039;s why Iraq is a shitstorm of epoch proportions.&nbsp; Things in Afghanistan were getting a lot better, until we started to pull our troops.&nbsp; The taliban is starting to move back into their old ways, but at least the Afghan people are making an effort to police themselves.&nbsp; Afghanistan is a country that has dealt with invaders long before even the Brits were there, they will be there long after we leave.<br /><br />Syria is hardly part of a plot for world domination though, look to China or the EU/German state for that. Syrian oil is We all think it&#039;s terrible, but nobody want to do something about it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen people ignore poverty and filth in our own streets. The universal truth is 99% of the world just wants to be loved, and the other 1% are psychotics bent on destroying the possibility of peace and love for all.<br /><br />So yea, lots of bad shit going on in the world.&nbsp; The sad thing is when people give up trying to counter the bad with the good.&nbsp; If everyone gives up, like you have, evil will triumph, worldwide.<br /><br />The occupy movement is a good example of how governments are treating folks these days.&nbsp; Our democracies are eroding, but at the same time our youth is finally seeing that protests need to be done, it is our democratic responsibility.&nbsp; 50 calls to a congressman from civilians don&#039;t carry the same weight as a single call from a CEO.<br /><br />@Brave: How are the west or the UN terrorists or worse than?&nbsp; I think you need to look up the definition.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see blue hats marching through anyone&#039;s streets with their cocks out.&nbsp; The UN is ineffectual because they&#039;ve given countries, like the US, China and Russia veto powers.&nbsp; It&#039;s useless if no one is allowed to follow majority rule, but must appease the veto countries just to pass a resolution.&nbsp; Tell me one thing the UN has ever done to effect your quality of life directly.<br /><br />@Sixteen:&nbsp; I told you I was going to jump on the generalization bandwagon.&nbsp; To not see that different cultures have different beliefs and ideas is pretty shortsighted.&nbsp; I work with people from around the world, and the general feeling I get about the east, directly from folks from eastern countries, is that life is not respected, unless it is your own, your families, or friends.&nbsp; Even then there are exceptions.&nbsp; I had a man tell me just the other day, when I said I wanted to visit India, that I should not go there, ever.&nbsp; He said that there is so much violence and filth it would be a waste of my life.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I don&#039;t really believe it&#039;s that extreme, but he must have his reasons for feeling so pessimistic about his homeland.<br /><br />I have nothing against anyone of any colour or religion.&nbsp; We are all here together.&nbsp; Our culture isn&#039;t so shit hot either, but force feeding ourselves to death with ding dongs and TV isn&#039;t as bad as growing up in an area where you might find clean water by the end of it, and you have soldiers trying to play duck hunt with your brother.&nbsp; To not think living in fear of death constantly will not effect people is just silly.&nbsp; Israel fucked up by ghettoizing the Palestinians, and have created generations of people living under their thumb who have nothing to live for but a bomb.<br /><br />I&#039;m not blind to this shit, but I&#039;m not jaded enough to be so paranoid as to believe everyone is out to get me either.

				Actually Aleppo is a strong pro-government city. The real terrorists that are murdering women and children and babies chose it for a strategic reason. If they can overthrow Aleppo the rest will fall in behind them. To anyone with a reasonable degree of intelligence and the skills to fact check the information it is plain to see. Now that this thing has drug out and played itself into a corner we should at least do a partial examination. Let&#039;s look at the &#039;rebels&#039; and their supporters. If you search the archives you will find stories placing Al-Qaeda(Al-CIAduh), the zionist terror state&nbsp; of Izrahell, America and Egypt on the same side. All of them calling for regime change? Are you fucking kidding me? This bullshit line about &#039;SEAL team 6&#039; capping Bin Laden is nothing but fucking propaganda. Osama died in a hospital, or thereabouts, in Rawalpindi. The same place the ISI, CIA, and Mossad first brainstormed Al-CIAduh. It was also the place where Benezir Bhutto was assassinated and also David Pearl who was getting a little too close to the money trail of 9/11, and ya&#039;ll were dumb enough to think he was killed for being a &#039;Jew&#039;.<br /><br />Here is the definition of terrorism:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">ter·ror·ism&nbsp; audio&nbsp; (tr-rzm) KEY <br /><br />NOUN:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now you tell me WHO has practiced this exact definition verbatim more than the United States? America trumpets that they are overthrowing dictators and &#039;evil&#039; regimes, and they replace it with what? A fucking tinpot dictator that paves the way for multinational corporations to harvest all of the natural resources that particular country has. They exploit the labor and reduce the population to beggary. In whose fucking book does that equate to &#039;democracy&#039;? America &#039;invades&#039; these countries so we can &#039;free&#039; them. What a bunch of racist motherfuckers. Show me any nation America has invaded and set up a healthy &#039;democratic&#039; structure and economy where the people have control over their nation and the government. Get the fuck outta here. <br /><br />I have heard people refer to the &#039;Free Syria Army&#039; as the Syrian FREE Army because there isn&#039;t any fucking Syrians in it. Just like that peckerwood piece of shit that just released the book about the Osama &#039;assassination&#039;. It&#039;s nothing but motherfucking propaganda to keep you from understanding the REAL shit that is taking place every day, with your tax dollars, in your name, with you sons, daughters, moms, dads, uncles, aunts. Why are people so fucking stupid they can&#039;t see who the real enemy is? They&#039;re so mindfucked they&#039;re ecstatic about getting the chance to &#039;elect&#039; another impotent, sterile, piece of shit that has no power to rescue America, the economy, their jobs, or any thing else.<br /><br />Not intended to be &#039;at&#039; you Adasel. Just my perspective.
