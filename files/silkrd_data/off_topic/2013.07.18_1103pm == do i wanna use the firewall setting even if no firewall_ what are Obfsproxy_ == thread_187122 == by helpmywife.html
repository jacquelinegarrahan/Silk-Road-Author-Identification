				Obfsproxy is an obfuscated(encrypted/concealed data) tor bridge.<br /><br />Your ISP and any other eavesdropping eyes on your traffic can clearly see that you use TOR, TOR is encrypted so they can&#039;t see WHAT you&#039;re doing only that you&#039;re a user of tor.<br /><br />Bridges will conceal this by connecting from your IP, to the bridge, and then onto tor. For the ISP or eavesdropping entity they will only be able to see that you&#039;re connecting to the address. This, however can only be used to bypass very weak TOR censorship. Countries like China and Iran use DPI(deep packet inspection) to hyperanalyze the traffic going from your IP to the bridge, since the bridge is not obfuscated they can still see that there is TOR traffic if they are really trying hard enough.<br /><br /><br />This is where Obfsproxy comes in. It is a better bridge and can be used to circumvent censorship in countries that use DPI. It&#039;s like a normal bridge except the traffic going to and from the bridge is encrypted and obfuscated in order to not appear as TOR traffic. Using Obfsproxy you can be assured that you can bypass censorship.<br /><br />This also makes it so that your IP will not be identified as a TOR user, as if you are a tor user I&#039;m sure you&#039;re on some sort of watchlist in countries like the USA.<br /><br />If you take security seriously you should use it, the less ISPs and watching eyes know the better and it is very simple and straigh-forward to setup.

				yes to both, i recommend WFC (windows fire control) or Comodo Firewall for your firewall needs.
