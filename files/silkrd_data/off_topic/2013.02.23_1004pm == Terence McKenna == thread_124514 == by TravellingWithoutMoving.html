				It&#039;s going to take a few generations, in my opinion.<br />I&#039;m fairly young, but I can definitely see a change happening. Not sure if it will happen in my lifetime (not that I&#039;m planning on living to 100 or anything...)<br />I think (at least in the US) if things keep going the way they are, huge things are going to start happening, and people are going to start making some changes (hopefully).<br />But yeah, good quote.

				“Our culture, self-toxified by the poisonous by-products of technology and egocentric ideology, is the unhappy inheritor of the dominator attitude that alteration of consciousness by the use of plants or substances is somehow wrong, onanistic, and perversely antisocial. I will argue that suppression of shamanic gnosis, with its reliance and insistence on ecstatic dissolution of the ego, has robbed us of life’s meaning and made us enemies of the planet, of ourselves, and our grandchildren. We are killing the planet in order to keep intact the wrongheaded assumptions of the ego-dominator cultural style.”

				it has to do with a sense. the sense of reality. <br />&nbsp;as we get older we start to get locked up into beliefs inside our heads. reality becomes surrounded with a firmly standing brick wall.<br />this is a natural process. minds don&#039;t age like fine wine. <br />the only way out is to shatter this wall. psychedelics can do that. <br />The problem is that most ppl are satisfied with their little own worlds and don&#039;t want to experience new ones.&nbsp; Its caused by mixture of fear and laziness. That is what you have to get rid of if we want to change yourself. <br /><br />

				its more a disconnect with nature<br />don&#039;t value what animal and plant life have to offer<br />world view is to use and consume every living thing in the name of progress<br />too ignorant and proud to admit we already had solutions, instead on building on thousands of yrs of experience we&#039;ll conquer..(and consume)<br /><br /><br />Peace<br />TWM<br />&nbsp;

All they do is destroy to survive!<br />&nbsp;Consume and consume and consume. Its one of the first genetic commands. Every living creature that thrives on other creatures has this urge. <br />&nbsp;breaking free from this would cause the ending of human civilization. The end of space exploration. the end of globalization. the urge to press forward and create new would disappear. Huxley talked about this in one of his books where he discusses mescaline. <br />Psychedelic states are fantastic, but if we would see reality like that always, that would be the end for us. The filters are there for a reason. <br /><br />I think the world needs special leaders. honest and open minded shamans.

				know the phrase &quot;stop acting like an animal&quot; or &quot;dont treat them like animals&quot;, some of our actions we might as well be climbing trees.<br /><br />we&#039;ve assumed an animal being less evolved or &quot;intelligent&quot; doesnt deserve the same treatment (as humans).<br /><br /><br />difference is we know better.<br /><br /><br />Peace<br />TWM

				<br />“The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#039;s real because that&#039;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#039;s very brightly colored, and it&#039;s very loud, and it&#039;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#039;t worry; don&#039;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#039;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It&#039;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#039;t matter, because it&#039;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#039;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#039;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.<br />- Bill Hicks<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />TWM<br />
