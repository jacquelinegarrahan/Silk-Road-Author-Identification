				After seeing how very few experience reports there are on erowid and other sites about taking 25x-nbome at&nbsp; high doses, I decided I would share my experience with ~10mg of 25i-nbome vaporized/smoked. Now, do keep in mind that this took place more than 1½ months ago, so my memory of the experience is a bit spotty, but I will do my best to remember all I can.<br /><br />I obtained some 25i-nbome for from a vendor on a forum (he has since stopped selling). I was told it was in hydrochloride salt form, but a solubility test showed it was in freebase form. I read the big &amp; dandy 25i thread on bluelight and it seems that nearly everyone who ordered 25i in powder form, regardless of who it was purchased from, was freebase. Also, in that thread, I read a report of a person smoking/vaporizing 450mcg of freebase 25i with glowing results. Now I knew the route of administration I would take.<br /><br />Now, I have always been one of those people who want to experience the most a drug can offer. After reading all of the experience reports I could find, it seems a common dose is around 2.5mg buccal and 1-1.5mg snorted/IM. I had already taken 2 trips at those doses (buccal) thanks to ENBOOM and was extremely pleased, but still wanted more. <br /><br />Now onto the good part. I measured out ~10mg as best I could with the help of a friends jewelry scale. If I had access to hydrochloric acid or hpbcd I would have used a liquid measure technique. I placed the dose in a glass ball vaporizer (meth/crack pipe, but I don&#039;t like to call it that). I used a torch lighter to heat and vaporize the dose. I held the hit in for about 5 seconds and exhaled. About 10 seconds later, everything started to...change. The usual tracers and color distortion started to come on extremely heavily. Then everything started to... for the lack of a better term, breathe. Everything was increasing and decreasing in size as if it had lungs. The colors and lights flashed everytime everything &quot;breathed&quot;, like watching a movie in slide show form, if that makes any sense. I also noticed a very loud sound that was oscillating (I&#039;m not sure if this is the correct term to describe it) like a fan that was speeding up and vibrating in its case. If I was a audio engineer I&#039;m sure I could create the sound I herd but I&#039;m not, so bare with me. The &quot;sound&quot; was an auditory hallucination, something I NEVER encountered in an experience report of coming from a 25i trip. The sound just kept getting louder and oscillating at different speeds. I noticed I could control it somewhat if I just thought about what frequency I wanted the sound to oscillate at.<br /><br />By now, the visuals were extremely... extreme. I kept thinking that even if I layed down and tried to sleep, the visuals, sounds, and minf-fuck would follow me. There was no escape from this trip. My stomach felt like it was the size of a walnut and desperately pushing itself out of my body. The best way I can describe it was the feeling you get right before you puke where your stomach is in your throat, only twice as bad.<br /><br />After just standing and looking around for what I think was ~3 minutes, I tried to walk into my bathroom. I say tried because it felt like I forget how to walk. I eventually managed to tip-toe like a girl in high heels to my bathroom. The lights weren&#039;t on, but I had a small neon clock nearby that provided enough light just see where the doorknob was. I went into the bathroom, closed the door, and just tried not to puke. It completely slipped my mind that I had to turn on the lights if I wanted to see anything. My thoughts kept cycling between, &quot;I should lock the bathroom door&quot; (I live with 2 other tenants in a house), &quot;oh god I&#039;m gonna puke&quot;, and &quot;holy shit, this is the heaviest I have ever tripped&quot;. I did puke once. It wasn&#039;t a projectile vomit like you see in so many bars. It was more like having something very bad tasting in your mouth and spitting it up quickly. After that it took me more than 5 minutes to figure out light switch=light and when I did turn on the light, I saw what I assumed to be my puke in the sink (I had already forgotten I had puked). I managed to clean that up as best I could. I washed my hands and noticed that even after I had thoroughly washed and dried them, they still felt sticky - like semi-dry sweat. I still don&#039;t know if they were wet or not; I couldn&#039;t exactly rely on my eyes to tell me if my hands were shiny with sweat.<br /><br />I eventually made it upstairs to my computer room. It was early morning, about 2-3 a.m. so I only had a nightlight to guide me. I made my way up the stairs and past one of my sleeping roomies and found myself trying to very quietly open the door to my computer room without waking my roomie. I felt around for the frame of the door and then for the doorknob. Eventually I got the door open and sat myself down in front of my computer. <br /><br />From my previous experiences, I found that visually stimulating games/movies/videos/anything to be orgasmic. I played, well tried to play super mario 64, mario kart, f zero, torus trooper, proun, and diablo 2. I was too focused on how awesome the visuals were rather than actually playing the game. Then I started to play, what I still say to this day is the best game to play on any psychedelic; beat hazard ultra. If you don&#039;t know what that game is like, it is an asteroids-based game using songs to craft different waves of baddies and bosses. Google it if you want to see what it looks like.<br /><br />Each song I played became what I was and how I felt. To put that another way, The song I was listening to determined what mood/mindset I was in. If I played some jimi hendrix, I felt so calm and easy going. If I played disturbed, I felt motivated, energetic, powerful. If I played ulrich schnauss, I felt like I was floating through space, gazing down upon the world from god&#039;s holy fanny-pack. I still couldn&#039;t really play the game as such, but I could enjoy the massive visuals I had. After about 1 to 1½ hours of playing that game, some clarity came to me as I was able to now actually play the game well; trying to beat my previous scores instead of gazing at the colorful screen. I realized I must be on the come-down of the trip. I still had awesome visuals and MUCH less mind-fuck. I could walk normally and have a semi-intelligent comversation with a person without them wanting to call me an ambulance because they thought I had overdosed on something. I still had the stomach-in-the-throat feeling, but I told myself that it was just a feeling that comes with the drug and that I wasn&#039;t going to puke again; and I didn&#039;t. <br /><br />I continued to play that game for about another 1½ hours until I decided to take another dose of the same size. I had previously read on bluelight about the insanely quick tolerance buildup with nbomes. This proved to be true. I vaporized another 10mg, but I only got a re-up on the visuals, no mind-fuck, no zombie tip-toe walking. If I had to guess, I would say that I only got about 25% of the strength of the first dose. I don&#039;t remember much after that except I didn&#039;t puke again, and that vaporized/smoked nbome tastes horrible. I didn&#039;t taste it the first time for some reason. After the trip ended about 4½ hours later, I was able to continue on with my life as needed and even felt like I didn&#039;t want to trip again for a while. Sleep was also unaffected, and I got a good 9 hours sleep the following night.<br /><br /><br />Well that&#039;s about it. I know I&#039;m not the best writer and I have a hard time putting ideas in any type of order. A few things I would recommend if anyone else wants to emulate this trip:<br /><br />1. Have a sitter with you. I was semi-prepared for the bitch-slap-to-the-nuts this trip gave me having tried 25i before. I could have easily dropped my vaporizer/pipe or seriously hurt myself with the lighter. Also, a sitter will remember that light switch=light and they might even clean up your puke. maybe.<br /><br />2. For the best trip experience, I would recommend listening to music while vaporizing/smoking. It will make the trip much more memorable.<br /><br />3. Install games on your computer and have them ready for yourself, because once your tripping, your not gonna be able to remember where they are or what to look for.<br /><br />4. Eat very little or not at all before the trip. I can almost guarantee you will puke at some point, and the last thing you want is pieces of digested pizza coming out of your nose.<br />
