				My number one suggestion is to add an intelligence forum where people can link to news stories regarding online drug trafficking, links to .pdf of law enforcement training manuals, shit like that. It comes in handy.<br /><br />My second suggestion is to add an advanced security subforum and only let people who are not talking out of their assholes post in it, to help cut down on all of the pure misinformation that is present in many of the security threads. <br /><br />My third suggestion is to start focusing on SR as a community and a network instead of SR as a commercial venture. Of course SR is a commercial venture and the admin should get paid, but if you want to be a customer of a website that organizes drug deals instead of part of a movement against the state and towards freedom then I really think you should have higher aspirations. This site has the potential to be so much more than a drug market place, it has the potential to get accurate security information in the hands of the people, it has the potential to be better than OVDB was in many areas IN ADDITION to being better than OVDB was at customer support etc. I think it is SR himself who needs to ask himself if he only see&#039;s SR as a commercial venture or if he wants to be part of something bigger and more powerful than that, because even though both can be done at the same time in some cases there will be conflicts of interest between what is best for the scene and what is best for the person who is running SR. I hope he can see that he is part of something bigger and make choices that aid the network, although I DO think him being paid for running the site is currently an aid to the scene because it makes the site self sustaining. <br /><br />Pretty much what I am trying to say is, let&#039;s try to bring this forum up to the quality that OVDB was. No disrespect is meant towards this community when I say this, but I think it is apparent that the information regarding security and the network organization here is of a lower quality than was the case on OVDB. But SR has the potential to be even better because it CAN raise itself to that quality standard and it already has an audience of over a hundred thousand people. Don&#039;t waste the opportunity to help secure networks from the state on lining your pockets with bitcoins....do both simultaneously.<br /><br />That ends my incoherent rambling for the day, just food for thought.

				Pipe dreams my friend. You have some huge aspirations.<br /><br />If you can point to some information online that cannot be picked to pieces by somebody else talking out their arsehole, than please point me in the right direction.<br /><br />You dont know me and I dont know you. The whole anonymity thing all leads to talking out your areshole. He says she says LOL<br />but you won&#039;t get this in an exclusive advanced security sub forum? No no.. nobody will talk out their areshole there. <br /><br />Everybody talks out their arsehole. They key is to filter the shit to suit your needs. <br />There is perceived quality within this forum that suits my needs and none of your suggestions will make me feel any different.<br /><br />I do like to read stories. I like your first suggestion. Stories are nice. I have been known to believe in stories.<br /><br />What... I am NOT part of some movement against the state and toward freedom?? <br />Um freedom from what? You are free to do as you please already.<br /><br />SR will evolve in its own time. As do all communities. Good luck pushing it into your little box of &quot;quality&quot;<br /><br />What the fuck is OVDB?<br /><br />Yes I have had a few beers.<br /><br />edit spelt there arseholes instead of THEIR arseholes.. My bad

				I agree with your third point especially. The way this place is set up (and even ovdb was this way to an extent), there is a hierarchical organizational structure when it comes to information, with SR having info on money transfers, purchase history, buyers&#039; addresses etc. Once we (hopefully/eventually) move it to a networked organizational structure, it&#039;ll be significantly hardened against human intelligence attacks. If there&#039;s a decentralized method of communication, decapitation attacks will be impossible to launch, and it will also be resilient against partial destruction (like ene getting popped). Under our current model, LE can move &quot;up&quot; the hierarchical network by following the money and/or communications, under a networked model, they would only be able to hurt &quot;nodes&quot; in limited numbers on the same level as the compromised person. Maybe I&#039;m not making any sense (few beers over here too *g*), I think the networked structure is ultimately the future of online networks like this.

I mean, to an uninformed person these things could seem to be picked apart, but professionals regarding the subject would recognize bullshit for bullshit. See, there is such a thing as objectively true information, and it can usually be verified with citations to papers. There is also such aa thing as a disinformation campaign, and it is one of law enforcements inherent strategies, they want to keep targets using as shitty of techniques as possible. There are beyond any doubt what-so-ever at least a few law enforcement accounts here who are giving on purpose bad security suggestions and advice, and spreading general disinformation etc. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You dont know me and I dont know you.

And if you say enough wrong things I can start to assume that you don&#039;t know what you are talking about. And if you say enough correct things, and prove they are correct by linking to papers or explaining your logic in an intelligent way, I will start to assume that other things you say are correct. I would like an advanced security forum for people who are consistently right, for one so that we can combat fed disinformation campaigns, for two so we can help secure everyone and for three so we can avoid people who think they know things but don&#039;t really (this sort of person is the most dangerous because even when they are corrected they rabidly defend themselves, even when evidence against them is presented). Also intelligence forum is for linking to law enforcement training materials, news stories about online drug trafficking (including busts so you can learn where others failed), etc. People on SR have a very limited perception of the scene, in reality there have been private drug forums using similar techniques for many years and there is a lot of history for new people to learn from and there have been operations against online vending operations to learn from and against participants to learn from. Also there is a true wealth of information to be learned by analysis of law enforcement training materials, case studies against cyber crime groups, etc. To not have a sub forum for the community to gather and analyze this information is just intentionally putting your community at a disadvantage. Private forums have had such sections for years now, SR kind of reminds me of a really old source forum with its layout and why are you going to let it evolve naturally when we already have found better ways ourselves? Learn where we were strong so you can be strong there also, SR has many advantages over the older forum model but don&#039;t just ignore all the good things about the private scene and OVDB learn from them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Everybody talks out their arsehole.

Let&#039;s make a sub forum for people who actually know what they are talking about also, it will really be helpful. Maybe have some rules like if you can&#039;t back up what you say with a citation then don&#039;t say it unless you can demonstrate with clear logic that you are correct. Of course there is some level of subjectivity involved with anything, but I think we can still tell apart people who are clearly talking out of their assholes from people who are expert level but prefer different strategies or techniques than other experts. Argument of this sort is good for the community, argument about if you should use encryption at all or not is a waste of fucking time and it confuses noobs. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What...

And if you are so free why do you need to use the same technology that is used by fucking Chinese dissidents to prevent yourself from being thrown into a fucking re-education center or prison if you are caught doing. You are not free, you only have the ability to resist your oppresion to the best of your abilities. My suggestion is to organize this group of people in such a way that we can more readily work as a community to further our abilities to resist our own oppression. SR has more potential than any other drug site has ever had but in many areas it is wasting its potential imo. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">SR will evolve in its own time.

My bad<br />[/quote]<br /><br />SR will evolve on its own time, but it would be wise to learn from the online drug sourcing scene that came well before it and evolved for many years before it. I don&#039;t say that SR should be like the private scene or OVDB, I just STRONGLY URGE the powers that be here to consider learning from what we did and copying us where we found strength.

				While I agree with you, that there is a niche of peer reviewed information on security, forensic science etc that can and has been very helpful here. I cant see how a bunch of wankers sitting in their ivory towers have a right to say what is good and what is not.<br /><br />If somebody has a great piece, I am sure they will post it for all. If most concur, I am sure it will be stickied, or even better, locked in an advanced security sub forum. But thats it. No media disinformation(if you were not there its most likely BS), no personal opinions and no life stories. :o<br /><br />I would dig that sub forum.<br /><br />As for the &quot;elite,&quot; &quot;those who know what they are talking about&quot;&nbsp; ONLY section, then pfffft.<br />Those in it have just segregated themselves from the community and they will be forever referred to&nbsp; as &#039;them&#039; or &#039;they&#039;...they know best because &#039;they&#039; are in the &quot;know what they are talking about section&quot; because &#039;they&#039; submitted some awesome information that &#039;they&#039; read on the internet someplace but really would not have a clue in RL.<br /><br />How many transactions have happened within SR?? bucketloads. How many busts on SR vendors and buyers? assuming that some never get mentioned I would say very few.<br /><br />I know you are trying to help this community but the community must be doing something right. <br />Sure there is a lot of shite written here. **insert innocent emoticon here** but I think you are missing the fact that the majority can decipher the shit from the good info. I know I have changed my world view a few things written on here.<br /><br />Its all just common sense with a little bit of technical know how anyway. And if you dont have common sense then nothing you or I or anybody writing a bunch of words in a advanced sub forum is going to help them. They will learn the hard way.<br /><br />And no I do believe I am part of a very big movement. I am not here for the cash. 100% goes to my suppliers apart from a few seeds here and there. I like passing on product for people to enjoy and experience what I experience. I consider SR to be a huge movement.<br /><br />So now what kmfkewm? Are you going to be like the others who have come here to change SR for the better and then get pissed off because its all just not happening fast enough and just leave. <br />Get pissed off at the dummys?<br />If I got a btc for everyone of those guys who did that I would have enough for an eightball.<br /><br />I hope you stick around and post up some objectively true information that we have been obviously missing.<br /><br />Peace
