				I assume you&#039;re talking about dried shrooms, n&#039;est pas? Well, you have to vacuum seal them (even better if you powder them first), then store them in another vacuum sealed bag, then inside a ziploc-style baggie, then in a rubbermaid type container that doesn&#039;t leak light, like wrapped in dark paper or sumpin, then in the freezer. I defy anyone to eat this material even years later and tell there&#039;s any difference in potency from freshly harvested mushies.<br /><br />Also, you could use the honey method (also dried shrooms), in this case close the honey jar well but don&#039;t freeze, It will keep for many months. Or stick the powder into veggie caps, then go to first paragraph and follow that protocol. <br /><br />And finally mix the powder into melted chocolate that has cooled somewhat but is still semiliquid. Pour into ice-cube trays, wrap well in many layers of plastic wrap or stick into ziplocs, then freeze. Stays yummy and good for who knows how long, at least a couple of years.<br /><br />goblin

You have to have the mushroom in direct contact with the honey. Honey has a preservative function, but it must touch the shroom body. Once it&#039;s mixed in, that not only keeps the shroom, but also functions as a delivery system. You eat the honey and the mushroom. So you have to know how much you&#039;re mixing in in order to give you an idea of the dose.

				Let me ammend what I just posted. You eat the honey too if the shrooms are powdered and mixed in. If they&#039;re whole or in pieces, then sure you could fish them out and even rinse them off if you don&#039;t like honey.

				Well, if it&#039;s vacuum sealed they could be OK for that time but it&#039;s always better to also freeze them and keep them out of the light.

				Light and gasses are the enemies of freshness for all organic materials. Anything you can do to limit exposure to light and gasses will improve preservation length. Vacuum sealing and storing in a container which does not allow light in should do what you are looking for. Just like bottled beer vs. keg beer. Good luck to you.
