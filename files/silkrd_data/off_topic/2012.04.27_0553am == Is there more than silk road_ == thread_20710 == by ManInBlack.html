				I stumbled across the deepnet and never got off of it! Only problem was I only found 1 interesting website. This one! I looked through the TOR directory and saw some cool stuff. But is there anything that&#039;s super fucking awesome? Like here, I can buy drugs online! That&#039;s pretty fucking awesome! Is there any other places out there that offer information or videos (NOT CP or PORN) that&#039;s unique to the TOR network? I feel that if something this awesome exists on here, there has got to be a wealth of not found information in all forms! Just seeking some guidance since surfing TOR is far from easy.<br />-MIB

				This is a search engine for TOR/deepweb sites.. very helpful to me&nbsp; &nbsp; http://hpuuigeld2cz2fd3.onion<br /><br />There is a real push of site development right now.. modeled after vendor sites like <br />http://slpxpot2peerm5d4.onion&nbsp; <br />and <br />http://426bznbgjzwd2nhp.onion<br /><br />The Farmer&#039;s Market going down was a wake up call to many (including me) that we had to start prepping right fucking now!&nbsp; I&#039;ve been flogging the Code Monkey to get <br /><br />http://shroomsrbujyplqn.onion/&nbsp; <br /><br />up and active. We should have actual content (instead of just proof-of-functionality Tor-service) by end of next weekend. Other&nbsp; people have their own backups in the works too.<br /><br />Give us a month or two and see what happens..&nbsp; There are people like me that have been wanting some shit like this for DECADES. Once DPR showed what was possible.. Oh motherfuckers it&#039;s on like donkey fucking kong!! He has first mover advantage and leads from the front.. but if he gets popped or has to fade cause of the heat.. it&#039;s just going to fall to others.<br />Shields up Spartans... WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION??<br /><br />Bank on it.

				A TOR search engine! Perfect to get started on &quot;surfing&quot; the iweb. With the few posts of some sites ion this post and the TOR search engine, I&#039;m already building a bookmark collection of interesting TOR sites. I figure I should share the TOR wiki in this thread, since I just stumbled across it and it seems like a must have. Especially for beginners. http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />-MIB
