				hi<br /><br />if you need to be discreet about your purchases (as i do) how do you store your goods?<br />once i have purchased - and its not long away (i hope) - i will need to store some cannabis (perhaps 7g) and some lsd tabs (maybe 5)<br /><br />i wont be able to consume this all immediately, so am working towards a discreet storage solution<br /><br />obviously it needs to be airtight<br /><br />anyone have any ideas? how do you store your goods?<br /><br />thanks

				From my knowledge,<br /><br />To Store -<br /><br />Cannabis: Vacuum seal, keep in darkness, keep at room temperature<br />LSD: Tin foil +/ Vacuum Seal, Keep in the fridge or somewhere cool<br /><br />

				i just store my medicine (bud) in a prescription bottle<br /><br />generally it keeps the aroma in just fine. <br /><br />not feasible to vacuum seal it all really if youre gonna be enjoying it over time<br /><br />definitely keep the lsd away from moisture (especially tap water), high temps and definitely light

I&#039;ve also heard great things about the UV 420 Jars, they&#039;re made out of UV tinted glass specifically to combat the sun&#039;s rays, the downside is that they&#039;re specifically designed for the purpose, so look more obvious. My amber prescription bottle has never let me down, and I highly recommend this method for keeping your bud in top notch condition :)

				Cannabis is legal to grow and possess in my area, so I just grow my own outside in my backyard. I don&#039;t usually think much about stealth (i.e. hiding from parents, etc) since I&#039;m an adult and can leave my shit out in the open. However, I do know a lot about long term storage. <br /><br />Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers are the best for long-term storage because they block moisture and light. Second best would be glass canning jars or mason jars. They don&#039;t block light, but they do block moisture and are fairly durable (e.g. rodents can&#039;t eat through the bags and can&#039;t be poked with a needle). <br /><br />I use jars myself mainly because their cheaper and I don&#039;t need to store my weed for 20+ years. Although thinking about it, having a few pounds stashed away in case SHTF wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea. You can always barter with weed or just smoke it when your down. You could probably even eat it if you really needed food. <br /><br />Baby food jars work great in a pinch. Just make sure the lid&#039;s rubber is still good and it&#039;s able to hold a tight seal. Then store it in a cool dark place like you would with a good bottle of wine.&nbsp; Plastic bottles work okay for short term storage, but they absorb odors and moisture so your weed won&#039;t last as long in them, but they&#039;re fine for short term storage. <br /><br />IDK about using an RX bottle. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a great option for some, but I&#039;m just thinking if I was in my son&#039;s room and I stumbled across an Rx bottle I&#039;d immediately be suspicious. Their usually transparent enough to see through and if I happened to pick it up I&#039;d know instantly it wasn&#039;t pills that was in it. <br /><br />Now if my son was smart enough to get a baby food jar and have his girlfriend paint &amp; decorate it and&nbsp; just sat it on the shelf,&nbsp; I&#039;d never think to check that. Use some pipe cleaners, googlie eyes, glue and colored sand and you got one gay looking jar that&#039;s mighty stealthy. I know they also sell those soda can stash jars. My girlfriend&#039;s dad has one and its pretty realistic. Even the weight feels right.

				umm yeah, i definitely dont have to worry about my parents going through my room...&nbsp; so an Rx bottle works perfectly. im not trying to hide shit. and i am definitely not trying to give kids advice on how to hide their drugs.<br /><br />just trying to store it until it gets used, and i only have like an eighth or two generally, no need to keep large amounts sealed up for long term in mylar bags. if people are dealing with larger quantities or are able to grow obviously its different.<br /><br /><br />and ETG - obviously the false offer is just to prove a point about doing research on these chems being offered. not actually giving free samples of a chem that causes parkinsons symptoms and death :) <br />

				I use glass to store -EVERYTHING-<br /><br />Go to your local health food store/hobby store and look for glass containers. I use little small 1 dram amber ones and larger 3 dram clear vials for crystals and powder. Use little spice jars/glass jars if I need something bigger for moonrocks, weed, or hash. I even have an amber glass salve jar that is the perfect fit for a quarter of popcorn nugs.

				I unscrewed my old playstation 1 (y) took out the circuit board put pills, speed, mdma, tabs of acid and 2C-B pills inside then put a disk ontop and hid it in my wardrobe. Parents found it they would think its an old console and leave it be although i tell me parents what i do and they are okay with it :)&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Way i see it im not lying to them and im honest about the drugs i take. Yeah my parents are pretty cool :P but yeah unscrew something and you can use it as a container where its not supposed to be then just screw it back up :)
