				Sure weed helps people be more docile. I don&#039;t think it is going to keep people blind or acting on what the government is doing. They just know it&#039;s a losing battle for them.

				I think the federal government opposes weed because, in general, it reduces people&#039;s work performance and productivity. (I know, I know, a lot of people saw they smoke some sativa and get all energized, but I doubt that&#039;s the majority. I&#039;m making generalizations.)<br /><br />Meanwhile they fast track Adderall, Ritalin and antidepressants which increase the workforce&#039;s performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />= There&#039;s my tinfoil hat rant for today. Carry on =<br />

				I think Mary Jane isn&#039;t openly accepted by the government because of what MJ could enlighten people to.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean gateway shit either. I can see the citizens who are open to MJ, be more open to other uncustomary things, not only substances but ideals and outlooks? <br /><br />Enough perspectives change, the perception changes?<br /><br /><br />This make sense? Idk. I&#039;m thread hunting.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />-IW

				Truth is there are major divides in local/semi-local/ &amp; federal as to how the direction should go.&nbsp; AND, the money is on the Feds legalizing weed within 4-6 years.&nbsp; Where the feds go, so go the rest of the country!&nbsp; Follow the money!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />All the tobacco companies will be right in trying&nbsp; to get their piece of the rainbow/pot of gold, but it will still take 6-10&nbsp; years to start getting to the point of the &quot;legalized companies even starting to come close to replicating the quality of what is currently available!&nbsp; &nbsp;DUMBASSES!!!<br /><br />NCK
