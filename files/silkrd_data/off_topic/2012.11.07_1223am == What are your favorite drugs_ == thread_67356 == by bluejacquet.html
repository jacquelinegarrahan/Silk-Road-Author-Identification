				Best &#039;drug&#039; for those types of problems would be a psychiatrist.<br /><br />Turning to drugs to rid yourself of that &#039;life sucks&#039; problem is just going to make you chase that dragon even harder and faster and you&#039;ll end up in a permanent coma 6 feet underground in no time at all.

				Thanks for the caution Quinone.&nbsp; Let me explain a&nbsp; little bit further.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tried psychiatrists, psychologists, rx drugs, shock therapy, and experimental drug trails at universities.&nbsp; Nothing has worked in 10+ years.&nbsp; So, my thought now is to have fun with recreational drugs.&nbsp; Yes, they might fuck-up my life even more, but at least FOR ONCE I&#039;ll be having some good times. I mean, isn&#039;t that why we are all on SR?&nbsp; Because drugs make you feel good, right?&nbsp; And if I happen to build up a tolerance to a point where I overdose, oh well, so be it. The ride was fun while it lasted and I certainly can&#039;t say that about living presently.<br /><br />So, anyone providing suggestions or naming of your favorites, thank you!

				In my younger years I went on a 5 year opiate binge of roughly 600mg&#039;s of oxy a day, it got me through a rough depressed time but it also created a shitload more problems for me.<br />Just know that whatever you decide to mask your depression with you&#039;re just trading that depression with addiction and that&#039;s a whole &#039;nother beast all on it&#039;s on, it only works for so long.

				I find that MDMA/MDA can be very uplifting, in both short term and long term cases just use responsibly and remember, always do some research on the drugs you plan on ingesting before you try them that way you know what to somewhat expect. Other than that take it slow and don&#039;t push your body to the limits that it&#039;s not intended to go. (:

				MDMA and it&#039;s not even a contest, although heroin might give you a &quot;forget all your troubles&quot; type of feeling as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;There&#039;s a reason why all of the MDMA &quot;flips&quot; are so popular (hippieflipping, candyflipping, etc.) - molly makes everything feel better. It&#039;s in my opinion, the most emotionally euphoric experience that you can ever have.<br /><br />&nbsp;There&#039;s already research being done on its therapeutic potential, especially in cases of PTSD, so perhaps if used correctly, it might alleviate your depression. Take it in reasonable doses and only in 2-3 increments though, or you&#039;ll be at risk for neurotoxic damage to your brain. <br /><br />But as others have pointed out, drugs are never really a great solution, only a temporary relief. I&#039;d recommend that you change the current environment that you&#039;re in. Go travel somewhere. Start exercising. And perhaps most importantly, start believing in yourself. <br /><br />Good luck, life is inherently an unfair and difficult experience, but fortunately, it can get better. Make a conscious effort to change the situation you&#039;re in before giving up on yourself.

				There is no immediate solution to your problem based on what i have heard but if u are looking for a substance to help u out i recommend MDMA.&nbsp; It is known to help people with depression and ptsd to come to terms with there problems as well as come to terms with them.&nbsp; I am not saying it will cure your problems but i have reason to believe that it will help you if taken with the right people in the right place... by that i mean with people you trust in a nice and peaceful place... That is the best advice i can give you, i hope everything turns out well...

				for sure mdma is a great drug which gives you a very euphoric high, but please read his post first - &quot;I&#039;m depressed and I want just go to la-la land and black out and even into a coma.&nbsp; What would do you like for &quot;forgetting all of your problems&quot; and that &quot;life sucks&quot; feeling&quot; i don&#039;t think mdma would be a good choice for him, it&#039;s a party-drug in my opinion with some therapeutic potential but nothing to treat long term depressions. the first times on mdma may be overwhelming and will leave you in a good mood for some days (others feel like shit next days) but with the time it will get boring and you will take larger doses to get that nice high again (what you will never really reach again, no matter how much u take)&nbsp; what also means nasty comedowns, wich will depress you even more if you don&#039;t take something for helping with the comedown.. <br /><br />if you just wanna have a nice night, mdma, lsd, 2cx, ketamine, some opiates, benzos etc. will do the trick and will let you forget your problems for a short time. thats what most drugs all about! like lesseroftwoweevils said mdma combos are just amazing.. but this wont help you with long term depressions, it will do more harm than good. talk to your doc about your problems and if it&#039;s necessary you will get a script for antidepressants..

				&nbsp;;D Really like molly, and cocaine is awesome. Mary Jane is my lesbian lover, though, forever and always. But just like the other posters said, and not trying to preach but.. drugs + wanting to die is not a healthy combo, and never has a positive outcome. If you use them properly, drugs can give you awesome experiences, good sex, cool friends.. but they can just as easily take you the opposite direction and make life miserable- really, joy-sucking, constant-empty-feeling miserable. TRUST ME!<br /><br />best of luck on your way to the clouds my friend :)

				You probably shouldn&#039;t take a very high dose of psychedelics if you are hating life.. Molly might make you love life for about 6 hours and hate it even more than you did before you took it for about a month. Weed will help you live in the moment as long as you have something else to focus on. I suggest opiates or benzos, tbh. But if you think they are going to solve your problems, not at all. Pain is actually good to feel sometimes.

				The only drug I love are amphetamines; I think everybody else has exceedingly poor taste in drugs, but that&#039;s just me, heh... I only say this maybe once every two years, but I really mean it: stay away from meth and amphetamines in general (not MDMA, I just mean meth/adderall/dexedrine/etc).&nbsp; You may not care for them and won&#039;t want to keep using, but that&#039;s pretty rare.&nbsp; I know I sound all fatherly and shit, but I&#039;m serious.&nbsp; If they click with you, you will not be depressed *at all* on meth for at least a week or two after you start using it, but you&#039;ll probably never ever let go of it.&nbsp; If you&#039;re willing to dive head-first into that pit... I don&#039;t see how anyone could be truly depressed when they first start taking amphetamines.&nbsp; That goes away pretty quickly though and you end up using them for all the other great things you get, but you don&#039;t get that perfect contentment ever again really.&nbsp; I think you should still have the choice of being a junkie if you want to though, so there ya go.<br /><br />You actually sound as though you may want to abuse so heavily you end up dead, which is about as damaging as it&#039;s gonna get.&nbsp; If that&#039;s how you&#039;re feeling... you shouldn&#039;t be doing any drugs unless you&#039;re prepared for them a) to not end up killing you, and b) just fucking things up even more when the money&#039;s gone.<br /><br />An old friend of mine used to say he thought PCP was the best antidepressant there is. I never saw his point, but it was sure as Hell fun and I don&#039;t hear about many people losing their lives over PCP.&nbsp; shrug.&nbsp; It can cause permanent schizophrenia with chronic use though, I&#039;ve read.

				Alright here&#039;s my 2 cents <br /><br />Don&#039;t get fucked up because you are depressed. While you&#039;ll have a great night, when you&#039;ll wake up the next morning you&#039;ll feel even shittier than before. I know this not by personal experience but because one of my best friend has gone through that kind of hell train. He used to get very drunk or fucked up on GHB or speed pills and whatnot. But since you actually made that thread I guess you&#039;re pretty decided that you want to try something new so let me give you my honest opinion on your OP. <br /><br />MDMA<br /><br />Don&#039;t even consider any other drugs. MDMA&nbsp; is the best feel good drug for me, and once again, this is an opinion. Actually, MDMA can help you out of your depression, because if you do your own research, you&#039;ll find it was used by psychologists and psychiatrists when it was still legal. Don&#039;t get me wrong, what I said above is still true: you&#039;ll feel like useless shit the next morning if you are depressed. <br /><br />But here&#039;s the goodie with MDMA, it can really change your life and give you profound insights on you personal life as well as your relationship with people. Just a quick example, I had a really major conflict with a girl, things weren&#039;t working at all and it became a love-hate relationship. We rolled together and ever since things aren&#039;t the same we get along very well. Same thing happened with the friend I mentioned above: it did help him out of his drug addiction. When he rolled, he had the best time ever but he realized he was out of control. Two weeks later he stopped drugs completely and didn&#039;t even need the help of a rehab center or anything.<br /><br />But MDMA is no magic. What it does is that it suppresses some filters your EGO puts in your brain. Emotional, social and logical filters. There is no better drug to be honest with yourself. <br /><br />So actually, if you&nbsp; really intend on getting fucked up, here&#039;s what you should do. Find good quality crystals on SilkRoad, not the pills. Take about 150mg which is a nice dosage (opinion...opinion :D ), and USE that roll to get introvertive. Just learn about yourself, and be honest for once. I say for once, because you&#039;ll be amazed at how honest you&#039;ll be with your own feelings. <br /><br />I wished this drug would still be legal, but it does fuck you up for real. You&#039;ll feel like shit the next morning, but maybe you&#039;ll have some things figured out on yourself that you were clueless about. <br /><br />Please keep posting here I&#039;m interested in knowing how you&#039;ll do, whatever drug you choose.

				hey man, look i to have struggled with manic deression, anxiety and social problmes since the day i came of age many moons ago,lol. now i dont mean any disrespect to any of the other members that have gave their 2cents , but i skimmed thru some and imho it all seems to be terrible advice. now you say LSd and Ket and marijuana have not quite done the trick for you, from what ive found in my years of self medicating those three seem to be the sinlge most effective way of making me feel beter about lifein general, now givin it will only be for small perdiods of time in campairison to the time we all live lol, not so much LSD because ive found that having it around seems to keep me on the up and up giving me a beautiful thing to look fooward at the end of the long and miserable work week, but all the the other options as far as substances go , such as benzos, any kind of amphetamines or uppers, mda, mdma , straight E pills.. any of it.. it may all be a wonderful lala land whilst your on them, but the come downs and withdrawls they give you by no means make them in any way effective in cases with people like you and i, and many others who use substances to hinder their life issues. esp the opiates, they make shit ok no matter what may be your problem, but like one memebr said the problems issues and drama they subsiquently bring into your life far outweigh the good feeling you may have whilst high on them. so formost stay the fuck away from the opiates and esp the uppers. id have to say what really makes my life a shit load better over all is the LSD of coarse, not too often though cause it will lose its magic if you do it more often than one or twice a month, constant marijuana smoking when permited(such as not having to be sober for anything of importance), and the ket is just great to feel good in small blasts.. but the most important part of useing substances to increase your quality of life is aboslolutely who and what you surround your self with. laughter man its thee cure to any shit show life constantly throws in your face. you have to be able to keep good freinds around you that are as much alike you as possible and just have some good laughs. now i suppose not everry one is like me and can just drop a hit or three with a buddy lay on the beach all night looking up at the amaziing planted and world we live in and just having some laughs, usualy about nothing lol. if that dont seem possible for you try watching or listning to some comedians, the jerky boys, russel peters etc..<br />i also suggest taking the three ive emtioned and useing them together, now i dont know the extent of your drug expeerience , but start light and ease along. i find that a few nice sized bumps of KET just as you drop some L makes for an incredible come up, then copius amounts of weed all thru out the trip. scenery is quite important as well, always try to be outdoors when possible if weather permits, tho you dont want to be anywere out with strange ppl around, for any one that is not with you is against you while on these drugs lol. it just seems to make the trip much heavier and more paranoid. i feel i can go for days on this, but the point im trying to relay here is that with those three substances and the right company no amount of stress or depression can ever get to you. then just try to take what youve felt learned discovered and experienced while on your trip, and take it with you for the next how ever long untill the next journey. life sucks, but if you know where and how to look at it, you can find the humor in all of it.; and again, laughter is the cure to all that hinders you. i sincerly hope at least somthing ive jabberd about can be of any help to you. i wish you the best! happy , well happy happiness hunting!

				ive heard good things about MXE, Though i urge you to some time in the near future drop 2 hits of good L in a warm, safe &amp; comfortable setting, some awesome music, good trusting company..and my friend, you will free your mind=0)<br /><br />&nbsp;Edit: i said two hits , but it could be more, the point im trying to relay here is KILL YOUR EGO, strangle the last breath out of it, and you will be a better man for having seen the wonder we all live in and take for granted each day, all life, physics, the universe and simply the way it all works. best wishes friend.
