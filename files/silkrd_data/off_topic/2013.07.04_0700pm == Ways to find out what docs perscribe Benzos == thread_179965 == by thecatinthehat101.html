				I know your gonna say word of mouth but is there any other way to find out who perscribes Benzo&#039;s for anxiety disorder. I know what you guys are thinkin but I have legitimate reasons why the drug is needed??<br /><br />I think its stupid that some doc&#039;s will not prescribe them. Especially for someone who is afraid to leave their house and has house bound syndrome. Yes that&#039;s me and I&#039;m sick of being a prisoner!

				Getting benzos prescribed isn&#039;t that hard, some doctors are a pain in the ass but you just have to keep trying... Go to the doctor, tell him you have anxiety and explain your symptoms (it has to look severe and you blood pressure should be elevated, indicating anxiety, because he will check that).. You have to look stressed basically. Then he&#039;s gonna prescribe something that&#039;s probably gonna suck, you can try your luck by saying you&#039;ve already had that and it didn&#039;t work (only if he has no way of knowing you past medical history) or just don&#039;t say anything and act like you don&#039;t know anything about meds..<br /><br />If he prescribed you shit, come back one to two weeks later saying your symptoms didn&#039;t improve and you&#039;re just getting side effects, repeat until he gives you good shit.. If after a month you don&#039;t have good shit, go to another doctor.<br /><br />It works better with insomnia though, because you can just come back 5 days later saying you still can&#039;t sleep at all and he won&#039;t put you on SSRIs saying you need to give it 2 weeks to act of some bullshit... With insomnia, you usually get benzos within 2 weeks max if you come back every 5 days or so. To not get ambien, say you have trouble falling asleep AND you wake up during the night or wake up super early.. Say you sleep 3 hours on good nights. <br /><br />Claiming insomnia is a better way to get benzos prescribed... They usually give SSRIs for anxiety and you have to wait ages before claiming it doesn&#039;t work, and then sometimes they want to change the SSRI you&#039;re on (if he wants to give you another SSRI just see another doctor :P)

Most doctors will not prescribe Benzodiazapines for this condition, as they are often pushed by reps to push these SSRIs; and muscled by the DEA to prescribe less Benzodiazapines and Opiates. Opiates, like Benzos, can be used as an alternative anti-depressant / anti-anxiety, but typically not in America.<br /><br />As long as you are an adult, and you express a complete distrust/lack of desire in Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, this should not be a very hard feat to be prescribed Benzos. <br /><br />I will note that long-term use of Benzos, will lead to dependency... you will not be able to leave your home without them, after a while. I strongly recommend over-coming your own fears, by forcing yourself to function right along the rest of society. If you need people to help you, I&#039;m sure your friends and family would be more than happy to step up to the plate, and help you force yourself to be social.

This will make the doctor think twice about prescribing a liability to a liability. And will likely then be like, &quot;What do you know of Benzodiazapines; Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Klonapin?&quot; ...&nbsp; <br /><br />The object here, is not to express an &#039;interest&#039; in Benzos.... but rather, a disinterest in SSRIs. :)

				If you legitimately need benzos to function just be upfront with the Doc. Don&#039;t act shady and nervous just tell them straightforward what your problems are and the ineffectiveness SSRI&#039;s have had for you.
