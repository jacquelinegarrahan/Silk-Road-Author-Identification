				Hello, I have been in contact with the UK seller No Sticks No Seeds who largely seems to have a very good rep in the community but he suggests on his profile that for larger amounts contact him. I did so and was told that I could get great strains from him with bank transfer payments.<br /><br />Obviously my conundrum is that a transaction outside of SR has no safety net and wondered if anyone else had done this before as he seems a trustworthy guy?

				step 1) we make a black market that keeps both sellers and buyers safe from the police.<br />step 2) we pay with digital encrypted currency so the money can&#039;t be tracked back to us.<br />step 3) we create escrow so we can be even safer than before when making a deal.<br />step 4) we make deals outside escrow to save 10-15 dollars.<br />step 5) we are idiots and go to jail because we are too ignorant and we think we are smarter than the system.<br /><br />FUCK LOGIC!

Making mistakes on this site could have life changing consequences for yourself and loved ones. IMO, there is no such thing as a &quot;trustworthy guy&quot; when your conducting business on an anonymous market place (selling illegal products), located on the Hidden Web where members use fake names and pay for their goods with an anonymous currency. :o

				If a seller is suggesting you do business with him outside of SR or asking fro FE before he is allowed to, report him to SR Support, move on and likely save yourself some $$.

				As you yourself observed, &quot;there is no safety net.&quot; Keep it in escrow son; there&#039;s too much can go wrong.

If you instruct your buyers to pay you in any other way, or to contact you off-site, your seller privileges WILL be revoked. You may provide back up contact methods in case of site failure. &#039; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If he is asking you to trade off site via bank transfer it&#039;s clearly against the rules, report him to &#039;SR Support&#039;, he is an established vendor who should know better!
