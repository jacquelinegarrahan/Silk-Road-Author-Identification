				Try being more like you would like people to see you than what you are by the looks of it.. ie. your only option is to be totally fake, re invent yourself, dye your mustash black and get a wig, bowler hat, cane and suit. Call everyone chum and old boy and learn to whistle and play croquet.. Instead of asking people for money tell them your a billionaire with a heart problem, that should get you a girlfriend pretty sharpish..

				Dude I understand what you are going thru. You have got to like yourself and enjoy your own company. Who else is gonna like you if you don&#039;t like yourself? Believe in yourself and be a stand up person who has convictions in his beliefs. Don&#039;t even worry about aiming your sites on one particular lady. That never works good and you end up being her slave. Just love yourself man and let your light shine and there will be ladies that are right for you to come into view for you. Remember that ladies are just people also and they get just as nervous about trying to meet new guys. What&#039;s really important is the mental connections you can make with a lady.&nbsp; The best advice I can give you if you got one lady you are after is to make a mental connection with her by talking to her like she&#039;s a person and not even acting like you want to date her. Try being friends first then you will find out honestly if she&#039;s the type of lady you would want to take the next step with.

				Ok first about me I have only a handful of friends but that is how I like it the ones I have are like family. Second read Dale Carnegie &quot;How To Win Friends And Influence people it is a great book and it works. Third about confidence 100% chicks dig confidence go to the hottest most popular girl you know the one who doesn&#039;t know you exist go up to her and say something that is both complementary and insulting, like &quot;nice shoes, too bad they don&#039;t match your purse&#039; but nothing that stupid. She will not know what to think. Dude you have internet read up on this shit knowledge is power . Look at the guys that are ass deep in pussy they are all assholes stop sucking up and being too nice but please do not be an asshole. You remind me in a way of an old Army buddy I had this guy was GOOFY but he was cool he relished in his goofiness. He had a hell of a time with the women and this dud was a musician and a good one too. I used to joke that Dean she will not know what to think could not get laid in a Mexican whore house with hundred dollar bills hanging out of his pocket. Any way he shot his last bag at the age of 24 sad too young to die. What I am saying man is be you but confident and if the bitches don&#039;t dig you they aint for you no how.

				Focus on you&#039;re career and how to get where you want to be. Go wherever that may take you and be a good person. Dedicate yourself and do your best.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry about women or being liked. It&#039;ll all fall into place before you know it in the meantime, and.effortlessly.

				rophnyol and spermicide...nah Im playing dont do that you could go to prison.Forced sex is bad mmmk? <br /><br />1.Don&#039;t be a fat ass.No one likes a fat ass.Eat healthy and work out/exercise.<br /><br />2.Eat pineapples or drink pineapples juice it makes your cum taste sweet (or so my fiancee says but I think she just loves my cum) and its good for you its a win win.<br /><br />3.Don&#039;t be that quiet creepy kid in the corner that people aren&#039;t sure if you will mass murder the school if they attempt to talk to you (yes some people are legitimately scared of quiet people) which is somewhat reasonable considering the amount of murderers/serial killers that had different types of anti social personality disorders.<br /><br />4.Don&#039;t act like yourself people are being ignorant you said and I quote &quot;How to get people to like me?&quot; so obviously the whole being yourself thing isn&#039;t working out that well.And it didn&#039;t work out for me either.Its kinda like when a super rich &quot;charismatic&quot; person is loved by everyone and everyone thinks hes a good guy and he puts his best face and pretends but then goes home and slaps the fuck out of his family.Or a model who gets in nothing but her panties and bra and makes slutty poses and smiles and acts confident and happy but then goes to the bathroom after the session and throws up and is disgusted by her body.Its definitely not in the best interest of some people to &quot;be yourself&quot;.A good example of a real situation would be Owen Wilson the actor that played in all types of kids movies and was always smiling and shit but then attempted to kill himself.He obviously wasn&#039;t happy since he tried to kill himself,yet he made millions and was all over televisions and theater screens nationwide with a big ol&#039; shit grin on his face.So it might be a good idea to not be yourself in front of other people.Because maybe you are like me and people dont like the real me.I&#039;m sure many people wouldn&#039;t like me anymore if I didn&#039;t pretend and act in real life because people are different than me and I sometimes have to adapt to a situation.<br /><br />5.marijuana and alcohol especially are good for creating fabricated confidence if you really cant be confident.<br /><br />6.An easy thing to remember when you&#039;re in a social situation is that the person you are trying to communicate with is nothing.They are not any better than you and that no matter what position they have or what authority they have they are piles of shit and cum stains and mere blemishes on the earth as we all are.<br /><br />7.Talk shit in real life because it really does help.It seems kind of dickish but it works for everyone that does it including myself.Just be an arrogant little prick about everything! Sports,work,games,drugs,sex,everything.Just act as if you&#039;re better than everyone at everything even if you suck at what you&#039;re talking about and play it off if someone challenges you and you think youll lose.Or go all try hard and actually exert enough energy to beat the competition.<br /><br />8.LIE.lie lie lie lie lie.Period.Everyone lies.Lies help us get an advantage in a situation.If someone tells you that lying will always catch up with you or any of that bullshit they&#039;re just saying that because they dont like being lied to or its them tricking you into telling the truth.But if at all possible dont lie to your partner and try to avoid lying to family.Unless its in the best interest of them.For example if it would crush your mothers heart if she found out you do heroin and she asks if you&#039;re high just lie &quot;no I just feel pretty lethargic and beat down from not getting any sleep last night.&quot; If your girlfriend tells you that your eyes look red and glassy be like &quot;yeah its these god damn allergies I swear they get me every year&quot; then quickly make it look more believable by making her go to the store to get some zyrtec.Lies are a great tool in social situations especially ones on vacation or at parties because you know the girl you&#039;re lying to is just gunna be a hit it and quit it anyway never to be seen or heard from again.<br /><br />9.Don&#039;t be a scrub.Take showers.Put on cologne.Deodorant.Clean matching clothes.All that shit.<br /><br />10.Don&#039;t be a pussy.Rejection occasionally is just part of the game.Don&#039;t take criticism to heart.I always find it helpful when someone criticizes me if I just look them up and down scope them out and then realize that they are no better if not worse than I am.Ugly,fat,bitch tits,obnoxious,loud,low IQ.It always helps to realize that another human can and will point out your flaws all through life but then again they have flaws too.And you could even talk shit back if you want depending on if the situation is appropriate for shit talking (a little nobody,a cop if you did nothing illegal,a teacher,a coed,pretty much any little cock sucker who means nothing) like if you&#039;re girls ex says something to you just say &quot; yeah well you got a small dick your ex told me&quot; hahah that kills guys inside and it really does take a critical hit on their self esteem.If its really necessary to argue or talk back women are easily offended by calling them fat,ugly,hoes,whores(especially if they really are!),cunts,worthless,ect... and this will probably end the argument pretty quickly,some things that always get to a guy are telling them they have a small dick,telling them they are weak or not powerful or strong,telling them that they are homosexual/gay/faggots/queers/turd burglers/cum guzzlers/cock suckers.<br /><br />11.Cant stress enough about being all cleaned up,teeth brushed,hair combed,shaved,dressed proper,ect... Kinda considered &quot;metrosexual&quot; but I go so far as to wear spring/summer/fall/winter clothes and colognes that go along with the season or weather,then of course different colognes and clothes for night time and day time.Also dont over dress because that&#039;s also pretty gay and people will think you&#039;re weird as fuck and/or psychopathic if you show up to a frat party with a cannibal corpse shirt,some black goth pants,and a creepy ass spiked choker.Also dont show up to a formal or semi formal gathering wearing some baggy ass PRPS jeans,fitted cap,ghetto ass shirt,with your fancy little Swiss watch and your neck all blinged out.And the only other thing I can think of other than that is if you have tattoos if you&#039;re in a professional environment keep them covered I have lots of problems with this.Women like men who are dressed nice,its no different for women.What would you prefer? A hard body bitch dressed nice smelling nice with a clean and shaved pussy? Or would you prefer the fat bitch with the matted hair smelling like piss with a hairy and fishy scented snatch? Exactly haha you dont want to hook up with nasty bitches,girls dont wanna fuck nasty guys its simple.<br /><br />12.Some things are better kept to yourself especially if you&#039;re around close minded,crazy ass conservative people whos brains are stuck in the 1800&#039;s.Things that should be kept to yourself at all times around these people are politics ESPECIALLY gay marriage,abortions,presidential candidates,ect... because this can make or break deals,conversations,it can be a total buzz kill if you&#039;re high,and no one wants to get pissed over such stupid things.Don&#039;t talk about sex around these people,dont talk about drugs,dont talk about religion,masturbation,what you do in your past time such as watching porn,killing animals,playing with fire,watching snuff films,ect...<br /><br />13.Conversation is easy if you&#039;re attentive.I love playing the conversation game its simple you look at your surroundings,take mental notes on what you see ex. music cds,games,books,companies,television shows,pretty much anything that the person likes.Then let the bullshit fly..You see a Slayer CD so you say dude do you know the band slayer? &quot;Oh my god dude I love slayer! I have like 5 of there cds&quot; then youre just respond exitedly &quot;dude no way! Lets listen to some slayer!&quot; then they&#039;re in a good mood because they&#039;re listening to music they like and they already feel you because you have something in common.Bullshit some more &quot;I think my dad knows how to play this on guitar&quot; blah blah blah.Then do it all over again just be attentive to how they react to certain subjects,take mental notes on things that the person has said they like or things that are laying around there house chances are if they have like 50 xbox games they probably like playing xbox so with this tiny observation you can think of a popular game that you have played that everyone else has played like halo,or Modern Warfare 3,or black ops and then start a conversation.Once again they will be drawn to you because they think you have so much in common.This is a GREAT trick to use on girls.<br /><br />14.Girls are the easiest to talk to because they&#039;re so god damn naive and easy to manipulate lmao.All you have to do is start a conversation give a compliment or two,abruptly end the conversation leaving them baffled and wanting more,come back later and get the number but this time bullshit and give compliments real compliments like &quot;damn you have gorgeous eyes,Ive never seen another person with eyes like yours&quot; This is a good compliment because it makes them feel unique and special.Act like you dont wanna fuck.A bad compliment would be like &quot;Damn you have gorgeous eyes,I wish I could pop them out and keep them in a glass jar.&quot; and unless the girl is being painfully obvious about being down to fuck then just dont say anything straight forward like &quot;Hey sexy can I toss your salad in the bathroom?&quot; its smarter to move things to a different more quiet location after the compliments ask if she wants to go back to your place,if you&#039;re at school ask her if you can walk her to her locker,if all signs were good it is possible to fuck and its definitely possible if not probable that you will get a kiss.But for the love of god get close to her face and look at her and if she pulls back,takes a step back,turns her head,or just looks stressed or unsure about it then you need to step back and play it off.If you read these signals wrong and you go in for the kiss or the ol&#039; ass grab or maybe a nipple rub then you are fucked lmao and everything you just said and everything you just went through failed and is pointless and you have to start all the way over with a different girl at a different place and you just wasted an hour of your life.Humans are easy to read in person its honestly not that hard but Ive seen people fuck up the ending right before the final objective (getting it in,making out and then getting it in) is executed.And it seems like people are usually pretty humiliated and disappointed even though its a fail so great that you have to laugh at the amateur that was so close but couldn&#039;t quite seal the deal...But its life I suppose.<br /><br />15.Its always easy to bullshit old folks too.Because people do small talk they dont do long in depth conversations.So all you have to do is look up some bullshit gay ass propaganda spreading media source like faux news.Oops I meant fox.And then read a few articles and then use this as a tool.<br /><br />16.Its super fun to conversate when you&#039;re stoned.It doesn&#039;t matter if Im sober or high though I always look at socializing as a game of sorts.Its pleasing and somewhat humorous to know that you fooled another person intellectually.The guys think that you are awesome and the girls want to give your dick a massage all because you used your wits and cleverness to be in complete control of the conversation and to bullshit your way into the hearts of many.<br /><br />17.All humans are looking for the same thing when they socialize.If you are talking to a guy they want gratification for something they did &quot;props dude that was a pretty sick swoosh!&quot;,attention a.k.a. pretend like you a give a fuck about the shit that is spewing from his mouth,answers,trust,consolations,bullshit compliments about bravery/courage,and in general nothing important.These things dont always apply to friends and they dont always apply online only on facebook,twitter,ect... where you are dealing with people you might know and sites that a potential employer can look.<br /><br />18.What girls want from the conversation are compliments about anything to do with their appearance like hair,teeth,physique,ass,tits,whatever,they love compliments about personality (especially if you have been talking to the girl for an extended period.First compliments on appearance,then compliments on personality) if the girl is in love with you be sure to completely detach the appearance from the personality girls hate to be only thought of because of the appearance which is ironic because they&#039;re so worried about there appearance all the time.But a good example would be &quot;You are so sexy, I love you&#039;re body,and I wouldn&#039;t trade it for anything because it belongs to the girl I love&quot; see what I did? You compliment the body but make sure that you separate the human girl with emotions and a brain and thoughts from the body of the human girl.Because it is a turn off for girls in farther stages of relationships if the only thing that they are worth to you is there body.They want you to love emotionally and connect mentally and to see them for them as in personality and thoughts and opinions,but also the body,its very tricky to get this part down pat.Things they also want from conversations is gratification/thanks/rewards,thoughtful responses,putting them up while putting other girls down,building there confidence/self esteem,consoling,letting them know that you are there/wont abandon them,letting them vent/talk about issues,and anything that makes them feel special and or unique or above the general population.Be careful though make sure they know you dont take shit or when you put them on this pedestal they will be delusional and think they are in charge of you and/or that you are able to be pussy whipped which can only end in heartbreak/break up,domestic violence,or misery and being whipped like a little bitch boy.<br /><br />19.Its always easier to go into a social situation with a wingman.A wingman is a close friend who has no intentions on getting this girl but instead goes into the situation with you to talk you up and make you seem like more of a bad ass than james bonde.He can fabricate stories of how much ass you kick on a daily basis (or it could be true depending on who you are) or he could talk about how much he envies you.Its the ultimate friend coming into a situation for the sole purpose of making you look good in comparison to him and all other guys.The wingman will put himself down and put you up.He will talk about only the things that you are good about without being to obvious.The wingman doesn&#039;t do this just because though lol usually youll have to be his wingman the next night or he can save it and use you as a wingman when he sees a girl he really wants to fuck.<br /><br />20.There is a difference between being smart,clever,and charismatic and being a fake,asshole,and complete dick.There are several perfect examples for this.One example would be lames who think they&#039;re hard ass mixed martial arts kung fu gods because they wear tapout shirts and play UFC on xbox live and beat someone these are the people that you can make fun of our talk shit to because they act like hard asses and naive people think they&#039;re hard when in reality they are weak and pussies and would never actually fight someone.So when you talk shit to them you automatically create an impression that you are even more fearless and hard then &quot;MMA hard ass ufc jujitsu karate bros&quot; another example would be talking shit to pathetic little guys who think they know about guns and honestly think they could survive in a warzone because they play black ops.When in reality they have no idea what the difference between a 9mm,a .50 AE shot from a desert eagle and a .50 shot from a M82,.45,or think that an AK shoots .223 bullets.So how the fuck can they think they will survive a warzone or know how a weapon kicks or how to load or drop a clip? They dont they just like to talk shit and people like this are fun to call out and talk shit to because they ask for it and it proves your intellectual superiority over the person.<br /><br />21.Don&#039;t trust anyone.If you dont trust anyone you can never be let down in any situation including a social situation.And dont care about what other people say.<br /><br />This was long and drawn out I just spent about 20 minutes typing this shit.And I know Ill end up getting negative karma for it but oh well.If you are seriously trolling and not looking for legitimate advice then I hope you burn in hell you dirty bastard.If you were serious and not trolling then I hope all that shit I just typed helps you out.And remember humans are filthy greedy selfish little creatures and usually they just want attention they think they deserve,money,or sex.Tell them what they want to hear,bullshit,and lie and you will flourish in our fucked up world.Be a nice guy and never get the girl,sex,money,or any other pleasures this isnt a movie acted out in hollywood this is real life and shits fucked up so you have to be even more fucked up to win we live in a world that celebrates and praises the fucked up aspects of life like TV jersey shore consists of orange guidos fucking everything that walks they get money to do this and are famous for the,sex in the city doesnt even need an explanation,pornstars like jenna jameson are more well known and heard of than nobel peace prize winner.In our music we glorify death in our death metal,black metal,and hip hop we glorify robberies in music,we glorify rape and sodomy in music like tyler,the creator we glorify all types of shit in our music like whores and bitches getting famous for being whores and bitches like paris hilton,kim kardashian,snooki,ect... In our world we glorify authority figures and police when they kill our youth and beat our elderly and the news for christs sake! They are mainstream news chanels and even they only talk about death,murder corruption,animal abuse,rapes,child molestation,thefts,and they lie and lie and lie and lie and brainwash.In a world like this what makes you think you will get anywhere being good? The president lies,the pope lies and covers up child molestations,the teachers and coaches molest children,the actresses are sluts and encourage the youth to be sluts,the musicians do the same,all of these fucked up people didnt get famous and then become fucked up they got famous because they&#039;re fucked up I bet in my country we know more about death,sex,corruption,and lies more than we know of our own history.You have to be a cold person to get anywhere you have to be ready to be deceived when it happens you have to take part in it to win,.Its survival of the fittest and the majority of humans are naive,trusting,gullible,easy to read,and even more easy to manipulate.So if you really want something just go get it all of it is much easier than you think.If the person is not a friend and if you have no feelings for the person the person can easily be used as a tool for your own desires.People do it everyday.Politicians do it all day every day.No person is innocent and no person is better than another so its not that big of a deal to me and if the person is not a trustworthy person they will fuck you over just the same.

				Widen your social circle.&nbsp; Take a night class, or a hobby or sport, something sociable.&nbsp; The more people you know, the more likely it is that you&#039;ll find like minded others and like minded women.&nbsp;

				Thats true noir.&nbsp; I joined a martial arts class and was actually quite amazed how social they were.<br />Being a purpose built dojo and most of the guys obviously seemed to know each other for a long time, after about a month or so i was getting invited to BBQ&#039;s, the pub and what not.&nbsp; Not that i ever went of course, i personally enjoy my personal time but mixing in some kind of class definitely works.

				Glad you agree Adasel&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Also, mixing with people is good for keeping you socialized, so when you do meet someone you like, you&#039;re already used to talking people and it&#039;s one less thing to worry about.&nbsp; And, Outoftime20, if you&#039;re struggling to have your current social circle accept your changes mixing with new people is good to get feedback on yourself, it could boost your confidence if people aren&#039;t immediately down on you.<br /><br />One of the best things I ever did was changing school, from one place where I was a bit weird, to another where suddenly I might have been a bit weird but that was okay/interesting.

Kinda considered &quot;metrosexual&quot; but I go so far as to wear spring/summer/fall/winter clothes and colognes that go along with the season or weather,then of course different colognes and clothes for night time and day time.Also dont over dress because that&#039;s also pretty gay and people will think you&#039;re weird as fuck and/or psychopathic if you show up to a frat party with a cannibal corpse shirt,some black goth pants,and a creepy ass spiked choker.Also dont show up to a formal or semi formal gathering wearing some baggy ass PRPS jeans,fitted cap,ghetto ass shirt,with your fancy little Swiss watch and your neck all blinged out.And the only other thing I can think of other than that is if you have tattoos if you&#039;re in a professional environment keep them covered I have lots of problems with this.Women like men who are dressed nice,its no different for women.What would you prefer? A hard body bitch dressed nice smelling nice with a clean and shaved pussy? Or would you prefer the fat bitch with the matted hair smelling like piss with a hairy and fishy scented snatch? Exactly haha you dont want to hook up with nasty bitches,girls dont wanna fuck nasty guys its simple.<br /><br />12.Some things are better kept to yourself especially if you&#039;re around close minded,crazy ass conservative people whos brains are stuck in the 1800&#039;s.Things that should be kept to yourself at all times around these people are politics ESPECIALLY gay marriage,abortions,presidential candidates,ect... because this can make or break deals,conversations,it can be a total buzz kill if you&#039;re high,and no one wants to get pissed over such stupid things.Don&#039;t talk about sex around these people,dont talk about drugs,dont talk about religion,masturbation,what you do in your past time such as watching porn,killing animals,playing with fire,watching snuff films,ect...<br /><br />13.Conversation is easy if you&#039;re attentive.I love playing the conversation game its simple you look at your surroundings,take mental notes on what you see ex. music cds,games,books,companies,television shows,pretty much anything that the person likes.Then let the bullshit fly..You see a Slayer CD so you say dude do you know the band slayer? &quot;Oh my god dude I love slayer! I have like 5 of there cds&quot; then youre just respond exitedly &quot;dude no way! Lets listen to some slayer!&quot; then they&#039;re in a good mood because they&#039;re listening to music they like and they already feel you because you have something in common.Bullshit some more &quot;I think my dad knows how to play this on guitar&quot; blah blah blah.Then do it all over again just be attentive to how they react to certain subjects,take mental notes on things that the person has said they like or things that are laying around there house chances are if they have like 50 xbox games they probably like playing xbox so with this tiny observation you can think of a popular game that you have played that everyone else has played like halo,or Modern Warfare 3,or black ops and then start a conversation.Once again they will be drawn to you because they think you have so much in common.This is a GREAT trick to use on girls.<br /><br />14.Girls are the easiest to talk to because they&#039;re so god damn naive and easy to manipulate lmao.All you have to do is start a conversation give a compliment or two,abruptly end the conversation leaving them baffled and wanting more,come back later and get the number but this time bullshit and give compliments real compliments like &quot;damn you have gorgeous eyes,Ive never seen another person with eyes like yours&quot; This is a good compliment because it makes them feel unique and special.Act like you dont wanna fuck.A bad compliment would be like &quot;Damn you have gorgeous eyes,I wish I could pop them out and keep them in a glass jar.&quot; and unless the girl is being painfully obvious about being down to fuck then just dont say anything straight forward like &quot;Hey sexy can I toss your salad in the bathroom?&quot; its smarter to move things to a different more quiet location after the compliments ask if she wants to go back to your place,if you&#039;re at school ask her if you can walk her to her locker,if all signs were good it is possible to fuck and its definitely possible if not probable that you will get a kiss.But for the love of god get close to her face and look at her and if she pulls back,takes a step back,turns her head,or just looks stressed or unsure about it then you need to step back and play it off.If you read these signals wrong and you go in for the kiss or the ol&#039; ass grab or maybe a nipple rub then you are fucked lmao and everything you just said and everything you just went through failed and is pointless and you have to start all the way over with a different girl at a different place and you just wasted an hour of your life.Humans are easy to read in person its honestly not that hard but Ive seen people fuck up the ending right before the final objective (getting it in,making out and then getting it in) is executed.And it seems like people are usually pretty humiliated and disappointed even though its a fail so great that you have to laugh at the amateur that was so close but couldn&#039;t quite seal the deal...But its life I suppose.<br /><br />15.Its always easy to bullshit old folks too.Because people do small talk they dont do long in depth conversations.So all you have to do is look up some bullshit gay ass propaganda spreading media source like faux news.Oops I meant fox.And then read a few articles and then use this as a tool.<br /><br />16.Its super fun to conversate when you&#039;re stoned.It doesn&#039;t matter if Im sober or high though I always look at socializing as a game of sorts.Its pleasing and somewhat humorous to know that you fooled another person intellectually.The guys think that you are awesome and the girls want to give your dick a massage all because you used your wits and cleverness to be in complete control of the conversation and to bullshit your way into the hearts of many.<br /><br />17.All humans are looking for the same thing when they socialize.If you are talking to a guy they want gratification for something they did &quot;props dude that was a pretty sick swoosh!&quot;,attention a.k.a. pretend like you a give a fuck about the shit that is spewing from his mouth,answers,trust,consolations,bullshit compliments about bravery/courage,and in general nothing important.These things dont always apply to friends and they dont always apply online only on facebook,twitter,ect... where you are dealing with people you might know and sites that a potential employer can look.<br /><br />18.What girls want from the conversation are compliments about anything to do with their appearance like hair,teeth,physique,ass,tits,whatever,they love compliments about personality (especially if you have been talking to the girl for an extended period.First compliments on appearance,then compliments on personality) if the girl is in love with you be sure to completely detach the appearance from the personality girls hate to be only thought of because of the appearance which is ironic because they&#039;re so worried about there appearance all the time.But a good example would be &quot;You are so sexy, I love you&#039;re body,and I wouldn&#039;t trade it for anything because it belongs to the girl I love&quot; see what I did? You compliment the body but make sure that you separate the human girl with emotions and a brain and thoughts from the body of the human girl.Because it is a turn off for girls in farther stages of relationships if the only thing that they are worth to you is there body.They want you to love emotionally and connect mentally and to see them for them as in personality and thoughts and opinions,but also the body,its very tricky to get this part down pat.Things they also want from conversations is gratification/thanks/rewards,thoughtful responses,putting them up while putting other girls down,building there confidence/self esteem,consoling,letting them know that you are there/wont abandon them,letting them vent/talk about issues,and anything that makes them feel special and or unique or above the general population.Be careful though make sure they know you dont take shit or when you put them on this pedestal they will be delusional and think they are in charge of you and/or that you are able to be pussy whipped which can only end in heartbreak/break up,domestic violence,or misery and being whipped like a little bitch boy.<br /><br />19.Its always easier to go into a social situation with a wingman.A wingman is a close friend who has no intentions on getting this girl but instead goes into the situation with you to talk you up and make you seem like more of a bad ass than james bonde.He can fabricate stories of how much ass you kick on a daily basis (or it could be true depending on who you are) or he could talk about how much he envies you.Its the ultimate friend coming into a situation for the sole purpose of making you look good in comparison to him and all other guys.The wingman will put himself down and put you up.He will talk about only the things that you are good about without being to obvious.The wingman doesn&#039;t do this just because though lol usually youll have to be his wingman the next night or he can save it and use you as a wingman when he sees a girl he really wants to fuck.<br /><br />20.There is a difference between being smart,clever,and charismatic and being a fake,asshole,and complete dick.There are several perfect examples for this.One example would be lames who think they&#039;re hard ass mixed martial arts kung fu gods because they wear tapout shirts and play UFC on xbox live and beat someone these are the people that you can make fun of our talk shit to because they act like hard asses and naive people think they&#039;re hard when in reality they are weak and pussies and would never actually fight someone.So when you talk shit to them you automatically create an impression that you are even more fearless and hard then &quot;MMA hard ass ufc jujitsu karate bros&quot; another example would be talking shit to pathetic little guys who think they know about guns and honestly think they could survive in a warzone because they play black ops.When in reality they have no idea what the difference between a 9mm,a .50 AE shot from a desert eagle and a .50 shot from a M82,.45,or think that an AK shoots .223 bullets.So how the fuck can they think they will survive a warzone or know how a weapon kicks or how to load or drop a clip? They dont they just like to talk shit and people like this are fun to call out and talk shit to because they ask for it and it proves your intellectual superiority over the person.<br /><br />21.Don&#039;t trust anyone.If you dont trust anyone you can never be let down in any situation including a social situation.And dont care about what other people say.<br /><br />This was long and drawn out I just spent about 20 minutes typing this shit.And I know Ill end up getting negative karma for it but oh well.If you are seriously trolling and not looking for legitimate advice then I hope you burn in hell you dirty bastard.If you were serious and not trolling then I hope all that shit I just typed helps you out.And remember humans are filthy greedy selfish little creatures and usually they just want attention they think they deserve,money,or sex.Tell them what they want to hear,bullshit,and lie and you will flourish in our fucked up world.Be a nice guy and never get the girl,sex,money,or any other pleasures this isnt a movie acted out in hollywood this is real life and shits fucked up so you have to be even more fucked up to win we live in a world that celebrates and praises the fucked up aspects of life like TV jersey shore consists of orange guidos fucking everything that walks they get money to do this and are famous for the,sex in the city doesnt even need an explanation,pornstars like jenna jameson are more well known and heard of than nobel peace prize winner.In our music we glorify death in our death metal,black metal,and hip hop we glorify robberies in music,we glorify rape and sodomy in music like tyler,the creator we glorify all types of shit in our music like whores and bitches getting famous for being whores and bitches like paris hilton,kim kardashian,snooki,ect... In our world we glorify authority figures and police when they kill our youth and beat our elderly and the news for christs sake! They are mainstream news chanels and even they only talk about death,murder corruption,animal abuse,rapes,child molestation,thefts,and they lie and lie and lie and lie and brainwash.In a world like this what makes you think you will get anywhere being good? The president lies,the pope lies and covers up child molestations,the teachers and coaches molest children,the actresses are sluts and encourage the youth to be sluts,the musicians do the same,all of these fucked up people didnt get famous and then become fucked up they got famous because they&#039;re fucked up I bet in my country we know more about death,sex,corruption,and lies more than we know of our own history.You have to be a cold person to get anywhere you have to be ready to be deceived when it happens you have to take part in it to win,.Its survival of the fittest and the majority of humans are naive,trusting,gullible,easy to read,and even more easy to manipulate.So if you really want something just go get it all of it is much easier than you think.If the person is not a friend and if you have no feelings for the person the person can easily be used as a tool for your own desires.People do it everyday.Politicians do it all day every day.No person is innocent and no person is better than another so its not that big of a deal to me and if the person is not a trustworthy person they will fuck you over just the same.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />DAYUM Pineapples, I think that is the smartest shit I have ever heard you say! <br /><br />The above advice is legit, if you didnt know it already...you ARE a scrub. Too late for you, trim your&nbsp; stache and just jump off a bridge!

see what I did? You compliment the body but make sure that you separate the human girl with emotions and a brain and thoughts from the body of the human girl.Because it is a turn off for girls in farther stages of relationships if the only thing that they are worth to you is there body.They want you to love emotionally and connect mentally and to see them for them as in personality and thoughts and opinions,but also the body,its very tricky to get this part down pat.Things they also want from conversations is gratification/thanks/rewards,thoughtful responses,putting them up while putting other girls down,building there confidence/self esteem,consoling,letting them know that you are there/wont abandon them,letting them vent/talk about issues,and anything that makes them feel special and or unique or above the general population.Be careful though make sure they know you dont take shit or when you put them on this pedestal they will be delusional and think they are in charge of you and/or that you are able to be pussy whipped which can only end in heartbreak/break up,domestic violence,or misery and being whipped like a little bitch boy.<br /><br />19.Its always easier to go into a social situation with a wingman.A wingman is a close friend who has no intentions on getting this girl but instead goes into the situation with you to talk you up and make you seem like more of a bad ass than james bonde.He can fabricate stories of how much ass you kick on a daily basis (or it could be true depending on who you are) or he could talk about how much he envies you.Its the ultimate friend coming into a situation for the sole purpose of making you look good in comparison to him and all other guys.The wingman will put himself down and put you up.He will talk about only the things that you are good about without being to obvious.The wingman doesn&#039;t do this just because though lol usually youll have to be his wingman the next night or he can save it and use you as a wingman when he sees a girl he really wants to fuck.<br /><br />20.There is a difference between being smart,clever,and charismatic and being a fake,asshole,and complete dick.There are several perfect examples for this.One example would be lames who think they&#039;re hard ass mixed martial arts kung fu gods because they wear tapout shirts and play UFC on xbox live and beat someone these are the people that you can make fun of our talk shit to because they act like hard asses and naive people think they&#039;re hard when in reality they are weak and pussies and would never actually fight someone.So when you talk shit to them you automatically create an impression that you are even more fearless and hard then &quot;MMA hard ass ufc jujitsu karate bros&quot; another example would be talking shit to pathetic little guys who think they know about guns and honestly think they could survive in a warzone because they play black ops.When in reality they have no idea what the difference between a 9mm,a .50 AE shot from a desert eagle and a .50 shot from a M82,.45,or think that an AK shoots .223 bullets.So how the fuck can they think they will survive a warzone or know how a weapon kicks or how to load or drop a clip? They dont they just like to talk shit and people like this are fun to call out and talk shit to because they ask for it and it proves your intellectual superiority over the person.<br /><br />21.Don&#039;t trust anyone.If you dont trust anyone you can never be let down in any situation including a social situation.And dont care about what other people say.<br /><br />This was long and drawn out I just spent about 20 minutes typing this shit.And I know Ill end up getting negative karma for it but oh well.If you are seriously trolling and not looking for legitimate advice then I hope you burn in hell you dirty bastard.If you were serious and not trolling then I hope all that shit I just typed helps you out.And remember humans are filthy greedy selfish little creatures and usually they just want attention they think they deserve,money,or sex.Tell them what they want to hear,bullshit,and lie and you will flourish in our fucked up world.Be a nice guy and never get the girl,sex,money,or any other pleasures this isnt a movie acted out in hollywood this is real life and shits fucked up so you have to be even more fucked up to win we live in a world that celebrates and praises the fucked up aspects of life like TV jersey shore consists of orange guidos fucking everything that walks they get money to do this and are famous for the,sex in the city doesnt even need an explanation,pornstars like jenna jameson are more well known and heard of than nobel peace prize winner.In our music we glorify death in our death metal,black metal,and hip hop we glorify robberies in music,we glorify rape and sodomy in music like tyler,the creator we glorify all types of shit in our music like whores and bitches getting famous for being whores and bitches like paris hilton,kim kardashian,snooki,ect... In our world we glorify authority figures and police when they kill our youth and beat our elderly and the news for christs sake! They are mainstream news chanels and even they only talk about death,murder corruption,animal abuse,rapes,child molestation,thefts,and they lie and lie and lie and lie and brainwash.In a world like this what makes you think you will get anywhere being good? The president lies,the pope lies and covers up child molestations,the teachers and coaches molest children,the actresses are sluts and encourage the youth to be sluts,the musicians do the same,all of these fucked up people didnt get famous and then become fucked up they got famous because they&#039;re fucked up I bet in my country we know more about death,sex,corruption,and lies more than we know of our own history.You have to be a cold person to get anywhere you have to be ready to be deceived when it happens you have to take part in it to win,.Its survival of the fittest and the majority of humans are naive,trusting,gullible,easy to read,and even more easy to manipulate.So if you really want something just go get it all of it is much easier than you think.If the person is not a friend and if you have no feelings for the person the person can easily be used as a tool for your own desires.People do it everyday.Politicians do it all day every day.No person is innocent and no person is better than another so its not that big of a deal to me and if the person is not a trustworthy person they will fuck you over just the same.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh my god.

				This is impressive, and... Fuck, dude I don&#039;t have a problem but I learned a couple of things. The most impressive thing is the time and effort you spent to a total stranger, who I was a little embarrassed for, because he asked such a sad question on a forum of probably the most narcissistic, openly mean people I have encountered in any chat forum I have read, except for a forum for anger management. Hats off to you.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I was going to put something constructive until i read this post, seriously pissed myself laughing at this.<br />The topic of this thread reminds of the big bang theory when sheldon goes to the kids section of the library to read books on how to get friends.<br />On a serious note though, personally i just get on with life and do whatever the fuck i want, when i want.&nbsp; As long as the main things in life are taken care of, like family and money, the rest just rolls on by.<br />Why do you even care about anything other than that??<br />Oh, and of course people on here matter, but i think you might have pissed on your chips there a bit by starting up this fucking ridiculous thread.&nbsp; Honestly mate, get over yourself.<br />[/quote]

				@Hydro2<br /><br />IF you want to get involved and post your personal feelings, learn how to insert quotes properly.&nbsp; That was infact my post and i wasnt trying to come across as cruel or unheartly.&nbsp; I was basically trying to say that in order to get people to like you, you need to learn how to move on with your life first.&nbsp; Everything else just falls into place.<br />And besides, if you do not agree or like how people are being here then why the fuck did you post in the first place?<br />If i felt as strongly about it as you did i would have just walked away.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m guessing your just another person jumping on that internet forum chat bandwagon eh?.<br />Go and set up your own emo forum thread, maybe you will have better luck there.<br />Dickhead.

				@ Adasel... You misunderstood me, I am impressed with what you said, and how applies everyday life. Actually, tell me how I could made my note so you don&#039;t feel I am messing your Karma. I think you my point, when I said this brings the meanness in people, and I apologize for any anxiety. <br />I feel for the guy that you gave the advice to, and he just needs to know he&#039;s not alone, and we all go through those times of self doubt.<br />&nbsp;

				Of course he is not alone, and do not worry you did not mess with my karma, it takes a hell of a lot to do that mate.<br />The reason he posts here is because in reality he knows MOST people are here for him

Sports,work,games,drugs,sex,everything.Just act as if you&#039;re better than everyone at everything even if you suck at what you&#039;re talking about and play it off if someone challenges you and you think youll lose.Or go all try hard and actually exert enough energy to beat the competition.<br /><br />8.LIE.lie lie lie lie lie.Period.Everyone lies.Lies help us get an advantage in a situation.If someone tells you that lying will always catch up with you or any of that bullshit they&#039;re just saying that because they dont like being lied to or its them tricking you into telling the truth.But if at all possible dont lie to your partner and try to avoid lying to family.Unless its in the best interest of them.For example if it would crush your mothers heart if she found out you do heroin and she asks if you&#039;re high just lie &quot;no I just feel pretty lethargic and beat down from not getting any sleep last night.&quot; If your girlfriend tells you that your eyes look red and glassy be like &quot;yeah its these god damn allergies I swear they get me every year&quot; then quickly make it look more believable by making her go to the store to get some zyrtec.Lies are a great tool in social situations especially ones on vacation or at parties because you know the girl you&#039;re lying to is just gunna be a hit it and quit it anyway never to be seen or heard from again.<br /><br />9.Don&#039;t be a scrub.Take showers.Put on cologne.Deodorant.Clean matching clothes.All that shit.<br /><br />10.Don&#039;t be a pussy.Rejection occasionally is just part of the game.Don&#039;t take criticism to heart.I always find it helpful when someone criticizes me if I just look them up and down scope them out and then realize that they are no better if not worse than I am.Ugly,fat,bitch tits,obnoxious,loud,low IQ.It always helps to realize that another human can and will point out your flaws all through life but then again they have flaws too.And you could even talk shit back if you want depending on if the situation is appropriate for shit talking (a little nobody,a cop if you did nothing illegal,a teacher,a coed,pretty much any little cock sucker who means nothing) like if you&#039;re girls ex says something to you just say &quot; yeah well you got a small dick your ex told me&quot; hahah that kills guys inside and it really does take a critical hit on their self esteem.If its really necessary to argue or talk back women are easily offended by calling them fat,ugly,hoes,whores(especially if they really are!),cunts,worthless,ect... and this will probably end the argument pretty quickly,some things that always get to a guy are telling them they have a small dick,telling them they are weak or not powerful or strong,telling them that they are homosexual/gay/faggots/queers/turd burglers/cum guzzlers/cock suckers.<br /><br />11.Cant stress enough about being all cleaned up,teeth brushed,hair combed,shaved,dressed proper,ect... Kinda considered &quot;metrosexual&quot; but I go so far as to wear spring/summer/fall/winter clothes and colognes that go along with the season or weather,then of course different colognes and clothes for night time and day time.Also dont over dress because that&#039;s also pretty gay and people will think you&#039;re weird as fuck and/or psychopathic if you show up to a frat party with a cannibal corpse shirt,some black goth pants,and a creepy ass spiked choker.Also dont show up to a formal or semi formal gathering wearing some baggy ass PRPS jeans,fitted cap,ghetto ass shirt,with your fancy little Swiss watch and your neck all blinged out.And the only other thing I can think of other than that is if you have tattoos if you&#039;re in a professional environment keep them covered I have lots of problems with this.Women like men who are dressed nice,its no different for women.What would you prefer? A hard body bitch dressed nice smelling nice with a clean and shaved pussy? Or would you prefer the fat bitch with the matted hair smelling like piss with a hairy and fishy scented snatch? Exactly haha you dont want to hook up with nasty bitches,girls dont wanna fuck nasty guys its simple.<br /><br />12.Some things are better kept to yourself especially if you&#039;re around close minded,crazy ass conservative people whos brains are stuck in the 1800&#039;s.Things that should be kept to yourself at all times around these people are politics ESPECIALLY gay marriage,abortions,presidential candidates,ect... because this can make or break deals,conversations,it can be a total buzz kill if you&#039;re high,and no one wants to get pissed over such stupid things.Don&#039;t talk about sex around these people,dont talk about drugs,dont talk about religion,masturbation,what you do in your past time such as watching porn,killing animals,playing with fire,watching snuff films,ect...<br /><br />13.Conversation is easy if you&#039;re attentive.I love playing the conversation game its simple you look at your surroundings,take mental notes on what you see ex. music cds,games,books,companies,television shows,pretty much anything that the person likes.Then let the bullshit fly..You see a Slayer CD so you say dude do you know the band slayer? &quot;Oh my god dude I love slayer! I have like 5 of there cds&quot; then youre just respond exitedly &quot;dude no way! Lets listen to some slayer!&quot; then they&#039;re in a good mood because they&#039;re listening to music they like and they already feel you because you have something in common.Bullshit some more &quot;I think my dad knows how to play this on guitar&quot; blah blah blah.Then do it all over again just be attentive to how they react to certain subjects,take mental notes on things that the person has said they like or things that are laying around there house chances are if they have like 50 xbox games they probably like playing xbox so with this tiny observation you can think of a popular game that you have played that everyone else has played like halo,or Modern Warfare 3,or black ops and then start a conversation.Once again they will be drawn to you because they think you have so much in common.This is a GREAT trick to use on girls.<br /><br />14.Girls are the easiest to talk to because they&#039;re so god damn naive and easy to manipulate lmao.All you have to do is start a conversation give a compliment or two,abruptly end the conversation leaving them baffled and wanting more,come back later and get the number but this time bullshit and give compliments real compliments like &quot;damn you have gorgeous eyes,Ive never seen another person with eyes like yours&quot; This is a good compliment because it makes them feel unique and special.Act like you dont wanna fuck.A bad compliment would be like &quot;Damn you have gorgeous eyes,I wish I could pop them out and keep them in a glass jar.&quot; and unless the girl is being painfully obvious about being down to fuck then just dont say anything straight forward like &quot;Hey sexy can I toss your salad in the bathroom?&quot; its smarter to move things to a different more quiet location after the compliments ask if she wants to go back to your place,if you&#039;re at school ask her if you can walk her to her locker,if all signs were good it is possible to fuck and its definitely possible if not probable that you will get a kiss.But for the love of god get close to her face and look at her and if she pulls back,takes a step back,turns her head,or just looks stressed or unsure about it then you need to step back and play it off.If you read these signals wrong and you go in for the kiss or the ol&#039; ass grab or maybe a nipple rub then you are fucked lmao and everything you just said and everything you just went through failed and is pointless and you have to start all the way over with a different girl at a different place and you just wasted an hour of your life.Humans are easy to read in person its honestly not that hard but Ive seen people fuck up the ending right before the final objective (getting it in,making out and then getting it in) is executed.And it seems like people are usually pretty humiliated and disappointed even though its a fail so great that you have to laugh at the amateur that was so close but couldn&#039;t quite seal the deal...But its life I suppose.<br /><br />15.Its always easy to bullshit old folks too.Because people do small talk they dont do long in depth conversations.So all you have to do is look up some bullshit gay ass propaganda spreading media source like faux news.Oops I meant fox.And then read a few articles and then use this as a tool.<br /><br />16.Its super fun to conversate when you&#039;re stoned.It doesn&#039;t matter if Im sober or high though I always look at socializing as a game of sorts.Its pleasing and somewhat humorous to know that you fooled another person intellectually.The guys think that you are awesome and the girls want to give your dick a massage all because you used your wits and cleverness to be in complete control of the conversation and to bullshit your way into the hearts of many.<br /><br />17.All humans are looking for the same thing when they socialize.If you are talking to a guy they want gratification for something they did &quot;props dude that was a pretty sick swoosh!&quot;,attention a.k.a. pretend like you a give a fuck about the shit that is spewing from his mouth,answers,trust,consolations,bullshit compliments about bravery/courage,and in general nothing important.These things dont always apply to friends and they dont always apply online only on facebook,twitter,ect... where you are dealing with people you might know and sites that a potential employer can look.<br /><br />18.What girls want from the conversation are compliments about anything to do with their appearance like hair,teeth,physique,ass,tits,whatever,they love compliments about personality (especially if you have been talking to the girl for an extended period.First compliments on appearance,then compliments on personality) if the girl is in love with you be sure to completely detach the appearance from the personality girls hate to be only thought of because of the appearance which is ironic because they&#039;re so worried about there appearance all the time.But a good example would be &quot;You are so sexy, I love you&#039;re body,and I wouldn&#039;t trade it for anything because it belongs to the girl I love&quot; see what I did? You compliment the body but make sure that you separate the human girl with emotions and a brain and thoughts from the body of the human girl.Because it is a turn off for girls in farther stages of relationships if the only thing that they are worth to you is there body.They want you to love emotionally and connect mentally and to see them for them as in personality and thoughts and opinions,but also the body,its very tricky to get this part down pat.Things they also want from conversations is gratification/thanks/rewards,thoughtful responses,putting them up while putting other girls down,building there confidence/self esteem,consoling,letting them know that you are there/wont abandon them,letting them vent/talk about issues,and anything that makes them feel special and or unique or above the general population.Be careful though make sure they know you dont take shit or when you put them on this pedestal they will be delusional and think they are in charge of you and/or that you are able to be pussy whipped which can only end in heartbreak/break up,domestic violence,or misery and being whipped like a little bitch boy.<br /><br />19.Its always easier to go into a social situation with a wingman.A wingman is a close friend who has no intentions on getting this girl but instead goes into the situation with you to talk you up and make you seem like more of a bad ass than james bonde.He can fabricate stories of how much ass you kick on a daily basis (or it could be true depending on who you are) or he could talk about how much he envies you.Its the ultimate friend coming into a situation for the sole purpose of making you look good in comparison to him and all other guys.The wingman will put himself down and put you up.He will talk about only the things that you are good about without being to obvious.The wingman doesn&#039;t do this just because though lol usually youll have to be his wingman the next night or he can save it and use you as a wingman when he sees a girl he really wants to fuck.<br /><br />20.There is a difference between being smart,clever,and charismatic and being a fake,asshole,and complete dick.There are several perfect examples for this.One example would be lames who think they&#039;re hard ass mixed martial arts kung fu gods because they wear tapout shirts and play UFC on xbox live and beat someone these are the people that you can make fun of our talk shit to because they act like hard asses and naive people think they&#039;re hard when in reality they are weak and pussies and would never actually fight someone.So when you talk shit to them you automatically create an impression that you are even more fearless and hard then &quot;MMA hard ass ufc jujitsu karate bros&quot; another example would be talking shit to pathetic little guys who think they know about guns and honestly think they could survive in a warzone because they play black ops.When in reality they have no idea what the difference between a 9mm,a .50 AE shot from a desert eagle and a .50 shot from a M82,.45,or think that an AK shoots .223 bullets.So how the fuck can they think they will survive a warzone or know how a weapon kicks or how to load or drop a clip? They dont they just like to talk shit and people like this are fun to call out and talk shit to because they ask for it and it proves your intellectual superiority over the person.<br /><br />21.Don&#039;t trust anyone.If you dont trust anyone you can never be let down in any situation including a social situation.And dont care about what other people say.<br /><br />This was long and drawn out I just spent about 20 minutes typing this shit.And I know Ill end up getting negative karma for it but oh well.If you are seriously trolling and not looking for legitimate advice then I hope you burn in hell you dirty bastard.If you were serious and not trolling then I hope all that shit I just typed helps you out.And remember humans are filthy greedy selfish little creatures and usually they just want attention they think they deserve,money,or sex.Tell them what they want to hear,bullshit,and lie and you will flourish in our fucked up world.Be a nice guy and never get the girl,sex,money,or any other pleasures this isnt a movie acted out in hollywood this is real life and shits fucked up so you have to be even more fucked up to win we live in a world that celebrates and praises the fucked up aspects of life like TV jersey shore consists of orange guidos fucking everything that walks they get money to do this and are famous for the,sex in the city doesnt even need an explanation,pornstars like jenna jameson are more well known and heard of than nobel peace prize winner.In our music we glorify death in our death metal,black metal,and hip hop we glorify robberies in music,we glorify rape and sodomy in music like tyler,the creator we glorify all types of shit in our music like whores and bitches getting famous for being whores and bitches like paris hilton,kim kardashian,snooki,ect...

The president lies,the pope lies and covers up child molestations,the teachers and coaches molest children,the actresses are sluts and encourage the youth to be sluts,the musicians do the same,all of these fucked up people didnt get famous and then become fucked up they got famous because they&#039;re fucked up I bet in my country we know more about death,sex,corruption,and lies more than we know of our own history.You have to be a cold person to get anywhere you have to be ready to be deceived when it happens you have to take part in it to win,.Its survival of the fittest and the majority of humans are naive,trusting,gullible,easy to read,and even more easy to manipulate.So if you really want something just go get it all of it is much easier than you think.If the person is not a friend and if you have no feelings for the person the person can easily be used as a tool for your own desires.People do it everyday.Politicians do it all day every day.No person is innocent and no person is better than another so its not that big of a deal to me and if the person is not a trustworthy person they will fuck you over just the same.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jesus. I stopped reading this post and picked up War and Peace instead, it was an easier read. Without even reading this wall of text, I think its safe to say DON&#039;T take how not to be a loser advice from somebody who pens a novel as a response to a random troll question

Profile pic being the same doesn&#039;t really help.<br /><br />All I can add is its hard to get rid of the label of a &quot;druggie&quot;. There are a lot of people who won&#039;t forget your personal preferences and will hold them against you even when you&#039;ve cleaned up your act.<br />Get involved in new social groups with the new improved you, go back to college/uni, get a new job and make sure you are talking to people. Try make new friends but always be true to yourself... don&#039;t change your personality just because it will make you popular because it won&#039;t last and you will end up making yourself miserable trying to be someone your not. Just be yourself but never mention drugs in a conversation unless someone else drops the hint first.<br /><br />Good Luck :)<br />

				Yeah i have to agree.&nbsp; If you are that worried about the next time you leave the front door and how people view you, if it really is that bad, then either therapy or hypnosis of some kind might help out.<br />I bought CD&#039;s for both smoking and drinking.&nbsp; Although they helped me out somewhat, by that i mean cutting down, i hear that paying for an actual hypnotherapist has like an 85 per cent success rate.<br />But hey, its gotta be worth a try.

				I actually reckon that face book has an awful lot to answer for.&nbsp; Because of this &quot;social network&quot;, we have become a society of stay indoors, less sociable creatures as an ironic result.<br />Its more of a question of, do i look good enough to post my picture on some bullshit website.<br />The advent of technology and adverse use of the internet has changed peoples ideas about everyone.<br /><br />I always believed that the key to life was perception.&nbsp; Its how YOU see the world, not how everyone sees you.<br />If people like you, good enough for me, if they dont then forget about them.<br />Not being a religious person i cannot tell someone that they should be happy with what gave them, but as someone who is on the other side of the fence, a non-believer, i think we should all be happy with what our parents, and our ancestors made us to be.<br />I dont like the idea of plastic surgery unless someone has had some terrible accident and needs something drastic like a face rebuild.<br />I am also far from the best looking guy on the planet but over the years i have come to accept who and what i am.<br />This is not a vanity card or anything, but i hope that over time the OP can begin to think along these lines as well, he will be a lot happier for it.
