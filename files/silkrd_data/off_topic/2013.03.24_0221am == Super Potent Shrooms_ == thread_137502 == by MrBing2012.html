				I just bought some shrooms and I asked the vendor how much to take for a moderate trip and he told me 1 gram. Is that really enough for a good trip?<br />I keep hearing people say a cube is a cube so I can&#039;t imagine that they are 3x more potent then regular shrooms but I dunno.<br />The listing says PSILOCIBE CUBENSIS MEX A++++<br /><br />So do you think 1gram is enough for a decent trip? <br />

				I&#039;d eat a full 3.5 grams. Though honestly 5G should be the standard dosage.

				Nobody wants anyone to freak out. :-) <br /><br />1 gram is good if its potent shrooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;But even the , 3 grams will be a fun ride and won&#039;t be dangerous or anything .&nbsp; Might as well.&nbsp; It&#039;s always easier to go up in dose than down, but it sucks to only have one gram around when you want to get higher.&nbsp;

				I think I`m gonna stay on the safe side and only eat 1.5grams with another gram soaking in lemon juice in case I want to redose.

				You should try making shroom smoothies. Blend fruit + shrooms and drink the shroom shake. No taste, tons vitamin C, and allot easier on the stomach.<br />I forget at times people can be uncomfortable with some higher doses, we all seek a different place. Good luck on your journey no matter the dosage.

				I know a cube is a cube and all but man the PE strains have always done more for me. If you like tuna fish it is great for hiding the taste and makes a thick sandwich with cold tuna. Don&#039;t never mix it with hot foods as heat always has lessened the potency for me. Cyclones PE mutants have been the best I&#039;ve had and I only had 1.5 gram of them. I ate them straight with no food or anything. I just drink a soda while eating them and had great visuals and an awesome body buzz for 10 hours. <br /><br />I&#039;m very happy tho with GT&#039;s fro Jiu Jitsu or Main stays shrooms are great also for a very affordable price.

I ate 3.5 grams the first time and 5 the second. 1 grams is kinda a joke if your looking for a memorable experience. Id go anywhere from 4 to 5 depending on bravery.

Don`t really want too much of a mindfuck.<br />I plan on just relaxing at home alone watching Planet Earth and playing AudioSurf.<br /><br />Its just hard to believe that they are so potent as well as so cheap. All the other shrooms on SR were around $10/gram but these were only $5.

				I just got some shrooms from mushroomgirl.. It only took a gram to feel it.&nbsp; &nbsp;My buddy and I at an 1/8th and it was pretty intense.&nbsp; A friend came over and ate less than a gram and still was geekin out with us :)<br /><br />Theres definitely varying potency depending on how they were grown, moreso than the strain.<br /><br />Also, I wouldn&#039;t start with an 1/8th unless you are very used to tripping.. you can always eat more but you can&#039;t eat less... start with a gram or two, wait an hour then eat more.
