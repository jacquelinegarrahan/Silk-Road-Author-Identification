				I do worry, at one point I gave him my address in attempt to purchase. This was done before I was aware of his reputation. Lets hope he stays honorable for the sake of decency.

				LMAO @ this thread.<br /><br />Holy crap you, how can you tell when nobody likes you? Some random dude starts a thread to ban you for life from the forums! LOL.<br /><br />On the other hand op, dont hate, participate. Mister Dank may be a douche......ok i dont really know where to go from there.....maybe he should be banned.......no wait, he has just as much a right to be here as anyone else. Plus the constant abuse he takes can be entertaining when i want a good laugh after puffin a J&nbsp; ;)

				What and waste a perfectly good user account ::)<br /><br />You may not like what he says, but as long as he isn&#039;t threatening buyers.<br />Wait he he reported them as all LE. Tin Foil hats on. (I maybe exaggerating a little)<br /><br />Use two tin foil hats for extra safety.

				I would ban any vendor who releases information on any buyers address, asap and forever. I&#039;ve never had any problems with him, but personally I feel even threatening to release someone&#039;s address is pretty shitty, if he did actually release anyones address then I&#039;d say he should be banned and would be disappointed if a vendor who did such were allowed to make 1 sale after doing such.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what anyone says on the forum, I think the less moderation on the forum (aside from spam) the better, and the reason why I&#039;m loving this forum is for the lack of censorship.
