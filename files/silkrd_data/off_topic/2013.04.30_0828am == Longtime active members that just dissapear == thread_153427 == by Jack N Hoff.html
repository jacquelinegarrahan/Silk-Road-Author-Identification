				Does anyone ever notice longtime active members that suddenly dispensary and never login again and wonder what happened to them?&nbsp; I know I do.<br /><br />LSDank is an example.&nbsp; http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=profile;u=218<br />He was an active member for 17 months and suddenly disappeared out of nowhere five months ago.<br /><br />I was just wondering if I am the only one who gets curious when they see things like this.

				I wonder too<br /><br />We are playing a dangerous game here though.&nbsp; People can get busted or maybe just change screen names to protect themselves.

				My activity on here dropped by a large amount as well, I think us dinosaurs are just too busy with other things to be active on the forums. We also like to lurk on IRC&nbsp; ;)

				I&#039;ve had an active buyer account for well over a year. I went three months without logging in to this account. The forums went to utter shit and I lost thousands upon thousands of dollars in BTC. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a dinosaur yet, but I lurk and pick and choose when to post. <br /><br />

				I think it&#039;s only smart to kill off old avies after a time and start fresh. As much as we try to not reveal too much information, we inadvertently let bits slip every now and then.

				Yup, I&#039;m with you there. I&#039;ve seen some pretty good vendors just disappear and you always wonder what really happened to them! I remember I had an order with one (think called misterwizard) and right when I ordered he disappeared with his listings up and all. Needed to wait to cancel&nbsp; which was annoying, but it goes to show thats the good about staying in escrow! If I had been required to FE, I&#039;d been shit out of luck.
