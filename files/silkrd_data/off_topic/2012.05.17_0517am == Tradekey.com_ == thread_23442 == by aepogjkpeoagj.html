				Tradekey is a Pakistan-run wholesale website that sources a lot of stuff, including drugs apparently. Has anyone dealt with them? I send a message to one vendor purportedly selling a kg of LSD and a bunch of other dudes came out of the woodwork and started emailing me saying they have really cheap LSD. But the fucked up thing is that they all want Western Union and email from hushmail and hotmail accounts, which is retarded.<br /><br />SafeorScam says there are some good vendors in there but it seems like a stretch. Has anyone bought from Tradekey or another site like it?

				It&#039;s &#039;possible&#039; that you could find a legit vendor on here, but EXTREMELY unlikely. I believe listings are free so there&#039;s so many damn scams on there its not worth it. Stay away from this site if you&#039;re buying anything illegal.

You will get jacked.

				Well that&#039;s disappointing. Surely one of them is legit. I wish someone would chime in who is legit on there rather than keep it to themselves.

				Even if you did find a legit vendor, like i said on the other thread its going down the same route as the farmers market, no anonymity at all.
