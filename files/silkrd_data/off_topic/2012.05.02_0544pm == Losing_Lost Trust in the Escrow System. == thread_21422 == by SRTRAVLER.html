				The escrow system has helped me out only when I do not receive a product in the mail and there is no DCN, but scammers have found ways around this. <br /><br />The only way I have lost money through silk road escrow system is from scammers sending bunk product in the mail with DCN.&nbsp; There is no way for the silk road staff to know for sure if he sent bunk product or not.&nbsp; And on top of this the scammers manipulates the silk road staff by stating the buyer is using the feedback system against the seller to get money if the buyer ever asks for money back and mentions feedback.<br /><br />i have 90 transactions and all have been in escrow. I have lost money three times through escrow,&nbsp; Once i got 50% refund, another 25% refund, and recently 0% refund.<br /><br />bunk coke, misadvertised lsd dosage, and bunk hash made from shwag.<br /><br /><br />Something needs to be done.<br /><br /><br />I have lost my trust in the escrow system.

				OP, your post stinks of BS.<br /><br />If a vendor does what you claim, you have the ability to trash their feedback and ruin their business. No vendor that is trying to build or maintain a reputation on here is going to purposely try to scam you.

				hahaha!<br /><br />This is a joke right? You have a 3.33% being ripped off rate. And you got money back for them TWICE out of the three times.

				I thought the escrow system was for non-delivery of product. Not expectations or disappointment of quality. In my mind, that sounds like you&#039;re abusing the escrow system and SR support is getting wise to it. <br /><br />Just sayin&#039;.

The best way to stop scammers is the community as we have seen constantly. When paythepiper scammed everyone he came back as someone else and right away the community pointed it out and he was banned again and most likely won&#039;t be coming back. If everyone posted feedback on the forums about a specific vendor/product then it would be a lot harder for a vendor to scam.

				Yes, the escrow system is in place to protect buyers from... LEGITIMATE scams. Non-delivery being the most legitimate. <br /><br />Tell me this; for what you claim to be bunk junk, were there any forum threads about what you received as being bunk? Because if there were, you would simply need to copy the link into your resolution comments as proof that you received bunk junk along with others. Otherwise, it&#039;s just your uncorroborated word that it was bunk junk. <br /><br />See where I&#039;m going?<br /><br />Selective scams are mostly done with early finalization. When sending out bunk product, usually a few people get the same and report the same. When an individual reports it, it looks like the individual is trying to scam the seller or is simply dissatisfied (buyers remorse).&nbsp; You can&#039;t expect the escrow system to work like Amazon&#039;s customer service. <br /><br />You claiming a product isn&#039;t as &quot;pure&quot; as advertizing is not going to get far. In fact, I&#039;m surprised you got anything for that. These are drugs. You could have taken something else with it or a few days before that made it seem weaker than described. You might have built up a tolerance that hasn&#039;t dissipated yet.&nbsp; <br />

You are tying the quality of hash to the quality of bud it was made from, when that has little to do with it. Hash quality has a lot more to do with how it was made. You can make great hash from shitty weed and shitty hash from the kindest chronic.

				i know nothing about pot or hash really (other than that it&#039;s fun) but there are other psychoactive cannabinoids in pot aside from THC. So there may be something to the argument that &quot;good&quot; pot produces good hash.

				Ok you guys have a point, thc is thc.&nbsp; &nbsp;guess I am not explaining myself properly, so I will add this in conjunction to what I am saying.<br /><br /><br />Your egos are getting in the way.&nbsp; Chemisty degree do not replace ten years of smoking experience.<br /><br />Hash is not pure THC.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you make hash with swchag you get a lower quality high, because of the mix of cannabinoids in the bud due to how it is grown.<br /><br />So I will say this again, Hash in not pure thc.&nbsp; It is a mixture of thc and cannabinoids that are present due to how well the plant is grown.<br /><br />&nbsp;The marijuana bud, after all has more cannabinoids than thc in it.<br /><br />You have shitty weed, you get shitty hash, ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.&nbsp; lol.<br /><br />High quality marijuana gets me way more high than Moroccan hash made from shitty weed.<br /><br />And please give me negative feedback, im goin for a record here on SR! thank you.<br /><br /><br />

				SRTRAVELLER is right folks.<br />There are good hashes and bad ones.<br />The best are made from the best weed, and the worst is made from the worst.<br />Order 1g of paperchasings hash, and 1g of polm 0 from dutch... can you guess which one will make you higher?&nbsp; I can almost guarantee they are made the same way, but from different sources of weed.<br />Ask the guys yourself.&nbsp; Dutch and paper I think would agree.<br /><br />THC gets you high, but the other cannabinoids make that high something special.<br />There&#039;s a reason med patients prefer pot/hash/edibles over THC pills.<br /><br />Regardless of which pot you use though, the hash you make will be more potent than the original product, because you are concentrating it and smoking less plant material.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had oil extractions from shitty pot that were not as potent as good bud.&nbsp; There was no plant material in there, but there was little action from the cannabinoids either.

				For the purposes of this discussion, lets say everyone knows how to use bubble bags, and/or advanced hashmaking techniques and these two hashes are being made by the same person, using the same technique.<br />Theoretically, lets say the bombass weed has 25%THC and other related cannibinoids, and the schwag has 15%.<br />1oz of BOMB would yield approximately 7g of THC and related cannibinoids if extracted 100%,<br />while the 2oz of schwag would yield 8.4g of of THC and related cannibinoids. Not a huge difference, EXCEPT you have plant matter in some cases (the final few passes using larger micron screens), and cell walls from the trichomes in ALL cases, unless you&#039;re making oil.&nbsp; So from the 2oz there would be more cell walls contributing to the hash to yield the 8.4g than from the 1oz of BOMB.&nbsp; NOTE: these gram estimates do NOT take into account the weight of those cell walls, so the weight of the hash from the 2oz would likely be more than that of the 1oz and would therefore be less potent gram per gram.<br /><br />IF they had the same ratios of THC to related cannibinoids you could POTENTIALLY have better hash from the schwag.<br /><br />What makes weed schwag though?<br /><br />1) Sometimes it&#039;s harvesting too early/late.<br />If you harvest too early, the trichs will not fall off very easily, and you will get very little hash.&nbsp; Early harvested pot/schwag is really only good for oil, and even in an indica you will get a sativa-like high due to the low THC to cannibinoid ratio.<br />If you harvest too late, you will get a LOT of trichs, as they&#039;re all stretched out and brittle, but you wind up with a heavier stone as the cannibinoid to THC ratio has a higher percentage.<br /><br />Properly harvested weed makes the best hash due to a balanced THC/cannibinoid ratio and well formed trichomes that haven&#039;t spooged all over the leaf, losing potency.&nbsp; You&#039;re looking for a T shape, with a reddish tinge running about halfway up the stalk of the trichs. (use a jewelers loupe)<br /><br />2) Sometimes it&#039;s the strain.<br />Obviously some strains are better than others, they produce not only different ratios of cannibinoids, but they also produce more or fewer trichomes.&nbsp; That&#039;s why hash makers tend to use specific strains rather than any old strain they found a seed in.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve ever bought really, really good weed it takes a lot less to get stoned than the equivalent weight in schwag. To top it all off, there are some cannibinoids present in some strains that are not found in significant amounts in others - this greatly affects the quality of the high, and the final product when you&#039;re making hash.<br /><br />If you use a bubble bag, with the smallest micron screen, and do a first pull off of schwag, and one off of bomb bud, you will get higher off the quality bud, and you will likely get a better yield of trichomes.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been smoking for almost 20 years (anniversary this summer, woohoo!) and I am a Doctor.<br />No shit.

				Proud Cannabian hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Your missing the point SRTRAVLER, the point everyone is trying to make to you but your too moronic to understand is that you can make hash from outdoor nugs that isn&#039;t as potent as you might think, so you trying to get a return on it is bullshit since there is no way for you to prove this, and you should not have been refunded anything at all - that&#039;s what feedback is for, not escrow.<br /><br />Next thing you know you&#039;ll be trying to get a refund on a bag because you found a hair in it.
