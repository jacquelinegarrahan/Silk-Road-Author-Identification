				DYOR<br /><br />Speaking from European standpoing so USA may be totally different.<br /><br />Shroomeister was right earlier. Buying a private jet sounds cool (wow, this one is only £250k) but if you&#039;re going to be landing in an internantaional airport in that may as well fly cattle class. Class snobbery exists everywhere. WHat are that couple exiting their plush £30m GS IV going to be saying seeing you waiting for the steps to be whleeled across. (hint listen for laughter)/ Then the storage, mechanics, pilots, maintenance, regultory checks&nbsp; (trusting your life in their hands do you want to scrimp?)/<br /><br />If you really feel the need to fly around chip in with 4 mates on a cheap-o Cessna, split the bills, fly around in a few circles, take some photos, pull your pilot licence out in the bar (hint 2 waste of time, you&#039;re still the same old you, winner&nbsp; or loser) and enjoy it. Maintenance may be crap and you may die at any momemnt. Or ask a former rally driver (Colin McRae, e.g.) to take your child on a joy ride! Great while it lasts, Regrets are for losers.<br /><br />THe first part of which I can tesitify is kinda cool and grouping together with a few grand each (cost of a decent car) if it&#039;s your thing. Just remember, it will be a money pit and that won#t chance over time/<br /><br />Sorry for derailing the thread. Fee free to delete, no hard feelings!

Sorry.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />THISGUY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i can buy the plane, i can pay in cash, but you are out of your mind if you want to do a business for a plane without meeting in person, sorry i guess you dont know how the airplanes business work.<br /><br />If you ever want to sell a plane without papers, i can use a plane from honduras, republica dominicana, belice, aruba or any island&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 day&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />shroomeister(100)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is for sale. I want it gone. I can answer any questions you may have, but please be able to furnish a BTC address that holds enough coins to purchase it before we go any further. That is my only protection that against wasting time.<br /><br />I have had far too many people waste my time over this thing.<br /><br />FE is a must, but we may be able to come to an understanding for a 1/2 before and 1/2 after you have received and are satisfied with the jet.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />THISGUY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you can get hand of planes i think we can work something out, i have use for any type of airplane, if you are listing this in here is because your are looking for someone that can use your plane in central and south america<br /><br />If you have real access to plane let me know&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 day</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
