				So I love watching a good documentary on pretty much any subject. It makes me feel as though I&#039;m not wasting my time drooling on myself and numbing my brain watching some stupid mindless crap that is majority of t.v and then being further dulled and enraged watching fuckstick commercials. I feel as though I&#039;m gaining some sort of useful knowledge.<br /><br />We have our movie thread and our music threads... How about some good doco&#039;s, chuck em up peeps! If you list one could you also provide a brief description... Also try to steer away from the conspiracy theory, fear mongering ones if possible. There&#039;s enough paranoia here as it is.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />- &quot; Drugs Inc. &quot; is great to watch, all about the droogs baby... All on youtube as well.<br /><br />- &quot; Bassweight &quot; About how dubstep came about<br /><br />- &quot; Infamy &quot; About the beginning days of street graffiti in L.A during the 90&#039;s<br /><br />- &quot; Piece by piece &quot; Another one about graffiti<br /><br />- &quot; Graffiti wars &quot; Have a guess what this one&#039;s about<br /><br />- &quot;BBC Planet earth&quot;<br /><br />- &quot; Ross Kemp on Gangs &quot; well... you work it out.<br /><br />I&#039;ll stop there... Let&#039;s hear some more.

				Dirty Pictures (Shulgin Documentary, on youtube)<br />Life (like the sequel to The Planet Earth)<br />Generation Kill<br />The Devil and Daniel Johnston<br />Brainman - about a man struck by lightning that became able to visualize numbers as landscapes and can do mathematical operations to better accuracy than computers, can rattle off Pi to 30k digits etc.<br /><br />I checked out drugs inc, the one on Ketamine. They really antagonize drug use and it has the &#039;extreme dude&#039; narrator voice. looks like it could be informative tho. thanks!

				Gasland - about how the US Government conglomerates are loopholing around the phracking process involved in getting natural gas and how it&#039;s ruining the US water supply (some people turn on their faucets and can literally light their tap water on fire).&nbsp; Really scary shit.<br /><br />Dear Zachary - A guy is trying to make a film for his best friend&#039;s son because his best friend died shortly after he was born.&nbsp; All hell breaks loose while he&#039;s filming the documentary.&nbsp; Seriously one of the most shocking one&#039;s I&#039;ve seen because it all unfolds as he&#039;s filming it.<br /><br />Super High Me - Doug Benson&#039;s spin off documentary of Super Size Me wherein he smokes weed constantly for 30 days to see the effects on his body.&nbsp; Good for a laugh.

				I would recommend a documentary called pyramid of waste. It&#039;s about planned obsolescence a example from the docu s about printers where they find out printers have a chip in them which make them stop working after about 40000 prints.. It also documents a meeting between the worlds light bulb producer in the 20&#039;s where they decided that they had to make the lightbulbs last shorter. Before that meeting a average lightbulb lasted 2000 hours and at the meeting they decided that they should only last 1000 hours so they could earn more money. Also a story about a lightbulb in a fire station in California wich have been lit since 1901..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />http://www.centennialbulb.org/ a site about the lightbulb from 1901

				I like documentary movies. <br /><br />&quot;Flow&quot; is a good one about water privatization and fucked up shit water Corps. are doing. <br /><br />&quot;In Pot We Trust&quot; is great weed documentary.<br /><br />There was some hour long documentary i saw on BBC where this British reporter lived in Amsterdam for like 30 days getting high, it was hilarious. <br /><br /><br />The one &quot;Ross Kemp On Gangs&quot; that i&#039;ve seen in America was held in the city i live in, which coincidentally is the episode with the most ignorant obnoxious gangsters... does me proud <br /><br /><br />I feel like you Brits get cooler documentaries on your tele than we do across the pond

				Rolling is a good movie for E lovers, it&#039;s documentary style but has a story line, really good insight into the E culture.<br /><br />I watched another one about this 40yo dad in the 90&#039;s he was a heavy raver that took E all the time and even gave his 13yo son a pill and went raving with his teen son. That was pretty good to watch.<br /><br />Drugs Inc series is also awesome, keen to check some of these other out too. Good thread.

				In the states there is a channel called CURRENT TV. Anyone who is familiar with these productions will agree it is THE SHIT!! Just a few examples of their groundbreaking masterpieces are several different docs on subjects ranging from oxycontin ( details the smuggling of oxy from florida doctors), sassafrass ( intense doc about the illegal harvesting of safrole oil from ancient trees in cambodia used to make mdma), The mexican drug cartels, (amazing doc about the ever-fascinating cartel violence) and the Tamil tigers in another episode. Great Channel Excellent Docs. Whoever mentioned exit through the gift shop, thats a really good one about banksy. Through a blue lens is dated, but good.<br />Regards,<br />Nash

				Through the Wormhole - It&#039;s a series on science channel narrated by Morgan Freeman but it&#039;s easy to find online. Discusses theoretical physics stuff like: time travel, parallel universes, dark matter to name a few.<br /><br />Also, the Quantum Activist is a really good watch, highly recommend it. <br /><br />For some crazy stuff that should definitely be taken with a grain of salt &quot;What the Bleep do we know?&quot; regardless there are some really cool theories in there that get the brain juices flowing
