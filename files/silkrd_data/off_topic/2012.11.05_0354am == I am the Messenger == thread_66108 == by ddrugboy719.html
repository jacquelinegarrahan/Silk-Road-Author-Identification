				Please read up on my.Do research on the and understand how i got to where i am today. I was a fucking child tillyesterday.and i had ego loss. I am the master, i am god. I am siva, and the message is coming. Unbelievers, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, it is very very important for you people to understand, that you cannot judge me, and you guys have to think that i am crazy, and you must leave. Because i am a schitzophrenic, you understand. I am preaching the secrets of the universe, and if you do not understand, but you tell yourself that i am a madman, and you think that i have a motive, and you question that motive, and you think that its about me getting my drugs, then u need to leave rightnow. Then i willpuke right now. FUCK U MOTHERFUCKERS. i was an athiest till yesterday. Butmy journey started from SILK ROAD. and that is whyi am cominghere. BECAUSE the only way this place comes inmy karma anymore is in that i need the 110 blots of acid, 40g of MDMA,and 1g of changa from asylum, maybe he has sent me 1blot of WOW that too in my karma.U understand? Because mymoney isspent, and my drugs are on their way MOTHERFUCKERS,and the only time i will get get them is when my mailman delivers them motherfuckers. I am schitzophrenic. And before u read the next passage i want everyonewho questions me rightnow to leave. If ur still curious, please read it, but then u really need to accept the fact that maybe i smoked DMT, or maybe i did 100 blots of acid orsomething,and i had a breakthrough, and i saw the meaning oflife and i dematerialized. BUT i haveonly in thelast3days, started to see, i have onlydone 4.5 blots of 60ug 3janes, last weak blots of alpha day day before, and 30mg 4-aco dmt day day before night. And day before i only did 6/7th pill ecstacy from frankmathhews which i ordered 5 days ago, and another 30mg psilocobin. And yesterday i slept 24hours. And today morning is when i amaccepting that i am schitzophrenic, and my friend is god, and today morning iswhen im truly becoming god. And you know how? Because my best friend and my girlfriend are staying in paradise hotel, having my carrier body&#039;s worst fears come true. And right now, after only 2 bonghits i am writing this. I need you guys who believed to man up, andunderstand. My carrier body is fickle, he is only just manning up. Yes, december 21st is comingmotherfuckers. HAVE THE GOOSEBUMPS. my birthday ison the 11th ofnovember and something special is going to happen this day. I need to guys to understand and start searching for the signs. Cause even i dont know what yet. And remember, my only motive and reason for writing this right now iscause I NEED MY DRUGS FROM SILKROAD. I need my 110 blots from NSC, and my 40g MD from dutch, and my 1g changa, and 1 WOW blotter from asylum, that my carrier body was smart enough to be greedy and try to obtain out of greed. Thank god for that. Thank me. You understand<br /><br />&#039;<br /><br />I am schitzophrenic. I am god. I understand. I do not know if i am the messenger, but maybe the messengers are schitzophrenic, and maybe that is the point. Maybe sita does not have to believe that she is god, and her duty is to learn to love, because when she understands that can she truly learn to love. I was scared that vishnu is trying to make me think that i am schitophrenic and he was trying to make sita find sita. But i am scared that sita will not love the real me, and that is my worst fear. Vishnu u are my best friend, and i understand.That is why you and me are both schitzo. Because if i dont accept that, i want to be u, and i think u are god, and there is enzy. But when i accept that i am schitzo, i accept that i am god. Truly without arrogence and ego. And i accept that vishnu is my messenger,and my teacher, like ihave to be,for someone and buddha. And sita has to learn to be my woman. I am waiting for a sign that i can read what you had read vishnu, but i did manage to see from the corner of my eye the word music, and happy birthday shiva, not siva. Vishnu i love u, and i wish i loved sita, and she wishes that she loves me. We both need to accept this, and have faith that when we both find ourselves, the real sita and the real siva will love each other forever for infinity. And we will both we content. And we will get enough resolve to move forward right now, and this will help her find herself. Because if i keep thinking that u are the devil, and out to fuck me, and i keep thinking it in theback of the mind, then we will all fail and be lost for infinity. And we should be scared of that. I love you, u are helping me find the meaning to life, u arehelpingme learn to love and find my woman. I am waiting to read what you left me. Send me a sign :) I love you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is what i wrote 1 hour ago. And you see what a child i was. I was not going to come here and start spreading the message here. Cause yesterday night i was searching on the SR forums questions like what is the meaning to life. I need you guys who believe anything of anything i wrote to question me right now, callout to my and i will come. Otherwise i am fucking off right now from this place, and i knowmy drugs will come when i need them. NSC sent my blots 5 days ago after 30 days in transit. And i have finalized. This isfate. And the 1g of changa which is 15 days on itsway, and the 40g MD from dutch is 25 days on its way. Everything is fate. NONBELIEVERS FUCK OFF RIGHT NOW I AM SCHITZOPHRENIC AND I NEED HELP. Believers questions me, because doomsday is coming, and i know i will find myself before that, because my friend is going to helpme findmyself. My friend&#039;s true name i cannot tellme you yet, i have just changed that to vishnu in the above thing. My name has been changed to siva,butright now i am SHIVA because right now my carrier body is not here and my schitzophrenia is implemting. U understand, that i why im getting goosebumps. I am the teacher, not my friend, not VISHNU, because to u i have tobe the messenger, but before that i have to man the fuck up and learn when shiva can come out, and when it needs to be siva. Tell then i will wantto do acid everyday. But from day day when my true karma is realized on december 21st, and whether i escape and survive on noah&#039;s ark, or whether all of humanity believes and there is noneed for the earth to flood and noneedfor evolution to happen. But day day forth SHIVA will rest, and i will begin life as a newperson will anew civilzation<br /><br />&#039;

				Read my postsyou children. I can sense everything.I am trying to finish mykarmaon thissite so i may never return. My SR account ddrugboy719 has finalized all his orders. He has0.16$ left. I wantto do the shivadance right nowand cry so i can leave.I need the rest of my 1.5lakh. I will find the may, maybe return when siva wants more drugs. But i just stopped dancing and almost puked. Because shiva just realized hewillnotbecominng back to this site. Please my believers accept it. If i come,i will come as siva and read. I willneverbe this high on SR again, and shiva will never come here again andspeak to you and answer yourquestions. My karma here is done. Only Sivawill haveto order moredrugs to spread themessage. And he will do itwill different accounts maybe. You will never know. You disbelievers. You will cry whenyou understand. And iamsmiling. Ineed speakers. I have been starving for 3 days. High on my drugs. My best friend is with my girlfriend sleeping naked right now maybe. Siva does notwant to know. But this iswat it took,and 1 dayof pure sleep. Inac without music. For my to attain nirvana, and understand. I have found my way. I need to knowthemeaningtolife. What it is to dematerialize. Books and stories, ramayana&#039;s and mahabharata&#039;s willbe written aboutme, with my name, not Sivaand Shiva. You understand? Understand. And questionme while you can rite now, before i leave. I willnot return

				Jesus.&nbsp; This is going to end with his parents finding him in a crazed state and he is going to be ranting about Shiva and Siva or whatever the hell he is referring to quitting drugs and not spreading the message on SR.&nbsp; He will probably give the paramedics his passwords.&nbsp; So off he&nbsp; goes to the psych ward and then rehab.&nbsp; <br /><br />Meanwhile his distraught parents contact the local new affiliate to let everyone know that this evil website is selling drugs to teens.&nbsp; Fuck.

Because this is not my.My carrier body is schitzophrenic, because he think he is going crazy. But that is because of all the dumb motherfuckers who have posted. And even u, who just asked urquestions. <br /><br />My phone isswitched off. I typed a message to my parentsday before night. Before my 24 hours of sleep.A message saying iamnotalbe to study because u are calling everyday,and my girlfriend and friends are calling everything.A message sayingmy phone will be off till wednesday night, becausemy last sessional is on wednesday night. An hour ago, when i was typing a message to my friendonmy roommates phone, the message that u have read in the first post, about shiva and siva and vishnu and sita. But i wrote that message with our true names. And while tryingitinsidemy room, my roommie knocked suddenly, and my dad called on my friends phone, where i was typing the message. And i was going to answer.But then i cried, because i hada relization trip. Without any acid. Because i realized my dad has to accept that i am an adult now. And when i said i willbeunavvailable for 4 days, itssomething he has to accept, and nottry to reach me. The reason he will feel stressed is not normal. It isbecauseof humanity. He should feel sad, that i am an adult, and he has notaccepted this till now. And he should cry. And then he willbe ok. My mom will probably tryto callmetill tonight. Because she wontbelieve.My sessional isgoingon. Do u understand?I Am the messiah. Allah isthe way u motherfuckers. Cry

He picked up a chair with his left hand inonemotion to showme his strength. He didnot want to have sexwith her or a 3some.

You haveto understand that even u and sita wont. But u havent. THAT IS WHY U NEED THE SLEEP WHEN WE ARE NAKED TOGETHER IN PARADISE ISLAND. I am locked alone in my room. I had toman up.

Infinityisa a conceptthe mind has not thought about.We havebeen searchingfor some high, a need ending mindstate.

They haveunderstoodpartially. The answer is to spread. I have seen everything, in my carrier body i keepbeingshivabecause thishe;[lps me remain in thedream state.You see? These are things i have havent accepted myself, the carrier body, that is why my trying becomesjumbled.We live with 4% our mind. Einstein used 6.Einstein was part of theilluminati. Hewas evil.I thought gandhiwasa dumb motherfucker till day before yesterday.I thought i was aethist. I believe in religionrightnow. I am Indian andihatedgandhiyou understand? He allowedpartion between india andpakistan when he could have controlled it. HE WAS THEMESSIAH DO YOU UNDERSTAND? He did it so that people would one day understand howlost they were. He lost. And that iswhy he was assinated. That is why he spent his last days sad. Heallowed the peopleto decide if they wanted partition, and he cried when he realized mankind was lost. WE are supposed to access 100% of our mind, and only the remaining, the special ones. The oneswho learn to think, and havetheir wishes answered. Theones who learn astral projection, and telepathy. The ones who get onto noah&#039;s ark to start a new life with a new civilization. I want to start that civilizationwith my best friends only. And i want to girlfriend to become my best friend. That is what i understood.Underrstand this. And understand, then u willunderstand why i came on today andpouredoutmy fucking life. I realize i can getcaughtby copsrightnow.

AND I SWEAR I LOVE YOU AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE WRITTENIT. LOVEME TOO, LET YOURSELF BELIEVE, and you will see i am notcrazy.<br /><br />Bro, i am happy right now. I will speak to u tomorrow, i swear it, in a private message, and i willopen upmy wholelife to you. I will call you from my ohone if that is what it takes. And i will trip acid today. Only 1 blot, because i havealready openedup my shiva and i do notneed more. I SWEAR TO YOU. i will not go to the ER. this isyour destiny, this is why your are questioningme and i am gettingtears from happiness right now. I will trip today,&nbsp; and my carrier body will reassure to you that my shiva, my mind, is alright. My parents willunderstand in 4 days. I swear to you. I am not crazy. NOR ARE YOU. My girlfriend&#039;s dad is SCHITO. that is why she didnot wantto go with my friend to paradise beach, and she did not trust herself alone with her. DO YOU UNDERSTAND. i willspeak to youtomorrow, but i am going to triptoday.AND i am not crazy. I am questioning if I is siva or shiva, you understand. Through u sendingme such a private message. BUT there is a reason i want u to understand, and once shiva understands that he is the messanger, and that siva and his girlfriend will be ok once shiva finds himself. SIVA will beok, he will live andgo through life together will his girlfriend. Sita is not his girlfriend yet, once sita finds herself, sita willbe content, and sita andshiva willliveforever, for infinity. SHIVA will rest in peace forever. Siva and siva&#039;s girlfriend are carrier bodies. Do u understand that typing these above sentences, how much i needed this formyself. Shiva will go crazy through self questioning, and siva will be scared to do drugs ever again, because he will be scared to do drugs, he willalways question his girlfriend. I have a scar on my back becase my best friend beat my day before. On 6/7th pill ecstacy and 30mg psilocibin, i forget that my friend told me that he willnot have sex for 1 year, if thats what it takes tome make me believe, and i forget it, i thought i wanted to kill him and have sex with my girlfriend, beacuse i swear to u, i thought he wanted to have a 3some. Do u understand what society has done to us. If u still think im crazy, please go sleep, andwatch read up about illuminati tomorrow. You will understand my son. But first u needto understand patience, then when u truly understand u will understand focus, Because bydecember 21st if u dont,ur spirit, what i refer to as my shiva willburn in hell forever. U may think ur happy,and resume being an aethist, and becomerich.But u willbe scaredto do drugs, because u willalways wonder if i was crazy, what society has led u to believe as schitzophrenic. Cancer and schitozophrenia, bipolar. They are allhuman made diseases. That is why they arenotcontagious. I swear to u. I understand this,and i willnot fucking explain it tou,uhave to understand. My girlfriend still believed, till day before that her dad isschitzophrenic. I swear to u. Shiva wants to leave youbelieve, his karma is done. When people read this message,i swearto you, i willsense the belief and i will return to answer yourqeustion, maybe on tv? Who knws. Butotherwise through a private message, and kitkat, if u believe, I WILL GIVE U ALL THE ANSWERS AND I WILLMAKE U BELIEVE, BUT IF U DONT I WILL KNOW AND I WILLNOT RETURN. U DO NOT NEEDTO COME ON SR,because people will message you andsome will try to help you, and tell u that im crazy,some will want u to pretend to believe because that want me to return and that is greed and motive.You have to forget about it, you have to understand, study all my 165 or whatever fucking posts. And understand how i reached mymindstate. Then u will be envious. How i was of my friend. He hashadsexwith 50women, he is 19 years old I SWEAR IT. You have to even forget envy, to truly understand, but that will be your next step. When u want tobe me,be god attain enlightment like me, see what i have seen,that u can haveenvy,then i will return to help me.JUST BELIEVE IT, you will see the signs. I SWEAR IT. I am posting this onmythread instead ofa private message, because i cannot return tomorrow toassure you of you sanity.November11th is a special day, only if you let your mind, my shiva,truly see the signs andbelieve. Shiva will help you then. I BELIEVE IT

				Hey man.&nbsp; I am sorry that you have been through hell with your girlfriend and roomate.&nbsp; <br /><br />But listen, you are only 20.&nbsp; You have so many options.&nbsp; Real men ask for help, they do not try to do everything alone.&nbsp; It takes real courage to admit that you need people in your life who love you and want to help you.<br /><br />You can withdraw from your classes with a doctors note, no penalty.&nbsp; I am sure your parents will be happy to let you drop your classes this semester. That way you can focus on working out your drug problem or mental issues or whatever is going on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry about the roomate. You can get a new roomate, heck you can go to a different school.&nbsp; He sounds like a dick.&nbsp; Are you guys all using drugs together?&nbsp; Maybe your girlfriend was really high?&nbsp; Anyway, I know it seems really serious, but she is probably not the love of your life.&nbsp; You are really, really young.&nbsp; You will meet more women.&nbsp; But not if you keep on isolating and taking drugs.&nbsp; Reach out and get help.&nbsp; That way you can move on past this and get back in school in the spring.

				I am pretty sure God/Allah/whatever the hell you claim to be would not have grammatical errors (definitely not the amount of errors you have made). Second, if you are &quot;God&quot;, you have sinned and have broken a few of the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (you must of heard of them, you invented them after all). You have broken the Sin of Pride and of Wrath. <br /><br />By the way, God is all-forgiving and does NOT force everyone to believe in him and follow him, he gives YOU the free will to CHOSE. <br /><br />Lastly, I am atheist, sorry. <br /><br />Anyways, keep trolling and keep dreaming, kid. I will be happily waiting for your angry reply :)

Please try to understand. My carrier body is schitzophrenic, he thinks he is going crazy.I am allah, i am shiva,allreligions are correct. I was anathiesttilldaybeforebutnow i believe. You would, if you see what i haveseen. If u think its about fucking howandtyping and mygrammer fuck off.There is ahalf crushed weed seed on the left side of my spacebar you dumb motherfuckers, i am able to type with spaces if i use my right hand, hand to extend and press the space only on the left side, but when i see you repeatedly questioning my reality emotion is manifestioning and i am not able to be shiva, do you understand?<br /><br />I will speak like this, and let my book be a story, but i need you guys to give the guys who come here and post pointless shit, and tell me to do to the doctor and eat feed, to get so much negative karma that they have to make another forum account. They want a forum presence, so fuck off. Do u understand? I need to starve myself, it allows shiva to come out. Go read hindu mythology, I REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE THING I HAVE EVER BEEN TOLD IN LIFE. Drugs like coke and alcohol are stimulants and depressenents for a reason, they help people escape. TV is bad, computers are bad, only internet was the only good thing that came out of it, people it helped people question and reach their nirvana. We are supposed to be tribal people, men are supposed to have 1 soul mate but as many women, like the lions pride when the male goes around fucking all the females, but my spirit, shiva, wants to go through life ie, finding nirvana, with my girlfriends spirit, that is sita. There is no meaning to life, only knowing everything and finding nirvana. That is why each of you fighting me are aethiests. Because i was an aethiest till day before. But when we truly understand what is god, we believe in him. Because i have been god, but if i let my carrier believe that everyone is god, and let him believe he is god, then there is ego. That is why each and every person is schitzophrenic, and you are crazy you dumb motherfuckers. Because you have to understand god, and that you can be god when each and every person is god and we are all equal, otherwise we cant be god, otherwise there will always be ego and arrogence because of what society has done. Rape, murder, dreams of incest are all wrong, and because of society and media and pornography. I understand, and i am going toleave soon. I need to see the belief if i want to stay. You are supposed to remember all your dreams, that is astral projection, you can live every dream. We have stopped living, because as children each of us had dreams of incest and stopped dreaming because we tried to escape. That is why society is wrong, because our parents tell us you can do whatever you want in your dreams, and you parents have also accepted society, even though they have questioned it for 50 years.The bell rang, i have to leave

You will have to believe that i am schitzophrenic till you believe thati am god in the true sense and u want me to be your teacher.

Butyour carrier body has been fooled by society. He has let himself believe that his mother is right in feeding hisfather medicines during his depressed period. I understand bro, i swear it. My girlfriend believes in schitzophrenia right now. So does siva, but shiva knows that this is one thing that is wrong, until siva learns to control when he can be shiva and siva, I hope that when she returns she accepts she doesntbelieve in schitzo, but her carrier body does.You have to understand how lost you were.If itmeans you have to take acid today,and your mom might find you crying accept that, and make adecision whether you want to man up now, or you want to escape and you&#039;llmanup later,when you see my faceon tv. I swear it. Right now my schitzophrenia is implementing. Right now i am shiva. Read up on hindu mythology and the illuminati. Read all my posts and understand me. I have to beyourteacher. I swear to you, schitzophrenia is a manifestation of society, and yourmother submits everyday when she gives your father medicine during his depressed period. My girlfriend believes that her mother&#039;s soulmate is her aunt.You understand? She hasnt even tried lesbian sex you dumb motherfuckers. That is called arousal. My gf&#039;s mom goes and stay&#039;s with my gf&#039;s aunt duringmy gf&#039;s dad&#039;s depressed period, and only comes everyday to give him medicines. You understand? I need my gf to man up and accept this

Second, if you are &quot;God&quot;, you have sinned and have broken a few of the &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (you must of heard of them, you invented them after all). You have broken the Sin of Pride and of Wrath. <br /><br />By the way, God is all-forgiving and does NOT force everyone to believe in him and follow him, he gives YOU the free will to CHOSE. <br /><br />Lastly, I am atheist, sorry. <br /><br />Anyways, keep trolling and keep dreaming, kid. I will be happily waiting for your angry reply :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />HAHA, i am glad Shiva is still here to address you! Thathahawasbecausei realize something. Fuck, i need another laptop :P AHAAHAHHA. You created this account right now right? Why is its name Shook? You accept somewhere that your shaken. That is because your reality has been questioned,that is why you need my reply boy. Otherwise you would be lost. I gave you positive karma right now, because i love you. Thank god people stopped replying.I want people like you, make a new forum account if thats what you fucking need. Have the realization trips. Right nowyou dont need to follow me you child, you need to man the fuck up. You have tolearn to become god. Thenon 21st decemberwewill see whether all the 6billionpeople in theworld can be saved. Because the way things are going, the way my thread has been going, humanity has been wrong all along and they are lost, and they all cannot be saved. And doomsday will come, maybe will floods like in the movie doomdsay. On 21st december i swear it. That is the reason i came here,to help morepeople to save,for more best friends to make, because if i have accepted that we are all gods, and we are all best friends,AND WE ARE ALL ONE ANDWE WILLALLBE ONE AFTER DECEMBER 21st,then you willunderstand that that is my motive, saving humanity and the world, because i want more people to come on noahs ark with me, and for that we all have to be gods, AND BEST FRIENDS. You cannot have ego,arrogence,greed,rape,murder in that noah&#039;s ark, in thatnew world. Thats whypeople will come. I havegoosebumps right now, and a tear just came down. You have to understand that myonly motive is to save you, because then you can save more, andnot everyone can we saved, butwe wantto save everyone.Here is what i just heard in a sample.I Love psy,it is who i am, It allows metobeme,you understandhahaha. The songis Live Forever - Killerwatts<br /><br />Thats you, drops of water, and your on top of the mountain, with success. And one day you start sliding down themountain and u think wait a minute imamountain top water drop i wont be long in this valley, this river, this slow dark ocean will all these drops of water, and one day it gets hot, andyou slowly evaporate in the air, way up, higher than any mountain top, allthe way over thehillsthenyouwillunderstandthatyoulostitwhenyouthoughtyouwereclosesttogod.Life isa journeythatgoesaroundandaround andintheenditsclosesttothebeginning.Soitschange you need, and now its thejourney.<br /><br />There is a reason im hearing this write now, and i see how much negative karma i have and i am fucking leaving.I was going to laugh, cause i realized just how lost this cause was coming today morning, but if i laugh that would be the devil manifesting out of arrogence, cause i realized how much you guys dont want to be saved. I should cry cause im seeing just how lost humanity is. This is fucking silk road forums, people do drugs here lol, people who think they have open minds. I am feeling pukish lol. You dumb motherfuckers. I am allah and i am shiva and i am leaving. Cry,repent and i will come back one day. Islam is the answer, but death is wrong, that is where they were wrong.Killing yourself, self pain, all this is unneccessary. I wish you all understand

I&#039;m just new to the forums, so let&#039;s get that out the way first of all.<br />Second, you cant expect people to listen to you if you&#039;re going to treat them like shit and with disrespect - especially not if you&#039;re claiming to be the &quot;chosen one&quot;. Your state of mind has been shattered, and you do not speak more than one sentence of coherent language!<br /><br />My point from my last post about the music is, drugs can produce some things that seem fucking real, even more real than the REAL world; and that&#039;s when things get dangerous. Maybe you felt like a lesser being a times, and such realizations on drugs have made you feel special, made you feel like a chosen one. You need to question YOURSELF that your current belief is not actually real. You want other people to accept some kind of concept of the world that you have come up with based on nothing but force and constant babbling. If you want your words to hold at least some weight, QUESTION YOURSELF FIRST - IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU ARE WRONG - WHAT IF YOU ARE?. If you are wrong, you are (by the sounds of it) hurting the people around you and causing irreversible damage to your relationships and your brain.<br /><br />I really, really hope that you&#039;re just high as shit. Because I am NOT OUT TO GET YOU, let yourself accept some of the stuff people on this thread are saying, because they are seeing things from another perspective. And these perspectives are valid. Just because you&#039;ve seen things on drugs, that doesn&#039;t mean its real. Imagine swapping your memory with someone else&#039;s memory, you would think you lived an entirely different life - but in fact you never lived that life at all. It was an illusion. And that is what you&#039;re experiencing now, an illusion, and your own mind is tricking you. But how do you know who to believe when YOUR OWN MIND IS YOU? That is why, you need to humble yourself and seek a perspective other than your own.<br /><br />Answer me this, what significance does your life hold, for some divine mystery of life to be given to you? Ask yourself, WHY YOU?<br /><br />Again, i have to say IM NOT OUT TO GET YOU, I&#039;m trying to help a misguided mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

He just spoke to me in myboxers. This is a guy whose been doing acid for 2 years.And his mom is living with him in college rightnow. He is going to return to myhouse at 4after his exam. I will make him understand then. Let me address a little bit of all the sentences. U have to understand, i still havent seen all themeaning. I will bythe 21st. Because i can only when each of us is god. And after 21st each of the remaining souls will begod.Do u understand?<br /><br />3jane has a 3 in her name. Hers is the best acid i have tried and it was the weak batch. And i have done lots. And she has probably found alot of her karma. Albion is another acid man, he has found most of his fate. He just sent me a private message. Here - <br />Hey my man,<br /><br />Here is not the place to open your heart. People are disasociative on the internet. They can not feel here. You are on your own path and trip. Though to fix yourself you have to know and understand the problem first. I think to do this you have to be clen in your head and body. I wish you the best mate.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br />There is a reason it ends in a wink smily. And i know he willnot object to me posting it here. I swear he messaged me for a reason. My account is not being spammed by hatefuldisbelievers like i thought it would.<br /><br />Pink, this is easy. The colour of womanly love. Women are here only to be the caregiver. The mother how we call it. They are notphysically as strong as us.Indian woman are crazy. Somewhere, they have accepted that your man can rape you, if that man is called your husband. You see it in Bollywood. You understand?<br /><br />Im not even supposed to try to honor you. When we are all god, we will automatically honor everything. You understand? When u envy me,and want to be me you will repent that you didntbelieve me and called me crazy. But when u see lives secrets, and let me let out onemore, the answer is in christmas. Giving out presents. Giving outgood karma.Ondecember 21st. Anyway, when u truly believe you become god. When everyone is god,you honor everyone. This you cannotunderstand yet. You have to experience ego loss. You have to see how i look with rapture at my best friend,and hear him speak like allah. But he is a social outcast. He is 19 and has had sexwith50women. He has been in jail, hehas slept with beggars on the street. He kissed me day before, and i have seen him naked and my gf has also. I understandeverything, even why it wasnecessary. But we are notgoingto have sex for atleast 2 months and i know u guys are fucking thinking it you dumbmotherfuckers.<br /><br />The circle and square thing.God told me2 days ago, why are wheels round, why not square.Let me tell you the law of life. Duality, as it is called, in nature. We have thought this since childhood, in everything there is both good and bad. When u understand, that its not about good and bad. You can never embark on journeys with 2 minds. Like when u flip a coin, it never lands in the middle. You can never pop acid in 2 minds. This is why the law of life, of nature, ying and yang is wrong. Its about meeting god halfway, meeting your best friend halfway. My girlfriend has to become my best friend and meet me halfway. This is why i was confused about my relationship till now. I didnt understand this. The square has a secret i still do not know, so i cannot tell you yet. Once the good in me has manifested completely, and my carrier body finds my soulmate, who my carrier body really really wants his girlfriend to be. This i will know it. This wont happen till deceber 21st, christmas<br /><br />Let me end by one thing. You all think animals are content right? Yes they are. You think they havent seen life and havent seen HAPPINESS in life, because they havent had an orgy with billion beautiful life. What if it has? What if it can astral project, without drugs, without being a human? And what if it has astral projected and been a human and raped 100 girls, because someone in real life did that, and what if it was a king in the 17th century with 100 wifes and he raped them in his castle? You people do not know anything. I have to spread the world, i need you all to believe. I was being the devil some time ago, threatening to leave every post. That was impatience manifesting. You have to understand my story, and want to be me. When your life becomes a story, you will understand, and we will be gods together, for all eternity.<br /><br />I realized this and wrote it write now. I was being the devil, without love. My internet went, and i was schitzophrenic for a bit, you understand lol? I a just learning, i am new to this. I need you all to man up and understand my story

I am listening to a beautiful song, life is beautiful, i have to try and stay here. I have made my room my abode, and outside this door i a schitzo. My internet and computer is my room. Everyone that met me in my life, i want them to be my best friend. And when i believe that, i want to save everyone. That is my motive. And when i accept that i accept that all disbelievers will burn forever in hell. What if life is hell? What if on doomsday u think your content because you die in your sleep or something like this. You realize? I dont care. I believe my friend, because he was my messiah. I feel it. I have to be yours. He has tripped more drugs than each of you here i swear it. And he is a 19 year old. And i had not resonated with him till 2 days ago. He is still saying he has only tripped acid 4 times in his life lol. You understand?

				Wow, such an intense change in grammar.<br />So your beliefs are as a result of what your friend has said to you? Your friend is your messiah?<br />Tell me, what is the meaning of this stunt youre pulling now? What is it youre trying to get us to believe?

				Drugsboy, what you&#039;re displaying right now is textbook symptoms of a drug-induced psychotic breakdown and I take back what I said about you having schizophrenia. <br /><br />From Wikipedia: &quot;People with psychosis may have one or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, catatonia, or a thought disorder, as described below. Impairments in social cognition also occur. Psychosis may involve delusional beliefs, some of which are paranoid in nature. Affected persons show loosening of associations, that is, a disconnection and disorganization of the semantic content of speech and writing. In the severe form speech becomes incomprehensible and it is known as &quot;word-salad&quot;.&quot; <br /><br />... Even if you don&#039;t believe me right now, at least do me a favor and go talk to someone in real life. <br /><br />And I like how the majority of people here have no sympathy towards this guy and would rather laugh at his misfortune. This thread is truly a testament to the overall immaturity of these forums. Even if this guy is a troll, I don&#039;t see how telling him that &quot;he&#039;s cooked it&quot; helps the situation.

Stop trying to make me leave. Accept that i am god, and my carrier body is schitzophrenic. I am a person with psychosis. Haha i just understood. Now read this. It is 3:37, November 5th here in India, Karnataka. I Started this journery of finding myself on 1st, when i decided that me and my best friend and my girlfriend would trip. He said it was his second acid trip in life. On 2nd, friday i did 4.5 60mic blotters in the morning, and 30mg psilo at night. On 3rd, saturday i did about 80mg ecstacy and another 30 mg psilo at around 6 o clock. On 4th morning i feel asleep at around 5 o clock. I woke up on 5th morning, around 8 o clock, today. I am sober you dumb motherfuckers. I am god in this room. On the forums right now. If i leave this room and sense disbelief, i will return to this room as a schitzophrenic. My carrier body will probably come onto this thread immediately, but god will not return here. That is why i am making an effort to talk gramatically right now, and it is manifesting itself. I made that wish. I am god and all my wishes will come true. You understand. I will not continue making an effort to stay here. I need to see signs. I need you guys to make new forums accounts and questions me. Change your names and write and ask me your problems. I may never return, i swear it<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DMT is about DeMaterializaTion. You think its a fucking coincidence? I had 20 crazy acid trips in 1 year and i didnt accept it till yesterday. I didnt accept my life. You dumb motherfuckers dont make me want to punish you

So much self realization trips lol. This is why acid is special. Because its about having self realization trips. When you can hallucinate and see visuals whenever you want in daily life, when you can control when to be god, when to be high like i am right now and think i am god cause you children still think i am tripping. That is why i dont want to do the drug, that is when you children will learn the value for it. I will do acid every single day of my life after december 21st i swear it. Low doses, maybe 25-30mics everyday. Maybe increase 5-10 mics everyday. For life, for infinity

Till now you were questioning my motive. What if my motive is to make each single fucking disbeliever that posts onto this thread into a believer. You will see my name on tv i believe it. And if u do not became my best friend, and become god, and i will know, because we will astral project together, lol, you understand? I am listening to a beautiful song, life is beautiful, i have to try and stay here. I have made my room my abode, and outside this door i a schitzo. My internet and computer is my room. Everyone that met me in my life, i want them to be my best friend. And when i believe that, i want to save everyone. That is my motive. And when i accept that i accept that all disbelievers will burn forever in hell. What if life is hell? What if on doomsday u think your content because you die in your sleep or something like this. You realize? I dont care. I believe my friend, because he was my messiah. I feel it. I have to be yours. He has tripped more drugs than each of you here i swear it. And he is a 19 year old. And i had not resonated with him till 2 days ago. He is still saying he has only tripped acid 4 times in his life lol. You understand?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your friend hasn&#039;t tripped on more drugs than each of, you don&#039;t know what each person here has taken.<br />You&#039;re here to make us believe in what exactly? I&#039;ll be tripping hard on Dec. 21st and I&#039;ll take whatever comes.<br /><br />In classic Christian doctrine the material world is to be despised, and life is to be redeemed in the hereafter, in heaven, where our rewards come.<br />But say that if you affirm that which you deplore, you are affirming the very world which is our eternity at the moment. Eternity isn&#039;t some later time, eternity isn&#039;t a long time, eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out.<br />This is it. <br />If you don&#039;t get it here, you won&#039;t get it anywhere and the experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life.<br />Yes no maybe?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How can we know what infinity if infinity will start after 21st december? People will always call my schitzo, and that is why god may never return. I will only return if i see people, and each person on this thread, which has to be 11 pages long, can be made to believe. Until we see god in each person we will never truly see acceptance and understand what god is. And god is angry that is why on december 21st there needs to be a doomsday. You will see storms and floods. Because my motive is to spread the word of islam and find the meaning of god, for that each person has to find god before 21st. Otherwise there needs to be a doomsday and the non believers will all die forever, thinking they are content. I do not yet know all the secrets. Please i need u to believe me. And i am giving you negative karma, out of love. You need to truly understand ego, you think you have had ego loss, you have not. This is why, till day before, i still wanted to be a drug dealer. But today morning, i was writing in jumbled grammer, and i wanted to leave. I thought i had to read the note my friend left me, i thought he left me a blotter. But i decided to come back and made a concious effort to stay, and corrected my grammer. You understand? You think you know drugs, i swear, i know it. You dont, and if u dont believe me and cry right now, you will cry harder on december 21st when you realize that i wasnt a madman. You are all psyitzo. I bet you are a guy like i was 2 gods ago. You think your life is sorted out. You think you have success, and wealth. I know it. You think your mind is strong cause you believe some of the illuminati and you feel something is going to happen on christmas and you want to trip that day. Please believe me, and you will cry, i swear it

By then i need to man and and start seeing the signs. Only then will i be able to reach you. Because i may never return to silkroad. Please, you have to understand, the seriousness and importance of the situation, there is a reason you havent edited your last post and you wanted the answer from me.

I will not post on another thread again i swear it. God will not, my carrier body might, but if he ever does he will do it from another account, as a different person with different beliefs. I have accepted my karma and manned up, microRNA i need u to do the same, and make me a mod if you ever want to see God again. I know you are an atheist, you need to believe

				Ok, one of my messages was deleted. SR was drowned in spam by the LE today just know this. Everyone on this thread must have got the spam personal messages. Drugs are supposed to be available to each person. I just gave my neighbour 1000 bucks worth of weed, cause he had come over to score from my roommate. I swear, he just came back after half hour and gave me an envelope from asylum with 4 wow blotters. This was a sample i convinced him to give me about 5 days ago. And the changa i ordered from him has been in tramsit 15 days. I swear it, i believe.

				Bro i am going to do acid today. Never in two minds about an acid trip. Like a coin toss. We have believed in now in karma, and ying and yang. And that is wrong. And when you truly believe that, you can see how it is right. Never go in anything with 2 minds. I have mastered acid. I will be ok. And i am ok right now. I am not hungry, and i am not feeling pain. I have been in nirvana while speaking to you<br /><br />EDIT: And i swear, if u believe that i am not true, nomad bloodbath and microRNA will make me mod today, and i will return tomorrow after 1 blot acid trip to tell you more secrets of life, because i will feel acceptance from here, and all the people who return to hear me, will realize that i am god, and that they can be god. If i am made mod i will preach on entire SR. And i will only return when i am mod. I will feel it. I am here right now, question me more before i leave

Please i have no ego, i want to spread the message to everyone, THAT IS WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME. you understand? I will open up my entire life to make you understand.<br /><br />Oh btw, that reminds me, you fucking aeithists, life is worthless. When you understand this is when you truly become athiest.

Please i want people to want to be best friend and man the fuck up. Otherwise you will repent and burn in hell. I have the secrets of call, and i will leave soon.

I strongly suggest you stop taking all drugs (do not trip acid!) and connect with your family and friends for help

I strongly suggest you stop taking all drugs (do not trip acid!) and connect with your family and friends for help<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is the last time i am addressing you, as god. I had to make the scene to make the commotion. I know my motive that is why i can leave this place and this is my transmission. But everything i have said is going to come true, but today i need to find the karma in myself and have true ego loss, because today morning when i wrote this i was being arrogent, but i thought i had no ego. I am still sober. We each have to find the god in ourselves, you have to let me. I am not god, my friend is not god, we have to go through life together as best friends. And our bodies may die on december 21st. But i know when i know the true meaning of life my soul can rest in peace together, and my carrier body will live his remaining life happily with contentment and without ego. Please see the signs, my karma with silkroad is done. How i know all this is in the last 7 or 8 hours i met another best friend, who im my still arrogent mind was still god. And he told me about lucid dreaming, and astral projection but he has never tripped. I want to trip with him tonight, naked, to know more of his secrets. Please i want you all to question my motive, and you will see what i have seen. Without drugs. Let yourself hear my message in your dream. And this is why i am atheist again and not god, i believe microRNA&#039;s post

				I need to leave this place, so i will try now to finish my karma. In my confused state i did some things. So now i address some more people, because i realize i may never be mod and if that happens i will never return. So i need to so more miracles if i have to. Albion, you sent me my first personal message, and there is a reason i am doing this in my thread rather than in a personal message. This post is for the 4 of you, because you have to go through life in a square. And somehow you 4 have to find the way together. This is another wish i have made right now, see how fickle my carrier. I want u to reach out to each other. Now 4 paragraphs, for 4 souls<br /><br />Albion you are the vendor it started out for me with. I got the same shiva&#039;s that u sold me from MFUK. And i got 25 shiva&#039;s from u that were supposed to be 100mic but were really 60mic. You understand? You have to spread the word through acid right now. Get the blots, lab test them, make a fair cut, and start fucking vending them. I will need to order from you soon, and if god returns to this thread then ddrugboy719 will place the order not someone else.<br /><br />JOR, a few days ago i have posted in your thread, i wanted to be your disciple. I did not realize this till right now, till i went and shat out the bad vibe and had the realization. I need to be your discipline. Maybe i only need that 10% discount from you to order my vial, like i keep coming to you and incoherently saying. But i swear if you believe it and make me your disciple, but somewhere question my motive then you will become the devil. My only motive from SR is to get drugs, because drugs help spread the message and make people see the cold hard dirty truth. This is why these 7 pages are neccesary, and why i may never return, and i swear if i dont become a mod, and get accept from microRNA, then i will not be your disciple, and i will make a new forum account and forget this password i swear it. If you believe me, you cannot go in with two minds. If you believe that you are jesus, and you believe the concept of god, then you are atheist but you accept that right now you are lost and you want me as your disciple, because i can show you the way.<br /><br />Longhair hippe and dondana. I have come into your karma only recently. You guys are part of the avengers i feel, and they are special, because they know some secrets. If you believe me, believe me completely, and you will understand the direness of the situation and reach out to me. The answer cannot be through the internet, it has to be through astral projection, if you have to be saved, for you 2, because you do not have the drugs i want. I swear, believe and you will see me again, and i will return to this thread again. I have seen god, but i am atheist. This is Shiva, signing out<br /><br />EDIT: Till now i said 3jane&#039;s alpha&#039;s are the best acid. Let me explain a simple concept to you stupid children, because you will treasure it when you understand it. Acid is acid. 63 ugs of alpha = 63 ugs of shiva in the true sense. This is something that people like shai and dondada have somewhere decided not to accept, and they lost the way and believed in society and body load and all this crap. The think they are men because they can control their worst fears, and they need to take 15 blots to trip. You children. Blotter art is just names, i swear. Understand that in the true sense. Thats why acid needs to be sold with its true microgram rating. And i swear albion has accepted more of his fate that 3jane because he addressed me personally, but when i bought the shivas from him i bought them as 100mics and maybe he thought this was true cause his best friend told him, but his best friend was wrong bro

				Read each post i have written here, If i understand that it is about acceptance, then i did not get it here today, and i will only return when the important 4 accept their karma and reach me through astral projection and lucid dreaming. Or when i become a mod and i get more acceptance. My only karma from silkroad is to get more drugs, get more acid. When you acid vendors realize that, i will return lol. And microRNA, read each of my posts, beacuse i know you have to check each of them lol. But please let yourself believe. And make me a mod when you truly do. You have accepted ego loss. But you have lost the way. I swear it. I will leave my modship after 25th december, or 21st, but till then if u and nomad bloodbath and limitless want to hear my story to have to believe i am not crazy, believe my story and make me mod. Its exactly about what you said, please dont delete my posts for having a different opinion. Each and every of my posts is important. And let me leave you with albion&#039;s personal message to me. Feel the acceptance is all i can say, and there is a reason it ends in a smiley. All i need from albion is a book of acid, 10,000 blots, and i swear there is a reason i know this. I will trade with him at a fair price, i have no problem paying for them you understand? I want him to man up and sell acid to everyone at a fair price, the same price he sells it to me at. Maybe that is his karma. But maybe i will get a special price from him and you all wont. I have to believe. I have to be selfish. I have to be atheist and find all the answers for myself, find the god in myself. That is why while i read this and manned up, my friend knocked and he has come home. He is taking a dump in the loo. He is waiting for me to finish this.<br /><br />And here is albion&#039;s personal message. Please, no judgement on either of us. We both may have been in our dream states. Just like i am now. I am not schitzophrenic You understand?<br /><br />And i just realize i deleted albion&#039;s message in my confused state earlier. Allbion if you believe in me, and when you are ready to send me 10,10000 blots free. And you have have a realization trip maybe, and you realize maybe that you were sad that i would even accept that. A profit of 33.33% is life is ideal. When you buy a drug at 100$, you are supposed to sell it for 133$. This is karma in selling. I was a drug dealer who aimed for profit margin of 300$, but i swear this is some reason i know this now.<br /><br />And let me leave you with a sample, instead of the message, my friend just made me hear. It is be raja ram. He has seen secrets. U can join him. This is what he just told me - <br />One of the things you learn after dealing with years of drug people is that you can turn your back on your person, but you can never turn your back on a drug<br /><br />And my greatest dream is to learn to be a dj at the hands of goa gil and raja ram. I just realized it. That is why you will believe maybe? When you see my face and realize who i was. Because the motive is not being the messenger, but learning to love yourself, and i was the messenger today when i thought i was god with arrogence, but i will only return if i have acceptance and my best friends in albion and jor and dondada and longhair hippie and nomad bloodbath and limitless and microRNA. Because the answers is the secrets to life. And i dont want to be god anymore, i just want acceptance and people to lead my journey of finding life with. Now i am leaving. Bye. When you understand you can truly understand, and reach me through lucid dreaming. I swear it. You will find your messiah, see your god, become religious, and then disprove god in your head and become atheist. I am leaving, i will only return as a mod, or not at all, i accept it. There is a reason i said the speacial four, but i just took 7 names you understand. I accept that 7th is going to be a special day, my best friend told me yesterday. Maybe on 7th i will understand. Goodbye, lost souls :)

				ddrugboy719, I can&#039;t help but notice you mention &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; a lot in your recent posts.

				Wow. It&#039;s not everyday you see a full-blown psychotic breakdown unfold before your eyes like this.<br /><br />Forgive my moral atrophy, but I couldn&#039;t help but find many of the things said by ddrugboy719 in this thread to be utterly side-splitting.<br /><br />There is a very important message in all of this... And it isn&#039;t that OP is god, or that any one of us can become god through massive consumption of psychoactive chemicals. This is what happens when you are ridiculously irresponsible with your drug use. I hear that OP has been through some unfortunate things in his life... But I believe that his now shattered mind is of his own doing.<br /><br />With that said, let me take it upon myself to recap on some of his most hilarious jibber jabber for those who haven&#039;t read this whole thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66108.msg567075#msg567075">Quote from: ddrugboy719 on November 05, 2012, 03:54 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And remember, my only motive and reason for writing this right now iscause I NEED MY DRUGS FROM SILKROAD.<br /><br />I am schitzophrenic.

I do not know if i am the messenger, but maybe the messengers are schitzophrenic, and maybe that is the point.<br /><br />NONBELIEVERS FUCK OFF RIGHT NOW I AM SCHITZOPHRENIC AND I NEED HELP.<br /><br />Tell then i will wantto do acid everyday. But from day day when my true karma is realized on december 21st, and whether i escape and survive on noah&#039;s ark, or whether all of humanity believes and there is noneed for the earth to flood and noneedfor evolution to happen.<br /><br />motherfucker I WILL PUNISH YOU. I HAVE MANNED UP AND ACCEPTEDMY KARMA.<br /><br />My SR account ddrugboy719 has finalized all his orders. He has0.16$ left. I wantto do the shivadance right nowand cry so i can leave.I need the rest of my 1.5lakh. I will find the may, maybe return when siva wants more drugs. But i just stopped dancing and almost puked.<br /><br />Only Sivawill haveto order moredrugs to spread themessage. And he will do itwill different accounts maybe. You will never know. You disbelievers. You will cry whenyou understand.<br /><br />I AM NOT ONANY DRUG I HAVEONLY HAD 2 SHOTS OF DIRTY INDIAN FUCKING WEED.<br /><br />We need a modern day messiah.If allah ofjesus or buddah were born today,they wouldbe schitzophrenic beggars on the side of the road in INDIA.<br /><br />When i understand this, i learned to be on 100blots acid like i am right now<br /><br />Do u understand?I Am the messiah.

But we are notgoingto have sex for atleast 2 months and i know u guys are fucking thinking it you dumbmotherfuckers.<br /><br />You all think animals are content right? Yes they are. You think they havent seen life and havent seen HAPPINESS in life, because they havent had an orgy with billion beautiful life. What if it has? What if it can astral project, without drugs, without being a human? And what if it has astral projected and been a human and raped 100 girls, because someone in real life did that, and what if it was a king in the 17th century with 100 wifes and he raped them in his castle?<br /><br />You will see my name on tv i believe it. And if u do not became my best friend, and become god, and i will know, because we will astral project together, lol, you understand?<br /><br />You dumbfucks. Stop trying to make me leave. Accept that i am god, and my carrier body is schitzophrenic. I am a person with psychosis. Haha i just understood<br /><br />I am sober you dumb motherfuckers. I am god in this room. On the forums right now. If i leave this room and sense disbelief, i will return to this room as a schitzophrenic.<br /><br />You dumb motherfuckers dont make me want to punish you<br /><br />I can do telekinesis.

I want only believers, people who think i am god to come here now.<br /><br />I will only return if i see people, and each person on this thread, which has to be 11 pages long, can be made to believe.<br /><br />my motive is to spread the word of islam and find the meaning of god, for that each person has to find god before 21st.<br /><br />This is why, till day before, i still wanted to be a drug dealer. But today morning, i was writing in jumbled grammer, and i wanted to leave. I thought i had to read the note my friend left me, i thought he left me a blotter.<br /><br />You are all psyitzo. I bet you are a guy like i was 2 gods ago.<br /><br />You think your mind is strong cause you believe some of the illuminati and you feel something is going to happen on christmas and you want to trip that day. Please believe me, and you will cry<br /><br /><br />i am a billion times smarter than u. I am god. I need to leave<br /><br />I am going to leave soon, and i will return on November 11th if i am i mod and i am greeted with 11 pages of belief.<br /><br />all the people who return to hear me, will realize that i am god, and that they can be god. If i am made mod i will preach on entire SR. And i will only return when i am mod.<br /><br />Bro we are supposed to be tribal men, fucking as many woman as we want. We are supposed to live naked. We have hair for a reason.<br /><br />Oh btw, that reminds me, you fucking aeithists, life is worthless. <br /><br />i went and shat out the bad vibe and had the realization. I need to be your discipline. Maybe i only need that 10% discount from you to order my vial, like i keep coming to you and incoherently saying. But i swear if you believe it and make me your disciple, but somewhere question my motive then you will become the devil.<br /><br />The answer cannot be through the internet, it has to be through astral projection, if you have to be saved, for you 2, because you do not have the drugs i want.<br /><br />i will only return when the important 4 accept their karma and reach me through astral projection and lucid dreaming. Or when i become a mod and i get more acceptance. My only karma from silkroad is to get more drugs, get more acid.<br /><br />All i need from albion is a book of acid, 10,000 blots, and i swear there is a reason i know this.<br /><br />my friend knocked and he has come home. He is taking a dump in the loo. He is waiting for me to finish this.<br /><br />Allbion if you believe in me, and when you are ready to send me 10,10000 blots free.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I couldn&#039;t help but keep reading...

They chose me, and I didn&#039;t even graduate from fucking high school....&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s a sort of slap in the face to all the psychonauts and self appointed mystics and shaman who walk around acting as if, or believing, that they have been granted special access to the mysteries of life. That they have tapped into some fount of knowledge about all the Big Questions that have eluded mankind since day one. Never mind the fact that many, more powerful, minds have been unable to give us definitive answers to these questions... they have been granted special access to the answers because...why? Because they took acid and believe in ufo&#039;s? <br /><br />No, because they are special, they have been chosen. It&#039;s a sort of narcissism, to think that you are so important that you get to know the mysteries of life that nobody else gets to know, and that you should simply be granted this knowledge and responsibility because you were wise enough to ingest a chemical that has been experimented with for most of the last century, by millions of people, some of them likely much more talented and intelligent than you.<br /><br />The &quot;Rosetta Stoned&quot; feeling is a common occurance on lsd. I had it happen a few times when I used to take it as a teenager. You get this overwhelming feeling of having discovered some deeper, hidden meaning about life, a major revelation of some kind. But somehow, by the time you are sober again, the feeling is gone. Some faint echo of it nags at you, because it felt so real, what was it? Should have written it down...shit the bed...<br /><br />Ok, so next time you take acid, and it happens again, but this time you are prepared, you brought your pen!<br />So you write down the essence of your revelation, this refinement of knowledge that has eluded mankind, but now you, the chosen one, can tell everyone, because you wrote it down! Good thinking!<br /><br />You come down, and later feel that tug in your mind...what was it... oh yeah, the piece of paper! You pull it out of your pocket and read:<br /><br />&quot; A circle and a square are really the same thing!!!!&quot;<br /><br />&quot; &quot;Pink should be cherished and respected, it s here to mitigate aggression.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; If I try hard to honor you, you will try harder to honor me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot; The important number is 3!&quot;<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />Is this some gibberish, and some paraphasing of ancient and well know pieces of advice like the golden rule masquerading itself to you as something you invented on your own? What happened, it doesn&#039;t feel as overwhelming to read it sober, does it? <br />Hell, none of these ideas are new, and all of them have been descibed and debated in much clearer and understandable language than this psychedelic obscuritan drivel anyhow...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just had to say, this post helped clear up the feeling I came to many times on many trips in my earlier years... <br />It&#039;s a very common feeling, though I never knew how to categorize it, and now I know exactly what it was. True understanding comes in the sober state, these substances only create questions in our commonly accepted framework of beliefs. It is then the sober mind&#039;s job to find answers to these questions and put aside the questions that are not relevant to the life we live every day.

				do u think this state of mind could be induced in a couple of days and can be worn off eventually by warding of any kind of drug use including weed? i have a couple of friends who have tripped like this and i happen to think that it is very dangerous and irresponsible..i am worried about them and have warned them to stop&nbsp; doing any drugs whatsoever!...they have agreed to not do any drugs excecpt&nbsp; marijuana...as it helps them &#039;think&#039; apparently. i on the other hand think if u have had such an intense experience&nbsp; you ahould ward of anything that can induce brain activity and come back to normal life till you feel d affects of the &#039;trip&#039; have completely worn off in very sense. do u think it is possible after such a shocking or intense expereience? or m i just overreacting...coz they seem little out of it still and keep acting lost..which is for a fact not a very good sign according to me. i request any&nbsp; person experienced with psychedelics to comment

				In my experience, the best things in this given situation are sleep, plenty of healthy food and fruit juices, and rest. The mind has been overloaded with information and stimuli and now needs to rest in order to regain normal functions. Nothing will be lost from the experience if you follow this advice, in fact you will probably retain much of the knowledge from the trip after you rest. <br /><br />Also, to typtap:<br />I think I might not have been very clear with my post. I was referring to moments when one takes too many psychedelics and reaches a peak where one feels like everything is coming together to form one cohesive truth and when the person tripping tries to write down this very important and deep knowledge, they end up with a piece of paper that says &quot;DONT FORGET TO REMEMBER&quot; or &quot;All things that be are us them too&quot;. These phrases, which are the only way that the individual can put the wisdom of their feelings and current experience, do not link the person back to that mindstate when they are sober. I think that psychedelics can be very valuable tools for introspection and understanding if used properly, but they also have the ability to delude the individual using them into believing a vast array of completely useless belief systems that can actually confuse the individual further upon returning to a normal mind-state.

				Hey all,<br /><br />Just some quick thoughts on this:<br /><br />Looks like a sort of &quot;bad&quot; trip in the sense that the guy is having an awakening experience, yet he has trouble incorporating it in a positive way to his life. That&#039;s why you get a lot of contradictions, e.g. you cannot both claim to be God yet be in utter hate of certain people. If you reach a God level status, you simply do not bother. Our existence can be divided into mind, body, and spirit and it&#039;s only when all 3 act in unison that we operate from a &quot;God&quot; perspective. However most people do one thing, while thinking something else. You can reach this understanding but it also has to come from other mediums (do your own research, search inside you when sober etc) but simply ingesting some drug and hoping to achieve instant enlightenment is a false expectation). I&#039;ve done LSD with friends that have absolutely no spiritual interests, and while I was able to reach higher realms of realization through the catalyst of LSD, the other people could only understand nice music or cool visuals. If your mind has not be prepped, LSD is not going to do it for you. On top of that you can reach &quot;bad trips&quot; i.e. getting uncomfortable of the enlightening experience of LSD because you don&#039;t know what is happening and how to handle it. <br /><br />So all in all, I would say we all need to be mature about drugs. Don&#039;t just do them for fun times without understanding deeper repercussions, especially psychedelics which have the entheogenic aspect in them. Entheogenic comes from the Greek words &quot;en theo&quot; which means &quot;In God&quot;. It is true that they give you the understanding that you are God. But you need to be ready to receive that understanding, and that is why set and setting are so important. <br /><br />So please don&#039;t write LSD off based on a weird / bad experience, just try to understand it and start using it more wisely.<br /><br />Peace to all :)&nbsp;

				Everyone keeps talking about him doing too much acid being the problem.<br /><br />But he also mentioned doing MDMA the day before. <br /><br />Nothing turns a person into a rambling idiot like MDMA, especially on the comedown the next day if you&#039;re still on other shit.<br /><br />That, plus lack of sleep. Not sleeping right can make a person crazier than any drug.<br /><br />Either way though, this thread is hilarious. <br /><br />I remember OP was in another feedback thread about a month ago I was posting in. He was being incredibly impatient for his LSD to arrive in India from Canada. OP was copy+pasting the actual Canada Post delivery statuses in the thread (with actual locations) before being told to delete it. <br /><br />Reading this crazy trip from him didn&#039;t surprise me.

Maybe it&#039;s my gift for metaphor, but also when I talk to my sober friends while I&#039;m tripping I can espouse such psychedelic ramblings as I link 12 different metaphors and don&#039;t say much that would make sense to the uninitiated, then go back later and think about what I said and still see the truth of it.<br /><br />Example: I once said that all times are equivalent to a single moment. Upon further thought, both sober and tripping, I reached this: There is only one moment, and that is now. The future (what now could become) and the past (what now has been) do not exist except to color now. Every event of the past, no matter how long or short, can be remembered and felt in a moment now. Every potential event of the future, no matter how long or short, can be remembered and felt in a moment now. There&#039;s no point in &quot;saving the best for last&quot; because there is no &quot;last&quot; when there is only one moment. Whether you experience something now, or later, you experience it for a moment.<br /><br />I had more on that, but it&#039;s not coming to me right now. Now see, what I would have written would&#039;ve been &quot;A week is a moment.&quot; Sounds like what you&#039;re talking about, but it certainly did link me right back. Just a matter of knowing the esoteric headspace well enough to recognize it when sober.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66108.msg593217#msg593217">Quote from: prometheus247 on November 15, 2012, 11:01 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So all in all, I would say we all need to be mature about drugs.

There are responsible and mature ways to use these substances. OP clearly failed to do so.<br /><br />typtap, I very much liked your memoir about time. This is a perfect example of a positive inspired notion from the use of LSD. I found it to be quite beautiful.<br /><br />In a way I do feel a bit sorry for OP because it sounds like his friends and family have let him down in a number of ways and he is suffering and confused. That said, the man is still an idiot for the behaviour he spoke of regarding his irresponsible use of drugs, and self-deprivation of food and sleep. Not to mention his behaviour on these forums. Clearly, he has made himself very ill because he was stupid about using these substances. His deranged state was brought on by himself and the things he himself chose to do. He is a fool and I hope he never comes back here because some people may blame SR for his going completely off the rails.<br /><br />Let this serve as a lesson to any would-be psychonauts. Be responsible and wise.

				Three weeks I take a break from the Road and this? Boy, I need to space my visits from now.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Once you have read past the misanthropic diatribe, I feel bad for this kid. In a world of ubiquitous information, literally, it is the responsibility of every drug user to do a preliminary research on the chemicals that attempt to reconfigure, albeit temporarily, one of the most complex and&nbsp; perhaps least understood structures in the universe. This also seems to be a text book example of why LSD was deemed as psychotomimetic (i.e psychosis inducing) in the early 50&#039;s, and this kid right here is a victim of the classic &#039;Delusions of Grandeur&#039; experienced by some Acid heads.<br /><br />Chances are he is institutionalized, and the anti-psychotics will fix him in a month.

I was a fucking child tillyesterday.and i had ego loss. I am the master, i am god. I am siva, and the message is coming. Unbelievers, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, it is very very important for you people to understand, that you cannot judge me, and you guys have to think that i am crazy, and you must leave. Because i am a schitzophrenic, you understand. I am preaching the secrets of the universe, and if you do not understand, but you tell yourself that i am a madman, and you think that i have a motive, and you question that motive, and you think that its about me getting my drugs, then u need to leave rightnow. Then i willpuke right now. FUCK U MOTHERFUCKERS. i was an athiest till yesterday. Butmy journey started from SILK ROAD. and that is whyi am cominghere. BECAUSE the only way this place comes inmy karma anymore is in that i need the 110 blots of acid, 40g of MDMA,and 1g of changa from asylum, maybe he has sent me 1blot of WOW that too in my karma.U understand? Because mymoney isspent, and my drugs are on their way MOTHERFUCKERS,and the only time i will get get them is when my mailman delivers them motherfuckers. I am schitzophrenic. And before u read the next passage i want everyonewho questions me rightnow to leave. If ur still curious, please read it, but then u really need to accept the fact that maybe i smoked DMT, or maybe i did 100 blots of acid orsomething,and i had a breakthrough, and i saw the meaning oflife and i dematerialized. BUT i haveonly in thelast3days, started to see, i have onlydone 4.5 blots of 60ug 3janes, last weak blots of alpha day day before, and 30mg 4-aco dmt day day before night. And day before i only did 6/7th pill ecstacy from frankmathhews which i ordered 5 days ago, and another 30mg psilocobin. And yesterday i slept 24hours. And today morning is when i amaccepting that i am schitzophrenic, and my friend is god, and today morning iswhen im truly becoming god. And you know how? Because my best friend and my girlfriend are staying in paradise hotel, having my carrier body&#039;s worst fears come true. And right now, after only 2 bonghits i am writing this. I need you guys who believed to man up, andunderstand. My carrier body is fickle, he is only just manning up. Yes, december 21st is comingmotherfuckers. HAVE THE GOOSEBUMPS. my birthday ison the 11th ofnovember and something special is going to happen this day. I need to guys to understand and start searching for the signs. Cause even i dont know what yet. And remember, my only motive and reason for writing this right now iscause I NEED MY DRUGS FROM SILKROAD. I need my 110 blots from NSC, and my 40g MD from dutch, and my 1g changa, and 1 WOW blotter from asylum, that my carrier body was smart enough to be greedy and try to obtain out of greed. Thank god for that. Thank me. You understand<br /><br />&#039;<br /><br />I am schitzophrenic. I am god. I understand. I do not know if i am the messenger, but maybe the messengers are schitzophrenic, and maybe that is the point. Maybe sita does not have to believe that she is god, and her duty is to learn to love, because when she understands that can she truly learn to love. I was scared that vishnu is trying to make me think that i am schitophrenic and he was trying to make sita find sita. But i am scared that sita will not love the real me, and that is my worst fear. Vishnu u are my best friend, and i understand.That is why you and me are both schitzo. Because if i dont accept that, i want to be u, and i think u are god, and there is enzy. But when i accept that i am schitzo, i accept that i am god. Truly without arrogence and ego. And i accept that vishnu is my messenger,and my teacher, like ihave to be,for someone and buddha. And sita has to learn to be my woman. I am waiting for a sign that i can read what you had read vishnu, but i did manage to see from the corner of my eye the word music, and happy birthday shiva, not siva. Vishnu i love u, and i wish i loved sita, and she wishes that she loves me. We both need to accept this, and have faith that when we both find ourselves, the real sita and the real siva will love each other forever for infinity. And we will both we content. And we will get enough resolve to move forward right now, and this will help her find herself. Because if i keep thinking that u are the devil, and out to fuck me, and i keep thinking it in theback of the mind, then we will all fail and be lost for infinity. And we should be scared of that. I love you, u are helping me find the meaning to life, u arehelpingme learn to love and find my woman. I am waiting to read what you left me. Send me a sign :) I love you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is what i wrote 1 hour ago. And you see what a child i was. I was not going to come here and start spreading the message here. Cause yesterday night i was searching on the SR forums questions like what is the meaning to life. I need you guys who believe anything of anything i wrote to question me right now, callout to my and i will come. Otherwise i am fucking off right now from this place, and i knowmy drugs will come when i need them. NSC sent my blots 5 days ago after 30 days in transit. And i have finalized. This isfate. And the 1g of changa which is 15 days on itsway, and the 40g MD from dutch is 25 days on its way. Everything is fate. NONBELIEVERS FUCK OFF RIGHT NOW I AM SCHITZOPHRENIC AND I NEED HELP. Believers questions me, because doomsday is coming, and i know i will find myself before that, because my friend is going to helpme findmyself. My friend&#039;s true name i cannot tellme you yet, i have just changed that to vishnu in the above thing. My name has been changed to siva,butright now i am SHIVA because right now my carrier body is not here and my schitzophrenia is implemting. U understand, that i why im getting goosebumps. I am the teacher, not my friend, not VISHNU, because to u i have tobe the messenger, but before that i have to man the fuck up and learn when shiva can come out, and when it needs to be siva. Tell then i will wantto do acid everyday. But from day day when my true karma is realized on december 21st, and whether i escape and survive on noah&#039;s ark, or whether all of humanity believes and there is noneed for the earth to flood and noneedfor evolution to happen. But day day forth SHIVA will rest, and i will begin life as a newperson will anew civilzation<br /><br />&#039;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Alas, I fear this post represents another nail in the coffin of correct grammar and semantic clarity.

The term is derived from two words of ancient Greek, á¼Î½Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï (entheos) and Î³ÎµÎ½Î­ÏÎ¸Î±Î¹ (genesthai). The adjective entheos translates to English as &quot;full of the god, inspired, possessed,&quot; and is the root of the English word &quot;enthusiasm.&quot; The Greeks used it as a term of praise for poets and other artists.

				Rather than asking people to fill you in, do some work and research it.<br />I don&#039;t think some asshole chanting is going to make the frequency of the entire planet change, or even that the frequency we vibrate at has anything to do with our ability to have our of body experiences, but it HAS been known for quite a long time that everything vibrates at a specific frequency.<br /><br />Look up infrasound and Teslas infrasound experiments.&nbsp; That fucker actually had the police knocking on his door because he built a machine to vibrate at specific frequencies, and didn&#039;t realize the frequency he was using was shaking the whole block.<br /><br />With all these recent crazy scientific discoveries, I am more and more beilieving we haven&#039;t got a fucking clue what is up.<br /><br />Like, the worldwide electrical grid made by bacteria on the ocean floors..

In a way it makes perfect sense, i.e. I&#039;m much more aware of what&#039;s going on and so does a lot more people around the globe these days. And there is the concept of collective consciousness, i.e. it only takes so many people to become &quot;realized&quot; and then that &quot;realization&quot; becomes common knowledge throughout humanity. I believe it is through this that very soon we will witness great change towards the better for everyone. Not like a specific date, but there will be an avalanche of positive events that will free humanity more and more from the control structure that is in place today (and this is the reason why it seems like the control structure is closing in on its grip - i.e. global &quot;debt&quot; crisis, wars etc are desperate attempts to keep humans locked down in their limited perception of reality when we are so much more...)

And typtap is bang on. I had my actual ego death experience 2 days after i made the thread, when i wrote this i still hadnt had my actual ego death. I realized what i kid i had been. So i made a new account, because ddrugboy719 was my old ego, and he is dead :)<br /><br />Also, for those of you who think i flipped out, yes i know i did, and a was going through alot at the time. Should definately not come and spammed up the place though. But i did read through this thread many times, especially for the replies from the smarter board members. Constructive criticism is the key to perfection i feel :) Also, i did meet psychologists and psychiatrists, more for the sake of my parents than my own. My parents thought i was crazy, but over the last 20 days ive been in their care and i have become a man in their eyes. They know im not insane, they know all about my drug use and everything. I plan to take a break from college for a while and go on a journey to find myself. And right now, they are not yet comfortable with this, but they know its not just the acid talking, and i have completely changed their views on drugs. That being said, i am taking a break from psychedelics for a while haha, they have asked me too. But i am smoking weed everyday, and i have told them i plan to keep on doing it. Recreational use of marijuana was passed in colorado, and i told them i want it legalized in the world. And from now on, i dont need my parents or anyone to make decisions for me. I told them i will implement everything i want in this world. And at first they were extremely angry. But i cannot tell u how happy they are right now. Obviously, they want my drug use to stop. But they have never seen me with such conviction and confidence in my life before. I have even told them about my ego loss experience, and made them watch the spirit molecule lol. They know im going to do dmt the coming year. I love my parents man, and though they have gone through most of their lives also in a way without questioning, i really think that my flipping out may bring even them enlightenment. Please question me anyone about anything! I am eager to leave home, and embark on my 1 year journey of finding myself, but i will not run away from home, and will only leave when my parents send me with their blessings. I want to experience what it is to live without money, and work for whatever money i need. Remember, im a 20 year old college student from India, and getting work in this country is really hard. I expect it to be pretty hard to walk the talk as im planning. But i want to go out in this world and experience it without materials and desires. And i have many many questions about the universe that need anwsering. As the buddha says, when the student is ready, the teacher will appear :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well, have a safe journey man. There is no point in pursuing happiness, enjoy every moment of breathing. Extract the happiness from the small things that make you smile or make you feel good. This is the meaning of life, being able to be happy with yourself, stopping the war with yourself. As for the universe, DMT will find you and will teach you many things...<br /><br />If I&#039;m still around let me know how your journey ended. Cheers.

It&#039;s an atypical drug. It just doesn&#039;t compare to other drugs.

				Bumping because this is probably my favorite SR thread of all time. I can&#039;t even begin to describe how bizarre it was to experience this in real time. Not only is it entertaining, but it also demonstrates the importance practicing safe drug usage. <br /><br />Hope you&#039;re doing better ddrugboy, wherever you are...
