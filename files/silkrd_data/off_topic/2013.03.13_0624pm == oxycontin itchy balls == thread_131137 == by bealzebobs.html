				Does anyone else get especially itchy balls when on opiods such ax oxycodone? I know itching is normal but mine always seems to be around the groin area, and no I dont have crabs.

				Hey dude,<br /><br />Sorry to hear about your balls! It has to do with histamines released by the oxy. I used to have the same issue, only with my face. I would itch and itch and itch my nose until it was raw. I then discovered promethazine, and it made the itch much more manageable. I now also sell promethazine: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/14ce055f38&nbsp; in packs of 2 pills. If you want bulk (20+ tabs) message me on SR, and we can talk. Another great thing about it is that it seems to also potentiate the sedation from the opiates. If you&#039;ve never tried it, give it a go. It will help!<br /><br />Stay safe! <br /><br />-Johnny

				Benedryl is an opiate users best friend. Any antihistamine will do, but benedryl is fairly strong and readily available for cheap, plus it also helps with nausea. That said, promethazine will do a better job and will potentiate the high a bit, like Johnny said, so if you&#039;ve got the BTC or even insurance I&#039;d go that route. You can go to the doc and say you&#039;re nauseous and 9 times out of 10 they&#039;ll prescribe promethazine/

				Well everyone else already mentioned the methods I was going to suggest.<br /><br />Both promathiazine (Fenegren) and Diphenhydramine (Benedryl) will make you tired, however there is a trade off. The Fenegren will knock you the fuck out (at least it does me (and that&#039;s by itself)) but it will also seriously potentiate the opioids. The Benedryl will do just as good a job if not better at quelling the itch and will make you less tired, however it will not really potentiate much at all.
