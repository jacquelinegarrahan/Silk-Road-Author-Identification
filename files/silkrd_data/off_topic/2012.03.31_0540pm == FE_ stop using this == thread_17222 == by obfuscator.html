				I think Finalizing early should be outright outlawed.. Too many scams to justify it in any way.. Even if you &#039;need&#039; it to get more in stock.. if you cant afford to hold it in escrow do not sell it!<br /><br />My opinion..

				Acronyms and shorthand will always be around, and will always evolve and become normalized. I was furious 16 years ago when I first saw LOL being used and was told what it meant. <br /><br />now, its normal and i have used it from time to time

				I don&#039;t understand what all this fury directed toward &quot;finalizing early&quot; is.<br /><br />First people hated vendors forcing finalizing early. Fair enough, you want to work within escrow and they don&#039;t/can&#039;t. Valid concern.<br /><br />Then people complained that people left comments including &quot;finalizing early.&quot; Oook. So as I finalize I either leave a something stupid, &quot;Great vendor! Haven&#039;t gotten my product yet, of course...&quot; Something non-descriptive, &quot;...&quot; Or something accurate about the transaction process thus far &quot;Finalizing early, will update later/in forums.&quot; The last one makes the most sense, since it gives other buyers a good idea how many people may have been screwed by the vendor, or how many buyers are still waiting on product, or whatever...<br /><br />Now we have people complaining that &quot;FE&quot; should be written out as &quot;Finalizing Early.&quot; Really? Some people don&#039;t give a damn about the feedback process and will give whatever feedback they like, whether or not you complain about abbreviations or not. <br /><br />Unless this is some meta thread that&#039;s actual a parody/April Fool&#039;s joke, in which case I look stupid. On second thought, I wish I made this thread.

You can come back later to leave feedback, even though you have finalized. This should be clearer, as it looks as if you have to leave feedback after finalizing.<br /><br />On topic: fuck that, FE is nice and short. Also, certain &#039;lingo&#039; will generally help in community building.
