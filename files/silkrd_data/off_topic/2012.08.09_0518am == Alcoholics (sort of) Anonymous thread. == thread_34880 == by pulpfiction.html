				Figured I&#039;d see if anyone else enjoys alcohol occasionally, I know I&#039;m not the only one. Love good ales and good wine. Nothing compliments some medicinal, in my opinion, like a glass of ice cold Pinot Grigot. Would love to hear some recommendations for some wines/ales that I could try.

				I&#039;m drunk right now! I probably drink a bit too much but fuck it! My drinks of choice are 4 Loko (tastes awful but gets you nice and drunk) Gin and Tonic (just amazing) and Hard Cider (specifically Woodchuck brand but I think that&#039;s USA only)

				Well a word of advise to anyone wanting off of it.<br />Like people who are addicted i urge you to look into mescaline can be found naturally in certain types of cacti.Also ayahusca very good medicine for getting off alcohol as well.Also lsd,but its more productive if its a guided therapy session.With lsd the person is in control of the trip there really is no spirit to acid.Mescaline,ayahusca have spirits that help those who are willing to accept the help.They are very friendly spirits :).

				Scotch for me. Glenfiddich served on the rocks is excellent and you look classy as fuck as well :)<br /><br />Other than that any craft beer and fancy ciders like Rekordalig are always good.<br /><br />As for quitting, LSD did wonders for me. I still drink, but no where near as much as I did before my first few LSD trips. It sort of allowed me to reflect on why I drank and why I don&#039;t really need to. Well not as much as I was anyway.

				I&#039;ve been drinking pretty much every day of this summer, whether it&#039;s beer or stronger stuff. I seldom get drunk, but nevertheless, I have at least one or two drinks a day. Does that make me an alcoholic ? Don&#039;t think so.

				Drinker here singing in.&nbsp; I really do like a drink after work.&nbsp; I have to work in a warehouse with only 5 per cent english and practically no Air Con to speak of.&nbsp; This time of year it gets fucking hot and to be honest all you can think about towards the end of the day is a nice cold drink.<br />My drink of choice, white wine chardonnay chilled in the fridge for an hour. 8)
