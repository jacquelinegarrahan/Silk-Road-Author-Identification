				I am just shy of 18. My reasons should not concern anyone on here, but I appreciate anyone who cares. I need someone who is intelligent to help me come up with a comprehensive plan for leaving. I just need questions answered. Some problems I have at the moment are as follows:<br /><br />My money is in a bank account that my parent&#039;s have control over even though the account is in my name.<br /><br />I need to know where I can stay once I leave.<br /><br />I need to know how to find a good source of income that isn&#039;t illegal.<br /><br />I need to know how to survive and avoid anyone that comes looking for me.<br /><br /><br />Thank you to anyone who helps.

				Don&#039;t do it, I did it and regret it. I worked my ass off for two years with a cannabis grower just to stay alive and barely manage to make connections to do, well, more illegal things. <br /><br />You should still be able to pull out all of your money even though your parents control it and if you can&#039;t then you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />You can stay at hostels but they hate people that stay any longer than a week and will most likely kick you out which will force you to be homeless and live on the streets unless you move somewhere where it&#039;s cheap to rent a studio/room. <br /><br />If you can even get hired, you&#039;re not even an adult yet so most jobs are going to be hard if not impossible for you to get but if you try hard enough you might get an odd job off craigslist (that&#039;s why I worked for a grower, I was homeless and when I applied for a job they generally don&#039;t accept homeless runaways) <br /><br />You can survive by rationing your sources, there are plenty of guides online on how to survive on literally nothing and avoiding people that come looking for you isn&#039;t going to be easy and if anything is only going to make your life a pain because you can&#039;t really use your identity to do much or else they can easily trace you. <br /><br />Again, I got lucky when I ran away, I found a job with a cannabis grower than gave me a job and a shed to sleep in and I was barely surviving. I worked my ass off for years and am now just okay (not making hundreds of thousands of dollars but I&#039;m financially good now). I wish I could go back in time, stay in school and learn as much as I could and go into a field I enjoy doing. If you do decide to do it goodluck, the road is going to be extremely rough ahead.

				If the bank account is in your name, go into the bank with ID and ask to withdraw money. See what happens. Also, where are you from? Some of the questions you ask might have better answer depending on your location.

				Some more information would definitely be helpful. What you&#039;re asking is a very difficult endeavor depending on parameters. <br /><br />To what extent do you need to avoid people? If it&#039;s just your parents their abilities to hunt you down would likely be negligible unless they have some sociopathic reason to hunt you down. Get to whatever border of the country makes you most comfortable/puts the most distance between you and your problem. If you have family/friends who can help in some respect that would be good (although I guess not an option if you&#039;re here). <br /><br />Make sure the problem requires this drastic a measure also. However: if you&#039;re 16 or 17 getting a job should be doable in the US (if I recall). Even so, cost of living means you should get to where you&#039;re going and make some friends fast so you can have roommates to split the cost of living with.<br /><br />Fast food chains usually higher people under 18 so that would be a legal source of income. Craigslist is chancy but if you exhaust other options (there are still classifieds in the newspapers for jobs/roommates needed and such) see if you can find a place to live/job there. <br /><br />Also: wherever you move I would suggest picking a city/town with a university in it. They will have lots of college students who also need to live on a budget giving you people with common needs that you can mutually benefit from. <br /><br />Good luck and remember to look at every option before committing. This will change your whole life.

				My only issue is transportation at this point, I&#039;m not old enough to apply for a credit card, and therefore unable to buy plane tickets. And I need plane tickets. I plane to leave the house in the middle of the night, so by the time they wake up I&#039;ve already landed hopefully. I would try to get some contacts ahead of time but I don&#039;t know how I could pull that off. Also, I would just need to avoid police at this point then. I&#039;m intending to stay under the radar until I&#039;m 18.

				Getting somewhere can be an issue. If you know anybody nearby who could get you so far that&#039;d be a start. A lone teen walking roads at night would be suspicious as hell if you&#039;re dodging cops. Still, in US I don&#039;t see the cops trying to card you just for walking around once you get so far. I&#039;m not sure how plane tickets work there but if you can&#039;t get a plane ticket see where the nearest bus stop is.<br /><br />&nbsp;Most bigger cities tend to have some sort of long-distance ground transport that people can buy tickets too. I&#039;d see if you can find one close to you and try to order your ticket online. If you have some sort of photo ID that should be fine even if you are under 18 (assuming they require ID to purchase a ticket). Some buses do stops late at night also. <br /><br />Look into bus schedules before trying to get onto a plane. Airline security in most areas of the US are notoriously invasive now and you will likely attract more attention then you want.

				I would not recommend it as I am a few years older now and had thought about it many times and even got kicked out of the house a few times. Now my lil bro is going through it but much worse. YOU WILL REGRET IT. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable or have the hook ups to make your living selling drugs or yourself then you are going to have to work your ass off your whole life and unless you get real lucky will never have enough money to retire on or even have much fun on. At the moment, like my bro, you prolly think this would still be better than living at home. Unless you are being molested or beaten, which you should just report, then I recommend you just stick it out because real life being COMPLETELY independent is not as easy as it sounds. Honest and integrity don&#039;t go very far like they used to. It&#039;s all about who you now or how you look or how much money you have. Stay home and tuff it out because in life after school you will face much harder challenges than you are now.

				I would avoid planes if I were you.&nbsp; If you want to avoid cops the last place you should be is attempting to board an airplane in the United States.&nbsp; It&#039;s only a matter of time before TSA is collecting pube samples from nuns going through airport security.<br /><br />Unfortunately I think you are likely going to be hitch hiking or paying for long term rides.&nbsp; If you have the time you need to do a shit ton of research.&nbsp; There are websites that you can find for couch surfing, ride sharing, etc.&nbsp; You&#039;re just going to have to hope the people you run into don&#039;t care about your age.&nbsp; If you look older than what you are (I have a suspicion you are younger than 17) then you should say you are 18 or older, whatever you can pass for.&nbsp; If you have bitcoins and can get mail you could purchase a fake id on silk road.<br /><br />As for where you are going, pick a city with a population of kids in similar positions.&nbsp; This carries plus and minus implications, but cities with a homeless/drifter population usually have some sort of support structure from activists in place.&nbsp; Look up what cities have Food Not Bombs and show up for a free meal.&nbsp; Those are anarchist-communists, they are usually good people.&nbsp; You may even find someone to take you in, but use your judgment on that, if the person seems odd, don&#039;t do it.&nbsp; If you have time purchase a Slingshot online.&nbsp; It is a small notebook/calendar with every leftist radical book shop and cafe in the world.&nbsp; You can often find helpful people at some places, free meals, hell, maybe even some work.&nbsp; Microcosim Publishing has those, they have them on amazon so you can probably get one shipped in an Amazon box if you are worried about your parents being suspicious about you mail.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you think family and cops will be looking for you then you are likely to get caught, so don&#039;t do anything on your way out that you don&#039;t want to have to answer for.&nbsp; Good luck comrade.

				Oh yeah and if you are female, you are going to be in for a much tougher few years.&nbsp; Really think hard if you have to do this, because there are few reasons why someone would have to.&nbsp; Physical and sexual abuse are two reason to look into this, but to be honest you risk those on the road also.&nbsp; Just find the leftists, and hope you come across some good people&nbsp; West Coast has plenty of that type, and lots of those people have/are living on the streets.&nbsp; Austin has some anarchists.&nbsp; Pacific Northwest is full of them.&nbsp; Hopefully you don&#039;t end up in some church shelter being told the world sucks because you don&#039;t talk to a non existent god enough.&nbsp; If you must do it use the church for a meal or clothes but then get the fuck out of there.&nbsp; Also look into really really free markets.&nbsp; They are all over and are places where people bring free stuff to give away, no money or barter.&nbsp; You will find people there who may help you out.

				You can&#039;t go on a plane without getting caught. I would buy a greyhound ticket and go wherever you&#039;re going, just be prepared to experience the worse things ever. I remember I would have to hang out with meth heads to find out where I could get good, I never did meth myself because you look at them and that&#039;s what they spent all their money on. It was horrible being 18 and homeless, people will want to use you, rob you, rape you, stuff you can&#039;t even imagine. <br /><br />Your reasons aren&#039;t good enough, trust me. Even if you&#039;re getting beat by your parents to death there are plenty of alternatives and running away will make your life a living hell, just step back and think about your life as a runaway when you turn 23 years old. <br /><br />

				Go somewhere that requires lawn maintenance like California. People often pay young people to do this kind of work. I pulled weeds out of a yard for an hour one time and made $90. I got lucky that time, but other times it was still worth it and well above minimum wage. By doing this your name won&#039;t be on any system. Say you&#039;re saving up for college. You should try to find the wealthy neighborhoods. Hopefully you have money to invest in some tools, or maybe they&#039;ll let you use theirs. You have to knock on doors, but the internet could help too. <br /><br />Take the Greyhound there. You think slaves ran away on a plane? No. Keep it old school. I&#039;m not sure if Greyhound &quot;tracks&quot; people. If they do you might want to arrive in San Diego for example, and hitch a ride to LA. These are just examples, LA can be pretty dangerous for a runaway. <br /><br />Go to the beach and make friends. Hopefully someone will let you crash at their house. You can probably find a gay male to let you crash at his place but expect to return sexual favors. You can make money this way as well. Just keep in mind the consequences: trauma, std&#039;s, getting killed, etc. If you get really lucky you&#039;ll get a girlfriend who&#039;s parents are cool and will let you stay until you&#039;re 18. This is how my friend ran away actually.<br /><br />Eat cheap. Be smart. Stay alert. Be aware of your surroundings.<br /><br />p.s. I don&#039;t know your reasons. I&#039;m only offering you advice because if you&#039;re going to be an idiot and do it anyway, you might as well get some useful information. Unless you are already getting abused, then there&#039;s no reason to run away. And if something really bad is happening at home then you can get help from authorities. You seriously can&#039;t talk to your parents? You have a bank account with money in it, so it can&#039;t be as bad. Be grateful for what you have cause the grass is not always greener on the other side.

				you can buy a pre-paid Green Dot card ,[Visa or Mastercard], and load like at least $500-$1000. They have those at a ton of different stores. If you can&#039;t find a store to buy a pre-paid card like that to load at least like $500 for plane tickets then you probably won&#039;t have much luck running away and be resourceful solely by yourself.
