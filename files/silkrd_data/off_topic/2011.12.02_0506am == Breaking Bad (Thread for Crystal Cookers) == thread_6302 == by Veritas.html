				Just a quick question for anyone who actually cooks crystal.<br /><br />Do you really have to wear a gas mask and rubber apron through every step of the process? Seems a little done-up to me.

				I don&#039;t cook crystal but I do like Breaking Bad and I&#039;m pretty sure they only wear the masks during certain steps of the process. However, it is a tv show and they have a tenancy of being done-up from time to time. I want to see that blue crystal for sale on here though haha

				Never worn a gas mask (never had the need to) but I also avoid working with deadly gasses.

				Safety equipment while doing any chemical reactions is very important. Even when being very careful accidents can happen. A beaker can be toppled over and a caustic solution is sprayed into your eyes or your lab coat catches fire (you can easily rip it off) just to name a couple reasons why safety is important.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have a proper fume hood for ventilation then it&#039;s best to wear a respirator that filters harmful organic substances.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Very true. I don&#039;t have the luxury of a fumehood (yet!) but once I start making enough money, and my business here grows it&#039;s the first thing on my &quot;to do&quot; list. Right now I try to keep everything in enclosed reactions by using gas traps and scrubbers. And so of course there&#039;s the chance that something will go wrong so I do have a gas mask hidden away somewhere, I&#039;ve just never needed to use it yet.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=6302.msg54774#msg54774">Quote from: gumby on December 02, 2011, 05:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When cooking MDMA is it possible for everything to go up in flames like meth manufacturers that are in the news sometimes dopeboy?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I&#039;m guessing most clandestine lab fires are caused by solvents like toluene and acetone.

A few more minutes and the entire room would&#039;ve been on fire.<br /><br />Making MDMA with the Aluminum amalgamation 1)gives off hydrogen which is explosive, 2)requires methanol at boiling temperature which is flammable and 3)requires methylamine gas which is toxic and explosive. So to answer your question, yes it is possible to end up in the news like meth manufacturers. But I think for the most part making MDMA takes a lot more preparation is a multi-step process that requires more time to learn, it&#039;s not just &quot;toss these 3 ingredients in the flask and cook for 3 hours&quot; like some meth synths.

				Safety comes in all levels. It surprises me how unsafe people can be, as I never follow the book in anything I do,but have never blown myself up. I think the stories of redneck methlab explosions would be true whether meth was involved or not, some people are just likely to blow themselves up. and anytime that can be used to promote the &#039;illegal drugs are bad!&#039; cause, they use it.&nbsp; As for the original question. I&#039;ve seen people, in any manufacturing proccess, go their whole lives without using respirators that other would not go one day without. So saying you &#039;have&#039; to do somthing doesnt mean much. But the unknown that catches up with you down the road should lean more people towards a higher degree of safety,not a lesser one.

I am fascinated by what you do. As you probably know from my posts by now I am very against meth but love MDMA. Keep on making money though Dopeboy!
