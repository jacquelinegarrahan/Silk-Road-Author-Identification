				So here it is, after the long and bumpy road It&#039;s time for me to leave.<br />I have been on this forum for a long time now, and have spoken to some incredible people. The very essence of having access to an anonymous marketplace to buy drugs online was not what kept me here, however much it contributed to my problems and in turn solutions there was always the driving force behind this amazing place, the community. A completely anonymous forum, people from all over the world, of different ages, knowledge, everyone on here is different but we have one thing in common; Our intention and wish for anonymity, a wish to be able to do to ourselves what we please with complete safety and without effecting anyone but ourselves. <br /><br />The forum; A place where you are able to meet people of all ages, intelligent, funny, smart and generous individuals, with no discrimination upon who, where or even what you are, as there is no need to know. The road has changed my life, both for through the good times and the bad, both causing problems and , although temporary, creating solutions. But now I feel it is time to leave this place for now, although I expect I will be back under another anonymous alias to resort to the kindness and simply just the knowledge, intelligence and advice that the forum holds. <br />I am leaving to sort my life out. My life is just haphazard, a mess, I get through something,and get knocked right back down; an endless cycle that drugs seem to be the solution to, but I need to get through this on my own. The drugs simply bring up the highs, and then cause a lot more damage on the way down, and I simply cannot handle this at the moment, which is why I need to keep away.<br /><br />Although I have said otherwise in the past, I joined this site 16 months ago at the age of 13. I was simply an immature child back then, and although you may not have noticed, or even interacted with me the pushing force that is the forum has impacted me massively, causing me to stop fucking around and get on with life. I am sure that you can see why, but If, as someone who believes that they at least contribute to the movement, is known to be a 14 year old, that defeats the lifeblood of the forum, in a way removing the layer of anonymity that makes me continue to use the forum; Being able to be myself and simply interact with other people and escape without being instantly judged. The common assumption of a 14 year old on such a forum is thought of as a stupid, immature child that has found his way onto a &#039;drug website&#039; and will instantly start posting pictures of the drugs gained by using such a place onto facebook and tumblr, however this could not be further away from me.<br /><br />I am just interested, given that I have made a fair few contributions to this forum, and I expect that many of you will have seen some of my posts around the forum. Would/Does it surprise you that I am a 14 year old? I am just mentioning such a fact because I would like to know what people would think. It is truly what makes the forum, and I understand I have repeated myself many times but just being able to become part of such a place without being judged by what I do or who I am. I may only be 14 but this last year has been the worst, best, weirdest and just the shittest time of my life. This past year I have been forced to grow up and live for myself, without having to rely on other people. I have started reading into many different books, philosophy, I&#039;ve ventured into meditation and aim to become a generally knowledgeable individual regardless of who I am. This past year drugs have been a massive part of my life, even in these last 3 weeks I have experienced DMT, LSD, 2CB, Ketamine and Mescaline for the first time in an attempt to rid me of the pain but, although amazing at the time I feel that they have made the hole inside me even bigger.<br /><br />I&#039;ve exploited many people&#039;s generosity and I truly do feel bad, but I am going to leave you.<br />If still around, I can&#039;t promise I&#039;m not going to be creating another account and building reputation to become a part of something once again, I truly do not know.<br />This has been a massive write, but if not for you this is for me, as a way to release something build inside, to explain to the people that I exploited and simply leave you all with something before I leave. <br /><br />I sure am going to miss you all,<br />Locker.

				LOL I can just see an excerpt from his posting on fox news from Bill O&#039;Reilly or on the senate floor from some douchebag like Sen. Lindsey Graham telling the American people that the Silk Road has made it possible for a 13 year old to buy &quot; DMT, LSD, 2CB, Ketamine and Mescaline&quot; in the past 3 weeks alone and he&#039;s one in a thousand children using the site, buying drugs, selling them at school and etc etc.<br /><br />Is it your goal to attract attention like that? I don&#039;t understand. <br /><br />Young, dumb and full&#039;a cum sounds like.

				No doubt all those who believe that the OP affects SR&#039;s security have brought it to the attention of the moderators. If the moderators choose to leave it up, then your argument should be with them.<br /><br />The details of the OP are unverifyable and the poster&#039;s identy is unknown. IMHO the post is of little or no consequence to the security of SR. If all it took to threaten the existence of Silk Road were outrageous stories of self-incrimination, then the forums would be full of such posts written by people wishing to have SR closed down. The reason that reporters don&#039;t flood the forums with similar tales and use them as the basis for sensationalist articles is because they lack credibilty by virtue of being anonymous.<br /><br />On forums where everyone&#039;s identity is hidden, I try to keep in mind that every post is a possible troll.<br /><br />

				This is funny to me, I was a kid on a drug board back in the day too... Cept I didn&#039;t have to lie to get my free drugs. Nope, just gave vendors my parents address for free samples in exchange for positive review of the substances... And they were honest to god positive reviews, I was so happy to get all fucked up on new shit!! LOL..<br /><br />No but seriously OP, fuck you. I wish I was a little kid right now I would have been blasting off on DMT at 14 instead of fucking alprazolam powder and fucking ritalin analogs!!! THINK OF WHERE I COULD HAVE BEEN!!!

				Well first off, You shouldn&#039;t be giving out identifying info like that your a minor, cause not only does that negatively reflect this community, It gives LEO more reason to shut this place down.<br />And 2nd, you got loans for coins and never re-paid So you&#039;re 2 for 2 on being a piece of shit.

				After a quick flick through your post history I can see that you talked regularly about being 17 and having a job/ getting home from work last year. So I am presuming that you&#039;re trying the &#039;I&#039;m 14&#039; thing to garner sympathy and get out of paying back the BTC you owe. <br /><br />Regardless of whether you&#039;re fourteen or eighteen, you&#039;re clearly too young emotionally to handle the smorgasbord of drugs available on SR. A literal kid in a candy store. So if I was your RL friend I&#039;d advise you to stay away from it all for a while. <br /><br />I know an 18-year-old very well and my advice to them has been this:-<br /><br />Get a job with regular hours and hard physical labour - and to find the one that pays the most. It may seem shit but no job&#039;s perfect and at 18 you need a physical outlet for all that pent up energy. People your age need routine and to learn self-discipline and a regular job does that for you. The confidence of earning money and the changes in your physical appearance from working hard will give you an aura of self-respect and you&#039;ll get yourself a girlfriend and feel &#039;anchored&#039;. Failing that, you could volunteer doing something to help other people which will stop you being so introspective. <br /><br /><br />Self-pity and boredom are your enemies right now and hard work&#039;s good for your soul. Quit trying to get everyone&#039;s sympathy, a more valiant route would be to be honest or to stay quiet.<br /><br />I strongly urge you to pay back that BTC. Using your mother dying or your age as a reason not to is a pretty douchey approach.

				Fuck me Op my mum died when I was 11, I&#039;ve been homeless when times were bad and then times have been good but I got a job, worked hard harder than anyone else at the place I was even when using drugs I have never missed a day of work unless I was truely sick no hanging out sick or coming down sick I went on those days.<br />Adversity seperates the men from the boys, something bad happens instead of sitting feeling sorry for yourself get up and make something.<br />With no help I own and run my own business because I dont feel sorry for myself when something happens I see it as a hurdle to get over to succeed. At 18 i started on H and if I wasnt strong i would be like the rest of them junkies eeking out an exsistance. But Im not i dont let drugs run me or my life soooo<br />Be a man pay your debts thats what men do and im sure your mum would wont you to be a man.<br />Then get your shit together and live your life the best you can try and make your mother proud..

If as you say you have, looked at my furthest post history and when I first joined, you will see what I was like when I first joined and the way I wrote. I have since aimed to become overall more knowledgeable, intelligent and come across better than I did. (And look how that turned out). I would also like to point out, you&#039;re the one calling me a &#039;fucking FAG lol&#039;, so it seems that you are not the 18-19 year old you compare me to.<br /><br />You have all missed the point of this post under the mass of hate and, albeit some interesting posts. This did not happen over a few pathetic Bitcoins that were spared, if they believed there was even the slightest chance of them not returning they would have not sent Bitcoins that were needed. I did intent to pay these loans back at some point, however I now have no means of even buying Bitcoins myself so I can not. This post was simply a note to leave people with, almost an explanation towards my exodus from the road that is undoubtedly going to be attributed to the small amount of Bitcoins that I was loaned.<br /><br />For people checking my post history, please read the post anew. The reason I use the road is because of the obvious lack of and inability to judge me upon anything other than the things I write. As said I have said other things in the past, in circumstances that required me to give some information I had to build onto the persona in which I was giving. My past on this forum is simply an act that I was forced to build upon. There is no way to prove that I&#039;m not trolling, but what would that achieve? This post gives me the mental release that I wouldn&#039;t get otherwise, I can say and admit such things that I have not told anyone, and even if people don&#039;t read it it helps. <br /><br />This is not me &#039;being a pussy&#039; and running away, this is my resolution. I am not trying to hide from my problems, and that is the reason I am leaving; I am trying to sort things out. Currently I am focusing on schoolwork (To an extent, currently I feel that the education they try to give me is somewhat making things worse, in a way dumbing me down over years of repetition that I have left to tolerate). Focusing on becoming smarter, reading books, learning new things and simply getting things sorted. I am by no means going to live the life of which 14 year olds should and do live, but honestly I count that as an asset.<br /><br />I am simply waiting for this post to become insulted by ignorant posts that misunderstand things that I have said and quickly change the subject of the post, but truly I do not care.<br />Locker.

				Well you certainly have the self-obsession of a 14-year-old. You haven&#039;t &quot;built up a reputation&quot; here, no-one sees you as an authority on anything and you won&#039;t be missed. Had you left these forums the only people who would have noticed are the ones you owe money to and to whom you&#039;re sending privnotes to saying, &#039;Never trust the road&#039;. From that perspective your reputation is nothing. Less than zero. And 100% of nothing is precisely fuck all - which is exactly what you&#039;ve contributed to &quot;the road&quot;. <br /><br />If you want to write anonymously then start a blog on the clearnet and vent your self-obsessed post-DMT trip thoughts there. <br /><br />Now run along, dear.

				Locker I&#039;ve complimented your writing before - the trip report of you taking K was very well written.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe you&#039;re 14.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;d be lying so much about so many things.&nbsp; <br /><br />One thing that is inexcusable is your unwillingness to repay the&nbsp; BTC you borrowed.&nbsp; We reap what we sew and Karma is the great equalizer.&nbsp; When we do someone harm, we reap the repurcussions.&nbsp; How can you expect anyone to feel bad for you when you&#039;ve been a thief?&nbsp; And seem proud of it?&nbsp; You managed to buy a lot of drugs over the past year.&nbsp; Why not at least repay the good people who loaned you money?&nbsp; Your excuses for why you can&#039;t repay are just lame excuses.&nbsp; Even a REAL 14 year old could wash dishes to earn some money.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even though you are anonymous on the forums, and there is some division between SR and IRL, your will is still transferable and you will reap the negative energy as long as you refuse to repay.<br /><br />Repaying those loans is one small gesture that would give you a lot of peace of mind.&nbsp;

				From what I can tell, ole&#039; chubby checker sent privnotes to &#039;Box of Shapes&#039; when he asked him why he hadn&#039;t paid back the money he owed to him, John Gotti, Ron Swanson and maybe others too from the Spare Coins thread. I guess it was about BTC1 total. Locker wrote back via privnote messages sent in IM things like &quot;Never trust the road&quot; when he was on a DMT trip on Friday night - bought with said coins. <br /><br />He also sent multiple PMs to Box whining and trying to play the sympathy card (EG: &#039;I&#039;m just a kid and my mum&#039;s dead&#039; etc. etc.) and when Box stopped replying and outed him in the spare coins thread telling people to neg him and not lend to him, he started this thread for attention instead.<br /><br />And that is today&#039;s installment of the Silk Road Forums &#039;Off Topic&#039; thread soap opera.

				Damn.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t know about John Gotti.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t mind me adding to the absolute mess of things he has said, after he sent me the &quot;don&#039;t trust the road&quot; message, the following one had something in it like, &quot;I have a hard time trusting people&quot;.&nbsp; (I kind of forget cause they were deleted pretty quick.&nbsp; I just wanted to be done with it)&nbsp; I mean, I know it&#039;s the road, but really?&nbsp; I try not to have an ego around here but someone can honestly say this about me?&nbsp; <br /><br />At that point I knew anything he says has no value.&nbsp; Wouldn&#039;t you know it, cause when I came to that conclusion, that&#039;s when I got the &quot;I&#039;m 14&quot; message.<br /><br />So after I got that, I just glazed over, deleted it and went to bed.&nbsp; Woke up in the morning to this thread.&nbsp; <br /><br />I fear the paradox of the title of the thread will shear the planet apart.&nbsp; That or I&#039;m going to find out I have a pretty big library fine I didn&#039;t know about.

				Just adding my 2¢....<br /><br />OP I don&#039;t know you or know anything about you, I just happened to read the first post and a bit of the first page, but if you really are 14, you may want to consider taking a break from all substances (using weed only rarely) until you are at least 16-18+....ideally the later the better. Others are right, your brain still is developing (both physically as in growing more neurons, balancing neurotransmitter levels and whatnot- and physiologically), and well into your 20&#039;s as best I know, and doing all sorts of powerful hallucinogens regularly at a young age cannot be good for you physically, maybe mentally too...<br /><br />Hell, I didn&#039;t even start smoking weed until I was 18, and didn&#039;t start taking other harder/more exotic stuff until I was around 20 and in college. In retrospect I am glad that I waited as with my personality, I would have had a world of untold shit if I found this stuff earlier...<br /><br />So yeah it&#039;ll probably be hard, but it may be for the better. And in 10-50 years you&#039;ll look back at these times and realize that everyone telling you to take it easy maybe did know what they were talking about...

But of course, BoxOfShapes Is just going to tell people about it. He may have incredible writing skills, but some of the stuff he&#039;s done definitely give the impression of a 14 year old, that clearly hasn&#039;t thought things out.&nbsp; ::)<br />~D

				i don&#039;t know what the privnote he sent me said as when i went on it, it said note destroyed and something about java but obviously it never displayed the note without javascript enabled. the only people you hear of sending privnotes out the blue are scum, blackmailers and extortionists so it concluded the situation without needing the actual message.

				Maybe he&#039;s just a retarded, antisocial, &gt;portly 20 year old or something, He&#039;s pretty articulate for a kid that age.. But then i was too before drugs wrecked my brain. Anyway enough about him I reckon he loves the fact this threads not dead yet, might make him feel..popular. Lets just let it fade into obscurity, the sad old lump blatently isnt going to pay you guys back :(, but i&#039;d bet my top hat and monocle that he&#039;s already made a new account to try and intergrate into the community again.. He could actually be..any one.of.you..<br /><br />Sorry i&#039;m pretty wrecked i&#039;m probably spouting nonsense<br /><br />

				^ Some that i know that have left us started before 16, some after. Heroin doesn&#039;t discriminate mate, age race sexuality whatever, it affects em all. i&#039;m sure there are 15 year old, in fact i KNOW there are youguns that have more brains that 25yr olds, a 37 year old that i know who tantrums like a kid..and she has a kid. Age is just a number<br /><br />Except with this guy, he brings his kind a bad name (overweight white spoilt middle class child, or at least brought up that way), am i right? You seem immensely proud of the fact you can type coherently, and you have a wholey undeserved sense of entitlment, a huge ego. Oh and you&#039;re a scamming cunt and still havn&#039;t paid the guys back. Guys can we stop bumpting this thread, and just let him be forgotten? Peace out
