				so, just like 10 mins ago, my mom comes into the living room to say good night. she exclaims in surprise that my face is full of red blotches, apparently my upper back is full of it too. Just took benadryl to alleviate it. My first thoughts is &quot;fuck, I shouldn&#039;t have drank that apple juice&quot; see, I&#039;m hypersenstive to apple juice (not allergic, if I was, it&#039;d be an analytic shock coming on). and in the past 24 hours, I haven&#039;t had any drugs other than alcohol. I&#039;ve been drinking screwdrivers all night today, orange juice and vodka. so we have no idea what caused this histamine reaction. <br /><br />I&#039;m just paranoid, im not gonna sleep until I know that I&#039;m able to breathe while asleep.

				Haha...you live with your mom. ;D Only joking, are you allergic to anything or sensitive to something other than apple juice? The only advice I can give for now is stay away from that damn juice! :P

				hey, i&#039;m 22 and broke. no way for me to go to school full time and take a job full time without having a nervous break down. lol. I do have an opiate sensitivity, I can&#039;t tolerate percocets, oxycontion, oxycodine (all in the morphine family) very well. <br /><br />I&#039;m able to drink apple juice as long it&#039;s well pasteurized, I guess this is my first &quot;LOL NO YOU CAN&#039;T DRINK ME&quot;. I can eat apple pies (because the apples themselves are baked/cooked therefore the allergens are cooked out. I don&#039;t know, I just have random red blotches on my back and one on my arm and all over my face.

				I used to get red blotched all over my body regularly. I switched to unscented hypoallergenic laundry detergent, and they have never reappeared.<br /><br />maybe you can ask your mommy to wash your clothes with different detergent ( I am assuming she does your laundry also)

				Napoleon was originally born in an island owned by Spain but France was all about &quot;MY ISLAND&quot;. technically, Napoleon was spanish, he just wanted to take over the world for shits and giggles but if he hadn&#039;t lost the conquest for the Caribbean islands which made him broke, he had to sell the Louisiana to Jefferson to recoup his losses. If he hadn&#039;t lost that conquest, the untied states of america as we know it would be a fucking french colony.&nbsp;
