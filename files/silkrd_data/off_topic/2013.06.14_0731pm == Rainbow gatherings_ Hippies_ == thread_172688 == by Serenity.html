				I&#039;m going to the Montana national gathering this year and was wondering if any of you silk roaders were/are rainbow? I think that the rainbow ideas are worth my time and I&#039;m looking forward to &quot;Leaving Babylon&quot; and conversing with people on a different level than I am normally able to.<br /><br /><br />I hope that the rainbows I meet are receptive of the agorist mindset that I&#039;ve come to embrace thanks to the silk road. If we are going to play the game of dollars, i think we all know that you need to play hard and you need to break and bend the rules. For now, money is the way to accomplish things and I think that if rainbows were to apply their mindset to the modern political dollar game with the intention of destroying the dollar game we could do a lot.<br /><br /><br />Even if you aren&#039;t rainbow and don&#039;t consider yourself a hippy, what are your thoughts on how silk road, encryption and agorism affect the future of the human condition?
