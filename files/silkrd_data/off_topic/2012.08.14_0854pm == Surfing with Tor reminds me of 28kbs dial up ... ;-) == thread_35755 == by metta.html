				Also, I tell my friends a Tor Portal is a lot like Yahoo in1998... but with more questionable stuff. ;)<br /><br />The design, simplicity and latency is very characteristic of the early internet though, and it does make my nostalgic. :)<br />

				I must say, after the initial connection to the site is remarkably fast (a lot faster then a couple of months a go). Just switch your Tor identity every now and then when it gets slow. I started using the Internet when 56k modems were the norm and I find that after the initial connect it&#039;s nothing like that. 56k was just slow all the time. 5KB/s whohoo.

				I know hu. It reminds me of when AOL was the shit with my 56k dial up modem and you hear that weird ass sound as you logged on lol. Tor always takes 5mins to launch and it takes another 5 mins for TOR to launch the SR homepage. Surfing any other site is pretty fast though.

				Didn&#039;t even realize what I had in those days. I just knew it was new, cool, fun, and exciting. Fortunately it grew, and grew, and got better, and blossomed into what we have today. Where it continues to evolve and improve. It is great to be alive and living in this day and age.
