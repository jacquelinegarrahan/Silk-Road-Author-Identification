				First time posting hoping to get some answers. <br /><br />So I am in need of some prescription medication, specifically doxycycline (antibiotic). Obviously I was not able to find any kind of meds here on SL. I started considering ordering online from some random Canadian pharmacy but I have no clue as to which sites sell legit/non-fake meds like doxycycline. So my question is, is there a specific site like SL for prescription meds somewhere on the .onion net ? if not, does anyone have positive experience with a canadian pharmacy (that ships to US) that they would recommend ? even if you don&#039;t would you happen to know any legit forums out there that rate international pharmacies ?&nbsp; any help is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />PS - the reason I ask for this med specifically is to treat my dog for heartworms. I already have gone to the vet and they want to rape me with costs upon costs to treat him and a broke university student I cant afford that. There is also no need to worry about dosage, I have friends studying to be vets who will walk me through the treatment. I just gotta find the pills. Thanks!

If all you want to do is find out if X site is legit, no registration is needed. I never even bothered trying to get a referral, especially since I&#039;m not the kind of guy who buys enough from non-established sources that my membership would add anything relevant to the site.
