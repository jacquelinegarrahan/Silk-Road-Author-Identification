				Since ketamine has been made illegal in india the illegal/legal rave scene in the uk has been so much better without it and its going to be so good for the festival scene unlike going to festivals like Frenchtek wheres its a massive k fest normally and its just nasty tbh.<br /><br />Also its such a great thing that mxe is has become banned here now because i know a few people that have died from it, people on it being out of this world on it and almost raping people and also people hurting themselfs and ending up in hospital when theyve not been in this reality there just both dirty drugs imo and even when i did a 10mg bump of mxe i blacked out from it and it was one of the worst feelings ever when i come around.<br /><br />Can get these both so cheap in bulk but a team of us have all refused together to not get this stuff big in the uk again as its just not needed and are putting everyone else off buying it aswell.

				I like a little bump of K now and then but I actually agree with OP. Back in 2007-2009 when we were awash with super cheap K, any rave, free party or club was full of K zombies, lying around drooling with 8 bar dubstep plodding away in the background.<br /><br />Now K has dried up and we&#039;re flooded with good quality MD it&#039;s a delight to go out, lots more house music and techno, no aggro, huggy people, lots more dancing and the night doesn&#039;t die after 3am&nbsp; :D

				Ketamine is still easy to get if you know the right people. <br /><br />It&#039;s a wonderful drug, you just have to take it properly. Like Kitty-Flipping is a great way to bang K. I was on the train back from Fabric on Saturday morning and these little rave-monsters my mate and me started mandy-chatting to on the train were saying they had been taking K and one of them came out with this quote-of-the-year: When you are on K you all the revelations you get make the world make sense. Then when you come down the world goes to shit again and is confusing.<br /><br />And Wowzers I get the squat party reference. You remember the one that was in the news because it was in the mansion?

				In the past I could have had K sent to me in the mail from india. That is what all my friends did. Now I have to get it from the Chinese mafia which costs a lot more the quality is lower because its going from lab to sketchy mafia to me instead of lab to me and in general its a lot worse than grabbing direct from a supplier in india.

The last one I went to (Peak District a few weeks back), 2 middle aged coppers turned up at about 4am, told us to be off the site by midday and clear up and went back and sat in their car in the lane til morning. <br /><br />The best parties by far are in the South West, there&#039;s hardly any clubs down there so there&#039;s a proper DIY scene, even the music&#039;s different from the rest of the country (glitch hop &amp; fidget house). It&#039;s also rural enough that most parties don&#039;t even get noticed. There was a ridiculous one back in 2005 (think it was biohazard running it), went on for 4 days in a little cove which was only accessible when the tide was out. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17944.msg202089#msg202089">Quote from: Limetless on April 22, 2012, 09:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">When you are on K you all the revelations you get make the world make sense.
