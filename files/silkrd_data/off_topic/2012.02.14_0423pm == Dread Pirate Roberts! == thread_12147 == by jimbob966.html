				Thought some people would like to know what this stands for. There&#039;s a great Wiki article on it. <br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_Pirate_Roberts<br /><br />Dread Pirate Roberts<br />Quoted from Wikipedia<br />&quot;At the beginning of The Princess Bride, the only thing known concerning the Dread Pirate Roberts is that he never leaves captives alive.<br />It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who periodically pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor. Everyone except the successor and the former Roberts is then released at a convenient port, and a new crew is hired. The former Roberts stays aboard as first mate, referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;, and thereby establishing the new Roberts&#039; persona. After the crew is convinced, the former Roberts leaves the ship and retires on his earnings.<br />Westley, the hero of The Princess Bride, is on a voyage to seek his fortune when his ship is captured by the Dread Pirate and reported dead.[2] While the other passengers are weeping and offering bribery for their lives, Westley simply asks Roberts to please not kill him. The &quot;please&quot; arousing his interest, Roberts asks, &quot;Why should I make an exception of you?&quot; Westley then explains his mission to get enough money to reunite himself with Buttercup. Westley&#039;s description of Buttercup&#039;s beauty intrigues Roberts to the point that he hires Westley as a personal attendant. While Roberts is continually impressed with Westley&#039;s work, he continues to keep Westley&#039;s future in doubt by saying each night &quot;Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I&#039;ll most likely kill you in the morning.&quot; After about three years, Roberts and Westley have grown close, and Roberts promotes Westley to his second-in-command. Shortly after that, Roberts reveals to Westley that the guise of the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; is merely a nom de guerre that he has inherited. Westley goes on to explain that the method works because Roberts&#039; notorious reputation inspires overwhelming fear in sailors. Ships immediately capitulate and surrender their wealth rather than be captured, a fate they imagine to be certain death. A pirate operating under his own name is said to be incapable of such infamy: &quot;No one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.&quot;

				Always thought DPR was not one person.<br /><br />Maybe he is like a James Bond on drugs.<br /><br />Love to see a fiending Bond - whacking some civilians for the cash then whacking the dealer, making love to his widow and then stealing the widescreen and kids playstations, x boxes and shit.<br /><br />Off topid but back to the article, yes of course, it is relevant.<br /><br />Quite an intellectual love in going on here.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				I find it tickling that the founder of a black market picked his name out of a delightful movie like The Princess Bride, especially as it is only too fitting a name.

				I see it as is. Very legit post.<br />And obviously.. he/she/they know what DPR was.. hence why the picked it.. so there HAS to be relevance. <br /><br />And it&#039;s like the whole Satoshi Nakamoto BtC thing... that he wasn&#039;t one person but a string of people.<br />Just to throw off the average brained person.

				I figured everyone got the reference! ha.&nbsp; well it&#039;s a great movie i&#039;ve seen countless times, but not in the past year or two due to how busy i&#039;ve been.&nbsp; I think i&#039;ll have to make room in my schedule to watch it again.&nbsp; Though i think i can still pretty much quote it from memory.&nbsp; I have an audio-phonic memory.
