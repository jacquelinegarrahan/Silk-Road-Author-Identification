What will then happen is the price of say 1BTC will be become to high for anyone to be willing to pay for and buy to sell on a fluid basis. After this point the BTC will devalue and the market will crash because it will go from a vastly over-inflated value to worthless which is the nature of all market bubbles. The way to maintain the BTC is to allow a steady flow to be produced that wont destabilize the market value but keep the demand for more catered for. <br /><br />If you look at the financial crisis of 2007/2008 you notice that economies that allowed wild speculation and over inflation of the property and debt market crumbled because of the same basic economic theory stated above but those that regulated and kept a stable level of inflation/national debt weren&#039;t hit nearly so hard. If you compare say, the U.K to Switzerland you can see the clear difference.

I can put one anywhere in the world you like so long as you can pay for the commercial shipping (as in a container on a ship). <br /><br />And no it&#039;s not traceable if you buy it with a false identity and have the ID numbers from the car parts machined off. In all honesty if you buy it under a false identity and ship it under a false identity it really doesn&#039;t matter about the ID numbers anyway, can just dump the identity and get another one.
