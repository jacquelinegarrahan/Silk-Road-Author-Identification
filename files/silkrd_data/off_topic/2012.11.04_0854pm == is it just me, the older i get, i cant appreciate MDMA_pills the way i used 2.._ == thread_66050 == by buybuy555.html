				Much agreed. I still Remember my first time doing MDMA, I was about 16 at the time and two caps lasted me from 9pm to 4 am. Now two caps will give me a light buzz for a few hours and barely any feelings of emotion. The last time I dropped was about 4 months ago so hopefully I&#039;m in better shape now.

				I know what you mean by feeling dirty by it, that is how i would explain the feeling right doing it right now. I have abused mdma alot in the past, so maybe we just lost the magic? :(

				&nbsp;:( i think going by the sounds of things it just one of those things that comes with age, like i love puff aswell and thought i would never stop, but a couple of yrs ago i gave it up, and never looked back untill recently, but theres days when i love it, and then the next day i couldnt see it far enuf away, and i was the same with methadrone, it was only last yr i was spending at least £100 a week onit, and when it legal i was buying 2oz at a time, now i hate the stuff, and i treat meth heads like herion addicts, not that iv got anything against H as i smoke it from time to time, but if ur robbin my granny for it that a different story...<br /><br />its good to hear ur views this guys as i thought it was just me +1 to u both for the replies...
