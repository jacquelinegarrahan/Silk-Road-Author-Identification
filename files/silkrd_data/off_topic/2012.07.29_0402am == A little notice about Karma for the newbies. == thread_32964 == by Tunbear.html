				Hi there folks I recently hit full member and can now give karma, and I thought I&#039;d make this thread for users who can&#039;t do so, because hopefully, if you sweated it as much as me, you won&#039;t do afterwards.<br /><br />First off, I believed the karma points were given on a per user basis, and that to add them you had to go in their profile. Because of this I held the karma points in a higher regard than what they deserve, and therefore held users with such and such points in either a high or low standing accordingly.<br /><br />This is not the case. Karma points are awarded per post. Each post has an agree or disagree link underneath - all it takes is a bad post or a bad viewpoint for a user to get a lower rating.<br /><br />To be honest I reckon nobody sweated it as much as me, I was so obsessed with maintaining a good number because I didn&#039;t want anyone to think I could turn out to be a shitty vendor.<br /><br />But just in case anyone was sweating it, I hope this alleviates any fears :)

				Karma can only be given out to a particular user once before a 72-hour wait is imposed upon the giver. A high karma/low discourage does mean that people respect that particular user. After all, only people with 100+ posts can give karma. However, there are ways to game the system if a group of people work together... which is why you&#039;ll sometimes see people with stupidly-high karma that, by all rights, probably don&#039;t deserve it.
