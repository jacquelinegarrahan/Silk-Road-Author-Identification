				I would like to make a topic with teks, tips, products etc needed to lay nbome to blotter paper.<br />There is a lot of information on the internet about this, but certainly not easy to find as is distributed around huge threads about the substances.<br /><br />For what I have been reading the best post I saw about laying blotter was this one:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How to Lay Blotter - Oswley Tek<br /><br />Laying blotter would appear to be a simple process. Determine the retention volume for a blotter sheet. Prepare a solution with about 2-4% more volume than the retention volume of the blotter paper. Soak the blotter in the solution until it is saturated. Allow the blotter to dry. Ready to use!<br /><br />This straightforward concept was purportedly developed in the 1960&#039;s by Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituar ... anley.html) to take advantage of this brand new compound which he was synthesizing that was all the rage, LSD-25. Due to the huge volume of LSD that Bear produced (reputedly in excess of a million doses over 3 years), he needed a simple process to convert the compound into convenient doses. From his efforts came blotter tabs.<br /><br />His production process for these tabs was based on the very simple approach outlined above. The LSD solution was prepared in very highly purified distilled water (he found that chlorine and other chemicals destroyed the potency of his product), he then placed the blotter in a plastic bag, poured in the LSD solution, allowed it to soak for a period of time, and then removed the wet blotter sheet from the bag and allowed the blotter to dry flat in a dark location (away from the sun and fluorescent lights).<br /><br />The simplicity of this approach, which is followed to this day for laying Acid blotter, works well because of one major fact - the D/R (dose-response) curve (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose-response_relationship) for LSD is extremely benign, i.e. higher doses while more intense, and not generally a lot more intense. Furthermore, the toxic threshold for LSD is extremely high (there has never been a death directly attributed to toxicity of LSD to my knowledge). All of this allows the significant shortcomings of the previously described approach to be ignored. The basic known shortcomings with this process all relate to uneven distribution of the compound among the tabs on the blotter sheet as a result of two major issues - uneven fluid retention over the surface of the blotter, and uneven evaporation of the solvent over the surface during the drying process, leading to migration of the remaining concentrated solution and resulting in locations with much higher concentration. Even when the user is aware of both issues the problems still cannot easily be addressed or mitigated.<br /><br />Laying Blotter TEK 1<br /><br />Process #1 - This is simply Bear&#039;s process (giving full credit!). As I outlined above, it is only suitable for compounds possessing a benign D/R. Here is the problem - to the best of my knowledge LSD is the only generally available compound with this property. All of the other extremely potent compounds (DOx, NBOMe, FLYs, etc) do NOT share this property. So, in the interests of Harm Reduction, I ask that people never consider this process for those compounds, but only for LSD when using small blotter tabs (1/4” to 1/2” square). If you plan to use large blotter tabs (3/4” to 1” square) this technique can be applied to the NMOBes and some FLYs, but is not recommended for the DOx and BDF.<br /><br />1. Determine the number of tabs on the blotter sheet - The perfing schedule (number of tabs per sheet) will allow you to know the number of doses per sheet. Let&#039;s assume that the perfing schedule provides 14x14 tabs, for a total of 196.<br /><br />2. Determine the retention volume of the blotter sheet - The retention volume is the amount of liquid that can be supported by the absorptive properties of the sheet against the force of gravity. The process uses the chosen solvent (most often distilled water or alcohol). The DRY blotter sheet is weighed (generally requires a balance with 0.01 gram sensitivity). This blotter sheet is then over-saturated with the solvent for about 5 minutes, then picked up by a corner and allowed to drip off the excess solvent for about 30-60 seconds (when solvent drips occur a few seconds apart), and the thoroughly soaked blotter sheet is then weighed again. The difference between the two weights (After-Before) is the weight of solvent retained. Let&#039;s assume for this exercise that the sheet retained 30.80 grams of solvent.<br /><br />3. Selecting the desired dosage - Choose the dosage that you want each tab to deliver. For this exercise let&#039;s assume that we want 200ug of Acid for each tab.<br />(Note: From this point forward proper safety equipment [gloves, safety glasses, and respirator] is absolutely required)<br /><br />4. Making the soaking solution - The blotter soaking solution needs to have 200ug x 196 x 1.03 = 40,376ug or 40.372mg of LSD (the 1.03 factor is for the 3% excess, midway between 2% and 4%) and this needs to be dissolved in 30.8 * 1.03 = 31.72 grams of pure solvent (distilled water) (again, 1.03 is for the 3% excess). We dissolve the acid in the water with stirring until it is completely dissolved.<br /><br />5. Soaking the blotter – Place the dry blotter in a ziplock plastic bag slightly larger than the blotter sheet and slowly the pour in the soaking solution, trying to distribute the solution over most of the blotter. After completing this then attempt to seal the bag in a way to limit the amount of air remaining. Allow to sit on a horizontal surface in the dark for about 5 minutes to distribute evenly.<br /><br />6. Drying the blotter – Carefully remove the soaked blotter from the plastic bag and hold by the corner to allow excess solution to drip off the blotter and back into the bag. When the drip rate from the soaked blotter is one drop every few seconds place the wet blotter on a drying rack (consisting of plastic-headed pins stuck into a flat piece of wood), and put the assembly in a dark location (away from the sun and fluorescent lights) with good ventilation and allow to dry completely (several hours to a day, depending on air movement, temperature, and relative humidity).<br /><br />Laying Blotter TEK 2<br /><br />Process #2 – This alternative process is a highly accurate way to provide dosage on blotters, albeit requiring more effort for preparation. Most importantly, this process is suitable for all compounds, regardless of the D/R curves, since it does not suffer from problems related to the inhomogeneity of blotter material or the other issues mentioned above. This process requires the acquisition of at least one highly specialized piece of laboratory equipment, a brand-new variable volume (adjustable) micropipette (something in the range of 0-100ul or so) that uses disposable plastic tips. These are not too expensive. With the use of additional, even more highly specialized equipment the process can be sped up substantially, but that is not the purpose of this TEK.<br /><br />The basic process is the placement of very small, but highly accurate, amounts of solution on each tab. The amount of solution dispensed is selected to not permit the total soaking of the tab, but rather to only soak the very center of the absorbent blotter tab. When done this way, using the proper equipment, the user can be quite certain that each tab contains the exact amount of material desired, to very high accuracy and reproducibility.<br /><br />1. Determine the number of tabs on the blotter sheet- The perfing schedule (number of tabs per sheet) will allow you to know the number of doses per sheet. Let&#039;s assume that the perfing schedule provides 14x14 tabs, for a total of 196.<br /><br />2. Determine the retention volume of the blotter sheet - The retention volume is the amount of liquid that can be supported by the absorptive properties of the sheet against the force of gravity. The process uses the chosen solvent (most often distilled water). The DRY blotter sheet is weighed (generally requires a balance with 0.01 gram sensitivity). This blotter sheet is then over-saturated with the solvent for about 5 minutes, then picked up by a corner and allowed to drip off the excess solvent for about 30-60 seconds (when solvent drips occur a few seconds apart), and the thoroughly soaked blotter sheet is then weighed again. The difference between the two weights (After-Before) is the weight of solvent retained. Let&#039;s assume for this exercise that the sheet retained 30.80 grams of solvent. Since this is water, 1 gram is almost 1 ml, or, more exactly, 1 gram = 1/0.9975 = 1.0025 ml @ 23 degrees C (about 73F). See http://www2.volstate.edu/CHEM/Density_of_Water.htm for the density of water at other temperatures. (BTW, the density of pure ethanol and various ethanolic solutions with water can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_(data_page) and the best data for acetone can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone, but it lacks variation of density with temperature)<br /><br />Either:<br /><br />3. Calculate the tab “dispensed volume” limit – Divide the volume of solvent (30.80 grams) by the number of tabs in the sheet (196) to get the maximum volume of solvent that can be absorbed per tab. So 30.80 / 196 = 0.157ml or 157ul. The dispensed volume should therefore be in the range of 20% to 35% of the saturation limit for the tab, or 31ul to 55ul. 40ul would seem about right.<br /><br />Or<br /><br />3. Determine the “dispensed volume” limit visually – Prepare 5ml of solvent with a drop or two of food color added (assuming it dissolves. If not, there are many organic-soluble dyes that can be used for organic solvents. Select one of them.). Take your adjustable micropipette and set the dispensed volume to 10ul, fill the tip and dispense the 10ul onto the center of blotter tab, just touching the tab lightly during dispensing. Adjust the micropipette to dispense 15ul and repeat the process on a new blotter tab. Continue the process, increasing the dispensed volume in 5ul steps, until the spot starts approaching the perf edges. Allow all the spots to dry. Now examine the spots (looking at both sides of the blotter tab) and determine the dispensed volume that leaves a spot that has plenty of margin surrounding it and is not even close to the perfs. That is your maximum dispensed volume.<br /><br />(Note: From this point forward proper safety equipment [gloves, safety glasses, and respirator] is absolutely required)<br /><br />4. Preparing the solution for dispensing – We need to calculate the amount of compound to dissolve in the chosen solvent. Let’s assume that we decided that proper dispensed volume for the specific blotter tabs that we have is 40ul, and the solvent is water. And let’s assume that you want to dose 500ug of your favorite compound in each tab. So we need 196 (tabs) x 40ul x 1.03 (3% extra) x 0.9975 (density of water @ 23C) = 8.055 grams of water. Into this dissolve 196 (tabs) x 500ug x 1.03 (3% extra) / 0.99 (assuming that the compound is 99% pure for this example) = 101.96mg of compound. Remember, the solvent must completely dissolve all of the compound! I also recommend that you add a very small amount of food coloring to the solution. (See next section for explanation)<br /><br />5. Dispensing the solution onto the blotter tabs – The key for this portion of the process is to accurately dispense the 40ul of solution onto each tab, but making sure that each tab only gets one dispensing. This is the rationale for the small bit of food color added to the solution in the previous step – to help the user see that a tab (in both the wet and dry state) has been already been dispensed, and prevent the potential for “double dosing”. Take your adjustable micropipette and set the dispensed volume to 40ul, fill the tip and dispense the 40ul onto the center of blotter tab, just touching the tab lightly during dispensing. Repeat the process until all tabs have been dosed.<br /><br />6. Drying the blotter – Put the blotter sheet into a dark location (away from the sun and fluorescent lights) with good ventilation and allow to dry completely (several hours to a day, depending on air movement, temperature, and relative humidity).<br /><br />The End !

Which micropipette would be better for dosing the blotters ? Which speed rate is attainable if someone here has tried ?<br />Best form of 25x-nbomes to be laid without being complexed ? HCl or some other salt ?<br /><br />Thanks.&nbsp; :D
