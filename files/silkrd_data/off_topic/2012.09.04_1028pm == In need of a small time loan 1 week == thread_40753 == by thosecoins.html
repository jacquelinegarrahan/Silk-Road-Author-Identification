				I was offering for under 0.1 though other people were offering more. When you ask for as much money as some really small orders instead of just enough to fix a bitcoin transfer miscalculation (as was in my case), you should have some sort of reputation to back it up.<br /><br />Post more and maybe tell why you need it. Maybe several people would give you a portion of it to spread the risk in case you intend never to pay back.<br /><br />Best of luck.&nbsp; ;)

My rate would be 800%, meaning for a 0.5 BTC loan you would need to pay back 4 BTC.

				The way I see it if the OP agrees to 800% interest they have no intention of actually paying back the loan in the first place.<br /><br />If any of you have seen me around you&#039;ll know I HATE begging threads - people who expect others to pay for their drugs really grate on me.<br />This person has contributed absolutely nothing to this community and yet expects someone to just give them money with the promise that they&#039;ll pay the lender back. The account was seemingly registered for the sole purpose of getting Bitcoin from someone with no intention of paying them back as the poster has not posted anywhere else on the forums.<br /><br />Actually I think I&#039;ll change the rules up a bit: OP, if you&#039;re looking for a loan, you have to send me 50% of the loan amount that you&#039;re looking for first as a &#039;consideration fee&#039;. If you only need X amount of Bitcoin to complete a transfer then you&#039;ll have 50% of what you&#039;re short in your account. When you send it to me, I&#039;ll consider your application. It&#039;s entirely likely that I&#039;ll refuse the loan and keep the consultation fee, but hey, no risk no reward right?<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Try to get a smaller order. <br /><br />I literately just placed an order and I was like .17 btc short for how many I wanted, so I sucked it up and ordered one less.<br /><br />Just try to find a listing with a lessened weight/qty.

				Hello Lovestotrip - aka wtfnoob aka asshat aka moonjuice,<br /><br />How&#039;s things? Seems like your little scams aren&#039;t working anymore :(<br />Don&#039;t ever ask the pot for a loan again with a new account that has only ever begged for BTC.<br />Come back on your 15th birthday and we&#039;ll buy you a cake, how&#039;s that?<br /><br />Well, at least you gave me a chuckle for the night.<br /><br />Much love,<br />At.<br />
