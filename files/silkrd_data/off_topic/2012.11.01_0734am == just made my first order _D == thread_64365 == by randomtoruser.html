				Not that you have any real reason to be worried but... that was sort of a high risk item to be starting out with. Dutchaanbod seems like a trustworthy vendor though (if a bit slow), so I imagine there&#039;s a great than 95% chance you get it. That being said, international success rates are entirely dependent on the competency of individual vendors and not necessarily their country of origin, so proceed with caution.

				I wont go into specifics but my first international order was worth the extra wait and so far haven&#039;t lost an order. I do a ton of research and if the deal sounds to good I just don&#039;t do it.
