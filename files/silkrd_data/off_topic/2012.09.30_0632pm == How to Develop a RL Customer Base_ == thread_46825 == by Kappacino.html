				Well through a bit of luck and living in the world, I&#039;ve run into an old friend who grows and can do me ounces for about £90-100 a time. Standard street price is £160 but no-one does a 3.5g 8th on the street so I can probably milk about £200 per Oz whilst still giving a decent amount, at least more than what most people would give (In the UK that&#039;s about 2.2-2.5g for an &quot;8th&quot;)<br /><br />Now I could sell on SR but tbh there aren&#039;t that many UK weed vendors and I&#039;d probably have a lot of work to do to keep up with orders if I was offering a price anything less than absurd (which is what the prices are now), and I&#039;m already insanely busy as is and don&#039;t have the time to do all the prep/check orders etc/siphon bitcoins etc. <br /><br />But this is a connect that will be in place for some time so all I need to do is establish a solid customer base and I can just have this on the side to make a little extra cash. Not trying to become a massive dealer or anything, but if I had 15-20 people who are at least semi regular I think that should be fine.<br /><br />I&#039;ve thought about approaching people that look like they&#039;re into weed. No offense to anyone, I know there are many people who blaze that you&#039;d never guess but if you see the guy with the huge dreadlocks, a rasta hat, and a pink floyd t-shirt it&#039;s a safe bet he&#039;s a toker. Then again, it&#039;s also a safe bet that he has a dealer. So really I&#039;m at a loss.<br /><br />I did think about leaving some business cards just with a weed logo and a throwaway pay as you go number around the city, which could work, but at the same time if some anti-drug fag finds it they could report it to the police and that&#039;s a pretty easy sting to set up. I know a lot of people who smoke and I&#039;m into that whole scene but most people aren&#039;t really looking for a new dealer. Many people are hearing about silk road as well so really I need to find people that are noobish/get shit deals which involves being proactive, but really I can&#039;t afford to get arrested in the process.<br /><br />Any tips from those that have done it?

				Just do your fellow UKers a favor and sell on SR strictly.&nbsp; Learn to package and ship.&nbsp; Probably gonna be easier than dealing in real life.

				If you can get bulk just unload it onto smaller dealers, let them mess about with it. <br />I miss the days good old days of 8ths, now its all .8-9 for £10 bullshit.<br />The thing with stoners and good weed is they will come back for more.

				You just need to go bar hopping a few times man. Use common sense about it and just listen to people talk. If you have some trusted people you know then get them to help you out with it. That would be best just to use your well known friends. I know you&#039;d like to get 15 or 20 new buyers over night but that just isn&#039;t sensible. That is a fast way to the pen. Building real life customers takes time and finess. You may need to throw a few parties

				If I was a dealer, I&#039;d strictly stick to SR and sell things in powder or blotter forms for stealth shipping.<br /><br />SR really built a great system that protects both vendors and buyers.<br /><br />You don&#039;t know what kind of shitheads you will run into if you deal in real life.

				if you&#039;re into a music scene then start telling people who you&#039;ve seen around at other shows that you&#039;ve got weed.&nbsp; or if you live near a college try hanging out with the hackey sack crew for a few minutes and tell them you &quot;know a guy&quot; who can get weed. <br /><br />other than that, it sounds like you don&#039;t have a close group of friends who are all looking for weed so you&#039;re kinda shit outta luck.&nbsp; 15-20 people is a LOT of weed customers to find and would probably take a few years if you&#039;re not in college or friends with all the ravers.<br /><br />i tried doing this myself, just cuz i had such a surplus of weed and hash from going bitcoin crazy on SR.&nbsp; without giving away too much of my identity, lets just say its very obvious by the way i look that i&#039;m a stoner who is probably holding.&nbsp; so i rode my bike up and down the beach a few times this summer asking high schoolers, surfers, black people, juggalos, bikers, and even some dude-bros, if they needed weed and the most I got was a few people who wanted my number but never called.&nbsp; 90% of the people i asked pulled a nancy reagan on me and just said &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp; so i just smoked all that shit myself and got a little more conservative with my SR orders.&nbsp; it was a blessing, i&#039;m sure, cuz dealing in person is a very dangerous activity.
