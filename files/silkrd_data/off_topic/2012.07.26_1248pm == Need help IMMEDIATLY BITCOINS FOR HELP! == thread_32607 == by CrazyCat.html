				Unless you&#039;re putting us on, which is possible, I hope you get caught real soon by the police. Thieves and other kinds of evil characters have no place here. This is a community of libertarian-minded drug-friendly people, not hardened criminals.<br /><br />BB

				GTFO asshole. If that person is still alive, there is no way you&#039;re going to get away with it. That kind of money doesn&#039;t just stop coming in. Within a couple months he&#039;ll have more, and hunt you down.

				You&#039;re not going to get very far.<br />I can&#039;t speak for everyone, but I&#039;m pretty sure I would notice $500k + missing from my bank account.<br /><br />In regards to how to proceed..I can&#039;t help you, in fact, more than likely nobody here will. We&#039;re not fond of these types of activities nor the people who engage in them. You may want to try the hidden wiki for links to other places that may help you, but I can&#039;t vouch for any of them.<br /><br />sdesu

				Why don&#039;t you call at his house and offer to secure his crappy WEP encrypted wifi network for Â£50 instead of downloading everything from his shitty old Windows XP machine? While you&#039;re there convince him to upgrade his computer, you can supply it at a fee and set it up for a modest fee... Rinse and repeat and you are earning your own money.
