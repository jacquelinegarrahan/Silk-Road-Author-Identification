				Hello : )<br /><br />Not being suicidal at the moment. However, I like to feel safe as having a plan B when things don&#039;t work out as I&#039;m planning. If you have any advice against suicide, please save it. I&#039;m pro choice. I wasn&#039;t asked whether I wanted to be born or not. I wasn&#039;t asked if I wanted to be a human or a duck or a giraffe. At least I can feel some sort of control knowing that I can exit when I want to.<br /><br />Having that said, I need an advice on the type of drugs you think is effective?<br /><br />I&#039;ve read about fentanyl injectable. Not sure how much the dose though?<br /><br />Also read about MDPV? recommendations about the dose are highly appreciated :)<br /><br /><br />Please don&#039;t make wild suggestions as Cyanide or Scopolamine. I need something that is widely available and can easily obtained off silkroad. <br /><br /><br />Apologize if this post has been repeated. Please post the link if you came across similar threads. <br /><br />Thanks in advance&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				Sent you a pm :)<br /><br />Cyanide would probably be lethal but also very painful. It is not recommended by any right to die societies due to this. Obviously that would be up to you if you are concerned with having a painless / peaceful death or not.

				If i remember correctly there is potassium cyanide for sale on the road. - Not encouraging/condoning anything btw man. If you are thinking what it sounds like, i most definitely am not recommending you do anything about it. but hey? who am i to tell you what to do.<br /><br />Take it easy dude

				i&#039;m not advising cyanide, just pointing out that it is available on here. everyone should do their own research on the effects on such things and this guy seems like a forward thinker so i&#039;m sure he will.

				Maybe fentanyl would be the best choice for ease of transition. I really would not know but just giving my two cents, fentanyl sure sounds better then cyanide. Though cyanide is probably more suited to the job, and a fentanyl OD probably isnt as pleasant as it sounds (not that it sounds all that pleasant), OD effectively means too much, and too much is never good, thats why they call it too much. Or maybe try and find pentobarbital, if its good enough for US prisons its good enough for us. Find something to suppress your cns, mainly respiratory functions, as i imagine you&#039;d simply drift off. <br /><br />If you have a few thousand to spare and wouldnt mind using that to aid you in your journey. Contact dignitas clinic, they will handle everything with the highest dignity possible for a small fee. <br /><br />Or, i dunno, dont do any of the above and go by some puppies and reinact the scene from family guy where peters rolling around on the floor with a load of lil puppies<br />

				In the extensive research done for a banned pro-choice book named &#039;The peaceful pill handbook&#039; it labels Pentobarbital the best euthanasia medication. Haven&#039;t yet seen it on SR or BMR but it&#039;s obtainable OTC from veterinarians in Tijuana. <br /><br />Potassium Cyanide isn&#039;t going to be a pleasant exit - listen to the Jonestown death tape for proof...<br /><br />We would go with heroin/benzo combination OD or if one were to use a pistol, it should be placed against the roof of their mouth.

				i say order some DMT of SR, get somewhere as calm as you can, or out in nature. Put around 40-60mg in a pipe on top of some herbal mixture, take 3 or 4 deep lungfuls of it, have a breakthrough, then re evaluate, Everything, it won&#039;t take long. Please don&#039;t knock it if you haven&#039;t tried it.&nbsp; If you need to talk please send me a message. Love &amp; Light to you

				I recommend avoiding suicide ideation entirely. Taking mild hallucinogenics can help you change perspective. Or exercise and very hot baths.<br /><br />Depression is perfectly natural, it exists to help you, by deterring you from risk taking. That&#039;s the reason why a lot of people find they become low without a seemingly rational reason. Everything is going great for them more or less, and then suddenly pow. This is your body telling you to slow down before you burnout. A good way to avoid melancholy is to become angry. Anger encourages risk taking behavior and is a great motivator for destructive or, less well appreciated, constructive behavior. <br /><br />Fact is: Nobody who was happy with their lives has ever changed the world. If you&#039;re happy, the status quo is good for you. Logically happy people are also useless people. People need problems to encourage them to strive onwards and upwards so much that we invented an economic system that generates them for us in the form of recessions. If you don&#039;t believe that, look at what happens when average people have everything they could reasonably want. Mid-life crises all over the place, or obsessions with completely irrelevant bullshit.<br /><br />Further to that, the idea that happiness is the purpose of life is a pernicious and simple minded lie. If we wanted to be happy until death we&#039;d inject a lifetime supply of dopamine and serotonin into our veins. There would be watch-like gadgets for that purpose on everybody&#039;s wrists. We don&#039;t, or only take substances that encourage such chemical release occasionally with periods of non-use because we know to be permanently happy would be awful. The purpose of life is to do things worth being happy about.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I wasn&#039;t asked if I wanted to be a human or a duck or a giraffe.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I want to become a platypus.

Thanks for that beautiful, succinct post. i feel we share some of the same ideas about life, the highs and lows are reality in this life, could we know one without knowing the other? you covered so much in those few paragraphs-your a light werker is what you are pine :) , go4green, read ALL of the responses to your request, pines suggestion about not dwelling or giving constant thought to suicide-thought is energy and what you visualize and put energy into will manifest itself, pines suggestion&nbsp; about hallucinogens, mine about dmt, will remove some of the conditioning that society has laid down, you might gain insight in areas previously not thought of and understand situations and events from a different perspective.

				You consider posting what is going on with you that you feel the need for an exit plan.<br /><br />I swear it is not a lecture but I assume you would prefer to live if your problems can be solved or suffering eased some.<br /><br />It doesn&#039;t hurt you in any way to share what is causing you such distress and may do you a great deal of good. You can always make that decision if you can&#039;t solve your problems. <br /><br />My life has become shit. So I know what pain is both physical and emotional and I do understand how you feel but would like to understand why. <br /><br />I am not suggesting my pain is worse than yours or anything like that. Like I said I have no intention of lecturing or trying to deter you from whatever choice you make. But, just maybe there are other options you have not thought of. <br /><br /><br />
