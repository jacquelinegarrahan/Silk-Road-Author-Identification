				$16 for a fucking 10mg watson?<br /><br />REALLY?<br /><br />What&#039;s with the opiate vendors??!??!?!?!<br /><br />When I used to be involved in illegal activities I could get them for $1 per pill if I bought 100(locally)....<br /><br /><br />but really what the shit is with the prices in the opioid section really guys? WAYYYYYYYYYYYY over priced....<br /><br /><br />Damn I leave silk for a month and come back and this place is a shit hole.

				professortwakt or something to that effect has them right now for around 6 a 10mg yellow watson which is about as competitive as I have ever seen on here. Ancientlib will also usually have them 5 for 25 when she has them in stock and vicowat usually has the generics for about 8 bucks a pill which. I have ordered from all 3 (just placed yesterday with professor) and it is already in transit so get in while you can. <br /><br />If people are actually buying 1 pill for 16 bucks they are fucking idiot. Noone with an opiate tolerance can get an enjoyable high off 1 pill.&nbsp;

They can afford to pay outrageous opioids prices because they have substantial bitcoin holdings that they spent very little to acquire.<br /><br />Honestly ALL the drugs on here are overpriced by a factor of like 400% compared to street prices, besides cannabis.

				In order for me to make any money and justify my method of packaging, I have to get at least 7 or 8 per pill.&nbsp; I can do bulk discounts, but triple vacuum seal, triple envelope, Priority mail + dnc clean, usable drop return address, forensically safe packaging... This all costs money, supplies, equipment, etc.<br /><br />Im not gonna toss a bottle of pills in and padded envelop and be done...If I am going to do it, I am going to do it right.<br /><br />The cost of getting what you want without your ass leaving your chair ;)

I&#039;ve paid that price on several occasions and was happy with it, and I think others should be as well. Anything over 10 however is unjustifiable.

				Opiates are my DOC and I fully realize that prices vary depending on your location, but some of the listings on here are just INSANE. Who pays over $1 per mg for fucking hydrocodone? I just don&#039;t get it.
