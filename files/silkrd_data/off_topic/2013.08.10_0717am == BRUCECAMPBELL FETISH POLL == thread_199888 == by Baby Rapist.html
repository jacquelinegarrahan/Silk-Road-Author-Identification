I hope you enjoyed all the puns in that sentence, because they were meant to foreshadow what I am about to share: you can purchase poop online.<br /><br />For about $30, depending on the what kind of excrement you choose, ShitSenders.com will anonymously deliver your choice of&nbsp; cow, gorilla or elephant shit to the stupid ex, evil boss, annoying neighbor or asshole frenemy of your choosing. The site’s tagline says it well: “Has some one really pissed you off? Don’t get mad, GET EVEN. Send that special some one a big stinky pile of shit.”<br /><br />Anonymous of Harrisburg, PA writes:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Greatest gag gift ever. I sent one to my jackass brother in law and the whole family found out about it and they are all teasing him. He dosen’t know who it came from. He’s so pissed off it’s great. It makes for charming Sunday dinner conversation.”<br /><br />This is more or less the modern version of prank calling, tee-peeing or leaving a flaming bag of poop on your enemies’ doorstep — all of which were very popular methods of revenge in the ’80s. I never was bold enough to do the flaming poop bag thing, but after I saw “Can’t Buy Me Love,” I always dreamed of doing it. I did more of the prank calling and tee-peeing than I care to admit. But I imagine anything involving poop would have been more satisfying. Now revenge is all Facebook stalking and Twitter wars and naked photo leaking. Let’s get back to revenge basics with POOP! Hmmm. I can think of a few people who deserve to get a shit package from me.<br /><br />[The Daily Dot]<br />[Shit Senders]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195527.msg1409775#msg1409775">Quote from: BruceCampbell on August 04, 2013, 03:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195527.msg1409745#msg1409745">Quote from: russianundergroundrap on August 04, 2013, 03:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Shut the fuck up and do some drugs you pussy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Stexo is more of an asset to the community than a drug addicted shit muffin scammer fuck such as yourself.

Ladies and gentlemen, mods and admins, I am asking you to read this exchange between us and advise me as to if I am permitted to send this individual a bag of dog shit. After he stopped commenting, I saw him post in the +karma thread. I then looked at some of his posts. I would like you to look at his profile and his recent posts and tell me he isn&#039;t a scammer or a bottom-feeding fucktard worthy of being sterilized for the greater good of humanity. This is my stand against fucktards. #opdogshittacos <br /><br />This dude is getting a bag of dog shit sent to him if a mod or admin can comment as to if I&#039;m allowed. If I can&#039;t do it personally I will literally use the send shit in the mail service on the internet with a prepaid card considering he &quot;gave&quot; me his address for correspondence out of escrow and unsolicited. Thus in my opinion I am not breaking any rules. If he would give me the address unsolicited for xanax and permit me to send him correspondence, then I should certainly be able to send him dog shit. (I intend to include a Xanax bar if it helps)&nbsp; <br /><br />Message Title: 2mg Xanax bars<br /><br />yo sup bro hows your day going Bruce Campbell?<br /><br />can you let me try a few bars?<br /><br />I spent over 2,500$USD on silk road and been here for 2 years.<br /><br />can you front me 5-10 and I will pay you next week on Tuesday?<br /><br />let me know bro<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />i3lazd<br /><br /><br />if you can send me a few bars white send it to:<br /><br />(redacted)<br /><br />looking to get 300 2mg xanax bars need bulk<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: Fail<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />I am well. Thanks for asking.<br /><br />Normally I don&#039;t answer these type of messages, but you caught me at a time when I&#039;m willing to answer one.<br /><br />First, let me point out what I have written on my vendor page:<br /><br />&quot;Messages asking for freebies, samples or solicitation in general will not be read/replied to. Samples are announced in the forum and there is an established list of reviewers/samplers. You probably aren&#039;t one of them.&quot;<br /><br />So, quite obviously the answer to your inquiry is a resounding &quot;fuck no... why in the fuck would you even expect a reply from such an extremely retarded request or even ask if you are capable of reading the English language?&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;ve been a buyer on Silk Road for two years and have spent your entire accumulated amount in less than a month on several occasions. Do you want a cookie?<br /><br />I&#039;m not doing business with a potential customer who will send me their address unsolicited and unencrypted and blatantly violate my terms of service and waste my time, let alone send you free drugs. I&#039;ve taken the liberty of adding you to the vendor blacklist.<br /><br />Have a nice day,<br /><br />Bruce <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: ur cool<br /><br />your cool...<br /><br />I could have made u a lot of $$$ but forget it.<br /><br />I would encrypt but I do not have time. I got 10 different addresses to send to.<br /><br />later bro thanks for your nice letter =P<br /><br />i3lazd<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: Fail #2<br /><br />I am cool. I certainly have a fuckton of Xanax and assorted drugs. Certainly more than you have.<br /><br />I can make myself a lot of $ $ $.<br /><br />Cool beans. 10 addresses and 2k spent? Seems a bit like bullshit considering I don&#039;t have near that many shipping addresses and I&#039;m a fucking drop shipper...<br /><br />Lol. Fuck off dude. You brought my response upon yourself by asking me a stupid fucking question that I clearly have written on my profile not to ask and it got you put on the vendor blacklist for wasting my time.<br /><br />I don&#039;t sell bulk Xanax anyway. I&#039;m sure you can find another vendor to complete your order, but considering you sound like a 15 year old kid trying to get free Xanax bars bragging about your piddly ass buyer stats I doubt it.<br /><br />Best of luck in your endeavors,<br /><br />Bruce<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: ur a g00n<br /><br />i am on xanax haha just playin bro....<br /><br />im 22 years old bro<br /><br /><br />laterz nigga ass bitch<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: Fail #3<br /><br />This isn&#039;t a threat or anything, but I&#039;d shut the fuck up considering you sent your name, address, and age to an internet drug dealer and psychopath. I don&#039;t give a flying fuck if you&#039;re on Xanax, message me or disrespect me again and I&#039;ll mail you a bag of dog shit with a Xanax bar in it.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: Fail #3<br /><br />alright fuck you fag it not my address.<br /><br />bitch ass nigger Bruce Campell a pussy!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Message Title: Fail #4<br /><br />Lol. Good luck placing an order from your buyer account in the near future. You have been added to the vendor blacklist and I&#039;ve copied your PM&#039;s for all my vendor buddies in the private forum.<br /><br />BIG BADASS CUSTOMER OVER HERE BEGGING FOR FREE XANAX EVERYONE! 10 shipping addresses AND 2500 spent?<br /><br />Are you Tony Montana?<br /><br />Get a job fucker.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193157.msg1409764#msg1409764">Quote from: BruceCampbell on August 04, 2013, 03:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=193157.msg1409739#msg1409739">Quote from: 88fxstc on August 04, 2013, 03:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Dogshit is too impersonal.<br />Send him your shit, tell him it&#039;s the best Opium around and the high hits harder when eaten...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But they can do testing on my turds to get a genetic match.
