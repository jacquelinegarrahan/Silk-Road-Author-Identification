				Greetings Friends of the Underground ...<br /><br />A very alarming predatory experience just occurred hours ago to my ex-girlfriend out in Los Angeles. She just sent me an email describing her ordeal and it sort of blew my mind for moments ultimately leading me to post the information here to hopefully help enlighten my brothers and sisters of the underground to this bizarre and scary SCAM.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />My ex-girlfriend&#039;s direct account of the situation as follows:<br /><br />&quot;Hey, I wanted to alert you to a crazy scam. I received a phone call this morning from someone claiming to be Special Agent John Lewis with the DEA. He said they had just issued a warrant for my arrest and that U.S. Marshals would be coming to my home to arrest me today. He claimed there was a package intercepted at customs that was addressed to me and contained illegal pharmaceuticals. Naturally, I freaked out and contacted an attorney friend who alerted to me to the scam. The caller phoned from 202-239-0334. He didn&#039;t ask me for money, but he did suggest that if I cooperate with their investigation that I could get off with just a fine. I feel like an idiot for originally believing this could be real, but the guy seemed to know a lot of information about me and I fell for it! Read more about the scam at the link below.&quot;<br /><br />http://claycord.com/2012/01/12/scam-alert-phone-call-from-the-dea/<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />Well, how about that crazy shit? The reason I am posting it here on our beloved community is that imagine how many of us SR members would completely freak out if we received a call like this one. Fake or not and purposeful or not, this SCAM directly targets our lifestyles. Please help spread the word about these assholes pretending to be DEA agents. Especially within our community. <br /><br />Eat the Rich !!!

				It&#039;s pretty obvious that an agent isn&#039;t going to call you and tell you, &quot;Hey bud, just wanted to let you know you&#039;re getting arrested today.&quot;<br /><br />Everyone would run at that point.

				Sure. I agree with you on that perspective. However, I know there are still folks out there that would fall for it. Or at minimum be scared to death. Especially if they were already awaiting packages. Just trying to help spread the word. The scam seems extremely moronic to me personally. Not to mention that if the scammers get caught impersonating federal law enforcement officers, they will face some ugly jail time. With this considered, the whole things is crazy to me.

				And then you call the police up and setup a sting. Scammer comes by, gets 10-20 for impersonating an officer.
