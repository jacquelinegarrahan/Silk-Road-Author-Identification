				You will know because when you pull back there won&#039;t be an air gap and the syringe will keep getting more filled with liquid due to your blood mixing with your dark colored heroin.<br /><br />I never have seen dope that dark in a syringe. I would advise getting a micron filter that sounds nasty or just buy some good number 4.

				Yah, I know how shitty it is to miss especially if you are addicted and you don&#039;t get the rush but miss. It isn&#039;t like you can reload the same shot and try again, because you know the rush won&#039;t even be close to as it would of been if you hit the first time, and lets face it the rush is damn near the whole reason why you fixed another shot anyways.... It&#039;s enough to make you cry.

				lol monk feels me<br /><br />hoffa, i have citric to break it down but that&#039;s not making it any lighter. i&#039;m locked in my room now and i&#039;ve decided to just keep trying until i get it. <br /><br />is there any point snorting it? will it work or is that an insanely stupid way to do h? <br /><br />i&#039;ve read so many things about smoking it and it just seems like i&#039;ll really fuck that up. smoking it is out of the question for me.

				I suggest tying&nbsp; off so your veins are bulging and when you stick that sucker in there you will know for sure you hit just by the feeling of it popping in.
