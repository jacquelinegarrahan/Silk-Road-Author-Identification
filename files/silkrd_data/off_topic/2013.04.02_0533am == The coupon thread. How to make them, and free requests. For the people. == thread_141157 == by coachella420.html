				Decent post I guess but I have no idea why you would want to spend a countless amount of hours putting together your own personalized coupon stash when you can go on SR, spend $40 and get literally a whole archive, which is constantly updated and maintained. <br /><br />With all the hours you spend making your own and updating them, you could just work 4hrs at a job paying 10$ an hour and be able to afford something that maintains, updates, takes request, and it something that has one thing that this guide will never have.....<br /><br />A community, 120+ pages of information on how to use, where to use, what works, what&#039;s not working, what&#039;s on the watch list all kinds of good stuff..<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, maybe it&#039;s just me, but I think that a certain vendor of coupons pissed you off just enough (justifiably) for you to make this thread. With your only claimed intention being &quot;helping people for free&quot; <br /><br />I don&#039;t think this is the case at all, I think that you are taking something that one of the vendors here taught you, giving someone else&#039;s guide as a coverup, and only hoping to drive business away from that vendor.<br /><br />Now I could be totally wrong &amp; I expect you to defend yourself as anyone would... Maybe you truly do want to just help folks for free, but I will say this.<br /><br />&nbsp;No matter what guide you post it will never equate to the enormousness of help that is the unmentioned vendor I refer to above&#039;s &quot;review thread&quot; or community as we call it over there.
