				Everybody knows that eating morphine is a total waste, inject them or don&#039;t bother. I have cooked and banged hundreds of both types, the Mallies and the Endos, this is how to do the Endos. The Endo pills are harder to do than the Mallies. The Mallies are pretty hard to fuck up, but the Endos are easy as hell to fuck up. <br /><br />I recently acquired a few of the 60mg ones that Mom-n-Pop are offering and I&#039;ve had excellent results cooking them, but I&#039;ve been doing it a awhile too. Remember that when you are doing this with any ER pill, you will lose some product one way or another. Either the contin matrix will trap a bit, or you will destroy some with the same heat you use to destroy the contin. The only way to not lose any, or very little, is by breaking out the glassware and your other chemistry gear and using toluene to remove the contin. I have done this with much success, but I generally don&#039;t do it unless I can do 100 at a time. <br /><br />Take your pill and put it in a spoon, then use another spoon to crush it.&nbsp; The Endos crush easy as hell without needing any preheating, the Mallies crush easily after heated. Anyway, crush the pill or pills in a tablespoon. Draw up a full cc in your rig, then fill the plunger cap with water, then have another plunger cap full of water as well. You could also find something to just hold an extra 2cc&#039;s of water as well. Put the spoon on a heating element on your stove. I have gas, gas works better. Using a lighter will take forever. Heat the powder and while heating stir around a bit with a knife or one of those eyeglasses screwdrivers. You just want something that can scratch the melted shit off the bottom of the spoon and make sure all the powder get&#039;s heated as evenly as possible. Once you see the edges of the powder start to brown, remove from heat and keep stirring the powder around. It will start to melt and glob together. Get any stuck to the end of your stirring implement off and in the spoon with the rest of the goodies.<br /><br />You should do this quickly so the morphine does not sit for an extended amount of time in the spoon as the heat will ruin the morphine, but not instantly, so don&#039;t worry too much. Take the rig full of water and squirt the water in, using your stirrer to stir while adding. It should still be hot and sizzle when you squirt in the water. the water/sludge will be black as night and look pretty disgusting, that means it&#039;s right. After that grab one of the plunger caps full of water and dump that in. Stir another 2-3 seconds then toss in your cotton and draw it up. It should be dark brown, like coffee. I like to then dump the other cap in and reheat till it just starts to sizzle then draw that up in another syringe. You can go ahead and eat what&#039;s in the spoon if you want, but it will be pretty beat. It won&#039;t even taste bitter, or it shouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />I have done this so many fucking times I can&#039;t even count. When it comes to doing a few pills, this is the way to do it. It works well and you&#039;ll get a helluva shot. Remember that morphine&#039;s solubility in water is only ~60mg/cc, so you can&#039;t get more than 60mg of morphine in a 1 cc syringe. Since you will only get about 40-50mg from your 60mg pill, I usually do two pills at once. I can get two pretty nice back to back shots that have you itching like hell and grinning from ear to ear.<br /><br />

				I can feel my face, head, chest, and hands prickling just reading this.&nbsp; Good write-up!<br /><br />Oh, and morphine decomposes at around 254 degrees C...&nbsp; Well above the point of boiling water, and can be safely heated for our purposes without worry of decomposition from heat!<br /><br />h**p://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=4681#x27
