				What&#039;s the best drug for you? For me, in order from least to most<br /><br />Tobacco - at the bottom of the list is tobacco - never really did much for me and destroyed my health, wallet and was a fucking bitch to quit. (how people quit shit like heroin when I very easily could have killed myself with cigarettes is beyond me).<br /><br />XTC - then there&#039;s XTC. I had a bad trip on XTC (yes, it happens) and I can&#039;t imagine getting anything useful from it, but it didn&#039;t do all the havoc tobacco did.<br /><br />Marijuana - next is marijuana. marijuana has given me some insights, but for the most part I find them to be false. when i write supposedly genius things down, they never are the next morning. But some legitimate insight which is hard to put into words is possible.<br /><br />PCP - PCP was, for the most part, just not pleasant. but as the only real hallucinogen I&#039;ve done, and as a composer of electronic music, the primarily aural hallucinations of PCP have given me a lot of inspiration for writing music, even if it was just from the one trip where I did very little of the stuff.<br /><br />Booze - Then there&#039;s alcohol. I have a lot of social anxiety so alcohol has allowed me to have some great times with friends and family and I&#039;m grateful for it. Alcohol would probably be at the bottom of many people&#039;s list, but it&#039;s significantly improved the quality of my life.<br /><br />Coffee - simply put, my best thought occur after I&#039;ve had a couple cups of coffee. When I need to really work on a big project and I&#039;m psyched about it, coffee makes me feel more creative and gets my thoughts going better than any drug I&#039;ve tried so far. Not sure whether to put this above or below booze, though, as me having some really cool thoughts and ideas and the impulse to write hasn&#039;t really affected my quality of life yet.<br /><br />In the works is mushrooms which I&#039;ve ordered from here. And my ultimate drug goal is to do Ibogaine. <br /><br />What about you guys? What drug has made your life better?

				Least to most: ...not a comprehensive list, just the most notable. <br /><br />Alcohol:&nbsp; Nothing good has ever come from me taking shots.&nbsp; And it ALWAYS leads to me taking shots.&nbsp; It brings out my competitive side, and that just gets played up by the people I end up drinking with.&nbsp; For some reason drunk me would rather be dead than out-drank.&nbsp; <br /><br />Heroin:&nbsp; It&#039;s fun, I&#039;ll give it that.&nbsp; And for some reason I always end up best friends with whoever I use it with...but that might be all drugs now that I think about it.&nbsp; Not much good for any of my purposes except for turning me into a worthless sleepy-lump.&nbsp; I rather like the itchies though, when they leave me with my skin intact.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only thing that gives me a hangover as well.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Cocaine:&nbsp; Fun.&nbsp; Expensive as shit.&nbsp; But I do enjoy feeling like I&#039;m God, and being able to talk for hours to the nearest person or inanimate object.&nbsp; It just doesn&#039;t last long enough for my liking.<br /><br />Meth:&nbsp; The only downside to this is that it&#039;s fairly socially unacceptable.&nbsp; I like that it makes me alert and focused, but not tweaky.&nbsp; I definitely accomplish more when I&#039;m on it.&nbsp; Plus I find I get a lot less fiend-y than with coke.<br /><br />XTC/MDMA:&nbsp; Good social drug, definitely is a better alternative to drinking for me.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t end up staying up all night and throwing off my sleep pattern so bad I&#039;d probably use a lot more of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Weed:&nbsp; Best drug for me, and honestly probably the main contributing factor as to why I&#039;m alive.&nbsp; No joke.&nbsp; If it weren&#039;t for the munchies I would honestly be too lazy to go find food.&nbsp; Plus, most people smoke, so its something I can do casually with a large group instead of going off by myself.&nbsp; ;)

				Psilocybin and MDMA have both been an absolute force for good in my life. Psilocybin forced me to confront the worst aspects of myself and deal with them, MDMA helped me rebuild myself and become a more open and extrovert person. I&#039;m calmer, happier and less egotistical these days, relationships are easier, I&#039;m much more open minded but have a lower tolerance to bullshit. <br /><br />It&#039;s also notable that since using both of these drugs, I haven&#039;t drunk to excess, had a hangover or made a cunt of myself under the influence of alcohol.<br /><br />The other drugs I take are functional (modafinil, xxracetams) or brain candy (2C-B, MDA etc).

				I totally agree on cigarettes being the worst, but I&#039;d like to take note that I said cigarettes not tobacco, there is a difference. I quit about a year ago and it was harder than anything I&#039;ve ever tried to do.<br /><br />Next, alcohol is horrible and horrible for you, not to mention its acceptable in normal day society so you can drive your car and kill a family of 5 and not remember a thing. <br /><br />To each his own but I&#039;m NEVER fucking with heroin. Too many dead or locked up people I know. Fuck that.<br /><br />HALLUCINOGENS CHANGED MY LIFE TAKE THEM! TAKE MOLLY TOO! <br /><br />LSD HAS TO BE GOOD FOR YOU!

				Alcohol and Meth can suck my dick.<br /><br />MDMA was a powerfully helpful entheogen in getting out of the corner the rare once or twice a year I could come up with the balls to go out and to a party (I have no friends, social, etc. ... bad :( ).<br />Methylone is fun.<br /><br />Weed I use for pain, and meh it&#039;s just weed :)<br /><br />LSD is a project in the works (with the tool in hand)<br /><br />Havnt done H but have nothing against it as I know my own willpower towards addiction, and besides the only source I could get it from is SR, so it&#039;d be easy to self-regulate.<br /><br />Other opiate, oxycodone would be my fav. mostly cuz I havnt tried the range of opiates, far far FAR too expensive for me to ever even consider buying opiates.<br /><br />Benzo&#039;s have been a godsend in keeping me from ... G O I N G&nbsp; B A L L I S T I C on someone.&nbsp; Clonazepam is my fav., alprazolam (xan) are good but meh nothing special, just have street name/cred.&nbsp; <br />This unscheduled Etizolam is pretty damned good too, esp. for u know being legal and only costing $0.42ea (not on here, just every single clearnet Rx site that exists :D).<br /><br />On the legal note, Kratom is awesome, I don&#039;t care what anyone says (you naysayers bought shit kratom off an iamshaman site and are sour you fail at researching ahead :) ).&nbsp; Mild opiate + stimulant + legal = productive workday.<br /><br />I plan on taking 5-MeO-DMT (for it&#039;s first time) in my last hours of life (for spiritual reasons)

				I think mdma and ghb have been the most helpful drugs for me. <br /><br />Ghb is a great for anxiety and depression, also good for just relaxing and taking a load off. The sex also isn&#039;t bad and can be pretty darn good at the right dose. <br /><br />Mdma is the ultimate therapy tool. Your defenses go down and you can confront the most ugliest of realities without fear. You feel loved and worthy of being loved. When done right, the experience itself can be a tool for confronting things while not on the drug.

Yes, mushrooms/pscilocybin can have the effect of massively opening the mind to a whole range of metaphysical phenomena but DMT does something very different. For me, a strong hit of DMT is like being shot out of a cannon down a corridor in the library of forbidden knowledge at 1000mph, where one witnesses all kinds of stunning revelations that we don&#039;t have the capacity to interpret and are probably not meant to know about. Also whilst just sitting every other evening giving yourself micro-doses and maybe the odd mild dose can be a pleasant and not too overwhelming way to use DMT, I have found that any kind of regular usage of DMT has the effect of eroding the foundation stones of someones outlook and certainty about life. This is of course can be ultimately a positive process although not necessarily a comfortable one. <br /><br />The only time have hit a totally euphoric state after a strong dose of DMT, is when I have vaped some after arriving home from being out clubbing on MDMA. Any time I have been straight and taken a strong dose, the experience is simply fucking mental. Amazing? Thrilling? Most certainly! But more in the same way as a bungee jump would be other than as a profound spiritual experience.......that is just my personal experience of course........but I would say that DMT is far too intense and far too short to be used as an ideal spiritual/mental development tool.<br /><br />As for the &#039;best drugs&#039; for a person:<br /><br />The &#039;social&#039; drugs such as alcohol, MDMA, cocaine, etc are all poisons which most of us find pleasurable to indulge in from time to time. Anyone who attaches any sense of real &#039;developmental&#039; benefit to these things is on a very wrong path as far as I am concerned. <br /><br />Weed/cannabis, can be used both as a social/pleasure substance and also as a psychoactive substance which can shift mental perception allowing for insights that the user would otherwise not have. However, this drug seems to focus the mind very much on the realm of the bodily senses (and the gratification thereof), which is its big limitation. Whilst providing it is used without tobacco products, THC is much healthier than any of the other &#039;social&#039; drugs, these &#039;restricted&#039; psycho-activity properties can have a crippling effect on an individuals mental/spiritual development, whilst fooling the individual into thinking that it is the opposite that is the case. <br /><br />So obviously, the substances which can be most beneficial are the hallucinogenics which I can vouch have made my life 10 times more interesting and have assisted my spiritual/mental development massively, opening my mind to realities about the world that I would have otherwise remained completely ignorant to. I have used LSD, mushrooms, and in recent time, DMT. My favourite of all is probably the mushrooms as although they take the user on a mad rollercoaster ride similar to what LSD does, everything about mushrooms is so much more down to Earth whereas the paradigms/delusions generated by LSD tend to be less bound with natural energies, and much more persistent. Thus the LSD user has to spend more of his post trip time, living under his LSD trip generated illusions/delusions.<br /><br />Now that I have discovered Silk Road, Mescaline could very much be on the menu but aside from all the other uncertainties......it does seem very pricey.

This has given me some awful insomnia and made me feel like complete shit...<br />Heroin-You feel pretty good for a while but when it&#039;s done all I do is wish I never would have touched it.<br />Alcohol-The thing that I really like about it is that you can do it in public without going to jail (usually lol).&nbsp; I also just plain enjoy being blackout buzzed.<br />Cocaine-I love this because you feel like you&#039;re the most amazing person on earth.&nbsp; Only reason this isn&#039;t higher is that sometimes the burst of energy gets to me...<br />Weed-Probably my most used and I guess I could call it my favorite in some aspects.&nbsp; It&#039;s never let me down and eating Taco Bell or McDonalds stoned is SO fun.<br />LSD-I always love the new aspect on reality you get after the trips but it&#039;s also kind of fun seeing every color smear and change.<br />Ecstasy-The absolute best feeling the world.&nbsp; Simply intoxicating in every essence.

				Most drugs are not good for me, or anyone else I believe.<br /><br />Uppers and downers are not much good in my opinion, except for some judiciously applied uppers for work related use where one knows what one is doing and downers in moderation for their anti stress affects I don&#039;t think there is much positive about them.<br /><br />If you&#039;re just asking what do I like? What&#039;s fun? Weed, Alcohol and Cocaine are my preferred abuse.<br /><br />Weed can be beneficial in the right set and setting, but it can also be pretty destructive, apathy and all probably isn&#039;t all the herbs fault but there is some link.<br /><br />Psychedelics are the only things that have truly had a positive impact in my life, a shame since I haven&#039;t used them as much as I have abused of lesser substances.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mushrooms are great, I&#039;ve got some real respect for them since they have help me realize a lot about myself and improve myself as a person.&nbsp; They&#039;re also the only psychedelic that I&#039;ve had the privilege of using more than a few times and being able to learn extensively from them.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried LSD and San Pedro and I see lots of potential in them but I would need to try them again to learn more about them and begin to use them therapeutically/as a student of their insights.

				I think it changes depending on my mood...<br /><br />I like Amphetamines if I need to get shit done, and benzos/z-drugs/queitiapine if I want to chill out/sleep.<br /><br />But mainly I&#039;m just a pot head - I love weed! If I had to pick only one drug for the rest of my life it&#039;d be weed. <br /><br />Like someone said above it gives me great creative energy and allows me to think about things/myself/life/whatever in a different and usually helpful way. My only downside of it is it took me a while to get the munchies under control and I started putting weight on - but I&#039;ve got that sorted now (turns out anything will taste good when you have the munchies, it doesn&#039;t *always* have to be a Harold and Kumar/White Castle munch out where you go for the most amazing food and then eat a ton of it :) ...but sometimes it&#039;s nice!)<br /><br />I&#039;m going to be trying LSD soon so maybe my thoughts will change.

				1. MDMA and a pack of Lucky Strikes are definitely a requirement for my &quot;The World&#039;s going to be invaded by zombies one day and so I&#039;m adding these drugs to my ration supply&quot;. MDMA&#039;s and the general shelf life of Phenethlylphines give them huge bonuses. Although MDMA doesn&#039;t have the profound visuals Cid would have, (granted you get any real visuals from MDMA) still being able to move, focus, drive while feeling completely like love makes MDMA my #1 yet still having CEV&#039;s and a brighter more vibrant world.<br /><br />2. LSD lacks Molly&#039;s shelf life but still it is my favorite psychedelic, feeling the earth tremble and quake as the world spread and rose into a fractal was so beautiful! However, LSD is something you&#039;ve got to take good care of you can loose it, damage it or if you&#039;re lucky contaminate yourself with it by accident but LSD + MDMA makes it worth the risks, Amen!<br /><br />3. Marijuana used to be all I need, it goes with virtually any drug, helps me sleep or relax, easy to get&nbsp; and there&#039;s so much you can do with it! Make a Green Dragon Tincture, roll join, use a pipe vaporize, make cannabutter which can then be put in a sauté! The high is now just okay in comparison of all the other drugs I&#039;ve tried not but there is always a place in my system for THC. Lol, stoner.<br /><br />4. Psilocybin - Cubes kind of killed shrooms a bit for me since the first like ounce worth of mushrooms that were going around when I started buying them were all cyanescenes and I&#039;d make tea with an eight and have the first trip of my life where everything around me was just another character but when I started by cubes for nearly the same price I&#039;d have a bad trip thinking I got jipped until I realized the strain difference. I prefer LSD now because it&#039;s easier to take and I&#039;ve kind of got a weak stomach, not saying I don&#039;t try to push it.<br /><br />5. DXM - Ah, when you&#039;re a kid but can read a label to check for Acetaminophen, there&#039;s always Dex! When Dexter met an Orphan I remember I closed my eyes and saw Frank Sinatra&#039;s dismembered head sing to me! I also remember being so confused in my ability to walk , but hey there&#039;s a reason why they call it Disassociation. Still DXM + Weed is definitely worth a try even if you do not want or are trying to cut off DXM.<br /><br />Honorable Mentions:<br /><br />DOB, someone sold me DOB claiming it was LSD, it&#039;s still an interesting good drug but definitely not worth 10$ a tab, kept me up all night for sure.<br /><br />Whiskey is my kind of lullaby<br /><br />Bennadryl - OH, the madness, DXM is a way better OTC. Bennadryl makes you stare at small dogs in FEAR...<br /><br />San Pedro - Definently more of a spiritual experience than a high, it took me hours to remove the spines, carefully peel the skin without removing the mucus layer and then de-core, to top it off was the cooking process which took all day. I lit so much incense and listened to music yet only seemed to feel a light molly glow. Still the experience was totally worth it though the chugging not so much. Planted a piece too!<br /><br />I pretty much haven&#039;t tried anything else, except what might have been in a pill...<br /><br />P.S. Sorry about spelling errors<br />
