				Yeah, I don&#039;t like today&#039;s cartoons.<br /><br />Where I live there&#039;s a channel that plays only cartoons from the 80s and 90s. I love to watch it whenever I&#039;m tripping.&nbsp; He-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Garfield, Bobby&#039;s World, Inspector Gadget...... These shows are hilarious when tripping.

				Oh man Tex Avery...&nbsp; this was my psychedelic before I knew of psychedelics.<br /><br />Batman: The Animated Series was a total mind bender to me as well.&nbsp; Ol&#039; bruce got gassed in more than a few episodes, and then the madness set in.&nbsp; <br /><br />I miss Ed, Edd, &amp; Eddy as well, but I guess that was later on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wish I could catch up with some current stuff.&nbsp; Adventure Time had me laughing out loud, and Regular Show was pretty good too.&nbsp; The new Avengers series is very well done.

				I&#039;m actually really curious about media that may be created to catch the &quot;eye&quot; of someone on psychs. I&#039;ve definitely seen some stuff that makes me wonder.<br /><br />Oh god, Ren and Stimpy while tripping? Eesh.<br /><br />Archer is some good shit.<br /><br />Adventure Time is worth a go on psychs for sure.
