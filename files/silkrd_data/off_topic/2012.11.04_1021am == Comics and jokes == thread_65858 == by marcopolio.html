				I feel that so much of this forum is so serious (as it should be for a site selling illegal substances) but also that its full of people who like to have fun (using substances bought here) that it would be good to bring some humor into the mix. Personally I enjoy comedians/standup comedy a lot and i&#039;m curious as to who other people are into, and a thread about jokes or favorite comedians would be one more thing to enjoy here. To start off two of my favorite comedians are Mitch Hedberg and Stephen Wright both of which have a similar deadpan style. I would also highly recommend Stewart Lee a British comedian, i&#039;ve only met a couple people in the US that know of him but his Identity bit is one of my favorites. Other shout outs to Dave Chappelle, Louis CK, Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor, and Jerry Seinfeld.<br /><br />*I used to do drugs. I still do drugs. But I used to, too. <br />*An escalator can never break: it can only become stairs. You should never see an Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order sign, just Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience. <br />*I don&#039;t have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who&#039;d be mad at me for saying that. <br />*On a traffic light green means &#039;go&#039; and yellow means &#039;yield&#039;, but on a banana it&#039;s just the opposite. Green means &#039;hold on,&#039; yellow means &#039;go ahead,&#039; and red means, &#039;where the hell did you get that banana at?&#039;<br />*My friend said to me, &quot;I think the weather&#039;s trippy.&quot; I said, &quot;No, man, it&#039;s not the weather that&#039;s trippy, perhaps it is the way that we perceive it that is indeed trippy.&quot; Then I thought, &quot;Man, I should have just said, &#039;Yeah.&#039;&quot;<br />-Mitch Hedberg <br /><br />*You know how it feels when you&#039;re leaning back on a chair, and you lean too far back, and you almost fall over backwards, but then you catch yourself at the last second? I feel like that all the time.<br />*I went to the hardware store and bought some used paint. It was in the shape<br />of a house. I bought some batteries, but they weren&#039;t included. <br />*The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.<br />*I think it&#039;s wrong that only one company makes the game Monopoly. <br />*Join the Army, meet interesting people, kill them.<br />*Eagles may soar, but weasels don&#039;t get sucked into jet engines.<br />*I have two very rare photographs.<br />One is a picture of Houdini locking his keys in his car.<br />The other is a rare photograph of Norman Rockwell beating up a child.<br />-Steven Wright

				Nice thread idea marcopolio I&#039;ll add a quote from one of my favourites Bill Hicks, something I hope most of us can relate to here, especially after the word honestly...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Bill Hicks</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&#039;No, I don&#039;t do drugs anymore, either. But I&#039;ll tell you something about drugs. I used to do drugs, but I&#039;ll tell you something honestly about drugs, honestly, and I know it&#039;s not a very popular idea, you don&#039;t hear it very often anymore, but it is the truth: I had a great time doing drugs. Sorry. Never murdered anyone, never robbed anyone, never raped anyone, never beat anyone, never lost a job, a car, a house, a wife or kids, laughed my ass off, and went about my day.&#039;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Great words from a great comedian :)
