				This is my UPDATED post :D<br /><br />Here&#039;s a tiiiiiiiiiiny folio for you to love:<br />http://xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/qicpic/files/wx1.jpg<br /><br />Check &#039;em out. I usually charge between 1-5 BTC per project, but if you feel the need to haggle, go for it; I won&#039;t be offended ;)<br /><br />DB<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Imaginarytailus13: Its been almost a week since Drobro11 and I have been working together. In the beginning I asked Drobo11 if he could design a logo based on a idea I had, he replied that he would come up with something shortly. After the first draft I asked him to rework it and make it more lively, he did so by sending me a 2nd draft. At this point I was quite happy with the logo and proceeded to discuss about the payment/commissions. We reached an agreement almost instantly and I asked him to make a few final changes to the logo, which he did. I was very happy with Drobro11`s work since on the 2nd draft so I felt comfortable to pay him in advance for the final. The final was sent to me the next day. Things moved quickly and we discussed the possibility of new ideas. Some of the ideas he put out were great and after the 1st commission, he sent rough drafts of the ideas he came up with. Upon reviewing them I commissioned a new logo based on an idea he had and was sent numerous drafts to choose from the following days. I ended up picking most of the designs, and am currently waiting on my btc deposit to pay him for 3 variants of one logo, 2 variants of another. Dobro11 has always answered my mails quickly and is a pleasure to talk to and work with. I highly recommend Drobro11 for his artwork/logo services.<br /><br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 20DollarBILL: DroBro11 and I conducted some business the other night and got to talking a bit. He mentioned to me that he was a Graphic Designer&nbsp; and if I ever needed anything to hit him up and we could work something out. It was funny that he told me this because that day I was looking into have templates made for my listings. I just wanted to make them stand out and look more professional . I immediately responded to him and told him vaguely what I was looking for. He was able to take the little bit of direction I gave him and make a few different samples for me with in minutes. Like I said withing minutes, I had four different samples to go over. The quality was awesome and it was exactly what I had pictured in my head. I then told him which of the samples that I like. He told me he would work on touching it up and get back to me with a final copy. Maybe an hour went by and I had my final copy. He also included three other versions that he worked on. I was very happy with all of them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So to recap. This guy is easy to talk with. He can interpret your ideas and and make them into a high quality products. He also works very quickly and keeps you updated throughout the process.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend him.<br /><br /><br />Quote<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Chronic Crew: DroBro11................ HOOKED MY SHIT UP!!!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; excellent work, great pricing and just what I wanted!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; TRUST ME, if you need graphic designs, you can&#039;t go wrong DROBRO11<br />

				ahh. great idea. I&#039;ve actually been needing this service for a tattoo idea of mine. but not for five fucking bitcoins though. shits crazy. one would be too much. Additionally, for some constructive criticism with respect, you should update your portfolio so people can see more of what you do.
