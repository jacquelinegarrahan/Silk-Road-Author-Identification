				So everytime I put anything on CraigsList, I get bombarded with those fucking 419 scammers offering to send me a check and then wire them the money before it clears (so that I go into debt). <br /><br />Never fell for the scam but I do mess with the scammers for fun. Mainly, I get them to mail checks to the police or the FBI, then jerk them around, tell them to drive long distances saying I accidentally wired money to the wrong state, shit like that. I&#039;ve tried to get them to send ME money on occasion but it never works.<br /><br />I&#039;d really like to pop one of these scammers though. So does anybody know how to trace an IP address?<br /><br /><br />

				If you trace it - and it probably leads to a cyber cafe in Nigeria - you&#039;re going to get on a plane and get yourself popped.<br /><br />The 419 scammers are an industry, they use US mules who are trying to earn small dollars by helping pass money back. If you did find someone in the USA they&#039;re a small cog you would feel sorry for if you heard their story.<br />

				Its simply to trace a IP, But most people who have a little sense mask it and use a VPN, which makes it almost impossiable to trace themm

				419eater is so funny. There is one bait on there where a guy got some Nigerians to strap a toilet to a bike in order to be part of his &quot;church&quot; and take pictures. He sent them certificates which they attatched to the toilet bikes ahahhaha, I&#039;ll try and find the link now it is so fuckin funny.
