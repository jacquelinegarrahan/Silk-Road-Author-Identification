				Although i never meet him he gave me the creeps, for those who don&#039;t know him,( most of the world outside the UK ) hes was one of our more flamboyant celebrities, he had a show called jim will fix it where he would take kids dreams and make them true, sort of. He had a thing about gold chains, think Mr T but in a shell suit&nbsp; and white. Anyway a year after his death it turns out there&#039;s a very real possibility he was a pedophile, cases of abuse have been investigated by a channel 4 program, quite a lot of evidence stacking up against him, who&#039;d have thought it, a kids entertainer a nonce.

				Fucking right. Imagine being a young preteen girl in the audience of Top of the Pops and being invited backstage to meet Jimmy Saville, Gary Glitter and Pete Townsend.<br /><br />You&#039;re going home with a sore arse that night...oh yes.<br /><br />Fancy that! A glam rock spit roast with Saville and Glitter before Townsend comes along and sticks his knob in your mouth to make you airtight 70s style.<br />
