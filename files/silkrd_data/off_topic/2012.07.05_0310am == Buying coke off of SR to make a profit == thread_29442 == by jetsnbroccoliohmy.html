				So it seems the coke off of SR is ridicilously expensive.&nbsp; I can get it from my local dealer for $50 a gram and it is fairly decent stuff.&nbsp; Does anyone here actually buy it to sell it?&nbsp; I want to know how you guys make money off of it , the only profitable thing I was able to make money off of is MDMA.<br /><br />I know there is the cutting route, but I feel that only hurts your business no on wants cut coke although lots of people claim 83% flake coke on here.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t went ahead and bought a gram of coke off here yet I just can&#039;t justify spending $100+&nbsp; a gram.&nbsp; I know for a fact no one will buy a gram of coke for 100+ in my town they would look at me like I am retarded.&nbsp;

				Find clients who desire and respect pure cocaine. I know there are plenty out there who would never touch the disgusting crap those people who look at you &quot;retarded&quot; are happily snorting. Smaller client base but more respectable and safer in my opinion. I do see your point of a smaller profit margin especially when you calculate risk.

				So far the coke biz on SR is more or less retail only.&nbsp; I think eventually you&#039;ll see some wholesale stuff coming more directly from the source, but I could be wrong.&nbsp; The problem, as I see it, is that most of the coke on SR comes from either Europe, the U.S. or Canada.&nbsp; A huge part of the retail price of cocaine is in the smuggling from the source, South America, to the user country.&nbsp; Once the coke gets to the U.S. or Europe, all the cost of smuggling it is baked in.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s only a matter of time, however, until we see coke on SR from South America, but then again, maybe not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really don&#039;t understand why we haven&#039;t seen it yet.<br /><br />I read somewhere that good coke in Colombia costs $2000 - $4000 per kilo.&nbsp; If that&#039;s true (and I don&#039;t know for sure that it is), then someone could make a killing on here selling grams straight from Colombia for $50.&nbsp; Why not?

				Is your 50$ gram weighting .8 ? Last time i bought coke locally here in Canada was 5 years ago and this was pure bomb, 170$ for a 3.5 and it was like unbreakable rocks. The kind of coke that you have to cut.. I have not that contact anymore :(

				I think everything on SR is massively expensive compared to buying the conventional way. The only gain is that occasionally you can get some unusual things. However even then it&#039;s still not worth it. I can get 7 grams of top grade weed where I live for £30, which is already expensive in my view. The last time I looked it was £4.18 for 1 bitcoin&nbsp; and the cheapest deal on 7g of good quality domestic weed&nbsp; was 16..20 Bc which = nearly&nbsp; £65. Why exactly would anyone bother at these kinds of prices?

				Plenty of people who live professional lives outside of the drug scene. Like me, have no way to get almost anything. Only thing I can get is Cannabis easily because this is a Medical state and there are stores that sell it here.<br /><br />Yes there are people like me who have no idea how to get it locally except going to the streets and finding dealers I don&#039;t know, I may as well go pick up a streetwalker with that level of risk.<br /><br />**Disclaimer** Streetwalkers are disgusting and I would never do that. Same goes for the quality I&#039;d be able to find on the streets if I had to.

				Mmm ... I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s OK if you have money to burn I guess. But there&#039;s no way SR prices are competitive. I guess if you don&#039;t want to mix with scummy street dealers directly, it might work out for you. But BitCoin inflation rates are way above normal inflation rates too. 2 or so weeks ago 1 Bc was going for around £3.16, 2 weeks later it was £4.18. That&#039;s some crazy inflation going on right there.

				Well the value of my physical money is certainly deflating. However the cost of Bitcoins (which can&#039;t really be considered real currency) is increasing at an exponentially alarming rate. £4.60 for 1 a few minutes ago. So take your pick.

				Selling coke at the low level is the easiest way to get yourself in trouble.<br /><br />If you use coke then selling usually becomes more coke.<br /><br />I think coke is a drug best used a few times a year.<br /><br />As for coke here being not a good standard, I would beg to differ.<br /><br />I agree some parts of the USA and some immigrant communities have very good coke that would sell on here like hotcakes.<br /><br />But selling coke, its dangerous. <br /><br />Selling kilos, people would kill you for a kilo or two. <br /><br />So my advice is stay away from selling in RL.<br /><br />I like a bit of coke but if I had to choose between coke and weed, coke loses always.

				You could easily do it depending on where you live. I am suggesting you would be blatantly ripping people off though (if you claimed it was what the SR vendors list it as to your customers). However, if you have repeat customers happy with your service, who am I to judge? If your customers were experienced and shifty and you gave them SR coke and said it was 60+% pure cocaine you might find yourself in pieces in a block of concrete somewhere .<br /><br />Stick with weed/lsd/mdma. the sourcing of good and consistent cocaine on SR is not a good business model for longevity.

				Late 90&#039;s I bought mdma pills for 2.5€ per 100 on a weekly base, after a few months this became 1.5€/100.<br />Street price : 5€&nbsp; Now that was easy money. The quality was mostly good, i always tested a new batch upfront in normal no clubbing circumstances. If good i buy if not satisfied I skipped. <br />It wasnt always pure mdma but if they were good i bought. So yes I also sold adultrated product back then but hey aldultrated or not it was always bomb :) I only got 1 guy complaining it wasnt good while he was gurning like hell with his eyes closed and barely able to stand up. Ok he probably expected clean mdma while it wasnt but everyone one else was just giving : thumbs up :)<br />I got cought only once for getting sloppy. The clubowner just flushed the pills and thrown me out. No le involved.<br />The dealer I got em from was talking to security when the club closed, they were both biker fans. He pulled a photo of his bike to show and accidently a bag with coke fell out of his wallet. <br />He was less lucky, he was turned over to le wich searched his house and he went to jail.<br /><br />A lot has changed, mdma is not as common as it used to be nowadays around clubs here. Seems like coke totaly replaced it.<br />Also I&#039;m out of the scene. As of today I prefer clean mdma as I can&#039;t afford to get knocked of my feet anymore. And I use only few times a year on good occasions.<br />The mdma pills on sr are also above the street price, I look for good stuff &lt;=5€ (only bulk can meet this price). I use a xls sheet to check prices and noted an increase of 15-30% in pill prices(specialy for small orders) since I joined wich is a lot.<br /><br />As for the &quot;dangers&quot; involved with buying/selling on the street :<br /><br />Try to sell to trusted users.<br />Never sell to desperate people, specialy if they come alone. (see below)<br />If you see an unfamiliar face in the club drinking water watching everyone and asking around for stuff just go somewhere else and stay out of there for a week or two. It often preceeds a razzia or a le ambush just around the corner.<br /><br />If you buy then don&#039;t go into the dark ally, just by in or around clubs you should know who to talk to. For me this gets harder as i&#039;m getting older and thus look more suspicious&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />If you want to buy for resale then only patience is what you need. The guys I bought these cheap pills from I was introduced to by some chicks who were totaly wasted and spotted me being wasted in a corner aswel. Everything went smooth from there on untill he got busted (see above). Another dealers i got introduced to was through a friend. He knew some people in holland we agreed to drive there together. It was not a place to feel comftable alone, they werent dutch, they had guns in theyre pants. That place was just like in the movies with sportsbags full of dope. The first time i went there they even drugged me beyond my knowledge.. it was in my drink. Still if you show respect and dont act like a scared weasel shitting his pants when one of these guys steps forward in an intimidating way your set for nice deals. <br /><br />Some guys also prefer to drive you around. You meet at a parking lot, step in the car drive around a bit while buying your stuff.<br /><br />All of this looks risky it maybe is. I did not realy think of bad things happening, and they never did. (except for being drugged beyond my knowledge that one time.) Finding the right guys is the hardest part if your looking for &quot;resale&quot; deals and even then you need patience while they test your thustwortyness.
