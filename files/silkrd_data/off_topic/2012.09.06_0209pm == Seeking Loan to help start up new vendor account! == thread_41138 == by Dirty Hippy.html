				Im looking for a loan of about 300 dollars in BTC&nbsp; to start up a new Vendors account. I will be offering Medical Quality Cannabis, Medical Quality Hashish, Meth and possible Black tar heroin.<br />If anyone can help me out i am willing to give you back an extra 50 on top of the 300 within 7 days. Or you can choose 350 dollars worth from my wares when i get them up. I anyone can help i would owe you so much.<br />Now a little about me. I have been a buyer on SR for about 7months now and was vending for about 3. after an IRL situation i had to shut down the old account and im looking to start back up!<br /><br />Let me know<br /><br />D.H.

				Just like a hippy to want something for free. If you can&#039;t afford a vendor account, you have no business being a vendor! being a vendor is running a business, and businesses require start up capital. I guess you could apply for a loan from the SBA (if in the US) but they would probably require matching funds.

				I consider it very unprofessional to come asking for money to become a vendor. It pretty well says everything I need to know about you as a vendor. Tells people you don&#039;t have enough cash to fund your dealings. Sorry but its true.
