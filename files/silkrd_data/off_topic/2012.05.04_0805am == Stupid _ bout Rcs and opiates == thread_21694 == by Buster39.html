				Why cant the make an RC opiate like they do with weed? Would Oxycontin or something like that almost be an rc of opium/heroin? I probably sound stupid but its late and I was just day dreaming.

				Opioid compounds are somewhat of a mystery to chemists. Since these compounds are illegal they cannot benefit from the knowledge that an entire community of chemists could add to the discussion. Alexander Shulgin was the last of his kind, in that he was able, and willing, to research the action of new drugs he synthesized by dosing them himself. The fact that he had a DEA license to do this, is what made him the last imo. You should look at some of his work and how he went about studying different compounds. His books PiHKAL and TiHKAL are great books, even for the non-chemist. Basically he would start with a particular compound, bioassay it(he would take it to see if it was active)record the experience, then he would move just one group one position and dose it again. It&#039;s time consuming to do it that way, but you cant do it any other way because we don&#039;t really know how the receptors in our brains work and how they will respond to certain changes. The work Shulgin did went a long way towards documenting how those changes effected the activity of certain compounds and helped us to understand how the brain&#039;s receptors operate. He really took an enormous chance every time he dosed one of those new compounds. <br /><br />Opioid compounds are like a loaded gun. Small changes in the position of groups or the addition of groups may increase a compound&#039;s potency thousands of times, making an overdose possible by just getting it on your skin. I assume this is why the RC industry stays clear of these, in addition to the analog act making most of them illegal anyway.<br /><br />Just a guess, but I can&#039;t think of a better reason, especially considering how coveted these compounds are. There are some compounds out there, but you won&#039;t find them sold as RCs.

				they actually made tons of research chems in the opioid class...<br /><br />most of the research is all based on medicine and making useful research tools. Very quickly many effective opioids were synthd by pharmaceutical companies and the useful ones were patented. there are literally thousands... <br /><br />the problem is most of the design is based on receptor specificity or activity:<br />- when you design a super specific, high activity 5ht2a agonist you produce a great compound for receptor profiling and localization, but with limited patent potential due to the lack of medical usage... and it just so happens to an amazing psychedelic. this is the case with the nbome series essentially<br /><br />- when you produce a specific high affinity mu agonist the problem is you kill people. potent opioid research chems are simply too dangerous for mass market and were all very quickly outlawed or controlled... the ones that were useful are mainly now used in medicine. check out some of the crazy opioid medications used in places like china... many are semi-synthetic derivatives synthd last century. many of these research molecules ended up having potency thousands of times stronger than morphine and simply is not possible to safely dose or even handle<br /><br />there have been actually a few rc available targeting mu receptors, generally with potency a few times greater than morphine... even one recently but i forget what it was called. not many places carry em cause they risk liability from overdose and attracting too much attention.
