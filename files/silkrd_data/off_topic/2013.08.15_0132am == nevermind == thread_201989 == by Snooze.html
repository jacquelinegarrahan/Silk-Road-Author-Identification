				Hey man, thats some terrible news and my heart goes out to you! <br /><br />It sounds as if its been caught before advancing to far and so to help aid your fight against this I suggest you look into dieting. As a lot goes on in your colon keeping it has healthy as possible will only see you get better sooner :)<br /><br />Here&#039;s a couple of basic links and without a doubt if you were to sit down and look into it heavily you&#039;d find much more helpful information than whats written below.<br /><br />http://www.hopkinscoloncancercenter.org/CMS/CMS_Page.aspx?CurrentUDV=59&amp;CMS_Page_ID=8345F49E-9814-467C-B7F3-A68FC4c6FE96<br />http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/can-foods-affect-colon-cancer-survival/?_r=0<br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nalini-chilkov/anti-cancer-diet_b_1319152.html

				My condolences go out to you and your family.<br />I wish you the very best in your treatment and wish you a full speed recovery.<br />I can&#039;t even imagine what it&#039;s like to be diagnosed with cancer. <br />But on the bright side, you have a wonderful, supportive community that&#039;s here to help in any way possible.<br /><br />I personally don&#039;t know of any good meds that might help other than the ganja.<br />Can&#039;t go wrong there tho!<br /><br />Keep us posted.

				Ah man, this is terrible! I have this strong feeling that you will fight through it with no problems!<br />Smoke the highest quality dank, maybe a few pain pills from time to time (don&#039;t over do it, just as needed) and one big thing I know from experience (immediate family) is when you start kemo, stay hydrated! I&#039;m saying carry a gallon of filtered water with you anywhere you go, start a daily vitamin regimen, and again stay hydrated! Kemo will drain you of electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals. as well as lower dopamine levels. (the ganja will help there though)<br /><br />Keep us posted, you have our support!

				High CBD Marijuana and the importance of family/friends will push you to beat this.<br />Remember to eat a healthy diet, and take your anti-oxidants like clockwork.<br />There are lots of things you can do on your part to make it through this.<br /><br />Also, make sure you find a very good surgeon/support staff.&nbsp; MD Anderson is amazing if you have one near you.<br />My mother had cancer, and her surgeon and team of doctors saved her life and she made a glowing recovery.<br /><br />Cancer is a bitch, but in many cases curable.&nbsp; <br />Hopefully you caught it in time and have a full and healthy recovery.<br />Feel more than welcome to PM me if you need to.<br />Best wishes!<br /><br />Vanquish

				Really sorry to hear that :/ I&#039;ve heard drinking alkaline water everyday prevents and can even cure cancer. Read something about it on DPR&#039;s page or something. Other than that I would just say try to get medical marijuana strains with high CBD %. Also Ive been hearing lately that they&#039;ve researched cannabis and concluded that it kills off cancer cells and promotes new growth of healthy cells. I can&#039;t speak from experience for any of this but I hope this info benefits you in any way possible. I really wish you all the best. :)

				Hang in there buddy. I went through chemo and radiation a few years back. get yourself mentally prepared. Chemo is goin g to kick your ass. I think using concentrates will be helpful. try to stock up because you will be too weak to shop once you start it.<br />I have .52 btc in one of my SR accounts. i just found you on SR. I just sent it to you to help you get as much medicine as you can. Just don&#039;t expose my account name here. And if you need help don&#039;t be afraid to ask. <br />Any questions or need advice send me a message. You&#039;ll beat it man. but prepare yourself as much as you can.

				i feel ya but the op came here and didn&#039;t ask for nothing. its in the off topic section and i assume he was letting it off his chest. it consumes your mind and i see nothing odd about him posting about it.<br />I hope the op doesn&#039;t regret posting here for support because he is suspected of scamming because i gave him .52 btc.

				Instead of calling a man out on a supposed scam, how about you just don&#039;t give him coin, and wish him the best. That way you can be sympathetic and not be A FUCKING ASSHOLE.<br /><br />Wishing you well, my friend. Fuck the rest of &#039;em.

I think that upon receiving that kind of news that anyone would need to vent. The written word can have a tremendous power to heal in that if you write thoughts down they don&#039;t go round and round your head and it helps think difficult situations through. Also, I honestly think that the SR community at large would have some good advice for you so you can help prepare, much more so than lots of other places online who might be wary to suggest different weed strains etc.<br /><br />One thing I do know is that staying positive and positive thinking helps with cancer. The human mind can be a powerful tool in itself. <br /><br />And, there&#039;s no bee&#039;s nest of suspicion here - just lots of positive vibes and well wishes coming your way xxxx &lt;3.
