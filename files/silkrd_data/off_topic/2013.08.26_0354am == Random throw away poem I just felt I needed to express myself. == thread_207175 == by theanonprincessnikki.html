Am I alone or do you also feel this way? marking the<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; X&#039;s on my calender till my last day. Oh California-ay I can&#039;t wait till I see your face,move away from the M-I-A,maybe to a more lovely place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sick of these people,yet I feel so much like them,I guess I&#039;m just a rebel who must keep on fighting.&nbsp; So young yet I feel so mature, if money can&#039;t make me happy then I guess life&#039;s a bore. Love here, sex there,what a big nightmare,worst part is I can&#039;t tell if my own family cares. Why do I sop, why do I moan,sometimes I think it&#039;s best to just leave it alone. Killing myself? I don&#039;t think so, see there is a reason I&#039;m alive I just don&#039;t know. Not sure if god exist,not sure I give a shit,Hell or heaven either way I have a cup full of sins. Drowning in the gin,we meet once again my friend the poison to my liver,cocaine for dinner,a basket full of pills doesn&#039;t cage my thrill. Am I finally growing up? I&#039;m sure if I re read this poem I will surly throw up. See you and me ,we are quiet a like we don&#039;t like reading dramatic poems late up at night. See you and me, we are quiet alike we both have a taste for drugs and this life.<br /><br /><br />Just had a very stressful day huns, and thought it would only be healthy for me mentally to share this, seeing as tomorrow is also my first day of college I&#039;m beyond stressed.&nbsp; I hope everyone else is having a great day/night
