				Just as they said they would, public information officers with the Seattle Police Department handed out 1,000 bags of Doritos in the opening moments of Hempfest on Saturday.<br /><br />It’s the second day of the largest pro-marijuana festival on the waterfront of downtown Seattle. Boy, does the Seattle PD’s public relations crew know how to get attention.<br /><br />“We knew it going to popular locally but we had no idea it was going to be such a explosive story,” said Sean Whitcomb, who handed out some of the Doritos.<br /><br />“I know there’s something about police handing out delicious snacks at a festival that celebrates pot, but this is Seattle so we kind of expect anything to happen. We’re just doing our jobs here. We to make sure people know what the rules are. This is part of an ongoing public relations campaign and, well, we have some creative people in our office,” Whitcomb said.<br /><br />Roy from Everett was one of the first to get the Doritos. He said, “Oh, I think it’s a nice way to let everyone know about the new laws and all that. It’s pretty friendly. I think it’s pretty nice of them to do.”<br /><br />“I think it’s kind of cool, to be perfectly honest, that they’re that accepting and that open about it,” said Erin from Spanaway.<br /><br />His friend chimed in: “It’s beautiful, man. It’s real nice.”<br /><br /><br />“When I saw the Doritos (news) I thought it was a really cool way because paper fliers just get thrown away. We came last year and papers were in gutters all the way around – Doritos are going to get eaten,” said Erin Bartley from Kellogg, Idaho.<br /><br />Related stories:<br /><br />Seattle Hempfest scenes: ‘This isn’t just about being high this is about changing reality …’<br />Seattle Hempfest: ‘Look at what all these lazy stoners did’<br />New gate offers access point to Hempfest<br />Seattle Hempfest 2013

				I wonder if Fritolay donated those for the giveaway. Surely they know people smoking weed results in more of their products being consumed. So an interesting pr move?

				Nope, the cops fronted the bill from their pockets. <br /><br />they only had about 1000 bags and got them for a great deal. they spent about $150 bucks and received a lot of positive feedback in return. Definitley worth it for them
