				I have been unable to login or access the SR site at all except for a couple times in the past few days, and only for a very short period of time. It is leaving me with no orders and unable to communicate with customers who are sending me messages. I was finally able to access the site and reply to one message a little while ago but now back to now access. I can get on these forums if I keep trying but the SR site is much more difficult. I am not sure what to do as this is obviously some gov&#039;t sponsored and well coordinated cyber attack. I would like to use BMR but I am very unsure about their security as compared to SR. <br /><br />I wanted to get some feedback from other vendors/mods/admins/etc on whether it is a safe alternative to use until these SR issues subside? This is my primary source of income but I do not want to risk the safety of either me or my customers. Any feedback would be appreciated.

				There is no evidence or proof that this is government sponsored.&nbsp; There are reputable SR vendors on BMR.&nbsp; I can tell you that.

				BMR has always had problems that would counteract it being safe to use. Then again, I could say that Silk Road is not safe to use, but we do anyway.... carefully. Knowing that there is no backup if there is an issue with a vendor. The problem with BMR has always been with scammers, just like on SR, they exist but b/c of the lower vendor&#039;s acc./ fee they thrive to the extent they can pull out after only a handful of scams. <br /><br />b/c of this it has a reputation for scammers and as such, potential customers are therefore more unwilling to place an order. You need to factor that in with the lower setup cost.<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I bought stuff through BMR a few times in the past, all orders arrived.<br />The site is up for quite a long time. I&#039;d say it&#039;s safe, although there have been speculations (on SR&#039;s forums, mind you. Conspiracy central :P) that BMR is a LE honey-pot.
