				buy a greeting card, place the lucy inside.&nbsp; then address it to your g&#039;ma or whoever, and put a stamp on the envelope.&nbsp; if they ask why you have it, and haven&#039;t mailed it already, explain that her b&#039;day is coming up, while you&#039;re on your trip, and you want to mail it at the right time, in a couple days.&nbsp; they can&#039;t open it, stamped mail is a federal issue. they won&#039;t call a fed over a birthday card.

I don&#039;t know about you, but my tolerance couldn&#039;t handle that much at once. They&#039;d probable call the men in white coats to get me as soon as we landed hahaha. maybe wrap it in a plastic baggy first but I like the cell phone idea. Behind the battery sounds good with the phone off. If you wound up wanting to use your phone just make a bathroom trip and take out your cid and put it in your wallet or under your foot in your sock. There again, wrapped in a plastic baggie or foil for that. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d want anything to draw attention to myself in public like that. Possibilities of pupil dilation or no-reason sweating would alert some of the nosy on lookers

				Ive traveled three times domestic and international w/ L Each time it was in a book that i put through the x ray as a separate part of my carry-on. One time it was the only piece of carry on I had. No one will think twice and it doesnt smell. They have no reason to look in it once its xrayed. Plus its a book and theres a bunch of business people that have a book or magazine in carry on seperate so they can read. Just tell them its that novel youve been working on.. hah but for real you shouldnt have any worries or problems.
