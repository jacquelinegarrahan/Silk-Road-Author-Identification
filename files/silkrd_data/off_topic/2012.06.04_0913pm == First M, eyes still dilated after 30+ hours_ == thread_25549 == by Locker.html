				First of, these last days have been pretty much the best of my life! Like i said in a last post i decided to get a couple of Triforces, got them on Friday, no problem.<br />Decided to roll in my room (Would save it for a rave or something but i really couldn&#039;t wait, will have to get another few for one&nbsp; ::)), took half of my first pill (around 100mg) at around 5ish, took another half at 6:30, and a whole pill at 8 (was going for a big first time 8)). Tbh, this might have been a &#039;bit&#039; too much&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />And man, its hard just to type! I literally just layed on my bed with these on repeat (Cheers for suggesting songs aswell)<br />[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2WuAPfaapY]<br />[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm_6U-MWmXk]<br />waving my arms around like mad for 5 hours straight!!&nbsp; Couldn&#039;t believe how it affected me really, after having a life of just smoking did not except something like that.<br /><br />After the peak had ended, i was just buzzing on my bed listening to some bob marley, and mainly this on repeat for hours&nbsp; &gt;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYVlAv6Cek&lt;&lt;.<br />In total, the whole thing must have lasted for around 15 hours with no sleep, again though, best night of my life!<br /><br />My problem is this though; I took my first half around 30ish hours ago, and just walked past a mirror and man, apart from looking rough as, my eyes are still fucking huge. im not feeling it anymore, and have work in the morning so if they are still like it I&#039;ll be coming in sunglasses, in the hope that i will be allowed to wear them.<br />Is this normal? Is there a way to get rid of dilated eyes? (something i might already have, not some random chemical that will be impossible for me to get&nbsp; :P) Or will they go down overnight, because its a dead giveway atm.<br /><br />Either way,&nbsp; best night of my life!<br /><br />Locker.

				Lol trust me it&#039;s not a dead giveaway, it doesn&#039;t mean shit. Otherwise my whole life would be fucked, because my eyes have been dilated since I was 7. The giveaway is the paranoia vibes you give off thinking to yourself &#039;oh shit they know they know they knowwww&#039;, I&#039;ve had too many friends basically give themselves away just from paranoia.

				My eyes stay dilated for about 3 days so I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. I&#039;m quite tall and a large guy so it&#039;s got nothing to do with body mass or metabolism.<br /><br />Don&#039;t worry people won&#039;t notice if you aren&#039;t still high mentally, people notice your behavior not your eyes unless you&#039;re just outside a club.

				You&#039;ll be fine in the morning.<br /><br />If you have any opiates lying around, those might help.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t recommend it.

				If someone actually notices and asks about your pupils, just say something like &quot;I went to the eye doctor yesterday&quot; or &quot;my doctor put me on an SSRI, which causes pupil dilation&quot;.&nbsp; However, no one has ever mentioned the size of my pupils, and they&#039;re almost ALWAYS huuuuuuuge!
