I&#039;m with you on most of the pill companies being scams. I&#039;ve been looking into it though, and they have a company called Vig RX that looks real legit. Their products have actually been independently tested in multiple clinical trials. Still don&#039;t plan on shelling the money out right away, but once I get the stock portfolio a lot better and have some serious dividends coming in it might be something to splurge on.
