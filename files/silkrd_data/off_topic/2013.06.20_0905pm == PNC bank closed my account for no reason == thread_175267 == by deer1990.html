				they wouldnt give a reason I called and they told me that when I opened my account, the agreement stated they have the right to close my account at any time without providing a reason. im wondering if it was because I was depositing to much money and withdrawling it through dwolla. the deposits never were over like 2 grand though.

				PNC basically considers any large purchases on bitcoin related sites and continuous large deposits to be suspicious activity...&nbsp; I just &quot;work&quot; for a business owner and he pays whatever I give him to my account.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how you would go about the whole dwolla thing without raising some eyebrows, but I usually just do face to face btc tranactions.&nbsp; Maybe you should look into some new methods&nbsp; ;D

				If they&#039;ve found your activity to be suspicious then they were legally obligated to report it.
