				Hello everyone, I was just wondering how many people under 18 were using SR, what everyone&#039;s opinions were about that age area, I noticed some discussion about it in another thread where some were saying kids shouldn&#039;t be messing with SR and it&#039;s a big risk factor not knowing about Tor and security. My thoughts, well, meaning &quot;kids&quot;, I&#039;m talking about high school+ so within the age range of 15-18 is mainly what I meant. I think if they know what they&#039;re doing and are smart about their actions then it shouldn&#039;t matter. I started using SR when I was almost 16 (I haven&#039;t started being active on the forums until recently), I&#039;m probably gonna get shit for that but it&#039;s being honest and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a ton of others younger than me on here for sure, and having a right experience when trying different substances along with tons of research and help from sites like Bluelight and Erowid, along with the SR forums is the right way to start if you plan on doing anything. Even when I was 14 or so and was planning on smoking weed for the first time, I did a ton of research on Erowid to get an idea of how I was going to feel. Before trying anything else since that point, I&#039;d read over 100 sources about each substance I planned on taking. Not going to keep rambling or post my whole life story involving drugs, but I will mention I&#039;ve always imagined myself growing up homeless and addicted to something &quot;heavy&quot; such as meth, I never knew why but I always had an urge to feel good and get away from reality without the thought of consequences. SR and research changed my view on everything, I&#039;ve tried numerous different things without developing any addictions and I owe this all to places like Erowid, Bluelight, and even though I didn&#039;t have access to it at the time, SR forums is a big help to me now as well.&nbsp; Silk Road in my opinion is a more efficient way of trying anything, cleaner drugs, and if they have the ability to access it in the first place, I&#039;d guess they&#039;d know to do a good amount of research on what they&#039;re doing. It makes the future look pretty good in my opinion. <br /><br />I say this with almost everything I post, but I&#039;m so sorry for going off-topic and rambling, I get sidetracked extremely easily and go on and on.

				I wonder if I&#039;m the only one who remembers being young at around age 8, and telling myself &quot;I&#039;ll never do drugs, smoke, or drink.&quot; then now ending up on SR, kind of sad but at least I try my best to be responsible about it, everyone should be when it comes to your health in any way. Teenagers growing up learning about drugs and making their own choices in a better route of safety rather than friends/media influencing them to do something for fun without thinking about researching in my opinion. It&#039;s better to learn from yourself. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=72939.msg595867#msg595867">Quote from: ttd on November 16, 2012, 04:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whatever my opinion on minors being here, we can&#039;t keep them out anyway because the government has forced us all to use anonymous payment, communication and shipping methods.

It all comes down to being aware of what could happen with anything, addiction, overdose, responsibility is the most important when it comes to any of that. Proper dosing, safe trips, and telling yourself to not start an addiction, I don&#039;t believe in that anyways and I think it&#039;s just a mind trick craving pleasure, all addiction leads to is withdrawals and an empty wallet. x)<br /><br />

				I really wish they wouldn&#039;t. It&#039;s not that I think they can&#039;t make their own decisions or anything. But if they live with their parents and a package gets opened by them, it could lead to very bad things. I know when I was a kid drugs were barely a thought. I always knew I wanted to try psychedelics, but I never even saw weed until I was 20 years old, who knows if silkroad was around when I was a kid there was a good chance I would&#039;ve checked it out.

				My friend and I smoked weed for the first time when I was 12. I grew up to have a better job than all the good kids who never used drugs in my class.<br /><br />I also ordered a bunch of packages from ebay when I was a teenager, it wasn&#039;t uncommon for me to get mail.<br /><br />So anecdotally it&#039;s entirely possible for a responsible teen to use SR, with essentially the same level of risk as anyone else.
