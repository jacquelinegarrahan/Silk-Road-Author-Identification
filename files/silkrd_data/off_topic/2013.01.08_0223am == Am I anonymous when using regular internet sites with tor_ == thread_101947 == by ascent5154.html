				Am I anonymous when using regular internet sites through the tor browser. For example, using the google search engine. This assumes that I don&#039;t access emails or put any of my personal information over the internet. I ask this because sometimes when people post a link they write, &quot;warning this is a clearnet site&quot;.

				Yes. <br /><br />Some sites block access from the Tor network tho, it is also going to be slower than your regular &quot;clearnet&quot; browser

				There are specific attacks that identify Tor users based on statistical correlations in network traffic, and accessing clearnet sites makes them easier to perform.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never seen a confirmed instance of these attacks being performed in the wild, as it were -- only in controlled lab environments.&nbsp; That doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t happening every day, of course, but what I&#039;m saying is that I consider it such a small risk as to be negligible.&nbsp; Your opinion is your own.

Basically, use a very stripped down browser when surfing.

				So, if you&#039;re trying to install Flash so that you can watch brazzers anonymously... ;)<br /><br />Just kidding, but seriously, there was a guy who proposed attacks be used to monitor content handled by the exit servers--the computers that manage the border between the Tor network and the Internet--to their source, in order to find child-pornographers. Tor operators criticized the project as endangering the vast majority of legitimate Tor users to pursue a smaller number of bad actors.
