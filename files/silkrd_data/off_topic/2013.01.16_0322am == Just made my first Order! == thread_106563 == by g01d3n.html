				@rosannebar I did at first, but I do believe I PGPed correctly, so I&#039;m not too &quot;oh ship&quot; about it. I&#039;m dealing with a very reputable vendor, so I&#039;m trusting him to shred my information :D

				Haha, I&#039;ve placed some orders a while ago (of course with another account), just to see if they really arrives.<br />Some orders did arrive and some didn&#039;t, but those which did arrive let me totally forget about those which didn&#039;t.<br />But in the end, I love Silk Road.
