				Might be worth a look? These type of documentaries usually are either very good or very, very bad! I remember one years ago were they gave a bunch of guys LSD, and one of them climbed a tree whilst the others couldn&#039;t stop laughing. <br /><br />MIXMAG<br />&quot;On Wednesday September 26 Channel 4 will broadcast Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial, the first of a two-part series of programmes documenting the effects of ecstasy on a group of adults. <br />The shows are based on a research project conducted by Professor David Nutt, the founder of The Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs and former government advisor who was dismissed after challenging the re-classification of cannabis from a Class C to a Class B drug. <br />Nutt is typically very outspoken and this morning he appeared on BBC Radio 4&#039;s The Life Scientific, where he was discussing new research projects as well as Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial.<br />He described the programmes as &quot;a serious documentary on the science of MDMA.&quot;<br />&quot;It isn&#039;t just about our experiment, it&#039;s about the broader issues... they&#039;ll all be properly evaluated,&quot; he added.<br />The Channel 4 broadcast will be hosted by Jon Snow and Dr Christian Jessen and looks set to explore ecstasy beyond its use as a party drug. <br />Nutt also said: &quot;No one has actually found out what ecstacy does in the brain, why it makes people feel empathetic, why kids use it.&quot;<br />Participants on the show include former MP Evan Harris, actor Keith Allen and novellist Lionel Shriver.&quot;<br />
