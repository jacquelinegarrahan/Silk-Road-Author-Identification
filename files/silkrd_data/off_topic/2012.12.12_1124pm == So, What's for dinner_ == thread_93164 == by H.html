				Oh, I just love to smoke a little bit of Sativa before cooking, to get all the &#039;creative juices&#039; flowing. Then when I&#039;m done, I smoke a bit more Sativa and put on some good music, to.... <br /><br />Clean up the mess I&#039;ve created(lol).<br /><br />Then I continue with smoking a fair amount of a nice hybrid(mostly Indica dominant.). <br /><br />At that point I&#039;m high as a kite and I start kind of &quot;daydreaming&quot;. I usually play it in my head like I&#039;m top chef or a critique and I start judging the food, lol. (Call me crazy, but that&#039;s fun as HELL, for me, at least.)<br /><br />After all that, I usually end it with watching a nice new episode of something, that I have available at that moment. :P<br /><br />That&#039;s my usual(perfect) home alone. :)<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I made myself a chicken and fried rice dish with a tomato and red pepper sauce. Was amazin&#039;. <br />I love to cook though, winds me down after a long day and its satisfying eating your own freshly prepared food. :)<br />No drugs on the menu tonight though.. ::)

				Since I was rolling and tripping my tits off yesterday, my stomach is a bit iffy (and my mouth messed up!), I kept it simple. Lentils with honey.<br /><br />Tomorrow it will be roasted fennel with Gorgonzola (blue cheese). Probably with a piece of pork loin.
