				When I was a new user I got one that had an extremely unique word in it.&nbsp; The whole name of a street not too far from my house.&nbsp; Never seen/heard of that street anywhere else.&nbsp; It was safe to say I was trippin, and freaking the fuck out a little bit.&nbsp; coincidences....

				Actually, every captcha had a word or at least the beginning of a word in it.&nbsp; I&#039;ve got a rather significant vocabulary so I recognize even unusual words.&nbsp; Open a dictionary and look up the letters, it&#039;s a word.&nbsp; I&#039;ve actually read that a lot of captchas are used to convert books into printed works.&nbsp; They scan the picture, obscure it a bit, and have people enter it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I dunno how well that would actually work as it seems like they&#039;d need the whole printed work anyways to verify that the captcha was entered correctly.&nbsp; Anywho...
