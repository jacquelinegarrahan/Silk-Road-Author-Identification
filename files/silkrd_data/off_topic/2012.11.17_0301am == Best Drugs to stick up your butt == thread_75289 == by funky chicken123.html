				Anything you can dissolve in water and put in a syringe.<br /><br />Krystal Cole gives a riveting description of doing DMT up the bum on youtube lol (dumb cunt named &#039;neurosoup&#039;).&nbsp; If you don&#039;t know who that is, she&#039;s one of William Pickard&#039;s slutbunnies who lived in an abandoned missle silo in Kansas.&nbsp; Pickard was arrested sadly as being the largest LSD manufacturer in history, he made a kg of pure LSD every 5 weeks&nbsp; :o
