				I have read on quite a few threads that guys have trouble getting it up on MDMA. I am not into the rave culture but do enjoy some occasional MDMA for a nice relaxing evening at home. I give my wife a great full body massage then we have the most amazing sex. Oh yea this happened tonight too btw! Of coarse it was combined with some of TBF&#039;s fine BUKU.

				My sexual stimulant of choice is crack, and it&#039;s probably for the best that I never have anyone to share it with :)<br /><br />Otherwise, whatever I take (and I&#039;ve rarely used any illegal substance aside from cannabis more than a few days in a row), my wanking frequency seems to normalise within a few days.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=215765.msg1574789#msg1574789">Quote from: cryngie on September 30, 2013, 01:33 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=215765.msg1573935#msg1573935">Quote from: Cornelius23 on September 29, 2013, 05:05 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Heroin is physically addictive.

It also takes forever to &quot;finish&quot; which can be awesome too.<br />Cannabis defiantly does too. I get excited for some strange shit on edibles. The crazier or weirder it is the more awesome (with some exceptions).<br />25c wasn&#039;t great.<br />That&#039;s all I can think of.

				Speed makes my orgasms insane. I can go on for a long time and when I finally cum, my body shakes uncontrollably for like 10 seconds straight and the amount of cum is insane (at least the first round), it&#039;s better than any orgasm I can achieve otherwise. My sex drive increases tenfold too, so I&#039;m ready to go again shortly after. Sex on MDMA is a good number runner-up, cannabis also enhances the experience.

I fucked forever and shot the biggest load of my life on meth. Longterm morphine will kill your sex drive I&#039;ve been taking 400+ mg daily for extreme arthritis for a few years and my girl has to beg me to have sex and i never jack off anymore. Not sure about heroin since it is related but i am talking about longtime heavy use.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I am on SR. I quit meth years ago but i want some so i can be horny again and fuck the shit out of my girlfriend and make her happy.

Feels like your dick is pulsing. You just NEED to have sex.<br />On meth, even just starting the sex is amazing. You get a huge headrush and you have a sort of pre-orgasm that lasts for about 30 seconds which feels like an orgasm, then an actual orgasm afterwards which is a whole lot better again and lasts like ages and you shoot out like&nbsp; litre. Lol<br /><br />Mephedrone is different again. Probably not as good as methamphetamine for sex, but you feel more conected to the person (that&#039;d be because of the MDMA-like (serotonin-relesing) feeling.
