				Alright so I fucked up. I got scammed out of $600 of not my money. My mistake was clearly that i didnt use SR. The original plan was to borrow some money to get me started then start buying weed at wholesale prices through tor and then sell it on the street here. Where I live the best dank is shitty compared to what&#039;s available elsewhere. But now I&#039;m trying to get together enough to buy an oz (ish) of good weed for as cheap as possible. I&#039;m looking for the cheapest option available that you would feel comfortable selling (or buying) for $20/g, or whatever the standard price is in your area. I can get maybe as much as $250-$300 together for this buy. Please help me out guys I really need a few recommendations here.

				Pro-tip: Be as honest as possible with the people who fronted you the cash. If you ignore them, they&#039;ll be freaking out and wondering what&#039;s going on with their money. If you lie to them you dig yourself a deeper hole. Being honest with your suppliers and financiers is really the best way to go about it. All that you have in the drug sales game is trust and respect, and without giving that respect to your suppliers and financiers, and being completely honest - giving them a reason to trust you - you&#039;ll definitely end up in trouble somewhere down the line.<br /><br />As for very high quality weed at low prices, check out Anarcho47&#039;s White Widow:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/7181<br /><br />I&#039;ve never bought from Anarcho47 myself, but going on literally everybody else&#039;s reviews and comments, he&#039;s your man.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Haha its good to see I&#039;m doing something right. The first person I told was my business partner and the second was my investor haha. Then within an hour of figuring out what happened I came here. The funny part is that my investor, an old friend, wasn&#039;t too concerned after I told him I still had a plan (that would be you guys and $250 out of pocket), but my partner started freaking out lol. Thanks for the quick response I&#039;ll check him out.

				Good to hear!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If both your investor and partner were speculators, your investor would likely be the &#039;long&#039; speculator, and your partner the &#039;short&#039; - the short speculator freaking out at the slightest bit of bad news, and the long-term speculator having enough faith in the commodity (in this case you) to be satisfied that he&#039;ll get a decent return on his investment. Long speculator&#039;s do better, more often than not, so don&#039;t let him down!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />How did you get scammed, if you don&#039;t mind my asking?<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				Honestly I&#039;d rather not say haha. It was pretty dumb of me though. I&#039;ll be sticking to trusted SR vendors from now on though.

				Wouldn&#039;t it make sense to call out the vendor so other people<br />won&#039;t go down the same road??

So a few weeks ago I started on the whole &quot;tor hidden services&quot; thing, and, like probably most people, I started out on the hidden wiki. I had heard of SR before so when I took a look at the drug trade this was the first place I came, but I didn&#039;t see a whole lot of room for profit at first glance. After going back to THW I started looking at other vendors that would allow me to buy weed at wholesale prices, and I found Paradoxum. Being new to the whole thing I pretty much assumed everything on THW front page was legit. It wasn&#039;t. Nevertheless I went ahead and checked the 2 review site links on THW and saw nothing but good reviews, but it&#039;s now obvious that they were all Paradoxum. It took a couple weeks to get my bussiness plan in order and get comfortable with all the security methods, but I finally ordered 2oz of trainwreck from Paradoxum on this previous Saturday. Throughout the ordering process I kept thinking there was something wrong with my tormail account because it always seemed like it took a couple emails before he responded, and eventually I went back to check the reviews to see if that was a common theme with him (something I hadn&#039;t done since those first few days of research). By this point I wasn&#039;t the only one who had tried to order from him, and everyone knew he was a complete scammer and I would never receive any product. So yea. Paradoxum is a scammer and don&#039;t ever buy from someone just because they&#039;re on THW and have a few good reviews.<br /><br />TLDR: Paradoxum is a gutless motherfucking scammer and a pussy ass god-damned bitch.
