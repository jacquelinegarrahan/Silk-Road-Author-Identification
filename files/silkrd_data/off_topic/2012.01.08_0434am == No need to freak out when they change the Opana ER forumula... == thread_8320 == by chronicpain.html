				As some of you know, Endo will be changing their ER formula. The main difference is that it will be next to impossible to crush and snort. (much more difficult than the OP&#039;s)<br /><br />They are supposed to change the formula at the beginning of the year, so, it could happen any time. I dont think that anyone needs to worry about it.<br /><br />1. Endo will be able to extend the patent on the new Tamper Resistant Formula til 2023 <br />2. Endo loses patent protection on the old school opana&#039;s timerx system sometime this year. (So, there will be generics made that we are all used to.)<br />3. Even with the new tamper resistant formula, you can bypass it by letting it soak for a few hours as oxymorphone is very water soluable. Let dry, separate and you actually have a better product. (Just heard about this, havent had any first hand knowledge.)<br /><br />I read that the new pills will look the same as the old ones, shape, color etc. I have heard a rumor that they (endo) will still make the old school.<br /><br />I just wonder when they are going to switch them. Are they going to do it when their patent runs out and generics are made? or are they going to pull the old school opanas and replace with the new formula asap?<br /><br />Basically, when this happens, worse case scenerio is that it will take a bit more time to prepare. Or the vendors can do it. break it down and sell it as a powder. If this was done, would it bother anyone? (as long as the buyer knew what was up before purchasing?)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t seen much talk about the new opanas, so, I thought I would get one going..

				Not really my thing but thought I&#039;d try and help by doing a bit of digging, rumours on the internet seem to say around mid-2012 they&#039;ll switch..

				thanks for the heads up, seems like overall good news though with the generics coming through<br /><br />As for vendors reducing the pills down to &#039;prepared&#039; powder, im sure this would suit some people great.<br />for me; knowing exactly what yourve got in your hand and how much of it is what makes the price of pharms over heroin acceptable

Terms like silicosis and Pneumoconiosis have made me a little weary of my favorite hobby recently.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a separate note, I really hope to see some Opana up on the market soon cause I&#039;m really craving some relaxation.&nbsp; 8)&nbsp;
