				Hi, I have just searched through my country&#039;s law database and found, that this is still legal here (and 3,4-mmc is sadly not:). The reviews on the intertubes are very conflicting. Some say this is even better than mdma, some say it&#039;s awful. However everyone mentioned they had hard time sleeping afterward (this is a serious drawback, that&#039;s why I hated amphetamine). I&#039;m thinking on stocking for a year, or so with methylone (I fear it will be made illegal here soon), so thought about giving a try on this one. But it&#039;s about 2x the price of methylole + all these sleep problems are giving me second thoughts. By the way, while we are on the topic - what other RC&#039;s are similar to methylone/mephedrone? <br />found only 2 that are something like that. The desired effects are: stimulant effect (sobering), emphatic (would be a bonus:), no problems with sleep afterwards (would be awesome).. I do have some problems with sleep after mdma/m1/metylone, but they are minor ones - if I go to bed to early (not all the effects are over) - I can&#039;t sleep for some time, but have a good time thinking about stuff:) - dreams are interesting, but no this amphetamine &#039;lol, your are thinking about sleep mate - forget it, let&#039;s sweat like a pig for next 4 hours and feel shitty for 10 hours afterward;)<br />MDAI? <br />4-FMA?<br /><br />thanks in advance
