				Can some explain to me why mushrooms grow wild in muddy fields/roadsides and happily sprout beside farm animal shit yet if they&#039;re grown inside the recommendation is to do it in a sterile environment?&nbsp; What am I missing?

				. .&nbsp; Because the same food they eat is also the same food that killer bacteria and viruses also eat. <br />So, you grow shrooms but under the shrooms is a bit of bacteria that can kill you (samonilla) and it actually spreads inside all the mushrooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;Creating killer mushrooms. <br /><br />Ever get nauseous from shrooms?&nbsp; It&#039;s because of the extra bacteria (green mold called trich) that the grower left on them.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, when you grow shrooms you also inadvertently grow samonilla, the cold and flu virus, SARS, etc.&nbsp; whatever is floating around your house in the air. <br /><br />Outdoor shrooms are protected by the naturally occur in molds and bacteria in the outdoors.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s when you bring them indoors that you create a breeding ground for bacteria to grow. <br />

				My spores arrived today, I&#039;ll be getting started soon so I&#039;ve been re-reading.<br /><br />Basically the psylocybe bearing mushrooms would normally be in a less competitive environment, for example with liberty caps they are in an open area free to find their best suited area. Other mushrooms and moulds grow where they feel best and everyones happy.<br /><br />When making spore cakes you are just making a culture for ANY mould to grow on and you&#039;re just trying to get one in particular to infect it.<br /><br />Sorry, I&#039;m really tired and depressed but I hope that makes sense<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Thanks for the answers, it makes sense now in a bizarre way.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never had indoor grown mushroom, only those I&#039;ve gone out and picked and the worst thing that ever happens to me is a stomach cramp before the trip starts to bloom.&nbsp; <br /><br />/me gives the doctor a hug and hopes you feel better soon.<br />

				I have the finest concentrate I have ever made purging in the vacuum chamber, it&#039;s turning to honeycomb so I&#039;ll feel a lot better when thats ready!<br /><br />It looks and smells amazing, I can&#039;t fucking wait and it&#039;s just the first few grams.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a lot of harvesting to do as well as a hit of acid(1st time) so I think it&#039;s going to be a good/hectic weekend.<br /><br />Then I start farming mushrooms as soon as the few last bits of equipment get here, I&#039;ve gone for Golden Teachers and I can&#039;t wait.<br /><br />I&#039;m starting to cheer up a bit now I have some liquid gold purging, this stuff is going to blow my tiny mind...<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				Cakes are ok for a first time I suppose, thats how I started but you don&#039;t get many dried grams per cake.<br /><br />Once you use rye grain in a deep turkey roasting pan and rubbermaid bins you&#039;ll never go back :) <br /><br />Eat them fresh for an extra kick tho I personally hate the taste so I always make tea.

				How does one sterilise a larger tray for innoculation? I&#039;m starting some cakes but have been wondering this.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been using the classic pressure cooker/jar set up but I&#039;d like some larger cakes so any advice would be appreciated<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I soak my verm then microwave it to kill contams but u can use oven as well, I also spray the air with lysol and the tray itself before I put vermiculite on bottom then crumble contents of 2 large jars on top, more verm on top. Cover with tinfoil. Let sit covered usually 7-9 days. Once ready I move tray into rubbermaids prepared with perlite etc. <br /><br />I am a bit tied up today until later tonight but more than willing to help if I can later on :)

				Thanks, that&#039;s appreciated, I&#039;ve been doing some clearnet research and I think I&#039;m getting the hang of it.<br /><br />I&#039;m sticking with the straight PFtek for 4 cakes but then I might try something like that for another 4.<br /><br />Any special recommendations for Golden Teachers or are they just like the other B+&#039;s?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help, just let me know if you ever want weed related advice.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				how are you going to fruit them, I had lots of trouble with tereriums, found the best way was to keep the cakes in the jars and let them fruit, harvest, soak in water for an hour, put back in jar, then the cakes shrink so there is more room for them to grow, keep the jars upside down for air ventilation.

				I plan on taking the sterilised PFtek colonised jars and putting them in a shotgun flowering chamber after a dunk to let them fruit out.<br /><br />I think with the other tek link I posted you just flower out in the tub you mix it in.<br /><br />Basically for a shotgun terrarium you take a large plasic tank, cut 2 small holes at the substrate level on the long sides and 2 holes at the top on the short sides to force airflow.<br /><br />You need to allow for 2-3 inches of soaked perlite in the bottom of the tank, this provides the humidity base and forces airflow<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

Don&#039;t eat way too much Mexican food an hour before you munch mushrooms, it&#039;s not going to end well, I know this from experience. But everyone is different, and every trip is different, and sometimes anxiety can manifest as stomach troubles. Anyway...
