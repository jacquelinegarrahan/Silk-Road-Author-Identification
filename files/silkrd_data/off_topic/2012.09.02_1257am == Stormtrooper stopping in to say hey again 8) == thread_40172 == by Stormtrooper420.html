				It&#039;s actually been pretty shitty in my opinion, Sollemnis came back healthy fortunately, however TT&#039;s snapped and has made it her life goal to harass the VD gang and there&#039;s fucking bullshit MtGix spam to deal with everyday. Furthermore Lim &amp; Guru have been promoted to Spam Busters which means they&#039;re entrusted to delete accounts and whatnot so most trolling has stopped but all of these newer members are stupid so it doesn&#039;t mean shit when there&#039;s no real discussions to be trolled anyways. :-\

				Man... this fucking site. So many assholes around! And I am looking through prices and it seems like everything is even more stupidly expensive. Glad to see some familiar faces though :) There just really needs to be a seperate SR for actual SR members, not dumbasses lol. It seems like everybody is starting to care a lot less about security e.e And I really don&#039;t like the new look either. There is just so much negative to this place now its really dissapointing :/ Yall need to try to keep up the positive though :)<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Stormtrooper

Also connecting to the site&#039;s a bitch compared to what it used to be. &gt;:( I figure once this site goes down the drain I should probably just move to the Czech Republic or Italy so I won&#039;t be bothered in my pursuit of happiness. ;)

Im over a year deep into this place and the only reason I lost money was from someone I knew quite well getting popped in the middle of an RC pick up.
