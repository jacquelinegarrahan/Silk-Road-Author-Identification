				OK, there are a few signs that can help anyone know before purchase that the drug quality is pure shit,<br />When you Either:<br />1. Read a review<br />2. Hear from your Dealer / Vendor<br /><br />One of the following sentences:<br /><br />&quot;its nice euphoric&quot;&nbsp; (meaning: if it was good stuff it would blow your head off)<br /><br />&quot;Its so pure that the effects are mild&quot;&nbsp; (meaning: its so cut with crap its weak and i am hoping your a newbie)<br /><br />&quot;You have to smoke weed till it will come up&quot;&nbsp; (meaning: i hope you will get stoned before you understand you got ripped off)<br /><br />&quot;its a new batch and i did not tried it myself / yet&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(meaning: don&#039;t come crying about the quality)<br /><br />this is what i can recall now...<br />&nbsp;Any other sentences that should alarm you?&nbsp; Post here&nbsp; :o<br />

				I agree. These are diffusion words and vague ways to place a buffer between you and your product. It leaves you wiggle room. Your product should be described as is in my opinion. It&#039;s similar to a police interrogation, you try to distance yourself from the item/incident without seeming guilty, but place suspicion on yourself in the process.
