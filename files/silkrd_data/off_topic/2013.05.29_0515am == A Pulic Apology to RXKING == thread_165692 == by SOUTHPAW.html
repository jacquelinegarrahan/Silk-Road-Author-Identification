				SP...First THANKS...but this was so not needed! Shit happens IRL and you set out to do something and then you can not do it. I get it. It really is not that big a deal. My only point was that is you say you are going to do something and you can not...then you should shoot a message saying you cant do what you said you were going to do...that way you do not leave the other person hangin. In this case...it was not a big deal, you have said your sorry and I accept and it is in the past. Forgive and forget!!<br /><br />I already forgot! No harm no foul.

				Again South paw your welcome...BUT I honestly was never bothered my it...I told you in a pm how I felt...and the issue I had is that you didnt contact me...again I get it..as when I have not been able to do what I have said I would do...and I really liked/respected the person...I did the EXACT same thing as you...and the wrong thing....I was embarrassed....so I just flaked out..and I think that is the normal reaction people have when they say they are going to do something...or they ask for help and then the person says yes...and then when it is time...they can not take the help...so again you &quot;run away&quot;.<br /><br />And because I like you and I respect you and I think you are a good guy...I was stern with you so you would learn what I did....don&#039;t do that! people never get mad with the truth. EVER. They might act mad...but when they cool down...they will respect the fact you let them know ...you could not do it...instead of flaking. And that is all&nbsp; I was trying to say!!! NOW I respect you even more because you&nbsp; went public with something that is just between you and I...and you did that to prove a point to me...that you are really sorry and you meant no disrespect at all. And so you know....I took it at the time as no disrespect...as I 100% knew something came up where you could not do it...I just like you enough to tell you what the right thing is you can do...and that if you just messages me...I would have helped you.<br /><br />But again...you writing this post means a lot...and it shows that even in a forum..where NONE of us know each other...you can make a friend. And you and I have that. <br /><br />And so everyone knows that reads this and cares to know... this was so not a big deal...in the sense of what he was asking for...BUT it was a big deal in the sense on here...as a vendor..one of the worst things you can do is ask for or tell a vendor you are going to do something...then not only do you not do it...but you send no message and you vanish for a week.<br /><br />So he asked me if I could do him a favor and sell him $200 worth of btc.. for those of you that do not know...I do only over 500 and for 99% I do $990 and I do multiple ones for people...like 4+ up to 15. And I cover all WU fees and I sell the coin at the exact rate it is on SR. I have been doing it for 1 year...Just stopped actually yesterday..pretty ironic....and for me to do such a little amount cost me money..as I have to pay people to pull this of...well when I am doing 5-15k....the fee is nothing.when I have to do $200 it cost me $40 and it takes time away from my guys doing other things...and overall it is just a total pain in the ass...and that&#039;s why I only do the over $850&#039;s and&nbsp; like I said...most are 990 and are multiple...so he asked very nicely with a long message explaining why...and of course I said yes...he told me it would be the next day...and the next day he was no where to be found and didn&#039;t return messages or anything and vanished for like a week. So not the end of the world...and as I said...it bothered me more that he flaked...when we are &quot;friends&quot; on here and all he had to do is contact me....but he was embarrassed and he didn&#039;t..and as I said above..I totally understand why as I have done it...so he sent me a message after like 5 days...saying he was sorry...I accepted and I moved on...well he is a CLASS guy and he decided that was not enough...and he wanted to publicly say what he did...and not say the why he is saying it so i would totally understand he really is sorry.<br /><br />Well as I told you all...he is a great guy...and he showed it...as he has in the past..and I publicly want him to know..that I forgive and forget ..and this is NOTHING...and I know that in the future...if he can not do something he says he will then he will just tell them and not hide as that just makes him feel worse and the person you tell will totally appreciate it!<br /><br />Btw if you still need coin..pm me...I will work something out!<br /><br />Now NO MORE of this public shit! your my bot just pm me on SR! And realize that next time you need a favor..I will say yes again...just make sure and get it!!! :P
