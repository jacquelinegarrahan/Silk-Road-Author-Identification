				Yo,<br /><br />I want to design a perfect Molly pill, not pure MDMA, but with one or two other ingredients to enhance the experience.<br /><br />Does anyone have a formula or concoction for mixing some other stuff or stacking a few things over a night to make an evening of MDMA keep on truckin&#039; and being awesome?<br /><br />I feel like a little buzzy high like weed or coke at the same time as you drop the MDMA would be good to get you past the weird part in the beginning where you feel a stomach ache and anticipation nervousness. Then after the first couple of hours of fun starts to want, maybe some other drug like MDA? (I have no idea what that is) OR whatever, or alcohol or another half hit of MDMA? Maybe I just need to take another hit after 4 hours or something.<br /><br />Anyone feel me out there? Come on Ravers and Festival folk. Let&#039;s hear from you.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Modzi<br />

				Id say mdma/mda combo is quite good without too much more paying for it the next day. <br /><br />But in all actuality most people want the chill-ness of mdma alone. I personally like more. I no longer get enjoyment out of mdma alone. Now if im gonna roll im gonna flip. I do not have fun on mdma alone. Its just used to enhance other drugs. Id say you could conjure up &#039;Hippie flips&#039; Say something like 100mg mdma and 25mg of 4-aco-dmt. But you would need to inform that they should only take it for the starting dose. Another good mix is the one that has been used, and used again. speed and mdma. But i also think that this should only be the first dose. Being that i used to abuse mdma and i know how most users are they just keep taking it threw the night. This would not be very good for the next day.<br /><br />the mda/mdma combo provides me with just enough energy. It makes me dance harder go for longer, and needless to say have more fun. But it is a little more taxing on the body. <br /><br />Your best bet is mda/mdma combo.<br /><br />you could also look into stuff that calms the stomach. Ive always though about throwing in ginger, or cinnamon. ive always known them to calm the stomach. Also, ive though about throwing in beneficial vitamins in caps so people can roll a little bit safer. But i have yet to do that.

				Just take mescaline.&nbsp; It&#039;ll give you everything you desire and last much longer..... 8)<br /><br />Outside of that I have candyflipped, hippyflipped, kittyflipped, etc and they are all worth trying IMO.<br /><br />Be careful on reupping the does of MDMA/MDA after a period of time.&nbsp; Not good for your brain and the effects will be minimal.&nbsp; I advise just taking more up front if you&#039;d like a little more.<br /><br />Then when you&#039;re coming down from the roll and ready to chill out, break out some lines of kitty and put yourself into a nice relaxing trance.

				Thanks guys. I find that taking half a soma after - when I am ready to sleep - keeps me from having any headaches or neck aches when I wake up.<br /><br />I think I will take a bigger MDMA dose next time.<br /><br />Maybe try with MDA when I get bored of that.<br /><br />And I only do it every month and a half.<br /><br />Modzi

				A little 2CB towards the end of the roll is highly thought of!

				MDA/MDMA gets me amazing fucked up, more fun than either of those drugs on their own.<br /><br />For the typical consumer who likes to party the perfect pill would contain a small amount of speed (to get them off the couch and in party mode), a medium dose of MDA and a slightly larger dose of MDMA. Also those chemicals combine in a very pleasant, non-dangerous way.<br /><br />You could throw trippy shit in the mix but a lot of people don&#039;t like that kind of stuff.

				Lol take 1200ug tab of 25i Nbome 20 mins before taking the ecstasy pill, you will probably have the best rush ever. Then kick fucking start x10 by smoking some weed. When coming down smoke a bit more weed, but the NBOMe will still be in effect, I dunno. This could be dangerous but in all honesty I think its ok. MDMA and 25i are phenethalymines, and I wouldnt think the comedown would be too bad, maybe have benzos or indica strain to smoke to sleep :)<br /><br />If experts know this is a bad combo then dont :p

				naw i mean the whole combo 25i + mdma and weed, I doubt it is would be bad but I mean mixing 25i which the long term effects are still unknown... responsible use with anything should be ok:)
