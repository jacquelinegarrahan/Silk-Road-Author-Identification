				...when pure MDMA is available?&nbsp; I don&#039;t get it.&nbsp; it seems like sellers tout that their pills are &quot;100% MDMA&quot; but its more expensive than just buying the mdma powder/crystals.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyone care to explain their preference for pills?

				Selling ecstasy is just easier for me. Without the bother of weighing stuff out and using a scale,&nbsp; And when I get pills from SKYY I know that they are clean. So basically im selling Molly pills. Some people would rather just take Molly in pressed pill form than snort or parachute some Molly

				In a club/festival the people want caps and pills to easily carry and swallow. You make more money selling pills too.<br />Buy some pure MDMA, buy some gelcaps from a natural foods place, fill with whatever dose you want. <br />

				The way i see it, when you sell MDMA to someone, who knows if they&#039;re gonna crush the crystals to a powder and cut it? <br /><br />Pills can be cut, but they have to be cut by the presser. <br /><br />While I&#039;ve seen/eaten many bullshit pills with cool logos, I&#039;ve also eaten a few pills that were nothing but MDMA and an inactive binder. <br /><br />I like pure MDMA because nice big MDMA crystals have a somewhat distinct physical characteristics, and i properly weigh out my doses, as opposed to a pill, which even if its pure i don&#039;t know how much exactly i&#039;m taking. <br /><br />Theres pure pills and cut pills<br />Theres pure &#039;molly&#039; and cut &#039;molly&#039;<br /><br />Either way MDMA is MDMA and you&#039;re not gonna know 100% without a test kit. <br /><br />http://dancesafe.org/products/testing-kits

				..can&#039;t make me mind up, its sometimes that the pill is a blend of 3 more whereas the purer mdma dropped into a cap for convenience isn&#039;t as diluted hence you throw up.<br />

				I like pills in some cases when they are cut with meth or speed. Since I enjoy speed more than M, I prefer getting pills cut with that. Of course many pills are cut with garbage or are low potency and I don&#039;t like those. <br /><br />If I just want mdma without speed (rarely), then I much prefer the powder.

				i guess I have a different perspective than those who&#039;ve had great rolls off pills.&nbsp; I have indeed had some pretty great pills in my day, but the amount of terrible pills I&#039;ve had outweighs them, in my mind.&nbsp; around where I live, for the last decade or so most of the pills I&#039;ve gotten have been mostly speed (which is something I try to avoid).&nbsp; once I had someone give me a tab of acid and a pill...turned out the acid was amazing but the pill must&#039;ve been straight meth because I sat on the toilet shitting my brains out feeling totally twacked out on crank (muscle spasms and all) through the whole trip.&nbsp; I ended up just laying in my bed waiting for it to end.&nbsp; ugh.<br /><br />most people in my area of the US agree, from what I can tell....in the rave and festie scene, people seem to only offer/ask for molly.<br /><br />sounds like europeans have a much better situation with the pills

				You can buy 500 or 1000 capsules size 0 from amazon for like 10 bucks and make your own crazy concoctions for a lot cheaper, then you can find out what you like way better. Ive been experimenting with mixing MDMA, bk-MDMA, 4-FA, Coke, Speed, 2ce and once with 2cp but it was wayy outta wack.<br /><br />For instance most of my friends like the capsules with 105 mg MDMA and 45 mg 4-FA. Sometimes I use the bk-MDMA and add speed. Great combos.

				Different roll. The press and how densely they&#039;re pressed with the different quality of MDMA makes each roll unique with beans. 180mg cap of molly will be an intense as merked ass roll for ~3hours, whereas one white speaker will last like 7 hours and it&#039;s gonna take your body longer to break down that pressed pill.

For example, the same crystal MDMA Skyy sells, is the same MDMA in his Red Star pills. <br /><br />Rolls can have quality MDMA, they can have low quality MDMA, or no MDMA at all.<br /><br />Same for caps of molly.<br /><br />MDMA is MDMA, no matter what form. The only thing i understand from your post is the idea that pressed pills take longer to break down in the stomach.

				Ok guys first off a bit of background I have have been rolling since the 80&#039;s when it was legal.&nbsp; I was synthesizing MDMA/MDA during the early to mid 90&#039;s had our own press and everything.&nbsp; All of the stamps didn&#039;t really come around until 95-96 and what cause them to start using them was the fact that people were making bad pills and it became a marketing tool. Prior to the stamps pills looked just like any vitamin you would find in a health food store.&nbsp; It was very easy to get screwed but the community that was using MDMA was a pretty good group and there weren&#039;t a lot of scammers. <br /><br />Pills are press at different pressures, I am sure most of you have seen really soft pills and really hard pills.&nbsp; This is really the only factor that can change your roll and really all it does is change how quickly it hits you.<br /><br />If you take a 150mg of molly and take a 100% pure pill that has 150mg of MDMA in it crush the pill up and parachute both in the same kind of setting with the same type of food in your stomach you will get very similar rolls.<br /><br />both products have pluses and minuses<br />Molly you have to weigh out and cap up which is a slow process and a real hassle.&nbsp; But you don&#039;t have a lot of other stuff in molly its easier to tell if its cut with something.<br /><br />Pills are easier to carry and dose with but you never really know whats in them.&nbsp; In the US these days there are more pills packed with RC&#039;s than there are with MDMA.<br /><br />You hear people talk about things being cut with speed or heroin which is so silly to even say since when something is cut its cut to reduce the cost.&nbsp; Think about the cost of speed and heroin?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; yea most things are cut with other things and RC&#039;s are very common.&nbsp; And these are what cause the speedy or heroin effect.<br /><br />So for people that like that 7-8 roll of one pill they like the other stuff in the pill.&nbsp; MDMA is a 3-4 hour roll thats all unless you add more later.<br /><br />Most people like pills because of the convenience but me personally unless I know a pill is 100% MDMA and nothing else I will stick to the molly and take the time to cap my own rolls.<br /><br />As far as the throwing up issue mentioned above, a good dose of MDMA will make a lot of people throw up.&nbsp; In fact back in the day that was a common thing used to gauge the quality of a pill.&nbsp; If it didn&#039;t make you throw up it was a bunk pill.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used to get these pills that were made in a huge facility just south of the border in Mexico.&nbsp; These pills looked like a generic vitamin C pill, used to use a 1000 count vitamin C bottle to travel with them through the air port.&nbsp; Anyway these pill have the huge dark brown spots in them and the marketing tool that was place on them was &quot;h-bomb&#039;s&quot;.&nbsp; Sure a lot of you have heard of these.&nbsp; These pills had 0 heroin in them, in fact they were 175mg of pure MDMA.&nbsp; All the spots were the bonding agent to hold the pill together.&nbsp; Basically an in active glue, lol.&nbsp; But these pills hit hard and would make about 75% of the people that took them throw up.&nbsp; Which just added to the belief that there was heroin on them.<br /><br />I knew small girls that would split one pill 4 ways and have a good night, way to low for me but I have/had a much bigger tolerance and I am a bigger guy.&nbsp; Anyway that place got busted in 95 made the national news for several days.&nbsp; Said they were producing over a million hits a week!<br /><br />Anyway the point here is MDMA is MDMA weather its powder, crystals or pills
