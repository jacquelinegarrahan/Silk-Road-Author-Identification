				So I ordered this ecstasy from Silk Road, right?<br /><br />I track it with USPS.<br /><br />I nervously wait for it to get to the sorting facility, go out for delivery, et cetera.<br /><br />I pick it up, you know, and it&#039;s real professional-looking, real stealth.<br /><br />I open up the box, though, and it&#039;s got another box inside of it that&#039;s shaped really weird. It&#039;s rectangular on the left, but it&#039;s kind of scrunched-up on the right, and it curls up a little.<br /><br />It&#039;s kinda shaped like Massachusetts.<br /><br />At first, I think it must have gotten fucked up in transit, but it couldn&#039;t have been, since the outer box was fine.<br /><br />Anyway, I get a razor blade and I cut the packing tape, and I open it up.<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I look real hard, I figure maybe it&#039;s taped inside one of the flaps of the box.<br /><br />Still nothing.<br /><br />What the hell.<br /><br />So I start up Tor, I go onto SR, and I write a really angry letter to the vendor.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to finalize, since I don&#039;t know if maybe it&#039;s packed away somewhere else that I didn&#039;t notice, or maybe if it got fucked up, or I have no idea what happened.<br /><br />I&#039;m pissed.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know why he would waste my time sending me this box with nothing in it, all crumpled up to look like an East Coast state.<br /><br />I really let him have it.<br /><br />Anyway, a few minutes later, I see that I have a new message in my inbox.<br /><br />I open it up and this is all it says:<br /><br />&quot;What are you complaining about? You did order twenty grams of empty MA, right?&quot;

				One time I tried to buy drugs off the Internet.<br /><br />They never came.<br /><br />The guy said it was &#039;seized by customs&#039;.<br /><br />Then he admitted he didn&#039;t send it.<br /><br />Then he said he was hacked, and needed me to send payments again.<br /><br />He changed his story about two more times.<br /><br />I could tell it was a steaming Silk Load.

				guy walks into a bar with a caputin monkey on his shoulder and orders a whiskey<br /><br />while bartender is pouring, monkey jumps down onto the bar, runs down and picks up a couple marichino cherries and eats them. Then he eats a couple of peanuts. Then he jumps over to the pool table, picks up the cue ball, eyeballs it and puts it in his mouth and swallows it.<br /><br />bartender: hey, did you see what your monkey just did?<br />Patron: Yeah, he likes to eat anything he can put his hands on - i&#039;ll pay for the cherries and peanuts.<br />bartener: Naw, i&#039;m talking about the fucking cueball - he swallowed it whole!!<br />patron: oh, sorry bout that - i&#039;ll pay for that too<br /><br />and he finishes his drink, pays for everything and leaves<br /><br />2 weeks later he returns with the same monkey on his shoulder &amp; orders a whiskey. <br />while the bartender is pouring, the monkey jumps down onto the bar, runs over to the marichino cherries, picks one up and sticks it up his ass, pulls it back out and eats. Same with the peanuts, puts one up his ass, pulls it out and eats it.<br /><br />Bartender shouts - &quot;hey, did you see what your monkey just did?&quot;<br />Patron responds &quot;Yeah, he likes to eat anything he can put his hands on - i&#039;ll pay for the cherries and peanuts.&quot;<br /><br />bartender: &quot;Naw, i&#039;m talking about him putting them up his ass first and then eating them!!&quot;<br /><br />drum roll..............<br /><br />Patron: &quot;oh, ever since the cueball, he likes to check things for their fit first&quot;<br /><br />
