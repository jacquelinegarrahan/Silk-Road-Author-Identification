				I worked in an inner city major hospital as an ED nurse for 12 years. I have so many stories I don&#039;t even know where to start. The accidents, illnesses...things people couldn&#039;t control should not be talked about. But the others....insanity. For a period of time in Houston there was a trend among certain members of an extreme segment of the gay community to have &quot;mummification parties.&quot; A man comes into the ED in a home-made body cast, head to toe, with openings for his nose, mouth anus and genitals. The idea, I was told was to force ejaculation through the use of a cattle prod, rectally, and to use the other openings as the participants wished, while the &quot;mummy&quot; was helpless to resist. This one group decided to use direct 220 V current from a dryer outlet, placing a metal rod into his rectum, and a clamp on his scrotum. The man had expelled all fluids he had to expel, and had essentially cooked in the body cast. His eyeballs had exploded. I was never sure why he was even brought in by EMS, because he was obviously dead, but I got the initial job of cutting the cast off. The smell of burnt flesh was something that was intense enough to make me retch. Describing the state of the body is probably not even required...just think of a human hot dog, cooked far too long, and left to die in a plaster cast. His abdomen, unable to expand in the cast, had split and cooked feces and viscera had saturated the cast. Once the autopsy was done, it was found he had dozens of broken bones. This was perhaps one of the most horrific deaths I had ever seen. I&#039;m sure someone will say I am bashing gays here...bullshit, I&#039;m bashing human stupidity and the fact that a human life was utterly wasted.
