				Blockchain and pingit every time now. Why anyone in the UK would get it anywhere else amazes me.<br /><br />Once you set the app up it takes minutes to get your coins and send them to SR.

				Bitcoin-otc and localbitcoins.com are definitely the best ways to get your coins and keep anonymity strong in most cases.&nbsp; There&#039;s a new GBP exchange but I have no idea if it&#039;s legit or a scam.&nbsp; It&#039;s at https://bitcoin-central.net/ but has no depth as it is a brand new market, proceed with caution if you go that route.<br /><br />For bitcoin-otc visit the wiki if you&#039;re having issues.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the pertinent information for registering keys, it looks like it&#039;s done via IRC:<br /><br />http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/GPG_authentication<br /><br />

				my advice would be stick to trusted sources, i.e. intersango and mtgox, via SWIFT/SEPA transfers, charges vary from bank to bank but its usually £10/£25...<br /><br />this saves the risk of getting burned by anyone, the charges are extortionate but at least u know u will get ur btcs and theres no need to get ur head around IRC/OTC, not to mention GPG... <br /><br />yes u can be traced buying btcs using this method, but buying/trading in btcs is not illegal folks its what u do next with them, in this case buy prohibited drugs lol
