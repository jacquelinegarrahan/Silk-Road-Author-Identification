				i&#039;ve downloaded every single effect you can get for this and it&#039;s never worked for me. tried everything as well, lying down in the dark completely relaxed with my eyes closed and not one of them worked &gt;:(<br /><br />how do you get yours working? how can it work when you&#039;re out? do you really need to concentrate on it or what?

				it sucks, i havent had a good banana trip in a while. they outlawed bananas in my town because everyone was running around yelling ring ring ring bananaphone.&nbsp; my first serious girlfriend&#039;s dad actually told me he tripped off bananas when I was 15 and I almost believed him. What a prick, but its cool I was banging his daughter :P best ass ever<br /><br />I was hoping youd say just buy listening to some beats I could save a thousand in oxycodone every month.

				You have to focus hard and it took me about 9 months for it to work trying it once a week.<br />It sounds dumb that I tried it so much but eventually it does get you high.<br />DEFINITELY not like the real I thing (there&#039;s not comparison) but you can feel something.

				Is it just me that thinks that iDoser is like the Emporer&#039;s new clothes?<br />I believe that if I concentrated on white noise for nine months it would make me high. <br />Ever heard of the placebo effect? If you really, REALLY want to feel an effect from something then you will.

				My fiance claims Idoser worked for her when she was younger. I SERIOUSLY doubt that.<br />she listened to the peyote one. But, after hearing about her &quot;trip&quot; I wanted to laugh.<br />Obviously a placebo, nothing like real psychedelics.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">yep, you get get high of tap water, just believe that.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Actually you really can, if you drink enough water in a short enough time you can get &quot;water intoxication&quot; but from what I&#039;ve heard it&#039;s not fun.
