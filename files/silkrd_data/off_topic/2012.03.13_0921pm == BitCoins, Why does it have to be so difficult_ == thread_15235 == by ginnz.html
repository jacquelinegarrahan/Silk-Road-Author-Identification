				For the love of Christ! Why does it have to be so friggin difficult, and such a rip-off to aquire bitcoin? I mean, at first, i read up on aquiring them through the traders, (Mt.Gox, Ect...) and you need to be a banker/financial trader to understand any of it.... why isnt there a service where its staright forward?&nbsp; Its rediculous. And a buddy bought some from a seller here, but ended up paying such a ridiculous premium. I think he said they ended up costing him about 6.50 US per Bitcoin. I think there would be a helluva lot more transactions if it were easier to obtain them, and they wern&#039;t so overvalued..... just my 2 cents, or .000029 BTC! ;-)

				The easier it would be to get bitcoins, the easier it would be for LE, or anyone for that matter, to follow a paper trail. Yes, the bitcoin sellers on SR charge a premium, but it is a premium for convenience. I have no qualms spending a little more cash to get BTC, especially when all I have to do is deposit money into the sellers bank account, and decide what I&#039;m going to spend my coins on 45 min later.

				I kind of agree with Bud here...<br />It&#039;s pretty simple I find, I&#039;ve never had any problems. Use get-bitcoin.com and do the bank deposit. It&#039;s a 5% fee, which is the cheapest I&#039;ve ever really seen, and you get it usually within a few hours.<br />Easy.

				Honestly, it was quite comforting with how difficult it was for me to find SR and get bitcoins. That means it about just as hard for the stinking fuckin&#039; coppers to get in on this.<br /><br />I&#039;m sketched with using bank accounts to companies, so far iv just saved my cash until i can buy a big moneypak and sell it on SR.<br /><br />The bigger the MP, the better the rate. Last time i had like 350$ and i got a rate at about 5.5bitcoin per dollar, not the best but eh, i sell plenty of weed at home so as long as i can get those Specialty Items from SR im a happy camper.

				Here&#039;s what I did.<br />I signed up for Dwolla. Waited a few days and verified my account by looking up how much the dwolla deposits were in my account (they deposit two amounts into your account, each under 12 cents). Next I added to my account a few hundred dollars. I waited a few days.<br /><br />Next I signed up for mtgox.com. I followed the instructions/wizard for depositing money into mtgox. I waited a few minutes and then bought bitcoins with my money.<br /><br />Then, I sent bitcoins to my Silk Road account by clicking on bitcoin wallet on the main silk road website and copying the address they told me to send bitcoins to. Then, I selected fundingoptions&gt;withdraw funds from mtgox, typed in the relevent information (such as the address to send the bitcoins to).<br /><br />Finally, I added items from the silk road to my cart, checked out, and then within 1-7 days got drugs that I could never get on my own, with as little risk as possible, delivered on my front porch like I ordered it off of amazon, for relatively cheap (considering the drugs I ordered changed my life and gave me an experience I will never forget).<br /><br />So yeah, three websites, follow a few instructions and be patient the first time you sign up. Remember to keep a few hundred in your silk road wallet at all times, and don&#039;t forget to finalize when your product arrives.
