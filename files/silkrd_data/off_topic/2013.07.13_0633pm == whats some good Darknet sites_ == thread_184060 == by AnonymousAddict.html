Took 3 weeks to arrive and box had no air holes. Opened it up to find a dead piss covered transvestite and a bunch of rotting banana peels. Not cool man. I know products never come out looking like they did in the advertisement but GOD DAMN. Calls to the provided toll-free number were answered by some asshole in India I couldn&#039;t understand who told me it was my fault for not requesting insurance on the shipment and who eventually tricked me into buying 2 more slaves that I didn&#039;t even want. One of those packages arrived empty with a large whole in the side of the shit-stained box. The other was one again dead on arrival. With service this shoddy you ought to throw in a free shovel.<br /><br />Customer would NOT recommend this service to a friend.&quot;
