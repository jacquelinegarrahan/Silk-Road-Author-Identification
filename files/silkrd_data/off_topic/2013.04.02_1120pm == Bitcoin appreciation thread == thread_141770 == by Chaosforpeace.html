				In reality it should be appreciation for the road. I had several large orders that have been processing for the last 10-11 days. I finally canceled the orders. The money that I had in those orders is now worth insanely more.<br /><br />If it wasn&#039;t for the road I would have never found bitcoin which has just paid all my bills for the year.<br /><br />Who else loves the bitcoin.<br />Tell your stories of how the bitcoin has just increased your ability to buy the drugs you love, or increased your ability to live.<br />

				Bitcoin just bought me a 50&quot; LCD and the hardware to hang it on the wall ;D<br />I&#039;m not scared of a collapse, I think this will last but you can never be sure so I always like to grab me a little something off gains during spikes like this. Besides, it&#039;s not good if everybody hoards. You gotta put some back in ;)

You will always have 1 day ship times.
