				OK, lets set something says it went on the 5th, for example. Are time stamps off purposely? So , really, it would have been sent on the 4th? <br /><br /><br />Just wondering, for as long as I have been on the Road, this seems to have been the case. Sorry if this is in the wrong section.

				At the risk of sounding like a condescending douchebag, were you unaware that the current time is not the same at all places?

I was just going by dates. Say it says it was placed on one day, then went into transit on another. Basically, are the dates set 1 day ahead of actual dates? Make sense?

				NO. You set your time and date in accordance with where you live. That means the dates are the exact dates, not forward or backwards, the exact date reflective of where you live in the world.

Again, dates are JUST examples. Again, not the forums, the Road.&nbsp; :D

				It was sent on the 8th in the GMT time zone. That could be the 7th or 9th for you, depending on where you live.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say you live in Australia (UTC+10) and the vendor lives in California (UTC-8). The vendor marks a package as in transit at noon local time, February 8. That&#039;s 6 am, February 9 for you, so the vendor sent the package on Feb 8 his time but Feb 9 your time.

				Sorry ErgoProxy.&nbsp; :-[ On the road, the dates are set to the GMT. They are 1 day behind the dates where I live. It depends on where you live with regards to the date matching the one used by SR.
