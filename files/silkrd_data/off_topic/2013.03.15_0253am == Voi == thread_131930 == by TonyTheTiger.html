				i think the only physical harm is from the combustion during smoking. it would be healthier (and more economical) to vape or eat it. there are plenty of studies featured in the emperor wears no clothes by jack herer. he&#039;s got a chapter on legit studies and one called &#039;debunking gutter science&#039; where he says how results from certain studies are biased bullshit basically. good read for the more switched on stoner. there&#039;s stuff all over the net though tbf it&#039;s just finding a somewhat trustworthy source amongst all the propaganda that&#039;s hard work.

				wikipedia! and you call yourself the scientist! haha jk but really without knowing the ins and outs of the studies (and who funded them) it&#039;s hard to take any statements like that as factual. like the famous study where they deprived monkeys of oxygen and pumped them full of carbon monoxide. sure the study claimed MARIJUANA CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE rather than carbon monoxide poisoning and asphyxiation cause brain damage/death.

				There is also a study that proves that the marijuana renew the cells in your body preventing cancer ...!<br /><br />And since i stop using tobacco in my joints i don&#039;t have any problem with my lungs, in fact, i can run 1 hour non stop,<br /><br />And i smoke marijuana everyday since 17 years now, never felt ill with it even with 20 joints/bong a day.<br /><br />I have a life, a job a family, some friends and my beautiful girlfriend.<br /><br />Cannabis is the less risky drug on the world (less dangerous than caffeine or sugar) for your body and for your brain (if no schyzophrenia for sure)<br /><br />Propaganda is bullshitting on cannabis, because the governments don&#039;t like the drugs that keep open your eyes and consciousness, bob marley was right!

				I don&#039;t know how all you guys are saying that you have been smoking for 5-10+ years and are having no ill effects from it.&nbsp; I am a long time smoker and I definitely feel the effects of it on my lungs/airways.&nbsp; Many times I will have to clear my throat and spit repeatedly just to get the feeling of phlegm out of the back of my throat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am currently trying to ween myself off of smoking and just vaporize, but I am had to quit smoking for a week or so to get my tolerance low enough where vaporizing will get me to the same place that smoking would.&nbsp; Every heavy smoker could use a Tolerance break every once in a while.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here is an article at the New York Times:<br />http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/marijuana-smoking-does-not-harm-lungs-study-finds/<br /><br />&quot;In the near term, smoking marijuana irritates the airways and can cause coughing, and public health advocates stress that it causes impairment that reduces attention, lowers motivation and heightens the risk of accidents. Over days or weeks, chronic use can lead to problems with learning and memory. But whether smoking marijuana sets off the type of pulmonary changes that lead to lasting damage like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a leading cause of death among Americans, was not entirely clear.&quot;<br /><br />and then there is this:<br />&quot;Dr. Kertesz noted that with heavier marijuana use, described as 10 joint-years of exposure or more, lung function did begin to decline. And for a person who smokes both marijuana and cigarettes, “the net effect is going to be continued loss of lung function.”<br />&nbsp;<br />I think the jury is still out on just how harmful smoking MJ is to your body and I don&#039;t think we will get a definitive answer anytime soon because it is illegal and studies on it are severely limited.

				nope i&#039;m saying that the comparatively mild harm from consuming cannabis is a direct result of the combustion/smoking which can be avoided with a vape. tony&#039;s saying he feels ok but still asking out of concern for his health. <br />&quot;cannabis smoke does not cause any changes in the small airways, the area where tobacco smoke causes long term and permanent damage.&quot;

				I guess I should have worded my response better.&nbsp; I was mainly replying to &quot;mastic&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you smoke MJ chronically for 10 years straight and feel no ill effects than you are Superman.&nbsp; Your lungs are not meant to inhale ANY kind of smoke.&nbsp; Vaporizing or eating is definitely the way to go.

				i can&#039;t stand bongs, i&#039;m a thickshit european rolling spliffs with tobacco. can you tell how much i care about cancer? i personally use it for a combo of depression, arthritis and back pain. it works great for that, better than anything else i&#039;ve tried. maybe it causes cancer. so does a lot of stuff. depression makes me want to die. cannabis makes me happy enough to be alive. that&#039;s good enough for me.
