				I can&#039;t afford to buy on SR often, and I hate the bitcoin process... so when I do, I try to plan it out carefully.<br /><br />Yesterday I chose what I wanted to buy, and today bought the bitcoins, but misread the fee or something. It was around 280 usd and I ended up less than a dollar short of what I need.&nbsp; :o<br />If any kind soul would donate ~0.1btc to my cause, I would be be very grateful.

				currently same as my forum name.<br /><br />And with the bitcoin changing in value over the last hour, it might soon go over 0.1...<br />bitcoins are weird, maybe tomorrow if it goes up again, I&#039;ll be able to afford it...<br /><br />edit: yep... 0.11 now. I hate bitcoins.

				Ended up just going through the hassle and ridiculous fees of adding more money to my account.<br /><br />The feeling of spending hours getting money transferred to bitcoins and then being off by a few cents is miserable and I feel for anybody in this same situation.<br />The product I was going to buy disappeared since then and now I have to wait for something similar.<br />I mean... the original 30 cents (before transfer rate changes) on a ~$200 order is just stupid. If I had gotten help, I probably would have repaid that and more next time I needed to add money.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ll have a bit extra after I buy, so if a similar post catches my eye with somebody else a few cents short, I&#039;ll try to help &#039;em out.<br />What goes around comes around.

				Well thats kinda the point in the service im developing, it specializes in micro-loans, for purchases, but unless i setup a donation page it will probably only be for long term silk road, and silk road forum members, that have a reason to pay back the loan. if i setup a donation system, there will be possibilities to lending to not so regular uses, even though they are a high risk of non repayment.

				Not a bad idea. If you start a thread or something about this, let me know.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t mind lending/gifting some money... you know... if it&#039;s a stupidly small amount.<br />Yes, I&#039;m still mad at myself for that.&nbsp; ;D Nobody should have to feel that pain.
