				I have been smoking cannabis&nbsp; for a long time now, but I can honestly say that I have never smoked with anyone who commented on a weeds &quot;expansion&quot;. <br /><br />However when I look at online reviews of strains, &quot;good expansion&quot; is something that&#039;s often mentioned.<br /><br />So what is expansion?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />

I might be using the wrong example but, think of it as heavy and light smoke. <br /><br />A dank cheese variety might be a heavy smoke, when you take a normal hit, about a second later it feels as if you took a hit 3x as big, almost like it exands in your lungs.<br /><br />I generally find the danker, indica varietis to be the lung expanders whereas sativa&#039;s seem to be much ligher. Most likely has to do with resin content being slighty higher in many indica varieties.

				I always assumed that when they were talking about expansion they were referring to how the compressed weed re-expanded after shipment lol
