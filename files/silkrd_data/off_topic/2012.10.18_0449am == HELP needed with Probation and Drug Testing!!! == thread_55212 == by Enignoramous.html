				Hi guys. I need to ask a question about drug testing because im on probation.<br />So I was arrested for drinking and driving in June and was put on probation. Last month I was talking with my probation officer and she was asking me about any drug use. I admitted to useing pot because she said that she would be doing urine tests throughout my probation so I couldn&#039;t lie. So I said that I do use pot but occasionally. I didn&#039;t tell her that I had smoked the night before but I did tell her that I used within the last week or so. (was that a big mistake??)<br /><br />fast forward to recently. We met again and I had to do a urine test again to make sure I was clean (since my first test was positive for pot obviously) or else she said I would be violating my probation terms and would have to go to the judge again. I haven&#039;t smoked anything since the night before the first urine test. and I&#039;m meeting with her in a couple more weeks. Will there still be thc in my system even though its been a month? I&#039;m not a heavy smoker - like 1-2 bowls a week or so, maybe less. I really am worried that there will still be thc even though I havent done anything in a month.<br /><br />does the urine test measure like a yes or no, or is it like a percentage or does it tell you if the person has smoked within the last 24 hours or like 10 days or 30 days? <br /><br />thanks guys. i appreciate any help

Did they use a standard 5-Panel test they do in the office or did the office send it out to a lab? If you have THC in your system at the time of taking the test, it&#039;s going to obviously come out positive and it doesn&#039;t matter how much is in your system because a positive is a positive.<br /><br />You said you haven&#039;t smoked in a month right? You should be completely fine if it really has been a month...Google is your friend and you can research the amount of time THC is likely to stay in your system (usually 30 days or less depending on your body because everyone&#039;s body is different) and the cutoff levels for the drug test they are using. Just RELAX!&nbsp; :) You&#039;ll be fine if it&#039;s been a month.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on both Probation and Parole and in both cases they would switch off between using a standard 5-Panel (and in my case they would use a 12-Panel) and sending it out to the lab depending on the person who was giving me the test.<br /><br />My advice? Don&#039;t smoke while on probation...I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re situation is but I had 5 years of my prison sentence suspended and I damn sure didn&#039;t want to go back so I stayed away from ALL drugs.

				Been through plenty of testing in my life. Without a doubt, you&#039;re fine. You&#039;d be fine if you smoked 10 days ago, let alone thirty. Key is drink a lot, and get plenty of exercise so you can clean that shit out of you. For the walgreens ones it only takes a few days for me to get &quot;clean&quot; and the more sophisticated ones take just a little longer than that so fuck it.<br /><br />Also, just saying, if you haven&#039;t smoked since that day, how would it even make sense to bust you if you truly hadn&#039;t smoked since then and they knew the thc would carry over to the next month? Even in that hypothetical situation, you would be able to work something out with your PO, unless he was a cynical fuck. <br /><br />Just don&#039;t sweat it. You really wanna go overboard, drink a shitton of water until the test day if it&#039;ll put your mind at ease.
