				Hi there. Just wondering how one would go about making these and how much MDMA do you put in a cap and do you mix it with anything else to make it easy on the stomach and liver?<br /><br />I&#039;m just thinking you put 100mg MDMA 80%+ fine crushed up powder (how fine?) into those gel caps and just swallow for the same desired effect a pressed pill would give you. Any tips would be much appreciated thanks!

				Well you described the best way to do it your self. I personally would have put 125mg in a capsule, but 100 will be ok too :) I think there is not much else you can put in the capsule to make it easier on the stomach and liver.

				For me 150mg is the right dose, 100mg isn&#039;t enough to get you rolling..

				I sat here yesterday filling caps with around 100mg. Took ages and I spilled a bit which i then ate. Was feeling pretty happy afterwards but think there has to be an easier way...........

Would a straw be too big for 00 sized caps? or would just rolling up a piece of plastic and making it like that be better?<br /><br />I used post-it notes to do it but was very slow with a bit of spillage.

				My method is using a cigarette rolling paper, I tare it on my scale.<br /><br />I add 100mg (Obviously you can add any dosage you like) onto the cigarette paper then poor it into my caps with my custom made funnel.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />It&#039;s quite easy to build a paper funnel and it works very well.<br /><br />Cut out a circle (experiment with sizes, a swisse mens ultivite container is the perfect size for me), cut out a quarter from the circle and tape the remainder together and snip off the end with scissors. It also helps to have a stoker, I use a blow gun dart. You can also reinforce your funnel with tape, but they&#039;re so quick and easy to make it&#039;s not really necessary.<br /><br />This method is quite tedious and does take time, patience and a steady hand. But it works for me and if the caps are going for $30 each it&#039;s time well spent.<br /><br />I can fill about 30 per hour.<br /><br />There are also other methods which involve determining the capacity of your capsule then mixing your molly accordingly with a filler... sugar for example and filling the capsule to capacity, it works well if you have a capsule machine, although depending on how well you mix your M and F you may have inconsistency it&#039;s also not great if you intend to break open the capsule and snort.<br /><br />Also, a fine powder isn&#039;t necessary people really love seeing those sexy looking moon rocks.

				DAMN! you&#039;re selling em for $30?!? Where can i get clientele like that? jk, please don&#039;t say, gotta protect your security and whatnot. BTW, how much are you putting in each cap?<br /><br />But really, unless you want it down to the mg there&#039;s no sense in weighing out every Molly cap like that.&nbsp; For other powders like the 2c series or 4FA i will because the 2c its just good to be exact on and my 4FA is pretty clumpy and i often cant tell the difference between 20 and 50mg in a size 3 cap. <br /><br />But check it out:&nbsp; Toss a half dozen(or more) caps on a scale and get an avg mg per cap.&nbsp; they should only be off by 2-5mg anyways with halfway decent caps.&nbsp; size 3 is by far the easiest, btw.&nbsp; Separate them, hold the large end between your thumb and forefinger and &#039;scoop&#039; at the molly.&nbsp; it should clog up the front portion of the cap, tip up and tap to settle the powder.&nbsp; repeat.&nbsp; Now weigh the cap.&nbsp; by subtracting the difference you can find how much MDMA is in the cap.&nbsp; <br /><br />It does take some getting used to and you will need to weight every(other) cap for a while till you get the hang of it but before too long you will only need to check every 10th cap or so and you will AT LEAST triple your production speed.<br /><br />few things to keep in mind: you WILL get MDMA on your fingers, not a ton, but you will def catch a buz(especially if you lick it off afterwards).&nbsp; this is also good to keep in mind because if you cap enough of it this way it IS POSSIBLE(i dunno how likely) to piss dirty afterwards.&nbsp; I can&#039;t verify that myself but 2 people i trust say they&#039;ve pissed dirty after handling and bagging drugs while remaining abstinent(1 for molly, 1 for coke/crack).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also it&#039;s much easier to do this if it&#039;s crushed to powder as the consistency is the same.&nbsp; it&#039;s easier to do this in a baking pan or on something with a ledge that you place foil on so that there is a nice lip for the molly to stay contained in.&nbsp; otherwise you&#039;ll have it spread all over the surface you&#039;re working with and it&#039;ll be a HUGE pain.. in fact, i&#039;d probably recommend putting foil even in&nbsp; the baking pan.<br /><br />Best of luck!

				When I cap MDMA for a show or festival<br />How I do it is I just put a few grams of well powdered up molly in a plastic tray on my scale and simply use gel caps (size 0) to scoop up the molly and subtract each point from the total. Which I&#039;ve found to be a lot easier than trying to fuck with weighing each point up.<br /><br />I hope that helps ya,<br /><br />Rocker
