				Hi,<br /><br />Just joined/discovered SR recently. Used to be a strung out junkie and then walked away from it all 11 years ago. Never regretted it but always had the itch. Rebuilt my entire life, put a business on the road. I own my own home, have 2 nice cars sitting in the driveway and all my bills are paid up to date. So I discover SR and buy some H. I thought that if you only used it for a day or two&nbsp; it wouldn&#039;t be so bad. I was wrong. Bad call. I&#039;ve been as sick as a pig for the last few days. Same as 11 years ago. Then I go into Barclays to deposit money into my Mt Gox account, and they tell me that they can&#039;t do deposits to that account any more. I&#039;m glad in a way cuz I was on a dangerous path. I&#039;m sick as fuck but I&#039;m okay. That stuff is poison.<br /><br />SD

				Thanks everyone. I&#039;m still really sick but I will get through this. I thought I could dabble with this stuff again but boy was I wrong about that. I didn&#039;t use much, got a gram and smoked it. Now I&#039;m as sick as I was 11 years ago when I quit. That H is pure bad news. I made a mistake, I&#039;m paying the price. My fault, pure and simple. I have no desire to destroy my life all over again on account of any drug. Its Sunday morning here, my partner has gone to work. I just fed my 2 cats and walked my dog in the rain. I&#039;m feeling really ill but that will pass. Just cooked a pizza in the oven but no appetite. Have some weed which helps right now. Always smoked and it never caused a problem. That H is a different story altogether. I will be careful and I will stay away from the H. I have never known of anything good to come out of using that drug, only death and misery. I saw so many young people die when I was strung out years ago. I&#039;m lucky I lived to tell the tale. I&#039;m going to take it easy for the day. My pets are all fed and watered so they&#039;re good. My home is warm, clean and comfortable so I&#039;m very lucky really. I used to be a junkie and managed to quit. 11 years is a long time. This recent experience has scared the shit out of me. Any illusions I had about using H recreationally&nbsp; are well and truly gone. I&#039;m just going to spend the day licking my wounds and will try to eat something. Its raining outside, my white cat (Jill) is here sitting on the desk. My black cat (Jack) is asleep in the livingroom, and my dog is asleep in the bedroom. The news channel is on the TV, background noise. It could be a lot worse. The last few days have been hell on earth but what did I expect ? I well and truly deserve the &quot;dumb fucker of the year&quot; award.

				Many thanks to all of you for your comments and wishes. I mean that sincerely. I&#039;m still sick but on the mend. Opiate withdrawal is indescribably horrible. I slept for a bit which was good, my loyal dog curled up beside me. Its stopped raining so shes out in the front garden right now and Jack the cat is being all lovey. I rescued him when he was a kitten and almost dead. My pets are an inspiration to me all the time. I&#039;m stickin&#039; with the weed from here on in. Jesus, that smack nearly killed me. Wow. The sun is shining through out there and I&#039;m strong enough to take the hit for this. If that stuff got me in its clutches again I&#039;d be gone. I feel so sad for those whose souls are being destroyed by this stuff. I&#039;m no prude and as crazy as a shithouse rat sometimes, but I wouldn&#039;t wish H on my worst enemy. It dehumanised me for many years when I was strung out. I was not human any more. All I cared about was the next fix and not getting sick. I hurt so many people. Today, my pets all love me, my partner does too. Thats some change. I like who I am today and H will not steal it away from me. Maybe thats what went wrong in the first place. I&#039;m going to have some food and just be gentle for today. My dog has just had her dinner and treats so everyones happy around here. I wish you all the very best and I am grateful to you all.
