Then I remember that they don&#039;t have a monopoly on the market so can&#039;t tax it forever with the SR model unless they still bust everyone else who attempts to sell drugs that are untaxed. And then I remember that they dont need to tax drugs because they are already making a fortune via taxing people in the name of fighting the war on drugs and selling us all to the prison industrial slave traders (myself not being a statist and thinking the government wants drugs to be illegal to keep us slaves for their own massive financial and political and other power). IMO it is more likely to be run by the C.I.A. to covertly fund some operation that they don&#039;t want the rest of the government to know about, they do need to get funding for their black operations somehow after all. I think the C.I.A. would make a more secure site than SR has though. So most likely it is run by some dude with a bit of technical know how who used to be a small time drug dealer, probably with some business and marketing schooling or experience, who saw the potential of bitcoin and wanted to further the agorist agenda and put some extra cash in his pockets.

				Also I still have not fully ruled out the possibility that SR is run by a federal agency for the purposes of intelligence gathering, however I am leaning against this idea because of the technologies used and the techniques suggested. As long as SR allows Tor and GPG and Bitcoin I think it is trust worthy, although to be fair almost all of the users here are using bitcoin incorrectly and can probably be deanonymized by financial network analysis. DEA might have realized that more people would use bitcoin incorrectly than correctly. However security is in the hands of the user no matter what. It is also possible the FBI or another agency found a zero day exploit in Tor or some other program and decided to launch a massive intelligence gathering operation against the drug using and dealing community (ability to identify 100k drug users and dealers around the world would be a world record setting law enforcement intelligence operation...people would be put in the law enforcement hall of fame). I know of one Tor zero day vulnerability and there is some research team that is claiming to have another although I think they have made extremely overstated claims in the past and are not being taken very seriously as they have not yet disclosed it in technical detail.<br />I don&#039;t think LE are smart enough to do these things though, although users on SR really need to start anonymizing their bitcoins and not by using SR&#039;s mix either.

If you are not using a *real* mixing solution (preferably with blind signatures) or obtaining the bitcoins anonymously (paying with cash in the mail, for example) then you are not anonymous. Bitcoins are as anonymous as the method used to pay for them unless you take steps to further anonymize them.

The only people who disagree with this are fucking retards who thinks the government spends its own money to fight the war on drugs, rather than stealing money from the people to fund itself. The war on drugs is a means to an end, increased funding for government agencies and increased power for police forces. Of course it has some other goals though, like keeping religious whack jobs happy and pouring money into corporations who in turn support politicians who support the war on drugs. The war on drugs is a modern form of slavery where the freedom of some minority / subset of the population is sold to corporations for profit. The war on drugs is a campaign to round up slaves for elite private interests, the war on drugs is funded by money stole from other slaves.
