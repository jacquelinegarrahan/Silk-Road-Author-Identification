Nothing better to wind down to...<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t really watch anything while fully tripping, but as it fades away watching the planet earth series = mindblowing.

				Psybient (psychedelic ambient), especially Solar Fields (made the in-game music for Mirror&#039;s Edge), especially his album Blue Moon Station. Carbon Based Lifeforms is a great artist too.

				Marcy Playground - Opium - www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGvQ6LtkPwc<br /><br />This is my go to song when tripping, as well as the rest of this same album. I&#039;m not really into trance, dubstep etc unless I&#039;m rolling.<br /><br /><br />Nirvana - Heart Shaped Box - www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6P0SitRwy8<br /><br />This video is great when tripping, I&#039;ve introduced several people to tripping and I had them each watch this video on the come up and then showed it to them again in the middle of the trip just to show them the huge difference, the subtle details you notice when tripping is pretty fascinating.

				I&#039;d go for fighting/martial arts films. My personal favourite is Undisputed 3, watch the second one first though. The first one is a different storyline and wasn&#039;t as good as the second and third one.<br /><br />Music - EMINEM... My personal favourite Eminem track is &#039;Beautiful&#039;

				@Meister: You should definitely check out A Scanner Darkly or A Waking Life. The dude rotoscoped the shit out of those movies and they have the most esoteric plot lines. which means they work great for a tripper attention span. I have friend that refuse to watch a waking life UNLESS they are tripping, because they don&#039;t want to ruin the magic of it.<br /><br />The Wall is also good for these purposes but way overdone.

				Also. if you like alice in wonderland and 2001: a space odessy . You should check out the pink floyd syncs for them. (like dark side of the rainbow)<br /><br /><br />I also forgot to mention anything that the ORIGINAL star wars movies and star trek episodes are always good when high. plus all the different original planet of the apes stuff. and if your really high, the bill and ted flicks (But you gotta be super-mega-mondo stoned to watch those two movies)

				I&#039;d say that David Lynch is the king of mind fucks.&nbsp; Particularly, his films Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive.&nbsp; Total mind fucks.&nbsp; His films are meant to be visually, auditorily and mentally consumed in altered states of consciousness; but requires total immersion into the film with a nice sound system.&nbsp; Total genius at creating sequences that trip out the viewer.

				Watched Steven Spielberg&#039;s A.I on MXE last night, it was surreal as fuck. <br /><br />What does it mean to exist? Does the robot have a soul, it certainly has feelings. Maybe its real? If it thinks its real, what am I? Am I real? Am I a dream of robot? How do I know I really exist?<br /><br />My mind was full of fuck, the movie and different realities collided. <br /><br />
