				For some reason I feel like my experience in the dream is similar to what meth would really feel like. I remember it was an intense rush, but it peaked really quickly and the peak was quite/really short and I remember thinking it was the most euphoric drug I&#039;d tried but at the same time it was very disappointing that the peak ended so abruptly. It was a little bit like MDMA in that I had alot of confidence and overall it just kind of made me feel &#039;enhanced&#039; or &#039;superior&#039; kind of more intelligent than &#039;normal&#039; people and had alot of energy and very bouncy. Is this kinda like the effects of meth?

				Never done meth but have had several dreams about it. It was an absolute nightmare. I dreamed about taking a few hits and grinding my jaw till all my teeth fell out and blood dripped out my gums. In another one two of my molars just fell out and I took each one in my hand and ground them against each other while I ran down the streets.&nbsp; :&#039;(

				I wouldn&#039;t call it euphoric. The closest it got to that would be... imagine if you were euphoric for so long it stopped being interesting or fun. Still felt good, but not euphoria like I know and love from MDMA and LSD.<br /><br />I also never entered a hazy state. I was incredibly focused, had tremendous control to be single-minded when working on something (usually drawing), and I felt extremely confident in myself and my abilities. My working memory was noticeably enhanced.<br /><br />I was smoking probably 4-8 times a day for a while, I didn&#039;t have any issues with short peaks but of course I was reupping almost constantly.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t suggest most people try it. I wouldn&#039;t suggest it for most things. But if you have 3 days to finish something that&#039;ll take 64-72 work hours to finish, meth will get it done.<br /><br />Anyone who says it shouldn&#039;t be taken that far, I say you&#039;re too relaxed with it. 3 days on it sounds like a lot, but it also means no excuse to use it unless you need to be up that long. If you&#039;re not intending to defy sleep with no effort, -take something else-. Seriously, if you just want the pleasantness take a low dose of MDMA so it&#039;s more calm, or take a high dose and just enjoy it more.<br /><br />In my opinion, meth is a tool to be used on such rare occasions most people would never need to touch it.
