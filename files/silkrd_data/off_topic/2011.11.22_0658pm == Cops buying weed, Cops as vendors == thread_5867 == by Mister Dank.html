				I think that a lot of vendors on this site ARE cops. Here&#039;s why:<br /><br />I know I&#039;ve been repeatedly stung by fake buyers. First one buys from me, a guy like williamgates, to find out what P.O. I&#039;m sending out of. Once they have that nugget of info, an LE buyer under another name, like Diss0lve, will ask for large quantities and make an order, notifying the post office to look for his address. Then the package for no good reason just disappears with no tracking info when on usps.com. <br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve sent out plenty of packages that DO make it and the tracking is on the site and everything. There is literally NO WAY for a group of my packages to be intercepted UNLESS the Post Office has prior knowledge from the buyer. The cops have a huge incentive to sell on here - they can bust and make money at the same time. Also, when packages do disappear on me, they&#039;re usually to places that LOOK like cop neighborhoods (upper middle class, like Agrestic in Weeds). <br /><br />So right now I&#039;m only doing small amounts, so I can do full refunds for anyone who&#039;s package disappears, and then never do business with them - or anyone else who&#039;s been refunded. I&#039;m still getting the LE troll constantly re-editing my feedback to play games, but at least he&#039;s outing himself. And hopefully, SR will do the right thing and delete williamgates account and also end the craziness of never-ending feedback edits.<br /><br />So who are the cops selling on SR?? The ones who aren&#039;t having these problems. The &quot;everything is just rosy&quot; mother fuckers on here who claim to NEVER lose packages or have trolls. The ones who admonish other sellers for ever getting bad feedback. <br /><br />With all the competition on here, there are always going to be people trying to hit and run others feedback - it&#039;s a mathematical certainty that someone is going to try to. So when someone says they&#039;re having no issues, you&#039;d be crazy to not be suspicious.

				I think that you can take it as a given that LE is here. There is too much shit here that really pisses them off (think heroin and meth). I think sellers need to operate with the assumption that any order they send out may be going to an evidence locker somewhere.<br /><br />The other thing I think is that when they move, they&#039;ll move in force, without warning, and bring down everyone they have gathered evidence on and tracked over time. Think pre-dawn raid, except via the internet. <br /><br />And when you say &quot;Cops buying weed, cops as vendors&quot; don&#039;t be naive -&nbsp; I think that should read &quot;DEA Special Agents working in a task force with FBI Cybercrime experts and a Dept Homeland Security special taskforce coordinated by an ICE central command&quot;. <br /><br />Don&#039;t kid yourself, once they triangulate you and gather enough info to attack, it will be sudden and brutal. <br /><br />So don&#039;t give them enough info to do that.<br /><br />Just my 2cents, whatever it&#039;s worth.

				Operating on the assumption that LE is here is one thing...but I think we need to be really careful, and show some restraint when pointing the finger at specific people.&nbsp; Often people are just new or inexperienced, or simply playing by the rules, and just like on the streets, I would never want to put that kind of &#039;jacket&#039; on an innocent.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most places I&#039;ve been, it&#039;s the very worst kind of gossip, and always to be avoided.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been ripped off by a seller on here, and I would never call him out as LE, as it isn&#039;t right, and accomplishes nothing.&nbsp; Also, it can be a form of crying &#039;wolf&#039; and we want to make sure we have credibility, just in case the wretched day ever comes, where we actually are confronted with LE.&nbsp; And want to warn our fellows.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m often concerned that LE would establish a fake vendor&#039;s account, just to harvest and bust a bunch of buyers, but unless I am certain that this had occurred, I would not accuse.<br /><br />Got to have a bit of street ethics, until we get all this sorted out.&nbsp; OF course I protect myself, but I also presume good will on the other end, unless proven different.&nbsp; I never want to let paranoia or bitterness over bad transactions, make me point the finger falsely at another.

				Hey phubaiblues - totally agree. re-reading my post above I guess I sound a bit like a prophet of doom and really cynical and paranoid ... I&#039;m not. I have logged some miles on the silk road at this point, and have had a great travel experiences and met some like minded, good hearted people.<br /><br />I guess after some reflection, I just really want this trade route to stay open. I know there are people reading this message right now who would love to lock me in a cage and throw away the key, and I just want to remind my fellow travelers and trading partners ... stay vigilant; you&#039;re smart and you&#039;re innovating our culture, don&#039;t let small minded people crucify you for simply implementing the inevitable.<br /><br />This is the silk road. This is an evolution of an idea that began when a small fishing village in China saw a trading vessel from a distant land on the horizon 3000 years ago, and welcomed them to shore.<br /><br />Good luck and godspeed.

				Fear is when you know imminent danger is upon you. Paranoia is an ongoing perception of and imaginary Fear. At some point, if not already, SR is going to become very main street. Some Senator will want to be the hero that brought down SR, some 15 year old guy will figure out how to become a Billionaire off SR &amp; Bitcoins...so at some point SR will have to be 2.5 steps ahead to keep this ship going. Napster was totally illegal, yet Wallstreet poured millions in. If it&#039;s about enough Money, be it taxes or something offshore..you can beat these fuckers.

Someone who&#039;s actually on here breaking the law has a healthy paranoia and WANTS to identify cops. Everyone, myself included, should be scrutinized. The people I mentioned are not &quot;new&quot; or &quot;inexperienced&quot; - they&#039;re bonafide scammers and I&#039;ve laid out why in another thread.<br /><br />Also, a lot of cops are on here to make money, probably more so than to get a list of buyers. The CIA and US military has been in the heroin trade for decades. <br /><br />I&#039;ve been anti-authoritarian my whole life. Even as a teen, I knew there was something rotten about the powers that be. I could see it in the child-like behavior of anyone who works for tax dollars, from school admins to cops. I&#039;ve lived a long and full life and I KNOW even from an email conversation the difference between someone who grifts for a living and a government parasite as easily as you know an apple from an orange. They&#039;re two very different mind sets. I&#039;m gonna out people like &#039;Diss0lve&#039; every time because I KNOW that a real drug dealer wouldn&#039;t go on this site and ask a guy with a low feedback score to send a qp on their first order. Not to mention he gave me an address for an office building right next door to a post office.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Entrapment hardly exists in the legal world.&nbsp; You would have to prove that LE coerced you into doing something illegal that you wouldn&#039;t have done without the coercion.&nbsp; They can legally put unlocked cars on streets corners in the ghetto with the keys in the ignition and legally bust anyone taking the bait.&nbsp; They can put a hot cop in skimpy clothing on the streets, have her show you her tits and negotiate a blow job.&nbsp; Even if you say &#039;no thanks&#039; and she drops the price to $1.50 and you go for it, you&#039;re busted and that&#039;s still not entrapment. <br /><br />LE is infamous for provoking people into violence and then PROVIDING bomb making equipment that these people had no avenues of getting otherwise, then LE busts them for terrorism.&nbsp; If that&#039;s not entrapment, putting a listing on SR is no where near entrapment.

				Everything is doomed eventually. SR must adapt or perish. No bail outs for the weak here. The tea party should love how we operate. No big government and an unregulated boom-bust economy, with guns, and lots of people they can use to populate the prisons. <br /><br />Without the war on drugs many jobs will be lost. Prison guards, law enforcement at every level, and most of the 3 letter agencies would be cut among others. We are the real job creators. Where&#039;s my tax break?<br /><br />The government selling drugs online could open them to lawsuits. If I order H from a phony vendor and my son accidentally eats it and dies they would be in a world of shit. People dying might be the catalyst that gets SR taken down too. Underage kid orders dope and ODs. Every news station will latch onto the story and politicians who hours ago didn&#039;t know silk road existed will be out with torches and pitchforks demanding SR be shut down.<br />

Typical political posturing, perfectly rehearsed outrage a la &quot;THINK OF THE CHILDREN!&quot; type nonsense spouted off to settle down the soccer moms or whatever the fuck you call middle class stay-at-home moms these days.<br /><br />Yet we grew and no one as far as we know (Silk Road the sysop and creator may know) was arrested. No one was made an example of. And the site got better and more efficient. There were enhancements. There is variety and a vibrant community ... it&#039;s erowid but with an inventory. There&#039;s idiots here of course, cuz there&#039;s idiots everywhere. but there&#039;s very, very smart people here. Creative innovative organic chemists, smoke farmers who have perfected thc, origami artists who can make a fistful of powder disappear into a regular size envelope indistinguishable from a Verizon bill or birthday card from grandma.<br /><br />So, my question to the k-K00l 3l1t3 who work as network administrators, or the sysops who are web application developer experts and datacenter security professionals is ... can they do it? can they stop us? Can LE divert resources from protecting our national data infrastructure from coordinated, sophisticated, well funded tactical attacks from nation states like china, russia, and who the fuck ever and stop us if they really, really, really wanted to?<br /><br />I mean besides DDoS of course. But that&#039;s so boring and doesn&#039;t stop us permanently.<br /><br />Anyone know? I mean really know, not guess based on paranoia and an article you read in Wired last month. Can the NSC get my real IP right now if they&#039;re willing to divert processing resources to do it?

				Fed LE is seeding the site with either bot sellers that just collect addresses, or they are seeding with task force buyers that are just harvesting evidence from postmarks and packaging. bet on it. <br /><br />However, its not all bad as it seems. There is no way, without breaking the Tor encryption and any PGP in the messages you use, that they can close the loop. I feel it is most likely that locals will not be acting as they cant get both end of the buy. The pheds and TLA are just doing enough to say to the Lawmakers (Schummer) &quot;hey look at this, a list of names (fake) and buyers ) (tiny buys, unknown intent and questionable as to evidence if the buyers are smart). <br /><br />I will say it again : Total SR economy is perhaps....30M, and that&#039;s a stretch. Tiny orders, private parties, difficult cross jurisdictional cases work ups. Very tough to justify when you are allocated a 6 billion dollar budget just for Blackhawks to Columbia and Mexico cartel war. <br /><br />OTOH: There are sellers here that could, could, maybe have a bullseye - I am thinking of one emeritus seller we all love who has a tag line to the effect, of &quot;I sell a lot of Oxy&#039;s&quot; Hey Mr. DDro!!!!!! Him we don&#039;t have to lose sleep over.

				I don&#039;t want to enter into politics and I&#039;ll try to stay on topic.<br /><br />LE vendors? I see no reason to catch an ounce user. Now let&#039;s say they become a reputable seller and gather loads of buyer&#039;s addresses. What are they going to do with such addresses? Bust them all at once? Start intercepting all mail from them?<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible or feasible to arrest many SR buyers at once.<br /><br />IMHO opinion the risk is for the seller. They can create dozens of new accounts on SR, start buying from one seller and see from which Post Office they&#039;ve sent the package. I don&#039;t know how it works in US, but do they put an electronic stamp on the package? It is possible for the LE check when the electronic stamp was placed on the letter and look for camera recordings for that specific minute and trace a profile? Later check with ISPs who in that are is connectiong thru TOR.<br />For a small package can a seller simply put it inside some box and later an employee send the package (with a bunch of other mails)?<br /><br />There&#039;s no way to control buyers (could be a seller competitor, a scammer, LE or even a troll).<br />For sellers (IMHO), the best thing to do is to go to as much different post offices as possible and put the package in the box without talking to a clerk (can you do that in US?) and parking in a place with no cameras. And always use crowded post offices.

Here&#039;s why:<br /><br />I know I&#039;ve been repeatedly stung by fake buyers. First one buys from me, a guy like williamgates, to find out what P.O. I&#039;m sending out of. Once they have that nugget of info, an LE buyer under another name, like Diss0lve, will ask for large quantities and make an order, notifying the post office to look for his address. Then the package for no good reason just disappears with no tracking info when on usps.com. <br /><br />Now, I&#039;ve sent out plenty of packages that DO make it and the tracking is on the site and everything. There is literally NO WAY for a group of my packages to be intercepted UNLESS the Post Office has prior knowledge from the buyer. The cops have a huge incentive to sell on here - they can bust and make money at the same time. Also, when packages do disappear on me, they&#039;re usually to places that LOOK like cop neighborhoods (upper middle class, like Agrestic in Weeds). <br /><br />So right now I&#039;m only doing small amounts, so I can do full refunds for anyone who&#039;s package disappears, and then never do business with them - or anyone else who&#039;s been refunded. I&#039;m still getting the LE troll constantly re-editing my feedback to play games, but at least he&#039;s outing himself. And hopefully, SR will do the right thing and delete williamgates account and also end the craziness of never-ending feedback edits.<br /><br />So who are the cops selling on SR?? The ones who aren&#039;t having these problems. The &quot;everything is just rosy&quot; mother fuckers on here who claim to NEVER lose packages or have trolls. The ones who admonish other sellers for ever getting bad feedback. <br /><br />With all the competition on here, there are always going to be people trying to hit and run others feedback - it&#039;s a mathematical certainty that someone is going to try to. So when someone says they&#039;re having no issues, you&#039;d be crazy to not be suspicious.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Right.

				If LE is really posing as vendors they&#039;d be playing an extremely risky game.&nbsp; Imagine if someone overdosed and died on the gear they were selling, weather it be coke, h, oxys or what have you.

ALL top rated vendors on here are LE. They buy from other vendors to discover what P.O.(s) you&#039;re sending from. Then they have another LE buyer buy from you while at the same time alerting the Post Office to the package.<br /><br />example: buyer Pigfuck orders a gram of weed from you, gets it and discovers you shipped from Smallville. LE Buyer Shitbag then tries to order as much as possible from you (more to steal) and lets the Smallville P.O. know to look for his package and take it out of delivery so you never get DCN info. Buyer Shitbag then gets your shit from the Smallville P.O. and writes you that he never got your package. You have no DCN info so you&#039;re screwed and buyer Shitbag ruins your feedback score - essentially putting you out of business.<br /><br />Now, buyer Shitbag becomes vendor SmellslikeRoses and resells your shit on here or elsewhere.<br /><br />The main advantage is that LE can coordinate with the Post Offices - you can&#039;t. If you live in a big city you can fuck this process up by using multiple post offices. Not so easy if you live in a rural area though.<br /><br /><br />Oh, and if you commented on here that cops don&#039;t sell drugs - you&#039;re either as naive as a little girl, or you&#039;re a fuckin pig yourself.

				There is zero incentive for LE to do this unless they are selling precursors and manufacturing equip otherwise why would they give a shit about a few grams.

When it comes to war, the one with the most leverage is the one who is more willing to do whatever it takes. This is why you don&#039;t press a desperate foe. A desperate foe has less to lose, therefore is more willing to do the things that seem reprehensible or immoral. One might argue that the government is the desperate foe here, but I think it is us, the oppressed, who are desperate.<br /><br />I can only speak from the viewpoint of an American, but here in the states, the government has been eroding our human rights at an exponential rate since the passage of the patriot act.&nbsp; We American&#039;s have less to lose everyday. As laws become more far reaching and more invasive to our basic human rights, ie it&#039;s getting harder and harder for people with chronic pain to get the medicine they need, illegal plants that God gave us all etc, we are being pushed ever closer to revolution. When the financial system finally buckles under it&#039;s own weight, the last spot of soft sand for us Americans to bury our heads in will be gone. At this point, we will take our country back or die trying. <br /><br />The government knows this just as well as I do. I seriously doubt that any real effort is being spent on SR to further a war that has not only lost all credibility, in the domain of public opinion, but also diverts attention and funding from the new war, the war against ideals. Not saying that there are no cops on SR, I&#039;m sure there are a few, but I think just being cautious will keep you away from them. Don&#039;t forget that the governments of the world that have been the most successful in oppressing it&#039;s people have been masters of propaganda. It&#039;s easier for them to let you believe they are the almighty hand than it is to actually be the almighty hand.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think OP&#039;s scenario is completely far fetched, but that sounds to me like something a well funded police department would do, not the feds. The police in Cali buy tanks and helicopters, they can pull off something like this with their budget, and that sounds like a cops thinking as well; abuse of position to further themselves at the cost of the very citizens they are meant to protect.<br /><br />If any leo is reading this, you should get a real job and leave the dirty immoral profession you have chosen.

				I totally agree that the postmaster will steal your shit if he knows what it is and he&#039;s any sort of pliable in his morals. But this is a far cry from a concerted effort, on the part of the federal government, to commandeer and resale drugs. It would be akin to Pablo Escobar taking cocaine from street level dealers to resale to those just one rung about street level. The CIA and DEA are no doubt engaged in drug trafficking. I think it would be naive to assume they are not. But, they are involved in a much larger way, busting buyers or vendors on SR would not be to their benefit.

				Well I would be inclined to believe that on a site that sells meth, crack, and heroin, recreational amounts of marijuana would be of the least priority to LE. This is just my opinion, but you never know.

				You clearly are LEO Dank. &quot;Ship puff without vacuum sealing...yeah it&#039;s the way forward to not get caught.&quot; Your advice you tool. I mean it&#039;s not that unvacuumed shipments would be way easier for anyone who could be looking for illegal drugs, like say, the police, customs or any other variation of those agencies to find would it? Oh hold on a second....yeah it would wouldn&#039;t it? <br /><br />I suggest you go and buy yourself 2 slices of thick white bread, some butter and maybe a dollop of tomato sauce and put your BACON self in between that mixture.

				Yes, cops can sell drugs.<br /><br />Yes, federal agents can &quot;walk&quot; guns into Mexico.<br /><br />What I haven&#039;t seen mentioned is securing the chain of evidence.&nbsp; The fact that federal agents walked guns into Mexico only became an issue when those guns were LOST, and then an agent was killed by one of the same guns.<br /><br />When cops sell drugs, those drugs, and the recipient, can be followed, tracked, monitored, whatever you want to call it, in order to obtain MORE EVIDENCE.&nbsp; Otherwise, an arrest is made on the spot, and then the cops turn the screws to get that person to roll, cooperate, and inform.<br /><br />Arbitrarily selling and mailing high potency drugs to random people by LE serves no purpose whatsoever, and at the same time endangers public safety.&nbsp; Once those drugs are mailed, there is no admissible evidence whatsoever unless it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that said drugs were indeed received, and furthermore, actually ordered, by the recipient- and this cannot happen unless the chain of evidence remains intact from the time the drugs are mailed to the time the drugs are received- hence the concept of a &quot;controlled delivery&quot;.<br /><br />Now, using operation &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; as an example, what kind of shit storm would be created if LE purchased, and subsequently resold, a generous amount high quality Afghani #4, which then caused the deaths of a 12 year old kid and two of his friends who happened to pick that particular package out of their neighbors mailbox during a random act of mischief?<br /><br />No secure chain of evidence.&nbsp; No reasonable attempt to ensure public safety.&nbsp; No extra-departmental cooperation.&nbsp; Only the DEATHS of a couple of kids to show for their efforts.&nbsp; Such a scandal would eclipse operation Fast and Furious by several orders of magnitude.<br /><br />Yes, LE can break the law in their attempts to &quot;enforce&quot; the law.&nbsp; But they have to tread very, very carefully in order to be able to actually USE THAT EVIDENCE to secure a conviction in a court of law.

				I feel like there is the possibility that LE are active on SR. However, I doubt that LE is spending time opening weed vendors and setting people up for weed. I also doubt that LE is ordering decent amounts of weed then having it seized.
