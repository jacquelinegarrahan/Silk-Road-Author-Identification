				I recently got some LSD, it was my first experience with the drug. Least to say it was an AMAZING experience! Anyway stupidly i put it in the freezer stored in an envelope and a small opened plastic bag.&nbsp; If&nbsp; it was in there for about 12-15 hours, would the condensation of had a chance to degrade it quickly enough? I&#039;d appreciate some feedback from all you experienced drug users ;).

LSD doesn&#039;t like heat or moisture. Not sure whether the moisture on its own is enough to degrade it after such a short time. Pop it and see....

				Obviously i&#039;m going to do more but i just did some yesterday, that&#039;s why i was hoping somebody on here could help me out. Any ideas people? i can&#039;t find any info on the interwebz, it&#039;s all about using tinfoil in an airtight container to prevent the condensation in the first place.....

				It should be fine as long as you keep it frozen. It&#039;s not like tap water which A is liquid and B has chlorine in it which destroys LSD. Keep it frozen, if it&#039;s frozen the molecules wont be able to move around and degrade as easily.

				Wrap it in plastic, then in foil, and put it in the fridge.&nbsp; Freezing it over a period of time may degrade it, but doesn&#039;t always.&nbsp; Some say the foil contact can taint it, some disagree.&nbsp; But the foil will keep out the light, and the plastic will keep out the moisture.&nbsp; Fridge is cool enough.&nbsp; The butter compartment on the door is as good a place as any.
