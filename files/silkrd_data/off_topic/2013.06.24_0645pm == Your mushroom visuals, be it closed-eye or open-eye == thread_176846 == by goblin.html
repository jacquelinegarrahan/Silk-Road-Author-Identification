				Would be interested in collecting your most fantastic, spectacular, wonderful, weird, numinous or what have you, visual or eidetic images while tripping on psilocybin mushrooms. This may include auditory imagery as well.<br /><br />Any dose, but I would want to exclude any cocktails or mixture of mushies with any other drugs (with the possible exception of MAOI, which a lot of people use to enhance and/or extend their shroom trips).<br /><br />Try not to fall into the trap of &quot;creative writing&quot;, OK?<br /><br />goblin

				Saw thousands of golden crosses flying like airplanes over thousands of dark mushromos.... saw alien and undersea landscapes.... and lots of snakes and insects.... <br /><br />once i had a bad trip at night, and i saw shadow people following me everywhere. (i was hearing voices as well. never had that happen before, on any drug. But it should be noted that I had combined mushrooms with hashish and amphetamine. Not a good combination. :()<br /><br />My most profound &#039;visionary&#039; experience though was with acid.... actually re-lived previous incarnation memories... like i was there and it was happening right in front of me.... but these only come in glimpses...

				invisible people on buproprion was sort of neat (after looking past the paranoia) . they lead me around town and I had to follow a ciggerette cherry just floating in the air, something no one else would have noticed. the precise method of how the cloaking worked was interesting that it extended around bodies and cloathing but not around the cherry of a cigeretter entirely in that it glowed pretty brightly

				I ate an eighth of shrooms and walked around my suburb with my two buds. Streetlights had rainbow halos, friends&#039; faces were reflected koleidoscopically. For a large part of my trip I was quite anxious because when I sat and looked down at the pavement I would see it as an ant would see it, valleys and mountains and rivers- but when I looked up, I still felt like an ant, the clouds racing across the night sky. My favourite moment- at about 3 in the morning, when the rabbits here are at their peak of activity, one particularly friendly fellow hopped along our trail for quite some time. We stopped to get close, and surprisingly, it didn&#039;t run away. I looked into its eyes for quite a while and it felt very intense- everything around this rabbit was morphing and refracting, but the rabbit, specifically its eye, was preserved in perfect, realistic detail. I will never forget that rabbit.

				buproprion gave me visuals in the form of such high paranoid delusions that I interpreted the stuff around me to be stuff it wasn&#039;t. I took half a bottle of 30MGs . I don&#039;t recommend it

				My only shroom trip thus far was too intense for me personally but I was fixated on the droplets of water on my legs/arms while in the shower(showers help me with uneasy trips) for about 25 minutes, it was mind blowing and fascinating...I need to try a smaller dose soon. Didn&#039;t really get super amazing visuals or anything but was awesome none the less.

				I never been able to close my eyes for too long on shrooms, i have however been able to close my eyes and even fall asleep on acid and its was good acid too.<br /><br />I just had normal swirly and trippy patterns that i &#039;saw&#039; while my eyes were closed. I had popped a xanax bar as well so i fell asleep pretty easily and had awesome dreams, which i unfortunately forgot a few minutes after waking up. <br /><br />Open eyed mush trippin is very enjoyable for me as well

				Ate a massive dose of shrooms one time and was laying in bed with my lady when it hit.&nbsp; As I&#039;m looking at her I notice she is starting to look a little funny.&nbsp; I start getting up to get a better look at her and she&#039;s fucking melting into the bed we are laying on, literally becoming part of the bed.&nbsp; Freaked me the fuck out, I had the best and worse trip of my life that night, scary beautiful shit!&nbsp; That was when I was a young cub, I&#039;m still a little tentative about eating that much mushrooms again!

To not taste the shrooms (at least not so&#039;s you gag on&#039;em) you have to dissolve the powder in orange juice. Or put it in melted good quality chocolate, not too hot, then wait for it to solidify.<br /><br />They can keep in the freezer for the longest time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Yummy!

I was in a rush when I ate them so I just tea spooned shovled it all into my mouth while drinking with water, fairly sure if I had of taken them like you recommended I wouldn&#039;t have felt like puking.

				7 Grams of shrooms. <br /><br />The next 8 hours were a total mindfuck.&nbsp; I always see eyes when I trip on shrooms, not sure why.&nbsp; I&#039;d close my eyes and see individual eyes looking at me.&nbsp; They were moving at me.&nbsp; The trees turned into crazy ass fractals to the point that the leaves just looked like a kaleidoscope to me. The CEV&#039;s were primarily faces and eyes.&nbsp;

				I too see eyes- multiple eyes on people, eyes on objects, eyes just floating in a sort of fractal plane. Damn I love hallucinating.<br /><br />edit- interestingly, this is exclusive to shrooms.
