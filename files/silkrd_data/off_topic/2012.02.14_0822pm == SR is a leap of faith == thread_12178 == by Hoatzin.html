The best way to &quot;get over the fear&quot;, as you call it, is to read through the different sections of this forum, make sure you understand how things are done, make sure you research the security and lack of anonymity when using BTC and so on. You can read through a number of posts on this forum where users say that it&#039;s ok, and that everything will work, and that the chance of you actually being arrested is slim to none. At the end of the day, you are the one who has to decide whether or not you are comfortable taking that risk.

Sadly, not everyone understands that they should reply with an encrypted message if they receive an encrypted message. It is not up to the person receiving the encrypted message to decide of the reply is &quot;sensitive&quot; enough to encrypt or not encrypt. If you receive an encrypted message, you encrypt your reply as well.

				Keep an attorney on retainer, put a strong emphasis on anonymity, and go from there.<br /><br />Odds are, you&#039;ll be fine. <br /><br />It&#039;s hard to prove possession if you don&#039;t accept the delivery. Read as much as you can on controlled delivery.

Same as me. Besides, even if you happen to order from a vendor who happens to be running a honeypot, it takes a whole chain of mistakes on your part for this to actually turn into a conviction. You&#039;re innocent until proven guilty, and they can&#039;t prove who placed an order based only on the shipping address. Unwittingly having your house used as a drop point isn&#039;t a felony, and that&#039;s exactly what keeps happening to all of us. ;)
