They allow for rapid, anonymous peer-to-peer transactions at low or no cost, without the need for a bank or middleman.<br /><br />Like cash, Bitcoin transactions are not reversible. They are traded worldwide and can be purchased through online exchanges.<br /><br />Sources: Bitcoin Foundation, Bitstamp<br /><br />The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration recently posted a forfeiture notice indicating that agents had seized 11.02 Bitcoins worth $814 from 31-year-old Eric Daniel Hughes for allegedly violating the federal Controlled Substances Act. No other details were provided..........<br /><br />The seizure appears to mark the first time the federal government has gone after Bitcoins. That&#039;s prompted a flurry of speculation that the DEA had infiltrated the infamous Silk Road website, an off-the-grid marketplace where drugs are traded and Bitcoins are the only accepted currency.<br /><br />“This is the first time something like this has happened with Bitcoin,” Adam B. Levine, editor and chief of the website Let&#039;s Talk Bitcoin!, which tracks developments with the currency and first reported on the seizure. “And the interesting subtext is: We don&#039;t have any idea just how involved the DEA is with Bitcoins.”<br /><br />Bitcoins are basically an Internet equivalent of cash, a so-called “crypto-currency” that can be sent directly to other users with no involvement from banks or middle men.<br /><br />Introduced in 2009, Bitcoins have been a hot investment item of late and are the currency of choice for online drug dealers and other black market traders.<br /><br />“Bitcoins themselves do not provide anonymity guarantees, but their design makes it possible for transactions to be much harder to trace than traditional payment systems like credit cards or ACH (Automated Clearing House electronic credit) transfers,” Nicolas Christin, associate director of the Information Networking Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, said.<br /><br />The DEA stated it seized the coins from Hughes, also known as “Casey Jones,” in April, but the agency hasn&#039;t charged him with a crime.<br /><br />Attempts to reach Hughes were unsuccessful last week, and it is unclear if he has an attorney. No one answered the door when a reporter visited his St. Philip Street apartment last week.<br /><br />DEA officials would not discuss his case except to say it concerns an ongoing investigation being run by the DEA&#039;s Los Angeles field office. Two agency spokeswomen said they knew of no other forfeiture cases nationally involving Bitcoins.<br /><br />Charleston police also moved against Hughes last month, charging him with distributing marijuana and prescription pills after a June 5 raid on his apartment, according to county court records and a police incident report. The charges stem from 10 bags of the narcotic Suboxone found in Hughes&#039; bedroom during the search and two undercover drug buys that occurred in April, according to arrest affidavits. He is accused of selling .77 grams of the muscle relaxant Clozepam and 10.7 grams of marijuana to informants working with police, the affidavits said.<br /><br />The search of his apartment also uncovered digital scales, a small amount of marijuana, various white powders and pills, computer equipment, a loaded pistol and other items, a police report noted.<br /><br />Charleston police would not discuss the case, referring all questions to the DEA.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look how pale and pastry this boy is.

				Like most every other case of a SR&#039;r getting busted, it was IRL activity that brought the heat. <br /><br />The whole ฿tc connection is media spin. If they seized his ฿tc, I&#039;d like to know what they&#039;re holding them in!~! <br /><br />Though with the Gov&#039;t crackdown on all the exchanges, it does make one a little nervous about it all. <br /><br />Be safe, be careful, encrypt, tumble, etc. <br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug 8)

				We all knew it was casey jones before it was even published, i remember the thread where everyone was trying to work out who the vendor was that got busted, Half the members on here should be PI&#039;s. <br />haha I knew it, What a mugshot as well I always wonder what some of the people im dealing with look like, Its human nature to imagine what someone looks like when talking to them whether its via phone or the deepweb, so i had to laugh like fuck when i saw his mugshot.<br /><br />Check this out. Quote from the article.<br />&quot;“People don&#039;t go there to hang out and have a good time,” Levine, of Let&#039;s Talk Bitcoin!, said. “They go there because there are specific things you can do there.”&quot; Haha bullshit plenty of people chill and hang out in the forums.

As far as how they got access to his bitcoins: I&#039;d assume he gave the DEA his Silkroad password, or the DEA searched through his things and found the password. If he was keeping them in an online wallet, it&#039;s possible the website turned the bitcoins over to the DEA; but I think it&#039;s much more likely that this guy was interrogated and told them everything.

Even more so when both are found in the same place, and that includes foreign (and now digital) currencies.

It seems like the BTC seizure set the ball in motion and the raid of his house followed. <br /><br />This timeline of events more supports the theory that he did something dumb on SR that led to his arrest.<br /><br />Just my .0002 BTC <br />;D
