				Hi.&nbsp; You will probably find what you need on the hidden wiki&nbsp; http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page<br /><br />There is a section on file hosting but not sure about actual web design.&nbsp; It might help you out though.

				I was far from contradicting the services here on the deep web.&nbsp; What i meant to say was that because we are all anonymous everyone seems to be more &quot;together&quot; down here on the deep web.&nbsp; Therefore i felt people simply might make it easier to join certain said services.&nbsp; And, of course, anonymity is a god send for all of us and i respect everyone here who needs it.<br />Sometimes i have a hard time explaining myself properly the first time around, so please forgive!.<br />Oh, and just to rub it in a bit ..... ::)<br />Just kidding, of course!.

				Apart from hosting ... does anyone know how to make a website? I used to make normal websites with Wordpress, but I&#039;m not sure if these hosts (or Tor) allows scripts like these. Most deepweb sites I&#039;ve seen are very basic. In fact, I&#039;m kinda surprised this forum is running on Simple Machines. I wish I knew more about what I&#039;m talking about. I used to make websites growing up, but I haven&#039;t for a couple of years or more.

If you have lots of media and all that your connection would be really really slow or time out. It`be 56k all over again.
