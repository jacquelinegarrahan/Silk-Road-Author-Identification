				Hi folks.&nbsp; First of all, great to finally be here, funnily enough I discovered it&#039;s existence from a news report some time ago (thanks sky news&nbsp; ;D).&nbsp; Anyway, I&#039;ve had a little search through here but before i get my bit coins I wanted to just confirm something from one of you good folks if possible?&nbsp; I heard that there are places you can go and buy bitcoins for cash in high streets/banks, is that so? (UK)<br />I&#039;ve found numerous sites offering bc&#039;s, all of them basically ask for the address to send the bc&#039;s to (the one in my account section on sr I take it?).&nbsp; Should I be doing this via the tor proxy?&nbsp; Or is it ok to just do that through normal browser and it will find it&#039;s way to my silkroad account twisting and turning to hide me?&nbsp; Ultimately i&#039;m in the uk, if any other uk&#039;ers, if thats relevant, could tell me the best place to go that i can just pay for some bc&#039;s and get them onto my sr account I&#039;d appreciate it.&nbsp; Bare in mind im relatively simple minded, took me ages to figure out how to just get here, so any info is gonna be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Many thanks and looking forward to this!<br /><br />Oh before I forget, I found various sites offering the kind of &#039;pay per click&#039; revenue systems, only paying in bitcoins instead, would it be safe to use those to?&nbsp; One in particular doesn;t ask for name/address, just the bitcoin address.<br />Righty, thats it now, sorry to be a pain&nbsp; :P

				I had a lot of trouble with this when I first started. If you go to Bitinstant.com they offer a service that essentially creates an invoice which you can use to pay a company to send you their bitcoins. They have a deal going with a number of major banks, I&#039;m not sure if any of them are in the U.K though. You don&#039;t need an account at the bank, you literally just walk in with cash in hand and the invoice, tell the teller you&#039;d like to make a payment to the account on the invoice, and once that&#039;s done you call the company and tell &#039;em you&#039;ve paid and tell them where to send your coins. Like I said though, I&#039;m not sure if any of these banks operate in the U.K, I know the main three are Citi Bank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, but there may be more, I&#039;d go and check if I were you. This definitly isn&#039;t the only way to get them though, so if you can&#039;t do it from where you are don&#039;t worry.

I read a couple Silk-Road how-to&#039;s and they both said to do that but I&#039;m a noob as well and I could just be overly paranoid. Just don&#039;t access your Mt.Gox account via TOR or they will freeze it.

				If you are in the UK use intersango, do not put bitcoin straight from there or Mt. Gox into SR, put it in your bitcoin wallet first then onto SR.

				Ok gang, thanks to the help you all gave me I think i&#039;m ready to give things a go :).&nbsp; Got me some bcoins floating around various wallets (they enjoy travelling), just downloaded the gpg stuff and about to sort that ready for communicating with sellers that require it, setup a tormail account to include in the key thing for that to...&nbsp; <br />Think I&#039;ve covered pretty much everything I need to in order to keep my previous paranoia at an easy to handle level.&nbsp; Found me some amazing sellers and now spoiled for choice, things gonna be fun from here!&nbsp; Thank you all again and will let you all know how my first buy goes, oh and will post the gpg key thingamejigga in the thread I noticed for doing so.&nbsp; Wish me luck&nbsp; &nbsp;:D :D
