				Well naturally if you&#039;re withdrawaling or suffering PAWS from opiates you&#039;re going to be depressed...it takes a few months to get out of it sometimes. Any time I have gotten off heroin and gone through the physical aspect, the mental part/depression takes a few months to subside.<br /><br />Also, when you&#039;re using opiates it really throws you&#039;re normal &quot;thinking&quot; off balance. I IVed daily and sometimes would go through horrible depression because of stress in my life and even though I was getting euphoria from opiates it was also making my depression worse.

				I&#039;ve always taken the view what goes up must come down when taking drugs. It&#039;s great to be high but there&#039;s going to be a price to pay. When I come off opiates I get really emotional for the first week or so, cry easily thinking about things I&#039;ve fucked up with, mistakes I&#039;ve made, etc. I just dig in and wait for it to pass. I wouldn&#039;t say being on heroin makes me depressed, if someone gave me a lifetime supply I think I could function pretty well and not really be affected mentally but different strokes for different folks. It&#039;s what a habit does to life that makes me depressed, rather than the habit itself, if that makes any sense.

				I don&#039;t have time to go in to a bunch of details but when I was taking 300-400 mg&#039;s of oxy a day along with daily heroin use for 4 years I had horrible anxiety and depression for 2-3 years after I quit. This is just my experience with it but I was never like that untill I quit. Much better these days, though.

				Uh, yah heroin use causes major depression especially if you are a heavy long term user. I don&#039;t think my brain has ever recovered from my years of heroin addiction. I don&#039;t feel like things excite me or affect me in the same way anymore and this is after being off heroin for a long time and even when I was drug free for a year I still didn&#039;t ever feel like I did before heroin use. While heavily addicted I wished I would OD and do huge amounts of dope hoping I would not wake up out of a nod. I was miserable....
