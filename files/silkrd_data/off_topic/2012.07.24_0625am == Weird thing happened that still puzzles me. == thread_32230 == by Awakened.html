				So, for introduction,&nbsp; i´m a young caucasian male living in one of the european countrys which has pretty strict drug laws and a few months ago something happened that is still on my mind and i can´t understand how is this possible. I went for a night out and accidentally grabbed a wrong drink, something was mixed in it so just after a one drink i lost my memory and as i later heard, i became violent and police took me away for sobering. But that is not my main question, thing that puzzels me is that i had ounce of weed with me in my bag, i had smaller amount of weed in my pocket and a little pipe. As i woke up in the morning remembering nothing from last night events, i searched my pockets, they had took my cellphone and wallet but weed and the pipe was still there and i even took a hit in the morning because of the tremendeous headache. Later they released me, weed in my bag was still there and they didn´t say nothing to me. Just gave me back my wallet and cellphone and i was free to go. How could they ignore such a thing?

				Not all LEs are douche bags. In fact, more of them than ever before do not agree with most drug laws currently in place.<br /><br />Not saying that you can trust them... you got really lucky... but really, they don&#039;t make the laws. They&#039;re just told they have to enforce them.<br />

				Just be grateful that they were kind and didn&#039;t bust you with possession.&nbsp; You really dodged a bullet man.

				Many cops, especially those under 40, have grown up around drugs and many will ignore cannabis IF its not being dealt.<br /><br />I got pulled and we had a fairly nice bag of skunk, half oz or so. Cop found it, asked whose it was, I took the rap and told the cop I liked to chill out but only smoked in the garden at home and kept the weed in a safe.<br /><br />We went on our merry way.<br /><br />Always pays to be polite to cops.<br /><br />Give the &#039;the attitude&#039; and swagger and your nicked or arrested.<br /><br />Cops are just people. Some good, some bad. Many are streetwise and will have buddies outside the 999 or 911 posse. They see drugs being used but let a lot go unless they see some asshole swinging a kilo of coke or bragging how much they made. Many will do an on the spot fine also because cops are judged by how much they make. That is wrong, a good cop usually makes good arrests of deserving bastards. Using cops to earn revenue makes ALL the public turn against them.
