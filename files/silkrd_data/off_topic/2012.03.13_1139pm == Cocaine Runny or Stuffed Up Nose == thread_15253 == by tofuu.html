				<br />Does anyone know of any good ways to minimize the nose effects of snorting a little coke?&nbsp; I get stuffed up a couple of hours later and if I do too much, my nose starts to get very runny for a little while.&nbsp; I try antihistamines and nasal decongestants, but they only work to a certain degree.&nbsp; Has anyone tried anything other then injecting that works to minimize this problem?&nbsp; I&#039;m not a frequent or long-term user, but I try a G or so every now and then from SR...<br /><br />For those of you who are about to answer &quot;...just don&#039;t do the shit...&quot;, please GFY and save it...that&#039;s not the question.<br /><br />Any advice is appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				do better quality cocaine&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />typically iv found a blocked nose indicates cutting agents. Though im sure theres other reasons...<br /><br />i also like to clean my nose after each line or two. 30-40 odd minutes in, wet your finger, give a tiny bit of water a sniff. pinch your nose. (it can actually intensify the high if any cokes stuck up around there) and then 10 minutes or so later give it a blow...<br /><br />

				please use distilled water or a saline solution. you can buy saline nasal spray for like a couple bucks which is sterile and the best option. this is definitely a great idea to keep your membranes rinsed which help reduce any damage from the powder and help absorb any of that pesky residue hiding <br /><br />the reason is there is a nasty eukaryotic microorganism known as acanthamoeba which can live in municipal water systems. when this microbe is exposed to the nasal membranes,&nbsp; it can actually cross this barrier and make its way into the brain. Once in the CNS, acanthamoeba causes encephalopathy caused by the inflammation and cytokine damage from the infection and is difficult to treat because of how similar the cells are to human cells compared to bacteria. Frighteningly, these eukaryotes literally eat your brain which is unfortunately frequently lethal. <br /><br />I guess infections are not that common, but in the name of safety I avoid tap water and use a saline spray myself. <br />Be safe, have fun!<br />- miR
