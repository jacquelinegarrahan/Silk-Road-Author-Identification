				I am a buyer of cannabis, mainly hash, but the BTC rate is now 7.50 to the £<br />Back in June this was 4.50 average to the £. This means SR &amp; the sellers are coining it in.<br />I and many fellow buyers I have spoken to are buying a lot less &amp; some are not buying at all.<br />The seller prices need to come down before this gets stupid &amp; folk start to drift away from SR<br />&amp; go back to their street dealers again. A lot of these buyers may never come back. How about some<br />methiod by SR to regulate prices?

				This already exists, vendors can tie the price of their goods to the USD or the BTC. Quite a few of the listings are actually tied to USD not BTC that i&#039;ve noticed. <br /><br />Depending on the area you are in the prices on SR just might not be competitive but in some areas they are very competitive.

All listings should be tied to the $ - not the volatile BTC rate. Very few are $ tied from what I can see so when they cash out in BTC they&#039;re getting more $/£/euro to their BTC are they not?

				The point I think Digiking is making is that, regardless of the mechanism employed, the current inflated BTC rate is rendering prices on SR out of reach for many buyers. I happen to agree with this. Once a regular buyer, I haven&#039;t bought anything in ages. Waiting for the rate to come down - or for sellers to modify their prices - whichever comes first.<br /><br />+1 Digiking for a point well made.

				Regardless of your opinion, ultimately<br /><br />_It&#039;s the SELLERS choice_<br /><br />So complaining doesn&#039;t do any good here ::)<br /><br />_MOST_ vendors tie their prices to USD and NOT BTC, but the ones that do have their reasons and I&#039;d leave it at that.

I have told friends about this site &amp; they&#039;re coming back to say it&#039;s too expensive for them &amp; thus SR is in danger of drying up. Greed will kill the Golden Goose! PS I will still buy but less often. SR is the bollocks &amp; I want her to survive!

				Most of the vendors I speak to tie their prices to the BTC. Didn&#039;t realize unhedged was that uncommon.&nbsp; :-\
