				Hi, I have an EXTREMELY low tolerance to shrooms, The first time I tripped I experienced total loss of reality and ego at only .67 grams(it was a really overwhelming bad trip, but a good learning experience) and can have noticeable visual effects at much less than that.&nbsp; I am wondering if my tolerance to all psychedelics will be similarly low?&nbsp; From what I have read I will also have an extremely low tolerance to lsd, but will it be similar with all psychedelics like dmt or 2c-b?&nbsp; Will I have similarly low tolerance to mdma or ketamine?&nbsp; I don&#039;t think so from what I have read, but I figured I&#039;d ask anyway.&nbsp; Thanks for taking your time out to answer my somewhat dumb question.

				Well from experience I can tell you that your tolerance levels of shrooms and 2C-B will be the same, so if you have low shroom tolerance then your 2C-B tolerance will be low too.<br /><br />MDMA is completely different and your tolerance is based on your serotonin receptors, even if it is low you shouldn&#039;t take it more than once every 2 to 3 weeks anyway due to it&#039;s other effects, although it is perfectly safe as long as you have a healthy balanced diet &amp; lifestyle.<br /><br />I can&#039;t comment on the other drugs.

				Tolerance is different for everyone my friend. You may not be so &#039;lightweight&#039; to shrooms as you think, you could have just been in a bad setting and let paranoia over come you, making it overwhelming. Torrance mostly depends on BMI and metabolism rates, also how often you take the drug and cross tolerance. <br />If you have a low BMI, like me, you are most likely going to have a lower tolerance compared to someone who has a high BMI. But this works in your advantage because it means you dont have to spend as much money on drugs :)<br />remember always start on a very low dosage when trying new drugs, you can always work your way up and you have nothing to lose :) For example, start with 0.10g of shrooms and then just work your way up until you find a comfortable dose!
