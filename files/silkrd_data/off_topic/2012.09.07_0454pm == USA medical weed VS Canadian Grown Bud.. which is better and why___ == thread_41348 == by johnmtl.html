				So here/s my 2 cents. I know a lot of Americans these days think because some states have &quot;legal&quot; weed that they must produce the best bud anywhere (maybe its the big American ego).<br /><br />I think not. I have been to both Colorado and California and smoke &quot;medical&quot; weed from both states.... I must say there were a few nice strains and they were grown alright but most of the stuff i saw and smoked was crap...<br /><br />I mentioned to one of the workers there that I am from Canada and he told me this weed is better then any Canadian weed out there.<br /><br />I think its a grave error on the part of the Americans to think that because they have been growing weed for a few years that all of a sudden there top greenthumbs..<br /><br />I know in my area growing weed is passed down from grandfather to father to son.. its been in our blood for decades and due to our lax drug laws people have been doing this for there whole life...for example.. in the states you get caught with a warehouse full of plants your going away for some years.. here its a fine and maybe a year a max.. you see the risk vs reward has been way better on our side of the border and therefore i believe that it only makes sense that the best weed in the world comes from canada!!!<br /><br /><br />anyone else wanna chime in with a view???<br /><br />I just want to know why you guys from the states think your weed is the bomb above all others?

				It&#039;s really inaccurate to say one is better then the other because that is simply not true. It all depends on the grower and genetics. There are people all over the world with great genetics growing top shelf medicinal mj.<br /><br />And to answer your question about why americans think their weed is better, well, you&#039;re clearly talking to inexperienced people. The real people who actually know what they are talking about know that anyone with great growing skills and genetics can have amazing weed, any where. I suggest talking to people who actually know something about weed before making judgement on all americans.

				But don&#039;t you think the quote &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; applies here..<br /><br />I mean the more experience you have the better the weed will be....Surely!<br /><br />you could have a clone from a cannabis cup winner but without the proper skill set I&#039;m sure the plant will suck.<br /><br />I also wanna say that obviously there is shit weed here in canada too but in the big picture we produce mass amounts of high quality bud and have been for decades... how can a grower who is in the game a few years supposed to compete with that?

				&quot;Nigger please&quot; is a slang term used by only african americans, you&#039;re wrong some more....<br /><br />As I stated above I don&#039;t think america is the best.

				I don&#039;t think it matters if the person growing the weed is American or Canadian. I pretty sure the plant doesn&#039;t care.<br /><br />You are viewing us all as extensions of the State, rather then individuals.

It is raw business. It transcends borders. All growers have basically come to terms with the &#039;fuck the government&#039; mentality whether they live in Canada or the US. They hold no allegiance to the flag. They have their own flag. They live on little islands in a big sea. If you want to define (or use someone else&#039;s definition) which islands are on which side and debate who is better that is fine, but people are reacting to it negatively because they don&#039;t like perceiving the world through such a jaded lens. Lets let the best herb be good for something other then whether it is Canadian or American.<br /><br />If this were hockey we would have our own team, the jerseys would be green, and we would be winning.

				I really dont think this question can be answered. As far a the quality of cannabis is concerned, the best medical grade cannabis is not a matter of Canada, US, Amsterdam, Spain, or any other country versus another. Medical grade cannabis can be grown in any country, but it is the genetics and the farmer that determine the quality of medicine produced. On that note, I will say that as far as farming goes, the US has the best farmers and more of them than any other place on earth. Consequently, we (The States) have that shit on lock. No offense.

				ninjers please...<br /><br />it&#039;s not about mimicking. it&#039;s about enhancing. the co2 optimal level potential is much much higher than the atmospheres level. that&#039;s why many outdoorsy&#039;s actually supplement outdoor co2. and the indoor is about creating the most perfect environment. Indoor will always have higher potential than outs. And i&#039;ve seen some great outs... i mean great fuckin outdoor strains all covered in crystals they could easily pass for indoor. in fact... i&#039;m smoking some right now!<br /><br />and let&#039;s talk about regions. it&#039;s actually the light spectrum and cbd&#039;s that are more prominent away from the border. (northern lights?) in which thc production is a protective act of the plant for cbd spectrum. few growers really use cbd enhancement during later flowering and fewer even know about them. <br /><br /><br />My thoughts exactly what space said in first or second post of theirs... <br /><br />Genetics and grower. The industry has taken numerous leaps as well. Genes don&#039;t even matter if grower and nutes are shit. <br /><br />And it doesn&#039;t matter what you saw at a club. They can call anything MEDICAL grade but that means shit. I&#039;ve witnessed and heard many stories of dispensaries spraying their shit with toxic crap and selling it. The medical game is hardly about health. Real true growers from where the fuck ever are the ones that covet thy strain of the gods. They search and tinker until they find something perfect. And then they keep searching and continue to up the ante ad infinitum. <br /><br />it&#039;s really all grower. time. attention. love. + genes!<br /><br />even decent growers pic early. biggest most used mistake.

Who checks the hairs on the bud for ripeness? Let me tell you, novices. Any seasoned grower knows to check trichome heads for clear/cloudy/amber to w/e effect they desire. It&#039;s not a right or wrong&nbsp; better/worse thing, it&#039;s more of a personal preference.

				Bro, I&#039;m not a grower nor am i even close nor did i ever claim to be.. you cant say my argument is invalid because I said &quot;they make sure the hairs are red&quot;...what i meant was CANADA GROWS THE BEST, MOST TAKEN CARE OF WEED IN THE WORLD!! <br /><br />The fact of the matter is I believe one thing and you believe an other, I have many friends through the states (NY, TX, CA) whom I send bud to on a regular basis, they were all born in canada and have been living in the states for at least 10 years (the have connects there as well) but every time I send them something they always tell me that we grow the best bud..<br /><br /><br />We must agree to disagree... its simple...<br /><br />no matter what I say you will still think that the US produces the best bud...<br />

				I never said the U.S. produces the best weed. I specifically said that anyone anywhere is growing great weed if they have the genetics and growing skills, which people do have world wide.
