				I&#039;m a Nigerian hitman who can help you out in obtaining many infants. Unfortunately I currently have no tools to do the job discreetly. If you would kindly send me $30,000 I promise I can provide to you 3 infants immediately. After that point I can begin to give you 1 dead body per week of various ages, ethnicity, and genders. I will only charge you $20k per week for all subsequent bodies you receive.

The movie we&#039;re talking about is called &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot;. A very awkward, but decent enough film.<br /><br />You&#039;re referencing the movie literally titled &quot;Deadgirl&quot;. That&#039;s the movie about the two high school boys who discover a zombie like woman locked in the bottom of a mental hospital (I think, or prison?), that will not die no matter what. Then the boys decide to fuck the woman as they&#039;re both virgins and very fucked up in the head. That movie actually sucks dick. <br /><br />If anyone wants a decent, and very creepy, horror movie I would recommend &quot;May&quot;. Not a lot of gore, just really fucking weird.

SWIM just happened to visit his mother-in-law and well one thing led to another and he accidentally stabbed her 2-3 times.... And I, oops I mean SWIM, wondered if I could sell them by weight, so SWIM has more of a business to live up to. Cuz you know, some people weigh 50kg, some 100kg and this mother-in-law is a whale... So by pound would be the smartest... I guess........

				Well that was disturbing. I don&#039;t think you killed your mother-in-law though because everyone wants to kill their mother-in-law and you&#039;d be the number one subject.
