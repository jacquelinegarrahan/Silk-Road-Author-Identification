				Hey there, Viscoto here, Bit of a new guy here, made a few purchases, testing the waters for now, waiting for my 25I-NBOMe to get here... you know, under my lip n shit ^.- So I devised a question for you all. What kind of drug user do you call yourself? I&#039;ll demonstrate!<br /><br />I like drugs, period. Now, don&#039;t get me wrong, i&#039;m by far from a junkie&#039;s perspective. In fact, i&#039;m kinda like drug user lite, in a sense. I never over do anything, and always take my drugs slowly, more in it for the full experience, than to purely &quot;Get high&quot;. And i have had great trips as well. off few substances. Mush, MDMA, hell i have even had a trip on pot once. I&#039;ve also done my fair share of opiates, but never in high amounts, though i am willing to try now that i have built up some what of a tolerance to the drug. and have always wanted an H experiment. though, it would never be around me (until now), but thats the least on my &quot;todo list&quot; of drugs great and far above that. Never had LSD, Never tried RCs. Want to, so so badly, but the LSD prices are just too steep for me to experiment atm. for you see, i want a first time LSD experiment, with a great amount of LSD.. 4-7 hits, for my first try. Because already know i will like it. ^_^ your turn.

				Are you asking what area of drugs we&#039;re into? Psychadelics, opiates, dissociatives, etc.?<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried substances of all kinds, and eventually found myself hugely into uppers. Methamphetamine, MDMA, good coke, etc. If it woke me the fuck up, I loved it. That&#039;s probably because I&#039;m naturally a very tired and lethargic person.<br /><br />Recently I&#039;ve wanted to start using opiates again. I&#039;m now a full time student and full time worker, so I would really like a way to just &quot;chill&quot; and feel nice when I have time off of either. I&#039;ll still roll once a month, and rail a couple lines of meth when I have to be up for more than a day, but I&#039;m going to hold off on partying hard until next summer.
