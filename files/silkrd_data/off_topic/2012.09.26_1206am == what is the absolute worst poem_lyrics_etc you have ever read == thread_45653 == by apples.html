				A large group of my friends are HUGE fucking Dave Matthews fans for some reason. The fact that people like this douchebag&#039;s music is unreal.&nbsp; Moreover, out of all of these friends of mine, none of them have followed in their master Dave&#039;s footsteps by ever once eating a magic mushroom or tab of lucy. so how the hell do they like stupid shit like...<br /><br />&quot;What would you say&quot;<br /><br />...I was there, when the Bear eat is head; he thought it was candy!!
