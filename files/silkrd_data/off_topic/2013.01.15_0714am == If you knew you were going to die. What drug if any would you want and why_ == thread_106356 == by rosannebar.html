				I was just thinking.&nbsp; If you found out or felt that you only had a short time left on this earth we share.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would you want to try and drug that you had been scared to before?&nbsp; Would you want to be sober?&nbsp; &nbsp;I have always had anxiety issues, fear of death, panic attacks, hypocondriac, that kinda thing.&nbsp; So I have always been more into downers, I avoid anything like speed, or acid because of the fear of it killing me or being out of control.&nbsp; &nbsp; But, honestly,&nbsp; i kind of think that if I were at my last week or day,&nbsp; &nbsp;I would want to push the limits.&nbsp; &nbsp; What about you?

				Me? Regardless of if I was going to die or not. I would stick with marijuana and spend as much time as I could with my family. Marijuana calms my mind, and over all, makes me a more compassionate person. <br /><br />That is how I want to be remembered if I were to kick the bucket. A compassionate family guy.

				if i knew i was about to die, i would want to experience more of reality, not less of it.<br /><br />hence i would avoid mind-dulling drugs that put you into a stupor..... i would avoid drugs that give you a euphoria without content. i would want a meaningful experience, not just a euphoric experience<br /><br />so i would probably take LSD

				I&#039;ve never tried mescaline or peyote, so I would really love to try them if I was on my death bed. Also, some high doses of LSD. And of course DMT. Basically anything psychedelic! :)

				Would probably say heroin. Never wanna try that shit. Read a book about a guys life on it. FUCKED his life up. like FUCKED up. This dude could of literally be sippin on golden cups and this motherfucker (straight guy) was gettin his dick sucked by another dude for money to get his next fix.<br />I heard the high is like NOTHING else though. He even said it in the book. That would be the reason I&#039;d try it. Plus I think I&#039;d feel nice right before you die. Kill any pain and just make you feel no other way.<br />Would probably want to try some research chemicals too&nbsp; ::)

				I can get high off of about 130mg of the MDMA I sell - so that means I would eat one of the biggest crystals I have, which would be around 13 grams.<br /><br />I have always wondered what a dose that high would feel like - I am aware that I would probably die at the peak, though.

				Interesting topic. Knowing me, I would probably go on a bender and take everything I could get my hands on. I mean, if I&#039;m gonna dies soon then there&#039;s no reason to hold back. But I&#039;d end with a thumbprint dose of LSD because A. Taking a serious (1mg+) dose of LSD is on my bucket list and B. LSD has been shown to help people with end-of-life anxiety enormously.

				Death is easier to pontificate about when it&#039;s not immediately in front of you.&nbsp; It surprises me that so many people say they want to do LSD to more clearly understand the experience.&nbsp; When you&#039;re actually forced to face the reality of your mortality, things like &#039;clear white light&#039; and &#039;creator&#039; can start to sound like euphemisms for something that&#039;s too awful for most people to talk about.&nbsp; Death is, after all, permanent.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Then again, according to record, Albert Hoffman asked his wife to give him LSD shortly before he died.&nbsp; Gotta respect that. :-)&nbsp; So obviously it can affect people differently.&nbsp; <br /><br />As for me, it depends on what kind of death was coming.&nbsp; If it was going to be painful, terrifying or unpleasant in some other way, I&#039;d take a heroin overdose instead-- to die on my own terms, quickly and painlessly.&nbsp;
