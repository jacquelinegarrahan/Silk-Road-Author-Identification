Poor thing needed a visit to the dentist. Got a bit of shit in a cavity, now in all sorts of bother. Not to worry, a bit of blow up the nostril will numb that right up.

				You&#039;re right, I do need more substances in me. I could really write myself off here. Got a docs certificate for a WHOLE WEEK off, I&#039;ve already notified work, so that&#039;s all sweet. Spoken to mum (she said to say hi btw Hoff, and thanks for cleaning out her gutters... Whatever that&#039;s supposed to mean), so won&#039;t need to chat to her for another week or so. Just worried that I won&#039;t be able to make it up to the bank tomorrow so I can get some more BTC. <br /><br />I&#039;ll see what I can do! How does 2cb go after coke?

				Decided I want some of this 2cb, but have no way to tell the weight. I got it from Sunshine ages ago, but unsure if I ordered 100mg or 200mg. I can still see the feedback that I left him, which is for 100mg, but I think I may have ordered x 2. My scales only do .1 and even then they&#039;re dodgy as fuck, and it didn&#039;t really register on them at all. Thinking I&#039;ll split it all up into 10 even lines. <br /><br />BTW Hoff, I made an account (free) with one of those sites back in the day. Logged onto most of the cams and wrote &#039;There&#039;s someone behind you!!&#039;. Hilarious. One of the chicks actually pooped herself, but I&#039;m not sure if that was part of the cam show or not. Get a good reaction out of it anyway.&nbsp; 8)

				morning all, i&#039;m afraid the legend that is Bigglesworth is now just a memory - i know him and his fox of a mrs IRL (he introduced me to this site and by the way, Chrispo&#039;s impression is pretty accurate to how he talks IRL) apparently his security has been compromised on here so he&#039;s keeping :-X . he&#039;s still ordering on the Road but not boasting about how fucked up he gets here any more in case he&#039;s being watched. probably too much coke and smoke has made him ultra paranoid but in all fairness i&#039;d fuck off if i got scared. he didn&#039;t get that battered this weekend due to the accident - i went round there when he got out of hospital (still limping cache ;D ;) ) and shared his last speaker with him (ahhh, how sweet ;) ), then we smoked about an eighth of skunk the next day and got attacked by the munchies.<br /><br />hoffa - myfreecams is ancient mate, i suppose you know of pornhub and bangyoulater?

Those things are a must while tripping alone!<br /><br />A workmate was kind enough to drop over a whole box on endone which he had left over from a broken arm. Bless his soul. As soon as he left I crushed up 3 and sniffed as much as I could. Only got through 2 I think and had to eat the rest. Come on pretty quickly!

				out of interest, how do you transfer your BTC to SR? i take it you use instawallet or equivalent? i&#039;m asking because i&#039;ve just downloaded the bitcoin client, i thought it&#039;d be more secure than Intersango/Mt Gox&gt;InstaWallet 1&gt;Instawallet 2&gt;SR, and the part of the BTC client that gives you your BTC address is fucking ridiculous - you have to copy the address out, there&#039;s no way to copy and paste it. just wondered if i&#039;m missing something?

BW&#039;s other half would eat you alive, shes just got that look about her that she&#039;s an animal that would chew up us mere mortals<br /><br />chrispo - you NEED to weigh out 2cb my friend, tried that with BW a few weeks back (he kept banging on about wrinkly fingers or something so i went for a walk) and it&#039;s heavy - we only did less than 20mg (&lt;0.02) each and we were el-spanko-d. it&#039;s alright after a few lines and a few beers, doesn&#039;t really mess with the buzz, but if you don&#039;t measure it out it will destroy you.<br /><br />BW said it&#039;s much better after an E or some MDMA, you don&#039;t need half as much - i&#039;ve yet to try this so i can&#039;t confirm it, but i do tend to believe whatever that fuckup says when it comes to chemicals ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I call bullshit! Biggles misses is a sweet heart she is VERY &quot;opened&quot; and &quot;welcoming&quot; Been really busy but really want to share part two of my &quot;fucking with the supervisor&quot; story. Promise you its is a fucking cracker!<br /><br />Stay tuned...<br /><br />Hey Raoul are you a pool cleaner? Every time I see your name I think of some small Guido the killer pimp pool cleaner.<br /><br />CAche tell me more about the flesh light? were you using it on him? What degree of pain (in your professional opinion) did he feel? <br /><br />Back later....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah i must admit Raoul is a bit of a pool cleaners name. for those of you who haven&#039;t read/seen one of the greatest books/films ever made it&#039;s Hunter S Thompsons alter ego :P<br /><br />Biggles missus is a man eater mate, i&#039;m telling you. she was &#039;hot girl of the week&#039; on FaceBook a coupla years back, so she is fit as fuck. i&#039;m just trying to find a pic of her without giving up any personal info. i&#039;ve seen a few pix n vids of them in the act on BW&#039;s phone and shes a dirty bitch, fucking filthy. was probably her idea to get the fleshlight. i am insanely jealous. hes actually quite a good cameraman while on the job

Have you guessed why I am not here often at the moment? Because as much as I loved head fucking my supervisor. Really didnt expect his bitch ass to crack and quit. And while at the time the whole situation was funny as fuck! (My office will talk about this for years to come ;)) I was promoted up with more pay, which again seems to be all good. Let me tell you, I am the guy that does fuck all and likes it that way. My life was perfect, roll to work late, leave early, if the wind is blowing, fuck work in exchange for a wind surf. Not accountable to anyone except cunt lips, flirt with the office girlies and be admired? Long lunches early breakfasts client expense card, regular travel. All was Very, Very Excellent.<br /><br />This my friends has all changed :-[ In what could be my very last work time post. I am drowning the sorrows of my what is now my collapsed world with my ice coffee in what hand and my very last Rastaman space cooking...<br /><br />The sad reality is now this.<br /><br />1. I have a team which I am now responsible for. The same people that once admired and encouraged my office shenanigans, now look at me with contempt. I have even heard whispers of me becoming the new &quot;cunt lips&quot; A name which I proudly gave to my ex super. Add to this the fact I need to &quot;dress accordingly&quot; I do in fact look into the mirror and at certain angles to be honest actually see my &quot;cunt lips&quot; growing before my eyes.<br /><br />2. My working hours are now set in stone. &quot;I am Expected&quot; to arrive at the office each morning at 7:30am and to leave after everyone else leaves which means at least 5:30pm. I must present to my team at 9:30am the days projects and unfinished urgent work needs. In the past I have not known anything before 9:28am and to be honest usually 9:50 after I mess around and walk in during ex cunt lips announcement. With a mouth full of food proudly apologize for being late, while continuing to irate chad by talking to others about, sport, movies, or how the wife tried a new sexual position on me. Most importantly I will miss saying the following each and every morning. &quot;Oh Chad can you in point form write up what was talked about today, as I hadn&#039;t realized I was supposed to be listening&quot; In my first meeting I have already noticed wanna be Hoffa&#039;s starting to appear, and while they were annoying and patronizing to me, the little Hoffa inside me was envious of the attention the newbies were getting and to a certain degree I was proud of the legacy cool Hoffa had left behind.<br /><br />3. And lastly and what was one part of my job I sincerely liked and was good at &#039;Must now cease immediately as I am to remember the position I have been placed in&quot; I am no longer able to (what is referred now as) &quot;sexually harass any employee or place them in a position that they may see or deem inappropriate&quot;&nbsp; I shit you not my friends, these exact words were in black and white on the employment contract I needed to sign. To say when I read it I was offended would be an understatement! I even emailed it over to a lawyer mate to ask if this is even legal. His response was short and painful. STFU you dickhead, You really need to stop calling me every time you get a fucked up issue. This news obviously sat me on my ass. I immediately notice a change in the office girls, no more smiles but sniggering comments, &quot;he is not seriously wearing that&quot; or does he really think he is cool&quot;&nbsp; Yet only last week my comments were followed be giggles of anticipation from these warm &quot;welcoming&quot; women &quot;you are such a bad man&quot; or &quot;I will go for a drink with you only because you are married and I can trust you right?&quot; Knowing fore-well trust is something that could ever be used to describe the old Hoffa)<br /><br />Alas as the cookie is now in full effect and the fact that I have no one else to blame is slowly dawning on me, I ponder what my life will be. My advise to all of you that has taken the time to read the journey I have allowed myself to travel. Be respectful to those above you, as the repercussion of your actions (no matter how funny it is at the time) is far greater than any free man can comprehend. <br /><br />Goodby my friends<br /><br />Hoffa (but realistically and to be honest) Cunt Lips

				been out of class A&#039;s for nearly 2 weeks now and FUCK am i getting ratty &gt;:(&nbsp; my temper is at dangerous levels. smoking cigs like they&#039;re going out of fashion and all the skunk i&#039;m smoking isn&#039;t helping. well, it is, but only after i&#039;ve smoked it - can&#039;t be stoned at work. daren&#039;t have a beer, it&#039;ll probably make me snap if i see anything i don&#039;t like. i&#039;m doing well not to go to my local contact, but i&#039;m sober enough to know it&#039;s not going to be worth £50 (that would have to be on tic anyway) and i&#039;ll be even more pissed off.<br /><br />it&#039;s not like i&#039;m on coke or H all day every day when i have it, it&#039;s just a weekend thing, but i think the fact that i know i can&#039;t have any this weekend is really grating on me<br /><br />roll on payday... well, about 5 days after payday to be precise. i&#039;m sure i&#039;ll calm down once i get a couple of bits in transit<br /><br />by class A&#039;s i mean coke and/or H - E&#039;s don&#039;t count in my book, they shouldn&#039;t be class A anyway.

				Boys Wtf why have you scared everyone away?<br /><br />Hey pool boy thanks for the advice, unfortunately I taught the plebs too well that if they leave the work someone will eventually do it. I did it constantly to the original cunt lips. Going to hire some new blood to scare everyone, as they all live beyond their means and they like the $$ so I am going to do a high profile termination so everyone gets the point. Fucking had enough this week and all those cunts told me they will be at this pub when I arrived no one insight. I then get a sms saying... Hi this is mark from rent a friend. We are sorry to inform you you booking has fallen through, our beat advice is to head home immediately, before someone points and laughs.<br /><br />Fucking pricks that&#039;s my trademark message amd the cunts have used it on me.

				yeah the reviews are good, some saying it&#039;s better than Tony&#039;s and Tony&#039;s got rave reviews. he&#039;s got some afghan brown H and some Asian #4. his #4 half g&#039;s are the same price as a quarter g i got from Nucleo. not really interested in the brown, which is about £15-£20 cheaper for half g - ALL about the quality with me :) bit of a snob really. at the same time if it is proper #4 a matchhead&#039;s worth does me 3 or 4 hours, which means half g&#039;s gonna do me a good 4 months at least - i only do it on weekends, and not every weekend at that - heard H is just a little bit habit-forming ;)

Only ordered a half for now. Figured I&#039;m more likely to just get a love letter with that amount. Ordered from anarcho, and the reviews on his packaging are pretty stellar, so I&#039;m fairly confident in that getting through. We&#039;ll see!<br /><br />Also found a local dealer on here, so ordered a small amount from him to gauge quality. Would definitely rather buy weed locally. Amusingly, he is the only vendor of anything at all in this country.

				Your acetone is definitely anhydrous? That is vital or you will dissolve your cocaine as well as the cut.<br />Ordinary coffee filter paper will be fine for this, try and get bleached ones if you can and make sure to wet them with acetone just before you pour your wash in.

				i&#039;ve only done meth once, cracked my head on a sink and it was gushing with blood so i was told. can&#039;t remember doing it though. i&#039;ll stay the fuck away from that from now on though - i get paranoid after smoking too much pot now, think it&#039;s coke and pot in bloodstream at the same time, so i really don&#039;t need a proper chemical paranoia kicking in

My associate at xxxxx will need to be informed of the shit poor service you have provided.<br /><br />There is no sarcasm or humour in this email, so please don&#039;t confuse this as &quot;kind&quot;.<br /><br />When I express your urgent attention is required, that should not be taken as relax I am fine with your company to drag your dam feet!<br /><br />I have got a good mind to fly xxxxx over to &quot;put a rocket up your arse so you and your company can get their shit together&quot;!!<br /><br />Thinking about it we shall both fly over just so we can, <br />1. Express our clear disgust at your service. <br />2. As discussed rip you a new arse hole. <br />3. Make you buy us dinner. <br />And last but certainly not least (this list could very well grow greatly) 4. Not only take the xxxxx we ordered. BUT expect double the money we paid for the irritation and sleepless nights YOU have caused to me, xxxxx, our Families and friends!<br /><br />I have taken no enjoyment in writing this email and I hope you now understand the pain and suffering you have now caused!<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br /><br />Xxxxxx

				yeah good man, i lost about 20% in the wash. it&#039;s not perfect, it doesn&#039;t smell but it still has a little bit of that coke taste, so tetravort must perform another step or 2 to get his gear THAT clean, but you can tell it&#039;s a lot cleaner when you do a line. lot easier on the nose as well, doesn&#039;t clog up half as much. didn&#039;t get the bulging eyeballs or the chin wobble so it definitely washed out whatever causes that - think that must be something in the manufacturing process causes that. pretty chuffed to be honest, i&#039;ll be doing it more often. just wondering how much i&#039;ll have left when i wash some of Daves.<br /><br />didn&#039;t get nowt in 420, spent all my dollar the week before - needed to get the coke sorted before this wednesday as some shits going down here then.<br /><br />wot u get?

				i don&#039;t get depressed after doing H, but i do tend to chuck my guts up the day after if i do more than 3 bumps in a session. and to answer your q in the H vendors thread - Noriegas #4 is pretty good. not as potent as Nucleos was, but a bump the size of a coupla matchheads does the job pretty well.<br /><br />just posted this in the coke vendors thread, but thought i&#039;d post here as well cos i really don&#039;t know what to do about it:<br /><br />i ordered half g of this 98% coke from Noriega on Friday and a delivery turned up yesterday (Monday), so that is bloody quick postage from NL to UK by anyones standards. my mrs knew i was expecting this one (she&#039;s now ok with me ordering half g&#039;s, and she&#039;s actually looking forward to trying some 98% cocaine - think that lab test finally swung her round to giving the gear another go :) ) so opened it up in front of her all excited, only to find..... half a gram of #3 smack! GUTTED!!! if my mrs didn&#039;t see it i would have just stashed it away and left it at that, but this is OUR first delivery from SR (as opposed to mine) only to be what she sees as a monumental cock-up. i msg&#039;d Noriega about it last night but i&#039;m pretty fucked as to know what to do now - obviously i can&#039;t send it back. still waiting on a reply.<br /><br />what would you guys do in this situation? Noriega hasn&#039;t got back to me yet, but as i said there&#039;s no way he&#039;s gonna tell me to send it back, so i&#039;m gonna have to flush the H cos the mrs will KICK MY ARSE if i keep it or i tell her &#039;it&#039;s ok, i&#039;ve done this shit before, it&#039;s fucking all right!&#039;. obviously i also couldn&#039;t tell her &#039;oh yeah, it&#039;s def #3 heroin, cos the #4 i got stashed upstairs is a lot whiter than this&#039;. in fact she&#039;d more than likely leave me - you know what birds are like; &#039;oh my god, you&#039;ve done heroin, that means you&#039;re obviously addicted, it&#039;s all gonna go wrong, you&#039;re gonna lose your job, then the house then sell all we own, blah blah fucking blah, i&#039;ve seen trainspotting, they&#039;re all like that&#039;.<br /><br />i&#039;m not bad mouthing Noriega as i know it&#039;s obviously a genuine mistake, with 420 he must have been inundated with orders and fucked up on the address labels, but would you leave a 5 if this happened to you?<br />so pretty pissed off....probably not as pissed off as the guy who&#039;s jonesing for the heroin is going to be when my coke turns up in his mailbox, but FUCK SAKE.<br /><br />i suppose all i can do is wait to see what Noriega says....

				Raoul,<br />Did you do your wash with straight up acetone or did you dry it first? Tempted to give it a go next pick up. How long did it take and how much smell was there, I need to keep it on the d-low from the trouble and strife.

				yeah good thinking shiz, i think it&#039;ll be a mix of something with a bit of flour in there, there are white specks in it. fuck knows what i&#039;m gonna do to disguise the smell though.<br /><br />cache: i washed straight up with the acetone, i chucked a lines worth in at first and stirred it for a good few minutes, then filtered that bit and it didn&#039;t look as if i lost any, so i chucked the lot in a clean beaker with acetone.<br /><br />acetone fucking stinks by the way, hums to high heaven of nail varnish remover, if you&#039;re gonna do it wait for her to fuck off out for a few hours - the wash itself doesn&#039;t take that long, but then you need to ventilate the room for a couple of hours to get the smell out.<br /><br />the link i sent you on PM the other day is the real deal - that is definitely pure acetone. but don&#039;t get it off amazon, google the manufacturer and go to their site - it&#039;s cheaper. not that its expensive anyway, but a quids a quid at the end of the day

It&#039;s quite subtle though, and takes time to build into a speedy high.. Lasts too long for my liking though, I ended up binging and staying up for around 5 days! Work is not fun when you&#039;ve been awake that long (I&#039;ve been getting mad paranoia too! I&#039;ve been enjoying c63&#039;s freebase.. Now that&#039;s worth a smoke!- Only lasts for 30min to 1hr... Much more manageable!!

				No.. Not anymore... Quit smoking fags about 3 years back.. Weed went with it, I&#039;ve been cooking with it though! Got my cannabutter technique down! Still managed to pull a whitey on Sat night though.. You have to be careful when eating to not eat too much!!

				Nope.. Is defo the Meth I&#039;m afraid.. I&#039;ve only really been baking since the paranoia incident! On a chill out tip at the moment!! I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be long before I want to get my velocity increased though ;)<br />Giving my brain a break from stims (Amphet and meth!).. I&#039;ve got a coke weekend lined up in a few weeks! <br />I&#039;d say give meth a go though... don&#039;t buy anymore than half a gram... You won&#039;t need it all. (Or it&#039;ll last all week!) and smoke it! Sniffing&#039;s a waste (Due to bioavailablity)

				Dusk how you doing mate. Snorting meth gave me a better high but maybe its the process I like. Definitely agree it is subtle which is probably the meh feeling I get. Wanting and waiting for the rush is why I don&#039;t get it, maybe too much anticipation. Hard to explain. Where as coke I can describe the fuck out of that white bitch&nbsp; ;D

				nah mate she chucked it, which is just as well really cos if i kept it, it probably would have been the end of my self control - was hard enough when i ran out of the #4, and now i&#039;m over the wds that&#039;s the end of my time with smack. still wanna try opium, so i&#039;m gonna give that a go next month probably, but i&#039;m not touching H any more. getting some ket and those triforce next week, not done ket in years so looking forward to that. can&#039;t beat a good E neither can you. probably the 1st month i&#039;ve not bought any coke, but i think i&#039;ve spent that many weekends on it my tolerance is through the roof - a fat line of MINs stuff that i washed didn&#039;t give me much of a buzz so i&#039;m gonna leave it alone for a bit.<br /><br />your previous post did make me laugh. i&#039;ve never seen mimes whenever i&#039;ve been to Nodnol, and i&#039;ve been there loads, had a good hookup for coke down in Camden before i found SR so i was down there once a week, usually ended up in the west end absolutely battered.

				yeah would NOT advise it DK, i thought 35mg would just be enough to let me know it&#039;s not bogus but FOOKIN hell. 1st bit of K i&#039;ve had in a few years so that&#039;s probably contributed to it pulling my pants down. looking forward to having a sesh on it now :)<br /><br />haha @opi - sounds like just where i wanna be right now this K&#039;s worn off

				Yeah I understand that part :P But you inhale something and it tastes like burned plastic and all that.. bleh. <br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, DMT has intrigued me for years already but I think it would be a waste of such great product if I coughed while the &#039;vaporized DMT&#039; is only halfway to my lungs, uknowwhaddaimsayin&#039;? ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking into these pharmayahuasca capsules from dimitri, they look interesting too but I see a lot of complains about people waiting extremely long on his delivery. <br /><br />Ahh.. now that I think about it, might just go for the DMT all along.. been on my mind for years.. ::)<br /><br />or anyone else have any great tips? :P

				Drone (Mephedrone). It was made as an mdma replacement but got banned quickly. IMO it feels A LOT different to mdma. Has some similarities, music appreciation, empathy but that&#039;s about it. The empathy isn&#039;t as strong as MDMA&#039;s its more a sense of &#039;you&#039;re amazing bro&#039;.<br /><br />Feels like Coke and Speed as well, its more stimulating than MDMA, you feel like fucking superman, confidence goes through the roof and you can talk and talk. (why do you think I keep posting today hehe)<br /><br />You can take it two ways, snort it or parachute it. If you snort it then 100mgs is enough, if you parachute it, 200--250mgs is enough. <br /><br />If you parachute it, it lasts about 2 hours, snort it and it lasts about 30-45 min. <br /><br />Unlike MDMA you can re-dose several times without losing the peak effects, when it wares of just do another line and your back where you started! My advice is to never order more than a gram, its fiendish.. and anything over a gram is too much.<br /><br />I got mine from Googleyed and its top drone.. good packaging as well. Lim is getting more in stock soon, I&#039;ve heard his is good but I&#039;ve never tried it myself

				Oh and as much as I hate to see it, the euphoria is more intense than MDMA&#039;s. mdma is a magic drug, nothing compares, but for the euphoria drone wins.

				You can easily extend the duration IMO. I find parachuting 250mgs, then doing tiny lines to keep the buzz going works. 50mg lines are enough to boost you back up to the peak! Do 250mgs parachuted, then 50mg lines - works like a charm IMO.

				I&#039;ve always wanted to try Meth. Trying something new + weight lose = win-win. I get addicted to things easily though, but I reckon low doses for appetite suppression will do the trick.

				Ephedrine is not really a something that you would buy to get high on... I&#039;ve snorted it, I&#039;ve gotta say it was the most painful thing I&#039;ve EVER snorted... Oh, I might add that I was 14 when I snorted it.. You can buy it in a UK chemist!!<br /><br />If you do decide to buy some... Go low... It&#039;s pretty moreish.. But subtle! Don&#039;t expect the &#039;smash&#039; that everyone talks about.. Well perhaps Hoff can tell you how to &#039;hot rail&#039; that&#039;ll give you a meth wollop apparently!

				I know mate, I don&#039;t want something to get high on, merely to lose weight. It&#039;s cheap as well, but in saying that so is speed. <br /><br />IMO Speed and Ephedrine are good for weight lifting, but not cardio. I assume because they both increase heart rate, cardio would suffer as suppose to improving.. Might be wrong, what do you think?

				Like as you know coke is my drug and meth to me was just a full on stim that keeps you awake. Hotrail that shit and it changes you perspective! I mean fark. Talk about euphoria. Best sex ever!!! Sorry sol. <br /><br />YouTube Hotrail meth if your interested. It is a mental addiction. A gram is good for probably a week so not too bad, but the weight does drop. Just make sure you keep drinking water even if your not thirsty, and brush your teeth. Disk can show you what happens if you don&#039;t ;)

				By cardio I mean treadmill, exercise bike etc... since the stims have already increase BP and heart rate I&#039;d assume you performance in that area suffer. But I&#039;d assume all the noradrenaline would increase strength. Could be wrong...<br /><br />IMO taking Speed or Ephedrine, or even Meth is safer than being fat for 30 years.<br /><br />Which sounds safer for the heart, 30 days of Stims or 30 years of being fat?<br /><br />

				I would definitely agree that Googleyed&#039;s Mephedrone is of very good quality; much better than the stuff you would get on the streets now.<br /><br />The weight has always been generous (being slightly over each time) and he has even been kind enough to include a little something extra which is excellent, and makes him shine as a true credit to SR :)<br /><br />So overall I would definitely recommend Googleyed to anyone who is thinking of buying from him.<br /><br />Stay safe!<br /><br />worldinyourhands

I love how with Drone and M1 you can take them after each other without losing the effects.

Normally go for MDMA but got 250mg myself 2 or 3 weeks ago and had a great time, only had 100mg but some mushrooms maybe 3 or 4 hours in. Not quite as euphoric as MDMA but close, and the dose seems lower (I normally drop about 150-200mg of MD in a night). Noticeably more psychedelic as well and a lot more eye wobbles, all round I probably enjoyed it more than my usual rolls.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds nice, I&#039;ll give it a go. I like psychedelics, so something with a psychedelic edge to it should be enjoyable. I have quite a high tolerance to MD and normally drop around 180-200mgs to get a decent roll.<br /><br />Oh yes shiznit I know that exact situation... I don&#039;t do Coke often though, too expensive. I stick to my Mephedrone - I love it. But Coke is one of them things I buy when I want to try treat myself&nbsp; ;D

				Thats how me and the misses treat the coke... Although we knew the coke we got from our local man was good.. We did not realise how good it was... It&#039;s only since I washed it last week that I really appreciated it.... It was a different high, cleaner, nicer! <br />So unless any SR vendors can step up in price, I think I&#039;ll be buying off him! <br />I&#039;m gonna give Meph a go I think...

The empathogen effects i remember were high also with the MDA. I&#039;m really excited to try it pure.

Pollen for £1000 a KG.(used to sell that) so that has gone up phenomenally but coke actually there is like a three tiered system for coke in UK now. Premium, Mid &amp; Low. The premium is like prices in the 80&#039;s-90&#039;s but as the coke got cheaper and less pure, it has now created a new surge of premium but you pay through the nose for it (pun intended!) though people will pay it coz the shit stuff is not even worth doing now. I think the same will happen to heroin in the UK now too....Its got worse n worse for years that now people would pay higher prices for premium gear....I&#039;ll wait to see what happens with that one but it would make sense right? based on the coke situation....like a correction of the market.

				Yeah, they&#039;re useful for stim comedowns, always pop 10mgs of Valium after a night out on Drone. Speaking of which, I&#039;m glad people are finally interested in it! <br /><br />My advice RD for drone is to rail 100-150mgs, should give you an intense rush. Pure euphoria... I love it, most euphoric stimulant I&#039;ve had. IT IS however fiendish... But I think that&#039;s the unwashed Drone. <br /><br />Lims drone is meant to be double acetone washed to take away the fiendish nature of the drug&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If you prefer to take things orally (Think I&#039;ve seen you post that you prefer taking MD orally rather than nasally) then bomb 250mgs in a rizla paper or tissue. You will be feeling king of the world&nbsp; :)

				That&#039;s weird, MDMA nasally hit me like a ton of bricks. I actually vomited from the drip though - disgusting. Prefer to take it orally for that reason,&nbsp; I wrap it in two rizlas to make sure sure the taste doesn&#039;t hit me. <br /><br />100mgs is a good starting dose yeah, especially if the Meph is decent. Then just do 50mg lines to keep the buzz going every 30 mins or so. Thing with Meph is that you can re-dose loads of times before you lose the peak effects. Every time you come down, 50mgs and boom your back up to where you were. It does string a little, but only the first line, once it kicks in the other lines don&#039;t sting much at all. The sting isn&#039;t that bad anyway, its no where near as bad as 2c-b... just a little sting that lasts 10 secs. With 2c-b your nose is hurting for fucking ages lol.<br /><br />Hope you have fun on it anyway man, its a fun drug. Rushy, euphoric, makes you talkative, people are amazing and your appreciation of music goes through the roof. <br /><br />Speaking of blowjobs, I haven&#039;t had one in months.

				Wondering what drugs to do this weekend!<br /><br />Also, think I better change the sheets on my bed.<br /><br />One more thing, I got a pal who is going to be vending here! <br /><br />I have tasted his wares for 25 years plus. Specialty is a &#039;go to guy&#039; for hash and bud when nobody else had any!<br /><br />Also he used to sell coke in the 80s. Not touched coke for 15 years as that drug was his Achilles Heel. His word is that the best coke in the UK is now just the few kilos people bring back. the bigger &#039;gangs&#039; who deal in weight cannot resist mixing the coke. All clevr coke users wash their coke these days and have since the 90s when things went downhill fast as more and more &#039;street gangs&#039; took to selling coke. The only way to make it cheap enough to sell in very poor areas is to obviously cut it down to hell. <br /><br />Many kids raised on UK street coke are clueless about drugs in general. In an era of information tecnology you would think all drug users would educate themselves on the drugs they use. We done this when teenagers. Searched for the books on growing cannabis. Books written by old hippies which were laughed at until you actually tasted the results. Made even the best foreign imported weed seem like moldy tasteless seedy third rate smoke.<br /><br />As for talking shit one of the guys on work is telling us how he dropped 120 mg of MDMA off SR and was dancing by the jukebox along with 5 other lads. Jumping up and down in a giant mass man hug. lol. A table full of glasses of coke and orange! The pub did not mind as we will be back full of speed and that shit makes you drink a lot! <br /><br />And you love talking shit on speed also!<br /><br />So I will come here when I test out some speed and say hello or fuck this world , depending on quality&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Good thread.<br /><br />Hey, I wonder is there a God?<br /><br />lol<br /><br />Laters<br />

Be just in time hopefully to take advantage of this meph business... What&#039;s the price difference between this stuff and Lim&#039;s usual meph? 10 bitcoins a lot o&#039; spends!!

				On another matter... Just picked around 30 Poppy heads &amp; stems (papaver somniferum) So got them drying! They grow on some wasteland a few miles away (noticed as I drove past the other day) I used a couple of heads to make a tea last year and was nicely wasted! - I may replant the seeds in a place of my choosing, so next year I can make some Laudanum (It&#039;s pretty easy to do a simple extraction from what I&#039;ve read!) - Can&#039;t be arsed to harvest opium though... Too risky/messy!!

				You should have a look around RD... You&#039;d be surprised how common they are, they&#039;re pretty much a weed... People will tell you that they&#039;re no good (You cant grow opium in this country blah blah) If that&#039;s the case, why are the government paying farmers to grow them as another cash crop!!! - They&#039;re real easy to spot once you get a good look at them...<br /><br />I love natures bounty... Next up, mushroom season!! I&#039;ve some great spots up here... They grow in their thousands!!

				When are you all getting Meph then? :P I&#039;ve got to go to my postal depot tomorrow morning to get my gram from Google... its ANNOYING, I was out when the postman delivered it.

				<br />Google&#039;s stuff is nice, rice grain crystals... railed 100mgs of it and it treated me nicely. Ended up polishing off the whole gram throughout the course of the day though, but that&#039;s Meph for you.<br />Did 100mgs, 30 mins later another 100, then decided to go full on and rail 200mgs an hour after that. Blew my face off I&#039;m telling ya. Unless you&#039;re experienced with Meph, like me stick to 100mg lines lol. Or if you want a really intense rush do 150mgs. <br /><br />Yeah I&#039;ve got a sample coming from him and 40BTC&#039;s in my account. If his Meph is the pre-ban that I remember I&#039;m defo ordering 2G&#039;s.

				What beer do you drink mate? My favourite is Budweiser! Followed by Stella. I do like a nice cold pint of Magners though, don&#039;t often drink cider but Magners is lovely.<br /><br />Yeah its not pre-ban Meph, but the quality is good. The pre-ban Meph as you said was was a sand like substance. I remember those pre-ban days... my mate gave me a bump on the end of a key and it blew my head off. Lovely lovely days.<br /><br />Sure, I&#039;ll be doing a full trip report on Lim&#039;s pre ban Meph when I get it. Hopefully Friday if he sends it off tomorrow&nbsp; ;D.

Did a 200mg line on Thursday though... that&#039;s what happens to me on Meph. I started out with doing 100mgs, 30 mins later another 100mgs. Then an hour later thought FUCK THIS and railed 200mgs, 100mg up each nostril. Telling you what mate, hit me like a ton of bricks.<br /><br />Yeah, I find it hard to stop moving too. I do find Meph relaxing in its own way. Gives me an overwhelming desire to listen to music! But I find myself going for a fag every 15 mins because I can&#039;t sit down any longer&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />Makes me horny too, but no girlfriend at the moment, so you know...

The pre-ban Meph as you said was was a sand like substance. I remember those pre-ban days... my mate gave me a bump on the end of a key and it blew my head off. Lovely lovely days.<br /><br />Sure, I&#039;ll be doing a full trip report on Lim&#039;s pre ban Meph when I get it. Hopefully Friday if he sends it off tomorrow&nbsp; ;D. Thing with Meph is, it makes me talk for fucking England. Expect this report to be a long read&nbsp; ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />haha yes mate! i talk forever on meph, i also physically can&#039;t stop moving, i&#039;ve tried everything but if theres any kind of beat i just can&#039;t help but move. Same with MDMA as well. I love it though :) -yes same here, i&#039;m hoping it comes friday because otherwise i don&#039;t think i can test it till monday. But oh well still looking forward to it to say the least, i&#039;ve missed the pre-ban shit&nbsp; :P<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Haha, hopefully we get it Friday! I can&#039;t wait, I&#039;m quite experienced with Meph, I know good quality when I feel it&nbsp; ;). Hopefully yours comes through on Friday as well! Let the whole of SR be on Mephhhhhhhhhh, loving the thought of that! Everyone on here railing lines of Meph.<br /><br />What doses do you do? Normally I do 100--150mg lines. Did a 200mg line on Thursday though... that&#039;s what happens to me on Meph. I started out with doing 100mgs, 30 mins later another 100mgs. Then an hour later thought FUCK THIS and railed 200mgs, 100mg up each nostril. Telling you what mate, hit me like a ton of bricks.<br /><br />Yeah, I find it hard to stop moving too. I do find Meph relaxing in its own way. Gives me an overwhelming desire to listen to music! But I find myself going for a fag every 15 mins because I can&#039;t sit down any longer&nbsp; ;D.<br /><br />Makes me horny too, but no girlfriend at the moment, so you know... I don&#039;t get the pleasure of having sex on Drone&nbsp; :(.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />i like to start of with a 100mg line, then go for around 50-75mg therefore after. Considering i&#039;m only 70kg&#039;s i&#039;m actually quite a light weight when it comes to things like meph which i consider a positive thing, and a 100mg line usually hits me pretty hard, god only knows what lim&#039;s stuff is gunna do to me haha! :)

				I just do small coke like lines of it....I really wanna get some old skool meph!! I never thought about acetone washing it but the stuff I get locally is not mephedrone anyway its that 4-MEC not 4-MMC and not as good. Also probably recrystallized with cuts as Lim suggested as it is way more shardy than the pre ban meph used to be....also doesn&#039;t have the classic smell of drone....the only thing about drone is that it makes me feel ruff as fuck the next day! if i aint got heroin, i aint havin a good sunday!! lol

				*discretely dropping into convo after lurking*<br /><br />Is there a reagent to distinguish between mephedrone and similar analogues, 4-MEC etc.?<br /><br />Thinking of getting a sizable amount from google, or lim when he gets a new batch up, but having last done it ages ago, pre-ban, I doubt I&#039;d be a good judge.

I even feel better the next day, I&#039;ve never had depression/fatigue from a drug comedown! Guess I&#039;m lucky.<br /><br />@ geedogg I love Budweiser, Stella, and Magners. Magners is the only cider I can drink, though Woodpecker isn&#039;t too bad either I guess. That sucks, I&#039;ve never had street &#039;Meph&#039; though.. wouldn&#039;t touch it. <br /><br />@geedogg, read my trip report for M1 mate. It&#039;s an awesome drug, has it&#039;s own magic... the feeling is great. I felt as if my soul had been wakened and I felt like a little child again. Got some more of that on order from Lim. <br /><br />Hate sounding like a prick, but dunno what the fuck iI&#039;ll do with the rest of my BTC. Might either go for Crystal Meth, then spend the rest on Meph. I don&#039;t do much MDMA nowadays, being me, I abused it too much. Was taking it every 2 weeks for ages. I&#039;ve lost the &#039;magic&#039; so to speak.<br /><br />@cryLOTT, yes you can, but its hard if you haven&#039;t tried proper Meph for ages. 4-MEC gives you a buzz, but not much euphoria or as much music appreciation as Meph does. If you want proper Meph, go to Lim HE HAS ORIGINAL PRE BAN SAND GRAIN MEPH. It&#039;s pricey, but will bring back memories. Google&#039;s product is a banger too, rice grain crystal, obviously not as good as Lim&#039;s pre-ban but it&#039;s proper good quality Meph.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I guess a good way of discerning meph from some analogues is by trying to get the analogues and having a toot of both.<br /><br />Afraid I can&#039;t get lims current meph, too high a price for me, as the meph will be for reselling to some friends, not personal use. Loads of people I know go crazy for it, more than before the ban. can&#039;t see the sense in it myself<br /><br />Although I liked meph, it was normally the first ~20 mins that was good, then I would just go fucking mental for the rest of the night, like on super high doses of mdma, and have proper amnesia the following day. Maybe that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />anyone know when Lim is getting his new batch in?

				A lot of people who have tried Meph, then try 4-MEC would agree how shit 4-MEC is. Meph is awesome. I understand where your coming from cryLOTT, I&#039;m never sensible with Meph. I can put most drugs down but with Meph, I&#039;ll burn through whatever I have. <br /><br />I find with Meph, you can re-dose a lot without losing the peak effects.<br /><br />As for Lim he said the 20-25th&nbsp; :). If you&#039;re in a hurry try Google&#039;s, its nice stuff. Not like pre-ban obviously because its rice grain crystals, but is certainly decent quality.

				It wasn&#039;t so much the urge to redose, although it always happened. It&#039;s that there didn&#039;t seem to be a natural closure to the whole experience, when you feel like it was drawing to a close, like with mandy, the redose is never as good, and soon you&#039;re heading home.

Me and Lim constantly talk about it to people on threads like &#039;What drug should I try next&#039; We&#039;ve encouraged a few people to try it lol. <br /><br />As you lot know, Meph is great. When people who have never tried it, try it, they&#039;ll know why we all like it.

				@ geedogg, yes mate try M1. Soll highly advises you indulge in this, brilliant drug.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />@CryLOTT, I&#039;m not sure mate, I couldn&#039;t stop the nausea from the come-up. How did you take it? I snorted it once, spent 10 mins with my eyes watering with the pain, whilst nearly puking my guts out from the come-up. It passed though and I was tripping balls...Haven&#039;t done it since though, I think the 2c-b nausea is inevitable, just part of the come up. Once it&#039;s gone, its a nice experience isn&#039;t it? A harsh come up is a sign that something big is coming IMO, makes me a little exited despite the nausea.<br /><br />@ knomo, yes he is one of my favourite actors too. Go ahead, relax and enjoy the film brother!&nbsp; 8)

				I&#039;ve only ever taken it orally, in a gelatin capsule. The first time I was vomiting shortly after ingestion.<br /><br />I had a few joints once which helped a bit, but I now know to only smoke before, then come up once baked. Actually smoking while nauseous doesn&#039;t agree with me.<br /><br />But yeah, of course, once the nausea goes, the trip is amazing without fail. Those little magnetic neo-ball things seem to hold the truth of the universe while I&#039;m tripping. :p

				Yes, it&#039;s a nice little drug isn&#039;t it&nbsp; :P. Haven&#039;t done it much though, I stick to M1, Mephedrone, sometimes speed and MDMA. Though MDMA has lost its magic a little. If weed helps with the nausea, then go for it! Personally I don&#039;t like weed, strictly stims myself&nbsp; :) I like psychedelics too, but mostly stims for me tah.

				Yeah, same.. better to buy a gram IMO.. plus samples are always small, can&#039;t be doing with that! Lim offered me 250mgs of his pre-ban drone though, I couldn&#039;t resist the offer! I did order a gram of his M1 though, so will be doing the combo. Gonna do 100mgs of each train tracked! Time to touch heaven&nbsp; ;)

				I only do H as I was an addict since I was 17 until a few years ago....I just use once or twice a month now but it is true what RD said...It&#039;s amazing how it creeps up on you so if you have tendencies to do drugs quite a bit, it takes a lot of fucking will power and self control to keep it at arms length.<br /><br />Cloud Surfer is the one guys I reckon!! Gettin some ammonia in and fresh batch of acetone for the end of the month....never done an ammonia cook before, only bicarb. looks easy enough? anyone done it?<br />

				I&#039;m still a waiting on cloudsurfer but UK post is slow right now.<br /><br />As for talking shit one of the guys in work was saying how some hooker &#039;really did come&#039; when he went to Holland on a stag night, Vein bastard! He really thinks that! <br /><br />But I guess their is more chance of a hooker coming than of getting some good coke in the UK right now - SR aside!<br /><br />I go some washed UK coke - but its yellow and looks like it might not be coke! Any other coke from SR if i had it washed I think I would rail it right now - or - wait - tomorrow instead as its almost midnight and my women works away. I hate having UK washed coke. Even washed you still worry about it! <br /><br />We got 120mg or so or 140mg from might have been 1.8 grams. We got&nbsp; few washes as we persuaded the guys in work to wash their coke. So I get the job until I teach them how to do it.<br /><br />Speaking of UK coke I see some of pureogkush UK coke at 5.90 BTC. You would need maybe even ten grams to get a gram of coke off UK coke! I am not saying that of pureogkush coke as that might be worth it IF its at least 25% coke and you wash it.&nbsp; I washed sesampinos coke and got 90% back. that was not the expensive fish-scale he had. Never washed that one. Too special! <br /><br />I am tempted to get the pureogkush coke as he is a vendor I use and does sell some genuine stuff. <br /><br />And Pepsi or Coke - what do you think on that shit? Same company doing both laughing at us?<br /><br />Keep talking shit guys and girls. Why change the habit of a lifetime&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Or as the Americans say &quot;Sheeeeeiiiit&quot;

				Mine hasn&#039;t come either, just a bill. PISSED OFF. Was looking forward to trying Lim&#039;s pre ban stuff.<br /><br />@moksha, yeah they are, Drone is better snorted. Start with 100mgs then do 50mg top ups every 20-30 min. Or if you want to parachute it, the dose is between 200-300mgs... I suggest 250mgs for a nice strong buzz!<br /><br />Yep, do the Molly and M1 first though, leave Drone till last. If you do Drone before MDMA, you won&#039;t get much of a buzz from the MD! That&#039;s in my experience anyway.

Once went in to school stoned, didn&#039;t go in till lunch time, been doing a session all morning. 5th period I got pulled out of class because I wasn&#039;t wearing my tie (yeah we had to wear blazers, a shirt and tie in our school) and I couldn&#039;t stop laughing. Gave me the giggles badly, was just laughing my bollocks off whilst getting bollocked, got sent to the head of department and was put in isolation for it! Just chilled in that room all daaaaaay.<br /><br />Damn I miss school, pure banter with the teachers. I&#039;m 21 now and still haven&#039;t fully matured&nbsp; ::)

				&quot;SUPER SPEED, SUPER STRONG (1G)&quot; Has amphetamine there, but not much... I&#039;m assuming its shitty street speed cut with M1. Because I&#039;m now (after consuming 1.5G&#039;s) feeling music appreciation and the M1 head space. Normally I can&#039;t do much speed, but I&#039;ve burnt through this... defo has M1 added.

				I probably do speed every two weeks or so. However I do Meph quite a lot, been doing M1 quite a bit as well. I generally do Stims all the time. Maybe there&#039;s a cross tolerance? I do Coke very rarely, too expensive, plus I prefer Meph anyway. It definitely wasn&#039;t good Speed, I had two grams of the shit throughout the day.<br /><br />I&#039;m feeling shitty now, pretty fatigued and I can&#039;t stop smoking cigarettes, I smoke a lot as it is, but Speed always makes me crave nicotine more.

				Breaking Bad is my favourite TV show....Can&#039;t wait for season 5 to start soon!! Not seen Suits.<br /><br />Well what a hectic weekend that has been!!! Started watching the football on Friday, got pissed, smoked some bongs, went home took some 2C-B, loads of people turned up at mine and a party ensued, got a ball of coke for some mates which I happily helped them polish off and took some more 2C-B insufflated. Tripped my nuts off and tried to deal with all the madness of the party....fuckin hard work!!!! Yesterday started drinking again as there was 3 bottles of vodka left from the party!! (that never happens!!) Started hitting the crystal meth and that really perked us up as we were flagging at this point and waiting on my &#039;Dave&#039; to bring some more coke for us.....got another ball and just ploughed through that till about 7 or 8 this morning....crystal wore off so took a temazepam, smoked a few bongs in quick succession then went off to bed.....<br />Feel surprisingly fine today!!!!! Good job as it&#039;s my sisters birthday meal tonight so i&#039;m really glad i got some sleep!!!

Only problem is she was the main character in a film called &#039;The Eye&#039;, watched it thinking &#039;Fucking yes!&#039; because she was in it, but damn, it scared the shit outta me! The only film I can say has ever frightened me.

From who is there, I&#039;d go either Crystall Wife, Prof Twak or possibly BigSkyMeds but the first two are certified good vendors, though Prof&#039;s customer service has been moaned about, answering PM&#039;s etc but he does tell you that opn his page!! good stuff tho n good prices. Crystall Wife is in EU and people like the gear. You wanna get a pipe tho bruv IMO, I much preferred smoking it than snorting. u can get one off SR too.

				It&#039;s a bit too nice... Takes a couple of weeks of everyday use to get a habit, Duke&#039;ll tell you.. He&#039;s first hand experience, I&#039;ve always been a bit partial to painkillers, I had a bad shoulder injury when I was 16 and was prescribed Morphine.

I started too young and was naive, I had heard all the bullshit aboutdrugs and found out that it wasnt true so i thought, why wpould heroin be any different?? im smart, i wont get hooked!!! fuckin 15 yrs later im still doin it and i only just got out of full time addiction 2-3 yts ago!!!<br />If you like to take drugs at least once a day or evry other day....be VERY careful if you choose to try H. It is the one drug that the stories dont lie about!!!<br />That said, I so know people who use once a month or every couple of weeks so it can be done, i just have an addictive personality.

				but i tried it and got away from it before it got too serious, so it&#039;s do-able. still in the same mindset - not getting any more. just can&#039;t leave it alone if i do have it.<br /><br />still giving opium a go though, when that fucker starts doing single grams again - i think if i bought 5g (his smallest listing) that would be enough to give me a serious dependency &gt;:(

				Agreed Duke... I just got a little order happy of late! I know I&#039;m being a bit daft too... That&#039;s why I&#039;m reining myself in, I know my limits like geedogg!

				Alright pretty heavy story, I&#039;ll never try it because I think I&#039;ll like it too much.. <br />A friend of mine recently quit with his Lorazepam which he used for a good half year/year and really gave him a bad withdrawal and I don&#039;t want anything like that at all <br />Tho the doctor prescribed him Valium instead which should give the same situation in about a year ::)

				Just out of interest....how would you go about getting hold of pebbles as that OPI guy doesn&#039;t send outside continental US/CAN. I&#039;ve always wondered about people biggin up a vendors shit but they&#039;re from the EU n the vendor in question says they dont ship outside US/CAN?? Re-shippers? That&#039;s very trusting isn&#039;t it!? haha <br /><br />Yeah sorry missed what you were asking Knomo dude!! Its like a dreamy state, things are heavy, you cant keep ya eyes open and as RD said...&#039;whatever&#039; all ur cares go away and it is very moreish!! u end up not using all ur bag, so next day, you have a bit more, then u quite likes that so u get a little more in a couple of days...before you know it you have used 5 days in 7 as it is a fucking nice drug!!!<br />It brings you down nicely off ANY stimulant when its time to go to bed after a mad one....i fuckin love it....but also i have to respect it.<br />&nbsp;all the people that go to hospital n go on bout &#039;&#039;morphine is so great!! i was cranking that magic morphine button to fuck!!&#039;&#039; in the UK they use Heroin in hospitals...diacetylmorphine is heroin and this is the &#039;morphine&#039; you get administered. of course they would never tell this to the patients as they would freak out but its amazing when you take away the stereotypes how people feel about substances.<br /><br />oh plus im goin cloud surfer i think for my coke later in month....expensive aint they tho at minute!! n there is a french vendor shipping grams of opium...it says its &#039;pharma quality opium&#039; so i think that may mean cooked, not raw. it says u can smoke it so i would hope so. might do another pod extraction next weekend....

				ah GD - i never got the pebbles, but reading the H vendors thread apparently they&#039;re comparable to Nucleos gear - my original order was from Nucleo, based in Thailand. that is some SERIOUSLY good gear. i can compare it to Noriegas #4 - if you were doing Nucleos gear you&#039;d only need a 1/4 size of bump compared to Noriegas. literally a matchhead size, whereas Noriegas were little lines. tiny little lines, but little lines none the less.<br /><br />fuck that was good shit. cost me 50 quid for a quarter g though, but it was worth it

If you don&#039;t want to go straight in at the deep end with the H, I&#039;d suggest a 10mg Morphine Sulphate tablet or a 15mg, That&#039;ll get you on the buzz, but not too hard, plus you can just buy one then, AfghanApothecary does them for a couple&nbsp; of bitcoins each, (Well worth a go I reckon) <br /><br />Your right geedogg, plus when we told her, she did not quite believe us..

				I&#039;d start with less than a quarter of that .2 - I&#039;d suggest a match head, if you&#039;ve milligram scales, around 10 to 20mg - You&#039;ve no tolerance so you have to be careful!

				Where is your thread RD? Better read it! I don&#039;t see it becoming a problem with me, I&#039;m mainly Stims. The crystal on the other hand, well who knows. What dose did you do moksha? I&#039;ll try my best to keep it as a one time thing, SR will help me ironically, I get nervous about international orders and keep them to the minimum... and since this is from Germany, I reckon I can stick to it once.<br /><br />Yeah its annoying that I won&#039;t get the rush, but it will give me a taste for it. Yeah, I have scales that will weigh out a 20mg dose&nbsp; 8). Will be snorting both the Meth/H to get a taste for them<br /><br />Done Speed enough times, not nervous about the Meth.. obvious meth is stronger but I&#039;ll be starting low, say 40mgs moksha?<br /><br />@RD, yes he has it, here you go http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/2baebc3409. <br /><br />It&#039;s a lot better, the drip isn&#039;t vile with pre ban, you get an intense need for fluid, its speedier, and its sand like crystals. Not shitty powder, or &#039;rice grain&#039; crystal. Googles product was nice, was the &#039;rice grain&#039; crystal drone but he&#039;s stopped listing 1G&#039;s for some reason. <br /><br />Start of with 100mgs, straight up the shnozzer, you&#039;ll be feeling it pretty fast, then just do 50mg top ups every 20-30 min to keep the buzz going. <br /><br />

				Ergh, I just can&#039;t stand the taste of MDMA, for such a lovely chemical, it really doesn&#039;t taste nice. Smells nice though. Oh I hate the taste of Speed, use to it now though... Hate it when I&#039;m doing little dabs of Speed paste, my fingers smell for hours after dabbing it.

				Just edited it! Typed it all wrong, too tired. I meant to say &#039;For such a lovely chemical, it really doesn&#039;t taste nice&#039;. Na, with Speed if its base you have your fingers smell of it for ages from dabbing it, goes away the next day. Speed smells disgusting IMO. <br /><br />Oh and if you&#039;re snorting M1, 150mgs would be a good dose. 100mgs would make for an underwhelming experience IMO.

				Yeah man, all the fucking way. Gonna be a bit of a mad week for me, got some Crystal coming, some H, some Drone, some M1 and a half gram of MDMA. Buzzing for it... Yeah man I&#039;ll use the H after the Crystal, the Crystal should be with me either Wednesday or Thurs, Fri latest... Cos CrystalWife ships priority mail. The H might arrive first, will save some for the crystal come down though, got .2 of both coming! Lims high price for the pre ban is because of the fact its PRE BAN, not pre ban quality, sorta for people who did the pre ban like me, brings back old memories! Hopefully it arrives tomorrow, will be posting on here all day. Meph is the worst for making me chatty, even worse than speed. Yeah SR page isn&#039;t loading? It&#039;s just blank? Weird, no need to worry I think, should be back on soon hopefully! <br /><br />Hell yeah,&nbsp; an SR meeting in India would be amazing! I&#039;m smiling even thinking about it... we would go full on boys, days and nights of non stop partying!

				hey guys! RD i posted a link to some 99.9% pure acetone on this thread the other day. bout 6 quid for 1 litre. looks good, im buyin that one i think! <br />Soll, yeah i know its old stock n thats why people will pay the extra, i get that, but its the same formula in the compound so should be in theory the same buzz...<br />5-HTP is great stuff especially if ur goin 2 nights in a row as said it boost ur serotonin therefore u can get fucked again!! ;) but also good to help restore ur natural balance after yamming a shit load of toxic chems!! haha

				Wow is all I can say. Today the &#039;combo&#039; was Mephedrone + M1 + H. Well sort of a combo. I snorted 100mgs of drone and 100mgs of M1, felt fantastic. Then railed up a 150mg line of drone an hour later, and parachuted another 100mgs of M1.&nbsp; As I left the peak I stupidly (Yeah I&#039;m aware mixing Stims with Depressants is a bad idea) snorted 15mgs of H. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t wait any longer... And wow, I&#039;m feeling REALLY REALLY relaxed, and the funny thing is, the H hasn&#039;t taken away any of the effects of the M1/Drone, still got music appreciation and the euphoria. <br /><br />I&#039;d imagine this similar to a speedball (Coke and H) Minus the music appreciation.

				haha every time i read a post by an american or ozzy i say it in my mind with those accents....funny!!<br /><br />my top 10, in no particular order though as i love em all! though the one&#039;s at the top are the ones i do most frequently:<br /><br />THC/JWH-018<br />Coca-ethylene (coke &amp; alcohol)<br />Heroin<br />MDxx<br />2C&#039;s<br />LSD<br />Mephedrone<br />Crystal Meth<br />K/MXE<br />Nitrous Oxide<br /><br />I graded coke n alcohol together as coca-ethylene as really i prefer this to either of the 2 on their own.

(She don&#039;t like me smoking stuff!!) :D<br /><br />Geedogg.. I&#039;ve got .2 of some DMT, just been waiting for the right time to do it! (also I was thinking of the pipe!)<br /><br />Happy solstice guys, there was a nice gift of some Bing from High Supplies so just had a line and I&#039;m flying! So much for a lunch break!!&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty good stuff.. Think I had quite a large line!! (Maybe half!) - I&#039;ll do a write up later!<br /><br />Whoop!! :)

				yeah yeah! having worked in customer service and complaints teams if you have any issues with any company, just complain formally in writing or by phone and you should see results!!

				fairplay RD to be honest, Costello has made a right meal of that shit....and actually, I dont get why he has had refunds but it is not on his stats? if this is SR not adding them then whats to say, but if he has not added them to his signature on purpose? and why he gets full refunds when every other fucker gets what the vendor states on their profile before ordering? i dunno who the fuck to believe!? I think CS is offering half G&#039;s now too to prove to the skeptics if not wantin to pull trigga on full G.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll settle that for us if you do get some! :) 2.5g for £150 is good off Pfand.

				LOL fair play, then I shall give you this one as a freebie. :P<br /><br />When you make a drug there often several way to synthesize it, these paths are called &quot;Synthetic Routes&quot;. No no doubt that the Australian government has all the regular precursors for things like, let&#039;s say MDMA and Meph already banned which indeed they do so that rules out importing them to make the shit domestically because it will get stopped at customs. How do we get round this? Simple. You design new synthetic routes from unregulated precursors so that you can import/buy them (vast majority of the time you can buy everything domestically anyway) and make it from scratch from them instead. Boom. Beat the system. :D

				man all this talk of mephedrone is makin me wanna line! ha. Not had proper shit since the last day before the ban due to street meph not being meph, so I left it alone and went back to the classics &amp; other RC&#039;s. Yeah I guess you are kind of a guinea pig for trying new formulas, but I just try to make as educated an assessment as possible when looking into trying a new drug. In fact, a lot of drugs/formulas have already been produced but not popularized, like 2C-B for instance has been around since the 70&#039;s I believe?? I only heard of it not long back. <br /><br />haha I know what you mean fellaz about the birds....Not with a girl myself at the mo but man do they bleed you!!! lol Free drugs n sessions, money for this, money for that.....But fuck, I&#039;m fed up of one nighters or mad nutty women that I end up pulling but don&#039;t wanna have a relationship with. Some of my mates are proper pussy whipped though and I don&#039;t get how they live like that!?<br /><br />lol was hearing in my head an american accented &#039;wonky&#039; hahaha nice list Lim!!

				Haha speaking of shit Bing the other day my mate who sells it gave me half a G for me to have tested to see if it was actually what it said on the tin. Did a little line and knew instantly it had been chopped more time that a BDSM lovers ball sack. Got someone to run a proper test on it and it had less than 20% Bing and around 50% base and fuck knows what else in (I think it was lem). Baring in mind he sells this shit at £100 a g it sorta says alot about the U.K Bing market lol.

				No never. As I say because I see drug as just a commodity it just feels like you are bringing something that in my eyes shouldn&#039;t be part of that world into it so I never did drugs/dealt with them around any of my Ex&#039;s. Got pissed with her and went out clubbing and that with them but everything else was kept completely compartmentalized and hidden from view. <br /><br />Obviously I realize that not everyone subscribes to this outlook on it but it&#039;s not just a &quot;It&#039;s a Man&#039;s world&quot; thing, it&#039;s also because I don&#039;t want drugs to be involved in every aspect of my life because I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very healthy for you mentally. So yeah, in short it keeps me sane and gives me something to escape to when work is a stress.

				I think if it is your profession to peddle drugs, Lim has the right mindset I think. You don&#039;t usually work with your mrs at a regular job. Some do, but I wouldn&#039;t like it. Also the added extra of jail time.....<br />Recreationally, I think if they wana do drugs, I&#039;m happy to facilitate.....I love taking drugs, so it&#039;s great if they wanna have that same fun with me IMO.

I mean, 1mg gives you a mild trip and 2 is heavy... :P My scale is only good at ~10mg difference.. Too risky, them tabs were perfect.

				I use the buddy list as a way of keeping track who I like and who I don&#039;t. It let&#039;s me know who&#039;s online that I actually care about, and helps for when I go on my +karma streaks. I&#039;m trying my best to hand it out every 72 hours but my list keeps getting longer.<br /><br />I like to think of it as Mr. Danks most wanted list, as apparently anyone associated with me works for the government. :P

				Fucking hell Limitless! 3 days! Get some sleep bro!<br /><br />Anyhow just finished work. sat on my ass all night as the guys were fucked also and we decided to have a smoke and most end up not working when that happens!<br /><br />We all had a problem with wages - I&#039;m not bitching about it, we all have that shit, and we will get paid! We left the job half done and took the parts (worth more than we are owed) so no worry there but sucks when you get paid like that. <br /><br />I found a few joints of Afghan Gold Seal also. In my overall! Great find and saved it for the game tomorrow!<br /><br />One of the guys is bringing in a 44 inch TV - think its 44, its over 40&quot;. So we will plug that in and know we can get ITV on the indoor aerial we have. Some of the guys are going to the pub first, so some coke for them but I got to be the sober one on site. The front man! Stoned on hash I get this job! But fair play, ever seen someone on steroids and coke be polite to a boss? One of the guys we have is a body builder and has assaulted people for imagined injustices. Last year it was the manager of a take-a-way who got the order wrong. guy laughed on the phone so the beefhead drives ten mins and jumps over the counter. Lucky he took compensation and decided to drop charges. Amazing what a couple of grand will do to ease a bruised face.<br /><br />But what can you do? Known the guy for years. Plus we all know its silly to wind people up when you do not know them as there is always someone who will punch you eventually.<br /><br />So look forward to the game on Thurs night.<br /><br />I reckon Spain myself.<br /><br />Germany to win the final.<br /><br />England were shit as usual. <br /><br />Like our coke really. Looks promising but turns out to be a loser.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />

				WOW bare shit chatted last night! lol ;) Lim 3 days seshin.....professional mate! not done that since festivals last year.....<br /><br />Nah not seen Alice in wonderland trippin b4! have to give it a bash....<br /><br />Just woke up smoking a coupla bongs to set me up for a chillin morning! I wish I could get that wrecked on a school night like you lot! :( I need to change my job man! Oh well, football tonight, and we&#039;re halfway to the weekend....free party by us on friday! siicckkkkk&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Soll said he was a scouser and so I did search for OD in that area....he also said he was ~21 right? not found anything. thing is, we will prob never know due to anon nature...tho I know one of us at least has a very good idea of where he lives...I just hope it&#039;s something like he was gouched out with silk road open on PC and he got busted by people he lived with (parents maybe?).....long shot but no OD I could find on a quick search as they usually get reported in local press.....However, what was odd is the way I had said I&#039;d send him a tiny bump of crystal as he asked to buy it off me as I&#039;d said I didn&#039;t like it but I said he could have it free....I gave him my PGP and asked him to send me his along with his addy....this never happened. which I did find odd as he never mentioned it again and he was very keen to get it?.....All I know is, I hope he took our advice and also was savvy enough to do his research on it though as he did it speedball style first time!?! I think he jumped in the deep end to be honest..... :( I couldn&#039;t believe what I was hearing when he was telling us what he had done....like i&#039;ve said, fingers crossed still.....&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />RD I feel you on the pay ion one hand, out the other thing....sucks but you gotta have a treat still right??<br /><br />

				That&#039;s pretty mad geedogg... I did the same when I got to work this morning. A week is enough time to for local press to report on something like that... I&#039;m pretty concerned, I was also quite surprised he did what he did from the off!! <br />I&#039;ve been off the H now for a week... Feel much better... Went a bit daft (Spent up all my wages last month!)<br />I&#039;m also pretty skint this month, and the misses has planned trips and visits for us (So I also need to scale back on what I was gonna buy!)<br /><br />Still getting the Bing though!! - Not payday for me till Friday though....

				yeah i got concerned when he said he did 25mg of that H - #3&#039;s not supposed to be as strong as #4 is it? i fucking hope not because 25mg of #4 would put me into a coma. did Sol say he was a scouser? i knew he said he supported Liverpool but i thought all actual scousers supported Everton - it&#039;s like in Manchester ain&#039;t it - all the mancs support City, and all the Man U fans live at least 300 miles away. or Japan<br /><br />yeah i got me a treat coming, pfands finest :)&nbsp; due to my lack of fundage this month i&#039;m not risking Cloud Surfer, so i&#039;ll have to give him a go next month - you can imagine it can&#039;t you, spent your last bit of cash of fucking talcum powder.<br /><br />sweet dreams Gary Mutha-Fucking Oak ;)

				I am feeling good as me and the missus are off for a weekend of fun and frivolity.<br />&nbsp;<br />I got some coke off one of the guys to wash and it turns out to be 40% loss - 20% or so was a waxy yellow shit that I got from sesampinos coke. <br /><br />A few of the lads used, they looked like it was good gear and even the boss took a line and said he would get some if we washed it.<br /><br />I got given a &#039;little sniff&#039;&#039; for washing, turns out to be just under 500mg so Mrs Red is happy.<br /><br />I am spoilt for choice, but may settle for beer and weed only. <br /><br />As for AA - I got a bad coke off him, bad speed, plus valium that kept you awake ::)<br /><br />Got an E also - a &#039;real E&#039;. Pill reports backs it up as being legit but I prefer crystal and thank SR for that as it was not easy to get in my remote neck of the woods.<br /><br />Got some Modafinil, might be handy for some conference I got to go to on safety. <br /><br />Who saw the game tonight? Spain looked ordinary until ET then they showed flair.<br /><br />England are shit.<br /><br />Germany I would say will win this but we will see.<br /><br />Oh, I will take some MDMA with me as we got some club Mrs Red wants to visit. Her on coke, me on E, lol - could be interesting.<br /><br />Hello to anyone out there. <br /><br />And is the &#039;fucking awesome shit&#039; really good? (the coke off Sugar Daddy Mr P - I joke)<br /><br />He done the right thing and refunded all who bought the sugar. Well, at least anyone with 50 grams has enough sugar to cook exactly 16 fairy cakes.<br /><br />Thought for a horrible moment he had turned scammer!<br /><br />Good to see honest vendors with good coke!<br /><br />I am getting the Christmas coke in WAY in advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />Anything else is covered.

				meh, does anyone how long you need to go on break from cannabis for until its completely removed and from your body and your body/mind &#039;refreshed&#039; back to normal?<br />I have decided to go on a small break starting from after this weekend, for about 3/4 weeks not smoking it. I&#039;m starting to get pretty bad anxiety about things and i believe the cannabis is causing it, i smoke 4/5times a week. <br />has anyone else experienced this? I mean, cannabis might not be to blame, it could just be my current life circumstances causing it but i believe cannabis has some sort of role in causing it.&nbsp; :-[

I tried to get MDA before but it went tits-vertical so I am just waiting for things to occur really.<br /><br />Haha M1 is ok, I prefer MBDB (the real MBDB and not the shitty beta-ketone version lol).

I have a freebase pipe so I&#039;ll be good to vape it but you only use minute amounts of JWH, like 5mg. You can&#039;t really eyeball that shit so get good 0.001g scales if you ever try this compound!! MXE hit me like a ton of wonky bricks!!!! :) What is a suitable, not too heavy dose of MXE??

Once he got a few addresses he attempted to blackmail them for $150 by threatening to release their identities. Basically the gist was, if they informed anyone else or didn&#039;t pay he&#039;d spam the forums with it. Well, he spammed two separate identities in each category while no mods were online and made a huge ass of himself. Luckily it was all cleaned up in around 20 or so minutes I&#039;d say.<br /><br />Oh and I think someone might of hacked his account or something, I don&#039;t know this whole morning was pretty sketchy. ???<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lim&#039;s top tips of the day = Don&#039;t do Smack/If you do don&#039;t get samples off randomers.

				yeah it&#039;s like viagra but not as powerful as the blue pills - those blue pills give me a hard on so fucking hard it hurts. and you&#039;re stuck with it for hours.&nbsp; the jelly&#039;s like a gentle version, and if you concentrate you can actually get rid of your bone. until the wind blows anyway, than it&#039;s BOING again. it&#039;s good for when you&#039;ve done so many drugs your cock don&#039;t work ;) you can buy them online, just google kamagra

				yeah man that kamagra will sort you right out. you get different flavour jellies as well. they&#039;re all fucking horrible tasting but if i remember correctly the pineapple ones and banana ones are the best of the worst if you get what i mean. got through fucking loads of them when i was banging out coke, probably doing more than i was selling though ;)

				Lol, I just wrote the best fuck-off ever lol. It&#039;s in response to the first message I got sent -<br /><br />Dear Sir or Madam of the FBI/DEA/SOCA/HMRC/IRS or whatever other agency monitors this place. <br /><br />Although you have not formally requested it I am going to have to give you a tutorial in how to speak to me without raising my suspicions because I am afraid whatever training the U.S or U.K government has not served you very well. In fact when I see attempts like this (which I do fairly frequently) it makes me often wonder if the tax payers funds were intentionally wasted on you as some sort of interdepartmental joke or that the higher echelons of law enforcement really is incapable of finding any halfway talented investigators in the 21st century. If it is a case of the former, I am sorry to hear that you are the punch-line of the office joke, if it is the latter then I can certainly see why the U.S and U.K has a deficit at the moment and shame on you for exasperating the financial ills we are suffering today. <br /><br />I shall begin this lesson by asking you if you think I am particularly stupid? Given the fact I manage to deal drugs, launder money and other things that you would class as a crime under your very nose and get away with it I don&#039;t think sending me a message from an account that has absolutely no feedback with the tones and lexicon that you have decided to use is going to get you very far really? It dismays me that simply because you were most likely college educated and that you deem yourself to hold the moral ground that you think I would be some sort of stereotypically cretinous oaf that you might see being arrested in the street on a weekend. You need to A) work on your subtlety. B) work on your linguistics C) Stop trying to catch &quot;Criminals&quot; by reading a handbook. You will be much better off if you used the brain you were born with to think outside the box and find alternate solutions rather than rehashing the same ineffective tactics you seem to employ time and again. <br /><br />Finally, you may think that just because you find it extremely difficult to apprehend the members of SR that you can go for the financial jugular and catch us through these means and by trying to access my services you could learn how the laundering processes work and thus catch myself and others that use it red handed. You are mistaken here because you think I would be flippant about who I would take on as my clients, whilst I may work with those I can vet and be sure are trustworthy I shan&#039;t be considering working with any member of the Alphabet-Mafia and this stance will not change. <br /><br />Thank you for your clumsy attempt at trying to sting me, it was most humorous. <br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Limetless

				You should read this crazy article I found tonight :P<br /><br /><br />Lolquote:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So cocaine was systematically tested on soldiers? Yeah, by Theodor Aschenbrandt, a German scientist. In his 1883 report Die psychologische Wirkung und Bedeutung des Cocain he described how cocaine increased German soldiers&#039; stamina, and how it decreased their hunger and fear and that the stuff made them get worked up much easier. In short: it made them better soldiers. Right. After that, I found clear evidence of the Dutch Cocaine Factory selling cocaine to all parties during the war in a pharmaceutical weekly. Everybody from the British, the Germans, the French to the Canadians. There were many countries involved in that war and millions of soldiers from all over were fighting in the trenches. Neutral Netherlands supplied coke to all of those countries. This a bizarre fact and a dirty piece of Dutch history that was more or less covered up. It&#039;s not as if they teach this in school. Nope. The Netherlands made unbelievable amounts of money of trading during the war. They emerged from World War I as the richest country, together with the United States. But it&#039;s been kept out of the history books.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.vice.com/read/holland-was-the-worlds-biggest-coke-manufacturer<br /><br />

				Ok before I start I need to disclose I am high, but nothing I am about to say is untrue! (In my eyes anyway) <br />So blew work off today because I thought meh fucking bullshit o&#039;clock Skype call so fuck it. Fams away house to myself. <br />Sorry Lim there is no pornography attached to this story. ;)<br />Anyway nice day decide to sit outside with my 40oz (still in brown paper) life is good. Then without any notice I catch a glimpse on the other side of the road, this bright fluorescent yellow green flash. I immediately spring into action as I know it is my beloved postie who in recent times has not been giving me the &quot;attention&quot; I deserve, if you know what I mean! (Once again Lim there is no sexual innuendo or undertone) <br />I start walking toward the road ready to cross over when I notice, he has stopped delivering mail and his little legs are smashing those pedals like there is no tomorrow. The paranoid Hoffa quickly interjects and asserts &quot;he is avoiding you mate&quot; I dismiss this accusation on the account that I am high and potentially drunk. Besides I have always been nice to him. 6 pack for Xmas easter eggs even an out of the blue thank you. How can this be? My worst fear starts to unravel, he is avoiding me. I&#039;m not sure if it was his turning his head completely away, or the no response when I called out his name, but it became abundantly clear his legs was pumping like no lazy son bitch postie has ever done. Desperate, confused, hurt even. I don&#039;t know what came over me but involuntary movements started to occur. My hand reached down and grabbed a rock and at that very moment (with my hand on my heart) I heard the loudest snap I have ever heard. Little did I realize that snap occured in my brain. <br />Now I&#039;m not bragging but fuck I can throw a rock. I kid you not the rock has left my hand and with precision of a sushi chef has guided its way through the atmosphere and nailed this cunt fair and square on the back of his helmet. I cant tell you if it was planned, or luck I like to think of it as fate. Because all his peddling and ignoring added up to sweet fuck all right at that moment. Yes friends he wobbled for maybe a split second before the inevitable finally occured. Sideways he fell, not to the soft grassy side, rather the warm reality of black bitumen. Epic is the only reasonable word I can use to capture this once in a lifetime event. <br />So there it is Joe the postie lying on the road, most likely bleeding from the graze, and me frozen in a daze wondering why I make a choice to help him or to run away. <br />Everyone of my instincts told me he is human and you have to do the right thing. Why I was slowly walking backwards I cannot explain. But as every second passed, I found myself further and further away from the scene of carnage. <br />With what must have been his last gasp of air, he releases an almighty HOFFA. <br />Now I need to remind you that I am stoned and quite certainly drunk so again I am finding it hard to explain my thought processes. <br />After hear my name load and certainly clear, I then question if he mistakenly assumed I did the damage as he is clearly in a state of concussion. As it slowly dawns on me I have no other alternative but to start the long walk toward this poor fellow, erratic thoughts continue to infiltrate my head. Like what if I hit him again and knock him out and let someone else find him. Or fuck it he started this whole situation by yelling racial obscenities at me. Or and the one I am most ashamed of. I was pursuing him because he stole something from my house, what I don&#039;t know but to Christ I was going to plant it on him.<br />The moment of truth finally arrives and without opening my mouth to say a word, poor bleeding Joe whispers, Hoffa man I need your help, I look deep into his eyes and I swear for a quick moment I glimpsed into his sole and realized what only a person in my state could comprehend. Nice innocent Joe is also as stoned as a cunt! <br />I didn&#039;t know if I should laugh or cry but I heard myself yelling at him for being so irresponsible, and telling him that he could have killed someone. Random and sometimes incoherent jabber was coming out of my mouth, the adrenaline is being released, I am off the hook. I slowly started to calm myself when a warm feeling started to come over me and the realization started to appear, a moment of clarity even. I had to ask, Joe where have you been scoring your gear from. I looked him straight in the eye and even though no words were spoken, a lifetime of understanding was established. I knew and he knew he is a stealing cunt and that from this day onward he will personally ensure my mail always arrives. And given the fact I know and he knows I know and other &quot;lost&quot; letter should also come my way into the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Well there you have it friends my one day off was filled with so much emotion that I truely need to sob in a corner for what I have experienced has now confirmed to me the slow postie dudes are very very cunning until you choose to pick up your rock! I vote we all pick up rocks in protest as quite clearly these cunts are getting stoned on OUR coin!

				yeah i will be having a go with coke. hope i don&#039;t get the mustard powder either :-\ first time will be on it&#039;s own though, see what all the fuss is about. just nipped home to make sure mrs duke doesn&#039;t see any packages she shouldn&#039;t. she knows i&#039;ve got some coke coming but thats it apparently ;) TBH only had a quick look - it looks the same sort of texture as 2C-B but not as shiny. so 100mg will do the job then?

Yeah if you pour it out on a black shiny surface and look close you see little diamonds. Really pretty crystals. :D<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you already know this but I&#039;ll say it anyway, don&#039;t smoke it or IV it. It&#039;s not how it should be done. Best ROA is snorting it, bombing it isn&#039;t the best IMO. <br /><br />When you do it make sure ya got time for yaself because once you pop you wont stop. Shit&#039;s like Pringles.

				Lol I don&#039;t have weight over any vendor mate. If the stuff is shit then, I dunno, I might ask Dutchaan if he minds me buying from him. However whether he allows that or not is another story. He is fairly strict on treating everyone the same <br /><br />I&#039;m still hoping that the delay in shipping or whatever means that the decent stuff has been shipped but we will just have to wait and see.

				Also, you know for a fact that someone is bat-shit crazy if they let go of the chance of nailing the Dawson&#039;s Creeky pussy that Katie Holmes has between her legs.

				Jokes on you fuckers, I&#039;ve been keeping him in my basement for the last two weeks. He&#039;s been living off nothing but rice, mealworms, and his own excrement while I&#039;ve been forcing heroin and meth into his bloodstream until I decide to release him into the wild to hunt him like in The Most Dangerous Game. The meth will give him an advantage at first, but it&#039;ll be interesting to see how he copes with the withdrawal. &gt;:D

				Welll......I just hit two small lines....the bag smelt of coke not mustard but my sense of smell is a little fucked anyway. It is slightly oily and was stuck into lumps as was vacced with glistening sparkles and looked like the pic i&#039;d seen. I don&#039;t have a racing heart rate and got a slow numbing and now back of throat is nicely numb from the drip....weighed 0.98g with some powder on the surface of inside the bag, so prob JUST on the nail.... <br /><br />There is no-one here to chat shit to but I&#039;m feeling quite happy typing away at 100 miles an hour so I think I&#039;d be quite chatty about now!!!<br /><br />I think I&#039;m happy with this man!!!! The trouble is though, that I have been a bit greedy this week since friday and have sniffed a few lines of local shit each night since!! fiendish I kno but hey!! its me!! lol &gt;:D I don&#039;t normally do that but have just had a bit knocking about here.....Maybe not a massive euphoria, but i&#039;m at home on my own so nothin much to bounce off anyway but I&#039;m pretty sure it aint speedy!!! oh fogot to say...no clenchy jaw either.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you fellaz will receive yours tomorrow if I got mine today....RD, you ordered 2 days before me I think too!! I&#039;ll be washing this stuff before the weekend....gonna wash a gram...half pfands and half cloud surfers. I&#039;m really looking forward to CS now as I think its gonna be the one and i&#039;m not disappointed by Pfands either! Must of got lucky on the good batch!!! :)<br /><br />sorry was a while posting but wanted to be sure before I posted....will have another in a bit just to clarify the situation! hehe<br /><br />Anyone else about??? No mustard gas here Knomo dude! hey have you bought any good acid off anyone here? i was waiting for 3jane to get back online but was wondering about flying dutchman....or supertrips? Also getting some MXE off Lim and wondered how much to use in a bump? I dont like K-Holing too much so would like to avoid it if possible!!

				The salts don&#039;t stay hot for long... They turn from a crystal to a powder in the oven, your just trying to take the moisture out, so medium oven for a couple of hours.. Keep moving it about every 20 min or so (I&#039;ve burnt it before!)<br /><br />Works a treat!

Hence increasing things like euphoria and well being. People have reported using this technique with MDMA. But its very important to stop taking the 5HTP around 24hrs before you take the substance, otherwise it may negatively interfere with the effects. But this is just a guess, there isn&#039;t much information on it, but i will try it on Sunday and feedback :)

Although drinking a few beers when racking up the lines adds to the buzz quite nicely, even if you drink 3/4 beers the hangover feels like you&#039;ve drunk your way through your local pub. Totally worth it though&nbsp; 8)

				@knomo - it would NOT have been hilarious if it was mustard powder, I would have been royally pissed off. <br /><br />It&#039;s give me a power gurn this gear, only had a coupla lines and my chin is all over the place. Just&nbsp; washed 0.65 and it looks like most of its still there. Turns out the acetone was pure, or near enough anyway. Tested a lines worth and it pretty much all came back so I chucked the rest in. not got the patience for the Epsom salt thing tonight<br /><br />I&#039;ll let you know what I get back when it&#039;s dried out. Overall I&#039;m one happy bunny :)<br /><br />I&#039;ll stick a proper review in the coke thread when I&#039;m not too busy talking at people. My dogs already had my life story near enough, it&#039;s the fishes turn now :P

				Oh and it smells like nail-varnish. So whether or not that means it&#039;s been acetone washed or chopped full of base I dunno but it generally means one or t&#039;uther. Also, as far as the packaging goes IMO it&#039;s not the best method, the product is gets stuck on the side of the raised edge. IMO it should be in a zippy and then vac-sealed because zippies avoid the need there is now to scratch the surface of the vac-seal for hours on end. Ballache.

I mean yeah crack on with that (although personally I wouldn&#039;t ask for a sample off a vendor if he was running a group, I don&#039;t approve of vendors asking like that) but new guys? Fuck that riggggght off man. I mean I get sketched if I&#039;m ASKED for samples from people I dunno and always say no unless it was a vendor I may do business with in the future but that would be ONLY if I knew them well. I dunno if any of you remember when I first arrived on the Road (all of 3 months ago, seems like years lol!) but I did my samples as listings and I charged postage for them purposefully to look legit. I did do a thread on here as well but I made it clear nothing was totally free. <br /><br />IMO nothing in life comes for free so anyone that is new and offers samples for free on here I always jump straight to the &quot;Hmmm dunno about that&quot; stance straight away. This is especially for things like Heroin, Cocaine, MDMA, LSD and the ultra-hype drugs.

Just a user and a new one at that they wouldn&#039;t be fussed about. If they did go for just a forum member it&#039;d be a big face on the forum who buys from X-Vendor on the regs and try and get them to set up a meet with them because they&#039;d try and exploit any relationship they had built. I would be careful and clean house though if I were you, is all your tor shit on an encrypted flashdrive and do you use bridges and stuff like that?

That makes it exactly 80% not counting any Amphetamine it is cut with. I also doubt it&#039;s chopped with much Amph (if it is at all) because for one, I have done enough to feel it and I fucking HATE Amph and I wouldn&#039;t be feeling as good as I do and secondly you can tell when it is cut with Amph by the texture because it GENERALLY (of course, not always) it looks like it has ACTUAL glitter in it and it doesn&#039;t taste/feel Amphy either IMO. I would say if it does have Amph in it would be very low purity Amph and it would be only maybe 5-10% at the most. Saying that though it doesn&#039;t make sense fiscally to add Amph as a cut but at those small amounts. <br /><br />Anyway, that&#039;s my opinion, anyone else care to speculate?

Today I found that they do not check every street mailbox everyday, in other words, your letter can stay days totally stopped in the mailbox before the correios get the letter. Than, depending where you are, they ship to another city, than to another city (Brazil is a giant country), than to your country and just than to your city.<br /><br />It&#039;s not good for me too. Faster my customer get the stuff, faster I&#039;ll get the money, but I can&#039;t do anything about it and never lied about shipping time.

				Yeah it&#039;s nice. Proper fiendish ain&#039;t it, I&#039;ve probably got thru half gram already. Colours are enhanced, everything seems brighter. Wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m smashed but it&#039;s probably the coke keeping me in check. Have to try it on its own. If I can leave some... Smoking like a bastard again and had another 6 cans already

				I&#039;m pretty smashed mate as it goes. Just finished watching Wayne&#039;s world. Why are you just stuck with beer?<br /><br />Just weighed my remainder of meph - 0.54 :o<br /><br />It&#039;s pretty good if you do enough of it, the last couple of times b4 she went to bed I didn&#039;t even rack up, just stuck a straw in the bag on the sly when she was in the bog. She&#039;s in bed now do just racked a fat un, probably 70mg<br /><br />I know what you mean about it&#039;s not quite the Mandy magic. Don&#039;t get me wrong it&#039;s really nice but feels like you&#039;re sat there waiting for a big come up or something

				Don&#039;t feel too bad, it&#039;s not as bad as a pill comedown. Had the worst nights sleep though, sweating like a bastard and kept waking up. Did drink an obscene amount again though. Just gonna chuck some brekkie down me neck and do a line I reckon, that&#039;ll sort me out. Did over half a gram of that meph last night. Still, at least I managed to save some!<br /><br />Leave it alone for a bit now though, stick to the coke<br /><br />Haha GD - happens to the best of us, you should have washed it as soon as you got it. If I didn&#039;t I would have done the same thing.<br /><br />Yeah that mephs alright if you do enough of it.<br /><br />My nose is fucked from it though, dunno how I&#039;m gonna get any coke up it.

				Hahaha RD so what did you think overall? Giving Meph the nod or the shake of head? Curious and I like to get peoples honest opinions on the drug as a whole.<br /><br />As to feeling special the morning after, generally speaking, people either suffer on Meph or find it easy-peasy. I used to fluctuate depending on circumstance but now I only feel terrible if I march on past the 36-48 hour mark. A full 24 hour day bender is fuck all to me now. People generally get used to it and become accustomed to it. I been doing it since 2008 so it&#039;s fair to say I had a fair bit of time to adjust lol.....<br /><br />Oh and I am answering all messages now, got nearly 100 to do....ballache....

They are public and private keys, the seller give you his public key and you encrypt your address with it. With his private key he is able to decrypt it. You never gave out your private key. This is the same if you want him to send you encrypted message but you gave out your public key to him and he will then encrypt the message with it and you decrypt it with your private key.

				So basically, I save the private key from the vendor in my GPG keychain and write a message (using a textwriting program? Just any? ), encrypt it with his public key and send the encrypted message to him.. ?<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t sound too difficult.. :P

Got a looooot of festivals coming up. <br /><br />Also, was quite pissed off yesterday because of various things but today has been a gooood day.

				Lim cheers mate, feeling very good. Don&#039;t know why I don&#039;t do weed more often. <br /><br />I really hope it not what I think it is. Cheers for the update.<br /><br />Feltching is.... <br /><br />I am better with examples. So let&#039;s take trashy is having his way with that 15 year old Aussie. He goes the reach around and can&#039;t hold back anymore and blows his filthy load inside the young kid. Now trashy is thinking oh fuck evidence, he grabs a straw, pen, tube and sticks that bad boy up his 15 year old butt. He then wraps his mouth firmly around the end of the tube and with a slow steady Sucking motion sucks all his cum out. Sure there maybe traces of faeces, but that is the exception more than the rule. Now trashy being a paranoid guy swallows. The norm is to spit it out. Each to their own I guess.<br /><br />This is the story we are told in australia lim.

				It fucking auto finalized when I was sick, fuck cunt otherwise I wouldnt care so much.<br /><br />Mosh that was for the three wise men bruv. They will be suitability pissed! Staying calm for the next 48 hours to see if he will man up. <br />What pissed me was he called me a noobi scammer, and again I stayed polite. I was genuinely excited as all<br />Aussies are that it got through. And generally at that point I usually finalize anyway. But when i did a line I first thought, oh maybe my binge, tasted no numb almost sweet. Smelt like the potent foul speed paste smell. Gave it to two others, nothing. Put it in water and collected at the bottom. Cooked in no oil this ain&#039;t fucking coke cunt! Hard as fuck dry as all shit and when you manage to chop it it was a very fine powder, maybe say, I don&#039;t know caffeine + lidocaine??&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Anyway we shall see. Just think the stealth thing is a wee bit convenient, stops the feedback showing, and his comings and goings. Did I say tony69er also did that. Just saying, na think it was a genuine fuck up.

				Early June mate. A few people have messaged me with the same thing. The thing that is fucking stupid, people have problems so they open some chicken shit shrill account and complain. They get flamed and the vendor wins. Think tony the cunt. So many fuckers were licking his ball sack they forgot the shit the was going to drop. We all need to listen to concerns, and if you have delt with that vendor send them a message with the forum link and say what&#039;s up. I literally just sent AA a message on this very thing. If a vendor IMO doesn&#039;t respond back to one of there regulars, a red flag has just gone up.<br /><br />Fuck I rambling, I just what PF TO MAN THE FUCK UP LOL! &gt;:(

I remember the joy of landing my first 360 flip. :D<br />I used to roll down to Cantelowes skatepark on Camden Road on a Saturday and spend the whole day there.<br />Then I went to college and got involved with drink and drugs.

In chemistry if the reaction is over (which in this case it has) you do not use heat on a compound because it can make it degrade, you use ventilation to do it so thing extraction fans or the open air. Honestly just trust me on this mate, we made that mistake once and lost half a key of Meph but the principle is the same for all chemicals. Was a sad day. <br /><br />Also with Cocaine the melting/flashpoint for it is 180 degrees so this is where it burns and is destroyed however that doesn&#039;t stop it being hurt at temperatures close to that. <br /><br />And yeah Knomo we will have to see, like I said Ketamine along with Meph is taking up all my time at the moment but if it&#039;s viable I may do Amphetamine. I am not too clued up on Base Amphetamine though, isn&#039;t it really dangerous when it&#039;s pure or something?

Motherfucker I&#039;m the same age as her parents and I just now got a fucking iPhone! &gt;:( God...why can&#039;t parents give their kids an Etch A Sketch or a Rubik&#039;s Cube like I played with when I was little? Shit, what the hell happened to books? Fuck nooks, books smell and feel better. I feel sorry for them, they&#039;re doomed to ADHD from all the multitasking they&#039;re programming their little minds to do. No way in hell will they be able to concentrate growing up. :&#039;(<br /><br />I have trouble playing any Xbox Live games anymore, I get called a pedo by 12 year-olds on there because my voice is deep. Well bitch, last time I fucking checked the game is rated 18+, shouldn&#039;t you be watching Spongbob or Dora the Explorer you stupid squeaker? Don&#039;t get pissed at me because I can strategize and rule at video games. Whatever...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s sad, Children are having their Childhoods taken away one way or another! And forced to grow way too quickly :(<br /><br />If a parent can&#039;t be a proper parent looking after a child&#039;s physical and mental growing up, instead of raising their child with technology as his/her babysitter it&#039;s just plain wrong :(<br /><br />Nothing beats the human touch!<br /><br />Why can&#039;t they just go and play with their care bears and my little ponies - I was perfectly happy, and probably all the more creative for it! :)<br /><br />And parents reading stories, that helps the child develop too :)<br /><br />Children need interaction not distraction!&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well i try to be a good father with my daughter :) And yep human touch are really what a child need. I do 100% agreed with ya on this !

Should work out fine though, wouldn&#039;t have put the spends up to give it a spin otherwise. It&#039;s getting quite close to kick-off with it all so I don&#039;t mind talking about it now when I didn&#039;t want to before. Will keep you all informed as things progress. <br /><br />And I didn&#039;t get a half-key of Meth mate, I got 400g of P2NP which is the direct precursor for Amphetamine and Racemic Methamphetamine. Sort of like the main ingredient if ya like. Listings are up for it now. :)

				Yeah you have to perform a reduction on P2NP to make it into straight P2P and then you go from there to make either Amphetamine or Racemic Methamphetamine. I am not sure of the synthesis of either but you can get them just by searching Google. I know the synths themselves are relatively simple though, especially with Amphetamine. I briefly discussed it with the guys I work with and they said I could probably make it work if I had a set of instructions and had the technical jargon explained. I haven&#039;t had any training like them but I pick up the basic because I help them out while they do it.

				Queefing is such a funny thing.

Typically performed on balconies or porches, these women would insert various large objects in their TOOTS and slowly pull them out to create the desired sound. These &quot;porch parties&quot; would provide hours of fun for the ladies while the men were away, and, from a practical standpoint, at times, enough air circulation as a respite from the brutal summer heat. Small wagers were often placed with the winner going to longest continuous queef, highest pitch, lowest pitch, smelliest, and wettest. There was also the queef sing-a-long; and a special prize was given to any women whose queef could attract wildlife.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Ah yeah, that cunt from 300 is a bad mother fucker. He don&#039;t take no shit. <br /><br />As you know I have no side in this argument because A) I can&#039;t take sides, I&#039;m a Mod and B) I have purchased from him and had no issues myself. <br /><br />I do see why you would be pissed though, and I will say it would have been wise to come and make some sort of general statement on the forum, assuming there was nothing to stop him doing so of course. I&#039;m half way through a buy with him now and it&#039;s confirmed shipped. Personally I&#039;m confident I wont have an issue but I&#039;ll report back either way. <br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m about to go up the shop to get some Innocent Smoothies and some smokes, does anyone want anything?

				Ok well it would seem that I can update you on my second buy from Pfand a bit quicker than expected. Got 5g in 2 and a half days from dispatch which I think deserves some praise as it&#039;s coming from a different country. I haven&#039;t tried it yet but I might do a bit later on but on looks and holding it up to the light it looks exactly the same as my first purchase. It&#039;s still the tacky product which is always a + to me.<br /><br />Also got some lovely looking MD from Ivory today. MOONROCK MUCH?&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Sup peeps, just want to say I&#039;ll be heading out to the woods to shroom tomorrow and get funky with the forest spirits. If I don&#039;t return then I fear the worst has come true....I&#039;ll have become a woodland shaman! :o<br /><br />Anyways, anyone have any good combos for shrooms? The best possible combo I have in mind is a hippy-flip, but I&#039;m open to suggestions if anyone&#039;s ever tried anything better? :D <br /><br />Oh, and by tomorrow...I mean today considering practically all of you fuckers live on the other side of the globe.

				Morning all... Crashed out really early last night, must have been 10pm!! Up early on a weekend now! Sounds like fun times Gaz..

Your right, it&#039;s a little fishy!!<br /><br />TT - Space cake takes ages to wear off... I always feel fuzzy after some...

				Yeah... Sounds like a lot! My cake I made was 7 grams of trim (Just fan leaves mostly) I found while on a walk... It looked like a factory had been hastily chopped down and there was 20 or so plants just dumped in some local woods! I had no bag on me so stuffed my pockets with leaves.. I did a cannabutter extraction, made a cookie, fucked it up with too much butter, so covered it melted chocolate! (in an 8inch pie dish) Me and wife need a slice no bigger than 2inch squared to be tripped out! First time we took WAY too much (Probably double or triple that amount) Like a slice of cake.. We were FUCKED! The misses seriously started to freak... <br /><br />Really easy to do the cannabutter extraction though! - I&#039;m gonna do it again when this batch runs out! It&#039;s great for a night in with a movie... I don&#039;t smoke anymore you see (Was a smoker for 15 years!) - So it&#039;s the only feasible ROA for us now!!

				Your not being direct bro. You want a guaranteed Aussie pick up line for those English hotties. <br /><br />Used only recently when I was there and worked a treat. You gotta promise to keep this to yourself though? And only willing to share with you because your a ugly cunt like me!

				Nobody watches Looney Tunes anymore. :&#039;( I wish more people in the world would take the time to review the past, just because somethings old doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad. I&#039;m constantly trying to get my friends to watch movies/cartoons from the 50&#039;s-80&#039;s, or listen to older genre&#039;s of music, or even books written decades ago......do they care though? Of course not, fucking culture-deprived fools!<br /><br />And I am in no means a bigot, but rather open-minded. It&#039;s not like I try and force this upon them, but I&#039;ll send them a text saying <br />&quot;Hey, wanna come over and chill? I&#039;m going to smoke a few bowls and watch Red Dawn, you down? :))&quot;<br />....&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah well fuck you too, have fun watching Jersey Shore asswipe.

				OK now you need to understand this is 100% on English Ladies. 97.5 Aussie and no need to use any pick ups for the US chickies.<br /><br />U stumbled onto this gem when playing the slap game. You know the game when your out with mates and you can&#039;t be fucked picking up and your all in the mood for a good laugh. The guy who gets slaped gets a free beer. <br /><br />Now you might think this sounds easy, I mean say something rude get a slap. Well not so very challenging indeed. One of my mates and if you know him you will defo know this move, so pm me as it don&#039;t identify yourself. <br /><br />So he would walk up to a girl and say &quot;hey what&#039;s up&quot; the girl would say hi back. His next message would be &quot;can you hold my beer for a second&quot; no prob was the usual response. He would then proceed to pull down his pants (with no underwear in) and then ask the girl for his beer back, and continue to carry on a conversation as if nothing was wrong. Funny as shit but didn&#039;t land him a slap! This eventually became his trade mark move regardless with we were playing the game or not. I guess when you are blessed with a horse Dick your confidence is somewhat higher.<br /><br />Anyway so this is a bit of background to how the eventual line was born.<br /><br />So there I was thinking wholly fuck no slap I have got to be more obvious. Not in a take off more clothes sense, as my Willy is far too small for those antics, more in the words I choose. So here I am thinking what to say, go to a fat chick and say, fuck your an ugly fat pig? Na too obvious, and generally the DFF (designated fat friend) that each group of hot friend have, is generally backed up by her possie. So no we need more direct in your face statement, sort of a shock and awe approach which will leave no other alternative than, a slap or potentially worse a knee in the groan. Now a knee in the groan was a much sort after prize as you were then granted free drinks all night. <br /><br />While deep in thought and at the corner of my eye one mate score success, the slap echoed through the establishment and an almighty raw went up by my group. Eager to understand how he achieved the slap, the victor comes confidently back to proudly to receive his prize and share the story. Now while not subtle he attained the slap by nipple crippling the girl. While laughing with tears rolling down our cheeks and without any notice our victorious mate in the middle of his victory speach is in a headlock being punched and kicked while getting dragged out of the establishment. From that moment rule 1A was born no physical contact aloud. Rule 1B also was announced, mates were to continue to stay at the establishment while the evicted Peron went home.<br /><br />So my job became increasingly harder as I was thinking easy hand up skirt free drink. But with the inclusion of 1A this is now eliminated. Back on to words. Now I don&#039;t know if it was the beer consumed or the sneaky line in the toilets, the solution hit me like sperm into a hookers mouth!<br /><br />With the strategy confirmed by begin casing the one who I confidently knew would place her beloved hand across my face. While walking through the pack I see what could be the sexist individual surrounded by her crew and of course the DFF I walk up palms sweating the adrenalin pumping and start. &quot;Hey&quot; speaking generally but looking at the hot girl! The DFF starts hey how you doing? A little bit of vomit entered my throat as I replied to this hideous creature, while you are attractive and you probably have the best personality ever. It your friend that has got me this way. An immediate smile appears as I get the entire group on side. As let&#039;s face it Hot girls always have a friend that is ugly, they know there ugly, and they will always say when trying to set them up yea she is pretty but her personality yada yada. Anyway with the group allowing me access to this &quot;victim&quot; I start the bullshit bla bla confessing first time I have done this bla bla. The hottie will in almost every case start the education process. Well you start of by buying the girl bla bla and its at that moment when you interject and start the what is now called the line. Listen I can do all that shit but honestly I am here to see if there is any chance? Silence, confusion follows and the alway same reply comes back huh is there any chance of what? And now the moment I have been waiting for and to claim my prized free drink from the boys. I lean over look straight in her eyes and say. &quot;Listen you know it and I definitely know it, women like to fuck! So my question is let&#039;s cut all the bullshit do you want to fuck&quot;<br /><br />With jaws clenched in anticipation she (and instead of violence) whisper back &quot;but whay will I tell my friends&quot;<br /><br />So there you have it, this is an absolute true story of how this line was born and as I have said it has been used on many an english backpacker. And numerous hot women with so much success it really is ridiculous. I honestly kid you not. I challenge anyone to come back and say bullshit after they have tried it. I can also disclose O0 will 100% vouch for this. Do it but use this wisely!<br /><br />My secrete is now passed to thee......

				Well done on getting your refund Hoffa.

Urgh sometimes I think vendors on SR are fucking retarded, I got a request for my ML service and I messaged back saying &quot;Yeah no problem, what is your per calender gross and what is your average volume of monthly sales&quot; replies back with &quot;Why do you need this information&quot;<br /><br />Well why the fuck do you think I need this information you silly fuck?

				Opium&#039;s nice... Without being all &#039;smacktard&#039; - Very mellow buzz, esp if you eat it, you only need a 0.25g to get a very mild buzz on! - I always mean to buy more, but then the pharmar&#039;s win out... Morphine sulphates good too.. Bit stronger than the opium though! (I&#039;d only get a little of anything) Stops a binge dead in its tracks!!

It was like it had a brain on its back, fucking rad. Also saw a cardinal, it was like everything red was a symbol. Anyways, we spent about an hour huddled under a tree hiding with our umbrellas from the storm. We thought it would be cool to run through the forest nude for some reason, damn boomers. Overall, it would have been perfect minus the illegal aliens and if I hadn&#039;t had taken so much sleeping shit the night before because it made me too drowsy which sucked.

Sorry if you were expecting some drugs, I`m not gonna be selling those because the drugs here are all imported and expensive, the risk is big too. My friend wants to sell helicopters and vehicles through me, but I`m thinking that I`ll only do that once I become a really established seller. Thanks but I`m using windows currently, I do use linux too though. I`ll be sure to use it when I set my hardware for dual boot. I already have a metadata stripper for now.

				http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31186.0<br /><br />Read the thread. His stupidity lies in the fact that he has tried to shaft me on one my my most highly-praised products. In the feedback for it (which is quite a while ago now because I sold out of 018 a while back) it gets commented on how pure it is. None of my products are ever cut/stamped on/impure and that&#039;s something I take very seriously.

				Ok quick question... i have done a couple K worth of transactions but have been lucky to have them all arrive till now, still hope though.... but one is 3 days from auto finalize and the other 6! the first i think is a goner cause its always like 6-7 days tops from that vendor but I have never used resolution before and am curious how it works because i do not want to mess up my perfect stats... so say i go to resolution what will it say under the refund % thing cause i know some vendors wont deal with those people but im no scammer and will even finalize without receiving if its less than 150 just so i don&#039;t fuck my stats?? can anyone please explain how resolution works and how it affects stats??

				Yes, you are taking their word. Take a screenshot of the conversation, etc, and if you do not receive anything then message SR support. You can send funds just by username on SR I believe, although last time I tried it kept telling me to try again later lol. I&#039;ve never had a dispute, so I&#039;m not too knowledgeable on the subject. Anyone care to chime in :)?

				The only time I started a resolution it did not mess with my stats. Basically when you start a resolution you first make a offer to the vendor, say 100% refund. If he doesn&#039;t respond to that within 3 days or so, a SR staff member steps in and checks your story. <br /><br />So what you want to do is to elaborate what happened in the resolution center best you can and hope for the best. <br /><br />When I think about it I think that when a SR staff member refunds your money it doesn&#039;t mess with your score, but when a vendor refunds it does.

The best one I did was a Korma with sundried tomatoes, olives and slices of boil eggs in. FOOOOKIN BEAUT. <br /><br />Yeah I might have to blast the PS3 for a bit.

				Lol yeah I did that thread because 1. I have a zero-tolerance policy for that shit and 2. I get kinda sick of hearing other vendors becoming slaves to their number and taking hits from scammers (that they know are scammers) to preserve it. You can&#039;t be a pussy about that shit. I sent him these since I last posted on that thread -<br /><br />(in order beginning with when he changed the rating to a 1/5)<br /><br />LOL you fucking pussy. You think changing the rating and taking me down to 97 is gunna make me allow you to scam me. You fucking degenerate piece of shit. I know your type cunt, you are the kinda of prick that makes their mothers feel like necking a bottle of aspirin and downing a bottle of Smirnoff every time they look at you. You&#039;re filth, no more than the shit off my shoe.<br /><br />Hopefully your made up family will get cancer, be better off that and snuffing it than having to deal with having you in their lives.<br /><br />Cunt.<br /><br />His response - <br /><br />Morning Lim , I trust you slept well ? <br /><br />My response - <br /><br />Yeah I dreamed of you getting hit by a car in front of your parents/Mrs/Kids, slept great.

It&#039;s funny tbh because he pays more for shit that&#039;s under 20% that he sells for £100 a gram when he can buy PF&#039;s shit for less and sell 80% uncut fort the same price and make more spends. <br /><br />What a truly fucked up world we do live in....

				Lol Cap you will make a killing on that. <br /><br />And DOC has some effects similar to LSD but it&#039;s part of the Amphetamine family so it also has some of the features of that family too, hence it being a Psychedelic Amphetamine. It&#039;s for more experienced Psych users. Doses are 1-5mg. It&#039;s Phenethylamine equivalent is 2C-C. It does have stimulant effects.<br /><br />And yeah I&#039;m expanding the Lim magic kitchen menu considerably atm.

				Yeah DOC is in the Amphetamine family but has psychedelic properties, hence the name &quot;Psychedelic Amphetamine&quot;, they are much more complex structures than Base-Amphetamines like Amphet/Methamphet/MDxx. <br /><br />Yeah I am considering whether to do it or now or later. I just wana get all the stuff that is selling a bit slow cleared. Got some guy who wants 10g of DOC though so that&#039;s always a bit tasty. <br /><br />

Got some bud and also got a gram bag of diazepam and aint done that for a week.<br /><br />Will grab a few pints in the pub whatever.<br /><br />Not the kind of place for going wild on MDMA as the company is older.<br /><br />Need to go to an all night drum and bass - 1000 rpm, and that is the slow shit to chill to.<br /><br />Hope your night is a good one.

				Because I had this big order sorted out and basically I am not selling it from my own stock but basically buying it from the people who do my RCs and shipping directly to the client. I explained quite clearly that I need the cash up front because I&#039;d essentially be buying it for them and my people don&#039;t front product like that. Chinese labs aren&#039;t Cartels that front you 100s of keys, they work contractually like all professional laboratories do, the only time they do favours is if you overpay them on a previous order or you have paid for something they couldn&#039;t do or something like that and even then, having a relationship like this takes time to establish. Anyway yeah, did all the price agreement, did the listing, guy ordered and then I said ok, once you have FE&#039;d I&#039;ll get the shit into production and they responded saying &quot;Wait a sec, you want me to FE for an XYZ costing order&quot; when I had said this quite specifically beforehand.....<br /><br />You have to bear in mind as well that I am not touching this order, it&#039;s going from my manufacturer directly to the client and I&#039;m just putting a very minimal finders fee as an introductory price (which would go up on the second purchase) on top. <br /><br />So yeah...piss-poor by all accounts IMO. Hoping he pulls it together so I don&#039;t have to get angry.<br /><br />Oh and Metal is GAY! :P <br /><br />Anyone watching The Talented Mr Ripley?

				Nice....But yeah I dont really like Metal music but each to their own innit! The festivals I wanna check real bad are Burning Man &amp; SXSW in the US, also Exit in Serbia and Montenegros in Spain and when I go Thailand I gotta go to the Full Moon parties......Yaba is big out there which I believe is just Meth innit? But not crystal meth...I love danbce music so love those kind of festivals!<br /><br />Lim, that&#039;s basically how Googleyed and Fred The Baker operate aint it!? Just ship direct from the source countries direct to client then making a slice on top? Fucking amazing biz plan...Its all bout being a good middleman as &#039;Layer Cake&#039; tells you.

				Without going into too much detail it&#039;s not hard to find Chinese/Indian labs but it is hard to find GOOD Chinese/Indian labs and even harder to find ones that will help you do illegal shit. And again, without going into too much detail they obviously take steps and implement certain measures when shipping yes but I wont discuss those openly. <br /><br />It is a labour of love to find decent suppliers and ones that can do custom-synthesis or supply me lab equipment/precursors as well as the usual shit though. You have to build relationships with them just like you would a dealer/distributor for more common drugs. Doing them favours gets you quite far with them.

Users have reported aphrodisiac effects, minor changes in visual perception, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, emotional shifts, muscle tension, and mild tremor. The body load seems to be milder than with 5-MeO-DIPT. Sometimes there is a tendency of dreamy separation of mind and body as with 5-MeO-DMT. With the smoking route, more visuals and a &quot;rush&quot; are reported.

				Hi, just wanna ask a quick question and it does not deserve I thread.<br /><br />Do still have good E pills in Europe and USA or just in Netherlands? I saw some very positive feedback for dutch vendors, but I don&#039;t wanna buy in silkroad due my situation.<br /><br />I remember when I was teen, and it was not because I was teen, the pills were awesome! Nowadays it looks impossible to find pills containing mdma in Brazil, don&#039;t matter where you are inside the country.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what they have, we don&#039;t have lab test in Brazil, but they just keep you wake, what makes me believe its some caffeine/taurine/guaranine/bad cocaine [yeah, in S.A. makes sense cut E with coke], but that&#039;s all. I chewed a piece yesterday and at least the taste looks not so bad, of course I don&#039;t see it as advantage.<br /><br />Some tricks to know if it is good before try it?

Like spring onions for example....Did you know that they actually are supposed to have a massive fuck off onion on the end instead of just a slim stick thing that we get over here? I couldn&#039;t believe it when I first saw one!! Oranges and nectarines and stuff are just heavenly!!! Sooo big n juicy. Just shows that we just get all the crap stuff sent over to us in Blighty.

				^^ yeah absolutely man!! To be fair I&#039;ve done quite a bit of travelling around the world, like the US &amp; Mexico, most of the EU, Aus &amp; NZ with a stop in Tokyo for a couple of days but I&#039;ve never really been to and spent time in a country with TOTALLY different culture to western society....I mean Mexico was the closest to that but it has a lot of Spanish influences &amp; is catering for US and Canadian tourists with a lot of US corporations there. Tokyo also was different but I did not spend any proper length of time there to fully immerse myself or to explore outside of the capital. <br /><br />I&#039;m super excited to see what SE Asia has to offer and to live out there for a while! I also need to do a year in South America too. Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru &amp; Argentina are all on the list!! My mate thinks Colombian &amp; Argentine women are the hottest Latino&#039;s??<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m fucking bored to fuck!! No-one about tonight at home but kind of thinkin of popping up town for a bit!<br /><br />I love the UK for music production! I think we have the most diverse music scene in the world....

				I also browse SR almost exclusively when working. I&#039;ll check an order at home if one is on its way but the forums I feel better getting paid for reading this shit!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Anyhow, we were bored in work so a few of took a modofinil tablet 200mg. Still waiting for it to kick in.<br /><br />One of the guys got some of sesampinos latest coke and reports its quality yayo. Not washed, no need, sometime you get a coke that needs no washing as there are no bad effects, no burn, no numbing instant effect plus the creeping slow euphoria, the classic tell take sign is the lack of want as with redosing.<br /><br />Also, smoked some&nbsp; silver haze, this was a sour type, lovely shit, and was a 12 weeker<br /><br />Longest plant ever was the original Jack Herer which was left for 15 weeks. So lanky the guys supercropped several times - tied branches in knots.<br /><br />Some its a typical Monday night shift. We got in early as we want to get off early. I am the sober one, only drank some beer and smoked some bud and hash this weekend but my other three musketeers were banging MDMA, 400mg of banging gear. They took it Saturday so its a suicidal Monday. Lazy bastards would play cards all night but its like we get paid for actual work. No work no pay so we tried the modafinil. One of the lads wants to do a few lines of coke but you cannot work on coke. Not in our game. Mixing yayo with modofinil seems a bit of a waste to me.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what drugs people use myself. I will happily smoke some top bud with the lads but the rule is that you have to handle your drugs here - no room for passengers who curl up into a ball after a bit of Indica home made hash. We got a gut into heroin, but the guy works, I don&#039;t give a shit if he is hitting up as long as he can work. He can be left alone on a job and never lets me down. <br /><br />The worse are the alcoholics. Some are ok working but I am not cutting corners with health and safety. So if anyone comes in drunk, they can lie down out of the way. <br /><br />Once worked with a bunch of Yugoslavians who were the biggest piss heads I ever saw. Some hated drugs also! Even argued with the English lads but the younger Yugoslavs were peace makers. Once big Yugoslav fronted me calling me a junkie for smoking hash. We put them right and made peace in the end. It was the younger Yugoslavs smoking a weed with us who stayed the pace and got their work done whilst the drunken ones slept.<br /><br />Yanks were good to work with. One guy we passed him like 3.5 grams of bud to build a joint. He built a blunt for us. 3.5 grams of ever loving smoke. Got a bunch of us stoned as Bob Marley. Americans settled into the UK work style culture. We even let one guy slip back to the USA as his mum was sick. We covered and he got paid and even wept because we slipped in tons of overtime. <br /><br />You always get stoners no matter what nationality. I like working with guys who turn on - even the ladies also.<br /><br />We work hard, what the fuck is the problem with drugs being illegal?<br /><br />Thanks SR!

Time isn&#039;t going by dreadfully slow either!<br /><br />Not a fan of LSD, had no control over the trip and felt shitty the next day. Not worth it imo. I prefer shrooms and some of the 25&#039;s :)

				I don&#039;t have the willpower to go more than 24 hours without a fap, but the thought of having to compete for and having to arrange sex with another human being is just too much of a pain in the arse. The internet offers to much variety , too many new and interesting ways to watch people fuck. Just wish I could get in on it from time to time. My sex drive is in cruise mode now, a shadow of my younger self in overdrive. But i&#039;m at peace with it.<br /><br />I also think the lessening interest could also have to do with the endorphins released during orgasm, kind of like how if you roll your serotonin gets depleted and you feel depressed for a week (if your anything like me). Again, my mind is half baking here. Just thinking that the brain may lessen the pleasure to protect itself somehow.<br /><br />btw Caparino... You watching Futurama Series 7? Whats your opinion? I think its still on form&nbsp; ;D

All good things, porn is even better because you get the added benefit of Serotonin lol! <br /><br />Don&#039;t see why your brain would want to limit them, when it&#039;s all good! <br /><br />Unless someone knows more about this subject?

Your brain&#039;s reserves sort of deplete though, if you don&#039;t have consistent sex. Its a natural stimulant and if you don&#039;t keep doing it your brain needs time to reach homeostasis.

Some users have reported that if you take 25i with mescaline the trip is as pleasurable as LSD and even better, 25i agonizes the following receptors:<br />5-HT2A (0.044), 5-HT2C (2), 5-HT6 (73), 5-HT2B (231), u opiate (82), kappa opiate [288]<br />and mescaline agonizes the following receptors :<br />Alpha2c (4.00), 5-HT2B (3.97), 5-HT1A (3.61) Imidazoline1 (3.44), 5-HT1E (3.16), alpha 2a (2.92) and poorly agonizes 5-HT2A &amp; 5-HT2C. My next try will be to combine the two&nbsp; ;) Theres a quote from a guy that have taken it with mescaline:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">25i-nbome shares much of the mindspace of acid (euphoric, entheogenic) but has the visuals of DOI, when however 25i-nbome is combined with mescaline, the trip then becomes nearly indistibuishable from acid in every way (same meaningful archaic/mystical visuals), more visual than acid however, more pleasurable than acid, and music sounds even better than it does on acid, a few added benefits over acid, perhaps slightly more mystical as well, it lacks absolutely nothing, fully mind-manifesting. 100ug to 350ug of HPBCD complexed material under tongue for 20 minutes = light trip. When combining with 200 to 250mg of mescaline hcl, be sure to keep the 25i-nbome HPBCD complexed material at 350ug or so, you do not want the 5-ht2a &amp; 5-h2c of the 25i-nbome to overpower the 5-ht1a and 5-ht1e of the mescaline, keep the receptors in balance if you want a beautiful very acid like experience, do not exceed 350ug of 25i-nbome, or the experience will become &quot;too electric&quot; and &quot;too analytical&quot;, keep things in balance.<br /><br />All of the great natural psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, dmt, etc. place 5-HT1A &amp; 5-HT1E, 5-HT6 &amp; 5-HT7 receptor agonism strength well ahead of 5-HT2A &amp; 5-HT2C visual/complex behavior agonism, this keeps the trip spiritual, mystical, euphoric, serene, mind-manifesting and well-balanced. If you notice, most/many of the synthetics lack strong 5-HT1A &amp; 5-HT1E agonism, which is why many of them can seem very &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;emotionally neutral&quot; or not fully mind-manifesting. Take a look at Ray&#039;s paper above attached and you&#039;ll see what I mean. You do not want 5-HT2A &amp; 5-HT2C agonism to overide 5-HT1 agonism, unless you want a trip that is mostly meaningless visuals with little meaning to them. Keep the receptors in balance, study the paper, and you&#039;ll understand in time. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

I&#039;m itching to get that 4-Aco-DMT!! Is it similar to NN- DMT??<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />25i-NBOMe is very tame compared to acid &amp; boomers, I&#039;d say it&#039;s almost entirely recreational in my opinion. It&#039;s energetic, gives great but not strong visuals, and gives a mildly trippy yet clear headspace as well. Overall it&#039;s a fun drug to do with inexperienced friends any day of the week, preferably outside because it&#039;s very synergetic with nature. ^-^ 2C-E is slightly stronger and feels like LSD light. The visuals are on par, although more sparkly, but the headspace isn&#039;t as enlightening as LSD. Everyone I know loves LSD, but 2C-E doesn&#039;t work as well with everyone because it&#039;s picky in a way. Some folks get euphoria comparable to MDMA coming up, others get twitchy and puke and feel terrible coming up although most feel better after the purge. It&#039;s definitely worth trying though and so long as you&#039;re lucky enough to enjoy it, it can be one of your favorites like it is mine. ;) Out of the two, I really like 2C-E better. 25i-NBOMe makes me feel too tense and my body gets sore after the peak and the trip is only a few hours long, while 2C-E makes me feel super and lasts at the least twice as long so it&#039;s twice the fun. :))<br /><br />As for 4-AcO-DMT it&#039;s nothing at all like DMT, they&#039;re not even in the same family I believe. It&#039;s like 5-MeO-DMT, they both end in DMT but are completely different experiences...tricky little fuckers. :D I&#039;m still waiting on my sample from Limetless before I buy any so I can&#039;t speak from experience, but from what I&#039;ve read on the substance it&#039;s exactly like shrooms without the nausea and instead is much softer and calmer. I hope I get mine soon though because I&#039;ve been wanting some for when I go camping soon but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it. So if I get it this week I can try it out and buy some for the trip, otherwise I&#039;m just going to buy an ounce of shrooms considering they&#039;re more reliable at the moment. :D<br /><br />Oh, and about doses I prefer 2mg for 25i and 26mg for 2C-E, but if you&#039;re just starting out I&#039;d probably go with 1mg 25i and 15mg 2C-E. I&#039;ve gone up to 6mg of 25i and 32mg 2C-E and all I noticed was the negative effects increased while the positive stayed the same so there&#039;s no point in going higher with either of them. So basically tread lightly and you&#039;ll have a blast and a half. ;D

I hope I get mine soon though because I&#039;ve been wanting some for when I go camping soon but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth it.

I&#039;ve gone up to 6mg of 25i and 32mg 2C-E and all I noticed was the negative effects increased while the positive stayed the same so there&#039;s no point in going higher with either of them.

				+1 for that info Gary O! Exactly what I needed to hear! I knew I could count on you bruv!! :) <br /><br />I&#039;ve been wanting to try mescaline too.....The mixing of 25i and mescaline sounds like a fucking good plan!! thanks ilovelsd69 +1 to u too!<br />To be fair, I&#039;ve seen a few listings on SR but its synthetic or has dodgy reviews on the sulfate....I might just buy a cactus in the UK legally, aged 8 yrs.<br /><br />Also, would you say changa is worth doing? or just freebase DMT? That 5-MeO-DMT looks very very strong!! Have you used this drug anyone? It is available here but thought I&#039;d start with the NN-DMT to see what it&#039;s like...<br /><br />I love tripping in the summer out in the countryside....Top shit! :)

				hahaha yeah it would but you can get recorded delivery and its insured apparently. <br /><br />Any other suggestions other than MtGox would be greatly appreciated!!

Also only just managed to get the last of Jannis&#039; 5x blotters which was lucky :D, if anyone is unaware of Jannis at the moment he&#039;s a new LSD vendor who has very nice prices, paid £32 for 5 (110ug) and IIRC 10 was about £55, so far he has 100% feedback from ~30 transactions and allows you to stay in escrow provided you&#039;ve spent double the amount of bitcoins worth the listing price.

				i don&#039;t think gox accept cash deposits any more, so you have to transfer from a bank account to theirs - there&#039;s your ID. i suppose you could use a pre-paid credit card to transfer the cash, but they also freeze your account if you use tor to access their site so you&#039;d need to spoof your mac address and use a public hotspot to do it that way. pain in the fucking arse by all accounts

				Any Amerifags ever watch FOX News to see how fast it takes you to change the channel? 5 seconds in the female reporter started talking about how she wakes up with dancing. The male correspondents asked what kind of dancing?<br /><br />...It turned into a 5 minute back and forth about how she does some &quot;booty shakin&quot;. Now my penis made me stay tuned to this but my brain yearned at me to change the channel as they prodded her (giggity) with questions and comments about booty shakin.

				EZ crew! TT good day at the beach? im not jel in any way at all!! ;)<br /><br />I love the Dam to visit but It probably would piss me off after a while, but London has its fair share of tourists and I loved living there and you get better drugs in NL generally speaking, so can&#039;t be too bad I suppose!! Dutch birds are hot &amp; safe as fuck too!&nbsp; :P<br /><br />I stopped taking all psychs for years aftyer a bad trip off shrooms, infact, about 10 years off and only started again with 2C-E a few months back....I&#039;m really liking them again! 2C-B is minor at 15-20mg. If you take 30-40mg that is a strong trip. It does fucking kill to snort it unless you get the pressed tablets that has filler in there too which makes it very smooth to snort.

Kryptoz has offered me his services for a wooden sword set which I am currently working on. After it has been received I plan to ask him to join the project and possibly commission other work . There is another person who has offered me his coding services, I have yet to come up with a concrete plan so I will be writing one to him after this post. <br /><br />If you have any services at your disposal that you feel I might need/interest me do tell me.

				lol, I&#039;m so detached from pop culture... New Batman is Dark Knight rises ain&#039;t it.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Just googled Dark City, I saw it a couple of years ago (I have a really shitty memory) pretty cool movie, I remember it made me feel very claustrophobic and grim, love a movie that can generate emotion like that. Have you seen Spun? It&#039;s about meth addicts and the way its filmed makes you feel really wired and jittery like you are one of the addicts. Awesome film making.<br /><br />The more time I spend with smartphones the more I want my old Nokia 3310, the functionality is great n&#039;all but they seem to be so temperamental. Maybe that&#039;s just HTC or the custom ROMs I use, I guess they are worth the hassle though. Nothing like being able to compare prices when you are in a shop, use google to settle an argument in the pub or watch youtube videos on the crapper ;D

				well, my psychology lecturer once told me, people used to joke that i treated bud like heroin, I used to play up to that and he said &#039;it&#039;s called &#039;the self fulfilling prophecy&#039; <br /><br />The more people talked about me like I was a junkie, the more I acted up to it, and then, sadly I became what I had feared all along.....A heroin addict.<br /><br />I&#039;m cool now and have not been a functioning daily addict for two years but the legacy still lives as I am still into all other drugs in a big way, but I just try to manage my addictions a little better now I&#039;m older.....I do H once a month still, can&#039;t shake it totally!!!

				Most people use H to come down from crack use so a lot get hooked to both that way....Personally, I love a pipe of freebase or crack when sniffing lines of coke. Its like smacking you in the face when you are already high as shit!! To be honest, it&#039;s stereotyping that has given crack such a bad name, as it&#039;s essentially a more effective method of consuming cocaine into the bloodstream, but its the stigmas and stereotypes that give it such a harsh rep....<br /><br />oh shit! that 2C-B has kicked in now!!! bluuuurrrgghhh <br /><br />To be honest, if the whole prohibition thing was lifted, H would be one of the cleanest drugs available. In UK hopspitals, people come out loving the &#039;morphine&#039; they got tghere......What they dont tell you is that it is &#039;Diacetylmorphine&#039; which is pure Heroin. Obviously if it was broadcasted &#039;Its Heroin!! the public would go nuts.....But oh its &#039;medical morphine&#039; its fine!!!!! lol funny the whole prohibition bullshit.....

So what if 1 stupid moron kid died of some Designer Drug, he would have probably killed himself in a car or with alcohol anyway. They start a &#039;war&#039; on designer drugs trying to ban it from all the stores etc, while they forget that alcohol and cigarettes are available everyfuckingwhere and cause way more harm to a person/society.. <br /><br />Bleh..

				The first time I got high two of my friends got into a drunken brawl with each other, somehow a cop showed up, and there I was rubbing spit on my eyes and trying to pretend to cry, thinking I was clever as hell because the cop would see it and take pity on me, but all the while I was laughing and grinning, and for some reason I just thought the whole thing was hilarious.&nbsp; So basically this cop was staring at me rubbing spit on my eyes and laughing, and one of my drunk friends kept bawling about what his girl friend would think because she was a total bitch, so anyway, somehow or another the cop took pity on us, and basically just left, we would have only gotten a drinking ticket anyway, but still.&nbsp; Anyway, probably didn&#039;t explain that too well, but if it was on camera you guys would be crying with laughter.

Proabably one of the many Hard Candy sites upload DBs hacked and taken offline. Tell me you are not downloading pictures from these sites? DOWNloading as well as UPloading or just uploading?

I don&#039;t really care either. For what it&#039;s worth I think he is wrong. She sounds NOTHING like who he guessed it was.
