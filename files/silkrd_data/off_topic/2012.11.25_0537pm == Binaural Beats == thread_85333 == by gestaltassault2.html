				I listen to them occasionally to help me relax, or when I am meditating. When I meditate listening to them, I get into a really deep state of meditation that can be very peaceful. They also help me go to sleep sometimes if I am wound up after a long day.<br /><br />I find it amazing how the beats, no matter how subtle, can seriously alter your mental being at any given moment. <br /><br />I know this isn&#039;t much of a contribution, but said i&#039;d contribute so I could read about others people&#039;s experiences.

				I&#039;ll use them as background filler once in awhile when my iPod is playing, but I&#039;ve never actually felt anything from them. Once I cut a ping pong ball in half and put some 400$ over-ear headphones on and gave a few a test run, but again I didn&#039;t feel a thing. I&#039;d love to hear about an actual user that got some effects from it though so I&#039;ll stay tuned.

				they seem to be more effective if your headphones have a good dynamic range...binaural beats use very specific frequencies and if your frequency range doesn&#039;t cover that frequency then it won&#039;t work....

				i once listened to a binaural beat which claimed to replicate the effects of LSD on a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones while doing homework in the computer lab at school...after about 5 mins of listening to the beat i started feeling muscle tension in my arms and particularly my back which felt exactly like the muscle tension you feel during the onset of an acid trip...i didn&#039;t get any visuals but the feeling was substantial and freaked me out enough that i took off my headphones...it was indeed a trippy experience because i had not ingested any psychoactive substances that day and yet the beat was able to alter my consciousness on a tangible level...

Never got anything more than a placebo effect.<br /><br />Tried them (no recollection what frequencies) during a k-hole at least twice during my early experiments in inter-dimensional navigation.<br />If I recall correctly, it just gave me a headache.<br /><br />I always found ambient music much more effective for directing the ketamine experience in interesting directions.<br />Cf., Orbus Terrarum, by The Orb or Lifeforms, by Future Sound of London.

				They work best if you have taken drugs in the past or if you are on drugs while listening. That&#039;s my experience anyways.

				It&#039;s all just placebo effect in my book (especially those &quot;replicate&quot; tracks, utter crap imho). And I&#039;ve collected just about everything in this genre of &quot;self help&quot; that&#039;s ever showed up on places like bitme. For example, a lot of this stuff is made by a few studios, like the Monroe Institute, Hemi-Sync etc. Most of these come in the form of a multi-month program, where you progress through a series of audio files ie listen to the first once a day for a week, then move onto the second. That is the &quot;proper&quot; way you&#039;re supposed to use binaural tracks. I tried several of these, out of what I&#039;ll call a journalistic curiosity, but what I found was that it is better to NOT increase the amount of time your brain is inundated with external stimulation, which is ultimately all this stuff or anything else is. It&#039;s better to let your thoughts flow naturally as much as possible, and exercise and eat right. You do that, and interest in this kinda stuff will probably dry up. That was my experience, at least.<br /><br />That being said, I listen to a select few choice tracks every once in a wile for different purposes. And I&#039;ve found a handful that can make a great pairing with LSD. Haven&#039;t done too much experimenting on this front, but there are a couple (Glenn Harrold comes to mind), that are produced with an eye towards the spatial/psychological aspect of the listening experience, and when played during the early peaking phase of an LSD trip, can produce an amazing synesthetic musical journey. So at least they&#039;re of some value. ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=85333.msg623990#msg623990">Quote from: fuckingACE on November 25, 2012, 09:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I swear by them, I listen to the generator on my PC with my etymotic headphones, sends me to sleep every night<br />ACE<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But what happens when the zombie apocalypse strikes, there&#039;s no electricity, and because you&#039;ve conditioned yourself to need these tracks to fall asleep you&#039;re now unable to get a decent night&#039;s rest? Everyone knows it&#039;s the exhausted ones that will get their faces chewed off first. :P
