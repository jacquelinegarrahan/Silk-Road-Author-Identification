				hello thank you for taking the time to read this<br />&nbsp;, i have been working hard on setting up a vendors page and i noticed that you can only have one picture per product , i have taken 2 pics per product one of them on the box and the other close up view of each side nextt to each other,&nbsp; I was wondering if you would be so kind as to tell me what would you prefer to see on a vendors page when purchasing a tablet/pill/ product? <br />My link to my page is at the bottom all listings live tomorrow .<br />Kind regards <br />RP

				What I do is set one pill facing up and another facing down and take the picture. Both sides is the picture... I get a prescription of Roxy 30s that I have conspired about selling online for 22 a piece

				Similar to SMokweed420:<br />Dont give a flying fuck, as long as its the product stated in the listing, <br />and (more important)the price is right.<br />After all a bitcoin is 8-9 bux now.<br /><br />

				Split the screen into two and post them both in one picture, or put a link to more pictures in the description. I wouldn&#039;t think the split pictures would be very good quality though.<br /><br />Locker.
