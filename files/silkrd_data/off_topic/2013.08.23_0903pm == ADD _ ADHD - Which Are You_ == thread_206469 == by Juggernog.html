				So I have read quite a few people talk about ADD and ADHD.<br /><br />I was diagnosed with ADD when I was like 12 however I choose to not believe I have ADD.<br />I seriously just think they just came up this diagnoses because they had no other explanation for children and adults that have a hard time paying attention and what not. Think about it though our world is speeding up around us, so in the long run MORE AND MORE people are going to be diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. Of course people have attention disorders. look at our world.<br /><br />Also since I am just fucked up right now and this is mostly nonsense, what would those of you with ADD/ADHD say is your favorite drug for this disorder?<br /><br />- Hugs from Juggs! 8)

				other than amphetamines which is what i am prescribed for (my favorite is straight up dextroamphetamine which is a powder that you can snort like yeyo), marijuana is the best. i can focus on whatever i need to focus on for as long as i am high. I need to tell myself ahead of time tho that nothing else exists other than the project i want to work on. If i dont, then i can easily distract myself with the internet or television lol

				What the doc prescribes is either Concerta (methylphenidate) or Focalin (dexmethylphenidate). In my memory on ADHD medication, I never remember using an amphetamine based drug. Through conversation with my mother she told me that I was put on adderall and it made me sick and gave me nasty mood swings. <br /><br />I&#039;ve snorted both methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate and in my opinion, snorting it brings a quicker onset of desired effects and lasts just as long. <br /><br />Cocaine is definitely the best in terms of being able to focus, although I don&#039;t use it outside of party settings.<br />Weed just makes me really mellow and hungry, can&#039;t work like that. <br /><br />Seeing the post above makes me interested as to how I&#039;d react to opiates.

				@CrunchWrappedCoke I like coke too, but only in the same circumstances. PARTY. I found it hard to in public while on coke.<br />Weed on the other hand, I cannot smoke Indica and be productive, but sativa was a different story. Sativa is quite motivational.<br />Try smoking some &quot;green crack!&quot; talk about some major focus and energy!<br /><br />Give opiates a shot. I swear it is the best medication for depression and social anxiety.

At one point i was poppin 8 vicodin in a half hour time span and then dosing again a couple hours later. Definitely borderline addict. Oxys were never my bag tho. Idk I could do H either. Amphetamines are definitely my go to. It takes some getting use to for the body feeling but it definitely works. Cocaine does too, but that can be too dangerous cause i can go too hard on that too. Rolling is helps me focus too, but thats cause it has an amphetamine&nbsp; base to it. I would still try those amphetamine again, just give it time and itll work.

				@Juggernog<br />What&#039;s the difference between Indica and sativa? I&#039;m not very well versed in the weeds since I&#039;m not the one supplying<br /><br />Also, suggest opiates to start with? I&#039;ve read up on a few opiates, but not sure what ones would work better for focus.<br /><br />Thanks!

				I was prescribed Concerta for ADHD around age 15, now in my late 20&#039;s.<br />Took it every day to school for 2 years. My grades went significantly up (say from a B student to an A). <br />One day I just decided I had had enough, I was pretty much dragging myself around school in a zombie-like mode. <br />I felt like an empty vessel, restless (but not hyperactive), drained, drugged. <br />Eventually had enough of it and stopped taking it.<br />I did feel that it did have a temporary lasting effect were I was still very focused. <br />But no way in hell I will ever subject myself to that &#039;treatment&#039; again.<br /><br />I STRONGLY believe this (and probably many others) is a drug that was manufactured before the condition. They needed a viable diagnosis to sell it under. They couldn&#039;t just go ahead and advertise this as a &#039;drug for concentrating&#039;. And they needed to create an actual condition rather than it being a one-off thing, were you just take the pill when needed. They call it a &#039;treatment&#039;. <br />So they orchestrated this whole ADD bullshit. <br /><br />Of course not everyone has the same levels of attention, but there is no drug in the world that can correct or treat this for you. The only way to fix this is by taking conscience each time you get distracted.<br /><br />FUCK PHARMA !!! I WON&#039;T JOIN YOUR ARMY OF ZOMBIES !!! THE MIND IS STRONGER THAN ANY OF YOUR DRUGS AND I CAN SHAPE IT, MOLD IT, AND PLAY WITH IT HOWEVER I PLEASE!!!<br /><br />

I&#039;ve been well and things are looking great so far. You know i&#039;m interested in nootropics, &quot;smart drugs&quot;, that are very low in neurotoxicity... I&#039;m looking into noopept or Modafinil (Provigil)... I&#039;ve been getting my act together to be more organized and I do have issues focusing, i&#039;ve been doing a lot of reading and researching, i&#039;ve noticed i have a little issue with short term memory and focus. Gonna check out if theres any noopept on SR, if not i&#039;ll go for Modafinil
