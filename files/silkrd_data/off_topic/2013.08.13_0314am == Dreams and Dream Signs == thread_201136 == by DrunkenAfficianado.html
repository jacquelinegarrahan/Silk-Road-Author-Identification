				Hello.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />This is a thread for Dreams, Dream Signs, Lucid Dreaming, Steven La Berge info, fear, horror, sex, reoccurring night mares, reoccurring nice dreams, the various effects of chemicals on your dreams, etc.<br /><br />Anything at all to do with your dreams--- <br /><br />Why!?!<br /><br />Because I find this stuff interesting and real dreams are too weird to make up, and you can kind of tell when it is real....<br /><br />So that is why.<br /><br />Thanks.

				Self-bumping with the first post.<br /><br />I have a reoccurring dream that is not a nightmare.&nbsp; And it only reoccurs when I am dreaming, I do not wake up the next morning and say, &quot;Oh, that dream&quot;, I can only be aware that the dream is reoccurring WHEN I AM ALREADY ASLEEP.<br /><br />Then I am like, &quot;Ah, I have been here before.&nbsp; I wonder why it has taken so long to get back?&quot;<br /><br />And the reoccurring dream is in bright afternoon daylight and in color, and I am driving on a very complex interstate in maybe a transparent car, though the method of movement is not that big of part of it, instead the crux of the dream is a see a distant interchange that I need to get to but have never used before, sometimes if I successfully navigate the transition I end up in a geography at a different time of day on a highway that I actually have driven on in real life and the entire scope of the dream then skews into the narrative and environment of the new story until it transmutes again or I have a false or real awakening.<br /><br />So I guess I am describing some meta-tool that I have experienced in getting through the transition from one dream to another. :o

				On nightmarish horror..... ;D <br /><br />I am not afraid of things like Freddie Kruger when I sleep.&nbsp; I do wake up with the falling dream, but this is not the usual nature of my personal nightmare.<br /><br />The worst nightmare I ever had was early in an extremely ugly break-up, which devolved further over the next five years.&nbsp; It was before I consciously knew any of the actual facts, but somehow my subconscious knew, and I had the worst nightmare I ever had.<br /><br />This would have been around almost 20 years ago in 1995.&nbsp; Again, I dreamed in color and light but this time, the color was extremely wrong, and the dream undulating around me but also in the person of a large snake creature bigger than me and humanoid but also snaking.&nbsp; It was like nothing so much as having the Universe XXI card from the Crowley Tarot open before me and being pulled into it from a normal apartment stairway, and I could only get out the other side I could not wake up until it was time.<br /><br />The next 20 years would be a living nightmare beyond the norm, and I wish I had of gone insane and lost coherence; instead it was like a literal slow motion amputation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now there is nothing I encounter that is in anyway disturbing in terms of fear.&nbsp; Perhaps getting old is simply losing all healthy fear.<br /><br />Cause I don&#039;t fear, sickness, poverty, or death anywhere as much as having to ever live those twenty years over again.&nbsp; And that dream presaged it, and having told myself that a true major shit storm was in the process of hitting, did any kind of fore knowledge keep even the smallest terrible event from occurring?<br /><br />No. Other than some argument for &quot;catharsis&quot; brought about by an appreciation of insane horror-- no-- all I can say is in this case it exacerbated the suffering in those life events.<br /><br />Any other comments appreciated.... feel free to share.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				On the experience of music in dreams.....<br /><br />I have had a dream where I woke up and remember having heard Beck&#039;s &quot;Jack-Ass&quot; during a dream about a firing line at a rifle range during a picnic, and when I awoke, I remembered the song but didn&#039;t know whichy one it was, so I had to surf through the discography until I found the track.<br /><br />That is the one time I have heard someone else&#039;s music in my dreams unless I am already partially awake, and some how drift back off humming the Stones.<br /><br />Otherwise, when I hear music in my dreams, I try to wake up and record it and get it down on tape or cell phone or computer....&nbsp; then I totally forget the inspiration, and then I rediscover the pieces long after and only remember exactly where the tune came from maybe 65%<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;

				Interesting... I have some pretty crazy dreams and do enjoy dreaming very much.&nbsp; When I was growing up I usually only had nightmares, or no dreams at all.&nbsp; Now that my dreams are all happy/fun/interesting/thoughtful (other than the occasional bad thing) I find myself wishing that they were real.&nbsp; I have a sleeping disorder, but when I sleep it is so deep that it practically becomes my reality.&nbsp; When I wake up, I feel like I have been gone for years.&nbsp; Sometimes I am relieved that my dreams weren&#039;t my reality, and sometimes I feel a deep sadness for the same reason (I get over it by breakfast).&nbsp; Have you ever felt extremely strong love for someone else in your dreams?&nbsp; That is the most disappointing thing to wake up from&nbsp; :&#039;(&nbsp; Isn&#039;t it weird how you are happy to wake up form a bad dream and then sad to wake up from a good one?&nbsp; I guess it can be vice-versa in some situations.&nbsp;
