				Have you ever noticed how some vendors have more fans than sales? I&#039;m not implicating anyone for anything, I just thought it was unusual. How is that though? I have checked a lot of new vendor&#039;s profiles and seen them with at least a dozen fans but they haven&#039;t even made any sales yet. <br />I had been dissmissing any new vendor that already had fans. Now I&#039;m seeing products I&#039;m interested in from vendors who have established themselves but still, for some reason, have more fans than sales. Are SR members just randomly adding vendors to their fan list without even doing business with them?

				Maybe because they advertise on the forums and give out samples before they actually make a ton of real sales?&nbsp; Dr. Gonzo would be a good example of this.

				I do it with new sellers that have products and prices I like so I can keep an eye on them for the future<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be one of the first to buy off a new seller ever, but that&#039;s just me

				I have more fans than sales, I just assume that it&#039;s because I am active on here a lot so people look and bookmark it or because some of my products are high value so they are bookmarking it for when they can afford it.&nbsp; :-\

				I have more fans than sales. God knows why :S. I had like 15 fans before I even made a sale. Like Lim said I can only assume it&#039;s for people bookmarking so they can have a look for future access.<br /><br />Dank

I also agree that new vendors should show-face by talking on the forums and discussing what they know about, I know that helps people put their faith in me in particular those wanting my ML services. In fact I actually do more trade out of the ML consultancy work at the moment than I do from the drugs lol. The drugs are catching up nicely though. :)
