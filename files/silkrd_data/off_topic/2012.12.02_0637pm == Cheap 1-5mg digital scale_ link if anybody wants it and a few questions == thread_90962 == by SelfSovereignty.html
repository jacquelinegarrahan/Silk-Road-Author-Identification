				See the bottom of this post for a link to a ~$22 USD digital scale that apparently really does have 1-5mg accuracy with a max of 20g (see Amazon review).&nbsp; I can only assume that if I looked at it sideways, it would fall apart in my hands... but for $22, even if it only lasted a month it&#039;s cheap enough to be worth it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really expect to find a decent 1mg accurate scale for less than a few hundred no matter what, but I&#039;m posting because a) I&#039;m surprised you can get a scale that accurate for that price at any quality -- thought somebody might like to know, and b) is it really as suspicious &amp; &quot;attention grabbing&quot; as they say to buy a scale for these measurements from a source that&#039;s subject to US enforcement?&nbsp; (yes, we&#039;re assholes and enforce things everywhere, but you know what I mean)<br /><br />Yes, I know I could buy one on SR.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen a couple, but none within 1-5mg accuracy, they&#039;re more expensive, and honestly I don&#039;t know a damn thing about any vendors except the ones who deal in my drug of choice... and I&#039;m too lazy to research sources for anything but said drug.&nbsp; And why pay 1.5x more just to risk losing half of on a no-show... shrug.&nbsp; Ordering from Taiwan or China can&#039;t hurt, provided customs don&#039;t decide to lose their minds and give me a hassle over it, right?<br /><br />Oh, and it isn&#039;t illegal or something retarded to own a 1mg accurate scale, right?&nbsp; I know, sounds idiotic, but hey -- so&#039;s prohibition to begin with, and they&#039;re still all about that, right.<br /><br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM<br /><br />Just in case some poor guy doesn&#039;t realize it, that&#039;s an Amazon link, and Amazon and eBay supposedly even set up special systems for the law to investigate purchases.&nbsp; Meaning buy it somewhere else if you want it, unless I&#039;m just paranoid &amp; spooked by myths; just an example + reviews either way.

				I have a very similar scale. The display is the exact same and so are the buttons and their order. Mine is black, doesn&#039;t have a logo on it and has a slightly different design/shape. The electronics inside might very well be the same or at least very similar.<br />These cheap scales work but they are virtually useless if you&#039;re trying to weigh less than 10mg. They work just fine for quantities over 10mg though.

				I just bought that exact scale (from Amazon UK... oops).<br /><br />I got it because I only really need 0.01g accuracy... and figured getting a cheap scale that claims it can do 0.001g would probably mean it does 0.01g at least slightly well.<br /><br />And actually, I tried it out... I&#039;m impressed. It came with a 10g weight for configuration. You hold down the &#039;On&#039; button to get into configuration mode, it flashes &quot;10g&quot;... then you put the 10g weight on it to tell it how much 10g is exactly. Then I tried it out in normal mode, put the weight on it multiple times, expecting it to read varying outputs like 9.997g, 10.003g etc. - But nope, it was dead on 10.000g each time.<br /><br />I&#039;d recommend doing the configuration each time you use it (only takes 1 minute), and I can&#039;t vouch for the build quality because it&#039;s brand new (but for all I know might break after 3 uses...), but for a cheap scale it does the job (for me).<br /><br />I&#039;m not a dealer, so precise measurements aren&#039;t hugely important for me. I just wanted something to tell me I&#039;ll be doing roughly 145-150mg MDMA rather then judging it by eye and doing anywhere between 60-200mg, haha.

				Had this scale for about a year, it&#039;s great never had problems and the build quality is just fine.

				It&#039;s a great scale! I&#039;ve been using it for a few months, weighing out random items that have known weights. It&#039;s been very consistent so far, weighing duplicate items at the same weight with a +- 1-2 mg range. To reference, the tiny dish that comes with it weights 2.700-2.703 on my scale (there&#039;s a bit of glue on the dish from the tape it came with).<br /><br />I&#039;ve measured out MDMA pretty easily (as +- 10mg is perfectly fine), and I&#039;ve even used it on RC&#039;s like 2CB.
