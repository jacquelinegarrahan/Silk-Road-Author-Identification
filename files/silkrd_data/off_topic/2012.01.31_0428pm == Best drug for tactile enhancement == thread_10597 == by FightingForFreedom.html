				I once got the tactile enhancement of MDMA and it was great, but I never got the same feeling back.<br />When I felt the tactile enhancement I found that more awesome than the etactogenic effects.<br /><br />So are there any other drugs that give a GREAT body high? GREAT tactile enhancements?

It really doesn&#039;t mess with your headspace but you get a lot of cool visuals and you get a lot of tactile sensation. It also makes girls uncontrollably horny. <br /><br />I think playboy explains it better than I do. <br /><br />http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dipt/5meo_dipt_article1.shtml<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now my body is a strange combination of hot and cold--one second I&#039;m trembling, and the next my thighs are slick with sweat. Although the physical sensations are like nothing I&#039;ve ever felt, I&#039;m mentally unchanged. I can speak clearly. but because of the delicious electrical rivulets running along my tongue. I&#039;d rather kiss John&#039;s lips and the soft nest of his throat. Everything, suddenly, is a sex toy: a hair on his chest, the bedroom curtains blowing in the breeze across my ass. <br /><br />Shivering from the subtlest waves of pleasure, I close my eyes as John runs his hands over me. &quot;Do you realize you haven&#039;t stopped moving your belly erotically for three hours?&quot; John says, and I say, &quot;Seriously?&quot; We&#039;ve put on a CD of Algerian ra√Ø, a spell of Saharan wailing and drumming. I&#039;m no longer aware of the boundaries of our bodies, only the rhythm they make together. <br /><br />John turns me over. &quot;You feel so subtle,&quot; John whispers, sounding out each syllable like they taste good in his mouth. I&#039;ve been uncontrollably wet all night, and now, at last, I&#039;m ready. The foxy sex is searing and endless. Foxy sex turns my skin inside out. Together, John and I shape-shift into different positions like figures in a Mayan hieroglyph. <br /><br />I&#039;m a Venus flytrap, about to snatch an orgasm the size of Alaska. I don&#039;t need an area code because I don&#039;t want anyone to call. <br /><br />The postsex cigarette hour is filled with weightless intimacy. Some drugs lead to a comedown period of hellish introspection, but not foxy. &quot;It&#039;s not like This Is Your Life, &quot;John says, &quot;starring you and your brain and all of your neuroses.&quot; I can barely remember my problems, my gripes, the lingering doubts I have about John&#039;s suitability as a long-term partner. In fact, I&#039;m almost disturbingly serene. I&#039;ve gone from being a hypochondriacal girl on the rag, so to speak, to a yogic instrument of divine will. Nothing he could do would hurt me right now. I wouldn&#039;t care if John went dancing with 15 sluts in white go-go boots and I stayed home and ate Twinkies.<br /><br />The sex never seemed to stop, even when we hopped into a cab at one A.M. en route to an after-hours dance club. Our cabdriver dialed all his margins so tight and with such precision that I could have whispered into the ears of the passengers in the cars next to us. Sometimes he fucked the road, stroking it with effortless, powerful confidence. He made it look easy to charge red lights that magically turned green as we crossed the line. During the smooth ride we witness a procession of lights and flitting human minidramas unfolding down Broadway through Times Square. Everywhere the night went, there was a beat, and we were always in sync with it. <br /><br />Whoa. Maybe this was too much of a good thing. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its a pretty intense drug.

				I guess that drugs that give tactile enhancements should be taken in light to medium doses? Does the body high turn into an uncomfortable body load at a high dose?

Everywhere, couples are languidly knotted together like octopi in heat. A disco ball spins lazily above, and refracted bits of light strobe across flesh and faces. I stumble past stacked fur pillows and a candlelit incense altar. At first the 10 or 12 couples spread out around the edges of the circle don&#039;t seem to be looking at anything, but after my eyes adjust to the darkness I see that in fact they are staring intently at a prone couple rocking vigorously by a wall. The girl is on top, and her ass rises and falls steadily. Her navy-blue canvas sailor skin is pulled up around her waist, and I can&#039;t take my eyes off the rhythmic jiggle of her cheeks. <br /><br />I glance at Isabel, who is busy giggling off compliments on her slutty mermaid costume. &quot;Are they really having sex over there?&quot; I say to no one in particular. <br /><br />From the shadows to my left someone says, &quot;Yeah--they&#039;re on foxy.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its honestly the only tryptamine that is good for sex.

				If you aren&#039;t getting the tactile effects from MDMA, try waiting a bit more between rolls.&nbsp; Or try taking piracetam supplements. It really makes MDMA flourish.
