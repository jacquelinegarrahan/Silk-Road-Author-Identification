				Free samples. Have some parties at your friends places and smoke down with them. It takes time to build a customer base but if you have great prices and great buds then you&#039;ll get there eventually. Do you know any pot smokers who go to college? Do you have any trusted friends that hang out in clubs?&nbsp; It sounds like you need to add more trusted buyers to your list so you may need to spend some nights at clubs or bars just socializing&nbsp; and when doing this be sure to play the part of the guy who&#039;s looking to score some bud. The guy that helps you is your potential new client.<br /><br />You can do well in the mdma game to. There are people who love it

				well I am in the same boat as far as needing more buyers for my goods and I don&#039;t drive but I am thinking about slanging on the Road because it is much safer and the cops here are every fucking where so it is much safer to slang anonymously on the road. <br /><br />If you do MDMA there at your house just try to do it with trusted friends and sell to nobody els and tell them that nobody is to know and that you will pick the people you want to sell to. If they call you and are with somebody tell them you don&#039;t fool with that shit then talk to them later about it. <br /><br />Tell them you will never have anything if they have people you don&#039;t know with them. Seriously what you are talking about takes time. How to get more buyers but do it on the down load so you won&#039;t attract the wrong people right?

				To be honest, I believe OP is the kind of dealer that usually gets busted quickly. Absolutely no offense meant MrSkunk, but I just get the risky-type vibe off your posts. The amount of times you mention money, profit, prices, ect.<br /><br />I&#039;d just hate for something to happen to you, that&#039;s all. The substance market needs its suppliers. Be cautious, do your research, plan your steps carefully, and don&#039;t rush into things.

				All sounds a bit odd. Your friend is the biggest dealer in the city, but all your friends get their weed from him?<br /><br />Well a city indicates let&#039;s say 100,000 people plus, and we can safely say 5% of them are smoking on a regular basis, if not a lot more. If your friends aren&#039;t dealers, why are they directly linked to someone who potentially supplies over 5,000 people? And how does this guy have enough time in the day to be selling to street customers if he is so big?<br /><br />Anyway, whatever. If you want regular customers for weed get in with the young affluent crowd. Colleges are your best bet, and be available 24 hrs a day.

				I agree with abby25, the college crowd is definitely your best bet. At my college ( and every single college I&#039;ve ever visited ) there are fucking DROVES of people looking for good weed. And there&#039;s a lot of them that get weekly money from their folks that SOLELY goes towards weed. Much more demand than supply. However, if you&#039;re not the kind of guy that would fit in on a college campus, then I doubt you should go there - people get sketched out quick at colleges and you never know what could happen.<br /><br />But the MDMA market at colleges is booming as well, especially if you have a college in a city that has a nice rave scene. But with MDMA, you do have to be careful - the penalties are usually higher for distribution and there WILL be times when you might have to fight out of getting robbed.<br /><br />What I did when I dealt at my college is sit at one of the smoking gazebos ( my college didn&#039;t allow smoking except in designated smoking areas ) and shoot the breeze with people. Obviously it was easier for me because I went to the college, but sitting out there later at night from around 8 pm to 12 am, I usually found at least several people looking for some weed. And most of the people that are looking for weed ( if they&#039;re not narcs ) are usually pretty docile, and the reason they&#039;re looking is just &#039;cause they don&#039;t know anybody that has any, or don&#039;t have any connections at all. Stick to naive people - but don&#039;t go after people that have a sketchy feel to &#039;em. There are a lot of kids in college that will get pinched and sing as soon as they figure out they can save their asses and stay in college. Be careful. It can be very dangerous.
