				I really dont see it, people call psychedelics a roller-coaster but deliriants are a whole new kettle of fish. Most of the datura reports are complete horror stories. Anyone here experienced any deliriants? And if so, why? lol<br /><br />Feel free to post your views on the topic too

				Actually, believe it or not nutmeg is a great deliriant. Not really sure if it&#039;s worth it in general, but I&#039;m glad I tried it a couple times a few years back, just to satisfy the curiosity. The annoying thing is that you really must cap it up. The taste is much too strong to take it any other way; though on the other hand nutmeg burps are actually quite pleasant. I forget the proper dosage ratio, but making 20-30 caps should be nobody&#039;s idea of a good time. And just for the record, you MUST drink water constantly the day before, all day prior, during, and the next day. All the horror stories you&#039;ll read on erowid involve people not drinking much if any water. But I found that by going the extra mile on hydration, and experimenting conservatively with dosage until you find the right level, there&#039;s really no negative body load or hangover.<br /><br />As far as whether it&#039;s worth it, depends mainly if you&#039;re a cataloger of altered states. I found the nutmeg high to be relaxing and conducive for meditation. It was easy to imagine myself being in a monk&#039;s temple on some hidden Tibetan peak. There was a mild opiate-like sense of euphoria. Peak lasted like 1-2 hours before retreating. It&#039;s not something that will blow your mind, and the prep (water and capping) aren&#039;t great. I&#039;ll probably never bother doing it again, but I can&#039;t say that it&#039;s not a good time.

Sounded like a fucking amazing trip. Vaped Xtal.

				Just a bit of pagan lore. . . <br /><br />Deliriants are used in old medicine throughout the years.&nbsp; Not as a divinity tool, but as a poison to give your enemy or someone you want to control.&nbsp; So, it was secretly given to people before decisions were made.&nbsp; To cast a spell on someone with powerful magic.&nbsp; Delirients are useful to for things like adding it the wine at church and the holy water.&nbsp; it makes church goers believe and sinners repent!

				They are taken for those on a spiritual path, or those exploring their own mind.<br /><br />They are not taken for recreational purposes.<br />
