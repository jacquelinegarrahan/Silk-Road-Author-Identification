				I do..&nbsp; But it&#039;s not very exciting..&nbsp; And, to top it all off,..&nbsp; My boss doesn&#039;t understand the painfully simple concept of: &quot;if it&#039;s not broken, don&#039;t fix it&quot;..<br /><br />Which makes it not only unexciting, but more stressful then it has to be.<br /><br />We do have some cute girls that work with us though..&nbsp; Always a bonus!

				Yes, it&#039;s pretty relaxed and not too bad.&nbsp; I&#039;ve worked in a few record stores over the last 5 or 6 years.&nbsp; Some are terrible, and some are a lot of fun!&nbsp; The difference between working in a record store, and say, another retail environment is that people drawn to working in record stores seem to understand each other a lot more than in other workplaces!

				yep, work for myself as well.&nbsp; Have a couple of companies, have staff&nbsp; working for me etc. I don&#039;t drug test, nor would I fire someone for using drugs.

Not to mention you&#039;ll actually have real cash after graduation, rather than debt, which works out waaaay better when you take your year off afterwards. ;D
