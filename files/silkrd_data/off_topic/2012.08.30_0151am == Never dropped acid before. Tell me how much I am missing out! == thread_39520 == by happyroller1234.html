				Well, actually, I took a tab about two years ago, but hardly felt threshold effects till I smoked some good weed.&nbsp; But that was prior to my having ingested any other hallucinogens, and I can now say confidently that I never entered a trip at all.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&#039;ve taken 25I, 25C, 2C-I, 2C-B, 6-APB, shrooms, as well as K and MXE (if those qualify as psychedelics), and had many marvelous experiences on all of them; however, I could do without 2C-I.&nbsp; <br /><br />I have no idea where to get acid IRL, and the SR prices have been so ridiculous for such a long time that I had for a while given up on experiencing LSD.&nbsp; But I just saw that DiMensionalTraveler is offering +/- 150 mcg blotters for $11.&nbsp; Should I get a few?&nbsp; What am I missing out on?&nbsp; Anyone have personal experience with this vendor&#039;s product?&nbsp; Will it really change my life as so many people claim it has theirs?&nbsp; How comparable is an acid trip to, say, 2C-B, or 25i-NBOMe?&nbsp; Any thoughts, suggestions, extolments, or experiences are greatly appreciated!

				The first time I took acid I remember thinking that I wanted to just keep taking and stay in that state forever. <br /><br />After a couple bad trips though I was dreading it more than looking forward to it. Always managed to hold it together but that&#039;s not much of an acheivememt. My advice try a couple. It won&#039;t change your life, the scales won&#039;t drop from your eyes and you&#039;ll see things as they truly are, infinite, but if you plan it right with people you are comfortable with in surroundings you feel safe in you should have a blast.

				Tend to agree about LSD being a little overrated. Perhaps due to it&#039;s time and place in history. <br /><br />Today the menu is much larger, much more sophisticated and nuanced, as OP has already discovered. <br /><br />Not even on my top 5.

				I agree it&#039;s overrated if you take a low dose.<br /><br />But trust me, a good dose is something more magical than you could ever imagine. It feels so right.

The 2Cs have their place for me, but LSD has always been the most profound. I assume Mescaline and Shroom would be up there as well, but I&#039;m yet to try them.<br /><br />OP, I look back on my first real LSD trip (over 500ug, but I realise dose is a very personal thing) with fond memories, much like my first roll. It&#039;s hard to explain as it&#039;s an individual thing, but I think you are definitely missing out :)

				there is currently some very clean WoW, truly close to 100 mic acid throughout the midwest and fest circuit. 2 of these and you would be precisely where you need to go. The trend on SR seems to be to claim huge amounts on the blotter when in real life if you ate 4 or 5 of actual &quot;280ug&quot; hits of true LSD you would be spun the fuck out, like melt in place. That makes me think these blotters are either closer to 35ug-70ug, or are not in fact LSD25 or one of it&#039;s close cousins. Shop wisely and best of luck to the OP, imo lsd is one of the two most important psychedelics, the other being dmt.

				I have only done acid once, cause that first time frightened the shit out of me, big time! :&#039;(&nbsp; Around 20 yrs ago (fuck, 20years!!)&nbsp; I popped a &quot;flying key&quot; on the advice of my missus at the time, cause they were so great and I was going to love it. Well,&nbsp; 40 mins pass by and I was starting to think if it was actually acid that i had taken cause I wasn&#039;t feeling much, if anything at all. On the advise of the missus (and I use the word advise very loosely), I was told to pop another one and before too long, I&#039;ll be trippin big time, an experience I was told would blow my mind. Well fuck me, approx. 20 mins later, I was standing in our front yard with some friends, who were also trippin with us, sipping a nice, cold beer when from out of no where came a giant mars bar riding a push bike straight at me! Fuck I shit myself!! I dropped the beer and run for my life for about 2km up the road and hid behind a tree, absolutely petrified. I couldn&#039;t see where it had gone. About 45 mins later, some of our friends drove to pick me up cause I wasn&#039;t walking home with the mars bar still on the loose, no way in hell. At this point I was fucking off my brain and regretting popping the second one, big time. Before going home, my misses, myself and two of her friends who had picked me up stopped off at the local shops near by to get some more beer and food for a BBQ. I wasn&#039;t keen on going into the shops but was too scared to sit in the car on my own, cause that was one fucking big mars bar that was after me and now it could be anywhere.. In the supermarket, one of the isles was full of lollies in these big, clear, glass cases screwed to the wall on each side of the isle. I wish nI never went up that isle cause suddenly, there were all these lollies screaming for me to open the cages and set them free. Imagine thousands of bananas, strawberry and creams, freckles, mint leaves, jelly babies, jelly beans, snakes and many other edible creatures screaming at you to open the doors. Fucking scarey shit at the time. I burst into tears in front of other shoppers, balling my eyes out cause the supermarket had all these lollies locked up. By this stage, I had other shoppers asking if everything was O.K, which it really was&nbsp; but in my mind , was now total chaos.As the girls with me watched on, they all of a sudden kicked off with inconsolable laughter. All I know is that everyone there would have known that this is highly, unusual behavior and I had to get out now! They had lost it big time and I couldn&#039;t calm their laughing down one bit, it just got louder and louder. By this time there was quite a scene happening in the lollie isle, a grown man balling his eyes out like a baby cause the lollies are locked up and can&#039;t escape&nbsp; and three grown women in hysterics who couldn&#039;t stop laughing. I just left the store immediately with the girls following, thinking when is this going to end. While the girls got the beer, I decided to buy an ice-cream from the cafe next door. After much deliberation, I bought a Buffalo Bill, at that time a favorite of mine. I then made the mistake of opening it up while waiting for the girls, still in the shopping centre in amongst many shoppers. I removed the wrapper when suddenly, I began having a conversation with Buffalo Bill, my cowboy ice-cream. He said Hi so what was I supposed to do? I couldn&#039;t ignore him as that would have been rude of me. I started eating Bill and after eating the top of his head, I stopped just above the big bubble gum ball he had for a nose. Bill was right cause if I had of eaten more I would of taken his nose and mouth with my next 2 bites and that would have been the end of my conversation with Buffalo Bill. I tried my best to preserve the rest but unfortunately, ice-cream does melt when taken out of the freezer. After feeling shattered on the way home that my friend had just died, I started to feel really, really sad. Everyone kept saying it was just an ice-cream but they didn&#039;t understand that to me, my friend Bill was real, alive and talking and had feelings. To cut a long story short, I had a funeral for Bill&#039;s skeleton (paddle pop stick) in the back yard a couple of hours later. The wave of emotions from uncontrollable bursts of laughter to balling like a baby over lollies and ice-creams to running for my life cause a giant mars bar was chasing me on his push bike&nbsp; was something I wasn&#039;t keen of experiencing any time soon !! :)&nbsp;

				Yeah, some acid can take a while to come on so be a little cautious, and always have&nbsp; a pile of valium nearby just in case.

				Acid is THE psychedelic imo. <br />I think with all the other psychs youve done you need to hit up some L. Its like the daddy of the psychs with mescal being the cool uncle and DMT the grandad who dont mind smacking you round the face.

				I&#039;ve only tried acid once and while I loved the effects I just didn&#039;t want it to last 12 hours. Maybe if I started earlying than 2 pm I would of enjoyed it more.<br /><br />Why could you do without the 2c-i? I&#039;m curious because I plan on trying it soon.

				allen carr&#039;s easyway to stop smoking did it for me. You pretty much get brainwashed into liking cigarettes, the book removes the veil before your eyes.<br /><br />if any hardcore H user out there wants to make an experiment: exchange &quot;cigarettes&quot; for &quot;heroine&quot; in the book.
