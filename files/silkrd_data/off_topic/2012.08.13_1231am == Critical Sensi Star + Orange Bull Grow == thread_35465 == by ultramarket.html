				Greetings,<br /><br />I was going to document my grow on other cannabis forums, but I had problems finding any board which allows registrations from a Tor IP address.&nbsp; Figured it would be less risky to document my grow here.&nbsp; Hopefully there are other growers here who can throw me tips or lend guidance.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This is my first grow all by myself and I am starting with a Delicious Seeds Critical Sensi Star (CSS) Feminized seedfrom BreakingBad, and Orange Bull Feminized seed from DexterMorgan.&nbsp; The Orange Bull has not arrived in the mail yet, but it should hopefully arrive later this week.&nbsp; My eventual goal is to have a perpetual grow - still debating whether to grow the seedlings into mothers, or to bloom them and just clone mothers beforehand. <br /><br />I have two 2x3ft grow tents equipped with 150watt LED grow lights.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is a model which uses a &quot;flowering&quot; spectrum with extra orange and white lamps.&nbsp; I have a suspicion that models with just red and blue would have been better- this will do for now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other plants have germinated and sprouted fine under these lamps, so I believe that it will suffice.<br /><br />The Critical Sensi Star was germinated directly in a 3 inch pot filled with potting soil and about 10% perlite stuck in a dark place.&nbsp; It took LESS than 48 hours for the cotyledons to pop above the surface.&nbsp; The seed came pre-scored (I believe) so that might have quickened the germination.<br /><br />

				Greetings fellow grower.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I&#039;m curious as to why you went with LEDs?&nbsp; Other than in a very few (expensive) systems, led panels are mainly marketing bullshit, and will not perform as well as HPS or even CFLs.<br /><br />You would be better served at this point by using cfls.&nbsp; Even standard 20 watt household ones are fine for seedlings, provided you get them nice and close.&nbsp; 6500k (blue spec) are preferable, but even red spec CFLs still put out plenty of blue light.&nbsp; A flowering spectrum led is completely lacking in blue, which is necessary for good veg growth, and will lead to stretchy weak plants when used in veg/seedling stage.<br /><br />I usually meet a lot of resistance from LED users on forums when pointing out their shortcomings, but I only do so in the interests of helping people get the most out of their plants.&nbsp; I have seen the grows that get passed around as &quot;proof&quot; that leds work, but I remain unconvinced.&nbsp; The few&nbsp; grows that aren&#039;t sponsored by panel manufacturers are generally done by expert growers who know how to get the most out of their plants, but when it comes to the average grower, these results are rarely, if ever replicated.<br /><br />CFLs for veg (Or MH, if you are feeling brave) and HPS for flower is the way to go, if you want the best bang for your buck.

				Sorry if my last reply came across as rude, I didn&#039;t mean it as such. Your concerns about heat and flir are not rational though.&nbsp; For a start, a watt is a watt, and it is all turned to heat eventually.&nbsp; Leds don&#039;t generate any less heat, per watt, than any other form of lighting.&nbsp; I recently made a post addressing this, check my post history if you are interested.<br /><br />Flir is not something to be concerned about unless you are doing a huge grow, or doing something stupid like hanging bare bulbs on the ridge of an uninsulated roof.&nbsp; Much is made of the dreaded eye in the sky on grow sites, but it is 99% propaganda, and the cops love to use it as a fear device when talking to journos etc.&nbsp; In reality, most people get informed on, or fail to take basic precautions regarding odors.&nbsp; Flir devices can only see surface temps of walls, they can&#039;t see through anything, so unless you are doing a full room grow, with enough wattage to heat up the walls, you are safe.<br /><br />As for amperage draw, again it is a non-issue, unless you are drawing many KWs you will not be &quot;flagged&quot;, as long as you pay your bills.

				Good job with the 600 purchase, they are the most efficient setup, in terms of lumens per watt.&nbsp; Do you have your extraction bought/implemented yet?&nbsp; Also, what area are you growing in?&nbsp; Your 3x3 tents you mentioned would be better suited to a 400 light, although i&#039;ve seen successful 600 grows in dr90s etc, so it is possible with good enough airflow.&nbsp; A cooltube or air-cooled hood will make life easier here.
