Being able to order MDMA from Europe for $30 / /gram is such a luzury.<br /><br />I&#039;m surprised the cannabis sales aren&#039;t higher on the poll. I am a weed vendor but I still try different strains all the time from other vendors / IRL.

				Wow what a great poll.<br /><br />I&#039;m kinda surprised actually. Well, sort of....I figured more people would be buying harder drugs online (this is where I came to try them, none of that street shit) but I guess most don&#039;t want to start a bad habit and those who have the habits can&#039;t really afford shit on here lol.<br /><br />and MDMA lmao damn all the kids and their mollys&nbsp; :P
