				I just joined and am curious as to what I need to do?!&nbsp; What security measures should I take? Where is most secure place to get Bitcoin? What is this rash on my junk?&nbsp; that sort of thing.&nbsp; I have been searching the other topics and just can&#039;t quite figure out what is applicable to me specifically.&nbsp; Sorry to bother anyone but its better to ask and know for sure than to face the worst because I am too proud not to ask.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Thanks in advance-

				I&#039;d recommend you start reading the &quot;security&quot; forums, especially threads / posts regarding &quot;general&quot; security measures (i.e. Linux [Liberte Linux], PGP etc.). There are some all-in-one guides please check them out, if you don&#039;t understand a certain topic, don&#039;t hesitate trying to inform yourself and if you don&#039;t find a solution to it, feel free to ask the community, from what I see, most people around here are really helpful.<br /><br />By the way, I think it doesn&#039;t really matter, where you get your Bitcoin, I mean, Bitcoin isn&#039;t something illegal.

				Your first priority should be how to encrypt/decrypt via PGP. When you order, it&#039;s in your best interest to use a CORRECT name and address. PGP allows you to hide that sensitive information from prying eyes, and allows the shipping process to go as smoothly as possible. <br /><br />If you have any questions about PGP don&#039;t hesitate to ask people about it; we were all new once. You&#039;d be surprised how many helpful and insightful people we have on The Road.<br /><br />That should be it. Welcome to the Road; were the sun always shines and the medicine is always plentiful. :D

				I sent a private message to you, but maybe I can help others with this information:<br /><br />Heh, I feel honored that you would reach out to me; and I would be happy to help in any way I can.<br /><br />The necessity of PGP varies from vendor to vendor, but to be brutally honest, I would never send my real name and address unencrypted. Even though you&#039;re using a TOR browser, and you may be anonymous while browsing, there is always a slight chance that unencrypted text can be intercepted on the net.<br /><br />-First things first, you&#039;re going to need a program to encrypt/decrypt text. Go to google (or any search engine) and download the latest version of gpg4win.<br />-When Installing, you will receive a prompt with a bunch of check mark boxes; Make doubly sure that the GPA box is checked (you will be using this program to encrypt/decrypt text.<br />-Now that you have GPA, you are going to have to make yourself a public key (I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed that many (if not all) vendors have a public key.<br />-In GPA, on the top, you will see an option for KEYS; Click it. It will ask you for a name (use a fake name). Then an e-mail address (use a fake one as well). Its your choice whether or not to make a backup.<br />-Now you have to make a pass phrase. I recommend using a 20 character or more passphrase.<br />---------------------------Now you have your Public Key-----------------------------<br />-Now to be able to post and send you public key (you need send this to you vendor if you want him to be able to decrypt your text).<br />-Click your newly created Key, and there should be an option to export your key. Export it to your desktop, and open it via notepad (not microsoft word; NOTEPAD).<br />-This is your public key. Save it for later.<br /><br />*Deep Inhale*<br /><br />-Now remember I said many (if not all) vendor will have a public key? Well, go to your vendor of choice and copy their public key. Paste it in NOTEPAD, and save it to your desktop.<br />-In GPA you will see an import button. Click it and go to desktop, and open the file with your vendors PGP key.<br />-GPA will automatically rip the vendors key and save it.<br /><br />-----------Now you have a key, and you have your vendors key-----------<br /><br />Now for sending messages......<br /><br />-In GPA you will see a clipboard option. <br />(Now, this part is only if you intend to send your name and address to your vendor)<br />-Type in your message and click encrypt; select your vendors name and click OK (Do NOT sign)<br />-You now have an encrypted message.<br /><br />That&#039;s all there is to it. Practice makes perfect.<br /><br />When you make your first order, you will be given an option to send a message.<br /><br />Send your public key along with your (encrypted) message. And you&#039;re done.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I know it&#039;s difficult at first, and if you have anymore question, please don&#039;t hesitate to ask.<br /><br />Silk Road is full of helpful and insightful people, willing to help.<br /><br />I really hope this wasn&#039;t too confusing. :)
