				I made a thread about a month ago saying that mephedrone is more euphoric than MDMA.&nbsp; I love them both... but can&#039;t decide which one I actually prefer.<br /><br />MDMA gives me more empathy and isn&#039;t moreish (for me anyway). However Mephedrone gives me a much more euphoric talkative buzz.&nbsp; But I end up finishing all the drone I have in a night. Music on both is incredible.<br /><br />I find myself saying &#039;No Mephedrone is no where near euphoric as MDMA&#039; whilst I&#039;m rolling. But when I&#039;m on Mephedrone I think &#039;This is miles better than MDMA&#039;

				Tbh I prefer MDMA because it sets you off for a few hours and with mkat I don&#039;t like having to go off every 20 minutes to do a line.<br /><br />Then again I think all the shit I&#039;ve had so far has been cut.. got a G of pure on the way from limetless so I&#039;ll update when I&#039;ve done that. PRAYING it arrives before tomorrow night.

				I&#039;ve not tried Meph yet.. It&#039;s on my to-do list... May hit Limetless up for some though! I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s my bag, but I&#039;m willing to be convinced!

				Are you sure what you&#039;re getting is actually MDMA? MDMA is in a league of its own. I&#039;ll go as far as to say MDMA is the second best drug known to mankind, behind LSD.

				I always have a line of drone just as I start to comedown from the MDMA... Instantly returns the euphoria! However it will be a lot more stimulating, so have some benzos handy if you&#039;re prone to anxiety.

I&#039;ve never heard of such things. MDMA for me has always been an anxiety DESTROYER, I&#039;m borderline fearless/masturbatory when I&#039;m on it, I don&#039;t see how it could cause anxiety?

				It does with large doses. I once swallowed a half gram bomb&nbsp; of drone in a rizla paper when I was coming down from MDMA. Felt euphoric for a while but then BOOM panic attack. (This is why I say no more than 300mg in one dose)

				And if you snort it don&#039;t make lines the size of the ones you would make from shitty coke.
