				Most mental movie about drugs you will ever see!: Naked Lunch.<br />I warn you its freakin weird.<br /><br />I also remember snorting huge lines of Ketamine then watching Sin City, that was also very weird, i&#039;m not actually sure if it was good or not, I certainly didn&#039;t know what the fuck was going on at the time. its just one of those things that stick with you.<br /><br />Anyway this is becoming a good list. Ill add another list of mind bending films that I found on the intertubes and have been working my way through:<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind<br />ExistenZ<br />Inland Empire <br />The Saragossa Manuscript - absolutely insane. if you can put up with black and white with no fx you might like it.

				One time when I got super paranoid high, probably the worst paranoia I ever felt in my life, I decided it would be just best to lock myself in my room and watch feel good movies. Well, I didn&#039;t exactly follow through and ended up watching Boyz n the Hood. I was feeling it. By the same token, I also thought Very Bad Things was a decent good movie to watch high. It&#039;s not a great movie by any means but it was trying to place myself in that same situation. There is something about recreating fictional peril in my mind that can be enjoyable at times, I guess.

				The only three movie experiences I ever had relating to drugs that were worth mentioning are:<br /><br />1. Taking a bunch of oxy then watching &quot;Spun&quot; with a bunch of 4th day awake meth tweakers.&nbsp; &nbsp;They had some guns in their trailer (yup, it was in a trailer) so I stayed close to the door.&nbsp; But for sheer excitement, it was TOPS.<br /><br />2. Watching the Mel Gibson thingy &quot;Apocalypto&quot; while doubled up on a shroom dose.&nbsp; There&#039;s like 1500 natives and every one is totally decorated uniquely.&nbsp; It&#039;s fucking amazing.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know how they did all that work every day.&nbsp; Awesomely awesome in its awsomeness!<br /><br />3. Watched the Doors when it first came out.&nbsp; Had only taken acid a couple times, many years prior.&nbsp; No drugs in me at all.&nbsp; But when they&#039;re out in the desert I had that metallic taste in my mouth and a few tracers suddenly appeared.&nbsp; Had only ever heard of such things; a very strange thing indeed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh yeah, Easy Rider.&nbsp; I had a little Honda 50cc mini bike.&nbsp; Only smoked my first joint a few weeks before.&nbsp; Saw that movie, chopped it out with a front end and even painted my gas tank like an American flag.&nbsp; Probably shouldn&#039;t have used house paint but it was cool as shit while it lasted. :P&nbsp; &nbsp;I was 12 and every girl in the neighborhood wanted to ride my &quot;chopper&quot;.&nbsp; hehe&nbsp; good times....&nbsp; God, I&#039;m old.

				Baraka - beautiful cinematography, editing, and film score.&nbsp; Filmed all over the world there are scenes of wildlife, cities, tribal cultures, and geography.&nbsp; There is no spoken dialogue but it&#039;s incredibly interesting and moving.&nbsp; Many of the camera techniques, especially the time-lapse shots, are really trippy while high.&nbsp; My buddy got blazed with me and watched it.&nbsp; He said he was seeing faces in the shots of mountains!<br /><br />Pineapple Express is another personal favorite.<br />

				There is a fantastic film by Jacques Tati called:<br /><br />-----&quot;Play Time&quot;-----<br /><br />It is an avant garde comedy from 1967, very much different from any other comedy I&#039;ve ever seen. (7.9 rating on IMDb). It is THE BEST FILM I have ever watched when high. I could hardly breathe through the laughing fits. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />And YOU MUST WATCH IT IN HD, preferably in a cinema with 70mm, or 1080p on a big screen.<br /><br />It is a movie about a weird futuristic society, and it has no main character and no conventional plot. A good tip when watching it: it is like watching ants running around, each doing their own thing, you can study this ant for a while, and then look an another to see what it does. Every scene in the movie is like that. There are no close-ups, everything is filmed at some distance, and the screen is filled with weird things that people do. For example, the funniest thing in a scene can be some person far in the background talking to a cardboard cut-out; just the way a person walks; a strange chair that makes a weird sound; someone doing something mundane in a rhythmical manner with very comic effects.<br /><br />It has been released on blu-ray, so go get it and watch in on a big screen. I say again:<br /><br />IT IS THE BEST FILM I&#039;VE EVER WATCHED WHEN HIGH!<br /><br />Dikebog

				When I&#039;m high, I can only really watch action movies.&nbsp; All those classic stoner movies like Dazed and Confused and The Wall and The Big Lebowski I just find boring, real trippy movies like The Fountain are too cerebral, and comedies I have a tendency of overthinking waaay too much and end up just thinking they&#039;re stupid.&nbsp; I guess I just like big explosions and crazy special effects. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Star Trek, Casino Royale, and especially superhero movies I can&#039;t get enough of.&nbsp; And then when I&#039;m sober I hate action movies and love everything else.
