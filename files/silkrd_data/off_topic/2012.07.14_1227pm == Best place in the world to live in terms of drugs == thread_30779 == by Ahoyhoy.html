				OK, so where is the best place to live in the world if you use drugs. Criteria include accessibility of drugs, cost, quality, legal status, risk of prosecution, culture and vibe.<br /><br />Amsterdam?<br />Madrid?<br />California?

				The Netherlands is the first place that comes to mind. Rotterdam is one of the biggest port cities in the world, so they get a lot of drug traffic flowing through there. So as far as accessibility and price, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s among the best. Rotterdam has a large university too, so lots of young people, lots of music and a very liberal culture. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get in trouble with heavier drugs, but nothing out of the ordinary. <br /><br />Canada is liberal when it comes to pot, it&#039;s always very affordable. What is also interesting is that peyote, as a plant, isn&#039;t considered illegal, because a lot of the First Nations citizens use it for spiritual practices. <br /><br />My friend is in Australia right now. Poor chump told me $50 for 3 grams of weed was a good deal. Australia is obviously at the other end of this discussion.

				I love Amsterdam and good weed (and anything else) is so easy to find in Vancouver but I&#039;d put San Fransisco (and up towards Mendocino county) close to the top of the list.&nbsp; If you have a green card Cali is as easy to score weed as it is in Amsterdam and it seems like the populace there is even more drug friendly than what I encountered in the Netherlands (but then again I&#039;m not a native).&nbsp; Granted so much of this depends upon who you know and where you go in whatever city your in.

				But seriously if you are a foreigner visiting the Dam please be real responsible. Shrooms was banned and replaced with truffles, I heard someone drowned in the canal and some went to the hospital after ingesting. No one wants another attempt to ban truffles due to some stupid mistakes.

The government has established a 30km safe zone and no-one is allowed to go deeper into that, some have returned to areas in the outer/near 30km zone where the radiation is deemed safe/not severe. You may go there if you wish, there is no law/authority preventing to do so, however the radiation is high and you might die of short-term and if lucky long-term diseases/illnesses caused by radiation. Anyone would be mad but to live there, I went to the area in my hazmat suit up till the 10km point, its an absolute disaster. I would not recommend living there. In Tokyo and other places, the radiation levels are safe/meet govt safety standards. No law-enforcement will ransack your items, however if you live near drug/crime associated places like Roppongi, Shibuya/etc you are more likely to be questioned and asked permission to search your bag. While you have the right to deny the search, it`ll be obvious you have something to hide and you may be in for trouble. Its best to stay away from places at night, you risk standing out more. <br /><br />

				I believe Portugal isn&#039;t too bad for it&#039;s drug laws.&nbsp; From the wiki:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Portugal has arguably the most liberal laws concerning possession of illicit drugs in the Western world. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including, but not limited to, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and LSD. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than &quot;10 days worth of personal use&quot; are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal&#039;s drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use rose only slightly, whilst use among teenagers dropped, along with the number of HIV infection cases, which had dropped 50% by 2009.[28][29]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

I am intrigued by the culture of Japanese, was such a peaceful place in the non-city areas. Wouldn&#039;t even dare to go there now, as drinking water from the tap is already a risk.

The tap water is not contaminated in any way. There has been no cases of reported radiation poisoning through consumption of water/food. Furthermore 60% of our foods are imported. The disaster has happened off near the ocean`s area and the melt down is under control. Of course the material is yet to be moved and disposed off safely, but it poses no threat to people outside that zone. All sources of water near the disaster site have been blocked/diverted. There is no water sold/given from those sources. The only way you can get your hands on that water is go near the powerplant, which no one does. I hope you reconsider as media sources tend to twist the truth.

I don`t think he`s ignorant, just perhaps he genuinely didn`t know what exactly is going on. I was talking to my friend over the internet and when I mentioned the earthquake/tsunami/meltdown, he had no idea about it what so ever, or the amount of people that died. While I don`t expect everyone to know details of current events, even I was surprised when I heard that from him. I was sure most would learn even without watching/reading the news.
