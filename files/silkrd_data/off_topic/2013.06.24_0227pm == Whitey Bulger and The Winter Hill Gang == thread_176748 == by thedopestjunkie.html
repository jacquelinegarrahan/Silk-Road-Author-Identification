				Has anyone else been following this case? The Feds literally knew this piece of shit was murdering people left and right and what did they do? They fucking protected him and had him murder people they wanted dead. If thats not bad enough one of his right hand murderers was paid 250,000 by the DEA and given a light sentence for murdering about twenty something people. <br />So my question is what do we learn from this? <br />Crime pays as long as you play the FEDS like the incompetent murderers they are? What do others think?

				Interesting point mc haberdasher... Im having a hard time understanding all of this though, the FEDS knew what this piece of shit was doing and they aided him. They even paid his hitman off and gave him a light sentence. For me this is just further proof that FEDS are not nearly responsible enough to wield the kind of power they are supposed to wield. And furthermore what a fucking hypocrisy that most of us will end up in prison for recreational drug use, and possibly do more time than some fucking hitman who made a deal with the FEDS. Shit is fucked up and people just seem so complacent to me these days. No one seems to mind that their tax dollars are being wasted so a few goon cops can make a quick buck. How noble. gimme a fucking break.
