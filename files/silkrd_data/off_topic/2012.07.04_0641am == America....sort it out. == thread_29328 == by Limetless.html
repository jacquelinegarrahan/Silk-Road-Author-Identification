				Why does like 95%+ of your sitcoms revolve around the family? It&#039;s fuckin boring and most of them are really cheesy and cliche. <br /><br />Also stop using canned laughter, it just annoys us Brits. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t stop doing this, can you please stop selling your shows to the British networks please. It would be very much appreciated.<br /><br />That is all. :)

				Also can you stop taking British formats, copying them and then doing so really badly. <br /><br />Examples - <br /><br />The Office<br />Peep Show<br />Other shit I can&#039;t think of yet. <br /><br />America doesn&#039;t have the same sense of humour as Britain so trying to nick our shit wont work. The American version of The Office DOESN&#039;T WORK. The American version of Peep Show IS SHIT. <br /><br />Please cease all this now before we will sue you for doing a shit job. <br /><br />That is all.

				I find these shitcoms more depressing than Jeremy Kyle, my sister watches them endlessly. All the jokes feel like they have been generated by some comedy algorithm.<br /><br />Red Dwarf for example, absolute gold here in the UK. Checkout the American pilot episode on youtube and you will get arthritis in your neck from shaking your head in disgust, its that that awful.

				I agree, the American sitcoms suck! <br /><br />The worst was America&#039;s attempt to remake Red Dwarf. We screwed that one up royally. <br /><br />So, to the Brits, Keep making the great shows like Dr. Who! Cant wait for the new season, too bad I have to download it to watch it.<br />I cant leave the Canadians out of it, Red Green and &quot;This hour has 22 min&quot; are GREAT as well.<br /><br />Any suggestions on other great British shows I should download and watch? I do love them.

				Only one not mentioned (that I&#039;m aware of) that was destroyed being Americanized was Skins. Attractive young people taking drugs? That was a fun guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Only great thing I got out of it, more so than the difference between the office because I know much more of drug culture; was it became very clear how Americans, directors, television studios affect the perception and style of a show. As in example, in the UK version of Skins a bunch of attractive teens in fucked up situations use drugs and bond and support each other and other than the shit life throws at them turn out okay. In the American version a bunch of average teens in middle class lives are exposed to drugs and it fucks them up in a downward spiral.<br /><br />I am an American, and I am sick of our bullshit.

Basically, the US makes great gangster/drug trafficking TV, British make great satirical comedy. We should both just stick to what we&#039;re good at and not be so cheap as to blatantly tax each others shows n style as it just don&#039;t work!!!!

				I dunno, if The Wire hasn&#039;t been mentioned yet it&#039;s a fine quality show. It&#039;s rather telling, but a great show was produced around the premise of a terrible system. life&#039;s funny eh?<br />Sadly a large portion of the American populace has been convinced that being pointedly stupid is a socially desirable attribute. British comedy doesn&#039;t seem to work for this as (imho) it seems to enjoy pushing outside of the box, also Brit comedy enjoys things like subtlety and isn&#039;t afraid of a slow build up in the direction of one great joke, rather than American style of bombarding viewers with a rapid multitude of luke-warm comedy.<br />But borrowing is good so we can keep sifting through the bull. :D<br /><br />-Cheers
