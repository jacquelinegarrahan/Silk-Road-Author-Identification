				I saw this item listed on SR: http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/86816e112a<br /><br />I-Doser Wiki:<br />I-Doser is an application for the playback of proprietary audio content. The developer claims the separately purchasable content aims to simulate specific mental states (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_states_of_consciousness) through the use of binaural beats (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beat), and much of it is named after prohibited (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_prohibition) recreational drugs. The I-Doser player has been downloaded more than a million times and is based on the audio technology of a GPL-licensed binaural beat generator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_brainwave_entrainment_software),.The player can be downloaded for free, but the audio content has to be purchased.<br /><br />Real man need real drugs. Did anyone made some experience or use this digital drug ? I think its bullshit.I didnt get high&nbsp; :(&nbsp; <br />Only my ears were bleeding.<br />&nbsp;<br />Just test some free Cocaine &amp; Heroin.Works good by using headphones ..<br /><br />I-Doser digital Cocaine:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpfJZMd5fzE<br /><br />I-Doser digital Heroin:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Rd504UFoQ<br />

				They sort of make me tired, but I feel it&#039;s placebo.<br />A really great song can make me more euphoric than a lot of things.<br /><br />However, the gates of hell i-doser track, or whatever it was called, literally freaked me the fuck out.<br />I dare anyone to play that as they&#039;re laying in bed.

				For the sake of experimentation, I&#039;ve acquired a number if the I-doser tracks, and I&#039;ll be doing some listening here in the near future. I&#039;ll post my findings.<br />Although I don&#039;t expect anywhere near the effects as actually tripping or rolling, I expect there may at least be a slight placebo, or perhaps even a real effect from it.<br /><br />I&#039;ll repost in maybe a day or so.

				When I first heard about these I tried them out and didn&#039;t notice anything at all really, I tried laying in bed not focusing on it like they say to do and it just does nothing for me. <br /><br />I&#039;ll stick to real drugs, you guys can have the placebo effect.<br /><br />

				It&#039;s like religion; the stronger your belief, the better the satisfaction, but you will never truly get the real deal.<br /><br />I did my fair share of research in brain function, and happened to stumble upon this (among other similar things). While the plausibility of this working hasn&#039;t really been busted, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the actual sound content what&#039;s doing the work (for those whom it actually works/worked for). <br /><br />My theory is that these sounds are composed to be nothing but a major distraction. To an extent that it can make you completely focused on nothing but the sound, which enables you to have more control over the way you want to feel (or make it easier to meditate, which is another way to put it). With much practice, and here&#039;s the catch, some of them can pretty accurately resemble the feeling of being on that particular drug. So what&#039;s happening? You&#039;ve actually trained yourself to feel that way. The music just helps with the concentration. You can make yourself feel a lot more than you might think by utilizing your inner thought. This is pretty much in the same spectrum of how the iceman (for those who don&#039;t know: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof) can control his body temperature so well.<br /><br />So pretty much any way you can feel, you can theoretically manipulate yourself into feeling without the help of any external factors. It&#039;s not the music doing the work, it&#039;s your own brain, the music is just for helping you concentrate.<br /><br />Then why are they all slightly different (the tracks)? Not because of the relevance regarding to that particular feeling, but because your brain will eventually attach the experience to the sound. That would make it pretty hard to &quot;summon&quot; different types of feelings on the exact same sound. Just helps you with distinction.<br /><br />To those whom it never worked for, this is probably why. You&#039;ve simply not found your own magical X of manipulating your experience by thought. It&#039;s easy for some, impossible for others.<br /><br />But that&#039;s just my theory.

				I had a go with about 6 tracks including LSDQH, Heroin, AMT, Cannabis. Now i have experience with some of these drugs in their real form (not with all of them), so i tried them so i would be able to compare.<br />I had literally zero effect off them. Just a bit of a headache really. They do say it wont work for everyone mind

				So what would happen if you listened to these while on the actual drug? Does it induce some crazy visuals?

Like I explained above, it&#039;s probably not going to matter which soundtrack you pick. But I guess it could add some effect (most likely mental), depending on the type of drug, due to the way these tracks work. Different sounds/rhythms for your left and right hemisphere, which is part of the &quot;science&quot; behind it, might indeed do something strange to you while on drugs. But that would not necessarily be due to the &quot;relevance&quot; of any of these tracks to that particular drug. It would be due to how these tracks are composed in general. This is best comparable to how watching some type of videoclip will be a special experience when you&#039;re on acid or mushrooms. Nothing magic happens, no.

				I think it is a scam. There are lots of free binaural beat generators you can download. I used to try to use them to have lucid dreams and shit. The i-doser website sells each &quot;drug&quot; individually for download. You can torrent them all anyways. I tried this a long time ago when I was really young and curious about drugs but didn&#039;t know where to get them. I remember not being surprised when it never worked.

Any kind of binaural beat would work for these purposes: help with concentration. The rest of the result comes from nothing but your own brain.
