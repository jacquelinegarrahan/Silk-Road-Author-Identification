				I&#039;ve been on here going on 4 months, and always kind of chuckle at the requests for small amts of btc&#039;s to complete an order...so, of COURSE I now find myself in this situation, lol!&nbsp; With bitinstant taking away the coinapult direct-to-wallet option I&#039;ve just lost my quick and easy, under an hour to fund my account system :p&nbsp; I&#039;ve opened an mtgox account, and will fund it later today, but in the meantime would be grateful if some generous soul could front 0.2 btc&#039;s to <br /><br />1JfuT5kGUSuT3z16VA5ySHMvzxB7fJPnTp<br /><br />We can make history here, as from everything I&#039;ve read on the forums about these microloans, this will be the first one that ever actually gets PAID BACK!<br /><br />I can provide vendor refs if anyone wants, feel free to pm as well, thanks very much in advance!<br />

				Sorry Micro, didn&#039;t mean to be presumptuous there, glad to hear in fact that it won&#039;t be first time someone&#039;s been repaid.&nbsp; I just saw a lot of posts about folks who hadn&#039;t been, and never one from someone who had...<br />

				Micro,<br /><br />Off topic, but just wanted to say I absolutely love and completely agree w/ your sig. Went to a rave last night and these guys were surprised when I whipped out the Mecke/Simons Reagent and showed them the stuff they were putting into their body wasn&#039;t what they thought.&nbsp; In this day and age it doesn&#039;t make any sense why people would put anything in their body without doing thorough research first...
