				Didn´t know the best place to post so will put it up here and drug safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;A while back we decided to look into the use of opium and opium derivatives in a taper down program to both manage the physical withdraws associated with ceasing heroin consumption at different levels of addiction, and also try to &quot;cure&quot; psychological addiction, breaking habits, re-evaluating lifestyle choices, analyzing factors responsible for addiction and removing the queues and causes that are personally responsible in each case. <br /><br />We work closely with an extremely reputable and knowledgeable clinician specializing in drug addiction and psychology and began our mission. Each case was worked on from scratch, we have a very basic template we apply to each customer depending on usage patterns, lifestyle, age and other factors, and then we assign and addiction level. After which we then work very closely with the customer both between the clinician and the assigned TSC mentor (currently only me, but we will expand as we see fit) . The plan is built up from the original basic guidelines and we ensure that it&nbsp; is 100% workable and understood. From there on in there are regular meetings between the health staff, mentor and client throughout the life of the program. We are currently limited as to how many customers we can take on. The healthcare fees for the consultancy are very high and we cover almost all of them to try and make the program affordable to everyone. Its very difficult to find a respected clinician that will agree to work with people completely anonymously, that has the interest in the right place and that knows what hes doing, after all he can lose his job and go to prison for medicating people with opium, for whatever the reason. We do this only to try and help other people and as said, we cover almost all of the cost, which can run into the 5 figure mark easily for a 2 month program with two meetings a week, analyzing the patients history etc etc... a lot of hours prep goes into each program. So currently we are unable to cover the cost for any more customers as we have done previously and maintain the profits for the other side of our business coming through.&nbsp; If the interest keeps going the way it is we will look into ways to subsidize the clinician costs and everything else. We don´t want this to be available only to people with money, we believe that everyone should be able to get help for their addiction whatever the cost, and if our method proves better than the current employed methods by the state we definitely dont want people to be denied that either by obtuse laws or cost. If we go live we will do everything we can short of bankrupt TSC in order to make it available to everyone lol, I guess we will try to make up the higher costs through running lottos, donations, trying to find a better deal on the doc side of things, although I really want to see him continue with us, he really is awesome. <br /><br />It really is such a shame that the government has seen fit to ban opium and declare it as a high risk category drug. For the only fact that if it were legal and everyone could have their own poppies growing in their yard, the big companies like Bayer, who pay the government huge sums to keep the laws the way they are, would lose fuckloads of cash as people would not rely on them for drugs. Everyone wins except for the people. The state keeps getting their pockets lined by the pharma companies, the pharma companies keep being allowed, legally, to financially enslave the infirm, and the infirm keep having to pay whatever price, the pharma companies, with no competition, decide to charge you for the medicine that might allow you to relieve your pain just enough for you to sleep, or keep your immune system in check allowing you to live 2 or 3 more years. You see, it works beautifully for them, what person wouldn´t pay their entire life&#039;s earnings for two years worth of a new aids drug, or cancer cure if you thought it had the chance of making you live 2 years longer, who wouldn&#039;t pay anything in exchange for their life..&nbsp; &nbsp;If we were free to use all methods at our disposal for helping mankind we would be able to help a whole load more. From the results I have seen over the last 3 weeks I honestly think this could be one of the most effective taper down drugs there is. If we were allowed to help each other with no red tape restricting us we would be able to closely monitor our clients progress, get blood tests, have the patient in for the first few weeks of the program to ensure that all goes well. We would be able to get the products they need quicker and readily available. Our health staff, mentors, and clients would not have to wear digital masks, we could really benefit from the weekly meetings, we would have to hide nothing. We would be available just one phone call away. But unfortunately its not to be, the state could care less about the people affected, and would prefer to shove the opiate replacement drug whose manufacturer bribes the best, down the&nbsp; throats of the people caused ill by the obtuse stance the state takes, &quot;illigalise everything, with no evidence, studies or common sense and then punish those who attempt to help themselves in any way that differs from what we allow&quot;<br /><br />Anyways sorry for the rambling! we´re only 3 weeks in but the results so far are very very promising. We have recently taken on our first Australian &quot;test&quot; client and will be commenting on his/her progress as we move along, but based on the past 3 weeks observations I have high hopes.<br /><br />To the point, I started this thread because I got a fair few questions over the last week about what the listing is all about and how the program works. This is the first time I have answered fully in a public manner and I think the answer explains quite a lot. <br /><br />&quot; Heya,<br />Not sure why the listing is up. Its a trial listing at the moment and not up for sale until we finish testing., We are trying to see if it works out, the aim is to provide custom taper down program catering to each persons individual needs / use patterns, etc.. its aimed at managing withdrawal symptoms and psychological dependance through the use of different kinds of opium based products. Drawing on their individual natural variations in strength, onset duration, peak type, length of duration, any comedown effects and type of buzz. Its Ideal because Opium is one of the closest opioid analgesics effects wise to heroin, the perfectly balanced blend of opiates recreates the effect to a lesser extent thus keeping the user in his/her comfort zone as much as poss.:) No one can get it more spot on than nature. The buzz being similar and thus helping psychologically wean the user off his/her heroin habit. We keep the taper down steps of the program short to minimize the addiction potential to opium itself. and keep a pretty fast taper down to a last minimal dose which is then carried on for up to a month. We provide the full package, From the one to one sessions every 3 days, to close and regular email support, counseling, emotional support. The actual substances used for the taper down are a mix of Raw opium, Laudanum, opium paste (rashasha) and the opium tea, the tea making up the staple of the program, all other substances are supplementary to it and used for very specific purposes, eg... fighting off a craving, or performance issues in your life, eg. You have a big exam coming up/ job interview/ etc.. and you cant afford to be left withdrawing unable to think, move, agitated, restless etc.. for the day. So the program includes 3 to 4 emergency pick up doses of paste. Its around the half way mark in terms of how long it takes to take effect, so its not suited to an emergency dose needed to fight off a withdrawal. but the duration of effects is high up there a bit below the tea. this makes it ideal as a planned pick me up. The whole idea of using different opium derivatives enables us to keep the taper down dosage of the tea constant. We believe it important to never fuck with taper down dose once the correct starting dose is found. if you start adding an extra couple of grams here or there in the tea mix when you wake up one day not feeling too great you will mess up the carefully calculated taper down schedule, your body wont be recieving a lower dose and even with one dose, tolerance will rise., Will power sometimes needs a bit of help and its all to easy to wake up one morn things get too hard and bang you´ve drank too much, fucked up all the good work you did up till then and tolerance has built up again. and then need to go back to square one. So the tea dose is sacred, never gets altered from the agreed amount. But if one day you find the tea lacks and your getting very uncomfortable withdrawals we offer different substances to keep your taper down bang on track but the cravings away. SO far we have run the programme with 3 users. All 3 have stuck to the appointed schedule. have not re-used heroin and are for the most part, happy optimistic and most of all healthy. The plan includes instructions for everything from daily exercise, balanced diet, recreational drug use. social habits etc..<br />So all in all, if the results keep going the way they are going we will put this listing live in a month or so.<br />There will be an initial listing that will be the flat rate consultation fee, The same price for all members, except for the Screwbies (TSCrew Members) for whom the consultation fee and end listing fee is very heavily reduced. Once the consultation fee is paid we proceed to exchange ideas and tailor make the programme for you, we include a complete schedule, not all doom and gloom. we offer a selection of recreational drugs for those users that wish to take a recreational drug once in a while during the program. We don&#039;t believe that abstinence from all drugs is a complete necessity, depending on the user of course. In fact we have found that the use of Mescaline on one out of two occasions (the one with no effect we believe was down to the set and setting, not a very good environment to trip in... not specifically very bad but not much thought had gone into the preparation), DMT on two out of two occasions and LSD on one occasion to have some apparent beneficial effect towards the intensity of cravings. There´s nothing concrete there, but the feedback we have got is pretty impressive.<br />After we have discussed the contents of the personalized plan, and you are comfortable, know the plan, its requisites, your and our expectations, start date signed and prepared for, run through the plan, social life changes etc etc.. We refer you on to our clinician, he will go through the medical history you chose to disclose with us, (please be aware you need to be open and honest for us to help you) he will go through any contra-indications, allergies, medical issues you may face, suggest anything prescription wise you might want to consider and make any changes to the plan that he feels will benefit in achieving the end target. He will monitor your progress, attend to any non critical medical issues along the way and once the plan has reached its end he will help you make a new start on the new you by suggesting and maintaining any good habits he feels you should stick to in the future, this will cover diet, exercise, medication, follow up checks with doctors, sti appointments etc... Once the med check done and we have a concrete signed plan you and your allocated staff member/mentor get to know each other in the days running up to the start date of the program and whilst the products make their way to you.<br />Let me know if that answered everything.<br />ACE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unread<br />delete<br />&quot;<br /><br />Many thanks for the read if you managed to get through that far! I realize its an essay but It serves me to point people here if they have questions in the future<br /><br />ACE!
