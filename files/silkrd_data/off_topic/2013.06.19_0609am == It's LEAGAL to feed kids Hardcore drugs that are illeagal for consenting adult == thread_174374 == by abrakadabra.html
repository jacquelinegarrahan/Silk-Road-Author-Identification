				&nbsp;Here in the grand old USA our normal common method used to deal with the children that are a &quot;challenge&quot; for our education system is to feed them large doses of speed. That&#039;s right, speed, meth or amphetamine is fed to literally MILLIONS of unwilling children simply because the schools don&#039;t want to handle anyone with behavior outside the &quot;normal&quot;.<br />&nbsp;I think it might be better to educate the&nbsp; educators a little better and let our youth grow up and make their own decisions as to what drugs they do or do not want to use.<br />&nbsp;If we are going to feed it to our youth, is it fair to one day stop feeding it to them and force our young adults into a life having to spend tens of thousands of dollars per year to &quot;illegally&quot; obtain the substance YOU FED THEM SINCE CHILDHOOD unwillingly? <br />&nbsp; I did not want anything to do with the meth back when my school &quot;guidance&quot; counselors and teachers sat me and my mom down in a meeting and pleaded for me to try the meth, which BTW wasn&#039;t disclosed to me or my parents that the pills they wanted to feed me was speed.<br />&nbsp; My problem was NEVER a &quot;disorder&quot; or &quot;disease&quot; and in fact my problem wasn&#039;t that I couldn&#039;t learn or didn&#039;t pay attention. I was tested and determined to be a &quot;genius&quot; at an early age with a high IQ and I always tested well and learned faster then everyone else but I was more interested in the &quot;social&quot; experience at school and not concerned with the busy work the teachers would give..<br />&nbsp; My school had a program where the kids the teachers considered a PITA were put together in special classes but my high IQ kept me from qualifying for that. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I was never real bad in class but always wanted to be funny and some teachers didnt know how to handle kids like me. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;So in the later years of high school they finally convinced my parents to try the drugs and my mom begged me to just try and see if it helps.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;From the instant I dropped the first pill I was hooked on speed, provided by the local pharmacy for years until one of the required yearly visits to my family physician he decided to stop feeding me the meth.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;That was a tough thing to have to handle and I slept for weeks until I found someone else willing to sell me his extra amphetamine salts his doc gave him. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I found out that crystal meth was the same thing as what my doc gave me, only not as good as his but I spent $$$$ obtaining my fix illegally ever since.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If I am caught in possession of my meds, the authority figures who once fed me these substances as a child can forcefully abduct me and force me into a cage by force which is basically what getting arrested is.<br />&nbsp; Why feed addictive substances to children that consenting adults who are fully aware of the risks and consequences involved cannot obtain, possess or consume legally? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yea I am aware of that but the difference in effect is minimal at best and the only obtainable solution when they discontinue the prescription is street meth which is less potent compared to the 60mg I was given. seems less consistent and very easy to become tolerant to a batch. I&#039;ve been a daily meth user for over 10years now and in that time I have spent enough to buy several homes I am sure. <br />&nbsp; If you think it&#039;s that fucking different and we should feed it to the kids while meth is considered criminal substance for a consenting adult to even touch, then feed it to your kids if you can have any.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Look at it like this, <br />&nbsp;The propaganda presented to the public tends to demonize the non taxed street meth they decided to criminalize for consenting adults to buy, sell, consume or even possess or obtain precursors while the propaganda seems to describe the meth we feed millions of children daily in a much nicer picture.

I&#039;m not 100% sure, but I&#039;m fairly sure that per mg, methamphetamine is more potent than amphetamine in the stimulation is produces, but the euphoria induced by the drug is more than the increase in stimulation. if that makes sense. Example: Amphetamine has a stimulation rating of 100. A euphoria rating of 100. methamphetamine has a stimulation rating of 200 and a euphoria rating of 300. Do you get what I mean? They all produce stimulant effects, but amphetamine would be better than meth for concentrating on school work. Try working on cocaine. The euphoria is too good to work. You just wanna have fun.

				&nbsp;well it is an amphetamine on a urine analysis, though that means little. This is a pointless argument. I may have oversimplified the classification to a degree but the point of the actual topic is still valid since we feed millions of kids powerful stimulants, amphetamines to some and similar powerful stimulants with different trade names and alternative chemistry to others.&nbsp; I think if we can force stimulants on kids it is unfair that a consenting adult can not chose what they wish to consume.<br />&nbsp;If my school guidance counselors and teachers had not made their misdiagnosis and convinced my parents to drug me, my life may have been very different. Maybe better, maybe worse but still would have saved me a few hundred grand.

				Don&#039;t try to blame being a meth addict on being prescribed Ritalin as a child.&nbsp; We don&#039;t judge and we don&#039;t care.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never known or met a meth addict that became a meth addict because of Ritalin.&nbsp; Ritalin isn&#039;t an amphetamine.&nbsp; Ritalin is weak.&nbsp; Meth is strong.&nbsp; They are different.&nbsp; Sorry to break it to you pal but you started doing meth for whatever reason that we do not know but it has nothing to do with you being prescribed Ritalin as a child.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s weird you have an easier time getting off meth than you do getting off Ritalin.. Ritalin is a lot less addictive than meth. I agree with you though that stimulants are overprescribed to children that don&#039;t even have ADD/ADHD.

I could stay awake for a week and a half with ease, now I can&#039;t do 2 days without passing the fuck out even with loads of meth in me.
