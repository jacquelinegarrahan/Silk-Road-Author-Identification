				Title: <strong>&quot;The Human Experiment&quot;- WTF?</strong><br />

				So yeah, I stumbled across the onion site by the name of &quot;The Human Experiment&quot;, and I&#039;m very disturbed, to be quite honest...<br /><br />To make a long story short... This onion site is a site that documents extremely deranged experiments they run on various homeless people they abduct and hold captive in one of 4 warehouses they have. Judging by the proficient English used by the author(s), I&#039;m assuming these people are either in the US, Canada, or UK.<br /><br />To make it even more deranged, it is a team of Registered Nurses, Student Doctors, and Resident Doctors. Or so they say proclaim...<br /><br />Among the experiments documented are submerging people into near-freezing water just to see how long they last before dying. There is also the experiment where they inject bleach into pregnant subjects&#039; wombs to see how long it takes for the fetus to abort.<br /><br />Fucked up, I know...<br /><br />Besides the obvious, I&#039;m disturbed by the fact that these people even made this site. Why would anyone want to read about this shit? I think the word &quot;experiment&quot; is a grandiose coining of what they are doing. It is merely torture and pleasure killing.<br /><br />Now, if they want to do this shit on their own time, I would prefer they didn&#039;t, but is there really a need to document and post it to an onion site? This is a VERY great reason for LE to attempt even harder to crack the Tor technology aside from wanting to catch the &quot;evil&quot; drug dealers. It&#039;s always the idiots who ruin it for everyone else, and this is a great example of that. Personally, I want these sadistic fucks to be hung out to dry, but I don&#039;t want LE to crack Tor technology in the process. And, if I were a cop who actually cared about protecting people, I wouldn&#039;t stop until I tracked these fuckers down.<br /><br />What do you guys think? I think this is the type of shit that&#039;s going to ruin for people like us who just want to buy drugs and harm ourselves. I think these people deserve the electric chair, but if a lot of these types of onion sites make their way to popularity, it&#039;s only a matter of time before some whitehat hacker working for LE cracks the technology in the name of catching these sadistic bastards. We all know what happens next.<br /><br />So, yeah, do you guys approve of onion sites like this existing? I know Tor is thought to be un-crackable, but nothing&#039;s impossible. Do you think it endangers people who merely want to harm themselves and nobody else via buying drugs? Do you think these fucks should get the electric chair?<br /><br />Or, am I just overreacting? Personally, I really don&#039;t even have an issue with contract killers posting sites to sell their services, but I see no merit at all in torturing people, calling it an &quot;experiment&quot;, and posting the results to an onion site, effectively endangering other users who have no desire to harm anyone but themselves...<br /><br />P.S.- Don&#039;t even ask me for the URL, I refuse to advertise for these scumbags. If you search hard enough, you can probably find it yourself, anyhow.

The site has been made in very basic blog software.&nbsp; It hasn&#039;t been updated since just after it was created, in July 2011.<br /><br />2. The entire thing is riddled with grammar and spelling errors and errors in medical terminology.&nbsp; It is written in a very childish way.&nbsp; It most certainly was not written by a medical professional with a university education as the site claims all participants to be.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; The &#039;freezing&#039; experiments are a direct copy of those you can find on the Wikipedia page for Nazi experiments, with the numbers rejigged slightly.<br /><br />4. The other experiments (injecting bleach into a foetus) have no medical or research value at all.&nbsp; Compare this with the Nazi experiments which, whilst vile, did have medical research value.&nbsp; As the professionals arguing this page were saying: there&#039;s far more interesting things you could do in such an environment.<br /><br />Of course it&#039;s possible that there are mad scientists out there conducting experiments on homeless people, but... Occam&#039;s Razor, my friend. :)

				The beauty of Tor is also it&#039;s curse. Because it is decentralized, nobody can regulate to what end it is used.<br /><br />That said, I am quite sure this is fake. I think somebody wanted to write his own horror movie plot. You can buy the most horrible horror movies on DVD, and some artists make real twisted art. Why is this any different?<br /><br />Also, they could have done a better job. If they got a professional photographer, a few actors and a good Hollywood make-up artist, then they could make it look awfully realistic. I&#039;d sit back and watch the mayhem. Could be fun.
