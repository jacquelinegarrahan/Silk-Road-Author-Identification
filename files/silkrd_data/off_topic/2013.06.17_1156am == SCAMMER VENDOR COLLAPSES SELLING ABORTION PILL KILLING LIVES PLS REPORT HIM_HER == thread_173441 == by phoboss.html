If fetuses are morally equal to adult humans, you can&#039;t just stand by and let other people make their own choices to kill a human.<br /><br />It would be like saying, hey, you believe murder is wrong, but this group of people over here disagrees. So, just don&#039;t buy guns and shoot them at people, but let this group make their own choices (they are fond of shooting people).<br /><br />The logic of getting into other people&#039;s business and trying to stop abortion is sound, as long as you accept the premise that fetuses are morally equal to adult humans. Of course, the premise is wrong.<br />

Morals are entirely subjective, meaning that &#039;right and wrong&#039; is entirely subjective. If I were to disagree with heroin being sold, for instance, because I&#039;ve seen the effects of its misuse/abuse does that mean that nobody else should have access to it? The &quot;I disagree with something so it shouldn&#039;t be allowed&quot; mentality has absolutely no place in a libertarian community. You have the right to espouse such views, of course, but they conflict with the very same freedoms that you yourself enjoy here - the right to personal choice without interference from the moral views of others being the main one.<br /><br />Libertas
