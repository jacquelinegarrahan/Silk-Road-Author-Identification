				Hi there,<br /><br />i will be visiting Amsterdam from 13.07 - 19.07 with my Lady. Friday and&amp;or Saturday we will have a look at the Amsterdam Bass Festival.<br />Also i have a nice stash of Bing and Mdma I don`t want to traffic something into the netherlands. Smuggling personal stash INTO the Netherlands sounds idiotic for me.<br /><br />Can someone with some Info jump in for me and get me some hints for where to get some decent bing in Amsterdam. Infos on nice electro clubs besides the bass festival are also very appreciated.<br /><br />Maybe someone is also going out to the festival or something like that.<br /><br />If you want to you can of course drop me a pm also !<br /><br />Help is very appreciated !<br /><br />Greetings from Germany...<br />&nbsp;

				go away. <br /><br />The IRL advice requests are getting old, if you have made it here at this point, you probably will be able to make your way around in a large drug hub and find something. <br />Thinking helps too.<br /><br />Arrrg<br /><br />-Cheers.

While I think meeting up IRL is probably a bad idea, and I wouldn&#039;t expect anybody to actually contact the OP about getting drugs, I don&#039;t think that being able to buy drugs on SR will at all prepare him for sourcing drugs in the Netherlands. I certainly wouldn&#039;t have any idea how to find drugs anywhere besides my own town simply because I just don&#039;t know anybody there.<br /><br />If I were you, OP, I personally would probably smuggle them in myself. Here are two ideas you might want to consider:<br /><br />1. Contact the hotel ahead of time and see if you can ship yourself some packages for when you arrive. As long as you only ship a small amount and put it in with a lot of other legitimate items, you will probably be okay. This is assuming they let you ship something there, though.<br /><br />2. Put the powders inside capsules and hide them somewhere. If you have an Adderall prescription, putting it inside Adderall capsules is probably really your best bet. Otherwise, you could probably put some of them in a B-Vitamin capsule container. I took a capsule of B-Vitamins (legitimate vitamins; I didn&#039;t smuggle anything) with me on an international trip, and while they did a complete search of my person and both of my bags, they didn&#039;t actually check what was inside the capsules (that would be impractical, no?). <br /><br />Or you could just stay sober in Amsterdam. You&#039;ll most certainly be able to find weed up there (though I hear those places are getting less friendly to foreigners), and while the drugs will certainly make it more fun, you can still have fun without them.<br /><br />Whatever you choose, I wish you the best of luck, adrenalin80.<br /><br />TorDemon

				@ppass:<br />Of course i will be able to source something as i was always everywhere in the last decade of drug use, but theres nothing better then some protips from locals who know their place the best to get quality stuff and not some street bunk as there is no time to test different connections and then stick to the best. <br />Overstressed and underfucked ? Get yourself a beer ! :-)<br /><br />@TorDemon: <br />If i would take my stuff with me i wont need to hide it very secure because im going there by car from Germany. In this direction there wont be many controls. From NL to GER is another story :-)<br />I am not afraid of being catched. Done this several times but i just think its idiotic to take my stuff with me because in NL should be lots of interesting stuff available to try out ! Its like taking wood with you into the forest. :-)<br /><br />But thanks for your kind tips !

				So we are home again.<br /><br />Scoring was easy and the coke was definitely worth the 50 bucks. <br /><br />Amsterdam is a great place. If you get there be sure to take a late evening 90 minutes canal cruise with your girl. She was very grateful. :-) <br />Beside that there are hundreds of other lovely things to do and see.<br /><br />But nothings better than home :-)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				you could place an order on silk road and have it delivered to your hotel.&nbsp; i know thats not ideal, but its not a giant risk.&nbsp; or you could see about renting a mailbox somewhere in the city for a month or whatever the minimum is.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather spend money on a mailbox then try to smuggle drugs through customs myself.<br /><br />if amsterdam is still even remotely like it was when i was there, its pretty fuckin easy to get drugs, especially if you look &quot;cool&quot;<br /><br />go to a club and you&#039;re bound to get offered ecstasy and coke within 30 minutes of being there.&nbsp; or if you&#039;re desperate head over to the red light district and talk to the big black dude standing on the bridge looking sketchy...i personally wouldn&#039;t try that one, though.<br /><br />seriously though, i was only there a few days but had many opportunities to score hard drugs.&nbsp; once in broad daylight some dude walked by me real quick and just said &quot;I have ecstasy!&quot; when i said &#039;no thanks&#039; he kept his pace and his smile and just said &quot;Good stuff, yeah!&quot;&nbsp; it was cute.
