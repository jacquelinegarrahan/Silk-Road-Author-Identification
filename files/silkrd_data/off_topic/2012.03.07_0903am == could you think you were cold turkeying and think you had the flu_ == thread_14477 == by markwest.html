				im curious to know your thoughts. would it be possible to inject someone with heroin, without their knowledge, then have them cold turkey and them just think they were ill? <br /><br />im NOT PLANNING TO DOSE ANYONE. im just curious whether people think that a craving like that, which didnt have any mental association with the drug would just feel like an illness.

				That&#039;s a weird thing to wonder, but benign curiosity is always welcome.<br />One dose of heroin would not lead to the massive withdrawal sickness that you&#039;re imagining.&nbsp; Someone has to actually be addicted to something before they can quit cold turkey.&nbsp; Assuming this individual didn&#039;t even notice suddenly becoming high as fuck, the comedown would probably be equally unnoticeable to them.

				the question came to me after reminiscing on some particularly bad hangovers/comedowns ive had combined with reading shit on here. i sort of felt a bit weird about asking it, especially after reading the requests for poison and human eggs, i really dont want to group myself with them

				They would notice being high off their ass on heroin I think and also withdrawals are not that bad. Amitriptyline causes effects that feel like flu in a lot of people. Scopolomaine and DPH could give that delirious/drowsy feeling that is probably close enough.

				Withdrawals are not that bad?! What are you talking about, it certainly does not sound like you have ever withdrawn from opiates before. Low doses of anti-cholinergics definitely do not feel like heroin withdrawal either...<br /><br />Anyone who thinks &quot;feel like the flu&quot; and &quot;delirious/drowsy feeling&quot; adequately and accurately describe opiate withdrawal honestly was never actually physically dependent on opiates. <br /><br />Being dope sick is literally living hell, there is little else one can experience as physically and mentally fucked up and unbearably horrible. And I only have a low to moderate tolerance. <br /><br />The only benefit of the person not realizing they have taken the drug is that they will not associate any external stimuli with drug seeking, so essentially they wont have the intense psychological cravings. They will however still experience all the physical symptoms down regulation of receptors will cause including muscle aches and spasms, gastrointestinal distress, pain everywhere, anxiety, high blood pressure, yawning and watery eyes, runny nose, worse fucking restless leg ever, sweating and freezing and burning up all simultaneously, unable to sleep yet exhausted, unable to eat or drink yet dying of dehydration, kicking at night, panic attacks, sense of smell like hundred times too intense and every aroma worsens the nausea, plus crazy depression... but fortunately theyd have it easy cause their only thought isnt finding more drug and using it.
