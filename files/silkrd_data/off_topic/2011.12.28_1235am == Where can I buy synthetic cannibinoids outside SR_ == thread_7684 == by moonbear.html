				I&#039;m looking for a place to buy research chemicals with a good selection of cannabinoids so I can make a nice smoke blend. I need to find a reliable place to buy small quantities of these, and was hoping someone might know where I could find some?

				I have used buy-jwh.com in the past with success. best prices I could find, and quality seems to be good. they only sell &#039;legal&#039; chemicals.

They&#039;re still selling jwh-018 which is banned. I heard that any site offering banned chems are usually scams.

				If you are looking for a banned chem outside of silk road or a underground site it is 99% likely its a scam or LE lol vendors like buy-jwh and others do NOT carry banned items maybe what they have left they are getting rid of before a ban takes place but they do not restock them nor want to carry them for obvious reasons. If you are still looking for some PM me what cannabinoids and I would be kind enough to give you a few sites :)
