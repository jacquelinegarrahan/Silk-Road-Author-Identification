				As more and more vendors are requiring new and/or international buyers to finalize the transaction before sending their orders I can&#039;t understand why people feel the need to leave feedback straight away which more often than not simply says something along the lines of &quot;Finalizing early, as requested&quot;, etc.<br /><br />There is no need to leave feedback until you actually receive your order. Just finalize it as requested and then leave the order sitting on your order page until you get your package.<br /><br />I&#039;ve had to finalize early a lot lately because my country is on the shit-list but I&#039;ve never considered submitting feedback until I have my order in my hands.<br /><br />In my opinion, it kind of defeats the purpose of the whole feedback system. To me the feedback is a rating that you give the vendor based on all aspects of the transaction and can only be judged properly after you receive your product. Some of these aspects include customer relations, packaging quality, product quality, delivery speed, receiving what you actually ordered, possible discrepancies between what was advertised and what you received, bonuses that the vendor may include, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure many vendors deserve top marks but by immediately giving a 5/5 after finalizing early really doesn&#039;t give potential buyers any clue as to what to expect from a vendor.

				You bring up a good point. But to people&#039;s defense, some edit their feedback after the product arrives. Others probably just don&#039;t realize you don&#039;t have to necessarily leave feedback when finalizing early.<br /><br />

				When you&#039;re dealing with someone trustworthy that you&#039;ve already dealt with before, finalizing early is just common courtesy. If you&#039;re dealing with a trusted vendor, why not let them get their part of the deal once your order is out? <br /><br />All-in-all, feedback is always editable and if you&#039;re doing business with someone trustworthy and you have a problem, they&#039;ll make it up to keep their name alive<br /><br />-DF<br />drugfather
