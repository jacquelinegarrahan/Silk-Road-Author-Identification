				Sniff it, unless it has apap then swallow it. Ive tried smoking oxy, and honestly to me its a waste. If i had a shit ton of 30mg oxys i might smoke one or two just to mix it up, but snorting is def the way to go with oxy IMO.

				Well, I have some tonic water and am getting a 20mg oxy. My usual dose orally is upwards from 100mg, with the tonic water. Will sniffing it really do anything? If my choice is a 5 minute high or nothing, I&#039;ll take the 5 minutes, yknow?<br /><br />How much stronger is sniffing than taking orally, as a percent? Thanks for your advice

				This depends largely on the form of Oxy that you are getting.&nbsp; Instant release or Exteneded?&nbsp; The difference here can be told in the pill labeling.&nbsp; All ER (and brand name is always OxyContin) pills are marked OP in the USA, and they cannot be smoked or snorted due to a gelling agent that was put in place to discourage illlicit use...they will literally clog up your nose.&nbsp; If there is no marking for some reason, the consistancy of the pill will be like wax vs powder when crushed.<br /><br />There is a method of making the OP pills snortable though, I have had mixed results.&nbsp; Basically, grind the pill up into a fine mesh, then microwave on a plate until all the powder has turned brown.&nbsp; &nbsp;Take out, stick in the freezer, then pull out and scrpe off the resulting charred stuff.<br /><br />If 100MG isnt having any effect orally, then 20mg isnt going to do much snorted...but may just be your best bet.

				Its oxycontin extended release &quot;original formula&quot; supposed to be the crushable kind. At this point I&#039;m thinking I&#039;ll just smoke it, but your saying it wont smoke right?

				oxycodone is a strange compound in that oral bioavailability is actually much better than intranasal. i&#039;ve heard oral BA to range anywhere from 60-80%<br /><br />if banging&#039;s not an option, and you aren&#039;t fiending for that taste in the back of your nostril, i recommend orally every time. if it is an original formulation OC it certainly can be smoked, but smoking pills is always a waste IMO. they weren&#039;t designed to be ingested that way and a great deal is lost in the process. <br /><br />it&#039;s really a matter of preference, but if you want the most bang for your buck without rigs, oral is my go to route
