				Am I the only person who thinks watching some take a relatively small dose of MDMA would be extremely boring?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong - I enjoy MDMA occasionally but people using the drug are only interesting to others using the drug. To almost anyone else they sound distinctly like they are talking a load of shite, and talking it in high volumes for extended periods&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />If Nutt wants to study MDMA, he should study it thoroughly and scientifically. Not as some pointless spectacle on Channel 4. What could we possibly learn from seeing someone&#039;s pupils get larger and hearing them say how perfect the world is? He seems to do things just to try and shock the normals.<br />If they are using an MRI machine to image people&#039;s brains, that is even more boring! A man lying in a tube for 2 hours? ::)<br /><br />To be honest I didn&#039;t read the article, but &quot;people taking MDMA on tv&quot;.

				Holy fuck...&nbsp; a guy actually telling the truth. <br /><br />It&#039;s funny how out of touch the other interviewee is. &quot;It&#039;s sending the wrong message to young people&quot;<br /><br />These people need to realise that no-one gives a fuck what message they&#039;re sending out. Drugs are already vilified endlessly in the media and they&#039;re a massive part of youth culture, absolutely fucking massive. Young people just don&#039;t give a shit what the media says, if its known to be fun/feel good and doesn&#039;t kill you, they&#039;ll take it. Simple as that. <br /><br />If these people really want young people to listen and not just dismiss everything they have to say, they&#039;re going to have to start telling the truth. For example if I heard a mainstream politician say, &quot;If you take a sensible dose of good quality MDMA and don&#039;t over do it, hydrate properly but not excessively, it is actually quite benign and you will probably have a good experience, followed possibly by a comedown&quot;.. I&#039;d think FINALLY, ok, this guy has integrity, and can possibly be trusted on other things. <br /><br />@Lawnmower - the article says that they&#039;re using advanced neuroscientific techiques and the results are being published in learned journals. So whilst it is a spectacle I think the science is the main thing

				To be honest I didn&#039;t read the article, but &quot;people taking MDMA on tv&quot;.<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Well perhaps if you read the article I&#039;d be more inclined to give a flying fuck what your opinion of it is, do you even know who David Nutt is? It would appear not as you patronisingly suggested maybe he should do a scientific study, he has, on a number of drugs, that was his fucking job, for years.<br /><br />Tool.

				Come on, is there really a need to be so mean&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I know exactly who David Nutt is and what he does. While the things he says are true, I just get the feeling that he says them for the wrong reasons. Most of the time he just seems to want to infuriate the right-wing press......... <br /><br />What &quot;advanced neuroscientific techniques&quot; could possibly be interesting to watch on TV? Science tends to be a long, tedious process. TV is usually the opposite. <br /><br />What I mean is that I can&#039;t imagine how it could be both interesting viewing AND scientific. <br /><br />And I did read the article, kind of. It was boring me though. Arguments about drugs usually do, like arguments about who&#039;s God is the real God.

				Sorry if you think I&#039;m being mean, I got the impression you hadn&#039;t read the article as that&#039;s what you said, (shall I quote you a second time?) I really don&#039;t get what your problem is, if you don&#039;t think it&#039;s entertaining viewing don&#039;t watch it. Since when has it been a bad thing to infuriate the right wing press? And if Nutt&#039;s right what&#039;s your problem with this?<br />

				David Nutt destroyed that silly woman. I think the prejudice is the most important part of this show being aired. So much of the public is misinformed and this is a chance to change that.<br /><br />Getting the popcorn and 2C-B ready 8)

				Very much looking forward to watching this. David Nutt was fired because he was honest and told the TRUTH about the relative harms of drugs. Shows what our government is really like, ay.

				Been waiting for this show for AGES! Gonna make the girlfriend watch it, hopefully it will undo some of the media brainwashing . I think she thinks when we do MDMA we immediately run out into the street and start punching old women or something.<br /><br />Wednesday, 10pm channel 4.

				Nutter was on Radio 4 last week giving a 30 minute interview. He knows his shit. Funny listening to him talk about their &quot;experiments&quot;...<br /><br />IE: Getting totally shit faced on Lithium.<br /><br />Well worth a listen on iPlayer if you can get it.
