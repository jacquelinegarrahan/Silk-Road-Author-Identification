				I dont even know how I ended up there, but I found this page:<br />http://www.topix.com/forum/drug/xanax<br /><br />It appears to be meant as a discussion forum, but the majority of posts are people openly selling xanax. No code words or anything. Last I heard Xanax was a prescription drug. How is this page on the surface web and not being taken down by the man in like 2 seconds?

				Most of the people on there are scammers but I&#039;ve had a few good f2f hookups for weed and K before. I imagine there&#039;s a heavy LE presence.

				OT, but wowsers, who is that chick your avatar? She reminds me of that 90s actress who was related to a famous writer and had the same last name as him. And I think she came out that she was gay. But I cant for the life of my remember the name. Even if that isn&#039;t her pic, it&#039;s driving me totally insane trying to remember the name now.

				Have ordered successfully from there before - just gotta find the vendors with real feedback. I&#039;m much more confident when ordering from SR though. Topix at least haven&#039;t taken it down because they probably make a lot of money from the adverts. LE haven&#039;t taken it down probably because it accounts for a very small percentage of the drug market and Topix have most likely told them they&#039;ll take down any offending threads/posts (which they rarely do).

				Haha yeah, GTA&#039;s where I got it from.<br /><br />Generally go for the threads with the most replies and check through the pages for the feedback. If the feedback is consistently good and written by long term members then you can be fairly sure it&#039;s legit. Google any details of the seller before purchasing to be sure he hasn&#039;t scammed before.
