				I look through SR regularly and see so many different drugs available and often wonder which other options I may enjoy. My usual is coke and the once in a while MDMA. I am not into hallucinogens or downers. Based on that what else would you recommend and what should I expect?<br />Thanks for your time and LONG LIVE SR!!!<br />

				i hate mxe.. if i wanted to feel extreemly impared il drink alcohol, at least il have fun..<br /><br />if you like uppers only there are MANY chems for you, but none will be as magical as MDMA, how can you say u dont like halucinogens? in my experience halucinogens can be soooo much better..<br /><br />just research a bit, the list of uppers is way to long to start listing them

				My favorite is G.&nbsp; &nbsp;The buzz is much closer to alcohol, but with a bit of the body buzz and empathy of coke or e.&nbsp; It is also a &quot;chatty&quot; drug.&nbsp; It can give a little bit of energy, but it is not speedy like coke / e.&nbsp; &nbsp;Figuring out dosage is tricky which i think is the main reason that it&#039;s not more popular/common, but jiust takes a little bit of intelligence and patience. It is also the best come-down buddy for pretty much anything. Finally, it is pretty short duration (~i hr) which makes it low commitment / easy to manage your evening.<br /><br />Good luck, have fun, and be safe exploring!

				MXE is just a shitty version of ketamine thats impossible to hole on... I seriously don&#039;t understand what the hype is all about. I just flushed a gram down the toilet.<br /><br />LSD is the best drug there is hands down.<br />GHB and ketamine are also some favorites that have little or no negative effects unless you seriously overuse them.<br /><br />Addictive stims and opis are just asking for trouble. Looks like you have narrowed your options being that you don&#039;t like hallucinogens or downers... There isn&#039;t much else other than stims when you put it that way. I would seriously give LSD a shot if I were you though.

				Yeah, if you&#039;ve taken E, why stop there by limiting yourself from hallucinogens?<br />LSD is the stuff, and you don&#039;t HAVE to swallow 3 hits and blow your mind.&nbsp; Just take one, go to a club or relax in your home, and enjoy the ride!

				Ketamine, methylone maybe?&nbsp; Could always try mixing things up as well, maybe you might like some downers or hallucinogenics within the context of some coke or molly.&nbsp; Just make sure to start out with a mild dose and go from there, since it&#039;s hard to judge how much is &quot;too much&quot; when you start mixing and matching.<br /><br />I can totally understand not liking hallucinogens, personally.&nbsp; They generally last a long ass time, and I hardly have the time to be out of my mind for a whole night and most of the morning, and then be mentally and physically exhausted for the rest of the day.&nbsp; And just thinking about that ruins the whole experience for me.&nbsp; I can&#039;t enjoy it because I&#039;m dreading the next day.&nbsp; And the novelty is pretty much gone at this point, so there&#039;s really nothing to distract me from those dark thoughts.&nbsp; So yeah, not really planning on tripping anytime soon.&nbsp;

				If you really don&#039;t like psychedelics or downers you are only limiting yourself to stimulants.<br />I&#039;d say:<br />Methylone<br />4-FA<br />Mephedrone

				You said you don&#039;t like psychadelics, but my personal favorites are good ol&#039; LSD and Mushrooms. On some MXE right now which is quite the pleasant experience.
