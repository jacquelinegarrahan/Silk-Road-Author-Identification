				It&#039;s a very hard question to answer, but in short there are a couple of levels of high dependent on dose.<br />So generally 10-30mg is, at least within the people I know regarded as a low dose, high doses can be as little as 30mg in some users though but most &#039;break-through&#039; with a 50mg dose.<br />With low dosages it will resemble a typical psychedelic trip OEVs and with me anyway very distinguishable DMT CEVs.&nbsp; <br />With any sized dose there&#039;s an intense rush that feels something like a plane taking off/ shot out of something vibe.<br />With a &#039;break-through dose&#039; upon smoke exhalation you will be almost instantly taken to your own world where you could see anything.<br />&nbsp;<br />3 tips: <br />Hold the smoke in as long as you can this will be the biggest variable with reasons the same dose doesn&#039;t feel the same.<br />Find or research a decent smoking method for DMT.&nbsp; <br />Direct flame to the DMT can also ruin it a bit.<br /><br />The whole experience is very life changing.<br />I reckon you might see benefit for all that pent-up anger posting. =)

				A lot of different I can say. In all. Duration (very shorter), effect (massively stronger) and the most difficult part is to take it.<br />I had to burn 6 doses in order to find out the technique to use it. I am doing the machine method.<br /><br />Take your time to find out how to take it before you try it, otherwise you will waste a lot of dmt and nothing will happen...<br /><br />Good luck my friend!<br /><br />Adamiz<br />&nbsp;

				Definitely learn how to smoke it, I was reckless and tried to when I was drunk and ended up wasting a dose.

				In short, No. Its absolutely nothing like either one (atleast in my 40+ breakthrough experiences with it 8) )<br /><br />I did 4 hits of acid once and basically saw rainbows of colors radiating off everything in the room and couldn&#039;t speak, move, or think clearly for several hours.<br /><br />I did 15g of shrooms once and temporarily lost my mind, forgot who I was, and saw the entire world spinning and the floors moving right before my eyes.<br /><br />Then I did DMT and I was shot into a big empty room full of hundreds of faceless people dancing while the walls, floor and ceiling all changed colors. Then I appeared on the top of a mountain above the clouds and slid down the mountain watching various animals slide down with me. In my most recent experience (3 days ago) I saw a large green cyclops holding a spinning globe which looked like earth while squares and triangles of all different colors started spewing out of floor.<br /><br />In every single breakthrough experience, I have actually believed I was there and fucking LOVED everything I saw, all the different people, shapes and extremely vibrant colors. Whereas with shrooms and acid I just sit there watching things morph, move and change. Perfectly aware of where I am and whats going on.<br /><br />Medium doses of DMT give fractal/morphing visions similar to a hit or two of acid which is nice. But if you&#039;re doing DMT then dont waste it and not do a breakthrough, its pointless in my opinion&nbsp; :P

				depending on the purity of the dmt, method of delivery &amp; set n setting, it can feel like nothing but inhaling fiery mothballs,feeling so stoned that a giant is sitting on your chest with all visable lines waving and wobbling and churning to inhaling tasteless vapour watching your current reality melt and rocketing through a tunnel of light full of strange geometric shapes, encountering mystical beings; all within 10 minutes.<br /><br />Fascinating stuff DMT.

				Isn&#039;t it more of a dissociative than a psychedelic? Would Salvia Divinorum be a better comparison?

				I used to take lsd all the time back in the day when I was younger then I had a bad trip, but I figured it was cause I got a bad hit or cause of my surroundings so I tried it again and had another bad trip that was even worse than the first one, so I decided to try it one more time and guess what another bad trip so I been scared to take it ever since.&nbsp; I decided to try shrooms down the road about ten years later because friends said it was different than acid,lcd- well fuck me I had another bad trip again just this time off shrooms so I been scared to take any type of physcadelic drug since.&nbsp; I have been wanting to try dmt for awhile now but scared because of the past experiences with acid.&nbsp; Do you think I would have a bad trip if I took DMT.

My &#039;breakthrough&#039; was simply passing out. Sub-breakthrough dosages just give visuals sort of like high dose shrooms or acid, but different. More intense body high also. Ten hits of acid was way more intense imo... Ill try combining it with lsd, maybe then I wont simply pass out? I was so dissapointed when that happened.

				Is DMT similar to Sally D? For me SD is one of the most fucked up drugs i&#039;ve taken. Thought i&#039;d turned into the bong i&#039;d just used to smoke it in, lol!!&nbsp; :)<br />Sounds similar to DMT in that you temporarily have no idea where/what/who you are. SD is over very quickly however, don&#039;t know bought DMT. Considered buying some Yopo seeds once, but I don&#039;t think dissociatives will ever be my thing.
