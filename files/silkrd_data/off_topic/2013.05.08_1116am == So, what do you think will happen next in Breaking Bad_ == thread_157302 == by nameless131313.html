				Its hard to say but i have a feeling that walt is going not going to make it, think he may get too big for his boots and its going to get him killed! Also i think that jesse is going to discover what walt did to that birds son and it could even be jesse that kills walt, or walt could kill jesse.... so many possibilities i just cant wait for it to come back so i can find out! shame to see it coming to an end tho!

				I posted some theories already but i&#039;ll put them here too, these are some ideas floating around.&nbsp; This show has used lots of foreshadowing before so some ideas floating around are... <br /><br />Hank will shoot himself in the head, Holly (the baby) will die, maybe from drowning in their pool, Walt will strangle Skyler.&nbsp; Marie will be the one to turn Walt in, or make Hank do it. Holly dying is one of the most believed but i think that&#039;s really sad so i hope not.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;m pretty sure the next episode will start straight away (so with Hank on the toilet :D) as all the other cliffhangers have.&nbsp; I read that the 2nd last episode may be called &quot;Fifty Two&quot; as in the age Walt made with his bacon in the diner, so we might not see why he was buying that gun until a few episodes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think Jane (Jessies girlfriend) will come into it and I think he will find out about how she died and maybe the kid being poisoned, not to mention Walt murdering Mike.&nbsp; Jesse might end up killing walt because he has that gun which has had so much attention paid to it, and because of all the above hell Walt&#039;s caused him. And there is still the Risen cigarette in Walts possesion. <br /><br />I think Jesse dying might just be too predictable because they said he was originally going to die in season 1. Still it would be the saddest thing to see him die.&nbsp; I have no idea if Walt will die or not, it could really go either way. I think the cancer is back though otherwise they wouldn&#039;t have shown it in the finale. Maybe that&#039;s why hes buying a machine gun, because he&#039;ll be dead soon anyway. I am so excited I think it is going to be excellent! Sad that its over though.&nbsp;

				Would love to see Walt strangle Skylar. Couldnt believe she gave all Walts cash to that guy she was shagging.<br /><br />Damn i would have tied her to the back of my car and gone drag racing.

				I think Hank will have a live changing experience and then join the good side of the fight. The war on drugs will then stop and Walther will become president. Then all unicorns will fart out shards of LSD.<br /><br />Or it could go a different way.

				Has anybody else noticed Marie&#039;s INSANE OBSESSION with the color purple. Literally EVERYTHING that bitch owes is purple, anything from her pot holders to her curtains. Since episode one, if you don&#039;t believe me or haven&#039;t noticed, check it out, you won&#039;t be able to not notice it now that I&#039;ve pointed it out (like my double negative). But ya, I think Walt dies, a legacy is left behind, and that his bitch of a wife either&nbsp; drives herself insane or gets killed, hopefully the latter...

				I totally agree, Walts wife has been riding him non stop...she&#039;s a cunt, hopefully she&#039;ll get taken out. <br /><br />I could see Holly passing on, Walt was completely unsympathetic about the boy in the desert or the one he poisoned

				Walt Jr is gonna rape skylar and feed her to the baby.. nah but like you all agreed fuck that cunt skylar i hope she does die... anyway, if walt jr wasnt a retard i could see walt showing him the ropes, but ultimately i see walt killing pinkman and any other loose ends to try and make hanks dumbass bulid a case, which i think fatfuck will fail and walt will ride away in the sunset fucking hookers in canadia.
