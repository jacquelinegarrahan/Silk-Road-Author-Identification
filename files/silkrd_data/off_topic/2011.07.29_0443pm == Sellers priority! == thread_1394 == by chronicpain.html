				I just wanted to say a few things.. Granted, buyers are risking a lot purchasing but remember, sellers are risking a lot too. I just wanted to remind everyone that sellers should have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason (without feeling guilty)..<br /><br />I have decided that If I don&#039;t feel 100 percent right about a sale, Im not going to do it. So, if your sale gets canceled, don&#039;t take it personal, it that I just didn&#039;t feel right about something. I trust my gut 100 percent. I may not give you all the reasons but if I cancel, you probably already have a feeling on the reason, lol...<br /><br />I&#039;m not going to get into specifics, but always be consistent. Don&#039;t be pushy/demanding. Basically, just use common sense and you should be fine. If you have any questions or concerns about an order, just pm me and Ill tell you the specifics that you want to know, etc. <br /><br />Thanks...

				Very well put, chronicpain.&nbsp; You managed to make a very strong point without mentioning anyone or anything.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I could have done that good a job or shown such restraint.<br /><br />I think that refusing certain orders is some of the most effective harm reduction done by sellers, in any situation.&nbsp; &#039;nuff said.

				Sounds good as long as the buyer gets the same bitcoinage value he put in. Don&#039;t buy off SR so don&#039;t know but seen the one guy complaining about people cancelling then he loses money.<br /><br />But hell yeah a seller or buyer should be able to back out at anytime before the product is shipped, on here at least.<br /><br />In f2f once a person is confirmed to be on their way to you, it&#039;s considered rude to back out regardless of reason unless it&#039;s over product or price(change).&nbsp; It&#039;s an extremely quick was of getting cut off.<br /><br />By price I don&#039;t mean you find them/it cheaper before the guy came, I mean the guy changes prices when he comes, then it&#039;s fair to change.

				Hey Chronic,<br /><br />Good post.&nbsp; Is it OK just to place an order without any extra messaging assuming all the details are known?&nbsp; I like to keep it to a minimum but I read here about&nbsp; people who are messaging sellers&nbsp; a lot, even if they&#039;re not buying.&nbsp; Is it rude just to order, I mean,&nbsp; I don&#039;t see the point of small talk...&nbsp; Also cancelling is one thing, the bitcoins in escrow are released, but why would a seller mark &quot;in transit&quot; and then not ship?&nbsp; The bitcoins get locked in escrow for two weeks. Who would stand to benefit from needlessly holding someone else&#039;s bitcoins in escrow?<br />

				So as sellers, we approve of being able to cancel for no reason? <br />If so it should be amended to the buyers/sellers guide.

If I were to say in the product description to pm me first, then do so. Lets say that I put &quot;will not accept po boxes&quot; your order will probably be canceled if you gave me a po box. Then pm me and we&nbsp; can talk about it. (that was just an example) Or if&nbsp; you send me 1 btc on top of the order because you expect it to be overnighted. I would cancel. It would have to be pretty extreme for me to cancel unless there was an un forseen problem. But, I would never cancel an order that has been sitting there for a couple days. So far, the only reasons I have had to cancel is because the buyer didn&#039;t follow my instructions.<br /><br />Just follow the instructions from the buyer and you shouldn&#039;t have any issues. I encourage buyers to ask me questions if they are unsure of anything.
