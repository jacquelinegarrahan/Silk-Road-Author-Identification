			<dd class="postbody">
				I&#039;ve asked around and apparently no one in or around my area is selling shrooms, and there is a demand. I&#039;d like to ask the community here some questions to get their individual opinions, answers, and tips: <br /><br />Do mushrooms smell as strong as weed?<br />If you were me, what would your prices be?<br /><br /><br />but most importantly: <br /><br />What are the consequences for selling shrooms? ( located in USA, east cost )<br />*i read somewhere today online that one could be sentenced to life in prison but i thought that was bullshit*<br /><br />A thank you to everyone who responds, as this has been on my mind for the past week.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do mushrooms smell as strong as weed?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No they definitely don&#039;t have a strong distinctive smell as marijuana does, I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about that.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you were me, what would your prices be?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Obviously prices vary from region to region but in western Canada they&#039;re usually $5/g $30/quarter $100/ounce etc. But recently here there&#039;s been more of a demand for them and I&#039;ve heard of prices being $10/g which is why I&#039;m considering stepping into the mushroom game too!<br /><br />As for the penalties, I&#039;m not too sure about the US but I&#039;m sure a little googling could help!
