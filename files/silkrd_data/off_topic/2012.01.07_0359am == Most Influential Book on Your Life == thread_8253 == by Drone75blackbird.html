				Couldn&#039;t find this topic so I thought I&#039;d begin it. I am interested in seeing what has influenced some of the most interesting people on the internet. Please limit to one (if possible) or just a select few.<br /><br />Anyway, by far mine is Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer (minus the chapters about the author).

				I wouldn&#039;t fix to a single book written by him, but the author which influenced me most was Robert Anton Wilson.<br />If I would really be forced to choose one of his book i think i&#039;ll take &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot;<br /><br />Also Leary and the &quot;Little Prince&quot; did very much on me

				Wow, that&#039;s hard to choose from. But I can list my Top Five in no particular order.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies, by William Golding;<br />Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand;<br />Crime and Punishment, by Fyódor Dostoievsky;<br />Demian, by Hermann Hesse; and<br />Stranger in a Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein.<br /><br />Taken together, they paint what I feel is a very accurate picture of human nature, especially if you know a bit about each author&#039;s biography when reading these works of fiction. I&#039;m constantly going back to these books and they have most certainly shaped my way of thinking to a huge degree.

				Not sure if I can pick just one ... but if I think about books that have influenced my way of thinking in some great fashion or really made me stop and wonder, I&#039;d go with these, in no particular order.<br /><br />The Kybalion - Three Initiates<br />For Us, The Living - Robert Heinlein<br />The Rama Trilogy (ok, that&#039;s 3 books - but books 2 and 3 are better than the first one) - Arthur C. Clarke

I completely agree that economic security is just as important, or even more than, territorial security... after all compare our intervention in the middle east (which is all about OIL no matter what anyone says) to our failure to intervene in Rwanda because we simply had no economic motivation to do so. I liked the UN&#039;s excuse that their failure was because no one could agree on what the definition of &quot;genocide&quot; was...<br /><br />The European Union was a noble experiment into the evaporation of national boundaries, but as we&#039;ve come to see today it has basically failed. The list of reasons why it failed is long, and so I&#039;ll save that for a different discussion. :P<br /><br />Moving on, the question of how the fate of the nation-state is affected by forces such as globalization is an interesting one. The emergence of non-state actors such as international NGOs or terrorist groups is often used to support the argument that the nation-state is in fact slowly becoming obsolete. However, I personally feel, and there is much evidence to support such, that the majority of non-state actors merely ADVANCE the interests of nation-states (especially the american global hegemony!). For example, the UN supports and advances all of the United States&#039; interests. The World Bank pretends to be committed to ending poverty when in reality it provides high interest loans to third world countries on the condition that they open their markets (as in to american exports), which usually wreaks absolutely havoc on their local economies.<br /><br />Gosh I don&#039;t think nation-state will ever become obsolete. The supposed blurring of the boundaries separating them is really just an illusion. What it is that we&#039;re not seeing because of this illusion is the real question.
