				Has anyone figured this out yet? Cap-m- Quick does not seem to work well because it is inn accurate. Currently i weigh it out one by one then dump it in a size 0 cap (molly im reffering to) using a business card and a home made funnel. Surely there has to be a better way. I know Capmquick does not work unless you know how much filler to mix in X grams weight. People see the 150mg amount in a size 0 cap an bitch it next to nothing (until they take it) so as much as I dont want to use a filler its almost necessary to keep friends quiet. Does anyone have an answer besides buying a tab press lol? <br /><br />Thanks in advance

				Tell them to stop bitching if they are getting a clean 150? I know I would prefer that than either getting a stupidly large dose/filler to be unsure of the correct dose

				Crush it till it&#039;s consistent and use a smaller capsule size, then just practice scooping up the right quantity - you&#039;ll get it down after a few. You can always weigh the filled caps to check.

				The small end of a size 4 capsule holds ~100mg of crushed mdma crystals.

				Crush it and throw it all on the scale, watch it go down by 100mg as you scoop straight into the cap.&nbsp; FAST?

				Try a size 1 or lower. people bitched with MDMA in a size 0. (until they took it). <br /><br />I was like, &quot;motherfucker If I gave you a good steak, but it came on a bigger plate, would you think any less of the steak/&#039;<br /><br />Then he shut up and rolled balls and thanked me for my wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;:o

				Yeah, I was at a festival once trying to sell some extra molly and these kids were like &quot;We&#039;re looking for something with a little more in it&quot;.&nbsp; I was boggled and walked away.&nbsp; I have only used or seen size 0 and I&#039;ve seen them FULL before? Probably cut methlyone or something. I didn&#039;t understand that either.
