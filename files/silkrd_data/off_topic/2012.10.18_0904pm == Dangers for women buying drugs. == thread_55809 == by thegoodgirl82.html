				This is one of Silk Roads real strengths. It allows people who normally wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable approaching drug dealers the option to partake in a few exotic treats if they feel the need. People who have left behind their youthful days of experimentation and no longer move in the same social circles that once had access to such things. Silk Road welcomes all for whatever reasons. :)

				I agree. From a young age (13) I have been offered drugs from shady guys and I&#039;ve always said no because I could feel it in the air that they&#039;d expect me to do them a favor in return. A friend of mine lost her virginity to a 18-19ish guy who asked her to come into his room so he could give her some drugs, when she was only 14. As soon as we left his house she started crying and it took a long time (days) before she even told is what happened in there. Unless a decent friend is offering the drug, I generally won&#039;t accept anything without paying a fair price, because I&#039;d hate having a guy after me all night. Even paying for my drugs, I&#039;ve been annoyed by dealers who have thought they can sleep with me just because they sold me drugs, and I&#039;ve quit buying from this one dealer for that reason.

				That&#039;s bad what happened to your friend... <br /><br />For your dealer, the fact is that people think they can do everything with money (drug = money) and, in fact, absolutely not...

				This is where SilkRoad comes into it&#039;s own as a unique drugs marketplace, every one of us can make purchases of whatever we wish from the safety of our own sofas 24/7, eliminating the associated risks and fears with an IRL deal. I can relate to your concerns, I only use SilkRoad for my purchases now, not only for it&#039;s endless selection, but the vendors a lot more customer focused, and the merchandise is a far higher quality then anything I can acquire IRL, there&#039;s a little wait, but in my eyes it&#039;s more then worth it.<br /><br />Thank-you DPR for empowering people like OP to do whatever they want to do peacefully without worry, you have truly changed the drugs marketplace for the better and common good of all :)

				That is humerous as I am a very large man 6`3 360LBs I have 5 female customers that shop in person at my house or I will deliver coffee &amp; weed or Hash to them They tell me all the time they are terrified of dealing with drug dealers but it is funny because they text my wife all day &amp; nite just to chat and say Hi.they never seem nervous around me so I feel better about the whole situation<br /><br />I usually never spot drugs ( just bad business ) but I have been dealing with these ladies and never have I had to go get my money they are more honest than 3 of the guys I supply steadily they seem to always have an excuse

I have never been tempted to try smack, meth or any other &#039;addict&#039; associated drugs. I have nothing against anybody that frequents these drugs, the way I see it, I&#039;m a drug user too, so who am I to judge by saying which recreational drugs are better or worse for you?&nbsp; I like using recreational drugs for their recreational aspects, and am grateful for the experiences I&#039;ve shared with friends on them. Hypothetically, if I ever started to associate myself with addiction, which I believe I never will, it be time to end my days as a recreational drug user, because it would no longer be fun, I would become a slave to addiction. I feel truly sorry for any women, and for that matter man that&#039;s addicted, it&#039;s a sad and sorry existence, I wish them better.

Due to their lack of self esteem and self worth they could be easily be taken advantage of, of course this would be dependent on the mentality of the dealer, if he chose to make his money through this form of exploitation, I would say he is the low of the low, and brings down the &#039;good dealers&#039; with the right business mentality, unfortunately all dealers are tarnished by the same brush by society, and that&#039;s where it goes wrong. I really feel sorry for those women, and wish those dealers exploit women like that will rot in hell.

				I&#039;ve actually considered the subject quite a bit over the years from dealing with such people and judging from my own experience I have never seen anything positive come from dealing heroin expect the obvious cash benefit. I see selling those kinds of things as exploitation because of it&#039;s nature and what it almost always turns into. I am not really a very sympathetic person by nature and I don&#039;t really care about people I don&#039;t know myself. I&#039;m quite pragmatic about the fundamentals of selling drugs which is that the party-people are your cash-cow. Having said that you don&#039;t have to treat your cows like shit, good farmers don&#039;t do they? I&#039;d rather keep my cows happy and healthy than just shove them through the slaughterhouse. <br /><br />Bit of a brutal metaphor but I&#039;m sure you see where I&#039;m going with it.

As your in the business and I&#039;m not, we see this from different perspectives. I am a sympathetic person, I care about people, I&#039;m have one of those personality traits, nor am I particularly self centered. Perhaps if I was in the business I would see this entirely differently, as it would be my business interests that would matter. In spite of this, I still believe there should be an ethical code of conduct when it comes to treating your customers (I think this is what your saying by not having to treat your cows like shit?), and it should be firmly be put into practice. There are ethics to drug dealing, and I believe immoral treatment of vulnerable women is crossing an unethical line.

				See for me it&#039;s a pragmatic thing as well. I wouldn&#039;t really want to live the life where I had to cater for addiction because it means you&#039;d be on call 24/7. Who wants to do that? Also I think they change dealers even if they don&#039;t sell it and I can&#039;t be bothered with that either. I knew a few people that graduated from Mandy and Blow into selling things like crack and heroin and within 6 months of them starting to sell it they were completely different to when they were doing Mandy and Blow. They didn&#039;t even take the stuff themselves but it just changed their outlook on life and personalities to the point where they were completely different. On top of that addicts always have issues and come with baggage, dealing with normal people who have enough normal baggage is enough when you sell weight IRL and I get agg enough when people ask for tick when they know it&#039;s always cash upfront. I can&#039;t be arsed with junkies asking for tick and I dunno, wanting to leave their baby as collateral while they go nick a few grand. No tah, it&#039;s just detrimental to my day.&nbsp; :-\

				I understand this too, it&#039;s a whole different ball game dealing in crack and heroin, in comparison to dealing dealing in MDMA and coke, they&#039;re entirely different markets, with a different clientle base.&nbsp; Those people that you knew that done it, probably weren&#039;t thinking, they were probably just seeing the money without thinking about the consequences and impact it could have on their lives, biting off more then they could chew, it ended up consuming their energy and personalities as a&nbsp; result. To deal in hard core drugs, you need to have a certain kind of character, and perhaps that&#039;s where the ruthlessness sets in, if you have to deal with these addicts and their emotional baggage, at that level intensity day in day out, it&#039;s probably enough to make you go insane yourself, let alone having them on the phone 24/7, where&#039;s your time to breathe? I still can&#039;t justify a drug dealer wrongly taking advantage of a vulnerable woman though, the moral high ground needs to be drawn somewhere.
