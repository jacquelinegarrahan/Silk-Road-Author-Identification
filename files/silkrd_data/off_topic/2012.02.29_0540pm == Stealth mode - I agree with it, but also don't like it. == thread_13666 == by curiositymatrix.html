				I understand the reasons behind it, and do think a seller should have an option to only be viewable by proven customers, but for someone who is looking to sample some of everything, this really limits the market.<br /><br />My biggest problem is what this does to prices - vendors with the best prices go to stealth mode, and have their customer base and good prices running. But this removes the &#039;best deals&#039; from the public market, allowing the vendors who remain public to increase their prices, without competition from the vendors who used to keep the prices low. <br /><br />For example: Oils and concentrates have a total of 17 listings, a fraction what they used to be - and some of the best product / deals appear gone. A few are left, yes, but the glorious range of options isn&#039;t so broad anymore :(<br /><br />It may be a result of closing down some lottos, scammers, etc, but in the cannabis category, what used to be 650+ listings is now 382. And that number has been dropping daily.<br /><br />I dunno, it just feels like the stealth mode is a logical step, but it robbed SR of some of its magic. Perhaps vendors should be allowed to list their product for all to see somewhere, and then new buyers have to go through a more secure process for their first order, or have a 2-step escrow process (first to reserve the order, then the vendor accepts it from the buyer, then the buyer releases funds) <br /><br />It&#039;s that or trawling through the forums, hoping to find a vendor&#039;s ID or listings posted... Asking someone else in a PM for a vendor&#039;s ID feels like it would undermine the whole point of stealth mode to much.<br /><br />tl;dr: Stealth mode is reducing price competition, limiting the total availability of quality product. I&#039;d like a way to still have as many options available to me (perhaps make it so a vendor is only visible to someone with a certain monetary value of transactions under their belt, to filter out scammers)

				I would like to see stealth mode be implemented by the listing, so a seller could list public products, and have stealth listings that don&#039;t show up on their profile or the main listings that could be PM&#039;d to regular customers/friends. that way, custom listings don&#039;t fill vendor profiles, and there might be some people who would like to have some listings be public, and others be private.<br /><br />edit: i guess I didn&#039;t research that enough, as it looks like it DOES work that way

				I had not known that - I was under the impression that stealth mode applied to all of a seller&#039;s listings at once.<br /><br />Perhaps sellers could have a viewable profile listing some offers, but not buy-able, and people PM them to set up a deal? With the point being that the seller would only accept these request from established buyers.

				so was I, but I just put up a test listing, and it does not show up under my profile, but my standard listing is there. I like the way it works.

				Hm. Guess we&#039;ll just have to see how vendors adapt to this. Too bad I didn&#039;t favorite budderman before he disappeared, I really want to try some.

I agree with you on selection, here&#039;s my workaround, that saves you work in the long run anyway:<br />go to the &#039;rumor mill&#039; section, and read the review threads for your drug of choice. This will have lots of into about various vendors and their products, as well as, most importantly, their silk road address - from there you can go to their profile and read their listings and order.
