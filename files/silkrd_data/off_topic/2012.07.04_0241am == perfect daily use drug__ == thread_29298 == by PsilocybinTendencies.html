				I smoke weed everyday so I don&#039;t consider that an answer to this question, that&#039;s just my normal state of mind.<br /><br />I love to trip but tolerance sucks.<br /><br />But I want something else to do when I get off work.<br /><br />Preferably a 2-6 hour buzz, that is intense, doesn&#039;t cause alotta tolerance so I can do it regularly, and will make me forget about the things that depress me (or put it in perspective the way acid does).<br /><br />Not heroin.<br /><br />Any suggestions??

				Ketamine and/or MXE would probably be fine in small doses. You can take the dose higher every now and then but you&#039;ll likely cause more damage that way. I recommend you try MXE simply because you smoke weed. You&#039;ll save so much money on weed just because MXE makes it that much stronger from smoking less. They go together great and can make everyday life super interesting...although a bit more confusing. ;)<br /><br />I usually do a small 15-25mg bump before I smoke depending on how often I take breaks. For the most part I mix the two 5 days out of the week and haven&#039;t had the slightest sign of side-effects or dependence too.

				I don&#039;t know about daily, but 4-aco-det has been working for me every couple/three days for a good 3-4 hour trip. the doses have been increasing slightly each time (to levels I will not admit here for fear of a noob diving in) but I have not had any bad side effects from it so far.

				Cool. I think I&#039;m getting a limetless aco sample (not sure), but ill look into the dissociatives.<br /><br />I&#039;ve read before that this can help with depression but was leery cause of the olneys lesions.<br /><br />But I give much less of a fuck about my health now so ill look deeper into the idea.

				Yeah, the drug you are describing doesn&#039;t exist. Imo, it isn&#039;t good to mask symptoms of depression by getting high, it only delays you dealing with it, unless you stay high for the rest of your life. Daily dissociative use comes with a lot of problems, like derealization/lasting cognitive effects like not being able to think of words, stuttering, etc... I&#039;d stick to irregular use of high dose psychadelics

				With your help, this has been a really productive thread for me guys.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><br />1) With the exception of sampling Limet&#039;s Aco here in a couple weeks if it shows, I&#039;m laying off the psychedelics for at least a month, maybe even two. It feels good to have a stash if I need it for any reason. And tolerance makes it a pain in the ass. I love going to that place but I seem to have wore out my welcome for the moment.<br /><br />2) The idea of a drug that can combat my blues through only one dose every couple of weeks is too powerful to not try. I&#039;ll be investing in a little bit of ketamine.<br /><br />3) If the ketamine doesn&#039;t work, going to give clonazepam a shot.<br /><br />4) As far as more regular recreation goes, I still haven&#039;t decided. It&#039;s starting to look like there is no such drug. Someone did suggest the aco so I&#039;m going to be assessing it for that purpose, but I&#039;m not going to hold my breath. I&#039;m not really even sure what I&#039;m looking for with this anymore. I got to thinking, perhaps if steps 2 or 3 work, they will end up rendering step 4 unnecessary.<br /><br />You guys are awesome.
