				im writing about poverty ..<br />and goin through my key ring.. makin sure i contact da vendors i work with..<br /><br />Critical Thinking 6.2<br /><br />1<br />To what extent should the government be allowed to intervene in the personal lives of people who receive financial assistance?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel government should intervene on their assistance after regular nominal resources have been used in their entirety. I must ask when is enough , really enough? Meaning to me that when can we pull the plug on benefits someone is earning and receiving. I can asses that it would only be wise for government to control money they are giving which also gives a reason to help those who really do need it when others have successfully used the programs to their advantage and not to benefit improper use of misused government grants. Then with the intervention the client can provide proof of meeting requirement so that a caseworker me review and proceed to renew or close case after provided seeing that a client might have gotten back on their feet and are able to provide for themselves.<br /><br />2<br />To what extent should the government be allowed to intervene in the personal lives of its own employees ?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was an employee for the government I would expect them to be in my personal work so that my clients and work is on the same page as the people I work for, This would ensure optimal effiency and good cloe and strong bonded relations with clients. Allowing them to see how work follows among a chain of command. I want to think its ok to have the Boss in an employees work, but when I think of it as personal life, I would want to at least leave that to a minimal. A social worker must have a personal life after putting in a weeks worth of work. Would you think the government would want me in ther personal life ? I highly doubt it, and when it comes to it, I would assume as long as they prosper and see their funds are being dispensed at its best , it would only ensure better buisness, not to mention profits would surely follow<br /><br />3<br />To what extent should the government be allowed to intervene in your personal life?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as a client this can be different seeing that their personal life entails of hardship. Since a client is requesting assistance, I would want government to intervene enough to extract the factors and to verify the protocols we seek are met and all criteria is matched to what a client might be experiencing. If no sort of involvement would be given from the government, who&#039;s to say who&#039;d be getting away with what, because it would feel like a free for all, when a potential client is using fraud to benefit financially. This wouldnâ€™t be much of a lot of intervention just enough to have say maybe a caseworker with home calls or a outing during a regular day in the life of a client.<br /><br />4<br />How should governmental intervention differ, if at all, concerning its involvement in the lives of people receiving assistance or people it employs, or in your own life?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should probably only intervene just as much or with the same influence on an employee and client. To have more time than one or the other would only amount to more field work that the government would be involved in. I feel if two birds can be hit with one stone than so be it, this would ensure that the same time given with the employee would enforce at the same time the field work and personal time to create house calls. So like an FDA checks restaurants for health code violations, this could be applied in the same theory.. so like all at once the intervention can be placed. If assessed and needed more time can be arranged to an employee or client using benefits<br /><br />5<br />To what extent is the assumption true that a man automatically involved with a another should be expected to provide her and her family financial support ? To what extent, if any, does this reflect a sexist approach ? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true to the fact that if in a wedlock a family or anybody to not be bias is illegible for assistance. To lean toward one more than the other would rule out the fact that it&#039;s impossible to find say a male, with a case and example where the man is left to single and to take care of a family a woman left him with. It would be easily misunderstood and interpreted wrongly thinking that just because&nbsp; a man is the man of the house that nothing like financial hardships can only effect women who are single parents be sexist<br /><br />

				^i got my drugs off unreliable sketchy 15 year olds which id have to travel to get to, so i would probably choose SR weed or no weed - though im appreciative of people w medical/junkie needs who probably do get about agitated without sr, sort of understandably<br /><br />and idk what ill be doing... ive got some paracord and im trying to make a cat toy out of catnip wrapped in tissue and placed in a knot called the monkeys fist. last one i made had some of the tissue exposed and so my cat just fucked it up. learning knots from yt vids is frustrating.
