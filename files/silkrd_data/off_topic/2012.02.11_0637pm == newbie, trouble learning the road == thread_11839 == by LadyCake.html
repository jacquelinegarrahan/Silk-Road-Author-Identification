				The post below is one that im probably sure i put in the wrong thread... Sorry! Im learning, slowly but surely!<br /><br /><br />Hello all.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am very excited to have figured out Tor and Silk Road basics, but my inexperience in all things security related has left me baffled. I have read virtually all the FAQs and How-to&#039;s from BitCoins to PGP and everything in between, but still I find myself so confused. I am losing patience spending hours a day trying to figure all this out. Let&#039;s just say that the extent of my computer skills would be setting up a wireless router that I just bought at WalMart, and all i know how to use is basic windows applications. This being said, I am afraid to dive in an attempt a purchace...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I&#039;ll spend a few more days researching and learning before going any further. In writing this, I&#039;m even questioning if posting it will be a red flag for potential attackers and scammers wanting to take advantage of my inexperience. What do you guys think? Also, when registering on the forum I wondered if using a gmail account is safe (this question alone probably reveals exactly how ignorant i am!) <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can anyone give me some pointers?<br /><br />Thank you so much!

				you sound like your on the right track.. not exactly sure what your asking but il just break it down as simply as i can, this is just one interpretation, everyone sees things a bit differently, esp when it comes to security.<br /><br />required programs<br />-tor browser<br />-SR account<br />-bitcoin supplier (get-bitcoin.com)<br />-bitcoin wallet<br />-PGP setup<br /><br />thats all you need.. you can use SR all you want then, if you want to take security a step further you need a program for HD encryption like Truecrypt, and a program called Liberte linux?? i dont use it, dont know much about it (google) <br /><br />i also have a tormail.net account that i use if i communicate outside or SR on Tor. Good to go :)

				Well - read everything ... like the info when you register to the forum that you don´t need to give away any real email address.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Other than that - it´s straight forward and the biggest risk will always be the shipping to your home address. The highly theoretical &quot;dangers&quot; in the virtual world are a smaller problem. Don´t volunteer any information that is not needed. This means just your shipping address and nothing else. <br /><br />Otherwise - stick to TOR and the browser in the package, Bitcoins and don´t use other tools (except pgp to encrypt messages). This should be as safe as is reasonable.
