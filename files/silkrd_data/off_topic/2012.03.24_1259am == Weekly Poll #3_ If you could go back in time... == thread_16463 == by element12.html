				For example, if you are a heroin user, cigarette smoker, crack smoker, etc. and you had the opportunity to change your past and never have tried that drug, would you?&nbsp; Or are you happy you found it?<br /><br />Also, feel free to post below which drugs you&#039;re thinking about.<br /><br />Past polls:<br />-Week 1:Which of the following is your favorite class of drugs? <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=14605.0<br />-Week 2: If you found $500, how much would you spend on SR? <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=15442.0

				I voted &quot;no&quot; mostly because I&#039;ve never fallen to the addiction of the drugs I&#039;ve used (luckily).&nbsp; The worst, I suppose, would be cigarettes, but I&#039;ve only smoked them socially with others and not really by myself.&nbsp; Somehow, whenever I ran out of a prescription for vicodin or percs, I just suffered through the withdraws and life went on.<br />One of my most memorable moments was snorting a good -- free ;) -- line of coke while peaking on acid.&nbsp; I had found this dj&#039;s dropped external harddrive with all his music on it, and he gave me the line as a reward.&nbsp; He then introduced me to all the guys/girls who were putting on the event. Man, I felt ontop of my shit. =]<br />

				I try not to regret the things I&#039;ve done in life.<br /><br />Just learn from my mistakes and move on. That said, I&#039;ve not been addicted to heroin or the like, so I guess that may change things a little.

				I used to have a nasty coke habit, which let to a nasty sports gambling habit back in my 20s, but hell I had some good times back then too. Can&#039;t say I regret ever doing the coke, maybe I regret the gambling. It wasted a lot of possible coke money, heh.

				I would say all the drugs my parents forced me to take. They made me suicidal for years and fried my memory/killed my personality. Well, at least my ability to express myself openly in public. Now the only time I can socialize comfortably is through the use of drugs that I choose to do.

				yes - cigarettes - just can&#039;t quit the fucking things.<br /><br />had a coke habit a couple of years ago that was a piece of piss to give up compared to ciggies. other than that - nope. would have tried most things anyway, but i can&#039;t afford to get hooked on any real drugs cos cigs are so expensive!
