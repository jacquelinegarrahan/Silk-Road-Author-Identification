				Hey guys, <br /><br />I took acid for the first time the other day. And whilst tripping wrote this report - I haven&#039;t edited it, simply removed names and identifying features. So some of it is very poorly spelled and doesn&#039;t make a great deal of sense. But fuck, what do you expect from a guy that&#039;s tripping? <br /><br />Also, only just realised the sheer length of this thing... it&#039;s nine and a half thousand words, 19 pages. What the actual shit? Why can&#039;t I write that much when I need to!? Will have to split it into two posts.<br /><br />I took 6 Purple Lotus from The Emporium.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Trip took ages to start, who knows why. Could not be LSD, could just be a few dud blotters then bang a goodone. Could be shitty dosed, all built up.&nbsp; open eye distortions. Like the strobe thing more than anything.<br /><br />Really fucking happy. But feel kind of a tension in my neck. Nice radiator feeling from my temples washing over my eyes. <br /><br />Lots of deep breaths, parts of the clouds Im watching become bigger, like photoshop bulge tool. then disappear. Cant tell how much of what I&#039;m seeing is cloud movement and how much is lsd. colours not, totally normal. Kind of, reactive. Sy blue tinges at purple for a second then back to a bluer blue than I&#039;ve ever seen before in my life. Clouds seem to spiral in on them selves uncontrollably..<br /><br />Ones disappeared totally.<br /><br />I see a sort of chaos pin the clouds. A story. A nature of layers and movement that can&#039;t be faked. A rippling, thri ing movement. Like a school of fish all moving towards freedom. The clouds effervesce onto the horizon. Each swish of air flying off further and further. A disconnected feeling from my hands that seem to be typing auto nonymously. going to laugh at all the spelling mistakes I feel my hands making. Hard to interprett later i suspect.<br /><br />Cloduds really do go on forever. I see hints upside down. And I wonder if this is how they&#039;re supposed to be viewed. Things gain more perspective in this way. It looks like, I am above the clouds on a plane, starring over the horizon of beautiful fluffy clouds that look like they&#039;d bunco yu right off them. Fluffy and soft, like hills made out of pillows. But they get smaller and further away. I want to touch them more than i have wanted to touch anything ever. They form a menacing shape in the sky. A sort of pig on all fours with a large skull shape with a piggy nose and a tongue sticking out, kind of the :D face but tonguue extended and flattened down. I am in a good frame of mind so its not upsetting I&#039;m just stoked I can see something like that with a clear mind. It disappears a bit but that face stilll hits hard. I see teeth where it was before and a whole new picture as tube cloud crosses o er another. A wolf, a t rex of a fucking monster with a long nose and sharp teeth. Its definitely a tree .If I could ever see a t rex I would think its dimensions and structure would be similar, besides being made from vapour. It has a kind quality to its rather shaped brow. Like rex from toy story. It shrinks off int the distance, becoming kinda as it leaves. Like puff the magic dragon. Its teeth fade. <br /><br />quick glance at the screen shows how messed my vision looks. I feel acidic. Probably on account of the fruit platter i had but worries of vomit are in my head. Will try to avoid that thought. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />clouds gone from my own little theatre. Need a wee though I went before. Gunna stand up and try a bit, see how it goes.<br />as i got up BIG fucking burps, i don&#039;t ever burp either. Then a little ball rolled on my laptop. Bout fucking punched that mother fucker. But its not real, its a little ball from something I was messing with earlier.<br /><br />NO HOMO<br />]<br /><br /><br />piss felt nice, clearer than i thought. Must be drinking more than I give my self credit for. Paniced because I forgot I had coca-cola (actual drink not coke reference never touched coke, wouldn&#039;t wanna for a while. Never actually had the ambition to do coke, I don&#039;t see that much of an appeal beyond the weight loss. I suppose I prefer mind altering drugs because i am unhappy with how my mind operates now. I have (Profession edited) tests soon. Tests i know I should be revising for. I haven&#039;t been to any of the sessions all year. Perhaps a handful at the start. I grew sick of the people I encountered, the fakeness and rudeness. I met some of the worst mannered people either out of ignorance or sheer tom foolery loll I mean more ind of. on purpose. Either they were raised like that or are doing it to be dicks. But either way, I hate that shit. They a lll swarm around things, they have no concept of makers. I really do think its stuff like that which will cause problems. Stuff will anend a guy insane. I can&#039;t help but look at a bug on my window and think how much I want to squish it. But then the specs on the window, the many many specs. Are they bugs. Bugs or dirt bugs or dirt. I dunno. Everything moves a bit win you look at it. But that ones definitely a bug. I wonder what bug. Looks like a spider in movement but more an insect in sie and behaviour (fucking dumb) Oh it just flew. So its a fly. Weird movement for a fly. Perhaps he&#039;s catching lucy vibes from me. Skies still empty<br /><br />Moving to classical music. The current rock is just pissing me off. I hear noises, people talking I don&#039;t like it. I can&#039;t tell if its real or not. Oh okay it is real, theres a bunch of kids i think outside, like 17yos. Don&#039;t want them to see a (age edited) year old guy tripping balls so i hide behind the curtain. Peeking to see when they&#039;ll fuck off. This classical music, more fucking layered than the rock ,more aggressive even. Fucking chopin what you playing at. Cunt. Bunch of fucking chavs by looks of it stopped to take photos, see no alcohol in hand, could just be high off life I guess. Miss the days of getting drunk young. All the hope of a blow job and novelty 3 quids worth of vod can do for you. Thinking about more tabs. The youths have left. Still no clouds and starting to get dark and cold. I want more warmth, not fake blanket warmth but sunshine, warming your bones warmth. Would be sick to do lucy on holiday, big fucking sun raping your shit. High off of melanin and all the cid you could dream of. <br /><br />This is already a long type and I aint even felt like 5 minutes gone. Gunna try something, report bak after.givdn up on that giggity goo business. Too happy dude. (This was masturbation, LOL)<br /><br />Colpours aren&#039;t as fun as i thought they would be bu the tapping of my fingers on the keys makes me want to push faster and faster&nbsp; and i find an almost poetic beat in the keys taking actually fucking half steps here there and everywhere with my mind. That one fucking calble is really quite interesting which i suppose opens up led for the curry bumpkins because they have fucking nothing to look at. my legs are restless, they want to do something. They have their own mind completely. I dunno what they want and vice versa. Just let them fucking moose about if they wanna fucking santa clause looking mother fuckers. Weird blurred vision on my upper peripheral. Thought my wait still think my contacts are gluing but I dunno its everywhere and the music of the keyboard coms back in again with the heavy base note of the repetitive space bar and particular words giving off raps and patterns and flows it sounds like fucking music to me maybe i shoulld put some more music on but still i can&#039;t help but feel like I&#039;m rapping or painting without looking or some fucking ruan man shit but still I don&#039;t know my mind and eyes and legs are all their own entities I hear the typing but I know that I&#039;m typing but I can&#039;t quite th k what I&#039;m typing my hands feel pressured into doing what they&#039;re doing with no avenue to stop they just kep typing they&#039;re shaking but good like Im reaching a climax fuck I actually feel like Im going to cum from my palms right into the fucking motherboard of this laptop. Really wish I had something to fuck the shit out of right now. My ears are warm. Well my right on is really warm. Was typing this a bad idea though question point one. Should I be asking is going to be point 2&nbsp; but lets go chronological. No. <br /><br />It fucking rocked.<br /><br />All my ideas rock.<br /><br />Especially the one about taking more acid? No. Not yet. Maybe some mandy but lets keep things at a tight intersection. Wasn&#039;t expecting this cerebral hit. So much more distancing of body and mind. Like my hands really are just typing my thought patterns but my thought are something else before current time. My thoughts dictate what i think next, abut the thought, which my hands write about so really my hands are a thought of a thought of a thought. The keyboard sounded nice with that repetition.s. Theres got to be some kind of street music here some kind of it underground the keyboarders the warriors of words the support guys you never speak to th ones that you never see behind the scenes and ripping up raid derives like a demon, they all be sitting and scheming, bout taking down the whole world with their logical transfressionaries.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DONT LIKE READING BACK AT THAT SHIT. Like going through time on some fucking back to the future shit. Not even seen that film HATERS WHAT. and now my eyes are fucking blipping. Like a light switch going on and off. Fucking whatttttt sooonnnn. lolling ab out how i thik i will be when reading this back. I don&#039;t actually imagine ever reading it back just thinking i should delete it or maybe anon share it s people can see what someones hands that is doing acid for the first time does when left to their own devices. My mind really is just fucking one walling now. They just concentrate on one thing. The screen. The ceiling. the fucking dot on my window which there are so many. Like seriously never realised how fucking dirty my window is SHIIIIt Im a dirty skakny ASS HO. <br /><br />Feel deflated now. But not really, if I&#039;m typing then at least my hands are still on a hype. But for a moment there was a lull and I didn&#039;t know what to do. And I think if i stop typing then things will gbet boring but luckily my hands keep going but unluckily they are onlly flesh and bone and ligament and tissue and muscle and I feel them becoming lethargic and they do want to continue but I feel I should rest them but at the same time can&#039;t with my fucking top vision flickers. If i rest my hands which I did then i kind of lose the analytical side to it which i dunno if i like ill try it a few more times but I already have&nbsp; kind of apprehension. No I don&#039;t posit e thinking and all of that jazz and besides the music of the keyboard is going back and i don&#039;t even care if what I&#039;m writing actually has mistakes or not if not then fuck its some kind f miracle high off of acid closed eyes and still champing ut fucking 10213123412315234 words per minute spit shit gook run when the mini gun spit whats that beeping. Cars too fast for my liking. Fuckers in such a hurry. Tempted to do more acid, feel like I&#039;ve not had enough to really be tripping son. But at the same time I think that this is just the tip and I should wait to take anymore to not fucking go nuts. But lola at the same time because who cares I only trip every so often and why not now. But this is really working this time no fucking dud shit. Dunno if its lucy but its something. Hppefully can sipher out useful info from tho after. <br /><br />my screen looks 3d.<br />title hash tag mamba muay thai kick to face subway scank grafting chiming bumda fucking owen shit fucking yoda.<br /><br /><br />Gunna trip balls to some fucking discovery channel shit fucking planet blue earth and shit knarsayinnnnnnnn gggg.<br /><br />Not actually high to the point of saying knarsayinggg but like to entertain the thought none the less. Why no music of its muted on you tubby silly me. Holy fuck this womans voice ad the astronauts. shit me son. Fucking wow just gonna sit and fucking trip balls brb son. fucking storms and shit now oooooh&nbsp; going full screen but don&#039;t wanna stop writing. Wait let me fucking configure this shit.&nbsp; Okay these noises first off. Not fucking cool guys I&#039;m super serial. Wait total feeling of sobriety. Like bummer dude all this is a placebo. Flat. Flat. Flat. Probably this nice and I&#039;m not done tripping just this bad juju fro test hurricanes and shit but can&#039;t stop watching whyyyyyyyy.Oh. Nice fuckng voice back again you crazy slut. You actually sound like you wanna burn down my life and take pleasure in it. Wank your clitty off. lolling at clitty. Okay skipping this shocking out hell boy 2.YEAH SPINNING EATH VISUAL. wow bummer dude fucking earthquake mashed the highway into little puffy cake. SHNU SHNU.&nbsp; kids voices triply. Sounds distant but i know its video but the back chatter seems more interesting. Not sure if voice is distorted, or my perception but feel fucking RADICAL.&nbsp; 2646 that building got marked son, knarrsaying G lol. hashtag iaintadarkybutiactlikeonewhilsthighforlols.<br /><br /><br /><br />Not too clever just snorted some MDMA but it was harsh on the nose don&#039;t wanna do that again it stings but i dunno i didn&#039;t take enough to have effect i prepped a bomb but think ill steer clear of it because my nose and throat just feel like they&#039;ve taken the hit<br />just had a tiny bit off the fork i used to crush it. Don&#039;t think I ever wanna do coke now at least haha. Hated that. Badddd juju. Hoping the feeling in my nose goes away so i can enjoy this trip clean. gnarl6 metal taste in my mouth too<br /><br /><br />gonna sit and chill for a bit, need to come down a tad. Glad i didn&#039;t take any more acid, think ill sit for, 20 minutes. till 920. Then see how I feel. Chopin nocturne no.2 in&nbsp; e flat major taking me to a quiet place.<br /><br /><br />903 puts in to perspective time, it felt ages but then I&#039;m on this new thought track and it doesn&#039;t. Weird simultaneous plain of existence. even if this isn&#039;t lcd I want to try it again because it has changed my view currently, which i think my friends will enjoy. (name edited) specifically I think has a similar eye to life as I do.<br /><br /><br />Weird tangent I know but i had a weird tab open from earlier and don&#039;t wanna mix the two so gonna go look at that tab if you know what i mean but . Yeah that was good. laughing as it finished, just in a kind of disbelief fuck i feel pumped i mean that x might be hitting i dunno feeling hot gonna open window and sit<br /><br />been away having fun, spoke to my girlfriend which i usually don&#039;t enjoy that much as of late. But it was refreshing, was worried at first id sound doped. Think I did but she was laughing too, it was a nice call. Went to look at pusheen but its unnerving. As is nyan cat. FUCK. THAT. SHIT. whilst tripping. Its one of those things i always thought would be ace on lsd but now i can&#039;t think of anything worse.<br /><br />Ic ant find the right music either. I hear stuff and its not what I want but i don&#039;t change it it just exists on another level of consciousness. I feel as if I find the right song it will unlock something. I don&#039;t know what type to try though, here we are at dub step. Tried some chopin (best so far) some rock, rap. Gunna try some pink ffloyd.<br /><br />Top rated on spottily is horrid. noises triply in a bad juju way. Cant stop saying bad juju after that documentary earlier. set the control to the something. Its got a bass line kicking in but its still edgy feeling. Don&#039;t like it but I love it at the same time. Its soothing now though like 58 seconds in. Surely this isn&#039;t actually pink floyd, if it is my dad has definitely taken acid to enjoy this music. It feels like it was written for acid takers. Like a trip of acid on a song. Its not a profound enjoyment, its just kind of a tour guide. comfortably numb. Sort of appropriate title. Horrible vocals. Fuck this PF shit What else can I try. John lemon?<br /><br /><br />silence bar the cars outside. That damp before the rain smell pouring through the shiftily installed windows. I love that smell it has a lot of memories. Kind of fresh, new scent. I remember smelling it after getting high with alex. Its one of the first things after the head fuck of shitty 00-s weed I can remember. A kind of fleeting wisp of something plastic being burned. But then it catches something woody and organic and an aroma unfolds. <br /><br />Dsx finvsz a`zh o sd fhinvz hsn i opsn&nbsp; lozs mh yd<br /><br />about to edi that out but its good, i knew i was spazzing but couldn&#039;t really focus on changing anything. Finding it harder to type, more of a slower thought process. <br /><br />kind of couch lock zone where i feel my hands are the only thing able to move but my eyes and my forehead which keeps waving every time i reach for ales than common keystroke. <br /><br /><br />another musical fucking cliche, all along the watchtower. lets see what happens.<br />darkness and the lights of outside bring a more kind of. expected trip. though when i close my eyes i see my last image fucking melting like a dali. typing felt like it was way off then, but surprisingly on. closed eye visuals confirmed, though not what i expected, more a, lasting image of your last eyes sight warping and all that fractal shit you expected. i love this i fucking love the fractal bends so much more intensely realistic than the video its so much more 3 dimensional things seem still but alive and the text seems clear but the meaning transcends vision and registers on a more neurological plane. Fire, jimi hendrix. Too energetic and fucking &#039;sally&#039; ish for me. MUSTANG SALLY. stuff like that. Need more bluesy I think. Try some coletrain, took me ages to find COLTRANE looking under coal train and all sorts. But, this is more my high kind of level. mellow. Fucking, sexy sexy sax. Classy and smoky as fuck, black and white, stockings, black lips. White white skin. Reds and pinks become dark blacks in film noir. Thats how I see it. The smell of the outside come snack again and the music takes a more, cheesy turn (1:34 in a sentimental mood duke wellington and coal train (autocorrect on ellington fuck the haters lol at beef wellington))<br /><br />How to describe this to someone. Interesting thought, hard to summarise. Will think introspectively later when I find the right song. <br /><br />Energy wanting to drum wanting to be a drummer and the movement makes my eyes feel nice. I feel like i need movement but its dark and boring. What to watch what to watch. I love this music. snuffy, coal trane. But the feeling of love quickly left after writing that. Now it feels hollow. Like the song is still playing after a murder, and you&#039;re investigating - hard to place but it feels like the game LA noire and Im investigating a morphine case you know the ones where the US military are involved, and there&#039;s this dude all washed up dead - could be a dame i dunno the deceased has no real part to play in this, just the setting and scene and. I enjoy the music again. It feels more energetic. And less false. But I want something else I feel. Coltrane face time is on, weird talking shocking me out. Fucking what the shit bro hang on gonna skip forward. ITS A RADIO INTERVIEW NOT COOL what the shit spotify. <br /><br />willie nelson on the road again what a fucking revelation.<br /><br /><br />that clapping at the end, felt phenomenal. I hate fame never liked the idea but the feeling then. Almost like I was something else, a performance worthy of a clap. Shadow of this window looks deeper than I&#039;ve noticed before. Interesting effect. The progress bar of spottily seems sporadic in its movements. Quite a fun game watching it tick along. Sometimes stopping sometimes fast. Find if sums up your neurological pathways in a trip I guess. Really fucking cool.. Wanna check out some iTunes visuals.&nbsp; <br /><br />nice visuals, feel like I&#039;m on a come down. If I&#039;m not tripping more by actually no i think i should stop any thoughts of further drug ingestion except either weed or valium and at the minute I require neither! FORWARD. I love this. I love this so much, I feel as if. I am so fucking happy that is was everything I thought it COULD be but it isn&#039;t anything I was dreading it WOULD be. Thank god. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dimensional. So fucking beautifully dimensional. So many different layers.&nbsp; Amazing to think of all the people before me, like the cia. What was it, MKULTRA. Really cool scene I bet, bunch of fucking druggies via funded,&nbsp; no worries of a bust. Simple music. Simple life. When you all step back from it what is life but the current moment you&#039;re living. <br /><br />This moment, among the best. smile ear to fucking ear. Head tripping, ears jazzing, hands, typing of their own accord. Want to see what song it is but its so beautiful. Cant stop listening. healing hands of time, put me on a downer checking out what it was but worth it for future listening.<br /><br />slow down old world. I lived too fast now its too late to worry, and I&#039;m too blue to cry anymore. Wow. Cold but hot but loving it. Kind of want either or but at the same time loving the conflict of feeling. Loving the car lights flickering up the walls half scaring half amazing me, loving nmy hands taking their own thoughts again loving the tap i hear beyond the music every now and then closed eyes now and moulding movements of the visuals but the music stays and my hands keep going but the music says slow down but my hands keep going but my mind is elsewhere and i. Songs over, lost that tangent. Will you remember me. gay name dude, gay juju vibes, next song. So much to do.&nbsp; Nicer, trickling tune. que sera sera feeling. Lovely.<br /><br /><br />Feeling of wanting everyone to try this. My family, but at the same time don&#039;t want them to. Fear of illicit behaviour. Dark tangent, prefer to avoid sadness.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Friends, sharing friends get back to that.<br /><br />(Named edited). Thoughts of (name edited) enjoying this. Hard to describe. Would love to be in the same house as him on lsd. Talking about how things seem, appear under influence. Critical thinkers are hard to find it seems. Big smile thinking of telling him this when sober, and subsequently this. And now a sick feeling at the pit of my stomach after watching that whole fucking paradox burn its self into the ground. I love this willie nelson, pulling me away from danger.<br /><br />If I&#039;ve learned anything - willie nelson. Best fucking trip buddy EVAR.Stoked I randomly thought of him.<br /><br />Why are you picking on me different feel, energetic. Kind of fucking empowering yeah why are you picking on me bitch watch me as I dance my fingers on this guitar. sudden bad juju fucking carnival vibes. DARKNESS II carnival vibes which is funny in a holy shit don&#039;t let me actually imagine that shit but funny if i did cause its lsd and its everything you&#039;d expect from a bad trip but its gone and now its on I let my mind wander, nelson. Fucking wow. I&#039;m pretty sure, I&#039;m pretty fucking sure that willie was tripping balls every fucking chord of this song. Fucking SMART. Big stretch, feel slow like a cat. Nice relaxing interlude. more stretches, want to elongate. Want to close window because of cold and that luring warmth on my back from the blanket but. At the same time i enjoy the clash of feelings. <br /><br />I would have happily died in that little bit. Happily &#039;let my mind wander&#039; at the 2 minute mark, would have happily had that as my last waking sensogram for this world. Oh fuck I wrote this world, i hope this LSD isn&#039;t turning me into a god-o-phile.<br /><br /><br />Ha no, wait for DMt for that. dark outside now, as dark as it&#039;ll be with the yellow streetlights outside. Wish I could see a different view but can&#039;t stop looking at the one i have anyway. Deeper meaning to that? PROBABLY LOL! Repressed emotions what you saying sucker. <br /><br />Weird joking way to deal with bad thoughts. That weird kind of gangster speech. Just stops me heading down a bad alley. But can&#039;t stop thinking about how. <br /><br />LOL I can, i can stop cause I just did and now its 22:24. Waiting time, willie fucking nelson all day.<br /><br />Laughing and thinking Im glad I didn&#039;t redoes, thinking before I won;d at 11 if i was still coming down. Its 2225 lol and I think I made a solid choice not redo sing. And this point I am thinking more, but then rereading and evaluating the fact that Im still having fun. Lets not fucking jepodize that. Cant even attempt to spell that, don&#039;t care for it neither. <br /><br />What a way to live, bad juju, skip.. Broken promises, promising opening. Wonder if they&#039;ll break down the line. Oh stop it you. Boring song, definitely not tripping music. NEXT. I funny how time, FUCK THIS, you wouldn&#039;t cross the streets t… can&#039;t see the rest. Erm, weird. Kind of elvis vibe. Not feeling it, waiting it out while I wait for this fart to arrive. Weird lol at the hope it is a fart and not a shit but then a wait a second feeling when you realise you&#039;re on drugs and could actually be a shit. Weird break of times when I think these things, then detach from reality like right now to type it then snap back and get the next feeling. Like I have bernards watch. But time isn&#039;t starting again this time. Need some car to go past please. There.&nbsp; But it felt fake. Wait. Ill look around for a bit bad juju. <br /><br /><br /><br />crossed my arms and felt the back of my really warm back, on an electric blanket on setting two so nice and toasty. cold hands warm back cross feelings weird but nice, wrong side of wrong. <br /><br />HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE SCIENTIST WILLIE NELSON WHAT IS THIS FUCKING SHIT HAHAHHA.<br /><br />WEIRDEST FUCKING SHIT. CANT STOP THOUGH. WEIRDING ME OUT TENSE STOMACH and the caps have warn off and now I&#039;m hollow and wondering who fuckign would do this, mad mad mad. Mad world actually reminds me of this. But still why you&#039;re raping willie. Changing and hoping willie helps me pass this HORRIBLE SHIT MADE IT TO 1:35 not having no more. <br /><br />Auditory like hearing binaural then taking off ears, like fractal lsd emulator for your ears I guess. <br /><br />skipped two bad juju nelson songs. This one seems nicer. Im going to lose a lot of something? Whatever he&#039;s losing he doesn&#039;t care too much. Nice feeling, matches my sentiments. <br /><br />woah actually he&#039;s talking about heartbreak<br />but in that kind of liberating jdgaf kinda way (anagram, solve that shit sober, eminem)<br /><br />Hollow carnival feeling but not bad juju. Just sad these times have passed. Think Id have been happier then. Simpler. Looking around now a lot of potentially bad juju things in my room. But, honestly a much more optimistic high than the media makes you think. Really wish my dog was here. Would love to have him sleeping and dreaming away. Miss cuddling him, actually quite sad and teary thinking about it. <br /><br /><br />Broken promises willie nelson, deliver me from that moment of sadness. 22:34. I keep amazing my self recording that time. I think I must be peak high. Past 30 minutes, most enjoyable. Ever? I dunno about that. On one level yes. Sad? Kind of, but. Fuck. This is good so not that sad.&nbsp; More temptation to do MDMA but then the nose feeling and I don&#039;t wanna again. This is kinda good. <br /><br />My own conscience and willie nelson. best trip buddies ever. <br /><br />Happy as a fucking happy kite. <br /><br />Weirdly sad lyrics matched with elvis-y 50s tone of nelson. Creates a nice juju. Lolling at my adoption of juju. Need to explain after, from documentary.<br />shiver cold cold.<br /><br />Covered up but window still open. Both ends of the candle on, feels like the song is part of the reason for the cold. Muted for the reminder. Want to hear the rest of the world. Cars, sound distant but know they&#039;re not. Hear different levels though, can trace one car into the distance, while another approaches, keep the two auditory threads separate. Though they go into a fuzz and hum and then i lose them. And then have to retrain my brain to stop hearing that buzz. Wonder how much i can actually follow them and how much is auditory tripping. Trace that one. still hear. new one coming, los tree of first, third one ;sassing. Second still on, third crossing and, second gone. third gone too.<br /><br />Probably do this al night, interesting but. Limited in its scope. Face of a fighter is on now. fumbled with keys a bit, hard to type slow juu=ju<br /><br />everything but you willie nelson. Still a bit slow juju but. too hot i think, will remove part covers…&nbsp; <br />22:40. Sad that the six minutes is gone. Want to keep feeling like this. Feel on a comedown. Past the peak I guess. time for some other music maybe thats it?<br /><br />Sigur ros. Always thought these guys aren&#039;t actually human. Hopipola, so fuckign what its the most popular and thus first on their playlist fuck you. <br /><br />want more visual stimulation. Music feels like auditory heroin - never taken it but how i imagine it - weird sober conscious interjected there. Feel safe though at the same time worried about personality disorder LOL just kidding would be sick to be friends with just me and my 5 conscious-es.<br /><br />WAnt to fbc (name edited) and tell him he HAS to try lsd but don&#039;t wanna be &#039;one of those guys&#039;.<br /><br /><br />macbook fan sounds like plane weird knocking noise. Fireworks? some distant popping I think, charger keeps fucking electrocuting me but only a little, don&#039;t really care for the trip without music. think thats fireworks but i don&#039;t like the apprehension it gives me. <br /><br />can&#039;t stop the curiosity though, fucking great. Gunna have to pop my head up and peek. Few composing last listens, I don&#039;t hear it all the time. Like someones locked out and knocking, half to keep them delf entertained, but again could just be fireworks. Peeking. definitely fireworks I hear the whizzing pop of the rockets. Wonder what for, maybe bank holiday weekend? Google see if anything local. could just be private. Oddly still got ill skills at googling. mind can&#039;t really make sense of results though fuck it. <br /><br />looking outside for what seems forever, weird sunspot vision. That light outside i will look at again tomorrow but now it is fucking fascinating, like a moth. Know I&#039;m on a comedown now can&#039;t really fight it though i suppose it has to happen, if i try to postpone it might turn into a bad thing and i have over it so far, will rebut and remedivcate and try some more. Still active though less hand being able to type. effort to type not to think, chopin in my head, want to listen to chopn and gorn out window.4 minutes of bliss. really still enjoying it, kind of stoned if i can put it that way couch lock, but nice music and still tripping and i cannot imagine normal life. i dunno if my hands are in the right place left hand yes 100 percent, right hand like. HAd a peek and sorted it.back on my back, (what) and headphones hanging off my head. Still playing chopin nocturne, b major. Another fart, tooth mother fucker. Sudden urge to detangle headphones around neck, probably for the best ha. Again I am a wicked trip partner. Find it weird because, like however long ago (recently but can&#039;t tell how long) I was thinking like fuck this is heavy come down this is it until I fall asleep and then wake up normal again. But now I feel like I did like earlier. That bad juju come down is exactly like when I was ill on holiday, passed out for like 48 hours straight. No contact with the world, weird dream. Dripping noise over and over, still have that recurring dream, net er seen the image again before now. Music has paused, weird crescendo of consciousness then fucking nothing. Lost my thought pattern, new song I guess. Chopin etudes n.3. Nice, slow, easing. headphones back on ears firmly to hear it. Preferred it in background though, bit too frontal with ears on. placing them in front. Cars in back. weird. Hovering on my head, above my ears, like the bottom cups on the upper part of my ear. good richrt place. Flashing visuals. Like a weird light somewhere flicking but i know its not. really dry lips know I need to drink but have no water, feel like drinking all the fucking pepsi I have round me not gonna cut it. Oh well. Wondering if theres any LSD related dehydratative deaths. <br /><br /><br />wondering how long this writing is. Wondering when i was first high. Like what, 230 I tried, failed until about 5-6. Il check when i messaged (name edited). 5 hours ago.so like, what 6 o clock that was!? That seems like, way wait i can&#039;t think what I&#039;m saying. It feels like i was affected actually what. I don&#039;t know, wait. Trying to think logically. I guess I started tripping around 7 then, 5 hours ago currently 2306 gives 1806 so whats that. fucking 24 hour clock isss 6. 606. Weird ju ju? never was the one for symbolism. 3oh3 for all i care. So were looking at 5 hours on the clock, definite come down feeling but not going to stop for another 3 hours from what I&#039;ve read. Amazing first half, wondering if the second will have this kind of. know I&#039;m tripping but can type with a sobriety kind of feel. Its like my mind, the conscious that I hear talk and my hands are separate, but i can still feel this cumbersome body with its ears hearing nocturne no.15 by elizabeth leonskaja. Some old sket that i don&#039;t care for much. But interesting feel, dissociative. Wondering if ketamine feels similar to the despondency i feel when I&#039;m not typing here, but sitting thinking I&#039;m about to sleep and then wake sober, but then not. hard state to explain. I know I&#039;m tripping, but I know i&#039;m on a comedown. Well i don&#039;t first time and all but it feels less intense and, &#039;uppy&#039; as it did earlier. But still, poetically beautiful. Still, every bit of it. Wholly wouldn&#039;t trade it. Chest feels fluttery and nice, worried about my heart for a second but a quick pulse check, can&#039;t really track time but not that fast its alarming. Clocking about 90 I guess, usually about 60 resting. Prelude no 15, d-flat major .Henrik Mawe on the keys. Decent guy. Bit showy. not in a flourish way, but, for show. Feel he isn&#039;t really a classical musician, rather a puppet. Playing for the sake rather than with feeling. Doesn&#039;t quite capture it properly. Weird because I have no critical care for classical music. I listen to cliches because it makes me feel nice sober. But, interesting on lsd. differently. Bored though, want to try something else similar. Try bach. Tocatta in d .<br /><br />okay comp spazzed out horrid juju hated that toccata, what was i think ng, tracks skipping out of control, spottily lag. Worst possible timing, on a trip lol whattt. force quit it, damn that nearly fucking had me dead. empty now its gone but shit that track switching. Urgh. Like vomitting a fucking pine cone. <br /><br />computer slow downy get why saving this restarting most apps, mc was open. okay seems normal, try firing up spottily again. tyler the creator, not a nice juju, probably enjoy that shit, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going through starred, nothing i like, sour taste in mouth disgusted look on face. first date, blink 182, could be interesting i suppose. Prefer another blink song though if were gun an, nope can&#039;t handle his vocals. Or ghost poet. need lyricalness stuff, abstract, not this fucking soliloquy bull.<br />agnes obel nice piano, but know her stupid mouth will , yep it opened. Sickly nice. Fuck it i actually quite like her, sorry i hated on you opening your mouth agnes. Weird name though so fuck you.<br /><br /><br /><br />feel like lord of the rings, when i close my eyes, like that scene where theres the dead things below water. feel like that, but peaceful, nice. water closed over and secure. But then the bad juju sauron business could turn that thought sour. cunt, just let me destroy the ring and carry on tripping son. Bitch even kinda looks like a frodo, cover art some weird thing. <br /><br />kind of sick looking back, want something else, feel she&#039;s a ghost. not liking the changing of noises, need to find something and stick to it. weird movement of juju, city and colour the girl guitar, getting me back on track. Such a pretty song. Closing window now, feel its right. Leave curtains open? Weird curtains could shop me out. Hm, try closed see what it seems like.fake and weird, rather open for now.cold. covers back up to my nose now. really interested to read this back sober. Feel kind of sober now actually 23:22. Defnitely coming down, think ill be sober by like 12. Asleep probably. Wake up tomorrow and reflect sad though I want earliers vibe to return. But still like this one. Feel tired like i need to sleep but active brain so can&#039;t. Think I will take some valium and head to sleep. See what thoughts i think before i sleep? Could be a bad idea, heading out from what I&#039;ve done all trip (sit and type with handsnot with brain, hands won&#039;t have anything to do so be bored. Hm, fuck it. ill keep pc on longer but close eyes and play around with music. c418, no words, mine craft music, weird. but you have to cut the dope. Good.feel like i want more acid but in the day, kind of annoying that its night i suppose. Want to sleep now, and then instantly be back when it was sunny and the clouds were dancer. quite a cold sweat i didn&#039;t notice. nose colder, interesting feeling with hands. nice to touch stuff<br />.weird come down can&#039;t really put my finger on it. <br /><br /><br />Think ill just puff some weed, drop a valium, see what happens. Nice open headed feeling, but all of a sudden clear headed sobriety. Mixed with a liberated head feeling now i got my headphones off. nice to touch my face, doesn&#039;t feel like my face so different perspective, feel ugly. sunken eyes, and weird small nose. up pointed too, and fucking cold. short and stubby face too though, kind of, round i guess. Still some nice feels actually, interesting patterns my windows cast on my walls. little stpory of its own?just like the clouds, the clouds a the start, little wispy. Perhaps I&#039;m nno wait where is the pattern. OH i se, vapour condensation on my window, and then light through it to the wall. That makes so much sense, just like a cloud, light through vapour. Wow. an x ray of clouds interesting view of hand want to look in mirror. weird to see self like that. shocked, my hair is quif mode engage. look kinda grinch sand the light is all weird in mirror can&#039;t stop looking though and then i looking at my self its weird looks like a silly mirror&nbsp; god damn i look creepy (doing it on purpose but damn I&#039;m creepy) Yeah weird angles, back looking outside, kind of bloated feeling in tummy, ate bread earlier, shouldn&#039;t have. Hum of fish tank, Weirdly, different, Depending on where I am. Definite audio sweetspot. Nice to move around that spot. Understand the pump a bit more. Probably not attached to glass enough, or low water level causing overtime on pump. H, outside looks so, cold and. I dunno I want to go out and be in it to feel like I&#039;m in snow but then i don&#039;t want to either. I wish I well not wish, next time would be cool to do outside. Have some walking and stuff, perhaps in (Location edited) with a few decent boys. Have points of reference i keep looking at to see what difference occurs, a house in distance, white and victorian in styling, seemingly different distances apart. sometimes in your face, sometimes, long long across the horizon. Feel as if i have a &#039;normal&#039; grasp of distance now. 23:39. So, what nearly 6 hours after effect? Defnitite come down, but i don&#039;t wanna yet. But don&#039;t wanna redose. Have to research about repeating doses daily (You cant, btw), definitely want to try this again. Need better stuff, more accurately dosed to be more scientific with it. I mean shit, I ate 6.<br /><br />Should have had more intense trip than that?! Feel like dosage WILDLY underestimated, probably ingested medium dose, maybe 150ug over all (CANT TELL NO POINT OF REFERENCE) But i dunno, when sourced legit vendor will start again with the dosage. One of x doesn&#039;t always mean one of y. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Clear, clear transit lines, Thats how it works then. Basic painting of stereoscopic vision, image on image, fractured in the right places, causes three dimensional when your brain trues to fill in blanks. But on LSD just see frame work. Missing &#039;the big picture&#039; but at the same time, seeing a picture so big it still has the staging apparatus in it. Fucking wisdom boy.<br /><br />gonna youtube magic eye, definitely more tripping to be had. Why is the net so SLOW. Urgh. That magic eye still there, still having wavy visuals like the nerve strobe. neave* neave* stop autocorrecting that damn it.Need to take out contacts….Interesting experience with the right. Didn&#039;t feel real when i was taking them out. Now can&#039;t see a fucking thing. Wonder if anyones ever documented the affect of vision and led before. Possible nice haha. Though can only speak through short sighted and corrected terms. Would need way more dosage and procedures to find correlation. For now feel blind almost. I am familiar with layout of screen but i am not looking at anything in particular. Kind of when you see a bli d person on tv and they move their eyes but you know they aren&#039;t seeing anything. Changed a lot of perception though. Text looks just like uniform lines, can&#039;t make out what it says looks aline, could al be gibberish. is it? no closer inspection says no. Still thirsty, never did drink thats a real danger you know. Gunna have to consume 330ml of pepsi, diet. Just to record what I&#039;m taking in my system.&nbsp; (note about message to emp) (all these brackets are thoughts i have my self and then need to put a note to try to remember to explain when i sober, not realising that I&#039;m actually still pretty out of it and can&#039;t rationalise these bracket fiascos so fuck it. ) DIRNK DRINK DRINK. Getting it now!<br />got it effort! wish i us had the bottle of water, empty now but wishing so much it was just like quarter full not heavy but rinsable. gotta put up with fizzy bullshit. tastes really fake like cola bottles, more thirsty than i realised, chapped lips were sign i knew it but didn&#039;t act - need to remember to have water next time - finally taken 10mg valium at 0029. Had some super come down worries about being fucking bad tripping so thought id edge it and let the vally guide me home. Gunna switch off pc now. Guess illl read this tomorrow: sober me. No regrets, every second of this, Ace. Would do this again and again. hopefully more profound net time. Hopefully more accurate, scientific. Don&#039;t want to sleep now i analyse it some more, but think i should stop and try to experience a quieter trip.. CMD S then shut the lid? See you tomorrow! Morning sober self, have fun?<br /><br />awoke 730, groggy, feel very unrested though no problems sleeping afaik. Very hazy mind set, vally still hitting strong. Slowly getting back to normal function though. Back at the end after reading this, at the time of writing the ending sentences I knew at the time my sober, morning self would have a little smile and feel really positive about the whole experience. And I do, one thing I&#039;ve taken from this is that I am definitely ready to start hallucinogens. My altered state mind and my consciousness are both friendly with each other, and it makes things very easy. <br /><br />To explain some of the shit in there would take ages. A lot of it is internal thought processes just put down without thinking. I kindly left my self some notes to help out. &#039;Juju&#039; is from a documentary I was watching earlier called Weed Wars. Someone leaves a mask outside their building and they keep saying it has &#039;bad juju&#039;. Not entirely sure why that kept coming up in my thoughts but juju is a real easy word to think when tripping, and to me (I also think this is the actual definition) it means the feeling or vibe of something. <br /><br />When reading it even the random interjections confused myself. There are song titles just jutted in there as the tracks change over. Willie Nelson is the by far the best music I heard all night, Chopin at times was nice too. Odd because whilst I recreationally listen to both of these artists at very low frequency, felt more into it that the songs I actually like whilst sober. There was a point in there that I was talking about &#039;Starred&#039; which is a collection of all my music. I hated nearly all of it, as I said i felt my face making a disgusted look. It will be interesting to see if my tastes change in sobriety. <br /><br />Some thoughts I remember being prominent in the trip were only recorded lightly here, more introspection was going on, like the parts about Family and my tests.<br /><br />Post read I can definitely tell the moments of sobriety to ball tripping must be &#039;waves&#039;. Cool stuff. Ages ago I was so worried to take acid because of what the TV tells you and all the bad shit I might see. But, in reality. I saw a lot of things that had me thinking &#039;oh shit wait is that going to send me on a bad trip?&#039; but they didn&#039;t. In fact if I was never told acid could give you nasty trips, I don&#039;t think I would have had one single bad thought. Just like weed, people say it makes you paranoid, but it&#039;s thinking that it&#039;s making you paranoid that makes you feel paranoid. Fuck it I can&#039;t explain I&#039;m still a bit hazy. It&#039;s nearly 9, going to save this and head off to eat. <br /><br />In a similar fashion. Tripping me: sober you still has no regrets.Still one of the best things he&#039;s done in his life and will definitely do again. All the feelings you have of redo sing or taking other drugs - don&#039;t. The trip is amazing and whole just by its self. Now, I can&#039;t wait to try acid again, but I know it won&#039;t<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Just a few clarifications. I for some reason found it of entertainment to speak like a black dude. Why? I don&#039;t know. Likely some form of media based impression that had happened in the past few days. There are a few personal jokes, like hashtags, that are super cringey to listen to but don&#039;t quite have the same socially disgusting connotations in real application. Also, the video I was watching I would highly recommend (where I talk about spinning earth visual, and a highway collapsing, I think you even got a Jedi Mind Tricks lyric in there as a bonus) just search: &#039;blue planet&#039; on youtube. It&#039;s a NASA Imax thing IIRC.<br /><br />Fucking well done to whoever makes it to the end of this entire thing (Likely no one). Thanks for reading!

				Sweet mother of trips, what a great idea to write while on it. I didn&#039;t actually read the whole thing (sorry, lack of patience) but it&#039;s such a familiar randomness. One should take some trip-logs and write a book out of it, hah! Nice one

				Yeah I never saw anyone actually writing whilst tripping. Thought I&#039;d give it a go but expected to phase out during. But my hands kind of disconnected from my body, I was typing without really thinking and still enjoying the trip. I also had the same thought on the come down, thinking about a whole live trip drug manifesto. Would be very cool to read, but also very incriminating....
