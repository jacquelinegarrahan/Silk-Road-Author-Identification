				It&#039;s not his!<br /><br />How I found out?

It&#039;s awe inspiring! :P<br /><br />I&#039;m guessing all his security listings, and offerings come from here too.<br /><br />All he&#039;s doing is passing them onto you, at a highly inflated rate.<br /><br />All what he says, all what he does, is complete and utter crap, he&#039;s just a middleman with a rather large imagination!<br /><br />And fucking clearweb, I really believed he&#039;d do better than that!<br /><br />I have posted this for everyone’s benefit, there are many good people on here, that deserve to know the truth!<br /><br />Gangsta #1 more like Middleman #2! :D

				I personally never thought it was his. I never had anything to gain by calling him out though.<br /><br /><br />If I were to be selling an armored vehicle, it would be way cooler then that thing.<br /><br />Hence the only aspect (and probably part of the plan) is to sell a PoS looking Armored Truck. It looks believable.<br />

				its been clear since day 1 to anyone with half a brain that limetless is just some big-talking tool. you think pointing shit like this out is gunna make any difference to the sycophants? hes been called out by smart people before, but you know the idiots here will keep riding his dick anyway b/c they like sucking up to ppl in &#039;power&#039;, even if all that power is just being a mod on a public darknet forum. good on you i guess for recognizing him for what he is tho, but still this thread wont have any affect what so ever imo

				Sorry, I didn&#039;t know Lim has been here long enough to go on multiple vacations where people are calling him out behind his back.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t read all 9000+ of his hilarious posts though.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too worried if he&#039;s LE or anything, he&#039;s just a forum mod and doesn&#039;t have any powers on the main.<br />He&#039;s been a pretty decent banhammer for some trolls, and that&#039;s all I really expect of a forum mod.<br />I don&#039;t look at the forum mods as directly representing DPR in any way.&nbsp; They all have different personalities and opinions.<br /><br />I do feel he was &quot;hired&quot; rather quickly, so I suspect the Limetless name is a pseudonym for another member DPR trusted when Lim appeared.&nbsp; I won&#039;t pass judgement without proof.&nbsp; Plenty of folks here grab pics and text from clearnet.&nbsp; I never really believed you could sell one of these using BTC without drawing attention anyhow.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it was more for bragging rights than anything, who&#039;s going to order that thing?<br />I should open a sellers account and post some fighter jets for sale.&nbsp; Delivery to Syria, no problem.&nbsp; 1,345,000BTC

				Where does Lim get the land rover from? Out of thin air? No. He has to source it from somewhere, and so what if he&#039;s being the middleman. Its not like he&#039;s asking or forcing people to buy it from him and not once has he claimed that he actually owns the land rover . He is probably just making it possible for the SR community if they wish to remain anonymous or buy using a different method when purchasing this land rover. <br />&nbsp;<br />You might as well start a thread saying LOOK I FOUND LIMETLESS&#039; MEPHEDRONE CHEMIST, ITS NOT ACTUALLY FROM HIM, HE IS JUST A MIDDLEMAN!

				If I were selling a car on SR you&#039;d be damn sure I&#039;d use a stock photo of the same model, whether it was mine OR I was the middleman.

Whats to say that Limetless does actually own one of these Land Rovers and he&#039;s just using the stock photo and description. Why would he need to make his own description up and risk his anonymity by taking a photo of his actual one (if this is the case)?

				Everything that has been said in this thread has already been admitted previously my Limetless himself in other threads. His said that pic and description was copied and that wasnt a picture of the one thats actually on sale.<br />Anyway before i get accused of sucking lims dick im the one in the Vlad1m1r thread asking serious questions about the timing of Lims &quot;vacation&quot; in correlation with vlads Scam. I also have some other infromation that gives me a clue maybe Limetless isnt coming back. But i really do hope im wrong.<br /><br />Its been a crazy day on the forums today

He is probably just making it possible for the SR community if they wish to remain anonymous or buy using a different method when purchasing this land rover. <br />&nbsp;<br />You might as well start a thread saying LOOK I FOUND LIMETLESS&#039; MEPHEDRONE CHEMIST, ITS NOT ACTUALLY FROM HIM, HE IS JUST A MIDDLEMAN!

				I could ask why ANYONE would dream of selling or attempting to sell something as traceable as an ex MOD armored land-rover on a drugs marketplace.<br /><br />If you really had this vehicle, and you really wanted to sell their are easier, less risky channels such as auction houses, Autotrader and eBay.<br /><br />If I wanted to buy such a vehicle do you think I would come to this website, or would I go to specialists? I&#039;m buying to protect my life or cargo. Surely that&#039;s worth doing properly, such as <br /><br />http://www.mod-sales.com/direct/vehicles/,37,/Armoured_Vehicles.htm<br /><br />Normal people come to SR for drugs, eBay for Chinese tat, and specialists for expensive armored vehicles. <br /><br />It just does not add up to me.

YOU will NEVER get your money back, and bitching about it only gives more negative vibes to the community. It&#039;s quite annoying to members who have nothing to do with it and don&#039;t care, and just see dumb shit all over the forum because of it.<br /><br />Lim on the other hand - If you have problems with him just talk to him when/if he gets back. Obviously none of us know the definitive truth, but whatever happens, happens. May as well sit back and watch. Bitching doesn&#039;t solve anything.<br /><br />Shroomeister - I like the way you think :)

				I have to chime in on this one...<br /><br />I build Rovers for off-road purposes and have several D90 NATO APCs. We rescued them last year from South America. They&#039;re virtually rust free but heavily damaged (nothing sexy - just wrecked) but with enough good material to build one. We picked them up for the Volvo portal axles and planned on scrapping the armor.<br /><br />Thinking out loud... They&#039;re newer than 2000 so they&#039;ll have to be titled as &quot;Agricultural Equipment&quot; due to import regulations on the Defenders. I could imagine a price around $50k(USD) with a 4 month build time.<br /><br />Anyone seriously looking for armor (or Rovers), let me know.

Now, maybe it&#039;s just me... maybe I&#039;m just an old man here, but in my day y&#039;see... in my day, copy-pasting something from one place to another did nothing to reveal who the copy-paster was. Maybe you kids with your newfangled anonymous internet connections and browsing.. maybe you kids figured out how to track down that one guy who at one point in time visited your website and SAVED an image from it and then POSTED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, as opposed to all the people who just visited the website... but in my day, that wasn&#039;t a thing.

Bunch of cocksuckers chatting about a supposed whore for so long, got anything better to do? The jokes on you!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Let&#039;s not distract from the facts, when lim comes back, I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll have the perfect expiation/excuse, I wouldn&#039;t expect any less from him, but then again I&#039;ve been disappointed before!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />P.S. moksha, what has this got to do with this post? How bizarre! Quite irrelevant too if you ask me!

I am not for or against your comment, I respect it, just like everybody elses here, everyone is entitled to their point of view, and nobody should be gagged or censored when it comes to a serious issue like this. Your post was a fair intelligent argument, compared to some very retarded responses here (that are becoming more retarded by the minute!), fair play! However, I have said what I needed to say in response, I have no need to expand or elaborate. <br /><br />Lim knows how to make coke, its well known. However, acquiring and importing the coca leaf into his country, due to sheer size and volume needed it&#039;s a very hard thing to smuggle in, and very risky business. But if he done that he would deserve his gangsta #1 status and some!<br /><br />He should, but he doesn&#039;t why?<br /><br />He&#039;s happier making his two bob, meow meow and ket, and selling it on at a highly inflated rate, I don&#039;t know if any of you know the profits he makes, it&#039;s insane! But fair enough, if he has business to be made here, he should make it!<br /><br />It&#039;s weird but IRL nobody I know wants meow meow or ket, they want cocaine and nice bud! <br /><br />Even everyone I knew that used to sell it gave up on selling it long ago! Maybe that&#039;s why he came here, not much business to be done with these IRL!<br /><br />Maybe in Aus they like it? As it appears he has a huge following of Aussie&#039;s, that have come out to defend him in full force today! I am unfamiliar with their drug scene, but I know that cocaine is way beyond their reach for most of them, at crazy prices, I remember reading somewhere it&#039;s $350 a g! WTF? And it&#039;s hard to get drugs into AUS, because their customs are very hot on this! In his country, definitely, M&amp;K are difficult drugs to sell, and don&#039;t have much cred as they were legal two years ago! Not very gangsta!<br /><br />Plus, he made the excuse before, that he&#039;s happy just cruising around with his baseball bat, and becoming a cocaine dealer would mean he would need to have stronger weaponry with greater risk! And then learn how to handle it, all these things take time, planning, and organizing! It&#039;s a different league!<br /><br />He is happy doing what he&#039;s doing, selling his two bob M&amp;K, and a bunch of other &quot;so called drugs&quot; he tried to market that nobody knew anything about or wanted, so he&#039;s stuck with them LOL!, and of course, coping and pasting his security listings from a clearweb website!<br /><br />If that&#039;s working for him fair enough, but everyone deserves to know the truth. Everybody on SR takes a risk, and it&#039;s all about &quot;limiting&quot; the lies and knowing the truth, quite literally!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />P.S. burn.notice? The hell? What is the link with your pictures to Lim&#039;s interests? Seriously, you need to go and start up another thread where, you can post pictures of girls and pussys to your hearts content, there&#039;s no link here between this and that! Get over it, and jog on with the rest of the retards!

However, I have said what I needed to say in response, I have no need to expand or elaborate. <br /><br />Lim knows how to make coke, its well known. However, acquiring and importing the coca leaf into his country, due to sheer size and volume needed it&#039;s a very hard thing to smuggle in, and very risky business. But if he done that he would deserve his gangsta #1 status and some!<br /><br />He should, but he doesn&#039;t why?<br /><br />He&#039;s happier making his two bob, meow meow and ket, and selling it on at a highly inflated rate, I don&#039;t know if any of you know the profits he makes, it&#039;s insane! But fair enough, if he has business to be made here, he should make it!<br /><br />It&#039;s weird but IRL nobody I know wants meow meow or ket, they want cocaine and nice bud! <br /><br />Even everyone I knew that used to sell it gave up on selling it long ago! Maybe that&#039;s why he came here, not much business to be done with these IRL!<br /><br />Maybe in Aus they like it? As it appears he has a huge following of Aussie&#039;s, that have come out to defend him in full force today! I am unfamiliar with their drug scene, but I know that cocaine is way beyond their reach for most of them, at crazy prices, I remember reading somewhere it&#039;s $350 a g! WTF? And it&#039;s hard to get drugs into AUS, because their customs are very hot on this! In his country, definitely, M&amp;K are difficult drugs to sell, and don&#039;t have much cred as they were legal two years ago! Not very gangsta!<br /><br />Plus, he made the excuse before, that he&#039;s happy just cruising around with his baseball bat, and becoming a cocaine dealer would mean he would need to have stronger weaponry with greater risk! And then learn how to handle it, all these things take time, planning, and organizing! It&#039;s a different league!<br /><br />He is happy doing what he&#039;s doing, selling his two bob M&amp;K, and a bunch of other &quot;so called drugs&quot; he tried to market that nobody knew anything about or wanted, so he&#039;s stuck with them LOL!, and of course, coping and pasting his security listings from a clearweb website!<br /><br />If that&#039;s working for him fair enough, but everyone deserves to know the truth. Everybody on SR takes a risk, and it&#039;s all about &quot;limiting&quot; the lies and knowing the truth, quite literally!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />P.S. burn.notice? The hell? What is the link with your pictures to Lim&#039;s interests? Seriously, you need to go and start up another thread where, you can post pictures of girls and pussys to your hearts content, there&#039;s no link here between this and that! Get over it, and jog on with the rest of the retards!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have absolutely no fucking idea what your on about....but ill try.<br />this is a stupid thread beacause most of it is rambling nonsense (see above) , the subject title was addressed ages ago by lim when he was here and was pointed out by page 2, yet has continued on with nonsensical crap for another 5 pages.<br /><br />Anyway some things need to be addressed both in here and in the vlad1m1r thread. Such as why gangsta number 1 sells meph and not coke.my thoughts would be that there would be more profit in coke then meph. but maybe im wrong. maybe over in the UK meph sells for some ridiculous price per gram and you guys cant get enough of it. if not than is very suspicious that someone with as many claimed connections as limetless doesnt sell &quot;harder drugs&quot; it just makes logical sense, and i suspect something fishy so if you could answer this simply without some rambling post that takes me half an hour to read and is completely in decipherable that would really be great. K Thanks :)

				Oh my fucking god mate really, have you not read my posts before this one? She goes and accuses Lim of being a liar when she has no evidence. I&#039;m not saying he does or does not have a LRover, I&#039;m saying that she shouldn&#039;t go accusing Lim without any proof, trying to make him look bad etc when he probably hasn&#039;t done anything wrong at all.. I&#039;d also like to add I&#039;ve had a few transactions from Lim and they have been flawless and the product was some of the best quality I&#039;ve ever used. <br />

				Reading this thread is like watching a doubles match of accusation tennis. On one side of the net are players kryptoz and gtgeorgz up against the equally talented pair of punkstOner and SocialBombshell. Each team firing some big serves at one another, with a few aces thrown in from both sides of the net, however equal to the task are the powerful back hand and forehand returns,&nbsp; both cross court and down the line. The question remains as to who will produce the big, overhead SMASH to win the tournament on match point, bringing the match to it&#039;s conclusion.<br />I follow the adage in life of &quot;If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it&#039;s a duck&quot; I, like many others , will be interested to see who was actually correct in regards to the accusations that have been made but on the face of it thus far, I must say things look a little grim for Lim. We&#039;ll see soon enough so until then, post away. :)

				What exactly is your problem TallTits?<br /><br />He fucked you off because you obviously have psychopathic bunny boiling tendencies and a blatant disregard for your own personal safety - get over it. I&#039;m not defending him in any way, this is the conclusion I have reached all by myself after reading your posts. Well, that and the fact when he&#039;s back (!) he&#039;s grown up enough to defend himself.<br /><br />Just give it up. Really. You just look stupid pulling this shit.

Would he just take the money and run off with the vehicle in his own name RD? I don&#039;t think so RD, wouldn&#039;t be a good move for him, would it? Sounds like a checkmate if you ask me!<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe he went on about all of his security skills, and he got it all from a clearweb website.

Divide and Conquer? the fact that both vlad and lim have access to vendors information. Vlad had vendors addresses who were cashing out through him and Lim&#039;s method money laundering could be made up to profile who e uses it, i.e. Another way to identify Vendors. LE is never going to kill this idea while people are united for it, and they know that. so there best option is to turn everyone against each other and create a huge sense of distrust in not only this communitty, but the ones that succeed SR when they finally manage to take down the physical server. that would be a physical attack and this could be psy-ops

				Right, so if you never did business with him or vlad, who cares. Even if he is a mod, forums and SR are two separate entities. I really don&#039;t see a problem, and if it&#039;s psy-ops, stop complaining about it and continue with whatever you do :). Not trying to hate on your opinions, I really just cbf to care either way.

Ok well psy-ops doesnt work on you or me, but works on 90% of other people. there will be no community left to give a fuck that we didnt give a fuck? See where im going with this? yes this thread is stupid. you dont like lim, thats fine, aparently a fuckload of other people dont like him either, most likely based on his opinions on here, yet nobody says a word normaly and he is held in high regards. kmfkewm gets flamed constantly for his opinions and his one of the biggest contributors to SR and probably the wisest in this field. So this is showing that questions need to be asked if there is a suspicions (even if they are completely innocent) about a moderator. <br />And btw this stupid thread isnt the one to do it go to the vlad1m1r thread at least there&#039;s some interesting shit in there

So what if they scare 5 people on the forum who gives a flying fuck, no one that&#039;s who.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />95% of vendors are here, thats the important part.<br />What else could&nbsp; limetless do to be a better moderator? his the only one i ever see anyway. Ive just got some wee concerns about his access privleges and seeming he couldnt even delete threads i imagine there shouldnt be any concernsbut some confrimation would be good anyway.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, I see what you&#039;re saying but if I can clearly see through their pathetic bs I&#039;m sure the vendors can too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />well at the moment it appears like its slowly turning into team-lim vs team anti-lim so yes it is working. thankgod none of mosts respected members have taken sides.<br /><br />Anyway could anyone suggest what Lim didnt do that would have made him a better Mod? inb4 conflict of interest aswell as thats already been <br />mentioned and probably established seeming he spruik his ML service abit.Still waiting on some more conformation of how good he claimed he was at that........probably not the best thread, the fact its gotten 12 pages is a miracle

				You are either very stupid or very smart, Social. In either case, yes, &quot;Lim copied it&quot;.<br /><br />And that compromises him how? Because, as I made quite clear and as you either are too stupid to understand or too manipulative to take correctly, there is no way to track, among the many visitors to whatever site Lim copied his shit from, what exactly is the IP address of the person that actually copied it versus simply the people who viewed it.<br /><br />Something which anyone on these forums should be more than aware of, and yet you act so seemingly incapable of even fathoming the possibility of it.

				Because this forum has become infected with mugs like yourselves....This whole Lim thing is irrelevant. It makes no sense that because Vlad left a scammer that if he was Lim too, he would have no reason to leave, is anyone actually gonna buy that Land Rover? Id probably doubt it so why care so much? If a man can get those things, why not advertize them for profit? There seems to me to be no foundation to any of these accusations. I don&#039;t know Lim, but I&#039;m certain he is a drug vendor here who never asks to FE except under exceptional circumstances as most other vendors here do......<br /><br />What exactly is this whole thing really about SB? You are just pissed off as you tried so hard to beg us guys to be friends, Lim your man (he posted msgs you (TT) had sent him by the way which were amazingly mental) and got rejected from our little corner of the forum because you talked nonsense and we didn&#039;t get on.....Now you are some rampage against Lim on the forums as another handle, thinking you are smart acting like it aint you but its amazingly transparent to everyone here.....This is why I&#039;m posting this Punk. It&#039;s all pointlesssss.

I mean, TT/Social is all up IN these forums, twisting her clit to get off to how hard she&#039;s convinced folks to doubt Lim.<br /><br />And that&#039;s AFTER Lim force-fed her some humble-pie she so richly deserved.

I&#039;m not a Limetless-customer. I&#039;m just a person who has talked with Lim a few times and liked what I saw. Sure, that doesn&#039;t really put me in a good position to be talking about how he is as a vendor... but by that logic, the same is true of you and Social. Or you, yourself, and you.

Got to love your logic!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Point is, Lim is held BOTH in high esteem as a Vendor and as a Mod, when a person of this description, is playing some underhand tactics, they need to be exposed into the public forum. So, none is at risk, or gets compromised. Security is very important, and when the clearweb becomes involved it&#039;s very sensitive! <br /><br />How many people here have googled sh!t on other people here, or how many people has Lim exposed for his own benefit?<br /><br />So, how many people here are being traced/tracked down at any one point here? You should do a poll on that, I&#039;m sure you&#039;d find the speculation, and suspicion interesting, as it seems to be a favourite topic of yours!<br /><br />I have no need to track him down, I already know &quot;everything&quot; I need to know, and I shared it! <br /><br />I will say, facts are facts, and evidence is evidence!

				Not surprised at all you went THOSE lengths to try moksha, you must keep your great leader satisfied! It&#039;s hard to get stuff down under, so you must be desperate to please him! I&#039;m sure he is most amused. And it took you a week to find that post? Bravo indeed! :)<br /><br />Still, there&#039;s a bunch of other questions, out there that need to be answered. Just look around you, this is NOT the only one! The scandal is off the scale!<br /><br />It is still HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL to copy words and pictures for word from a cleaweb site, it&#039;s IMPOSSIBLE to have an X Mod Land Rover to EXACTLY THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS as the &quot;real one&quot; on the clearweb. THIS makes THAT listing a lie!<br /><br />If he wanted to be honest about that, he should have added it to his listing, COPIED DIRECTLY FROM THE CLEAR WEB, and give potential buyers the option!<br /><br />But that would have sank his Gangsta #1 credibility to the floor!&nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />I wonder how much interest that would gain? Most here avoid the clearweb like the plague! And affiliating a blackmarket vendors account directly to it, is bad news!<br /><br />Not everybody on SR uses the forums, right? Or would bother to search to your lengths to find the answer. It&#039;s dishonest!<br /><br />In fact your defense, it&#039;s all the more suspicious and suspect now!<br /><br />By the way, if he really owned an X MOD Land Rover, which he says he&#039;s got one, he would knew the specs, and he would be able to phrase it in his own words, but did he NO? <br /><br />Why? Because HE KNOWS NOTHING about X Mod Land Rovers! It&#039;s obvious now!<br /><br />Thank-you for sharing! ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=39482.msg450147#msg450147">Quote from: moksha on September 05, 2012, 08:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lol yeah probably should&#039;ve looked though his post from a week ago instead of wasting your life SB, we&#039;ll let you get back to filling the empty void in your soul with penis now. <br /><br />Un-fadeable indeed ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Fill my soul with penis?

You&#039;ve done nothing but repeat yourself using different accounts for 22 pages yet we all still firmly believe you&#039;re crazy... unless that was your intention all along in which case my theory turns out to be true. ;D

You lose.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sorry, can&#039;t help my amazing memory, it was great for exams, and still serves me well today!<br /><br />No, I am the winner of the &quot;grand prize&quot;! I said from POST #1 IT&#039;S NOT HIS, now it&#039;s been proven! Winner wins! :D<br /><br />The argument/speculation is why copy his listing word for word from the clearweb? <br /><br />When he surely knows the specs of his own X Mod Land Rover?<br /><br />It&#039;s clearly been customized, and there&#039;s no way on earth his has been customized EXACTLY the same to look like that. It&#039;s pretty unique!<br /><br />But I guess your knowledge of X Mod Land Rovers, isn&#039;t much, nor is his, that&#039;s why he copied it word for word!<br /><br />Would you trust buying from someone that knows obviously NOTHING about his product? And has linked his blackmarket vendors account to a clearweb site? If I was the original owner of that vehicle, and I found out, someone stole MY picture and wording for their own benefit, on the fucking darknet, making my vehicle associated to criminal activity, I&#039;d be mighty pissed off!<br /><br />You call me lazy? A highly esteemed vendor and moderator coping a listing word for word, and picture, is fucking lazy! He is putting himself at risk (if the original owner finds out, it&#039;s fraudulent), deceiving his customers, and letting himself down as a trustworthy vendor, and (I&#039;ll use this term very loosely) as &quot;businessman&quot; too!.<br /><br />No, I had no need to trawl through his 8000+ posts to find the answer, I simply went onto his listing, knew the language used was way too &quot;intelligent&quot; for him, and guessed it was copied word for word. A 20 second search on google proved my thesis to be correct!<br /><br />There is no mention on his listing, that this is NOT his X Mod Land Rover and/or it&#039;s copied from the clearweb. It&#039;s misleading and deceiving!&nbsp; :(<br /><br />What if I want THAT X Mod Land Rover, exactly as it&#039;s advertised, oh wait I can&#039;t have it, it&#039;s not HIS!<br /><br />WTF am I spending $105,000 on then? Fresh air?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />I wonder what his refund policy would be that I didn&#039;t receive the actual vechile???<br /><br />The argument that somebody was posted a while ago, they want the exact same gram as in the picture, would get it, it&#039;s the exact same gram, taken from the same batch, so yeah, that would be the truth!<br /><br />But that X Mod Land Rover is a different kettle of fish, it&#039;s not his, he doesn&#039;t own it, there&#039;s certainly not another one like that, it&#039;s fraud at it&#039;s finest!<br /><br />I hope he never lists it again, if he does everyone knows the truth about his &quot;lies&quot;.<br /><br />BR haven&#039;t you got your hands full? You have other Lim/V/SR/PS issues to address, there&#039;s a lot more to it than THIS you know!<br /><br />But we have established it&#039;s a lie, great work team! When there&#039;s a lie, there&#039;s normally more than one! How many will there be?

I like this point, actually. It doesn&#039;t have any conjecture or ulterior motive to it. It&#039;s a GOOD point. If Social was able to make points like this, that don&#039;t have conjecture and ulterior motives, I&#039;d never have had a problem with her.<br /><br />But Punk, she hasn&#039;t been interested in discussion. I made plenty of good points against her, but she ignored every one. The only things she replies to are the parts she can twist around in an attempt to benefit her.<br /><br />And my problem with you, Punk, is that you don&#039;t care about the many problems with Social/TT. Beyond calling her out as TT, you don&#039;t care about her ulterior motives. You care that Lim&#039;s attitude is analogous to a pufferfish&#039;s self defense, but you aren&#039;t concerned with the equally-harmful actions of Social.<br /><br />You lack consistency. You don&#039;t act like you care about the Road. You&#039;ve not been unbiased. You&#039;ve been anti-Lim and pro-Social. That&#039;s why I keep accusing you of being Social.<br /><br />Edit: My point for you, punk, is that if you care about the Road, you should be equally concerned about the shady and suspicious tactics Social keeps employing. And the fact that she reeks of LE. I don&#039;t care that you&#039;re anti-Lim. I care that you&#039;re pro-Social, when Social is very much not pro-Road.

				Another point I&#039;d like to make is that Lim is the single money-laundering &quot;expert&quot; that can be hired on the Road, now.<br /><br />From an LE-standpoint, getting everyone against Limetless vastly reduces the purchasable knowledge available to the many drug-dealers.<br /><br />In other words, there is every reason for someone who is LE to go after Lim.

Are you sure you belong here? If you can&#039;t even insult someone properly, why are you on a drug forum? So what if we speak about drugs in our thread, THIS IS A FUCKING DRUGS FORUM YOU NONCE. Surely even a kid can figure that out?<br /><br />Social is some hoe who is obviously mentally unwell. She has something against Lim, and she&#039;s made numerous attempts at ruining his reputation. Now that he&#039;s away, shes made this thread to gain an unfair advantage.<br /><br />I&#039;ll like her the day her tits can actually stand up! Lol.

				ok, dumbass. i just read the first page again - where exactly is this burning question that eludes me so? <br /><br />as i already said it&#039;s just finger pointing and baseless accusations.<br /><br />and the vlad thread? what, you honestly think vlad and lim are either the same person or are in some way connected? even the fucker that first brought it up has admitted its a far fetched theory.<br /><br />and you&#039;re soon to be a vendor as well? under the same name? good luck with that

				Oh and as well, SocialBombshell, TT or whatever the fuck ya wana call yaself is only doing this is because we had a bit of sex chat on TC and she showed me her vag and then when she suggest meeting up and pretty much having a relationship she got parred. End of story. <br /><br />Oh and as a little footnote. Me being connected to Vlad? Fuck that. I wouldn&#039;t change BTC for cash on here if someone put a gun to my right nut. I get asked to do it all the time and please, feel free to ask the Admin to skim through my messages and they will see it&#039;s always a flat NO. I mean fuck me the guy was encouraging people to set up offshores in Belize which is one of the blacklisted offshore nations, he didn&#039;t know his arsehole from his elbow. Many a vendor has said that they wouldn&#039;t have known where to start with the system publicly, Delta11 for one and I find it fucking bemusing that Souldout can comment on the service I provide when he hasn&#039;t actually bought it and is just using it to jab his anti-capitalism views which he has voiced many a time on this forum. For those who were suspicious because he disappeared just before I went on holiday I hope that suffices. <br /><br />Now then if all is said and done I&#039;m going to carry on with my evening.

				I&#039;m so happy my vote was the one to put lim in the lead. He has always been helpful to me and does great work with the forums. What else matters? I don&#039;t care if he is selling battered unicorns to demented midgets as long as he does the job he is been chosen to do by our fearless leader DPR. So all the bullshit aside he does good work and that should be all that matters. I don&#039;t ever post unless I feel strongly about something usually I just sit back and laugh at all these crazy people but this was insane. Just let the guy do his job and forget about the petty BS!

				I noticed since my little post disclosing the sex-chat the OP hasn&#039;t made a sound. Anyone else find that as interesting as I am? <br /><br />Forgot to add that she also persistently asked what my real name etc was multiple times so we could be &quot;proper boyfriend-girlfriend like&quot; and then when other parties exposed her as an escort she sent me some crazy-as-ten messages about how she was my woman and I had to protect her or something. Showed them to Raoul Duke and Shiznit but I&#039;m not sure if they still have them.
