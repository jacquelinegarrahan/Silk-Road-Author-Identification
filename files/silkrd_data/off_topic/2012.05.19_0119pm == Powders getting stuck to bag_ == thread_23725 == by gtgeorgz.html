				This may sound stupid but... Whenever i have powders and even some crystals, such as mdma, coke and mephedrone, there always seems to be a layer of very fine powder that sort of sticks to the side of the bag, how do get this stuff from inside the bag so i can use it? Or is it just me being an absolute cheap stake and its not worth the hassle of attempting to get it as its so little?&nbsp; :o<br />discuss..

				Well you can scrape it off with a credit card or something just turn the inside out first.

				Just use your finger to get it of the card again over a mirror or whatever most will land on the mirror and the rest you just lick of your fingers. Though if it enough to be worth the hassle you need to judge lol. Some substances will be more prone to stick to the bag. Like amphetamines so then it would be worth it imo

				i&#039;ve once received from a canadian rc-seller some stuff which was inside &quot;tan baggies&quot; where anything stick to it... don&#039;t have a clue, where they are buying the stuff? maybe, i&#039;ll write them an email one time... the baggies you get in headshops and stuff are the problem... it&#039;s true, always a fine layer of powder sticks to the baggie... personally i&#039;ve changed my packing method now, because some users feel very annoyed by the fact, that the powder sticks to the baggie... i use &quot;window seal&quot;, these are special &quot;expensive&quot; papers with a some kind of plastic layer, where no powder sticks to... + if still one time powder sticks at, you can scrub it off with a 2nd &quot;window seal paper&quot;... they are the best stuff you can get to carry a max. of 1gr. of powder inside... very clever for parties + so on... a good collegua of mine told me, that he has forgotten to take out &quot;window seal paper&quot; once he put his jean into the washing machine... when he has taken it out in the end, the &quot;window seal&quot; was still in order!!! greetins

And licking mdma and other such chemicals just isn&#039;t pleasant haha. And as for coke, it would just be pointless licking that off the bag!
