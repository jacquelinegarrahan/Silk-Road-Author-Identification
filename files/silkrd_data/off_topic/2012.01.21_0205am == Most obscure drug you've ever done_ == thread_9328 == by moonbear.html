				Jimson weed can be dangerous. I transplanted a couple from near a lake to a garden in front of my dad&#039;s house and took it a few times several summers ago. It&#039;s not worth the risk. There are many better substances to try.<br /><br />The hallucinations are very different from classic psychedelics. It was most like dreaming while awake. Auditory and visual hallucinations that seem real, but for the most part were entirely mundane. I would see or hear my friend and go to talk to him only to find out he wasn&#039;t there. There are many bad side effects including blurred vision, flushing, overheating, rapid heartbeat, and the worst dry mouth ever. It tastes absolutely dreadful like chewing up a bitter pill. I don&#039;t remember long portions of those days. Was going to try DXM and Jimson weed together, but on a low dose of both I saw demons in my blinds so I decided to end that experiment before anything really bad happened.<br /><br />One problem is plants can vary dramatically in potency depending on climate, age, health, and genetics. I had a similar issue judging doses with San Pedro. One time, 2 cuttings gave me an amazing trip, while the next 3 cuttings only provided a modest experience. Unless you grow them and know them, be extra careful how much you dose. <br />

				A good rule of thumb is 500mg/ 12 inches of San Pedro. You can just stew it up with a bit of citric acid and neck the sludge, a full extraction is quite a lot of work. Peyote buttons take a really long time to mature (like 5 years) and are quite expensive. San Pedro can grow several feet per year.<br />I&#039;m trying to find some synthetic mescaline for a reasonable price (like not 60 quid a gram). I sold 10g of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde a few years back for a pathetically low price, wish I&#039;d hung onto it!<br /><br />If you are interested in deliriants, diphenhydramine is safer than tropane containing plants as you can regulate the dose much more easily.

				Ibogaine sounds interesting. It can also produce lucid dreamlike effects. Make sure you have at least 2 days because it can last a long time. It&#039;s for sale here, but quite expensive.

				Have tried coca leaves, raw poppy pods, blue lotus, HBWR. HBWR, well was enlightening and an excellent aphrodisiac (like MDMA), except for the nausea and headache.

Meaningless experience with a lot of beautiful visuals, but that&#039;s not what I&#039;m looking for. Changa is different. You are more grounded, connected with cosmic-planetary consciousness or whatever you call it (same thing happens to me on mushrooms), visuals are very organic and strongest I&#039;ve ever experienced (my friend says it&#039;s comparable to 100mg of 4-AcO-DMT). Transition is ultra fast yet very smooth, you literally feel the expansion of consciousness. Don&#039;t do changa if you are not a vegetarian - most meat eaters report terrifying visions while on changa (probably an effect of jungle DMT). I would also like to notice that my changa was made by &quot;father of changa&quot; from Australia, so experiences may vary depending on person who prepared it and ingredients. I&#039;m planning to prepare my own changa in the near future, maybe even sell some on SR.
