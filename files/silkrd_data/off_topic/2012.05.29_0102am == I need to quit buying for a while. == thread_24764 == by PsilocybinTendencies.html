				I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m sharing this with you guys.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been here for two months and I feel silk road has had a negative impact on my life.<br /><br />Not from the drugs themselves.<br /><br />But on my finances.<br /><br />I love this place and I&#039;m having a blast but I can&#039;t afford to do this :(<br /><br />I want to do a gram of REALLY good coke, and I want to actually roll (I&#039;ve tried to roll three times off this site and failed!) and I want to try DMT.<br /><br />I figure it will take me another month maybe two to get those things in.<br /><br />Then I have to reduce it to the bare minimum. Weed. Maybe hash if I find it more efficient (trying that for the first time soon), and on rare occasion when I feel I have enough and deserve to treat myself, LSD.<br /><br />I feel like it&#039;s going to be an incredibly tough addiction to break.<br /><br />Not the drugs themselves,<br /><br />The thrill of buying them online. But I need to chill and allow myself enough money to stand a chance of making it to a place where I can afford a nice little drug habit.<br /><br />I wish I could figure out a way to better myself faster&nbsp; :(

				Can&#039;t say I blame you. ;) The key here is definitely patience though, but I definitely understand how difficult it can be considering how easy purchasing is. Just restrain yourself, and pace your drug use out and it&#039;ll get easier. Once you&#039;re able to firmly tell yourself no, it becomes a breeze! Good luck with your &#039;addiction&#039;, haha! ;D

				yeah i feel the same dude :&#039;( i&#039;m always low on money now that i know about silkroad.. but this is also true IRL with other drug dealers. Sometimes a break is a good thing to do, personally i wrote on a calendar when i take drugs and the amount i taked, this help me realize when i&#039;m out of control with my drug habit. I hope this can help you !
