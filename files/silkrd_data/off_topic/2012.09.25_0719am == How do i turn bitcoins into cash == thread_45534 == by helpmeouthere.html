				Set up a bitcoin selling service. Invest $400 into a website, post your site on bitcoin sites and people will buy from you.

If you&#039;re unlucky, you&#039;ll probably blow up so use some caution and have some benzo&#039;s to hand to cool the nerves.<br /><br />Other than that, what the guy above said.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>+1 because that just made my day ;D

				Lol, the world is better when it&#039;s a more direct place. :P <br /><br />And it depends exactly what you want. I have specific set prices for my consultations on here for BTC laundry yes but something as bespoke as what the OP is talking about I&#039;d charge more for because it&#039;s much more complex and requires a lot of planning and I&#039;d have to design a structure for it that would be viable to cope with those figures. <br /><br />If you are dealing drugs IRL and need a solution that is a different thing and different people need different solutions. It sounds a bit vague but it depends on how much, how often and what your present situation is.

				Clegg makes me laugh man, he&#039;s just the definition of the term &quot;Massive fucking LIABILITY&quot;. I mean clearly he knows that he&#039;s basically someones tea-boy and resents the fact, which is only natural I guess. The problem is though every time he says some stupid shit because he stopped giving a fuck because he resents his job he loses credibility so he&#039;s fucking his party over so when the next election comes round they&#039;ll be fucked. You know for a fact that Dave and George do an eye roll and just shout &quot;FOR FUCK SAKE&quot;.
