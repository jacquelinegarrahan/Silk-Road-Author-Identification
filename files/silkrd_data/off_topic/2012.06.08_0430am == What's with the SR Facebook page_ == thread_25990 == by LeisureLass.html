				All cops (DEA,CIA,FBI) know about the existence of Silk Road since it was on TV at ABC Action News or in other TV documantaries.<br />Im 100% sure that right in this moment 100´s of IT professionals are working under high pressure to kill Silk Road.<br />It doesnt matter that there is a site on Facebook or You Tube Videos.Silk Road is no secret.The more people find Silk Road, the more people use TOR.<br />And the more people use TOR the more securer it is for Silk Road because the network grows up.More people=more anonymity<br />We can help and support Silk Road if we create own TOR servers and build TOR-bridges to help other people to connect.

				I saw that stuff a while back and I assumed that it was a created by LE to monitor and build a log of anyone that might interact with the facebook page. They could then use that list as an additional tool to help track who is who on SR. (comparison of related storys, handwriting flaws, ...ect).<br /><br />Gotta keep that tinfoil on tight.

				OMG!&nbsp; What if they aren&#039;t going to cross reference those that visit the pages, what if they&#039;re profiling those who avoid it!<br /><br />LOLZ<br /><br />Seriously, the best idea is the one posted above.&nbsp; Convince more folks to use TOR period.&nbsp; They don&#039;t even need to use the road to obscure things more.<br />Convince your family and friends that TOR is the safest way to browse, for anonymity and for avoiding malware/phising.<br /><br />AD

				I actually stumbled into SR on a total fluke. I had always heard of &quot; Deep web &quot; AKA using the .onion network.<br /><br />And after some google searches, i found the hidden wiki, and went through all the drug sites, and some of the Hacking sites to, until i stumbled into this fine establishment :D
