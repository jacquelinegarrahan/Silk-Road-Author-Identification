				Lets talk about being homeless. Seriously. Some amazing and wonderfully fun things have happened in my life on the streets. If anyone else has some funny shit to get the ball rolling pipe in. <br /><br />I was living under a bridge for awhile at one point in my life. And actually it wasn&#039;t one of the worst times of my life at all. I always had enough money for food by working temp jobs. Staying clean was hard but I got by. Drank cheap vodka and beers. Grilled out. (not rats I promise) Had laughs and made new friends. <br /><br />I know I can&#039;t be the only motherfucker here who has been homeless.

				I&#039;ve been homeless as fuck several times.&nbsp; At first it was a blast.&nbsp; When it happens nowadays, it kinda sucks, though these days I&#039;m way more prepared than back then so it&#039;s not really a shock when it happens.<br /><br /><br />Most memorable moment.&nbsp; Ridding trains from east to west.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I&#039;m not homeless, but having a home isn&#039;t all that. <br /><br />Let me explain...I just recently paid off a 3bdr condo after 10 yrs of a land contract I had with the owner. In other words, the &quot;rent&quot; I paid actually went toward the principle of the owners loan. When it was paid up, I own it.<br /><br />Now I am responsible for the tax and insurance on my place...which amounts to $350 a month, if averaged out.<br /><br />Which kinda sucks, considering I was paying only $550 for the monthly contract.<br />

				I&#039;ve never been homeless. I have to have a bed. Haha. Back is too messed up to sleep on a street or anything.<br /><br /><br />I do have a friend that is, what I call, &quot;intentionally homeless.&quot; By that I mean that he chose to leave his home and travel the country, visiting state after state by bumming rides and money off of people, or making money playing the guitar on the street. He occasionally will find a library now and then and gets on facebook to let everyone he left behind know that he&#039;s safe and alive. He always has the greatest stories ever too. He just will not stop talking about the fact that being homeless is the greatest thing he&#039;s ever done.<br /><br />Looking back at the way that particular friend handled every day, &quot;have a home,&quot; life, he is way more suited to be doing what he&#039;s doing now than to have a 9 to 5 job and to have a place to call his home. Although, according to him, like Tom Waits said, anywhere he lays his head, he&#039;ll call his home.<br /><br />As a writer, I find it romantic and just inspiring. I truly envy him. I sometimes think I could handle it as well.&nbsp; Then I start to remember that, even with my comfortable bed, I sometimes wake up not able to move due to the fact that, as the doctors put it, I have the back of a 70 year old. I also sometimes think that I just use that as an excuse because I&#039;m afraid of a big change like that.<br /><br /><br />Either way, it truly sounds wonderful.<br /><br />Of course, only if you want to be homeless or like that way of living...for anyone else it&#039;s probably pure hell.

				personally not , but i have a lot of friends that lives in caves/creecks near the sea , immerse in the nature and they live wonderfully .&nbsp; They live in small islands where wheater is always not less than 18-20 degrees , doing some small jobs sometimes and recycling food at night from trash in front of Supermarkets where every day the wastes of yet good fruit and vegetables are really high ,&nbsp; &nbsp;that kind of life it&#039;s another story in cold cities i think.

				The first time for me was because I got a ride out of town and couldn&#039;t get one back. Chick I was staying with for the weekend couldn&#039;t let me stay so I couch surfed til I felt I was wearing out my welcome...which was about 2 days per couch. With only a few bucks in my pocket and 2 sets of clothes in my backpack I started walking. All over. Met some cool folks. Got robbed in my sleep at a squat I found and my phone was stolen so I was really fucked. Spent a lot of time in various abandoned homes drinking and scoring drugs. It&#039;s happened a few times after that. Sometimes due to broken down vehicles. Sometimes out of frustration with the living situation I had at the time. I was always able to get by though. Traveling is always fun too. Even when you&#039;re broke. I&#039;ve never ridden the rails mainly because I prefer to rubber tramp it.

				I spent a good portion of 2012 homeless but never on the street. The hubby and I were living out of our van road tripping. Not the fun kind where you have money to do things, the broke kind where you&#039;re constantly afraid you&#039;re gonna run out of gas and you&#039;re picking cigs out of ashtrays. From Florida we made it all the way up to Pittsburg before coming back down and staying with his sister till we wore out our welcome. We lived in a really seedy hotel for a couple weeks and left covered in bed bug bites, but we finally did find a steady place for awhile where the landlord was really lenient about rent. Honestly we barely paid rent the whole nine months or so we were there. Lived without power for three of those (coldest) months, too...<br /><br />Yeah, it&#039;s a bummer being homeless. Even worse to be homeless and addicted.

				Vans are great. Thats like a home on wheels or a much more fuel efficient RV. There are a whole lot of people who call themselves van dwellers and stealth park any and everywhere. <br /><br />We call picking cigarettes out of ashtrays &quot;Snipe Hunting&quot; and I&#039;ve done a whole lot of that in my day. Even when I have a full pack I&#039;ll instinctively think about reaching down and picking up smokes that people took a couple puffs off and threw away. Habit I guess.

I don&#039;t know why, but at first I was kind of paranoid setting up camp in Wal-Mart parking lots and shit. It&#039;s just too bright there to be able to sleep well too. I had some fun times in rest stops, though. Those seem to be some of the best places to park for awhile. I miss our van.. it was this huge, obnoxiously bright cherry red Mystery Machine looking thing. Felt like driving a space ship. Hah.

				^ That&#039;s awesome. Library Parking lots are usually good too but they are bright. I made cut outs that fit snugly in the windows out of thin styrofoam board insulation and painted it black on both sides and it works so well that even at night in the dark with the interior lights on you can&#039;t see they are on. Well except for a small line around the edge of where I didn&#039;t cut it perfectly. Functions great. I&#039;ve seen people take screen and glue magnets to one side to keep bugs out and allow fresh air in. Google search Van dwelling or stealth camping. There is even a forum on Yahoo for van dwellers which is really neat. Some people go all out on their setup and many people start with a cargo van since they have fewer windows and look like commercial vehicles. That provides opportunities to park in any commercial lot without being hassled too much. <br /><br />I never really liked the term &quot;homeless&quot; for some reason. I always said that I was &quot;houseless&quot; Because I have a home no matter where I go. It&#039;s called earth. =P
