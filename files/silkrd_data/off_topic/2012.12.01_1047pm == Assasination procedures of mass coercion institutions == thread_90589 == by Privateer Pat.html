				Greetings, mates! <br /><br />It seems obvious to me that U.S.A. has illegal executions and that they can&#039;t kill people in.. &quot;public&quot;.. like Julian Assange.&nbsp; Facebook and other social media are in use of feds, but they also make citizens public, but what is public enough? Tell me what U.S.A.&nbsp; and other institutions need to know about the victim before go-ahead is given and what is enough to stop them? <br />Cheers!

				I don&#039;t think you can expect anyone to have reliable info on this one my friend!<br /><br />If you live in the third world, the US has proven they are prepared to kill you extra-judicially in public if they deem you deserve to die. The recent autonomous &#039;drone&#039; killing of some middle eastern &#039;supposed&#039; terrorist that was uncovered in the mainstream media who&#039;s name I cannot recall attests to that.<br /><br />If you believe the conspiracy theorists, they like to arrange for you to die in public from some mysterious food allergy.<br /><br />What factors are enough to have one become a target are I imagine wholly arbitrary given there is no judicial oversight and decided by a small group of self righteous, yet despicably evil American officials.<br /><br />I read that the president semi-recently gained the power to make &#039;executive orders&#039; that among other things, the wording would seem to allow for the assassination of private individuals worldwide. I don&#039;t vouch for the accuracy of that though.<br /><br />You ask &quot;what is enough to stop them&quot;, IMHO given sufficient perceived need, nothing would stop them.<br />History proves they are capable of the most diabolical acts.<br /><br />Look at &#039;Operation Northwoods&#039; on Wikipedia, the illegal and unsupported by the majority undeclared wars being fought presently that are even based on false pretenses and the unlawful warrantless wiretapping of all e-mail and phone calls that, although now public knowledge, the Govt blatantly persists with all while blocking legitimate, constitutionally protected court actions aimed at trying to bring them to account.<br /><br />The are far worse deeds than those though that I sure many others here are aware of.
