				I was just wondering, do you guys know of any specific drugs or drug combinations (that are &quot;safe&quot;) that would be perfect for a situation such as a job interview?<br /><br />Maybe a small dosage of MDMA or something like that? Or a combo of small dosages of various drugs.<br />(I&#039;ve not yet had anything other than weed and MDMA, so I don&#039;t really know first-hand what it most drugs are actually like or their side effects etc.)<br /><br />So where your nerves would be reduced, and confidence &amp; social skills increased, but allowing you to keep a level head and think straight, and without being blatantly obvious that you&#039;re under the influence of drugs.<br /><br />Has anybody here ever tried taking drugs going into a situation like that?

				propranolol<br /><br />it&#039;s on my page, beta blocker that really helps if you get red-faced or really nervous during interviews. musicians use it during concerts as well as pro shooters to lower their adrenaline response. careful with it though, in combination with other prescription meds u may be taking it could kill you (like a lotta stuff, but still....... I&#039;d look it up)

				I&#039;m not a physician, but it sounds like you could benefit from a low dose of an anxiolytic (benzodiazepines like bromazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam come to mind) and/or a stimulant (modafinil, methylphenidate, adderall, etc.)<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				For my two cents, I&#039;d recommend a low dose sativa edible. Something to perk you up and feel good, but not too much you lose your sharpness.

				There&#039;s a drug for passing polygraphs that is a semi-hypnotic and off of the the US market for over a decade, bit it&#039;s out there... id like to see that. Also, from the interviews I&#039;ve taken, propranolol (inderal) worked pretty good. if you have no benzo tolerance then maybe 1mg xanax and if no adderall tolerance Maybe 5-10mg IR... The adderal concerns me tho. if you block beta channels without also blocking calcium channels you could end up with paradoxical effects that lead to higher heart rate.<br /><br />I would do (and have done): 40 mg propranolol (take it a couple times before so you get used to it though) along with 1mg xanax (or 0.5 ativan)<br /><br />If you wanna stay sharp and confident adderall might be ok with xanax, but adderall causes anxiety, so if you&#039;re already anxious and you epinephrine (adrenaline) is pumping I don&#039;t see that helping.... could be wrong though........ google time?

				People with anxiety, (social anxiety OP) and people with psychiatric disorders in general often have co-morbid disorders. I would say that SWIM has ADD/ADHD with anxiety, so in my case it would likely be beneficial. <br /><br />Again, just general psychology.

Its patent has run out now, so you can get the generic for it, fluoxetine, which I believe is similar to the propranolol that someone else mentioned.&nbsp; I tried it for a month once, it did make me feel good, but I didn&#039;t like some of the side effects.<br />

				I know someone who, for a period of about five years, never attended an interview *WITHOUT* being on poppy tea. The odd thing was, more often than not he got the job. I&#039;m starting to think that it was because he was the most confident applicant... And he kept each job too, until they gave him a test. And it would be time for another interview.<br />in terms of being fairly unnoticeable, I suggest a light dose of Benzos,or maybe a bit of codeine. I&#039;ve always found passionfruit vine ( mostly tea from the leaves but the fruit is good too) takes the edge of things but then I have one growing out the back so I probably have more than my fair share of it. it&#039;s a nice chillout without being a blowout.<br />Scott

				Frankly I think it sounds like what you want are plain old beta blockers.&nbsp; All of these suggestions are kind of iffy, IMHO.&nbsp; Stimulants will wind you up, not calm you down (even if you have ADHD, if you aren&#039;t accustomed to them they&#039;ll make you more nervous, not less so).&nbsp; Adderall, ritalin, modafinil, etc. are out if you ask me.&nbsp; Don&#039;t get me wrong, I love stims, but they don&#039;t fit what you want.<br /><br />Any hypnotic or opiate is going to dull your wits.&nbsp; Xanax (alprazolam, right guys?) might work very nicely for you though, provided you take it in small doses.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to take more than you think you have, so don&#039;t just go chewing it like candy or something (at least I always ended up more fucked up than I meant to be...).<br /><br />Beta blockers though are really what I think you want, and this is why: they&#039;re basically not psychoactive at all in clinical doses, and prevent the sympathetic nervous system from kicking you into stress mode when you&#039;re anxious.&nbsp; I understand professional musicians (like the guys in symphonies, real professional musicians) use them outrageously often because they do nothing but prevent performance anxiety from hitting them.&nbsp; Apparently it&#039;s something about beta blockers that they describe as &quot;just stopping the anxiety of being in front of people.&quot;&nbsp; Sounds like that would work beautifully to not dull your mind, and let you just do what you do without anxiety making you befuddled.<br /><br />Just my .02 BTC.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never tried them personally, BTW, just second hand reporting.&nbsp; Now whether or not anybody&#039;s actually selling these not-fun beta blockers, that I can&#039;t say.

				I&#039;ve always found tramadol to be helpful for situations like the one you&#039;ve described.&nbsp; It&#039;s an opiod agonist and it also has the properties of SNRIs.&nbsp; I&#039;m a lot more calm and friendlier to people if I&#039;ve had between 50-150mg.&nbsp; Usually i like to stick to about 75mg though.<br /><br />They don&#039;t test for it on drug screenings either, so you&#039;d be good to go if it&#039;s for a job interview (assuming they&#039;d screen you for the job).&nbsp; Some of the other drugs mentioned could show up depending on how much time you have between the interview and screening.&nbsp; Just some food for thought.

Also can you take tramadol with this propinol substance?

				Thanks for the the responses everyone. I&#039;m relatively new to drugs altogether, and only really know the popular recreational ones, so finding out about aaaall the other stuff that&#039;s out there, it&#039;s really interesting actually. It&#039;s exciting to think how much things like this could improve my life over the years, and thanks to SR, I now have access.
