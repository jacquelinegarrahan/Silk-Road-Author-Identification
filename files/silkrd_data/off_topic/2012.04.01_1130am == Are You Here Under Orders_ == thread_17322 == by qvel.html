				The purpose of this thread is to track who came here and why.<br />We all know at this point that several Agents and Operators have been ordered to The Road for one reason or another.<br />That&#039;s not up for debate, it&#039;s a forgone conclusion. <br />So.. It&#039;s not really like anyone can see who voted on what.<br /><br />Let&#039;s see them numbers people.

Operators who have a physiological requirement for certain substances and have been ordered to those substances by an authorized military doctor.

I can imagine some of them saying &quot;this must be anthrax, but we are verifying&quot; at local television with the typical cup tone trying to say everything in a formal way, and after that a lab test (from the capital, my town does not have this technology) confirmed it was just md.<br /><br />But I just can&#039;t do a big troll like this and stay in silence. I would post and translate the news here and tell everybody in the city it was me.

				I edited the poll a bit, reset the votes. <br />Its clearer now, more serious, less humorous.<br /><br />But that was the directive, so.<br /><br />To answer a few questions:<br /><br />Why go to SR instead of &#039;Government Sources&#039;<br />&quot;Government Sources&quot; have long been fraught with trouble.<br />Double crossing, dirty dealing, lack of tracking. Bad meet-ups. Firefights. Ambushes.<br /><br />The reason to prefer the SR is obvious and multifold:<br /><br />#1 Escrow: the money is held in Escrow until Precious Cargo is received.<br />#2 No F2F: And no resulting ambushes, firefights, SNAFU, FUBAR, etc.<br />#3 Greenlisted Vendors: Verified quality, Verified procedures. <br />#4 Worldwide Availability: Accessible Anywhere through the Naval TOR system. <br />#5 TOR is Home Ground. Navy controls it, and relies on it for countless Ops.<br /><br />There&#039;s more to it than that, but these are really the Big Five for the BBBs (Big Brass Ballers).<br />
