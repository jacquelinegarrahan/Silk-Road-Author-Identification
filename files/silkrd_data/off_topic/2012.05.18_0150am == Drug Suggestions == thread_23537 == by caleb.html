				Okay, so I&#039;ve been on three different anti-depressants since December. They&#039;ve done nothing&nbsp; :(&nbsp; <br />I know that weed&#039;s on the list of &quot;Illegal drugs that should help&quot;, supposedly shrooms help, same with LSD and MDMA.

				Mix 100mg of heroin with 200mg floride take 2 times a day before meals.<br />Kidding....<br />But mdma wont help a lot it make actually make your situation work once you come down I wouldnt risk it kinda a gamble.<br /><br />No one really feels sad after doing lsd or shrooms they for sure would boost your mood long term. I would say shrooms are better than lsd for what you need.

				I&#039;ve heard nothing but good things about ketamine in terms of curing depression. MDMA won&#039;t really help because it&#039;s a temporary fix to depression. Weed actually makes it worse for me but everyone is different so try it out. Shrooms will definitely make you happier, there&#039;s actually scientific proof of this but I would suggest taking it with good friends. Buy some l-tryptophan on amazon or somewhere online, it helps stabilize your mood and take multivitamins as well. You can also never go wrong with exercising and just going on walks or getting out of the house.

They chemically imbalance the fuck out of your brain. Not only will you grow a dependency on something that doesn&#039;t really cure your depression, you&#039;ll have newer problems you didn&#039;t have before :(<br /><br />To stay on topic: LSD sounds about right. Weed should do a number to offset the damage the anti-depressants have been doing, probably not close to enough though.

				Look up MXE, there are a few threads around here about how it helps with depression.

				Well, sorry to disappoint you, but I doubt a substitute drug for anti depressants will help you to actually cure your depression. A lot of anti depressants don&#039;t work for a lot of people, so you&#039;ll just have to try a lot out till you found one that might work for you. Also, the most important point is a therapy. If you&#039;re not on one already, start one, as it might help you to cure &amp; find out the reasons for it, while drugs often only temporary let you forget the pain... Better keep your hands of psychedelics like LSD &amp; shrooms if you&#039;re suffering a mental illness anyhow, seriously. Of course it has the potential to help you, but chances are bigger it will just leave you completely confused and even more fucked up. What might help you though is a Sativa strain cannabis.

It helps people learn how to deal with any problem at hand instead of using another substance as a cop-out. You think everyone doesn&#039;t go through depression? Of course they do. Do they all take medication for it? Fuck no. Now, if you can accept that you can&#039;t function without a cop-out or are too weak-willing to, then admit and realize your current position. After having realized the position you&#039;re in and all of the things you want to think through--THAT&#039;S when you should drop, say about, two tabs of acid. THIS is the magic in acid. THIS is what it does. Simply taking acid doesn&#039;t cure depression. Having a great insightful trip DOES!

				See a psychologist, I&#039;m about to, and I&#039;ve had friends that have done this and it cured their depression. Also maybe try Remeron (mirtazipine), it&#039;s a different type of anti-depressant and doesn&#039;t interact with any drugs like most anti-depressants so you can still try MXE, MDMA, weed etc with no adverse side effects. Also valium works well for me but I have severe anxiety as well.

				Just remember that you need to stop taking the anti-depressants before you take anything from here, the interactions could kill you
