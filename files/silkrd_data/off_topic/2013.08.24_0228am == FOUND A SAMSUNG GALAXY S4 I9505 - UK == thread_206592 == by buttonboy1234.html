				Hey guys.<br /><br />I found a samsung galaxy s4 I9505. No I genuinely didn&#039;t steal it, I found it.<br /><br />The phone was pattern-locked so I couldn&#039;t get access into it to find any information to enable me to contact the owner. Anyway, after thinking about it (this phone) worth around £500 is definitely insured and although it&#039;s inconvenient for the owner, it&#039;s certainly not the end of the world. The insurance will have to cough up for a new phone and the insurance the owner has been paying will have been worth it.<br /><br />So, I&#039;ve factory reset the phone and now have access. However - I&#039;m a complete novice when it comes to mobile phones - I&#039;ve put a SIM inside it but it won&#039;t allow me to ring off of it. Therefore does this mean it has been blocked? If so, does that mean it cannot be used?<br /><br />I was hoping to sell this phone but don&#039;t know the risks involved. Firstly, can this phone ever be traced? The IMEI number? Is it usable? What&#039;s the easiest way for me to make some money on it and not get traced.<br /><br />Hopefully someone on here could help.<br /><br />Thanks. ;)

				Firstly the coppers could have returned it but I wouldnt be doing that now you have wiped it <br />Second if they have reported it stolen for insurance its as much use as a pretty paper weight to you <br />Third buy a burnable simcard use it to sell it then throw sim away I do it with things I dont want the hassel of dealing with later

				Its useless to you as in it cant call sell it via gum tree or ebay etc using a $2 sim card that is not registered in your name and you throw away after sale and dont let them come to your house either mail it to them or meet somewhere and have a low batt so itll turn on but not long enough to check its locked

				The UK has a centralised database of lost / stolen phones, which is keyed on the IMEI.&nbsp; If the owner of the phone has reported it as lost / stolen to their service provider, the phone isn&#039;t going to work with any Sim card. <br /><br />

				just sell it to someone on the other side of the world. i think it&#039;ll only be blocked in the uk. you could utilise alternative global communications systems(internet) to initiate contact.

				Wow you&#039;re a piece of shit. What if that phone had something important on it? Pictures of a dead relative? Sensitive work information for their job?<br /><br />http://revision3.com/hak5/using-rubber-ducky-tohack-androids<br /><br />You could have at least brute forced the passcode. EVEYONE knows lost/stolen phones are fucking paperweights or an android version of an ipod touch.

				might as well chunk it in the river..<br />it definitely has GPS on it..<br />and if it were to belong to a younger generation..<br />or hell, most people..<br />it probably has &quot;Find my Phone&quot; activated, along with GPS.<br />if it is blocked it is listed as stolen.<br />you can sell it to someone you DON&#039;T KNOW..<br />so if they get caught they can&#039;t find you..<br />pawn shops and shit though will give you up quick as fuck.<br /><br />be safe and scrap it for parts and build a vape pen or something..<br />or modify an e cig..<br /><br />be safe.<br />cheers.<br /><br />/thumbs
