				Always thinking about their own selfish needs, not seeing that drug use causes so many problems in society. Think of all of the innocent people who have been victimized by drugs, their otherwise hopeful lives turned into a cycle of madness, always after the next fix. Drugs turn people into shallow shells of beings, destroy families, lead to violence and cause damage all around them. You think that your hedonistic coke and heroin habit is a victimless crime, there are thousands of people being killed every day just so you can get your jollies off slowly poisoning yourselves , your communities and everyone around you. I think drug users should be marked for death honestly, once you cross that line there is no coming back from it. I think society as a whole has rightfully condemned such abhorrent practices in the name of protecting families and children, there is simply no place for drugs in a civilized world.

I think you are just being so sharp towards me because you are a junkie trying to shift the focus onto me to avoid facing the facts that you get your jollies off sniffing drugs that fund cocaine cartels that decapitate hundreds of people. Get off the dope bro it kills you and everyone around you. I can&#039;t even imagine what would lead someone to want to pay to poison themselves to support narcoterrorists massacring everyone, you clearly have a very bad disease and are better just put out of your misery before you spread it.
