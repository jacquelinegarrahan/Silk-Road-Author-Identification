				I have known my women a few years. I was lucky to find her as I was a bit of a mess - liable to go home with ANY women. I was getting &#039;bored&#039;/ You may laugh but hit your late thirties and you might find a one night stand becomes routine. It got so bad I was feeling down again soon after. Even worse was striking up a conversation and knowing you have nothing in common.<br /><br />Men need emotional attachment when we get older. Just going out - getting laid off a random stranger wanes off after a while. I would leave early and by the time I walked home I felt as bad as I felt before getting laid. When your a teenager you walk tall like a king after getting laid!<br /><br />So - I met this women a while back. She works away so we meet at weekends and long weekends and any chance she can get off work. My work is mostly working occasional VERY long shifts. I also care for family. <br /><br />So to cut a long story short I have been getting on great with this women. We share a lot of interests but have enough interests of our own. she loves soaps on TV but will let me watch the football.<br /><br />In the past women hve had issues with my drug hobby. I am always open about this because lets face it - if you enjoy drugs recreational then hiding it from your woman is a moody thing. <br /><br />A good litmus test to see if you love a women is to have a few of your fav drugs on the table - and to ask yourself if you&#039;d sooner spend time in her company free of those drugs! Drugs like coke, E, speed - in the past I would ALWAYS take them and if the women had some issue about it I would apologize and wish her luck in getting more suitable man.<br /><br />But with this women - I can put the drugs to one side!<br /><br />One exception is that my women has a sis who married some Mexican guy. She was going to the USA before I met her and always ends up having some of the Mex coke that they get over there. I laughed at her description of a coke that kept you high for hours but when I did visit I swear that the average UK pub sized line (100mg) made me feel fantastic for hours! <br /><br />I am lucky as my women only uses coke three times a year! <br /><br />A vendor here, one who must be a&nbsp; bit of a soft romantic - ha offered to send me a free gram of real quality cocaine as I bought off three vendors here - got my BTC stolen by some Canadian guy and ended up with&nbsp; sale price UK style coke that turned out to be &#039;classic&#039; UK style coke. Makes you feel insecure! Paranoia and impotence. <br /><br />Anyhow the anniversey of when we met - I remember the day, time and exact location. She does not! But we meet there every year - then I take her home and prepared a really nice meal before taking her to the pub. She ended up missing the last train home! <br /><br />I asked if he would mind if I rolled a joint. From 1.30am till almost 6.00am we talked!<br /><br />The second anniversary we went to the USA to meet the sister and her Mexican guy. He was great - ran his own construction business but came from a real rough area. He took me to visit hi &#039;homies&#039; and the huys were tattooed, most looked like they were no strangers to gyms but they had a habit of holding house parties.&nbsp; At one of these parties my women and her sister turn up and ask the guys for some coke. A dozen hands reach into pockets. Many had blocks of the stuff! <br /><br />Ever since tasting that quality of cocaine everything in the UK has seemed like a total waste of money. I swear some of the coke here is 10% or less because 90% of coke dealers are going to get creative and add a few additives to bulk up the gear.<br /><br />In the UK - lets say some firm get 30 kilos through somehow. (through some small business) Even if the producers of the yayo are from Columbia - the guys there have stuff they can add to the mix. Even adding 10% they would get away with it. Globalisations and new technology means that the people making the coke can see what prices we pay in the West. they can also see that 30% coke is acceptable to many in the UK. <br /><br />Trouble is most UK gangs or even individuals who get hold of the &#039;pure&#039; kilo are going to make two if not three kilos out of that. Different people use different processes. Some will order &#039;caines&#039; online so mixing those in with the cocaine its bloody hard to detect. Worse still are the people using RCs to give weak batches of coke some kind of definite reaction. Speed is a silly thing to add to coke. Anyone who buys coke which has speed in it will know about it.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m going off tangent here. Truth be told I am excited. I am not on any substance apart from Afghan Gold Seal hash - but I guess a few men out there have been through the nerve wracking time in which you know you got the right women. I&#039;m sure she will say yes - but part of me says &#039;she will tell you to fuck off&#039;<br /><br />A few weeks back, I went to a day party - got wasted - but when I got back home a few were going out to the pub. I told my women I would take some MDMA and measured out 100mg of the Ivory MDMA crystal. I was so loved up I almost asked her there and then but thought it best to do it sober - then have some drugs lined up to celebrate. <br /><br />Her being a coke user only I am hoping I get some good coke in time and am looking for 100mg testers and no way am I risking throwing away good money on a drug I personally would never use if it were not for my women! I am so glad she uses 3 times a year because I have had dealings with real coke-head party girls. They are fun when its the party - but the next day after when you fancy just lazing on the sofa smoking some good weed or hash - they want MORE coke! A lot of girls play guys - girls enjoy coke - but can easily sucker some guy into it. In all truth if your a women who uses coke every weekend and the off night. If you rely on it for confidence- time to take&nbsp; break!<br /><br />Anyhow - I wish I could invite some of you people to the party if all goes well! I am great with words and get paid for writing but I feel like some nervous 7 yr old playing the good shepherd at the school nativity play - like I am going to stumble my lines!<br /><br />I got to do this &#039;sober&#039; which in the UK just means you been smoking some bud or hash. If I took MDMA - lol - its good if she says yes - but would not like to be told &#039;no&#039; on MDMA.<br /><br />Coke - that will her treat afterwards or so I hope! I&#039;m hoping for some real special stuff - and if the vendor here sends me the anniversary gift - I will thank him so much! <br /><br />My women likes chocolates - so get some of them. Flowers she does not like but live plants sure.<br /><br />The setting for asking her is the place we originally met. I was high on some fantastic indica hash. I unwisely decided to drink five bottles of Budweiser, a drink that I hate with a vengeance! I invited her back for some coffee - talked all night. The next day I introduced her to all my family. I took her to my second home. OK - its the local pub, but really nice.<br /><br />I would like a few women to advise me. I&#039;m old fashioned but have a stash box that shows that I am &#039;with it&#039; also! I envision getting down on that bended knee. but as for buying rings I am clueless. I can measure her finger when she is asleep I guess. <br /><br />I&#039;m losing sleep over this but its good because I feel good and I know in my heart she is right for me. <br /><br />I guess part of me is scared also. We stay with each other a lot but not lived together. Due to work commitments we might be not able to move in with each other for a year or more. <br /><br />I&#039;m an older guy who was NEVER the settling down type. I never wanted to be married and loved having my own time and my own life. As for drugs I enjoyed many of them but we all need a little love in our lives. Sometimes it takes a while before you meet the right someone. Sometimes you do a lot of drugs searching for some happiness - even if its fleeting. I done all that and the happiness off most drugs is fleeting.<br /><br />The best drug is love! Love is like a drug - and even that basic love of friends its a feel good thing that comes back to you.<br /><br />So, I wish good luck to everyone who is searching for some love. Don&#039;t be despondent about it. We got a summer coming - festivals, chances to meet some people who may connect with you. <br /><br />But have love for people regardless. Of course not everyone here is going to agree to this. Some here are not so nice people - but I wish those people good luck because in this life it is the people who love and care for others who will be rewarded with friendship and companionship and comradeship.<br /><br />We do not know each other here but we are all people - struggling in some areas of life and ahead of the game in others. Most of us here treat each other with civility. The minority of scammers here is lower than that in the real life drug scene.<br /><br />And because we choose to use some drugs we are treated like criminals. It truly is a bizarree world when sniffing some yayo up your&nbsp; nose is seen as &#039;evil&#039; whilst getting some remote controlled drone to blow apart some &#039;guy&#039; who might be a &#039;bad guy&#039; is just normal - actually seen as &#039;good&#039;.<br /><br />In this life - you got to create a space in which you block out the world and forget - just for a while - the insanity of the people who rule over us,<br /><br />It is a crazy world!! <br /><br />Final point - I guess friendship and love and comradeship is all that matters.<br /><br />Even though er are all anon here - I think that if we hired a club - and had 300 regular contributors turning up - then nobody would turn up as we would all think it was a set up! like the cops sending our &#039;prize notification&#039; letters out to bail jumpers who turn up to some place tp find there is no free TV just a free pair of handcuffs and a lot of cops laughing because - lets face it - anyone stupid enough to fall for it would make you laugh cop or not.<br /><br />Seriously though I am sure many of us here would become friends! Its a shame this will never happen unless we wear an SR tshirt at festivals and hope that we bump into UK Pharm so I can hug those guys and thank them for th Afghan hash I have been smoking. Love to meet Ivory also! And on these boards I notice a few intelligent people who I guess would make great company!<br /><br />So any advice for me.<br /><br />And wish me all the luck also guys! Prayers also! I take Jewish prayers, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and obviously Christianity! <br /><br />And if you EVER see anyone who you really like - just ask them out!!! Took me a while to get the courage up but use humor. Don&#039;t try and act cool if your not feeling that way!<br /><br />Wish I could invite you all to my party. Boy it will be some mad event. Half my relatives are younger - they will be on E after 10.00pm when things will get serious.<br /><br />My anniversary is 22 May!!<br /><br />My head is all over the place - butterflies in the stomach and I guess anyone who has been through this knows its good and bad! Will she say yes? That is the question that runs around my mind. <br /><br />So wish me luck. Unusual topic maybe but love is a drug so I include it!<br /><br /><br /><br />

				The conspirator inside me tells me you&#039;re trying to lure us to an LE trap. I don&#039;t have any real advice but it sounds like you&#039;ll be happy. You should ask her. <br /><br />If I were you I would encourage her to try more drugs than coke because it sounds like you enjoy a diversity of drugs. When you&#039;re together you should always be on the same drugs at the same time.

				I don&#039;t actually think you&#039;re LE, your plan would never work. <br /><br />I&#039;m no expert on women, but I reckon you were on the right track asking her sober and doing drugs to celebrate afterwards. Maybe you should take her somewhere really awesome when you ask her, like the summit of a mountain. <br /><br />Or have your friends wear masks and kidnap her, like stuff her in the trunk of a car and have them try and ransom her to you. Then you show up and pretend to kill them and save her. Like Liam Neeson in Taken.

				&quot;love is a drug&quot;<br />....<br /><br />the worst one of them all - gets you higher than the cleanest coke, heroin or crystal without any ado... and keeps you there for hours, days, weeks, months or years even...<br /><br />but when it&#039;s suddenly gone, the pain is so deep and unending it takes out all your will to live. the withdrawal.... is more unbearable than any torture one could ever devise. and the worst part of it all?..<br /><br />you can&#039;t find a replacement. nothing else fills that void. nothing takes away the hurt. nothing soothes the searing pain and the torturous heartbreak.<br /><br />sigh.<br /><br />/pussifaction.<br /><br />in unrelated news, if you got it - godspeed, may the winds of bullshit beat at your back and never catch up.<br /><br />if you have never had the chance to experience it - don&#039;t be lured in. the addiction is overrated and the withdrawal pain is unabated.

				My method was simple and like you we had been together for some time- I think it was 6 years. We woke up one morning before we had kids, etc and sport fucked. It just went the fuck down. Afterwards I looked at her and said &quot;hey, let&#039;s run up to the jewelry store and go pick our a ring. i&#039;m ready to make this thing legit&quot;.... And that was it. She was thrilled as fuck too. That down on one knee shit is too outdated for me and she is a different type of woman that&#039;s not with all the romantic type girly stuff.

From 1.30am till almost 6.00am we talked!<br /><br />The second anniversary we went to the USA to meet the sister and her Mexican guy. He was great - ran his own construction business but came from a real rough area. He took me to visit hi &#039;homies&#039; and the huys were tattooed, most looked like they were no strangers to gyms but they had a habit of holding house parties.&nbsp; At one of these parties my women and her sister turn up and ask the guys for some coke. A dozen hands reach into pockets. Many had blocks of the stuff! <br /><br />Ever since tasting that quality of cocaine everything in the UK has seemed like a total waste of money. I swear some of the coke here is 10% or less because 90% of coke dealers are going to get creative and add a few additives to bulk up the gear.<br /><br />In the UK - lets say some firm get 30 kilos through somehow. (through some small business) Even if the producers of the yayo are from Columbia - the guys there have stuff they can add to the mix. Even adding 10% they would get away with it. Globalisations and new technology means that the people making the coke can see what prices we pay in the West. they can also see that 30% coke is acceptable to many in the UK. <br /><br />Trouble is most UK gangs or even individuals who get hold of the &#039;pure&#039; kilo are going to make two if not three kilos out of that. Different people use different processes. Some will order &#039;caines&#039; online so mixing those in with the cocaine its bloody hard to detect. Worse still are the people using RCs to give weak batches of coke some kind of definite reaction. Speed is a silly thing to add to coke. Anyone who buys coke which has speed in it will know about it.<br /><br />Anyhow, I&#039;m going off tangent here. Truth be told I am excited. I am not on any substance apart from Afghan Gold Seal hash - but I guess a few men out there have been through the nerve wracking time in which you know you got the right women. I&#039;m sure she will say yes - but part of me says &#039;she will tell you to fuck off&#039;<br /><br />A few weeks back, I went to a day party - got wasted - but when I got back home a few were going out to the pub. I told my women I would take some MDMA and measured out 100mg of the Ivory MDMA crystal. I was so loved up I almost asked her there and then but thought it best to do it sober - then have some drugs lined up to celebrate. <br /><br />Her being a coke user only I am hoping I get some good coke in time and am looking for 100mg testers and no way am I risking throwing away good money on a drug I personally would never use if it were not for my women! I am so glad she uses 3 times a year because I have had dealings with real coke-head party girls. They are fun when its the party - but the next day after when you fancy just lazing on the sofa smoking some good weed or hash - they want MORE coke! A lot of girls play guys - girls enjoy coke - but can easily sucker some guy into it. In all truth if your a women who uses coke every weekend and the off night. If you rely on it for confidence- time to take&nbsp; break!<br /><br />Anyhow - I wish I could invite some of you people to the party if all goes well! I am great with words and get paid for writing but I feel like some nervous 7 yr old playing the good shepherd at the school nativity play - like I am going to stumble my lines!<br /><br />I got to do this &#039;sober&#039; which in the UK just means you been smoking some bud or hash. If I took MDMA - lol - its good if she says yes - but would not like to be told &#039;no&#039; on MDMA.<br /><br />Coke - that will her treat afterwards or so I hope! I&#039;m hoping for some real special stuff - and if the vendor here sends me the anniversary gift - I will thank him so much! <br /><br />My women likes chocolates - so get some of them. Flowers she does not like but live plants sure.<br /><br />The setting for asking her is the place we originally met. I was high on some fantastic indica hash. I unwisely decided to drink five bottles of Budweiser, a drink that I hate with a vengeance! I invited her back for some coffee - talked all night. The next day I introduced her to all my family. I took her to my second home. OK - its the local pub, but really nice.<br /><br />I would like a few women to advise me. I&#039;m old fashioned but have a stash box that shows that I am &#039;with it&#039; also! I envision getting down on that bended knee. but as for buying rings I am clueless. I can measure her finger when she is asleep I guess. <br /><br />I&#039;m losing sleep over this but its good because I feel good and I know in my heart she is right for me. <br /><br />I guess part of me is scared also. We stay with each other a lot but not lived together. Due to work commitments we might be not able to move in with each other for a year or more. <br /><br />I&#039;m an older guy who was NEVER the settling down type. I never wanted to be married and loved having my own time and my own life. As for drugs I enjoyed many of them but we all need a little love in our lives. Sometimes it takes a while before you meet the right someone. Sometimes you do a lot of drugs searching for some happiness - even if its fleeting. I done all that and the happiness off most drugs is fleeting.<br /><br />The best drug is love! Love is like a drug - and even that basic love of friends its a feel good thing that comes back to you.<br /><br />So, I wish good luck to everyone who is searching for some love. Don&#039;t be despondent about it. We got a summer coming - festivals, chances to meet some people who may connect with you. <br /><br />But have love for people regardless. Of course not everyone here is going to agree to this. Some here are not so nice people - but I wish those people good luck because in this life it is the people who love and care for others who will be rewarded with friendship and companionship and comradeship.<br /><br />We do not know each other here but we are all people - struggling in some areas of life and ahead of the game in others. Most of us here treat each other with civility. The minority of scammers here is lower than that in the real life drug scene.<br /><br />And because we choose to use some drugs we are treated like criminals. It truly is a bizarree world when sniffing some yayo up your&nbsp; nose is seen as &#039;evil&#039; whilst getting some remote controlled drone to blow apart some &#039;guy&#039; who might be a &#039;bad guy&#039; is just normal - actually seen as &#039;good&#039;.<br /><br />In this life - you got to create a space in which you block out the world and forget - just for a while - the insanity of the people who rule over us,<br /><br />It is a crazy world!! <br /><br />Final point - I guess friendship and love and comradeship is all that matters.<br /><br />Even though er are all anon here - I think that if we hired a club - and had 300 regular contributors turning up - then nobody would turn up as we would all think it was a set up! like the cops sending our &#039;prize notification&#039; letters out to bail jumpers who turn up to some place tp find there is no free TV just a free pair of handcuffs and a lot of cops laughing because - lets face it - anyone stupid enough to fall for it would make you laugh cop or not.<br /><br />Seriously though I am sure many of us here would become friends! Its a shame this will never happen unless we wear an SR tshirt at festivals and hope that we bump into UK Pharm so I can hug those guys and thank them for th Afghan hash I have been smoking. Love to meet Ivory also! And on these boards I notice a few intelligent people who I guess would make great company!<br /><br />So any advice for me.<br /><br />And wish me all the luck also guys! Prayers also! I take Jewish prayers, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and obviously Christianity! <br /><br />And if you EVER see anyone who you really like - just ask them out!!! Took me a while to get the courage up but use humor. Don&#039;t try and act cool if your not feeling that way!<br /><br />Wish I could invite you all to my party. Boy it will be some mad event. Half my relatives are younger - they will be on E after 10.00pm when things will get serious.<br /><br />My anniversary is 22 May!!<br /><br />My head is all over the place - butterflies in the stomach and I guess anyone who has been through this knows its good and bad! Will she say yes? That is the question that runs around my mind. <br /><br />So wish me luck. Unusual topic maybe but love is a drug so I include it!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh man, not trying to be mean or anything but what difference does a piece of paper make really? In reality, it gives her a bit of control over your life. If anything happened to you, she would get your shit before it went to your kids. It&#039;s better to just shack up and keep your freedoms dude. I mean, why fix it if it aint broken? Isn&#039;t things going pretty good right now? <br /><br />I&#039;m sorry man, don&#039;t let me stand in the way of your happiness brother. If this is what it takes for you to find happiness then by all means, tie that knot!

				First, I can&#039;t warn you enough - Run. If we hadn&#039;t of had a child, I would be 1 Expedia transaction away from moving far, far away.<br /><br />But if you really want to commit suicide/propose I wouldn&#039;t involve drugs or anything kinky in it, it&#039;s something you guys will want to tell family and partial strangers for 3 months to several years, depending on how long you can stand each other afterwards.<br /><br />Putting the ring in food has too many variables, I&#039;d pick some restaurant that has meaning to you both and for dessert have the waiter/waitress bring out a tray, open it and have the ring sitting there with the dessert and some flower that has meaning to her. Then you get the right, get down on one knee, pull the trigger and kiss your life and sanity goodbye.

				The greatest proposal I&#039;ve ever heard of involved the man sticking her ring in dog poo, followed by him asking her nonchalantly if she could pick up the dog doodoo in the back. So she reluctantly gives in and walks outside to pick up the shit only to find....a marvelous ring embedded in the excrement of their beloved dog. 8)
