				I read a forum about bit coins and how they can be farmed on a large scale but due to the difficulty you need lots of people working together to decrypt bit coins and the amount is shared among everyone. It&#039;s called &quot;Pool Mining&quot; Has anyone heard of this and can verify the truth behind this? If this works any tips on how to do it?

That said, mining pools do exist.&nbsp; However, the work factor has now become so large for bitcoin mining that it is literally out of reach of the individual computer user.&nbsp; In order to mine coins effectively, you require expensive hardware like an FPGA mining rig.&nbsp; Bitcoin mining by individuals was possible in the very early days, but this is no longer the case, at least with the stock computer hardware that most people have. <br /><br />Guru<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I have not done much reading about mining as of yet besides for some stuff about how its costs an arm and a leg and I should not even waist my time looking into it... Silly me..<br /><br />For real tho, Lets say you had some cash to invest... <br /><br />assume for a minute that I have a location to have all the computers running<br /><br />I can hire people if needed and already have 25 regular computers on site..<br /><br />how much would it need to start mining coins 10k 50k 100k??<br /><br />&nbsp;:o

				25 regular computers get you about .04-.05 btc everyday. Without rigs, you wouldn&#039;t even be breaking even from the electricity costs

				So It&#039;s definitely possible with the right equipment right? What is this &quot;Rig setup&quot; Is that like a specific type of hardware modification you need to do? Even making .1 BTC a day is great for me because I am living in a college dorm and electricity is free. Depending on costs I can get a computer with the right specs to mining I just can&#039;t do it big since I would only be using one computer.
