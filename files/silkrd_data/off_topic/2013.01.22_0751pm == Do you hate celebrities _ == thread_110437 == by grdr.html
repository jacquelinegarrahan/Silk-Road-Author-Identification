				Question is pretty simple. I don&#039;t know why but I get so annoyed when I see american celebrities treated with so much respect and crazy fans worshiping them like gods. Why does some people freak out so much when they meet them ? I for example would never ask autograph from anyone why would I need it ? Are americans brainwashed from young age that they&#039;re country is the best place there is and that everyones ultimate goal is to be famous?

				Hate is a pretty strong word.<br /><br />I would assume getting someones autograph is just another form of collecting. Some people collect stamps, coins, etc. Having something personal from someone who has probably accomplished a lot more than most in their life. <br /><br />Not that i do it, i just can see why some people might get excited about meeting a celebrity<br />

				I don&#039;t hate anyone to be honest. Regarding celebrities, I don&#039;t like them and they have no bearing on my life. It gets on my nerves when people massage their egos though. Bono is my least favourite celebrity because of his ego and how much shite he talks. Many people feel the same here in Ireland&nbsp; ???

				I have more respect for certain people in this world. How well known they are has nothing to do with it. Actually, I might have a slight bias against them if they are a celebrity. More so for the pop culture/ do nothing kind. However, I&#039;m into certain music so If I like an artist, does that mean I like a celebrity? All the musical artists I like probably wouldn&#039;t classify as actual celebrities but I think I&#039;ve made my point...kinda.

				It depends on the celebrity. Some famous people are good regular people, easy going, humble and nice. They just happen to be famous\rich.<br /><br />Some are dicks, full of themselves, think they are better than everyone else because they are rich\famous.

				@ Grdr - Have you been watching those prats Spencer and Heidi on Celebrity Big Brother? They did a big speech about how America is the best country ever. Is this what prompted your post or is it just a coincidence?
