Sometimes that&#039;s cool but, I much prefer the flavor of the cannabis.<br /><br />Has anyone ever tried those Puffy Drops you add to a joint for flavor? I&#039;ll admit, its a cool novelty.

If your into flavours you can get Mango a lovely Indica strain that lives up to it&#039;s namesake, and if you love Mangoes it&#039;s the one, or Cherry Pie, tried that for the first time recently, had the most amazing cherry flavour! I&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty more flavourful bud out there, but I am just going by my experience.<br /><br />With all that flavourful bud out there there&#039;s no need for flavoured skins!&nbsp; ;)

				I like RAW papers, even though it&#039;s quite an acquired roll: The first few times I rolled with raws, the end of my joint would have to be torched off before it would burn evenly. They&#039;re slippery papers but rewarding, raws burn slower than regular bleached papers and add a nice taste to a spliff.<br />As far as blunts go give me a dutchmaster or a backwood. I don&#039;t understand strongly flavored wraps when you can get weed of different flavors.
