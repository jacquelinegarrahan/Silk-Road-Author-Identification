				Welp, i went to a show last night and took a chicago mint (mdma), i felt good but no magic really. now i did drink a beer or two and a couple glasses of wine. i dont know if there are any cross tolerances between the two... all in all i guess i really dont care. but im curious to others that lost the magic, does it ever come back after not touching the stuff for a long while? taking 2 100mg 5-htp a day for a month? i should mention that ive been rolling about once every 1-2 weeks for a couple months. stupid i know.....

				You should definitely slow down on the rolling. In my younger highschool days, I took ecstasy at a similarly frequent rate and surely enough lost the magic in no time at all. But after years of abstinence, the magic has come back for the most part.<br /><br />Ecstasy just really can not be abused if you hope to maintain the effects. The magic is lost quite quickly if you use it too frequently. Definitely spend some more time in between each use. It makes the times you do take it exponentially better and gives you a little bit more to look forward to.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started loosing it for a while, I remember a roll where I took 0.1 and smoked one nug and I was laying on the grass in love. I snuck .2 of some 8$/capsule pure on the plane to Hawaii recently and took one on the beach on one on a volcano and I definitely wish I had the same magic as the hippy roll on the grassy knoll I just mentioned. Then again the weather there is so warm it&#039;s almost like a light roll anyways.&nbsp; Although I noticed that the magic is going away the body load is still there, especially when I was in the water, it got too cold at some points. However I found that after I stopped railing it, limited myself to when my instincts and emotions tell me it&#039;s the right time to roll, and buying good 9-15$ a .1 molly pure quality It can still take my there!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few more tips on getting the magic the build serotonin with a healthy diet and take 5-htp supplements. Treat MDMA as it&#039;s name goes &quot;Molly&quot; like it&#039;s another human being who gets worn out when you become to needy of her and finally remember to try to leave the addict perspective, drugs react with your emotions and state of mind so try to forget the feelings like you&#039;ve never done it before, bring the imagination and whimsical curiosity that comes natural to us as human beings. Oh, and take it with other people you love! I also heard eating chocolate helps, but they say that chocolate helps ALOT of things.

				Lost the magic years ago. Went without any for 2 years and even going back it was gone. <br /><br />I don&#039;t bother anymore to be honest, chasing the good times is dangerous so I&#039;ll just look back and grin at how good it was and how lucky I am to have experienced it.

				Losing the magic of mdma sounds like my worst nightmare. I only do it once a month or less and never over.2 at a time. It&#039;s probably my favorite drug of all. This world is cruel to give you a taste and then snatch it away for good.

				I don&#039;t get it what is this magic that you guys are losing?&nbsp; Is it the sense of well being with the world?&nbsp; That&#039;s what I look for in my rolls and its always there, it&#039;s one of the main effects.&nbsp; I roll 150-200mg once every 2 months for 4 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;What&#039;s a magicless roll like?&nbsp; I&#039;m curious :P

You&#039;re up, you feel good (but not amazing), and then you&#039;re down. No extreme loved-up feelings, no significant euphoria, just mediocre effects followed by an often nasty comedown.

				I loved e a little too much. The first roll was the only truly incredible one, even though I had way better quality stuff the following times. Ended up way overdoing that shit trying to get the old feeling back, even taking 600mg in one sitting at a point. Vomited it up, got real depressed and had nightmares for weeks. Luckily I discovered mushrooms and no longer give much of a crap about e anymore. My advice would be to try other (preferably &quot;soft&quot; shit, though I&#039;m not your mother) and just be glad you got to experience it.

				I noticed that recently- like the first few times i just wanted to talk to everyone and felt like super hero status.&nbsp; Now its still awesome but i just feel like a little giddy and like a kid and awake- im not like going crazy its much more mellow- its nice, but i miss that intense crazy shit that made me profess love and vibe out with the stupidest smile on my face while i scrambled around with cashmere scarfs- those were the fucking days

				I had a book back in the early 90&#039;s that said it took 30 days to replace the serotonin after mdma use.&nbsp; I am sure if you search around the net you can find similar info.&nbsp; So rolling every weekend or even every other weekend you will lose that magic since you don&#039;t have as much serotonin to release.&nbsp; I think most of us have not abided by this rule at some point in our lives but if you really want to get the most out of it that one of many things we should abide by.<br /><br />Another thing is those mints have been around for a while now and I am sure they have been replicated and you may not be getting the same thing you were at the beginning, US pills really suck!
