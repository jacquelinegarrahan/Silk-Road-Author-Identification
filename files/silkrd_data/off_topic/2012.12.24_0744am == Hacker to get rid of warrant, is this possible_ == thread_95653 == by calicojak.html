				Or let&#039;s say reinstate a drivers license that has been suspended. Just thoughts. Would these things be possible?

				I was always told that if you get a suspended license that the best thing to do is go to your local DMV and just say you lost your ID and they&#039;ll make you another one. Only if you get to them before your court system does. I&#039;m sure there are ways around this. My buddy told me he got another one made the day after he got his licenses suspended before they had it on file, and he just used that new ID in case he ever ran thru a road block of something. Just a quick ID replacement. Although you will still have a suspended license still on record somewhere.<br /><br />Just my two cents.<br /><br />I could be completely wrong but it may not hurt to try.. <br />idk.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />merry xmas!

				ummm ^^^ No good advice.. Sure if u only ever had to worry about is a LE looking at it, but in most cases and u get pulled there gonna run your name, And its gonna come back as suspended, sometimes u go to jail sometimes not, it all depends on the cop, but im on my 3rd driving under suspension , And have over a grand in re in statement fees, I cant mine back 2013 but My God the money and then iv now gotta get SR22 which means during my driviing time iv become a risk and its very expensive for insurance&nbsp; so if i could pay a hacker to trully get around all this for some what less it would be worth it. There is a scan bar on the back of your DL and thats what they run though their computer which brings up your record and driving file..

				^I can relate to that; I just got my license back after having it suspended for a few months...the fines and costs suck, but the worst part is losing your right to drive and having to depend on everyone else for rides. I can totally understand wanting to find a way to get rid of a DL suspension. I paid off all my fines and took the bullshit required classes right away, but still had to wait around a few months because they wouldn&#039;t give me my license back until a set date...plus those assholes take forever to do paperwork (but they sure are quick when they want to get you in trouble!)

				I feel ya..<br />I&#039;ve been thru all the same bullshit as you guys.. <br />It&#039;s a bitch, but oh well.<br />I try to stay out of those situations now and SR is a great tool for doing so.<br /><br />However, shit happens. We all know that. <br />Hope you all have a safe holidays and don&#039;t get any more tickets!
