				They&#039;re just building a new one at Altern Towers and the Sun newspaper is doing a two tickets for free if you collect the vouchers.<br />God I love roller coasters, the USA has the best but the UK is a close second. Nemesis is an all time classic, similar to the Montu, Bush Gardens Florida, I just love the hang underneath style rides. And of course there&#039;s Six Flags... 8)

				I&#039;m a sucker for magnetically accelerated ones. Joker&#039;s Jinx, Fear Factor (Or whatever it&#039;s called, at king&#039;s dominion), the volcano (bonus for hanging underneath)<br /><br />

				Hell yeah. I&#039;ve been to Six Flags St Louis, Gurnee IL, and Mexico City, and honestly I&#039;m looking for some better coasters. Hopefully I get out on a road trip to Cedar Point this year. I&#039;ve always been sober at amusement parks, but I can imagine I&#039;ll have a little molly in my system this time around.

				i smashed the shit out of my head on nemesis that was not enjoyable! for alton towers i thought air was waaay better. the sun do those free tickets every year. downside is you have to be seen in public buying the sun. my all time favourite experience would be the flying dutchman at efteling whilst tripping like crazy on shrooms :D did legoland stoned once, would not recommend.

One of the guys I work with gets The Star, have you seen that &quot;news&quot;paper? I&#039;m surprised it actually has words in it! At least you can get angry at the Daily Mail for all it&#039;s sensationalist, bigoted, narrow minded articles, but the Star is just so empty on content (apart from tits and a little sport) it really is the paper for those who find that thinking causes them headaches. Rant over.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				ahh i don&#039;t care too much about the red tops and the murdochs. they&#039;ll do their thing somewhat offensively but laughably. the mail makes me want to punch self entitled middle class bigots! there&#039;s just so much venom and bullshit from that rag it&#039;s insane. i just read the guardian on my phone so no one can judge me lol i don&#039;t look like a typical guardian reader but i did find myself listening to radio 4 and doing a sudoku whilst having a spliff the other day maybe it&#039;s infected me too deep now :D
