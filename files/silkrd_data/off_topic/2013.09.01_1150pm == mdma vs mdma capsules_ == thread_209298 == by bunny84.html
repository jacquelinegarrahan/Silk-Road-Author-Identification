The reason for this is because of the convenience of just popping it in your mouth and waiting for them tingles, rather then having to get out a bag and dabbing it or taking a quick bump. When there maybe bouncers walking around you don&#039;t want to be to obvious.<br /><br />In terms of your throwing up on previous MDMA based products I would put that down to you maybe drinking alcohol whilst rolling. I have a friend who use to always be ill and throw up whilst rolling, I told her to cut out the booze and then she wasn&#039;t throwing up, a drink here and there is fine, but excessive consumption of booze is not to great. If you don&#039;t drink then maybe you have a sensative gut which means you should perhaps dab and avoid the gut.<br /><br />Hope I&#039;ve helped!<br /><br />PlanB&nbsp; 8)
