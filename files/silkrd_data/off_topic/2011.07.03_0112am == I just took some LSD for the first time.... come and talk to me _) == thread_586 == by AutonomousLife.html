				My first time I sat by the edge of a misty lake. under a huge cypress tree that was swaying in the wind.<br />ducks were swimming, reeds were rustling, the world was ALIVE. All of it.<br /><br />enjoy your time.

				first time was red elephant gel tabs, just took one and drank a bottle of Robo.&nbsp; I was completely fucked up, at the time the most fucked up i had been by 1000X times.&nbsp; Rode around on bike, played some tag with some other friends who were tripping, hiked around on some trails (lived in the mountains) and just chilled and enjoyed life.&nbsp; &nbsp;doubtful studying will be accomplished, it is better just to relax and enjoy life.&nbsp; PS get a good set of head phones they will make music a million times sexier

				Haha! I can see you tried it instantly, good! I hope you had the best trip and are still in the afterglow now :) It might be a bit late now but ill answer your q&#039;s for the next trip you take:<br /><br />&gt;Where did you go?<br />The forest<br /><br />&gt;What did you do?<br />Wondering how and why the leaves of the trees made such beautiful structures<br /><br />&gt;Any suggestions?<br />Eat small snacks. Everything will taste 10x better. I had the best yogurt in the world on acid! And i could totally feel the structure of a kiwi etc. Eating is fun on acid. Quantity is not what counts but quality! <br /><br />&gt;How much did you take?<br />On my first trip i took 120 mics<br /><br />&gt;Will it be possible to study for school right now?<br />LOL! You will be able to answer that yourself now :D

				How did you find your trip man? By the end I am usually looking forward to being able to sleep because of all the extra mind activity.<br />Interesting to see others first trips too!<br /><br />My first trip:<br /><br />Location: Living Room &amp; Garden<br /><br />What I did: Took a step back and saw things differently. Got lost in my living room&#039;s walls, started seeing words like they where under the top coat of paint, seeing green and red tinges to things.. I had my mind blown basically, most intense and bizarrely beautiful experience I had ever been through.<br />once I could feel I was over the peak and was coming back to earth I ended up laying back with my feet up, with the lights off (complete darkness) and I put an iTunes radio station which is nothing but space noises and the odd synth sounds (it was either SomaFM mission control, or Drone Zone)<br />Anyway I highly recommend this, Its like being in a deprivation tank except the random spacey noises and occasional slow beats really influences the picture/environment that your mind builds<br /><br />Suggestions: If things get too much, or you start getting thought loops simply go to another room, or go for a walk. The change in scenery will keep everything feeling fresh, exciting and beautiful. This works for me 100% of the time.<br /><br />Dosage: I nibbled on 2 red star microdots in total. Nibbled on one then waited an hour then another one. (i don&#039;t know the dose)

				@mitanox- i didnt even think of suggesting food, every stimuli your body takes in is a million times amplified, i always liked starburst.&nbsp; Awesome flavor, an if things were getting a little hairy pop 4-5 of those bad boys and start chewing, instant happiness.

				<br />First time - my friends bought a shit load and I decided to guinea pig it. Wasn&#039;t doing anything special as I was on my way home but had a great night. It was a hoffman. I remember feeling a bit horny, and watching the light filtering through some patterned curtains moving in the breeze, as the sun came up. Music was great too.<br /><br /><br />Recently I very much enjoyed watching Scott Pilgrim Vs The World on LSD, it&#039;s funny, emotional, and very visually and musically stimulating - it&#039;s worth having good sound.

				8)<br /><br />all i can say is:<br />one hell of a ride<br /><br />i dont weigh much, around 64kg, and took 1 tab 120ug which lead to an fucking intense trip.<br />a close friend of mine took 1 tab for the first time too and he didnt have any paranoia or fear, but he weighs like 20kg more than me, so that might be the reason why.<br /><br />i had a constant feeling between paranoia, fear, fascination and excitement.<br />great expierience overall.

				My first time was 30 years ago.<br />Took purple pyramid gel at break between 2nd and 3rd period in 9th grade.<br />By 4th period (just before lunch) I realized I wasn&#039;t going back to class after lunch.<br />Our bleachers looking over the (smallish) football field was where the stoners/smokers hung out at lunch.<br />I remember really tripping by this time and was seated towards the left (looking out at the field) and seeing the grass swirling in unpredictable patterns. I looked to the right, up at the top row and the person sitting there had a beam of ??? light? energy? whatever in colors and intensity coming down on him. Whoh!<br />As the (hour or so that seemed like forever) went on the dynamics would change. people would change seats, some guy trying to fuck with me was telling me that a dog that had wandered onto campus and laid down was dieing, and the seats kept changing......but every now and then i would look up at that uppermost right seat and who ever was in it was in that beam!<br />The seats kept changing and suddenly I realized that I was in the uppermost right seat! I looked up and the beam was ???????? coming down??????enveloping??????me.<br /><br />The whole pattern of how the constant movement of people throughout the hour suddenly appeared to me and my being in that seat in that beam seemed natural, inevitable.<br /><br />Best trip ever! Other than the dickhead about the dog, who got up and wandered off of course, it was.......innocent.<br /><br />I had some really good innocent trips (sort of, staying out all night at 16 without permission) but later doses became hard to find.<br />I wanted them so bad it became an obsession. When I finally got them maybe I took too much.<br /><br />I had a couple of really bad trips that didn&#039;t put me off but made me cautious about how much to take.<br />I later heard DMT takes you in so far so fast that maybe the fear can&#039;t set in and you come down way faster. I&#039;ve been curious but still cautious.<br />The last time i tripped was a few years ago and it may have had some shit in it but it was way harder on the body than I recall as a kid. And I&#039;ve done the meth for days thing too so I know how hard it is snap back from a busing yourself but this was hard. Maybe I&#039;m to old for that shit these days.<br />

				Last weekend my wife drove me to the beach after I ate a tab, and we just sat there on a blanket and I couldn&#039;t stop watching the waves and playing with the sand. It was awesome :)
