				I&#039;m sure something similar has probably been done on the forums before but I just said I&#039;d throw a thread out there. Basically what I&#039;m looking for are people favorite bands/artists or just ones that you enjoy and which drugs you would be most partial to. I find it interesting to observe whether there are links between certain drugs and certain types of music. (Keep in mind, nobody in this thread can be right or wrong as everybody&#039;s tastes will differ).<br /><br />I look forward to reading the diverse responses (if of course people decide to participate).

				For MDMA dance music is a must. Madeon is one of my favorites.<br />For weed/psychedelics I&#039;m not really partial to anything, I just listen to random songs I like, you can&#039;t go wrong.

				Damian Marley is definitely a favorite when I&#039;m stoned, especially this: <br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awYVlAv6Cek<br /><br />When on Mdma, i just put on some caspa, rusko or pretty much any dance/fast paced rave songs.

				Was so caught up in asking the question I forgot to answer it myself. Anyway, I personally haven&#039;t got a favorite genre and listen to just about any type of music (with a few exceptions, Justin Beiber being one, as clich√© as that sounds). <br /><br />I do, however, have bands I enjoy more in certain situations. As with yourself Blackened I generally listen to random music when smoking which i usually do with friends these days as I&#039;ve cut down a lot and don&#039;t buy it very often. That being said Reggae is extremely enjoyable while stoned. Damien and his father Bob being my favorites ;). Tool and Red Hot Chili Peppers are also appealing.<br /><br />When on my drug of choice, MDMA, well it depends on the settings for me. If I&#039;m at a club or good house party old dance music can&#039;t be topped. Rave Revolution and Kernkraft 400 - Zombie Nation being prime examples. If at home or a more relaxed environment, dance music is still great, but I prefer Dubstep (which I funnily dislike otherwise).<br /><br />Haven&#039;t tried any decent psychadelics yet although they are on my wishlist now that I&#039;m beginning to avail of the Road&#039;s services.<br /><br />

				When i&#039;m buzzing on MDMA or pills, I love dance music. John Talabot is one of my current favourites. I&#039;d highly recommend him. I also like SBTRKT, Nicolas Jaar, Gaudi, Four Tet and the list goes on...<br /><br />When i&#039;m on acid, I like bands such as Pink Floyd, Beach House, and genres like Psychill, Psybient, Ambient. <br /><br />The sounds of the dishwasher is good when tripping on acid as well ;) ;) ;) Everything is great when you&#039;re on acid :)<br /><br />

				Mogwai is definitely good no matter what drug.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />If I&#039;m rolling or tripping really hard, Ephixa, Dub Police, GetDarker, Liquid Stranger, Monstercat, Ratatat, SBTRKT, Zeds Dead, PANTyRAID, We Bang. <br /><br />(mostly dance/dubstep)<br /><br />sdesu<br /><br />

				My Morning Jacket is amazing when on pretty much anything. I was listening to their song Cobra while at the tail end of a rather high dose of MXE, it was just mind blowing and sort of sent me drifting through other worlds for a while.

But i arrange my playlist order differently. <br /><br />Here are some of my favorite albums/songs. <br /><br />The Jimi Hendrix Experience: Electric Ladyland<br /><br />-One of the greatest albums of all time. We all know his hits like voodoo child, all along the watchtower, etc. But i consider &quot;1983, a Merman i Should Turn to Be&quot; (13 minute song) and &quot;Rainy Day, Dream Away/Still Raining Still Dream&quot; (1 song spliced to into 2, 8 minutes total)&nbsp; Psychedelic Masterpieces. They both make you feel like you&#039;re in a dream. <br /><br />&quot;Long hot summer night&quot; is more of a blues psychedelia, just a great song in general. <br /><br />A few songs off his other albums: &quot;The Stars that Play with Laughing Sam&#039;s Dice&quot; (STP with LSD) is a mind fuck, &quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot;, &quot;Power of Soul&quot;, &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (ofcourse). Can&#039;t go wrong with any of them. <br /><br />MGMT: All of their albums are loaded with neo psychedelic audio paintings. My favorites are&quot; It&#039;s Working&quot; (which is about MDMA), &quot;Electric Feel&quot;, and &quot;4th Dimensional Transition&quot; (They did alot of DMT)<br /><br />Pink Floyd: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. &quot;Us and Them&quot; was the first song i ever tripped to. Listening to it sober can bring tears of joys to my eyes. <br /><br />Tame Impala: Another Neo Psychedelic Band. &quot;Innerspeaker&quot; is their only album to date, one of my all time favorites. Check out the song &quot;When the Feelings in the Core&quot;, one of my favorite songs to trip to. <br /><br />Cream: &quot;White Room&quot;, &quot;Strange Brew&quot; &quot;SWLABR&quot;, just to name a few. <br /><br />We should check out each others recommended songs, tripping or not, and leave some feedback :D Im always looking for new music.
