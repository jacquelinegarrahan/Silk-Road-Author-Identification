				I want some snozberries. ;)<br /><br />But thanks! Also to any vendor who would like to join up with us, better do it soon.&nbsp; We have quite a few vendors coming our way as a secondary market, or just simply to expand and we WILL be changing how we do things in the near future.&nbsp; Right now, if you&#039;re a vendor on SR with a good solid history, you&#039;re free to come aboard. Don&#039;t wait too long as we will be charging seller fees in the not so distant future.&nbsp; If you&#039;re a new vendor and want to come aboard, you&#039;ll need to put down a safety desposit, but please get in touch with us first.<br /><br />Also, no, we&#039;re not wanting you to abandon SR ofc.&nbsp; This is an alternate market for vendors if SR is down so you&#039;re still making money.<br /><br />Commissions are lower, but then again, so is our traffic at the moment.&nbsp; Perhaps since it&#039;s a lower commission rate, you can charge your customers less to? eh? eh? ;)

				I would like to remind/warn everyone that, just like Silk Road, and just like BMR, this market could be a federal honeypot.<br /><br />Silk Road has operated without any kind of major sting, so far. Hopefully that means Silk Road is not a honeypot. It was the first to, well... the marketplace and as we all know, the feds are shit at being the first to anything, but BMR and Sluj? Take caution, take care, don&#039;t use a similar-at-all password, encrypt fucking everything.<br /><br />But then, the same is true for over here. Jus&#039; being a realist, Sluj-man. Hope you understand.

The money system seems sounds, this could be a very beneficial market if it is tailored to the right people to keep out scammers, kids, other problems SR has, etc.<br /><br />:)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes the money system is designed for multiple reasons.&nbsp; It&#039;s like this for the following reasons:<br /><br />A.) It&#039;s a set price on Snuj Dollars, so that vendors can list their prices in USD format and sell it in USD format or in Snuj Dollars.<br />B.) It doesn&#039;t depreciate the value of the BTC from internal sending and the vendor can choose when they want their payout to get the most out of their cashout value.<br />C.) It&#039;s transparent, since the money isn&#039;t going through any other outside source, it&#039;s all internal at that point and within $0.10 accurate of each order, nothing to complain about if you&#039;re left with 1 Snuj Dollar in your account, because it&#039;s only $0.10USD and I&#039;ve yet to meet someone who will cry over that small amount of money.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are things that we will run into, being a new market; but we do want to wish everyone who joins a warm welcome and hope that we can be a reliable source outside of SR/BMR for future purchases.<br /><br />Thanks you two for the feedback, and I am always open to suggestions/feedback/comments.&nbsp; I guess I should also mention, I will be around a lot, so if there are issues with the site you&#039;re not in the dark, which is always a bonus.<br /><br />-Jimmy

(And if I&#039;m wrong about the bitcoins, that&#039;s because I don&#039;t trust it enough to even visit the site.)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To answer the quetions of Blargh first, with a followup to moksa..<br /><br />Firstly there is SOME proof, we&#039;re obviously sitll new as I have mentioned previously, but the vendors that are on there have links underneath their name linking them to the market they came from and the likewise link referring back to Snuj (Not Slug haha) is in there profile as SR has no where stated that providing a link to outside communications are not allowed it is against their TOS to market or ask to sell outside of SR.&nbsp; None of the vendors are asking, they simply have a link listed, which is less equivalent to having their email listed where they could perform &quot;moon lighting&quot; anyhow if they so choose to do so; likewise I suppose that is also possible within our market or for that matter any other market out there as long as there is some form of outside communication allowed it&#039;s plausible for it to happen thus making it not smiled upon, though it causes less of a risk to their TOS than providing an email address, which every vendor does have.<br /><br />Secondly to the first quoted reply, just because I&#039;m honest and trying to do my best at being as transparent as possible while maintaining my personal identity doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m a scumbag also, I&#039;m assuming the, &quot;smart scumbag&quot; would be because I try to reply to every response in a as professional voice as I am trying to take this into a business, granted not legitimate in anyway, shape or form; nevertheless doesn&#039;t mean I cannot act professionaly, curtious and well spoken, while being as informative as possible.&nbsp; Not trying to point fingers at you as in trying to flip it around on you.&nbsp; I wanted to be firm about that stance and get that in the open for everyone to see.&nbsp; I take pride in what I do, and I love what I do as well.<br /><br />To Moksha: You&#039;re right, it definitely is on the, &quot;dick-ish&quot; side, however, what other options are out there.&nbsp; The means in which SR became available is by enevitably doing the same thing.&nbsp; They don&#039;t get indexed, crawled and searched for such as with a normal TLD.&nbsp; It&#039;s not the way I wanted to go to ask for some publicity; but outside of the other places I have already posted, there simply is no better way of advertisement then simple word of mouth.&nbsp; So yes, I don&#039;t disagree that it very likely is against their ToS, I&#039;m just hoping that by using the tactfulness of each post, I will provide far better service helping this wonderful community as well as mine in the future. <br /><br />Back to BlarghRawr:<br />I am not familiar with BMR&#039;s marketplace; I have never been a client/customer of theirs as I have always used SR and SR exclusively, so I cannot even speak for what they&#039;ve done and personally it has nothing to do with me, so I really don&#039;t want to read about what sounds to me like huge problem over there, I&#039;m confident we won&#039;t have the same issues. <br /><br />As for Bitcoins, yes we do absolutely use them, that is the only way to purchase these items.&nbsp; The, &quot;Snuj Dollars&quot; are internal currency so once the Bitcoins are received each mBTC to BTC is worth a certain amount respectively to it&#039;s last, it would need no market and if there was it would be no more or less than the BTC market since they&#039;re value is in equal proportions to the volatile market of BTC anyhow.<br /><br />How the internal money system works is practically the same way, though, now that I&#039;m bringing it up in a sentence and thinking into it more, I do need to modify the ability of others to see each others balances and remove it.&nbsp; However, with that money system it in the end works the exact same way as SR or any other market would.&nbsp; It has a value attached to how much internal money was transferred to the vendor (along with the PM of their address to send their items to) and the vendor is able, along with all the users, able to see their transaction history under the, &quot;Bank&quot; menu.&nbsp; We have it setup in mBTC so you can get down to the $0.10USD price of each order so you won&#039;t have a lot of spare worth your while left on the site.<br /><br />The reason we chose this system was that some vendors find it easier to price their items out in USD or they can do it in Snuj if they like, but it offers them the flexibilty to easily modify their prices if needed and not necassarily worry about how the market is with BTC, it&#039;s at a USD rate and essentially it works the same as SR does.<br /><br />-- My personal thoughts, not to reflect Snuj --<br />Guys, I really do not mind the critisism, I try to find some positive feedback somewhere in there on things I can work on, improve etc. before Snuj gets larger.&nbsp; So bad or good, I&#039;ll stick with my &quot;Mr. Nice Guy&quot; title, because fuck it.. I&#039;m stoned, I&#039;m in a good mood and I jsut typed a bunch of shit out, because I care about what I&#039;m doing.&nbsp; I&#039;m out here answering questions and comments at 4AM in the morning.&nbsp; I love what I&#039;m doing and I hope others see it too.<br /><br />&quot;Mr Nice Guy&quot;<br />-Jimmy

The coins won&#039;t be &quot;from Silk Road&quot; anymore, so the only thing they&#039;ll need is a no-traces mixer. A bit less safe; Transferring coins from the customer directly into a place like MTGox. Legally speaking, since Gox would turn over all details should they get a subpoena, if traceable accounts on the Gox were used, that would make an arrest real easy. But a good stealth-mixer throws out that issue, because the coins would have no legally-discernible connection to the drug-buy.<br /><br />Not as safe for buyers, though. No escrow means no protection. No forum means no community reports... So a market is safer for the buyer, and no market is safer for the seller.

Hell, I do the majority of my business with vendors outside of SR but your average buyer has never experienced anything outside the marketplace...There&#039;s too many con artists to do this successfully these days anyways unless you are connected from before SR.<br /><br />As for you having multiple top 10 vendors, if this is true I would like some verification. <br />Well, because for obvious reasons. It might not really be them, just another scam....<br /><br />Good luck to you if you&#039;re legit hope it works out well for you, good day.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Every single one of our vendors has both referring and backlinking from the market they came from, so if a vendor is on Snuj it has their user profile link in their signature.&nbsp; On the corresponding market, they have a link to their profile on Snuj, thus making it as transparent as possible to provide the identity of each vendor.&nbsp; Hope that clears that up and can illeviate some concerns on it being a possible scam.&nbsp; Again, not all of our vendors are on board yet.&nbsp; Some will be coming soon, more to follow as they are busy and don&#039;t have the time this very second to put the information in; however I&#039;ve been emailed by a lot of vendors who said they&#039;re interested and they&#039;re wanting to get put on the site.

				Awesome day for Snuj!&nbsp; We have had our very first transaction and we are waiting on the feedback to come in within the next week I hope.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure it will be positive.&nbsp; Hope to see more people order here in the near future, especially when more vendors get in there.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m the one that order something. I&#039;ll post back on everything bout the transaction. As far as i&#039;m concerned it&#039;s legit. The 2 vendors on the site atm have good rep from SR and another site.

				Yesterday we had our first transaction along with nearly 10 new members.&nbsp; Quite happy to see things moving along quite well.&nbsp; We also implemented some security updates, along with a new rule for BTC/Cash Vendors have somewhat different rules than members selling good, but nothing that would detour any legitimate vendors, only scammers!<br /><br />-Jimmy

				I misunderstood the context.&nbsp; I mean, sure you&#039;re right, I just risked myself there.&nbsp; Good call, I&#039;ll give you that, however, how many people do they need to figure out with what was retracted to end up with a long list of everybody&#039;s. <br /><br />My apologies, I simply misunderstood what you were referring to.

				Well, I&#039;m glad to say we&#039;re up to 55 members thus far, only still a few vendors, (might have to remind the other SR vendors, who said they wanted on, time is of the essence.)<br /><br />We&#039;re still awaiting the confirmation of our first vendor review, which I&#039;m very happy about.&nbsp; Hopefully within the next 3-5 days, we should know, I&#039;m assuming.<br /><br />If anyone has any feedback on something, please do not hesitate to respond, I would like to resolve any security or any other potential problems, before we do get a lot bigger.<br /><br />Thanks, another warm welcome to the new group of members to Snuj! :)<br /><br />-Jimmy
