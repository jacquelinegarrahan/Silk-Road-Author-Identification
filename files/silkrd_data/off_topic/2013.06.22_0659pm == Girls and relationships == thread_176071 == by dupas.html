				Hi everybody!<br /><br />I would be interested if there are guys (and maybe girls) who handle relationships similar to me. I&#039;m older and in the last decades every relationship, except two which were quite some time ago, went like this:<br />I get her known. we start dating and have sex pretty soon (Usually first or second date). I already know that i don&#039;t want a &quot;real&quot; relationship with her and tell her that after a few weeks, when the topic comes up in which direction our relationship is going. It is fine for her and so we decide to have a sexual relationship. Everything goes well for some time, we meet quite often and have a lot of sex :). Suddenly she tells me that she felt in love with me and wants to be together with me, but i don&#039;t. Now there are two possibilities:<br />.) She decides to quit the relationship, cause she feels sad since i don&#039;t want a relationship with her, or<br />.) she continues our sexual relationship, because she thinks that i eventually change my mind. But i don&#039;t. In this case i continue till i get bored and sex with her doesn&#039;t excite me anymore.<br /><br />Since this happend SO often, i wonder what is wrong with me ;) Is anybody experiencing the same? I hope that i expressed myself clear, since i&#039;m pretty high.<br /><br />dupas<br /><br /><br /><br />

				don&#039;t have sexual relations. just treat them like royalty. the girls who your having problems with now will be turned off because likely they want only the unatainable.

				My lady friend is a similar situation. We were dating seriously a couple years ago, but I wasn&#039;t prepared to move to be closer to her, so we split up. In the last year, we&#039;ve been hanging out from time to time. I just have too much going on in my life, with work, volunteering and my kid, so I can&#039;t commit to being in a girlfriend / boyfriend situation.

				Yeah, hump &amp; dump!<br /><br />No seriously though. Am I the only guy who actually wants a serious relationship with a girl. Things go fine for a little while until we both realize were like clinging onto eachother, then things deteriorate after that. I&#039;ve only fucked a girl I didnt even know once at a bus stop, other than that just in what I thought were serious relationships. (But then again I just graduated high school so idk. Is hump &amp; dump the way to live life?)

				Agreed, but I do believe dupas is trying to just keep this girl as a fuck buddy, but is worried she will &quot;fall in love&quot;<br />I have had this happen with a fuck buddy.. Guess she liked more then just my dick. :)<br />Really all you can do is be honest. If you loose this one, find another. It seems you don&#039;t have problems with finding women.

				Yeah, if there&#039;s one thing that guys can do to insure that you won&#039;t turn a girl too fucking insane, is to BE HONEST. Honesty is the best policy. Don&#039;t tell a girl you love her if you don&#039;t. Don&#039;t tell a girl that you&#039;re going to be in a relationship with her if you&#039;re not. Then again, girls should be straightforward too. Girls should tell a guy what she wants before she starts giving anything up. It saves A LOT of time on both parts.<br />I&#039;m young but I think I&#039;m too old for that fuck buddy stuff, I just don&#039;t think I&#039;d enjoy fucking a random stranger from a club like most people my age do. I&#039;m loving my relationship right now :D My bf believes that our success is because he feels like he wants/needs to please, and I like to be pleased. It&#039;s strange but it works. He tells me to want want want, give a little, and want more. And to not be a bitch :D<br /><br />But yeah, don&#039;t turn a girl into a Jodi, and don&#039;t hook up with a Jodi either.

A short tutorial:<br />.) Go outside. Easier to get girls know: Private parties. Harder: bars/clubs ...<br />.) Be interested in her, listen to what she says. Ask more questions. Good topics: Relationships, Relationships you had with other girls. Fun fact: Many girls are interested in guys that had many girls and are experienced. Don&#039;t brag about stuff you achieved. Talk more about her life and emotional stuff. Tease them. Be charming.<br />.) If you are finally at her place, don&#039;t be shy. Just start touching her. Many girls like dominant guys. Shy guys turn them off. Make sex enjoyable for them, don&#039;t be selfish. Otherwise they won&#039;t like to meet you again ;)<br /><br />If anybody is interested, i can write a little bit on how to get anal sex ;)<br />Puhh ... i&#039;m high as fuck. haha!<br /><br />dupas

				Not my pattern, Dumas, but I believe what you&#039;ve described to be common enough to be a cliche (no offence intended). <br /><br />Partly because someone developing feelings is the most common way for fuck buddies to run into trouble (if everything is going well, it&#039;s not like the opposite, detachment, is going to be much of a problem), and partly because it&#039;s kind of stereotypically standard (at least for a previous generation) that the woman will fall for the guy once they start sleeping together - that whole mixing sex and love thing - which may or may no longer be all that common.<br /><br />That&#039;s my $.02, anyway.

				Definitely fun to have random sex and multiple partners, but if these relationships last too long they inevitably end with one party desiring more than the previous arrangement intended.<br /><br />Find someone you can love and respect and just enjoy time with (even not having sex ;-)<br /><br />Kneo

Having had many girls somehow destroys the ability to fall in love for me. I think it&#039;s connected that i know how all relationships end eventually and therefore i can&#039;t fall in a relationship without thinking how could end. I also know how easy girls betray their boyfriends, since i was many times the one whom they betrayed their boyfriend with ...<br /><br />Something that might also be connected with experience &amp; my age:<br />Sex is sometimes repulsing for me. It is just not as it used to be for me when i was younger. For example anal sex: It was really exciting having anal sex with a girl, especially if it is the first time for her, but nowadays when a get a new girl know which hasn&#039;t had anal sex, things exactly go the way like with all the girls before. It is just a repetition of stuff i have experienced before and that makes it boring. <br />Sex becomes just mechanical with hardly any emotion involved. For the girls it&#039;s mostly fun, but for me there aren&#039;t any feelings involved. <br /><br />Yeah, i have no idea what is wrong with me. <br />I hope that i expressed myself clear, cause i&#039;m again high as fuck. Being high all the time would be nice, since then i wouldn&#039;t have to think about all this shit.<br /><br />dupas

				She obviously likes something about you... Maybe that something was part of the reason you ever got to have sex with her. Just accept that she feels that way and do whatever you want to do about it. Personally I would stop it there for many reasons. Then stick to one night stands as many are suggesting.

				You&#039;re doing the right thing, man. Just use American/western women for sex and then dump them. They are useless for anything other than sex. They don&#039;t cook, they don&#039;t clean, they make horrible wives, etc. Just pump and dump them.

				Since i&#039;m quite high and have nothing to do, i&#039;ll tell my SR-brothers how to get anal sex with a girl they have an relationship with. Actually this works also with one-night-stands ;)<br /><br />The first and most important rule: Never ever ask a girl, if she&#039;d like to try anal sex. I repeat never ask! The trick is that girls like to be dominated and are excited by guys doing kinky stuff with them. Of course there are exceptions to this rule, but in general you are safe to assume, that it is like this ;)<br /><br />So the next time you have sex you start playing a little bit with her butthole, i.e. rub it gently, stick your finger in a bit and so on. Important: Use some natural lubricant (spit or her pussy juice), otherwise it will be not comfortable for her which will drag us away from our goal to stick our dick in. Also do it when she is already really horny, cause in that state of mind she won&#039;t have the power to resist ;). The main point is that being touched on the butthole feels for EVERY girl nice, the only reason they don&#039;t like to try it in the first place is that they think it is too kinky or dirty down there ... <br />Good positions: If she is on top, spread her cheeks and play with her butthole. While licking her pussy or rubbing her clit is also a good situation to check her butt out :)<br />Continue with this anal games for the next times you have sex. Either she asks by herself if you want to stick your dick in the next time -&gt; won. If not try it yourself ;). For example, if she lies on her side with the back to you, use a lot of spit to make your dick wet and take even more spit for her asshole. Then start rubbing with your penis against her butthole. After doing this for quite some time (don&#039;t try it too fast!) you can point your dick at her butthole and push your dick against it. Never use to much force, otherwise it will hurt her.<br /><br />at this point some general note: <br />Tightness of butts greatly differ between women. Some are tight as fuck. With these ones it takes a lot of time to finally have anal sex. You will notice that is already hard to get more than one finger up their butt. Sometimes this is connected to the fact that they are not relaxed enough, but there are also anatomical differences btw. women.<br />Other chicks are really wide. In fact they are so wide, that you don&#039;t feel that much when you fuck them in the butt.<br /><br />another important topic: hygiene.<br />in general you don&#039;t have to be afraid to have your dick covered in shit, but there is always the possibility. Countermeasures: Since in most cases you have your finger up her butt before you fuck her in the ass, you can check your finger after you inserted it. if there are shit stains on it, you know what you can expect for your dick&nbsp; ;). i would also advice against anal sex if you can feel a turd with your finger. <br />Some might prefer using a condom. i never did ;)<br /><br />I might write more later, or just ask. I doubt this text is of any use, but since it took some time to write it, i hit send now :)<br /><br />dupas <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				I hear ya man, I have a similar problem, tho I think I am a little bit different. I am a romantic at heart, I love doing nice little things for a girl, so I often find myself in trouble when a girl falls in love with me, and I am only interested in her for sex and entertainment. I am often in your predicament. I think I am different than you tho, because I think my problem is that I just have not found the right girl. I have super high standards, I want a beautiful girl, gorgeous eyes, an amazing ass...breasts...whatever, im an ass man, and just as important as that is a good personality and intelligence. A stupid girl is a huge turn off for me, those are my one night stand type girls when all else fails, I just can&#039;t stand a stupid girl. The problem is, I have a hard time of finding a beautiful girl who is smart and funny who is also single and interested in me. I actually met a girl who I really got into, and we used to fuck once in a while, but she didn&#039;t feel for me the same I felt for her, so I ended up being the one who got hurt. Which sucks.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know about you, maybe you just need to find the right girl as well, but I don&#039;t think there is anything wrong with you. If anything, I think there is something wrong with the standards of society and the expectations of women. If you are like me, us guys just need to find our queen, all the others are our play things. Not necessarily in a bad way, I am always up front about my intentions, if you are not, you are a d-bag. If that does not sound like you, if you are not a romantic like me, searching for a goddess, have not found the right girl that you want to stick around with, then I don&#039;t know. But I def feel you, I have felt the same way as you, like something is wrong with me for getting bored of beautiful girls. It is just that I can&#039;t see myself with them, there is something about them as a person that I don&#039;t want to get tangled up in for the rest of my life and sit on the sidelines while the goddess who would have made me happy is out there. <br /><br />You say you are older, so maybe you are a little older than me, I am only in my 20&#039;s, but I def feel you, and I do not think anything is wrong with you. Possibly. I mean, maybe something is wrong with you and you are just never satisfied and you will piss away all your chances at love and end up a lonely old man dying alone, haha, who knows. I know that is a fear I have. But I think in reality I, and most likely you are alright, we just need to find the right girl.<br /><br />Or maybe I am way off base, I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m gonna go take another hit. hah.<br /><br />cheers

IME if you throw sex into a very new relationship, it takes out a lot of the fun of getting to know each other, the anticipation, the excitement of WANTING to be with them. delayed gratification can be much more satisfying sometimes. if you start sleeping with someone before you really know that you want to be with them, you may be losing interest because part of that &#039;chase,&#039; the exciting fun part of getting to know someone, has been removed, and you&#039;ve already got the sex, so you may be less inclined to be as interested in the rest of the package. just a thought.

Again: Sex was good, but not good enough for a relationship. Or i didn&#039;t like the way they dress. This is a pretty important point for me: I&#039;m attracted to girls that dress well. Badly dressed girls turn me off.<br />&nbsp;Anyways, maybe I&#039;ll find my girl in the future. I hope so, cause I begin to hate this sexual relationships. It is better than nothing, but far from what I want.<br />Of course I tell the girls that I&#039;m not up for a &quot;real&quot; relationship beforehand. I&#039;m a nice guy and not an idiot ;)<br />Batin, I&#039;m an ass guy as well. I love nothing more than asses. It so fun to touch them and do even more stuff with them as you will see in the next paragraph ;)<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SourGrapes</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LOL i&#039;m surprised if this has worked for you on many occasions, most women i know DO NOT like to be &#039;surprised&#039; with anal sex. the one guy who tried this with me got slapped in the face -- if you want to play with my ass you best damn well ask first, and that&#039;s the policy most women i know subscribe to. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting, interesting! Yeah, anal sex worked quite often for me this way. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t just stick my dick up their ass. There is of course a lot of ass play going on before, so that they are relaxed :). <br />I think the main reason, why it works for me this way, is that the girls I start &quot;relationships&quot; with were pretty submissive and I&#039;m sexually-wise dominant. This reflected in our sexual practices: They liked to get tied up, enjoyed being in doggy-style position so that I can see their pussy and ass well and me playing with both holes with my fingers and various kinds of dildos or them lying on their back with their legs widely spread and me having one finger or more up their ass while i rub their clit till they climax.<br />They were excited by the thought that they are completely passive and i do with them whatever i like to. It is a win-win situation, since i enjoy being the active part :)<br />Or maybe my approach won&#039;t work for you cause of cultural differences. I think not, but who knows ;) Are you from the US? I&#039;m from western Europe. One thing I noticed, when being together with an american girl, was their different approach to hygiene. She always showered before and after sex, which was quite weird. I guess this had nothing to do with her being American, but with her being strange ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SourGrapes</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">have you tried getting to know a woman before getting sexually involved? as in more than just one or two dates..</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#039;t wait that long, cause I want them so much. I want to touch their skin, kiss her, stroke her ass and pussy. Waiting too long, would make me go insane ;)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SourGrapes</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> i wouldnt sleep with a man on a first or second date, simply because i dont think it&#039;s possible to know someone well enough in that short time, to determine whether we&#039;re compatible for a relationship.. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That is true. If i would have waited longer till we had&nbsp; sex for the first time, i would have noticed that a real relationship won&#039;t work out with them. But since we have sex early, it turns for me into a sexual relationship.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: SourGrapes</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> if you start sleeping with someone before you really know that you want to be with them, you may be losing interest because part of that &#039;chase,&#039; the exciting fun part of getting to know someone, has been removed, and you&#039;ve already got the sex, so you may be less inclined to be as interested in the rest of the package. just a thought.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hmm ... I don&#039;t lose interest because the chase for sex is over, but because after a few months sex with them isn&#039;t that interesting anymore or because they get to close to me and I feel restricted by them ...<br /><br />I hope I expressed myself not too unclear. I&#039;m still high from yesterday :)<br /><br />dupas

				I normally do not post, but even though I am in my early 20s, I feel like I am having a serious breakthrough with my success with women. I feel like I am obligated to post.<br /><br />At this point I have lost almost all respect I have for women, and ironically enough I have somehow been getting pussy more and more easily as this lack of respect grows. I feel like Albert einstein whilst being in a room full of retards. I feel like 90% of girls that are cosmetically 7/10 or greater have 0 intelligence and just poor human beings in general. If you start fucking a girl that is in this 90%, take advantage of her and dont feel bad about it. they are not worth keeping around for anything more than casual purposes, and they will end up doing you wrong in the end if you actually make an effort to treat her as a human being should. Never bring up the topic of being in an official relationship, and if she brings up the topic just blow it off or tell her that &quot;we are just having fun&quot;. Girls think they know what they want, but they really dont. they want to get fucked all the time, but they dont want to be a &quot;slut&quot;. how many girls do you know that call other girls sluts? how many of these same girls fucked you on the first night? do not give them the courtesy of logic. do not tell them that they are your piece of meat. they are your piece of meat, but do not say it outloud. i dont know where i am going with this, but here is the analogy: you are alone in a room with a woman and a noose hanging from the ceiling. The woman asks you if you are going to hang her. As you explain to her that you would never do such a thing, you calmly start slipping the noose around her neck. when she asks why you would put a noose around her neck if you did not want to hang her, you explain that you simply just wanted to see if the rope was of high quality. as you proceed to put tension on the rope to lift her off the ground, you explain that you are simply just giving her feet a rest.<br /><br />In the end, you did exactly what the woman told you not to do. all you did was presented things from a different perspective.<br /><br />If a brought a girl home and for some reason she told me she didnt want to go into my room, I would start talking about this awesome thing on the computer (that is in my room) that I need to show her. So when I bring her into my room and sit her down at the computer, shes not breaking her rule, because shes simply just sitting at my computer, and not &quot;going&quot; into my room. <br /><br />They are retarded creatures. they are narrow minded and are manipulated easily. eventually they are going to get rid of you after a few months regardless of your opinion. use them, and abuse them.<br /><br />As for the other 10%, this is where I believe the actual wifeable population exists.<br /><br />this all makes perfect sense in my head, but I doubt anyone will understand the point I am trying to get across. <br /><br />TL;DR: WOMEN WILL DO ANYTHING YOU TELL THEM TO DO, AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A REASON (doesnt matter how shitty of a reason it is) FOR THEMSELVES TO JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS. Take advantage of slutty women and dont ever feel bad about it.&nbsp; taking a slutty woman seriously (in a relationship type setting) will just end in her chucking you out into the street based on the decision that her and her friends made in a 10 minute conversation based on exagerrated or false information.<br /><br />the end.<br /><br />ALSO<br /><br />the key to pulling pussy is self amusement. cocky funny with a hint of arrogance always wins and nice guys ALWAYS finish last. Say rediculous shit that you find hilarious to yourself. women feel vibes and do not give a shit about the concrete information at hand. I could talk about how awesome it was mowing my lawn today and as long as I was into it she would be entertained.

				wow @ TylerDurden. while i tend to agree that most women are stupid, i also have to point out most men are sex-obsessed douchebag morons. people, as a species, are gullible, naive, and tend to believe whatever it is they want to cling to. the fact that you can search out the dumbest, most easily-manipulated women doesn&#039;t make women less respectable -- it makes you less respectable, for thinking it&#039;s an appropriate thing to do to other human beings. being easily manipulated is certainly not exclusive to women -- why are there so many conventionally beautiful women getting by on looks alone? because PEOPLE LET THEM. because there are plenty of dick-led idiots (men) who will DO anything, SAY anything, and PAY anything, for a cute ass or a nice set of tits, just to get between her legs -- regardless of whether there&#039;s anything between her ears. and there are plenty of women who will take advantage of these morons, just as you take advantage of the stupid ladies. and yet, i&#039;m guessing thats one of those things you complain about when you say you don&#039;t respect women. with that attitude, none of the intelligent ones will respect you either, and you&#039;ll be left with your own stupidity and the idiot girls you deserve.

				Tyler, your attitudes are bullshit.&nbsp; Let me explain.<br /><br />Firstly, I think it&#039;s great that you&#039;ve found a way to get bimbos and damaged women to sleep with you.&nbsp; In my early 20&#039;s I wish I&#039;d had the skills to get more pussy because man, I sure could&#039;ve done with some more, but you seem to have a system that works for you.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you&#039;re a fairly handsome, white, middle class American kid too, so I&#039;m sure that has helped with your access to easy bimbos, damaged daddy&#039;s girls, and girls called Britney. Nice work, I&#039;m envious.<br /><br />However, I have a problem with your statistics.&nbsp; You make sweeping generalisations about a gender claiming that you &#039;know&#039; about 90% of women and how they work and what they want, and you then proceed to make ridiculous claims based on that. A white middle class 20something knows about 90% of women huh?&nbsp; Wow, you must be a hugely celebrated Anthropologist and researcher.<br /><br />I was wondering, do you have any other well thoughtout stereotypical generalisations about 0.0000000000000000000000000001 of the world?&nbsp; How do you feel about Blacks, Muslims or Jews perhaps?&nbsp; The world really does need your opinion on these.<br /><br />On a less scientific level, there is the slight issue of you being a bit of a cunt and thinking it&#039;s okay to hurt and use people just because you can.&nbsp; I mean, &#039;no harm no foul&#039; if you&#039;re turning on your charm and giving women what they want, but if you&#039;re just going around being a smarmy little privileged cunt with a chip on your shoulder and you&#039;ve justified your actions to yourself by demonising and marginalising and entire gender based on nothing but your own gross prejudices and stereotypes, well then we have a problem.<br /><br />Me personally, I think having a &#039;way with women&#039; is great, and it&#039;s a skill I wish I had more of, but if the trade off was being a complete idiot and arsehole on a multiples of levels, I think I&#039;d pass.

				Well let me dissagree with @TylerDurden too.&nbsp; I am quite a bit older than my 20&#039;s and have had a lot of sex and I have met a lot of smart, good looking women.&nbsp; I meet dumb people too and suspect that TylerDurden thinks he is smarter than he is.&nbsp; I am sure he is having fun but even when I was in my teens/twenties and looking to fuck anything that moved I wanted it to leave me and my partners feeling good about it and I look back now on lots of fun times and (hopefully) not being a callous shit, I still got laid a lot.<br /><br />I am lucky to have a long term GF now who is smart, great in bed and likes getting high.&nbsp; We both enjoy occaisional threesomes and similar, I doubt I would be having as much fun now if I had taken the TylerDurden approach....cos I wouldnt have many friends to play with.<br /><br />

				I&#039;m probably the opposite of you guys. I don&#039;t know how to make &quot;small talks&quot;<br /><br />Whenever I talk to girls I like, I get shy and don&#039;t know what to say and I freeze up :\ any tips on how to pick up girls? ;]<br /><br />P.S. I&#039;m in college and I want to enjoy my college life.. I don&#039;t see a very enjoyable college life the way my personality is right now..

				Wow, saw the title of this thread and thought I&#039;d have a read but didn&#039;t expect to be reading for so long..interesting.&nbsp; no offence but I&#039;m not going to add to this really, I&#039;ll just post what I originally planned to.&nbsp; &#039;Guys - We want girls, so we put up with relationships&#039;&nbsp; &#039;Girls - You want relationships, so you put up with guys&#039;&nbsp; am I right? thats all I&#039;ve got anyway.<br />.<br />Anyway needed a dose of hetrosexual talk seeing as though everytime I log on lately the first thing I read is the thread about the dude who did that thing for the first time, ya know the one?.&nbsp; Just leaves a bad taste in the mouth really&nbsp; ;) pun intended.

I&#039;m older and in the last decades every relationship, except two which were quite some time ago, went like this:<br />I get her known. we start dating and have sex pretty soon (Usually first or second date). I already know that i don&#039;t want a &quot;real&quot; relationship with her and tell her that after a few weeks, when the topic comes up in which direction our relationship is going. It is fine for her and so we decide to have a sexual relationship. Everything goes well for some time, we meet quite often and have a lot of sex :). Suddenly she tells me that she felt in love with me and wants to be together with me, but i don&#039;t. Now there are two possibilities:<br />.) She decides to quit the relationship, cause she feels sad since i don&#039;t want a relationship with her, or<br />.) she continues our sexual relationship, because she thinks that i eventually change my mind. But i don&#039;t. In this case i continue till i get bored and sex with her doesn&#039;t excite me anymore.<br /><br />Since this happend SO often, i wonder what is wrong with me ;) Is anybody experiencing the same? I hope that i expressed myself clear, since i&#039;m pretty high.<br /><br />dupas<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds like no one taught you delayed gratification.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You&#039;ll would be surprised to find out how much more desirable you&#039;ll find the women in your life, if you hold back from having sex for a while.&nbsp; Even if that sounds lame, it&#039;s not.&nbsp; Let your mind dwell in it&#039;s curiosities for a while and you&#039;re bound to grow fonder.&nbsp; It&#039;s virtually a law of nature.<br /><br />From experience, I will say that is 100% true that we desire what we can&#039;t or shouldn&#039;t have, and we grow bored of things if they&#039;re not complicated enough for us.&nbsp; When a girl throws herself at you... you will most likely treat her the exact same way that 95% of women would treat any ol&#039; guy who threw themselves at her.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess a bit of advice if you&#039;re just too fond of instant or short-term gratification to keep it in your pants that long... maybe you should do what I have always done, and see a few different girls until you find one who you actually want to be around after you cum.&nbsp; I only find 1 out of about 20 females attractive, and I only find about 1 in 10 of those actually &#039;interesting&#039; beyond physical form.&nbsp; And this has worked for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of us are just picky; we bore easy.&nbsp;

				One thing that I can not seem to grasp is what I learned is called a &quot;friend zone&quot;. I seem to be put into this frequently and figure its due to me being to nice, however if I&#039;m not&nbsp; that nice I&#039;m just a dick..
