				Hi - so I have been an active (yet silent) member of the forums the past few months with around 8 Silk Road purchases under my belt. <br /><br />A few months ago, I ordered LSD and tried it for the first time in mid October. Since then, everything has been great and I really enjoyed the the stuff. Anyway, tonight I was just going about my business, when all of a sudden I saw all of these very colorful geometric patterns and wavy images. It is very distracting, especially if I try to focus on one thing.&nbsp; Could this be the LSD back again or are my eyes just fucked up? Haha&nbsp; Is this a common thing to happen to first time users? <br /><br />Also, just popped my SR Forum Discussion Cherry. Good stuff!

So, if you do something that releases serotonin naturally you can have a &quot;flashback&quot;. There is a myth that LSD stays in your spinal cord forever and if you manage to pop your back and neck the right way. You&#039;ll trip again because it&#039;s released into the blood stream. I say myth because no one has proved this theory.

				Yes I would agree with sniper - you need to try LSD! I&#039;m not sure of the source, but I read someone that if used with respect, it is actually safer than Advil and a lot of other prescription drugs. When I took it, it felt so natural.
