				Get it down as fast as possible without throwing up is how most people do it, but exactly how fast can you chew on hard cactus.

				Good morning folks.<br />That was FUN.<br />It does kind of look like a boob, lol.<br />I can&#039;t really tell you what it tastes like, I threw in so much lime it was crazy.<br />So it just tasted like margarita, but after each sip was an almost overpowering bitter-taste.&nbsp; I do think the lime helped a lot though... and flashing that shit in the blender like that, the pieces were very small.<br />More stomach upset this morning than I had last night.<br />All in all I would say it was a success, but I&#039;ll have to do like, twice as much next time I think.<br />It doesn&#039;t help that the buttons were a month in the mail, so it&#039;s likely some of their mescaline content was reduced.

				Yes it does, and trying to mask it usually only makes it worse!&nbsp; <br /><br />Just gotta choke it down, I guess it is part of the whole experience.

				I made some San Pedro juice and that was some foul stuff. It was a thick green liquid that tasted like chewed pills. That was tough to choke down. I was surprised how hard it and and how long it lasted.<br /><br />Peyote is even stronger and probably tastes that much worse. It&#039;s your body telling you not to eat it because it&#039;s poisonous.

				you should try eating it like me, raw right after cutting it from the desert, with orange juice, i ate like five of them, big buttons too, it was gross as fuck but it was the biggest trip i&#039;ve had. you can prepare it with chocolate, cinnamon, sugar and milk to make chocopeyote which hides the tastes very well :)

				the best way to consume cactus is to dry it, powder it and stick it in capsules, a tea or raw is just a terrible idea especially if you throw up at a bad taste like i do.
