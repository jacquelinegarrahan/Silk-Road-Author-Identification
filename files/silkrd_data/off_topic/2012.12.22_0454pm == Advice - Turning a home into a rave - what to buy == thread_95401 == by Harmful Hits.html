				I love rolling and tripping and me and some friends are going to turn thier place into a rave and have a get together with some ravers we know:) <br /><br />We will roll and trip often so why not buy whatever we need now and start using it right away!! I already bought some lasers, fog machines, glow sticks, kick ass stereo, just basic stuff. What else is good for tripping and rolling? I want this place to be a really fun place.

				You&#039;re off to a good start. One thing I&#039;d add is get whatever you think people will need/want to be COMFY. <br />-A clean, organized space is always super nice. <br />-Clean couches with blankets for everyone (or at least a good majority of people)<br />-Protein shakes or something similar for comedowns to offer your guests (also helps increase the good vibes) after a long night of dancing, exploring, talking, or whatever else you end up doing. <br />-A chillout room for people not feeling like going crazy with the whole blowing-up raving sessions thing.<br />-One of those star projectors would be super awesome. Any kind of green laser projector things are really cool.<br />-Fog machine?<br />-Blacklights! And if you get blacklights, get highlighters so that you can draw on each other, it looks SO awesome.<br />-I would suggest massage oil in case people are comfortable to trade massages. Only do this if everyone is cool with one another, otherwise some jealousy/unnecessary tension can come up. <br />-Clean bathrooms!<br />-Good intentions (not having any more expectations than spending good time with good people)!<br />-Open communication, encourage your guests to speak their minds whenever they like and that everything they say is important and that you will try to help them out if you can :)<br /><br />Share the love!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />This is an awesome idea Harmful Hits, I wish you the best!

				God wish I was there, I love doing this. <br />Let me explain the set up in the old squat we turned into a rave. <br /><br />Chill out lounge, wall to wall matresses, flourecent blue and green lighting strips and on one wall we had a finger paint wall, where you could finder paint fun stuff with glow in the dark paint. We used huge trippy sheets on the ceiling like hanging down moroccan style, loads of duvets, a bar with juices and snacks and chilled out music. <br /><br />The main room, decks, large speakers, a few sofas around the edges, 2 smoke machines, one smoke bubble machine which is different. roof mounted lasers *green, and strobes. we covered the floor in vinyl squares, black and white so it looked like a chess board and put up trippy looking pictures. <br /><br />love lounge was a quiet place to take your lady, really dimly lit, mattresses and sofas, glow sticks and shpongle playing on repeat. <br /><br />The theme throughout was trippy, my girl was really really good at drawing so she drew most of the art on the walls and ceilings, we blacked out all the windows using blackout blinds and made sure it was comfy and clean. always make sure you have someone going round cleaning up. In every room we had loads of clean water and fun stuff to play with, big brightly coloured pool noodles, baloons, glow sticks, silly putty, etc..

				Bumpy... So glad I found this thread! ( I was not &quot;profiling&quot; a poster on this forum. I wasnt. Promise.)<br /><br />OP: is your project done yet? Any parties yet?<br /><br />Recently got an old camper that we&#039;ve already ripped apart and plan on decking out rave style for music festies :) so far we got black and white tiles for the floor (great minds, Ace), a disco ball, and some blue rope lights. <br /><br />Also, a friend of mine got married recently and for the afterparty they turned a hotel suite into a rave room (they were sure to put wedding guests in all the surrounding rooms) and it lOoked amazing. Candles flickering everywhere and she used beautiful satin fabrics to drape from the ceiling and walls to really give it a luxe feel. The king size bed turned into a huge cuddle puddle.

				Lift any carpets or they&#039;ll get fucked and burnt. Get as many neighbours well warned so they can fuck off for the night (particularly if they have kids,&nbsp; as pissed off parents are very unlikely to back down if u wake their little angels irrespective of how good the tunes are, and then call the cops) or invite them along if u know they&#039;ll be sound. <br /><br />I used to do a lotta stencil graffiti (a la Banksy but nowhere near as good or ballsy location-wise) cos I was shit at freehand graffiti. Spend a few days making stencils and once u prime the walls with white paint and it&#039;s dry,&nbsp; u can get the art on the walls in minutes - the more colours the longer it takes. Use spraypaint for cars as this goes on best in one go at a distance and runs the least. And it looks fucking cracking. Use a coupla Banksy ones as well - they&#039;re copyleft for a reason. <br /><br />Howzabout hanging white/light coloured sheets from walls and ceiling in one room with as many projectors u can get ur hands on - get some trippy visuals as well as movies that may compliment or accentuate one another and tunes that suit that room. Ton of big fuck off cushions and pillows and a hookah for anyone in that room to smoke weed/hash/opium if they need to chill the fuck out or are tripping so hard can&#039;t get it together to see well enough to roll a joint.
