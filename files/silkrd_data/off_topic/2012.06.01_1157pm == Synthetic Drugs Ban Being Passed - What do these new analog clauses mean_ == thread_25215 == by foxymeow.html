				Hello,<br /><br />Looks like they were finally able to get the drugs act though by tacking it on as an amendment to some FDA Regulatory Bill. This time it will actually go through. However, I notice that instead of straight up listing out all of the cathinones it now has the following clauses:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; ``(i) 2-(3-hydroxycyclohexyl)phenol with substitution at the 5-position of the phenolic ring by alkyl or alkenyl, whether or not substituted on the cyclohexyl ring to any extent.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``(ii) 3-(1-naphthoyl)indole or 3-(1-naphthylmethane)indole by substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted on the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthoyl or naphthyl ring to any extent.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``(iii) 3-(1-naphthoyl)pyrrole by substitution at the nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring, whether or not further substituted in the pyrrole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthoyl ring to any extent.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``(iv) 1-(1-naphthylmethylene)indene by substitution of the 3-position of the indene ring, whether or not further substituted in the indene ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the naphthyl ring to any extent.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ``(v) 3-phenylacetylindole or 3-benzoylindole by substitution at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring, whether or not further substituted in the indole ring to any extent, whether or not substituted on the phenyl ring to any extent.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r112:1:./temp/~r112gnOblB:e276640:<br /><br /><br />What exactly do these mean and what chemicals are banned by these clauses?

				It looks to me like they are covering for analogs yet to be popularized. Not entirely sure it&#039;s a little over my head but I&#039;ll ask my chemist friend if he stops by tonight

				what you cut out was the listing of the synthetic cannabinoids, as it states in the line above what you quoted in the bill... below that is where they list all the ketones and psychedelics, which you didnt mention, but is actually the part of the bill you should be concerned with. if it passes, things like the phenethylamines will be specifically outlawed unfortunately as schedule 1. <br /><br />your link doesnt work, so i quoted the actual bill I found which amends the CSA as far as i can tell, unless you were referring to something else<br /><br /><br />A BILL<br /><br />To amend the Controlled Substances Act to place synthetic drugs in Schedule I.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,<br /><br />SECTION 1.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‘(2) In paragraph (1):<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‘(A) The term ‘cannabimimetic agents’ means any substance that is a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) agonist as demonstrated by binding studies and functional assays within any of the following structural classes:<br /><br />&nbsp;

I thought they had replaced those chemicals with analog clauses that covered them or something. I guess I was wrong.<br /><br />So I really don&#039;t understand, is this bill that is supposed to ban bath salts (which is the political wave it is riding) ban everything except bath salts. All the chemicals from the old bill were the chemicals that are sold as bath salts.... In florida most of the cathinones are already illegal.<br /><br />I&#039;m so confused lol.<br />

				2c-h being banned sucks since it is the precursor for pretty much all of the other 2c- drugs. Time for people to stock up on as many kilos of that as possible.

				What it&nbsp; means is they are banning&nbsp; chemicals/drugs that do not even exist today so that one can create a new one out the ones that currently do.<br /><br />In essence if chocolate milk did not exist It would be against the law to add nestle quick to it and sell it as choc milk cause milk is banned so anything related to any chemical make up in milk can never be made.<br /><br />Excuse my poor terminology. Not a chemist.
