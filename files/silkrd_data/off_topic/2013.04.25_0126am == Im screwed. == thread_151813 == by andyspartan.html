				Well just thought I should let the community know. I just got some budin the mail and I didnt buy any. I got a sample from a guy and I guess hesent me two but didmt tell me about the second one. Gosh I got it today and the wrong person decided to look through it. Lets just say shit didnt go well. Kinda pisses me off, and cant message seller. I will not release his&#039; name yet, it was just him being generous but still.. You are commiting a felony sending illicit items in the mail. :( wont be able to smoke for a good bit sadly. Hope the site comes up quick.

				First and foremost, sorry to hear you are in some shit, that really sucks and I feel for you.&nbsp; Who looked through it?&nbsp; Parents?&nbsp; Sounds like you had drugs sent to a place where there was a chance someone else would go through your mail.&nbsp; That is a big no no.&nbsp; Also, you should be directing your anger at the person who committed a federal felony by opening a package that was not addressed to them.&nbsp; If the vendor in question wants to send me two packages full of weed please message me for my details.&nbsp; I will leave you a good review on the forums.&nbsp; :)

				Yeah man, you&#039;re directing your frustration at the wrong person. Whoever opened your pack committed a crime and if your not of age then frankly you shouldn&#039;t be ordering on SR. At least if I was a vendor I wouldn&#039;t risk it. I agree with the others, send me all the free weed you want, I&#039;m the only one who opens my packages.

				Yeah... no. Generosity does not excuse unpredictability, not when this much is on the line. What if it was a dead drop? Timing can be important. A little extra weight in the expected package, different story.<br /><br />Sorry to hear it.

				Honestly the unexpected packages are the best because you know someone made a mistake then, A vendor who is currently taking a break accidently sent me a package to my university ( I stopped getting them sent there) and my RA was like you have a package and I was like I dont think I do (cause I knew I wasnt getting anything in lol) and then he showed me and&nbsp; I saw the address was from cali and I was fuck yea and it turned out to be 2 os of some dank ass green crack hahaha

				&nbsp;:o<br /><br />Honestly, this is bullshit move by the vendor.&nbsp; Let&#039;s say the one package that gets seized by the feds is one accidentally sent by a vendor that you were not expecting.&nbsp; So, there you sit with a dirty house and then boom, the door is kicked in, and the feds are holding this package addressed to you full of contraband.&nbsp; You tell them you didn&#039;t order it and you don&#039;t know what it is, but it doesn&#039;t matter because they search your place and you&#039;re busted.<br /><br />Also, aren&#039;t vendors supposed to delete your shipping information after sending out your parcel?&nbsp; Does this mean some vendor has a text file full of customers addresses sitting on his PC and accidentally copied/pasted the wrong address onto his label?&nbsp; So when this vendor gets busted for being sloppy LE has a list of his clients?<br /><br />This is just unprofessional.&nbsp; If you feel like being nice and sending some free product, at least give the customer a heads up.&nbsp; 15 or 50 years old, don&#039;t send random contraband to customers.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Thank you 57.<br />And first of all my name really is Andy and no, I just liked halo alot. And why the fuck does it matter that im a minor?&nbsp; Im pretty damn sure im really damn intelligent for my age and more responsible than some of you fucks. How many minors do yall know have 6 figures in their bank account? Oh yeah. None.<br /><br />Like 57 said, thats not fucking professional or smart to send something without the person knowing when it is felonly being commited. I use SR because i know i can get the mail first daily but I had no knowledge it was coming so I was out. <br /><br />Jeff what are you doing with your life? I doubt you accomplished much and dont reply saying some bullshit about having a successful life cause otherwise you wouldnt be on here. Im here because its the only place to get legit high quality hash oil.<br />Oh and has SR not been working(i will probably find out after this post)? I havent got on herr in a bit cause i checked SR and it never loaded so i never came here. So anyways it was PrivateReserve. And yes 57 he did not delete my address which is against SR policy. Im not really too mad at him because i know if i did get the package i would have been extra happy.<br /><br />Atleast i know of someones house i can send to tho but fuck it, ima make a grow op and that will decide if i come back or not. Sad that i couldnt get that ounce from PR or more co2 oil from greenoven. And yeah... Im not really in too much shit but still.

I&#039;m on your side though, its not really good business practice on here to be saving addresses after a package is sent. And sending one without giving the person the heads up is also not good business. A word of advice though, no need to brag about the amount of money you make/have.

Believe me when I&#039;m 41 I&#039;ll still be on here buying my fine high grade Indica medicine. And it&#039;s kind of already too late now but using your actual name on here is a big no-no. For your own personal safety you should try to stay as anonymous as possible. I mean people make a big deal out of using pgp to encrypt their address and under NO circumstances do they ever send their name or address in plaintext. And here you are with your name as your username. I&#039;m sure you think it&#039;s not to big a deal but trust me when I say the police don&#039;t care how old you are they&#039;ll do everything they can to fuck you over. They are not your friends. Now they know a kid named Andy was trying to buy an ounce of hash oil from the greenovendoor. It&#039;s your safety but in the future I would try to stay a little safer bro. And I would also discourage your grow op idea. Manufacturing is an extremely serious charge. Stay safe my friend and always use the energy sword.

Sorry you got fucked OP, but you sound like you got a decent head on your shoulders. Don&#039;t let it get you down too much, learn from your mistakes and move onwards. Be glad it wasn&#039;t LE and you aren&#039;t in deeper shit. If you&#039;re starting a grow you will definitely want to give it more thought than you gave your drug ordering operations. These types of things aren&#039;t a game you want to play unless you know how to play it. This isn&#039;t Halo. There is no re-spawn point in life when you get caught with something like that. So tread carefully and think deep before you make such a decision. <br /><br />I can tell you right now that its almost certainly not worth it, but I&#039;ll leave that for you to decide.

				Of course the vendor has his part of responsibility for this, but you chose first place to get delivered illegal stuff at your parents home, this is a risk you chose to take. No one else but you is to be blamed for that

				Yeah, well andy not my real real name. But i aint worries and exactly. Im not really tryna make a big fit out of it, the vender is sorta new but and needs to know. So hopefully this doesnt happen to anyone else. And what if i didnt live with my parents what if it was a roomate who is currently training in law enforcement? Regardless what if it was sent to the house beside me by accident and a DEA agent lives there and someone else opened it and told the agent? You must know when you are going to receive stuff, so any venders that say you cant have the tracking number, fuck em. You just cant be dumb to check it several times on a proxy located outside the country. Oh im not dumb to have it done somewhere sketch, and plus as ling as you knoe the right people you will be totally fine.. Its amazing the technology they have created for growing. Plus its all being turned to hash oil, im more of a concentrate guy and plus I love my omicron. But i will tell PR about it and eith that im done buying from sellers newer than 3 months... Sad i would have loved to get a ounce from him but ima have to look to ogbryan

				I never store any addresses, period.<br /><br />That would obviously be retarded.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even keep my tracking receipts.&nbsp; I scan them, encrypt the scan, shred the receipt, and delete the encrypted copy once the order is finalized.<br /><br />did you order your sample to be shipped by 1st class or priority?&nbsp; Please send me an encrypted copy of the return address I used on SR and I&#039;ll confirm if the package indeed came from me. <br /><br />The only catch is that I have no idea if somebody ordered a 2nd sample after the first one is out of the system.&nbsp; I&#039;m assuming everybody here is honest.&nbsp; I recognized two names of people asking for samples on atlantis that asked for one on here, but that&#039;s it.<br /><br />Again, why the fuck would I want to endanger myself by storing addresses?&nbsp; that&#039;s just reckless.<br />

				Hahaha wow this was an awesome read! Kinda reminds me of what happened to me like 2 weeks ago. The postage decided to change my shipping adress to my dads. He was not very happy about getting half a gram of speed and mdma in his mail.. Though as the mastermind I am I somehow got out of it alive haha. Some people just don&#039;t know how to talk.

				Well its crazy. All ive gotten was a denile and pretty much a response saying im crazy. Thats fucked up, i think i can tell how the og looked and smelled considered i got it like 5 days earlier and it was also packaged the exact same way.&nbsp; Like i said i wasnt tryna make a big deal out of it but I cant even get damn apology?! I could have easily reported him to SR support for keeping my info but its whatever, and id you read this PR, why the fuck would i lie and how would i randomly get the same bud you sent to me as a sample. He just lost my respect, aint saying not to buy from him. He does have high quality bud but just better hope he doesnt keep your address and randomly send you more LOL unless your fine with that. Anyways im done with new/newish sellers its not even worth it to me anymore.
