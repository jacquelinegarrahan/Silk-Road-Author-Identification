				1 - When you see the flashing red and blue lights in your rear view mirror, think you have reached the disco and start dancing in the front seat.<br /><br />2 - When the cop taps on the window, do not yell, &quot;WHO IS IT!?!?&quot;<br /><br />3 - When the policeman says, &quot;Do you know why I pulled you over?&quot;, do not say, &quot;You think I have donuts?&quot;<br /><br />4 - Believe you are playing a real life version of GRAND THEFT AUTO.<br /><br />5 - Begin playing NWA&#039;s &quot;Fuck Tha&#039; Police&quot; on your radio very loudly.

Btw, impressive cover. I usually just have a panic attack when I get pulled over. It&#039;s not pretty.

				A man and wife are driving home one from a party down an old country road. Suddenly, the husband realizes they are near the field where, as teenagers, they would park and make out.<br />&quot;Hey, honey!&quot;, The husband says. &quot;Look over there! It&#039;s Farmer Brown&#039;s field where we used to park when we were teenagers.&quot;<br />&quot;Why, yes it is&quot;, his wife replies.<br />&quot;Wouldn&#039;t it be romantic if we pulled over and fooled around again like when we were young?&quot;, he asks.<br />Well, she&#039;s a middle aged woman who doesn&#039;t get much action these days so she quickly agrees. They pull and over and park and scamper out of the car across the field.<br /><br />The husband grabs his wife and throws her against the fence and begins making love to her. Within moments, she is writhing, moaning, squirming with her eyes rolling back in her head. The husband is pretty impressed with himself.<br /><br />Afterwards, as he&#039;s getting dressed and zipping up, he looks over at his wife and says, &quot;Wow, honey, you never made love like that 20 years ago!&quot;<br /><br />His wife looks at him and replies, &quot;Asshole, 20 years ago the fence wasn&#039;t electrified.&quot;
