				Figured i&#039;d make my own thread like the other guy. Last time I actually tripped was probally around 2002 maybe 2003 but that was from liquid. Last time I ate blotter was 99 I believe it was. So I got 2 hits in today, my first SR purchase. Just ate both hits and they tasted pretty strange, like chemically / bitterly. From what I remember long time ago. I can remember a slight sting like on my tongue when I tripped off the blotter and really no taste that it had. But this stuff. It just tasted pretty weird and strong. Im wondering if it is indeed real lsd or maybe it could be some other thing being passed off as lsd? Like DOC or some other chemical? Not that I wouldnt really mind if&nbsp; it was DOC or something b/c I will still trip, but it would be nice to know b/c I wouldnt have taken both lol. I guess ill know in about 45 if its cid or not. Have a feeling ima be in for one incredible ride.

				The last time I had some there was zero taste whatsoever. Sounds like yours might not be totally legit but I&#039;m no expert.

				Please post sellers info, not to slander if he product worked but a fare warning that it is not pure, pure lsd has no taste, the amount on he paper is to little to ever have a noticeable taste, if its bitter its a spitter

				Hi everyone!<br /><br />These were most likely my Alex Grey blotters he took ;) The bitter taste comes from a fixation spray which is being used on the blotter. I know for a fact that this is 100% LSD-25!<br /><br />-Mitanox<br /><br />PS, killa4204 have a great one and dont forget to post a small review / tripreport ;D

				Hey Mit. I actually got these from zapod which I think were the Ganesh ones I think he said? Is that the same ones you had before the alex greys?<br /><br />So I am still not totally sure if it was cid or something else. The taste at first was the one thing that made me wonder if it was. In about 45 - 1 hour is when the visuals started. It wasnt that bad at first. I was enjoying it. Then after bout maybe hour and half to two hours in when everything started going downhill for me. I have never experienced such a body trip from acid as I did from these things. One thing I noticed is my jaw was so tense the entire time. It is still hurting me this morning. I had everything setup for me to play some music and lay down on my couch and had some visual programs hooked up to my tv. Music did sound pretty trippy but its like I was on some kind of speed or something. I just could not lay down and enjoy it. Felt like my heart was going a million miles a hour which at this point is when it got pretty bad. Im guessing it was about 2 and half hours in when I kept just pacing back and forth in my house wondering what the hell did I just take to make me feel like this. Now ive tripped a bunch of times before. Cid, shrooms even more than that. It was almost like a combination of shrooms and acid. The whole time I was wondering like where is the trippy part that fucks with your mind b/c its like it wasnt there for some reason. I remember when I tripped years ago id always have these crazy thoughts and conversations with myself while tripping and after id always feel like I &quot;learned&quot; something from that experience. Well, the only thing I learned from this experience is that I will NEVER take 2 hits of anything before trying one before. That was pretty dumb and I considered myself a experienced tripper but this time is one of the only times I have ever come so close to just losing my shit... So back to the part where I was pacing my house. Everything was just so much going on at that point I had the bright idea to go lay down and try to relax in my bed. I go lay down. My body is like killing me at this point. All my muscles were so tense and soar im laying in bed just wanting it to end. At this point im prob around the three to 3 1/2 hour point and tell myself that I only have maybe another hour or two before it would be coming down, I hope. The visuals were just so much going on I got up and turned off my light to just laydown and relax. STUPID mistake. Now my room isint no bigger than 12 feet by 10 feet or so with a closet. Im laying down on the bed in the dark and realize, this was mistake. Turn some lights on right now. When I get up off my bed in pitch black, it was like I was in some dungeon or something. I was freaking out at this point. I was so fucked up I couldnt find the dam light switch! I just wanted to get out of that room so bad and I kept opening this door over and over and over it was going no where. Felt like I was going inside a door, inside a door, inside a door etc. Finally what musta been like 10 min in real time but a eternity in my head I found my door and opened it up to my hallway. Wow, biggest sense of relief came over me right there, I was out of the dungeon thank god lol. Come to find out later I kept opening my closet door and thats why I was going no where lol. After getting out every light in the house was turned on, there was no way I was going back to that dark ever again. At this point im guessing maybe about the 4th hour or 4.5 hours into it I went back and turned on my tv and tried to watch tv but I still felt like I was speeding.&nbsp; I couldnt just relax at all. I was so sick b/c of the body trip I musta puked 30 times all over my floor to. Couldnt even make it to the bathroom. But after puking I felt like that was the best thing as it could make it go away some or so I thought. Everything on tv was still sounding like morphing, I kept going through the channels b/c there was nothing I liked. Finally found some kind of cartoon and watched that for about 30 min when all of sudden its like a switch that went off in my head and I then realized I was finally coming down, yaaaa I told myself, its finally going to be over soon haha. The comedown was like another 2 hours it felt like. I tried going to sleep and it didnt work. I may have slept about 2 hours total b/c i&#039;d wake up like every 30 min till I just got up a little while ago. So after everything and looking back. I really am not even sure if that was indeed really good acid or something else. It probably is acid I just took way to much. One would have been plenty, maybe even half of one and I coulda enjoyed it. This was the first trip I fought myself the entire time and never got to enjoy it. Next time I get some, I will only be doing half of one hit thats for sure. Sorry for the long ass post but im still kinda out of it today. My body is still soar as hell to.

				Wow, quite a story! Everything you tell me though strikes me as a acid trip with the big exception of the tension on the jaw, I usually only get that of MDMA &amp; amphetamines. Hope this experience hasn&#039;t turned you against LSD ;)

				Zapod chiming in here, I did indeed sell this LSD. I&#039;m sorry this was your experience with it! I&#039;m so sorry for recommending you take both of them!!!!!! When I started reading I was going to say it sounded like maybe you had a high tolerance or the tabs were somehow weak, but it sounds like you tripped much harder than you&#039;d wanted to. <br /><br />About the taste: the Buddha/Ganesh (also called &quot;Alex Gray&quot;s because the Ganesh blotter art is his painting) tabs do indeed have a taste, but this is Not from the drug (it&#039;s too small an amount, exactly like LucyLover said), it is indeed from however the actual paper was made. I took 8 with my friends last saturday (who each took two, eight was ridiculous), and for about 20 minutes I did in fact feel like I had stuck some pine in my mouth- it was very hard to resist drinking any water while waiting for it to absorb haha. The ganesh/buddhas are REALLY well known, and they have ALWAYS tasted like this- there were some posts on the old forums about people before I ever made it onto SR who were asking the same questions about why it tasted like that. I can guarantee it&#039;s nothing but pure LSD, especially with all of the other people on SR and every other forum that exists selling it too :)&nbsp; It&#039;s also my understanding (and I could be wrong on this) that DOC blotter tends to be thicker due to the mg instead of ug required? So while the blotter DOES have a taste- LucyLover is jumping the gun here as it is from the paper, NOT the substance :)<br /><br />These are much stronger than the average tab one would find in the US, I hope this hasn&#039;t turned you off to LSD!

				At the time I was trippin I was telling myself. No way. Im to old for this, this will be last time. But&nbsp; now that im normal again. One scare hasn&#039;t turned me off, but has made me humble about how much power is really in those thats for sure. Cid was the first drug I ever did, followed by herb next so it will always hold a special place in my heart. I guess maybe back then we just had some really weak acid or something lol. But even one back then i&#039;d trip pretty hard for a good 5-8 hours but I was always able to control myself instead of fighting to stay sane like this time haha.&nbsp; I was just guessing kinda like the X we use to get back then. One pill would have you rolling all night compared to nowadays, you have to eat 3-5 just to feel like it was one pill. I thought the cid woulda been the same thing but dam was I wrong haha. What is the minimum amount anyone has taken a gotten a good trip? If that one was 100ug each and I took both. I am still kinda wondering if next time I should just take half which would be 50ug. Would that even be enough to trip? Maybe if I take 3/4 that would be better. I just checked out erowid and it says 50 -150ug is a common trip. 150 - 400 is strong trip. That def would be a strong trip in my book lol.

				was it a hairspray like taste? <br /><br />sounds like&nbsp; you had a bad trip because you let some anxiety and paranoia of a strange tasting lsd blotter lead to possibly the fact it may not be lsd, omg im to old to be doing this shit /head explode <br /><br />you&#039;re next trip will be great.

				Nah, not really like hairspray, even though I havent tasted hairspray I can say lol. But ya, I think me thinking about what did I take, did I take to much, wasnt that good to be thinking the whole time.
