				I need some advice on my predicament. So basically, I need to get some motherfucking pills on a motherfucking plane. I&#039;m not trying to pull some grandiose drug smuggling job or anything. Unfortunately, I have to attend a business trip to the Dominican Republic in a few months with some of the corporate cocksuckers I work with. I want to bring at least three or four&nbsp; 30mg IR oxys aka blues and maybe one or two Xanax with me on my trip so i can get a little fucked up while I&#039;m there. Also, id be flying out of a airport in the US to the Dominican Republic. <br /><br />Any advice on getting these pills through the security checkpoint?&nbsp; <br /><br />Ive gotten narcotic pills through security before but this was when there was just a metal detector to walk through and maybe a brief pat down.&nbsp; Now they have these goddamn body scanners, chemical detection devices, and those rape rooms in the back where they take people who they deem &quot;suspicious&quot;. Not to mention those TSA people can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. I know they&#039;re mostly looking for terrorists but they&#039;re obviously doing a shitty job at that so they probably just concentrating on inconveniencing everyone else. <br /><br />I have no idea of what these body scanners and chemical blowing machines are capable of detecting. <br />Does anyone on here do?<br /><br />One of my friends told me a just toss the pills in my carry on,&nbsp; haphazardly and they wont see them in the x ray. Is that a good idea?<br /><br />Or should I just keep them in my pockets, wallet, or stash them in my sock?<br /><br />Should I go as far as sticking them up my bootyhole? After wrapping them up of course.<br /><br />Or Should I go about getting a fake pill bottle label with my name and the drugs im bringing on it. (Id bring more than 3 or 4 if I did that)<br /><br />Would it be best if i just said fuck it because its too risky. Id be traveling with a couple of my co workers one of them being my boss.<br />They&#039;d probably fire me if i got arrested at the airport. <br /><br />Also, i don&#039;t have they appearance of a junkie anymore since i graduated from college.<br />Id be wearing my usual business suit so id blend in with the other traveling business people at the airport. And if i went through with it I would take a xanax before i went through security so i wouldn&#039;t look nervous. <br />

				Aren&#039;t you allowed to take a personal use amount with you if you are traveling ?<br />Those are legally available.&nbsp; Are you forced to take the prescription with you, everywhere you go ?<br /><br />Don&#039;t know, maybe it would be okay if you have them with the rest of your travel first aid kit even if they saw them ? Worst case i would say that i don&#039;t have the prescription with me ?<br /><br />Greetings<br /><br />

				I seriously doubt you&#039;d get arrested for a few xanax or even oxyies, but why would you want to take that risk? If you want to get fucked up, just head to a seedy club while there and buy some coke. Even the most out of place gringo could probably get a gram for around $20 there. <br /><br />A lot of people take xanax for flying though, so I&#039;d say there&#039;s no risk if you &quot;accidentally&quot; left some in a pill bottle or something. I can&#039;t say for certain about prescription opiates though.

				Thanks for the replies. They were helpful<br /><br />To answer adrenalin80&#039;s question<br />The rule is at the airport to bring prescription medication with you on the plane it must be in a prescription pill bottle with a label and name on it that matches the one on your ID.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you need that actual doctor&#039;s prescription slip too though.<br /><br />Btw, Id love to go to a seedy strip joint which i plan on doing but my Spanish is pretty rusty and i could easily get robbed or arrested if i tried to score some blow down there. The police down there can usually be payed off if you get into trouble. But they want more money and arrested me&nbsp; id be the only gringo in the jail and probably wouldn&#039;t make it out alive. <br /><br />Any thoughts on the body scanners though?&nbsp; <br />Wtf is that deal with that shit?<br />And can the x ray machine see a few small pills in ur bag?<br />
