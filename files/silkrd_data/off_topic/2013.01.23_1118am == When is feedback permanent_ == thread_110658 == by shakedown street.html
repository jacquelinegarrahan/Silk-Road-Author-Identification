				How long can a buyer go in and change their feedback?<br />Seems there should be a time limit.

				There is no time limit, but feedback gets deleted after ~3 months.<br />That&#039;s a good thing, with all this FE, also you could finalize but test the product later and find out it&#039;s not what it should be.<br />

But it is there for some good reasons. <br />If I can suggest something, that I would do if I was a vendor, is explaining the situation when getting a negative feedback on my main page. I ve seen some vendors doing that, it helps a lot when a buyer checks your history, because that&#039;s what I look for, what the negative fb was about, but usually they are not informative so you don&#039;t know what was the problem and how the vendor responded to it. If you think it&#039;s not justified let your customers know what happened.
