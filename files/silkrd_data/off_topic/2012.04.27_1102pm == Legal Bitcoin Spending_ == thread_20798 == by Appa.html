				Does anyone know of any good marketplaces that take BTC for items that are legal (or otherwise useful and relatively safe) to possess?&nbsp; I&#039;ve been trying to do research, but am having a hard time knowing which sites/markets are legitimate.&nbsp; This sort of information could be useful to people with a lot of BTC (like SR vendors) who don&#039;t want to have to go through the trouble and risk of changing all of their coins into cash.&nbsp; They could spend at least some of them on items that they would want to purchase with cash anyway.<br /><br />There are a few SR vendors who are already kind of filling this void, like Only, who sells cigarettes, and TwoToneMan, who sells counterfeit apparel (which I guess isn&#039;t legal, but sure looks real, so who would know?).&nbsp; There is also PriscillaMarie90, who sells pet medications, which almost definitely isn&#039;t legal, but could be an extremely useful source for anyone with pets.<br />I&#039;m sure there are others, but I haven&#039;t come across them yet.&nbsp; If you know of other SR vendors who do things like this, please feel free to list them here as well.

				Coinabul . Purchase gold and silver coins and bullion with your BTC. Probably the safest and simplest way to cash out in large amounts.

				Yeah, I know a few places you can get bullion.&nbsp; It sounds like a good course of action, but I&#039;d be wary of selling it.&nbsp; I know nothing about the bullion market, but I was imagining that finding someone local to deal with (maybe on a gold-enthusiast forum?) might be the best bet.&nbsp; Having the money received from lots of gold sales linked to a bank account seems like a bad idea.&nbsp; Advice on working with bullion is welcome in this thread.

				Some things to note.. the &quot;Goldbug&quot; crowd is often the same as the &quot;NWO/UN/ZionistOvergovernment is coming to take our Freedoms&quot; crowd.<br /><br />If you purchase gold/silver coins or the bullion that is stamped properly (like in units of grams or fractions of an oz troy) you simply head out to&nbsp; local coin shops and gold-purchase outlets. Tell them you want cash for your metal. Put it down on the counter. If they don&#039;t want to give you cash.. walk away.. chances are VERY good they will be saying &quot;hang on sir hang on&quot; before you get out the door.<br /><br />Selling gold/silver for cash is NOT hard.. especially if you are willing to take slightly less than it&#039;s worth. Just remember when you go in.. you are not a druggie.. not a stoner..you are a God-Fearing Believer in the Word of the Lord. And you need to exchange some gold for cash so you can take advantage of an opportunity to buy a collection of firearms from someone elderly who goes to your church.<br /><br />Try it out.. buy a coin or two from coinabul.. then take it to 2-3 local coin shops and ask for a cash offer.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				It seems to me that BTC has been tainted and lots of &quot;legit&quot; companies wont fuck with it. Kinda like the old days when you worked at the mill and they paid you in tokens that were only good at the company store lol.
