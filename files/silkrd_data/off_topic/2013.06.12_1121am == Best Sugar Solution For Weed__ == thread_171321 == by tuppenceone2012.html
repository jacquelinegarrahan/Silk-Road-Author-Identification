				Are you fucking kidding me? Spraying sugar (or almost anything for that matter) on cannabis is a big no-no! The sugar will vaporize while smoking and condense on the lung&#039;s inside surface, which can cause severe irritation that lasts multiple days. It&#039;s also carcinogenic as fuck.<br />Don&#039;t spray your weed!

				There are liquid ferts that you mix with your nutes during the flowing stage to add sugars (Botanicare &quot;Sweet&quot;, among many others) that are supposed to enhance the taste of the final product. Many people add a bit of molasses to their nutes as well. I think if you grow the right stuff, and properly flush at the end, you don&#039;t need those additions. Many will disagree...

				Dont spray your weed when its flowering...<br />The only thing you can do to increase the yield and taste is to use some bloom stimulators..<br />i prever bcuzz or canna..<br />when you want a massive boost on yield, you should use some pk13/14..but dont use it too much, otherwise you&#039;ll get budrot.<br />

				Be careful with saccharide solutions. This promotes rapid growth of unwanted molds and bacteria that can infect the entire plant, from the roots to the trichomes--just like the widespread E. coli outbreaks in spinach, where consumers were unable to effectively wash the affected products.
