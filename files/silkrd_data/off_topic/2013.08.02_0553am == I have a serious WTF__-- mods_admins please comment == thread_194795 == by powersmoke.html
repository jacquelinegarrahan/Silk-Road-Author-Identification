				I logged on today, and found one of my favorite, long term, go-to vendors is missing. Not just missing, but fucking GONE...<br />Not found on the forums, nothing available on the site, just nothing.<br />&nbsp;I have numerous orders from this vendor, as do many many others--and EVERY single one was PERFECT. Additionally, the vendor was extremely knowledgeable about his products, their use, and was always available to offer tips and harm prevention assistance.<br />&nbsp;Further more--i found a old post where someone actually was trying to get some sort of award last year-- &quot;Vendor of the Year&quot; or something, for this vendor....<br /><br />Knowing all of this, i am truly disturbed, and more than a little worried by this sudden disappearance.&nbsp; And I do mean SUDDEN --as in, i looked at his listing last night, to purchase today.<br />So, I got a major case of the What the Fucks....<br /><br />I witnessed two separate and unrelated events this week on the forums, caused by a bullshit customer, that ended with well respected and liked vendors suddenly losing their account and privileges. I&#039;m speaking specifically of the situations of both FiveStar and BruceCampbell.<br />Had these events not taken place on the forum, in full view, its very possible that no one would have ever know what happened to these vendors--other than they were gone the next day.<br /><br />So my point is, to anyone and everyone---<br />Where the hell is Hatter26??? <br />What the hell happened?&nbsp; <br />What would cause a vendor with ZERO complaints, a vendor that is well respected by vendors and buyers alike, and someone a lot of vendors could learn a thing or two about service from,&nbsp; to disappear OVERNIGHT???<br />I think most of his customers know he has a habit of going into stealth frequently, to catch up on orders, or if there is an issue with the site, or things like that. <br />As far as i can tell, this aint the case today. <br />He&#039;s simply GONE.<br />WHY???&nbsp;

				I haven&#039;t actually heard of that vendor before, but usually if they&#039;re gone it is due to one of two possibilities:<br /><br />1) they were caught breaking a rule and were demoted - in which case going to their vendor profile would take you to a message composition page, or<br />2) they requested that their account be deleted.<br /><br />Also, just checked on the forum and there really hasn&#039;t been any mention of that vendor recently.&nbsp; His forum account has also been deleted, but his posts have not, which implies that he deleted his own forum account.<br /><br />

				This sucks - I decide to come back to the road today and seems my go-to vendor left yesterday =-/<br /><br />He had been going in and out of stealth, but now he&#039;s just toast...&nbsp; Hopefully he&#039;s ok.&nbsp; I seriously will miss this guy.<br /><br />His cold-shoot was great for harm reduction.&nbsp; You don&#039;t see anything even close from any other vendors.

I was surprised when the package was delivered the next day--on a Saturday. <br />When i opened the package up though, i was PISSED.&nbsp; I just knew i had been scammed. Best i could tell, there was nothing in the envelope.<br />&nbsp;I sent him several pm&#039;s in rapid succession, wanting to know what the hell was going on, and where was my order. Since it was a Saturday i didnt expect much.<br />He responded quickly-- first with an apology for causing me to be upset, and then with a couple of hints where to find my order--I was immediately both impressed and embarrassed.<br />&nbsp;Hell, his shit looked like it came straight out of a damn LABORATORY. What he sent was sterile, clean, well package, filtered in some cases..on and on and on.<br /><br />When i considered the previous orders i had gotten from other vendors, and what they were using as &quot;stealth&quot;, I had to laugh out loud..<br />Since then, i have 50-60 orders that have been delivered, and not a single one used the type of stealth that Hatter used.<br />&nbsp;Thats too bad, considering the buyer is potentially the one most affected by holes in the shipping.<br /><br />Sorry if comes off like i&#039;m a Hatter fan-boy, cause&nbsp; I dont feel thats really the case. I order from plenty of his competitors. <br />And i didnt intend for this to turn into a dick sucking party for Hatter, either.<br />&nbsp;I just know that he went through a whole lot of damn trouble to make sure his customers were protected. And we cant stand to loose vendors like that.<br />
