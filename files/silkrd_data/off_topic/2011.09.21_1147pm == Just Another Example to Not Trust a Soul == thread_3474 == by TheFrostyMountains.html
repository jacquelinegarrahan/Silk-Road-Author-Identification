				Well, needless to say, I fucked up... But maybe not? At least in this case I had the privilage of recognizing a thief before anything big happend ! He doesn&#039;t know that I know ! I&#039;m just pretending that<br />everything is OK and that I am oblivious ..&nbsp; It cost me $20 when I left the room to go and get my cigarettes to find out he is a thief so I think I bought this guy cheap. I know it was only $20, but I have<br />fantasies of killing him now. We never hung out much, but he moved a pound of weed for me a couple years ago. I think he might be into the hard drugs now... Is there any way to kill this guy without getting caught ?<br />Please , I need some ideas ! <br /><br />TFM

				Your message is very strange...<br />I think it&#039;s the price to pay for anonymity, you get all kinds of people saying funky things....<br />You do seem genuinely pissed though, hence the fuzzy writing.<br /><br />You did talk about &quot;soul&quot;... are you willing to lose yours for 20$?<br /><br />Just forget about it, next time just trust your gut and don&#039;t tempt with the devil.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;v always thought I was insane, but people never stop amazing me...

				steady on dude, i know you may be a bit pissed off that someone stole from you but is $20 really worth taking a life for? have you tried confronting him, maybe even punch him in the face if itll make you feel better but $20 is no reason to splatter someones brains over the wall.

				@towlie<br /><br />$900 is a lot of debt to let an addict run up, again im not a dealer so i dont really know about these things but id never &quot;lend&quot; someone drugs over the value of the profit ive made off them already just to cover my own arse. but its a bit late for that now, plus like i say what do i know on that side of things IRL im the kind of placid doormat who would just let it slide unless it was causing me serious financial trouble myself.&nbsp; as for getting your cash back do you know if he actually has any cash or stuff you could take from him, hell id be tempted to kick in his door and take stuff to the value if its there and he isnt willing to co-operate, the alternative is to get a few large threatening friends to first remind him that he owes and needs to pay soon, its usually enough to scare someone into paying if the heavies give you a warning (although again im not familiar with addicts so i dont know if itd work the same)<br /><br />@tryptamine<br /><br />ricin is all well and good but it is still detectable to a point, plus un soaked red kidney beans arent always easy to come by, if you want a very easy to make and disguise poison nicotine is your best bet. take a couple 50g pouches of rolling baccy and some water, bung it in a pan and boil it until it reduces to a thick liquid, in concentrated form like that a small amount is lethal, its also very hard to taste in say strong coffee and if your target happens to be a smoker then its hard to detect what caused the heart attack which killed them as they already have all of the chemicals from cigs in their bloodstream anyway. but please dont do this to anyone, god knows where i pick up this info or why i remember it, there is almost no reason for taking a life ever and if there were i sure wouldnt do it in a sneaky way like poisoning (despite my love of ninjas and their dirty underhanded ways)<br /><br />another way to take down a known drug user would be to say get something like bromo dragonfly, force a load down their throat/spike a drink and theyre just another unfortunate victim of a mislabelled substance or overdose (oh fuck me why do i think of these horrible things!)<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />my bad red kidney beans produce phytohaemagglutinin still a lethal poison but ricin is from castor beans

				@Prof.<br />&nbsp;Well the original debt was over $2k and he did bring it down while he was using. Even when I was I would run into him at the dealer and he&#039;d hand me 100 or something. Then he quit and boom. Gone.<br />It&#039;s not causing me serious financial hardship but it&#039;s the principle of the thing. I actually still believe in a thing called honor and a man&#039;s word is bond that kind of stuff.<br />We&#039;ll see what happens on the 4th.&nbsp; I may have to check in earlier to check for a moving truck or something.<br />Believe me when I say I would have kicked the door in a long time ago if there wasn&#039;t the issue of a 100lb pit bull on the other side.<br />I&#039;m pretty sure he has money as he a plush job at a very exclusive country club.<br />Oh well see what happens.

				hey man, just chill out.. i think most of us involved in the drug scene have been ripped off at one time or another.

				Truths I&#039;ve learned:<br />1) Never loan money to friends... it just brings about bad blood.<br />If they need the money bad enough and you have it to spare, give it, but never loan.<br /><br />2) Be honest and forthwith in all your dealings. A secret will come to light some day, and a broken trust may never heal.<br />You break your promise, you cheat, you lie, you steal... others will hear of it, and you will never find a place.<br /><br />3) Worry less. Nothing is so great that you should make yourself suffer over anything. The universe is cruel enough without adding to our own burdens.<br /><br />Forget about the 20, tells everyone who knows this guy that hes a thief. Give him no safe harbor to turn to and let him suffer the life he has made for himself. There is no greater curse and death is an easy escape.

				Im in towelles position, I was ripped off for about 850, actually it was 920, but whos counting, lol.. Im still doing my best to go after the scammer, but with the internet, its so damned easy to hide and very difficult to find them if they do it right. luckily, the guy who ripped me off made some stupid mistakes, like emailing me from his regular email account and yahoo was generous to give me his ip address when i supplied the police report.. <br /><br />So, there is hope, but for 20 bucks, It just sucks, Id hate to see what you would do if you lost 1k... <br /><br />For me, while money is a huge issue, its the getting screwed part that gets me more than losing the money. its putting the trust into someone, not so much the money, while the money is damned important, its number 2 on my list... But boy, does it suck to get ripped off. All you can do is learn from your mistakes, try to not do them again and move on..
