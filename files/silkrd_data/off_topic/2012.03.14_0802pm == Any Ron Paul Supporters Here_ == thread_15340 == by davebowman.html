				First off, I am Canadian, but Ron Paul has been my hero since I was in high school. I am curious if there is a libertarian presence at SR as this seems the sort of place for us to congregate. <br /><br />Furthermore, I think Bitcoin is one of the coolest things ever. The entire silk road system seems indicative to me of the efficacy of true free markets. Silk road is a black market that by its very nature prevents forcefulness, offers fair competition, and discourages fraud via reputation and escrow. This is the closest thing to a truly laissez faire free market I have encountered first hand in my life. It makes me really happy.

				I wish he would of gotten president but he&#039;s basically out...<br />He&#039;d be 50 trillion times better than Romney or Santorum.<br />With Paul we&#039;d be working on getting better, with Romney or Santorum other countries will have more bias on how everyone in America is like Bush.<br />Honestly I REALLY don&#039;t blame them for that, I&#039;d think it too anymore...

				Ron Paul all the way! Even if you don&#039;t like his ideas I don&#039;t see how anyone can claim he&#039;s any worse than obama or romney. At least he has a passion which is something every politician completely lacks in this day and age.

				I&#039;m not american but I 100% support Ron Paul.<br /><br />Not very hopeful. At the end, GOP will go with a stupid dirigiste, exactly the same as 2008, 2004, 2002.

				Watch how quickly the republican nominee is going to become a moderate when it&#039;s time for elections. At least Ron Paul seems sincere, even if I don&#039;t agree with him a lot of the time.

				I think every candidate is certainly far from perfect but I definitely support Ron Paul over anyone else! Kinda disappointing to see how doomed this election will turn out. I was originally an obama supporter but am not happy with the past few years... doesnt seem like there is any hope without Ron Paul now

				You&#039;re preaching to the choir on SR. His drug policy is the dream of most people&#039;s here.<br />His drug and war policies (legalise and pull out) are fantastic. The rest are terrible for the country and world as a whole with the USA as leader of the free world. He&#039;s not going to win anyway so I wouldn&#039;t worry about it too much.

				I kinda like Ron Paul too but ultimately he represent a different side of statism&#039;s ugly head and different ideas of how the state should spend its ill gotten gains.

				Ron Paul has been the most consistent candidate regarding views, the other chaps just change their opinion depending on the situation.&nbsp; Presidential elections are a joke either way, USA is doomed from the start.
