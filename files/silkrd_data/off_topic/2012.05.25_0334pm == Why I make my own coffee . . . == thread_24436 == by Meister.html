				The Straits Times, an English-language newspaper in Singapore, is reporting that a 24-year-old maid there has been charged with putting her menstrual blood in her boss’s coffee. The crime reportedly took place last August at his apartment in Choa Chu Kang, a town in west Singapore, according to Channel News Asia, an English language news outlet based in Singapore. <br /><br />The maid, who goes by the name Jumiah, had been an employee of the 38-year-old man for approximately one year, Asia One reports. While it may seem off-putting to many, the use of menstrual blood is common in folk magic in some cultures, according to Catherine Yronwode, co-owner of Lucky Mojo Curio Company and the author of “Hoodoo Herb and Root Magic: A Materia Magica of African-American Conjure.” Yronwode said that the practice is found in the folklore of many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cultures. <br /><br />An online forum on Lucky Mojo called “Menstrual Blood Questions and Answers” has nearly 500 posts, many of them discussing how to use menstrual blood in food and drink. “It can be used to seduce and enforce fidelity,” she told The Huffington Post by phone. “It’s not exactly a coercive spell. This is kind of like pheromones.” Yronwode was, however, surprised to hear that a maid would use a “spell” like this on her boss. “This is not something you’d do to get a raise on a job,” Yronwode added. “This is something you’d do to get a sexual connection.”

				Wow, that&#039;s disgusting. I always make my own coffee as well (drinking a cup now). I don&#039;t know what she was thinking, maybe she wanted a romantic relationship with her boss? I think there are better ways she could have went about doing it though, lol.

				Yeah, I think it&#039;s safe to say that blood is at the VERY bottom rung of coffee additives. Nothing could be more disgusting than that, lol

				oh come on, who hasn&#039;t pulled a girl&#039;s tampon out with their teeth and earned their red wings?&nbsp; be honest now.<br /><br />i didn&#039;t actually pull the tampon out, but i went down, tasted it, came back up for a shag, then she finished me off with a bj.&nbsp; and said &quot;i just started my period, i taste it on your cock&quot;&nbsp; i said &quot;yeah, i know.&nbsp; i tasted it too, that&#039;s why i didn&#039;t stay down there any longer.&quot;<br /><br />then we went for another shag in the shower.&nbsp; it&#039;s not really that big a deal.
