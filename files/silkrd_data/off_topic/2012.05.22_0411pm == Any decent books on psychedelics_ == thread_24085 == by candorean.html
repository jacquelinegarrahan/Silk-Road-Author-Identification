				I picked up &quot;Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of LSD&quot; but it really feels like the authors have no idea what they&#039;re talking about. Most of the theories and info seemed exaggerated and sensationalistic and I couldn&#039;t take it seriously. I also heard Shulgin&#039;s Pihkal and Tihkal are just fictional stories as well. Each book I read before made me think how unique everybody&#039;s trips were... but reading the SR forums has changed my mind a little. The trip reports here are much more like what I experience and I&#039;m guessing its because nobody here tries to exaggerate. Are there any good, accurate autobiographies that I can pick up on psychedelics?

				You should probably read PiHKAL and TiHKAL first. Also, what interests you most in psychedelics? The pharmacology, the chemistry or the experiences themselves?

				TiHKAL and PiHKAL are half memoir/vignettes/anecdotes, and half discussion about the chemistry/effects of drugs. They&#039;re very interesting but more specialized, and you need to know the language of organic chemistry to understand the second half. <br /><br />Food of the Gods is very good, as is this book, which I&#039;ve been posting here a lot:<br />leftinthedark.org.uk/sites/default/files/Left in the Dark free edition.pdf<br />Not entirely about psychedelics, but more interesting than any other book I&#039;ve read on the subject.

				I agree that Shulgin&#039;s Pikhal, etc. are good reference books for the chemistry and the history, but trod only lightly on the experience(s) - giving a more &#039;objective&#039; point of view. In forty years of taking psychedelics, the one book that I can relate the most to is Leary, Alpert (Ram Dass) and Metzner&#039;s &quot;The Psychedelic Experience&quot; based on the Tibetian Book of the Dead. I dont get into the Eastern religious aspect that (at the time - written in the 60&#039;s) was all the rage, but the various stages (or Bardos) are dead spot on, and you&#039;ll need a good strong dose to take you up to where you can recognize the &#039;points of departure&#039; that differentiate a &quot;thinking/feeling experience&quot; from a true out-of-this-universe psychedelic experience. When you&#039;re &quot;out there&quot; even the most experienced psychonauts can get confused, and parts of this book can really help put that in perspective and help u avoid the &quot;bummer.&quot;

				Best psych book ever:&nbsp; Storming Heaven:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=storming%20heaven&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CGQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stormingheaven.com%2F&amp;ei=H0e8T7n2C6-S0QXxucwU&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqhZiZavQDqm70lqqFqjf546qa2A&amp;cad=rja<br /><br />TiHKaL and PiHKaL are not BS, they are actually pretty decent and mostly spot on.&nbsp; They are also constantly being revised.

				Yeah, you don&#039;t have to be a chemist to enjoy the trip reports, dosage vs effects and some of the basic chemistry elements regarding what you start with and end up with.&nbsp; Those two Shulgin books have helped many an SR buyer shun the BS vendors that show up from time to time.<br /><br />AD
