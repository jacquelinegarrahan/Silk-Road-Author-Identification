				Would like to join a private site such as silkroad, but a bit more private. Although silk road is pretty awesome :)&nbsp; Would trade goodies for referral even tho i know it really doesn&#039;t work through such ways might as well post, and speak my mind.

				Noob or cop, either way people dont have time for this kind of stuff.&nbsp; If a person is a member of a reputable site and is a respectable member they arent going to send you an invite and asking to buy one is a great way to ensure you wont get in.&nbsp; These sites you speak of dont exist, it is just like the first rule.
