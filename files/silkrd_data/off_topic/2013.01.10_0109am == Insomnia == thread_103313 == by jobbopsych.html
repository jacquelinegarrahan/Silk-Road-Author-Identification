				What really helps me fall asleep is reading while laying in bed with only my lamp that sits on my nightstand on. Never take your laptop into the bed with you, whenever I do this I end up staying up all night reading on the computer, except the bright screen makes it so I stay awake.<br /><br />Another thing you can try is spending an hour a day working out, whether you go to the gym or just go for a jog around the block it should help. I work out Monday through Friday every week. If you are not on a schedule then get on one. I find when I am on vacation it is hard for me to sleep because I stay up late and sleep in. As long as I am on schedule, in bed by 10PM and awake at 430AM, it makes it easier for me to fall asleep when it is time.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Greenturtle

				i had insomnia for many years. weed helped me immensely, but aside from that i&#039;d highly recommend buying some jarrow formulas sleep optimizer, which can be found on the clearnet. it&#039;s a combination of gaba, hops flower, valerian, melatonin and tryptophan. the ingredients synergize nicely, making it much more effective than a single sleep aide. it worked wonders for me when nothing else did. i&#039;m sure it will help you too. :D

				If you don&#039;t mind taking pills, melatonin works wonders for me. Even better, you can buy melatonin just about anywhere, and you body naturally produces melatonin as well. Also, have you ever heard of Zzzquil. Well there are many over the counter allergy medications that have the same active ingredients as Zzzquil; diphenhydramine. <br /><br />Pills that usually have diphenhydramine in them usually have 25mg of diphenhydramine. The usual &quot;cup measure thing&quot; of Zzzquil has 100mg of diphenhydramine. So between 3-6 pills usually knockes me out within the hour.<br /><br />Hope this helps; Insomnia is a bitch.
