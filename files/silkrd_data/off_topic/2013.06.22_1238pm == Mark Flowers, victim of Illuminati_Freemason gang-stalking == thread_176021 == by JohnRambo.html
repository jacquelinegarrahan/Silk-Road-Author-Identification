				1. Mark Flowers is a true dedicated Christian but a non denominational and non church going Christian, a praying man upon his knees and he gives all credit to his survival to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as his savoir and protector of him and his loved ones. Mark has to continually break all curses in Jesus Christ’s name, sent by witch craft and the Satanic agenda.<br /><br />2. Mark Flowers is a fighter, a man that will never bow to any evil corruption, to DEATH.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Mark Flowers has had the fatherhood of his children stolen by the masons / system / The Australian Government.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Mark Flowers is a survivor of more than a decade of intense murderous Freemasonry Gang Stalking {a term he coined} and raised in the Federal Magistrates Court Parramatter Sydney Australia in 2009 &amp; 2010 whilst defending his rights to father his children.<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Mark Flowers has had so many attempts on his life in the process of Freemasonry gangstalking that they are too numerous to list, most have been whilst driving in road traffic accident setups by gangstalkers . But all manner of threats have come against Mark Flowers, One time a sour mason wielding a hammer at Mark’s head got a lesson in respect and kicked off Mark’s property. The police always fail to follow such death threats against Mark Flowers.<br />&nbsp;<br />6. Mark Flowers has self-represented in some 60 appearances in the Federal Magistrates Court, the District Court and the Supreme Court in Australia and all with nil formal education, in fact Mark left school at 14 years and first job was in a lumber yard.<br />&nbsp;<br />7. Mark Flowers is a Father first, and a former children’s safety film producer, but the dogs of gangstalking were released on him for doing so. Mark has been fighting ever since and will never give in, as the eternity in spirit and fear of God through Christ Jesus motivates him to be fearless against evil.<br />&nbsp;<br />If I fall in this good fight it will be into the arms of my saviour Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Brother Mark <br /><br />http://www.markflowers.org/

				Has anyone read his site? He is getting stalked by Freemasons because he dared to speak out against their corrupt system. Most judges and some lawyers are Freemasons, in case you didn&#039;t know.

				Why him?&nbsp; Any idea how many sites there are and youtube videos that talk about the illuminati and all of it?&nbsp; If its super secret why would they risk exposure chasing after some guy?&nbsp; If the powerful people are after him you&#039;d think they&#039;d hire a pro instead of going to his house with a hammer.

				Iv seen so many people claim they are bein Gang Stalked and that the Illuminati or Freemasons are behind it. Or eaither they were a MK Ultra canidate an broke free an knew to much so the CIA was out to kill them. <br /><br />If the Freemasons wanted to use their power to Kill someone the guy would be dead. It sounds Like Mark is a Nutcase an is putting all his problems in life off an blaming it on the SUPPOSED EVIL Freemasons! <br /><br />My Grandfather was a freemason an iv grown up knowing Good men who are members as well. Its always the Lunatics an Conspiracy theory nuts that claim all that shit.<br /><br />Whats your reason for posting this anyway? Hoping to recruit ppl so you can get them to some how fund the website and story they/you have come here with?

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yeah ok, its a big conspiracy to get him cuz he spoke out against them.&nbsp; Any idea how many people speak out and go public with it?&nbsp; Are they all being conspired against?&nbsp; Its easy to blame someone or something &#039;out there&#039; as the cause of one&#039;s problems, that way you don&#039;t have to take personal responsibility for your own life.&nbsp; That way, when trouble arises, its all those bad people that are doing this to me and since they&#039;re so powerful they choose to chase me down with a hammer and try to knock me in the head,(ok)LOL

The fact that you think for a second that the masons themselves would stand over him with a hammer is bullshit. The guy sounds paranoid and deluded. Maybe somebody just wanted to kill him to make him shut the fuck up because they were tired of his pointless and unfounded conspiricy theories and when that happened, He decided that it was the masons as well that decided to kill him. <br /><br />Shut the actual fuck up, Jews and masons? Now we know where you really stand, You are either 16 or a stupid ignorant cunt. <br />The US Government has been attacking and killing those who speak out against them, So have plenty of other people, The masons are a lot smarter than you give them credit for. about 100 leagues ahead of you, maybe even 1000.<br /><br />I wish i had never commented on this thread and wish other people would let it die as i keep getting updates in my show replies to my posts and it is annoying as fuck seeing such a shitty topic appearing constantly. <br />JohnRambo, You are the worst type of person that uses Sr, just abandon your account and go and throw yourself off a bridge. Grow up and get a life if you decide not to. <br />What a load of bullshit, Your probably going to accuse me of being a mason now knowing you. Fuck off. seriously.
