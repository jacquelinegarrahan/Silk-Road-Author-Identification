				Can anyone tell me why my post titled &quot;Information Markets&quot; was deleted?&nbsp; Even if you didn&#039;t read/see it or know explicitly why it was deleted, do any of you know why posts may be deleted in general?&nbsp; Are there posting rules here?<br /><br />The main reason I ask, is that it took me a bit to write, and I don&#039;t want to spend another 10 minutes to write and repost if it will be deleted again.<br /><br /><br />Thanks!

				I was talking about starting up an active &quot;Information Market&quot; where anybody with access to *any* type of information that they think could have or create value would sell that to buyers (or sell to a market maker who would buy info from sellers, and then resell it for buyers who may come along at a later time).<br /><br />Information can literally be anything that creates value.&nbsp; Some examples would be:<br />- Commissioned market research reports <br />- Corporate Supply chain disruption information<br />- Pre-release corporate financial reports<br />- Pre-release government economic reports (like bureau of labor stats report, or report on Brazilian GDP)<br />- Anything that documents government corruption<br />- Technical engineering reports for new products or groundbreaking new technology<br />- Anything that would be considered &quot;breaking news&quot; (either would be news very soon on its own, or would be instantly news should one make it public)<br /><br />etc. etc.<br /><br />Many different types of information can have value.&nbsp; I probably haven&#039;t even though of the types of information that would be the most valueable.&nbsp; The point is, that if an active market is developed for trading information, then more and more types of info will become available, because everyone will start to think about how they can extract value from the information they do have access to.

				threads here get deleted all the time, they probably thought it would be bad for PR, those threads get locked or in some cases disappeared pretty quickly. So far you are at least certainly not allowed to talk about overthrowing the government or what the age of consent should be, but those are only two examples that come to mind.

				What I suggest the OP does is maybe message DigitalAlch and check if there was an issue with what ya were discussing. The Mods all have to base this stuff on their own judgement so what one might ban another might not.
