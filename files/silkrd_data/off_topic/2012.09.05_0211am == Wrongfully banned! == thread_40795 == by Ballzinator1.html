				Okay people, I&#039;ll wait another 24 hours in case someone wants to suggest what to do with the money. Preferably donating it to something Tor- or legalization-related. If I have received no good suggestions after 24 hours, I will simply cash the coins out and donate the money to the GHA (German Hemp Association; http://hanfverband.de/index.php/sitemap/1289-german-hemp-association-welcome-page).<br />They&#039;re a professional lobby for the german hemp industry and private supporters of marijuana legalization.<br />http://hanfverband.de/download/verband/dhv_lobby_for_hemp.pdf (Warning - PDF. Might theoretically contain malicious code.)

Why do you complain about a bunch of small errors the mods have done? We can only imagine how many hours of work they put into this platform. If you have a problem with how this FREE forum is run, you can simply stop using it. You haven&#039;t lost anything. That&#039;s the awesome part about free stuff.<br />Maybe it wasn&#039;t even an error on the mods&#039; part. Maybe they have a good reason. Either way, I don&#039;t give a fuck and your post is completely out of place. If you want to address this problem openly, make a new thread.
