				Well i guess everyone&#039;s different but im trying to get an idea what everybody else thinks so i can try a few out with her indoors..I know a lot of people will say MDMA but i always find im rolling to hard and only get horny on the comedown,i keep reading about 2-cb but never tried it? Coke is another but the quality of most street coke is so shit in the UK it&#039;s just not worth bothering.<br />&nbsp;I remember taking a small amount of speed and a few tokes on a Joint at a concert once which had a top effect but maybe that was more of the surroundings than the drugs, a medium dose of mushrooms was also pretty special.<br />&nbsp;What does anyone think? In particular different one&#039;s for male and female because i saw someone selling a vial of oxymorphone?? or something which was supposed to work wonders for women,sort of the female viagra.<br />&nbsp;Like i said weed always works good but i don&#039;t like the strong stuff so don&#039;t know what to get?

				For the boy, I&#039;d say pretty much anything that&#039;s not too overwhelming, like cannabis or alcohol... cause you might get horny &amp; etc, but getting it up can be issues, I&#039;v found, with any &quot;stronger&quot; stuff like ecstasy or coke...<br />For girls, so long you have some lube, anything :P Cannabis usually makes them even more sensual... and what&#039;s more sexy than a girl beneath you with half-open eyes and a skanky smile?

				Personally my best was coming up on strawberry blotter tab and insuffalating a few bumps of mdma and a viagra at a 3 day rave 2003 or 04 in a tent.. gf was on a large gelcap of mdma orally.. basically felt like a 15 min orgasm until I actually did orgasm which was like an on-switch for the peak of both substances, gf swears it was the best she&#039;s had to this very day.<br />I think a large part of my enjoyment was how radiant and goddess-like she looked after the tab kicked in haha.<br />

				I totally second MDMA + a little light weed + viagra....<br /><br />Get crystals and dose yourself on the low end so you don&#039;t get too twitchy. Also, try watching porn on that with her haha. Use some women-friendly stuff if need be. Trust, that not being able to focus thing? Gone in a second lol...

				Interestingly I get coke dick if I take too much cocaine and try to masturbate.&nbsp; Put me in bed with my gf and he&#039;s an obedient little soldier who rises to attention when required.&nbsp; I must say though your orgasm on coke can last up to 5 mins which is pretty cool.

				LSD with a little mdmd or speed. The mdma or speed keeps the interest going for a long time. LSD alone makes you interested but then very uninterested very quickly. The girl prefers mdma and some wind and of course lots of lube. We are talking 6-8 hour sessions here.<br />Don&#039;t forget the Ciallis. It really is better than the Viagra. Allows you to get it up on demand for almost 2 days.

				LSD.&nbsp; Even if you don&#039;t want a full on trip, just half a hit or even a little less makes an incredible sex enhancer.<br /><br />2c-b is amazing too

				Haven&#039;t had sex on drugs other than on while cannabis. mdma&amp;2c-b is nice for masturbating. I think 5-meo-mipt would be awesome..

				a 2cb/e pill and about 3g of mushrooms. 2cb was first used as a aphrodisiac, mixes well with mdma in that aspect. And shrooms just made it fun

				It&#039;s not an illegal drug, but Kanna works for longevity in men. <br /><br />Its basically a natural anti-depressant/SSRI<br /><br />Feels a bit like the comeup of ecstasy.<br /><br />You can take like .5grams orally..<br /><br />or snort like a keybump of the powdered version and effects will kickin in about 3 mins<br /><br />Bouncingbearbotanicals is where I got mine.<br /><br />Beware though.. sometimes makes it really hard to cum

				Im hearing a lot of shouts for 2-CB,hopefully i will have some pretty soon so what&#039;s a good dosage seeing as it&#039;s one of the few things i haven&#039;t tried lol? Actually now i think i haven&#039;t tried ANY of the 2-c range&nbsp; :-[ makes me the saddo who&#039;s losing out doesn&#039;t it.<br />&nbsp;I received some opium recently and while checking up on the best way to use it i saw a lot of people saying how good this was for enhanced sex,mainly males saying it but i am a bloke so bollocks to the girlfriend,she&#039;s horny enough without giving her anything lol.<br />&nbsp;I agree with low doses of LSD,Mushrooms etc,even speed-coke sometimes but the trouble with these is that the tripping or coke might make it hard to...well get hard 8) So maybe some viagra as well,although someone said ciallis is better than Viagra? I thought Ciallis was the herbal stuff?<br />&nbsp;Canabis is great but unfortunately for me i haven&#039;t smoked any for years so just a bit of doobie and im a gibbering wreck on the floor lol,need some weak-mellow stuff,not this super skunk shit,that just glues me to the sofa and makes a few brain cells drop out of my ear (and i can&#039;t really spare any)

				I&#039;ve heard and read a lot mentioning Foxy-Methoxy:<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine<br />is the absolute best.

For me, a tiny bit was OK, but otherwise that&#039;s all I was left with. A tiny bit :P<br /><br />I have this hilarious story that happened to me once...&nbsp; My girlfriend was over and I was mingling on my PC when I got this kinky thoughts overwhelming me all of the sudden... I told her to go put some very sexy clothes, and so she did, a bit puzzled... And I rolled myself this big joint. I then look for some porn film I have, some very naughty dirty kinky double-blowjob with, I think, Sasha gray &amp; Hilary scott.<br />Girlfriend comes back *ALL GUNS BLAZING*!! Bustier-style tank top, stockings &amp; garter belt.. just wow!<br />I hint her to get on her knees below the desk, and she giggles but does it anyway, and I start enjoying, while watching the film &amp; smoking the joint. It was perfect.&nbsp; So I smoke some more and enjoy some more, so I get pretty high. A bit too high, even. My cock went from a new-generation united states nuclear aircraft-carrier flagship.... to a WW2 german sinking U-boat!!!!!!!!!<br />She was the best of them all not to laugh (she couldn&#039;t hide the smile though, but that was OK) at the time, and to have never ever mentioned that again (well she did get the rest of the big joint). But when I think about it, I just can&#039;t help laughing myself :P<br />
