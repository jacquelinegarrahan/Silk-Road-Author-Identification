				so what you are saying is that you expect us to believe that one of your friends that you were buying mad dope off of got popped but didn&#039;t get popped.<br /><br />After law enforcement took all the time and resources to intercept his thousands of dollars of drugs shipments, they didn&#039;t arrest him on the spot.. they just let him hang out in his house because???? they&#039;re just that good of guys???<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe this for one second.<br />You either have to work on your creative writing skills or get your facts straight. LEOs don&#039;t spend all this time, energy and money in order to intercept drug packages and &quot;let the scumbag go&quot;. Who knows, maybe he DID go to jail and he got bailed out. The story becomes a little more credible then.<br /><br />In any case, I would keep ANY drug that I was not legally allowed to own FAR away from my house and stop selling ALL drugs IMMEDIATELY. He might be rich and politically connected but who knows if you would get by so easily.<br /><br /><br />&quot;The world, meaning society protects itself its life and its property<br />but judges, who administer justice and the police<br />the judges are crooked and the police are corrupt<br />and the penal system is degrading, humiliating, subhuman<br />what it means is, it&#039;s not protection they want.. it&#039;s revenge<br />society does not want free men<br />they talk freedom democracy anything you want<br />but they do not want free men<br />society wants conditioned men, men who march in step&quot; -unknown

				Interesting read thanks for sharing man. It&#039;s good to know the risks and what could potentially happen when you order stuff online, so you know what precautions you need to take.<br /><br />Man, I would have been sweating bullets and shitting bricks when I showed up to someone&#039;s place that I was copping bulk shrooms or bulk anything from, and he&#039;s all paranoid saying the DEA just paid him a visit...I would have flushed everything immediately when I got home, that&#039;s how paranoid that would make me. <br /><br />Do you think this guy might have told the DEA about you? If someone told the DEA about me, and I was moving bulk...time to leave the country. Lol.

				I think the guy said he saw news of the guy getting busted in the paper or something? I forget, that would be enough to convince he wasn&#039;t ripping me off though. But then...that doesn&#039;t add up. If the news of the bust was in the paper, why did he find out by going to the guys house? So, maybe he researched it after the fact for confirmation, seems reasonable enough.<br /><br />As for how the surveillance got started, he said the guy would host a ton of raves and was even interviewed by a news team and he claimed to be the driving force behind all of it or something. It&#039;s all up there in his run-on sentences.<br /><br />It&#039;s an awful lot of typing to be a troll, and of no real benefit to him to be lying to us, so I&#039;m inclined to buy the story. Not sure what it gets us, other than an indication that even if you&#039;re a retarded mid-level dealer, if you have the right connections, you still don&#039;t do time.

				Well i sure hope he did rip me off instead of him being popped. Still there is several things that went down that make get the feeling he really did get popped. If he did rip me im not worried i know were he lives and i also know were his parents house is. So i can easily get some muscle to fuck his shit up!

				Yeah he still owes you but give him time to pay back if he needs it cops could have seized his money. I had someone go to jail&nbsp; who owed me a bit and when they got out it wasn&#039;t like they could pay back very quickly since their entire stash and all of their money was seized. <br /><br />Sounds like he snitched to me, which is why I am curious the name of the forum it happened on. Maybe he gave up his accounts for a lighter sentence or something. Plus if he was raided it could very well mean the person he bought off of was a fed or someone else the feds pwnt.
