				I&#039;m getting MDMA powder, is there a simple way that I can rock it up again into crystals?&nbsp; I figure it&#039;s better stored that way since there is less surface contact with air.&nbsp; It also looks much cooler.<br /><br />Is there a way to wash out the impurities?&nbsp; stuff is supposed to be 80% + percent, I&#039;d like to purify it to see the actual potency and be able to perform proper exact dosage<br /><br />Thanks guys

				copy pasted from scribed<br />http://www.scribd.com/doc/69888198/MDMA-Recrystallization<br />Is this a good method? <br /><br />Are the directions accurate? <br />Is there a better or easier method?<br />Quote:Once you have your dry drug hydrochloride salt crystals, sometimes you want to get them more pure, because impurities can be trapped inside the tiny clumps of crystals. A good way of doing this is to recrystallize. The idea behind this is to find a solvent that the crystals are kind of soluble in and kind of not. Alcohols usually work well for this. When talking about solvents and solid materials, hot solvent dissolves more solid than cold solvent, so this can be used to your advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp; Get two containers. Put some alcohol in one and bring it up to boiling. Put your crystals in the other container. <br /><br />Slowly add boiling alcohol to your crystals and they will dissolve. Use just enough alcohol to dissolve all of your crystals.Now since cold alcohol doesn&#039;t dissolve crystals very well, cool down the alcohol/product and the crystals will come back out (recrystallize). The slower you cool the alcohol, the bigger the crystals are. The bigger the crystals are, the fewer impurities will be trapped inside of them, and the purer your product will be. So big crystals = pure crystals (usually). <br /><br />One good way for ensuring that your alcohol cools down nice and slow is to put some water in a pot and heat it to boiling and take it off of the heat.Then put your container with hot alcohol/dissolved crystals in the pot of water being sure not to get any water into the alcohol, cover the container, and let it cool down to room temperature. Then you can put the container with alcohol in the refrigerator to cool more. Then into the freezer to cool more. Then you can filter your pretty crystals out. <br /><br />Now there is usually still a little bit of product left in the alcohol, so if you boil off say 75% of the alcohol and repeat the cooling process you can&nbsp; get some more crystals.There are other ways of changing the solubility of the crystals in the alcohol, such as adding acetone or ether to the alcohol, but the temperature method works quite well, is cheap, and simple. So newbies should use it first, then experiment with other methods if they want to<br /><br />comment on thread<br /><br />Recrystallization of MDMA using IPA/ACETONE<br />• ALL solvents should be Anhydrous<br />• Dissolve product in a minimum quantity of boiling anhydrous Isopropyl Alcohol(IPA)<br />• When all product has gone into solution add 4 times the amount of freezer chilledanhydrous acetone to the solution<br />.• Example: 75ml of IPA dissolves 20-25g of product you will add 300ml of freezerchilled anhydrous acetone<br />.• Seal and put in freezer for 1 ½ to 8 hours• Filter out crystals using a buchner funnel.<br />• Air dry crystals. Low heat source can be used. Macerate crystal to make sure thereis no solvent trapped in crystal latticeNOTE: Acetone is dried using Anhydrous MgSo4. Add 20g MgSO4 per liter of solvent.IPA can be dried using CaO.*** Also Acetonitrile is supposed to be very good at recrystallizing MDMA
