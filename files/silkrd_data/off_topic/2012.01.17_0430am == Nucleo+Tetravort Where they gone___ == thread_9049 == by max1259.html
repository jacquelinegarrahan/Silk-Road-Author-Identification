				Wumg is still active. His products are listed. <br /><br />Tertavort listings are back in the middle of this week, he said. <br /><br />I know that NUCLEO looks from time to time if there are new messages on SR.....<br /><br />Regards <br /><br />Bubble

				some ASSHOLE accused nucleo of lacing his H with fent and causing an OD.&nbsp; THIS IS WHY WE CAN&#039;T HAVE NICE THINGS!!!<br /><br />nevermind the fact that if someone ODs it&#039;s their own damn fault...in addition to the fact that lacing an opiate with a FAR more powerful opiate doesn&#039;t really make much sense unless you&#039;re going to charge a premium for it.&nbsp; from what i remember nucleo&#039;s prices were among the lowest on SR.

				If anyone has Nucleo&#039;s email address (or is in contact with him) could you please PM or email it to me (toryoshi@tormail.net)?&nbsp; I saw an item he was selling that I have been trying to find for over 8 years and the day I got coins the item was gone.&nbsp; I understand if you don&#039;t want to give out his email address, so if you&#039;re not comfortable could you please pass my email (toryoshi@tormail.net) on to him?<br />Thank you so so so very much in advanced!<br /><br />PS I am fairly new to SR, so any advice you could share with me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again!

Kinda the same thing that happened to digitalink, is it not? I got bunk stuff from him, though, so I&#039;m kinda glad he left, whereas I really only heard great things about nucleo...
