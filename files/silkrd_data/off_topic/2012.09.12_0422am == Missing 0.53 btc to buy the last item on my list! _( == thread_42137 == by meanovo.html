Use this experience as a lesson and be sure to get enough to cover your orders in future.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

				3 months ago I would not have had a problem doing this when 1BC = 3.2 odd quid, but times have changed. <br /><br />A good rule of thumb I tend to follow is instead of calculating your SR fund rigorously (messing around with exchange fees, bank fees etc etc) just add on 10% for purchases &lt;100 quid etc, the remainder will always be there when you come back.

				I understand what you mean. But the real mistake was probably buying the Bitcoins before desiding what to buy.
