				They did used too use them in a clinical setting , some still do rarely I think . <br />&nbsp;<br />There are still many advocates for both mdma and l.s.d as as a short term treatment - all 3 of those helped me , but I advise caution with l.s.d - while it can be the most beneficial in some cases - it can go the other way sometimes&nbsp; - also many antidepressants inhibit l.s.d&#039;s effects while others ( trycillics mostly ) can do the opposite . <br /><br />Good to see you sharing your work , I hope it works well for you =)

				good... the CBD has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties.... unlike THC which can cause anxiety.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see what effects CBD has on human pathological anxiety.

				Minor update:<br /><br />This is after going a couple weeks with the benzos and phenibut and working a few of those days.&nbsp; I&#039;m very impressed with how well klonopin (.25mg) &quot;kills&quot; my anxiety at work.&nbsp; I worked with a guy a couple months ago using nothing, and working today on the klonopin was like night and day!&nbsp; I recognized some nervous-producing thoughts, but they were less present, and the thoughts didn&#039;t culminate into almost any anxiety.&nbsp; If I could get something like that daily without building tolerance*... oh my, I would be as happy as many clams (all of them being happy).<br /><br />The valium worked well (the one work day I used it) but at this time I can&#039;t confidently report on how well.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Phenibut I&#039;ve dosed at 1g total (500mg x2) on two days so far while not working and I can&#039;t say I felt any affect from it, so I&#039;m going to up the dose to 1.5g.<br /><br /><br />* Speaking of which, holy crap there&#039;s GABA reuptake inhibitors and one listed as a selective GRI (Tiagabine):<br /><br />Clearnet:&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1435649/<br /><br />Per Tiagabine, example of treatment:<br /><br />&quot;A 32-year-old man with a lifetime history of “shyness” and performance anxiety met the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (Text Revision) criteria for GAD and had a Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score of 21, indicating mild-to-moderate anxiety.The following popper user interface control may not be accessible. Tab to the next button to revert the control to an accessible version.Destroy user interface control[13] The patient was initially treated with buspirone 10 mg 3 times daily for approximately 1 month and experienced increased anxiety, insomnia, restlessness, and mild shortness of breath. When considering optional therapies, he specifically requested a “nonaddictive” antianxiety agent that was not associated with anorgasmia or other sexual side effects. Tiagabine was initiated at 1 mg at bedtime, which resulted in a 3-point drop in the BAI score to 18 within 1 day. After 5 days, the tiagabine dose was increased to 1 mg in the morning and 3 mg at bedtime, resulting in a 14-point drop in his BAI score to 4. At tiagabine 2 mg in the morning and 4 mg at bedtime, the patient reported no symptoms of anxiety and had a normal BAI score of 5. The anxiolytic effect of tiagabine 6 mg/day has been sustained for over 5 months.&quot;<br /><br /><br />-PB

				Update:<br /><br /><br />My SSRI dosage has been upped gradually.&nbsp; I&#039;m currently at 20 mg/day.&nbsp; I think I&#039;m getting a positive effect from it per depression (or from ketamine)*, as in I don&#039;t crash into a downward cycle anymore.&nbsp; Per anxiety I have to say I&#039;m not feeling any reduction due to the SSRI.&nbsp; My psychiatrist has said that most users don&#039;t gain a significant reduction of GAD until they hit 40 mg/day.&nbsp; I&#039;m planning on getting to 40 mg/day as soon as possible to test if the ssri can be a true substitute for a benzo regimen.***<br /><br />*Edit:&nbsp; I&#039;m continuing the micro-dose of ketamine once per week, and my reduction in &quot;depression&quot; may also be due to that.<br /><br /><br /><br />Benzos (all reports regard usage during work days)<br /><br />Klonopin has a huge affect on my work days that I use it.&nbsp; The anxiety squelching is almost total, allowing me to think and act clearer, not being overwhelmed by my anxiety.&nbsp; I&#039;m still taking .25 mg / day for 3 days out the week.<br /><br />I&#039;m not impressed with Valium.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure there is some anxiety reduction with it, but it doesn&#039;t seem to work well for me.&nbsp; I dose 10 mg / day.&nbsp; Maybe I&#039;m dosing too high?&nbsp; I&#039;ll try it at 5 mg at the middle of my work day and see what happens.<br /><br />Phenibut dosing at 1g / day (500mg x2) had no noticeable effect.&nbsp; I upped the dose to 1.8 g / day and didn&#039;t feel anxiety reduction, yet I was more talkative and displayed a more positive attitude towards the end of the day- as if I was drunk without stumbling around.&nbsp; I&#039;ll keep trying this dose to get a confident feel for how it affects me.&nbsp; I may up my dose to 2.5 g / day in the future as a test.<br /><br /><br /><br />Per tolerance: <br /><br />Mildly disturbing discovery,<br /><br />I have been dosing Monday to Friday, and using no GABA increasers / system affectors on Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; After about a month of this I went on a week vacation and decided to &quot;go clean&quot; for the entire week.&nbsp; I was off &quot;GABAs&quot; Saturday and Sunday as usual.&nbsp; Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I felt excessive anxiety, and I know it was from tolerance build-up (after about Wednesday I felt that I had &quot;leveled off&quot;, and though I experienced GAD, I felt it was approximately at my normal level).&nbsp; This was concerning.&nbsp; It showed me that a simple 2 days off per week is not sufficient to come down from a tolerance build-up and that I needed to build into my regimen longer periods of non-usage for GABAs.&nbsp; I plan on going off all GABAs 1 week of every month.&nbsp; I&#039;m willing to bear with the increased anxiety on those weeks, long-term, knowing that it&#039;s part of my regimen.&nbsp; I may also try eliminating my general GABA increasers- Niacin, Thiamine, Vitamin B complex- for long periods to see how that is, and if it significantly decreases tolerance build-up.<br /><br /><br /><br />Overall:&nbsp; I think that these medications are stepping stones-&nbsp; tools to help me change who I am, and I think they are.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think they are the solution, just help to get to the solution.&nbsp; Of course this opinion will only become validated if in the future I&#039;m off of everything and &quot;hold the solution&quot;.<br /><br /><br />As a side note, I&#039;ve started CBT therapy, as that seems the best (by far) way to reduce anxiety.<br /><br /><br />-PB

				Yeah, so my potency in dosage isn&#039;t far off between Klonopin and Valium.&nbsp; So far Valium is a flop for me.&nbsp; I dosed 5mg yesterday for a social activity yesterday and wasn&#039;t pleased with the effect.&nbsp; Klonopin has me clear-headed with basically no anxiety while working- this at .25 mg for the day.&nbsp; The half-life of Valium is a concern of mine per tolerance build-up.&nbsp; Except for tapering I think for anything with a &quot;full day&quot; of effect, the lower the half-life the better.<br /><br />Thanks for the Phenibut link.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had coffee on my Phenibut days.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing Phenibut just doesn&#039;t work well for me, but I&#039;m going to stick with it for a while.<br /><br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; I haven&#039;t taken Phenibut on an empty stomach, so I&#039;m going to give that a go.<br /><br /><br />-PB

				I&#039;ve noticed that a week of no GABAs is helpful-&nbsp; I am too comfortable on my GABA weeks.&nbsp; A week off helps me push my envelope for growth.<br /><br />Ketamine/addiction:&nbsp; I have an addictive personality.&nbsp; That being said I lost my stash of ketamine recently, and found I was trying to find it with excessive energy and stress.&nbsp; I have been using it every weekend in a micro-dose.&nbsp; I&#039;ve acquired a small but significant psychological addiction from my habitual use of it so I&#039;m going to take a break from it for now.<br /><br /><br />A note on Klonopin/Clonazepam:<br /><br />I consider, for myself, that the benzo Klonopin/Clonazepam is a nootropic, because when I&#039;m on it I can consider things, be mentally able to handle whatever is happening, etc.&nbsp; It&#039;s a quick way at the moment to quiet my bat-shit brain, allowing me to focus better.<br /><br /><br />-PB

				I&#039;ve made good progress recently due to multiple areas.<br /><br />These include:<br /><br />Being on a path of (getting help for) changing my work and schooling situation, that I feel I need to be on (gives optimism, a sense of direction),<br /><br />Productive therapy (required me to be truly committed AND have a quality therapist and one that I &quot;clicked&quot; with),<br /><br />Heavy (relative) socializing, including healthy physical touch- attending multiple self-help groups, attending a dance class where dance partners are continually swapping.<br /><br /><br /><br />I&#039;m moving forward in my life; this wouldn&#039;t be possible without the drugs that I&#039;m on (SSRI), and that I know are available if I need them (GABAs).<br /><br />I&#039;m now using my GABA days for max 2 days / week for only when I feel I need it (highest anxiety days that threaten to wreck me, e.g., I don&#039;t show up and spiral downward).<br /><br />I&#039;m using less of GABAs to allow the highest amount of anxiety that is &quot;doable&quot; so I can make real progress (in connecting with myself, coping in a healthy way, changing my thought patterns, etc).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Recently I&#039;ve found: <br /><br />I take long bike rides, and combining putting myself into very uncomfortable situations plus going on these long bike rides afterwards helps a bunch as far as growth in processing things in my head/emotions.<br /><br />Lots of water, a low amount of sugar and salt is very helpful.<br /><br /><br /><br />Note:&nbsp; I&#039;m still, happily, at .25mg Klonopin/Clonazepam when I use it.<br /><br /><br /><br />-PB

				Little Update:<br /><br />I&#039;ve realized that I went a little too far in going just 2 days / week on GABA affectors.&nbsp; The consequence was for me to be overwhelmed to the point of not making progress.<br /><br /><br />I see this now as a balancing act-&nbsp; To take enough &quot;GABA&quot; to allow me to function, learn new life skills, process through life, but to not take so much that I become &quot;comfortable&quot; and no longer driven to change myself (e.g., to learn healthy thought processing or coping skills to prevent or deal with anxiety).<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />PB
