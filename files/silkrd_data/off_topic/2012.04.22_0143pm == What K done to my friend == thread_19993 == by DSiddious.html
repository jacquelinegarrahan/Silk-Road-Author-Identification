				Title: <strong>What K done to my friend</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				A good friend of mine has been a long term K user for a couple of years now i don&#039;t know the doses that he takes but from what i can gather it is quite high. I also noticed that around the time he started using K seriously (about 9 months ago) he became very depressed. As a result he became a virtual social recluse, we only saw him when he went to buy food and water. This went on for about 3 months and needless to say i become very worried about his health (both mental and physical.) This is when i decided to intervene, i went to my local mental health clinic and explained his situation. They sent two doctors round to his flat almost immediately. They spent about two hours talking to him and their conclusion was that he WAS NOT in immediate danger but they were going to monitor the situation.<br /><br />This is when he got really bad, he became violent towards me and on one occasion he attacked his sister and i had to pin him to the floor while he calmed down. About a week ago he took a turn for the worse, his behavior changed he refused to let anyone inside his flat. So i again reported him to the clinic who again went round to his flat and yet again the &quot;EXPERTS&quot; said he was not in immediate danger. A few nights ago i got a phone call from him early in the morning and he was saying things that didn&#039;t make sense, things like &quot;It is my time to arise.&quot; So instantly i knew that he was in trouble, i rang the police who traced the call. They found him in his car with a 50ft piece of rope tied around his neck and the other end tied to a lamp-post.<br /><br />He was Sectioned under the mental health act of 1983 which states that suicidal tendencies are a state of mind and therefore should be treated as an illness that should be cured. I don&#039;t know if it was all the K because he wasn&#039;t the most stable person before he started using K, i think he just could not handle it and in his own words he &quot;circum to the voices.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think you saying that is rather immature! I tried to break through to him on many occasions but i couldn&#039;t. And you must understand that i done what i did for his own good. If he had succeeded in his attempt to kill himself, then i would never have able to forgive myself, knowing i was in a position to act and possibly prevent it. I get to see him tomorrow for a short while and if he expresses the same views as you i would still DO THE SAME THING AGAIN.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I did not just decide one day to seek help on his behalf, i pondered over the idea for days and i decided it was in his best interests. He was not living in a healthy way he was not eating much, did not go outside in the sun much/ if at all. He was on a downward spiral for 9 months gradually getting worse, i doubt he was going the snap of it one day. It was consuming his life, id would love to meet the guy who sold him the K i know they are out to make a profit but they cant be that much of a heartless human being to keep selling my friend K when he was clearly in trouble. If there is anyone at fault i would say it was him.<br /><br />I&#039;m unsure what to say to him or what to expect bear in mind he has been using K daily for 3 months at large doses but he has been off it for 3 days now. I was not there when they took him away and i cant imagine what was going through his mind, i just hope and prey that he recovers.

				I suppose i am looking for conformation that i did the morally right thing. He looked like a cancer patient, so you can imagine how bad a state he was in. But leaving him in the dirty flat for the rest of his life was not an option, and i don&#039;t think he was going to make the change himself. I&#039;d like to hear from someone who has gone through what he has or a similar situation. He is clearly going to need a lot of support when they discharge him, i suppose some advice about how to go about this would be appreciated.<br />

				&quot;But hey, you&#039;ve bought yourself a break from your self-imposed responsibility for a while.&quot;<br /><br />I think that rather unfair to say you have no idea of the extent of his self imposed social isolation. Before he started using it extensively he was a happy go lucky kind of chap. Maybe a little difficult to talk to and a private person but he would always answer the phone/door to me when we want to hang out. But when he started to up his dose there was a clear change in his personality and i believe that was down to the K.<br /><br />If i had given him prior warning of my intentions to have him committed i strongly believe that he would have defiantly killed himself before action could have been taken. You might not know how the process works here in the UK, but he was sat down in front of a panel of doctors and psychiatrists and they make a judgement on whether he should be institutionalized. How can that many professionals be wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t force myself upon him i did what i did because if he did not want to live anymore then fine that is his choice, but he was not able to make that choice while on K and to get him off there seemed to be no alternatives. The way i justify it to myself is that i like to believe the world would be a worse off place without him. And if we could make him see that he was loved and we do care about him, then the outcome will not end up with him dead.

				There is no way you can pretend to be normal to these people, if you try to trick them THEY WILL KNOW! Simple as that. Once that the K is out of his system he will be more clear headed and much more able to make a decision about his future.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been in a mental health institution before and the things i saw in there i will never forget ever. There was a guy who was under level 2 observation which means that he could not be out of arms reach of a member of staff. He was having a shave when i noticed that he was digging the blade out with his thumb. Needless to say he destroyed his thumb. But the thing that was most shocking was the fact he showed absolutely NO PAIN! He then got the blade out but it on his neck smashed it in and ripped it across. BTW he lived.<br /><br />But if my friend decides to make the decision of ending his life prematurely then there is nothing i can do about that but what i refuse to do is sit around and wait for him to OD or worse. He needs to be able to make the decision for himself and the only way to do that is with help.

				Well isn&#039;t this thread a shout out to us agoraphobic people&nbsp; :( &gt;:( :( &gt;:(<br /><br />You&#039;re thoughts were in the right place (presumably, assuming your telling the truth).<br /><br />Honestly though if someone had tried to get me sectioned because I don&#039;t leave my home ever, then I think I would BECOME dangerous as I was slitting his throat.&nbsp; <br />The &#039;EXPERTS&#039; said he wasn&#039;t in &#039;IMMEDIATE&#039; danger because he wasn&#039;t, there are many of us &#039;agoraphobes&#039;, and while it&#039;s a disease, it poses no more danger then having a far too overgeared world of warcraft character.

				If you are telling the truth OP (and from what you have written it seems that you are) you did the right thing. You have no real reason to lie about it because you aren&#039;t asking for anything material so I have a hunch you aren&#039;t bullshitting. Sometimes you have to make a harsh decision to do the right thing, you made it, fair enough. Better that than do fuck all and find ya boy dangling. Kudos from me.

				I&#039;ve not told a lie yet, i have no reason to i am purely expressing my view on a subject, which happens to be very personal to me. After all isn&#039;t that what the purpose of forums. And if ever anyone finds themselves in a similar situation as my friend then i hope they would have someone who cares about them enough to make that decision however hard it maybe.

				From what you described your friend needed help and you did the right thing. He wasn&#039;t taking care of himself, behaving responsibly or rationally. To those who say it wasn&#039;t your place, they&#039;re morons. Children, the retarded, the mentally ill, or in this case, your friend in his situation, are unable to make decisions for themselves.

				Well if you must know i was allowed to read the police report it went as follows (from what i can remember.<br /><br />We approached the scene and found Mr.X sitting in his car, the car was running as I and my colleague approached the car on either side. I heard music playing (I think he was playing Everybody hearts&nbsp; by R.E.M - this is his favorite song) i then proceeded to knock on the passenger side window. He looked at me and shouted SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! In the mean time my colleague shot the ignition barrel and the car stalled. Mr.X got out of the car and assaulted me i wrestled him to the ground and handcuffed him.<br /><br />Imagine revving a car at 4000rv dropping the clutch and seeing how fast you can get in 50ft.

				I&#039;m a &quot;my problem, I&#039;ll fucking deal with it&quot; kinda guy. So I got the instant urge to punch you in the face, very hard, when I read your OP.<br /><br />HOWEVER, while I was deployed, I got an infection in my shoulder. Bad one. It hurt to fucking exist. But, I just shook it off because I&#039;m a young, dumb retard. :) Long story short, infection spread, very good friend of mine told my platoon sgt, he made me show him, then, of course, get medical treatment. As it turns out, I had a pus pocket under my skin that was spreading and eating away at tissue. So, even though the fuck told on me, he very well may have done me a very big favor.<br /><br />tl;dr = OP is an ass, but a cool one who cares about his buddies enough to be an ass to them. :)

It would break your neck and kill you instantly.<br /><br />Thank you for making me wright that it was very kind of you. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I still don&#039;t understand, what he have the window open with the rope going thru? or the door slightly open? a fucking convertible, an invisible rope, what??&nbsp;

				He could have had underlying mental issues before he took ketamine. I&#039;m not saying that the ketamine is without fault, it could have aggravated these issues.<br /><br />It&#039;s good that you cared enough about your friend to get him help. I hope that he makes a speedy recovery.

				For anyone that posted on this thread yesterday and still care...<br /><br />I went to see my friend today, at first i did not know what to expect when i got to the reception the receptionist said i was only allowed 20mins. And the security procedures are thorough to say the least. They search everything I MEAN EVERYTHING! When i got in the psych ward the matron said he had hardly said a word for 3 days and that they had to force feed him his medication. I walked up to him, he was sitting in the garden on a bench and when he saw me and his sister he burst out into tears. And naturally so did his sister, i refrained because i knew i had to really and am not one for crying anyway. We sat down and talked things through, he must have apologized more that 30 times. I kept telling him he had nothing to be sorry for and we did what we did because we didn&#039;t want to see him in a box. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, i am so pleased to have my friend back. It&#039;s a start but by a long way not over, the doctors say that with help he could be out inside of 4 weeks and will have a problem with addiction for a long while yet. The real battle is not getting clean bu staying clean.<br /><br />

				Sounds like you care about your friend and tried to do the right thing. I think in the long term if he fully recovers he will be grateful that you did this for him.

				I know you meant well! But if it were the U.S you might have made his situation worse.......It would have to be a major fucking emergency before I would call the law on anyone! They just might come in and shoot first ask questions later......But that&#039;s America! Hope all works out for your friend

				Sometimes reporting someone to the mental health authorities is the right thing to do.<br /><br />I accept that some people might not be social creatures and eccentricity is also something we have to allow for. Locking people up just because they will not answer the door is silly. I might be stoned, getting some rightful loving or being artistic :D<br /><br />That said if someone is using vast amounts of K - and they have an underlying mental health issue then its going to play havoc. Ironically K is being used to treat depression but its a carefully measured dose...<br /><br />&quot;Small studies of 6-33 patients receiving low-dose ketamine have shown impressive results in reducing depression and suicidal thinking. One study showed improvements in depression within 40 minutes! Others showed improvement within hours to days, which is much shorter than the weeks to months traditional antidepressants or psychotherapy can take to have an effect. The effect lasted 7-10 days in some trials.&quot;<br /><br />Your friend was abusing K. Had he used it maybe fortnightly and at a very low dose - its possible his depression would be lowered enough so he can sort his life out. Suicidal thoughts have to be taken VERY seriously and its likely that anyone who was suicidal and showing signs of being able to actually do it will be hospitalized. <br /><br />This is not too bad. Your friend will be able to claim higher benefits in some nations and be able to look after themselves a bit better. <br /><br />Its actually not good to stay in all the time. People get into that habit but its best to go out each day even if its just a little walk to the shops. Some people may be hermits but if you had a friend who never went out and never met anyone to share some love with then its your duty to tease them out of the shell and take them to some event or a drive to the country or beach. Life is too short to spend it sitting indoors and claiming you prefer your own company and so on.<br /><br />We are at our happiest when we have a few close friends we trust.<br /><br />Sometimes a friend has to pick up a phone and make a call that they would sooner not make. <br /><br />For example a friend of mine had to phone up when a friend of his stopped taking meds and started telling everyone he was going to trade in shares and become rich. He also claimed everyone was his enemy. He cut off his family and friends one by one. He stopped using drugs and drink and began to walk about in the early hours singing. He was also naked as a baby. <br /><br />He is now safe in the psych unit with meds monitored. He is coming back to his senses. It would be impossible for even the partner of someone with mental health problems to keep a 24 hr watch. <br /><br />You done the right thing my friend.<br /><br />hope your friend gets out soon and keep him away from drugs unless he wants to maybe come out with you. Entice him out. Maybe he will meet a nice women or something. You tend to find yourself easier when you got people around as well as having that sacred space of your own company. I crave the moments of peace and tranquility. I love staying in. I love going out. I think its the balance of company and personal time plus special time with anyone you love.

				if he was sitting in his car with a rope tied around his neck, out the window, and attached a lamp post<br />you made the right call phoning for help<br />chances are he&#039;d be dead or in a vegetative state right now if you didn&#039;t<br /><br />or maybe for all the naysayers in this thread... just MAYBE he would&#039;ve come out of his mentally unstable drug induced depressive state right at that moment and decided &quot;hey my life isn&#039;t so bad.. I&#039;ve only been slamming K for the better part of a year and now my brain chems are completely fucked.. let me turn off this music, undue the noose and live a fresh clean life&quot;<br />unlikely... WAYYY unlikely.<br /><br />Your decision saved a life.
