				General discussion about how you prefer to trip. Also 200th post, woo. :P<br /><br />I&#039;ve only had psilocybin mushrooms once in the past, and I took those with a friend, diced up on a peanut butter sandwich. It went very well. :)<br /><br />Looking to do the same again soon, and am looking for other methods to try besides just on a sandwich. How do you eat your shrooms?<br /><br />-fmdgscr

				I had a great trip yesterday and used LemonTek as always. I really enjoy it for a harder hit. Taking them normally is good but for an intense spiritual trip I prefer LemonTek.<br />It also helps people with the taste and stomach problems.

				Mushie Smoothie!!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />My fave method which causes no nausea and no puking is to grind up dried mushrooms in a coffee grinder.<br />Get a fruit smoothie, anything fruity or berry tasting (raspberry, mango, passion fruit, pineapple etc). Pour in half the cup, add the mushroom powder, then pour on top more of the smoothie. Stir with a spoon and drink it slowly or fast. <br />You WONT taste mushrooms. The fruity goodness completely masks the texture and the flavour of mushies. <br /><br />I dont take them any other way and you will always trip hard cos you are consuming the entire load. <br /><br />Also there is no loss due to heat or cooking as psilocybin is fragile. <br /><br />PS if you have fresh mushrooms then just blend them with a smoothie and drink.<br /><br />Just make sure its really fruity, I tasted this sweet non fruit based smoothie in Thailand and it tasted like crap. <br /><br />

				I love shroom tea. <br />Toss some chai tea bags in for a few minutes. <br /><br />Delicious<br /><br />Plus it hits you harder than eating them.<br /><br />No stomach ache or mushie taste.

				Use a cheese grater and grate it into a tuna sandwich or something similar, some sort of sauce helps to stop the bits falling out.

				i prefer to simply eat them raw and then drink something to get rid of the taste. mushroom tea is good as well, but it feels like something&#039;s missing to me.

				If only I liked tea. :D The smoothie idea has me intrigued, though I lack a grinder. I figure I may be able to manually make some kind of a smoothie by dicing the mushrooms very finely (or locating a cheese grater as per cyanate&#039;s suggestion) and put it in an ice cream/fruit blend.<br /><br />Also to note, mine are good and dry, if that makes a different for further recommendations.

				I&#039;m a fan of capsules myself. Easy accurate dosage and no taste.<br />I also like to drop a couple grams of shroom powder between a pb &amp; j sandwich. Almost no taste there.<br />Instead of tea I&#039;ll cool the liquid after steeping the shrooms then squeeze in some fruit punch MIO water enhancer, very tasty.<br /><br />Shameless plug, I&#039;m a new shroom vendor, check out my products!<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/abfc0e59ab

				I&#039;ll never eat shrooms again...<br />Only make a tea out of it, or mix it with chocolate!<br />I hate the taste, especially truffles..Nasty taste eaten without anything, but tastes great eaten with chocolate..<br />
