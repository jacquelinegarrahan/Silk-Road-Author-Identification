				Ok.<br /><br />Having recently trolled the Craigslist/GumTree guy, we all know he&#039;s a little special and possibly might not be a keen speaker of the English. He told me he&#039;s in Asia. Now, I find it kind of pedantic to point out the geographical error like he&#039;s Sarah Palin or something, considering the guy opened four accounts to sell drugs for people on a website where people sell drugs and thought that was a good idea. <br /><br />(Why not manage just ONE single account and put up a bunch of listings?)<br /><br />&nbsp;:o<br /><br />That&#039;s a talking point. <br /><br />Also, Australians will apparently buy absolutely any drug, from anyone, for outrageous prices. Australians are like juvenile delinquents or something. They can&#039;t even have laser pointers or pellet guns so getting some Valium and ephedrine or melatonin or something sent by a random, non-reputable person in a country where Silk Road is most arguably persecuted is like Christmas to them I guess.<br /><br />Why would you want to specifically deal with retarded customers?<br />

				I started a thread calling him a retard with a poll and it got 2000 views and he kept messaging me incoherently and offered to advertise for me on his pages so I deleted it. Weird fucking guy...<br /><br />
