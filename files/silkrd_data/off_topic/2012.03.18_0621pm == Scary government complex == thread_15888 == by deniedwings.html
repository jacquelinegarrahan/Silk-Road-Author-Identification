A project of immense secrecy, it is the final piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the world’s communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic networks. The heavily fortified $2 billion center should be up and running in September 2013. Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital “pocket litter.” It is, in some measure, the realization of the “total information awareness” program created during the first term of the Bush administration—an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />From wired magazine, generally pretty reliable.&nbsp; Scary shit if true.

The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes. And code-breaking is crucial, because much of the data that the center will handle—financial information, stock transactions, business deals, foreign military and diplomatic secrets, legal documents, confidential personal communications—will be heavily encrypted. According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.”

				It&#039;s not even about doing illegal stuff, it&#039;s about having less government confirmation on my appearance if shit hits the fan...<br />I&#039;m more paranoid then I should be though lol<br />It&#039;s been like that since I was a teen...

				This is some scary shit indeed. Big Brother and stuff.<br /><br />On the other hand, I really doubt how much they can crack (which strength of encryption). They need to bruteforce it, which is easy to slow down. It&#039;s a whole other story of course if they&#039;ve found flaws in a hash function. But if they&#039;re not careful with how they use the unencrypted data (which was encrypted by that flawed hash function), it will probably come out which hash function is broken.

				Yeah strong cryptography seems like it cant be easily broken especially with a delay on the site, like 5 guesses a min, etc.
