				Hi.<br /><br />I buy drugs on this website on a fortnightly basis (that&#039;s when my money comes in). I&#039;m a nearly 40 year old guy, I consider myself and honest and reliable people, and pride myself on treating people right. I am not some immature 16 year old wanna be drug buyer :)<br /><br />I spent my quota this fortnight getting Benzodiazepines and some Modafinil.<br /><br />However since then I have seriously hurt my back, and I am in agony. When this happens it usually lasts 1-2 weeks.<br /><br />I would really like to be able to order some opiates (even high quality heroin if I have to but I prefer prescription) to give me at least some relief from this pain so I can tidy up my house and at least do some food shopping. I am basically a cripple at the moment.<br /><br />If anyone would have the decency and put the trust in me to lend me 1 to 1.5 bitcoins (who can afford it), it would be sincerely appreciated. I am not going anywhere, and I would never do anything to damage my reputation on the forum.<br /><br />I don&#039;t personally get high from opiates and just take them orally but I am hoping I can get some pain relief.<br /><br />I am not rich but I am willing to pay 40% interest on any loan given to me.<br /><br />I know there are many people always asking for help, and I will probably be ignored but I thought hell it can&#039;t hurt to try. If I have offended anyone I am sorry.<br /><br />I 100% would pay back the bitcoins + 40% interest on my next pay day the 1st of July, it would be in by around 1pm.<br /><br />If anyone is willing to give me a go I can only give my absolute word that you will get your funds back EXACTLY as specificied. My SilkRoad account name is ozzietrader.<br /><br />I am also looking for someone to built a relationship with so that in the future- from time to time- i may be able to borrow funds and pay back interest.<br /><br />Here are my stats, I am a good buyer:<br /><br />Total transactions: 10<br />Total spent: $578.7<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months<br /><br />Although I only have 10 purchases, I will have another 2 completed and payed for within 24 hours. I only buy off good vendors and ALL vendors I have purchased off have got highly positive 5/5 ratings.<br /><br />If someone will take a chance on me (who can afford it), I won&#039;t let them down. Honestly I just want some pain relief and panadeine forte is not strong enough. Unfortunately high grade heroin seems the most economical way to get opiates at the moment in the Australian market- but all opiates are the same to me, and I always take the orally. Been taking them on and off for years, I don&#039;t have any addiction issues with them.<br /><br />Seeya

				They usually just give me anti-inflammatory drugs and Panadeine forte- neither of which help at all, and it takes a lot of pain just to get into the doctor when your back is bad.<br /><br />I had a really good Fentanyl contact and I used to use&nbsp; that when I got back pain and that was a godsend, he was from BlackMarketReloaded but unfortunately has gone down due to a death in the family.<br /><br />Both my father and brother have diagnosed herniated discs, but I have not yet had a formal diagnosis- the Xrays don&#039;t show up the problem. They wanted to give me a catscan (exposes you to the radiation of 100 xrays) but I don&#039;t trust the radiation, so far they haven&#039;t offered me an MRI.<br /><br />But yeah I guess I do have to take some action soon, I am sick of these episodes of pain. Physio didn&#039;t help.<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken MANY opiates Fentanyl (both blotters and patches), methadone, morphine and Oxycodone, and I only use them for short times. They make me feel relaxed and are great for pain but they are not my thing or anything, I could never see myself becoming an opiate junkie or anything, I&#039;&#039;ve been using them intermediately for many years. I would buy oxy or something but in my opinion most opiates in the Aus market are overpriced unfortunately.<br /><br />Unfortunately the doctors are so uptight in my area that even when I was carried in by stretcher screaming in agony when my back was really bad all I got was 10mg of Oxycodone which didn&#039;t do anything (I need like about 30mg). But you can&#039;t ask them for more or they think you are &quot;drug seeking&quot;.<br /><br />Still if anyone wants to make a profit, I am always reliable with my finances! Seeya
