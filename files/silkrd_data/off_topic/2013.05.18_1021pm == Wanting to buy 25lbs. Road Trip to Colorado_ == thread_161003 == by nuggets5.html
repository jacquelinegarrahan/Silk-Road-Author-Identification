				This is a serious question. No I am not a troll. I have spent well over 125k here on the road thus far.<br /><br /><br />I have enough cash to go and buy 25lbs at 1 time.I am tired of trying to get bitcoins, pay my drops for each package delivered, worry about the mail, worry about quality etc.<br /><br /><br />I want to drive to Colorado in 2 months and buy 25lbs. I do not know anyone in CO, so how would I go about doing this. I am goign to buy 25lbs and sit on them for a month,<br /><br />What should I expect to pay per lb of AAA+ top self at such a big bulk buy?<br />Any advice? PM me if you want.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />Stop negging me, this is a serious question. I will post my stats for anyone if you like to know I am serious. And NO, I am not asking a vendor to go off the road, I am trying to get a grower or something

				Best of luck to you. Although Im not sure how eager growers who are able to grow legally would risk it to sell illegally again. I&#039;m sure you will give top dollar ect. but they wont know if you are a cop ect. Idk, I just see it being a lot more difficult than you make it out to be, but I am sure it is possible.

				Be careful idk how to offer any advice about getting it. But have you ever driven with that much weight before? <br />Driving with that much weight across state lines is dangerous, not even just because of the charges but thats $$ right there, and youll lose that if something unplanned were to happen. <br />

				The most weight I have ever driven considerable distance&#039;s is 6 pounds. I would of course make sure the vacuum seals are tight, put them in stick sacks, and put them in the trunk. I can only stay a night or two max in CO.<br /><br />25 isn&#039;t easy I know this...<br /><br />Any more advice yall? I have been looking on BudTrader Colorado, but everyone makes you have a license and be compliant and only offer like 1 to 3 units at premium price. I was looking to spend 2400 per lb at 25 pounds. I think that is totally fair. I can&#039;t go higher than that really. I have to sell pounds in my area for 3500 all day not any more.

				It would probably be A LOT safer to go get it in Colorado and then ship it to yourself using the same techniques used on SR. No point risking being caught with 25 pounds and no way to deny it is all yours.

Broker a bulk deal and arrange for it to be sent over a period of time which would be suitable to your needs. Definitely don&#039;t send that much at once.
