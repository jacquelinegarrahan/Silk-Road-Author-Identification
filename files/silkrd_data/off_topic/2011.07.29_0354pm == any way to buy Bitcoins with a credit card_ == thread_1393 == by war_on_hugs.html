				The only way I could think of would be to use a credit card to fund a western union, but if you are going to send a WU you may as well just use cash. Pretty sure no one who sells bitcoin directly accepts cc&#039;s as they are a reversible form of payment.

				^ Correct, you do need a bank account. But if you have a credit card then you must have a bank account anyway.<br /><br />While using your bank account isn&#039;t nearly as quick as paying with a credit card (dwolla takes days to confirm a payment) it is the best option as far as I know.

				I&#039;ve used http://1209k.com/bitcoin/ to buy bitcoins with my cc, it was quick and easy, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;d recommend it too much because it&#039;s traceable as all get out.<br /><br />Well, I just checked the site and it seems he has closed the shop as of today! But I&#039;d still keep an eye on it if you are determined to trade bc this way, as he may reopen.

				short answer NO<br />You can buy a credit card with bitcoin but no one in their right mind will hand over valuable bitcoin for reversible credit card.

				Good rule of thumb is to be paranoid but not too paranoid or else you wouldn&#039;t be here.<br />-I wouldn&#039;t risk using direct cc for btc funding.

				i know how, i came up with this for myself as i have no bank account and wanted a way to turn cash into btc, it may be a bit roundabout but itll work and allow you to change good old cash/card into btc in a matter of 10 mins or so, heres what you need to setup:<br /><br />setup an account at netteller<br />setup an account and avatar on second life<br />setup an account on virwox<br /><br />done that? good good, now on with getting that cash converted, we could take the netteller step out and use paysafe card to fund virwox instead but theres a shocking 20% charge for funding by paysafe and being a penniless bum i dont like spending where i dont have to, netteller transfers are only a 3.5% fee, so now<br /><br />head to your local shop that supports paypoint/payzone and buy a ukash voucher for the amount you want, pay with your card or cash or whatever means the shop accepts/you choose, go home and load the ukash onto your netteller account, now load the netteller balance to your virwox account, you should now have the amount shown in your virwox account, now you need to sell that currency on the market for SLL$, then sell your SLL$ for BTC and youre home free (market transfers are instant) just remember to clean your coins after, especially if you used your cc to buy them

				see using my method you dont actually have to send the lindens to sl at all, they stay in the virwox account and are only in SLL form for a few mins while you hit the trade to btc and buy buttons so youll have no trouble using lindens you just need an avatar tagged to your account after that you never have to have anything to do with sl again thankfully, or so it seems so far anyway

				It would be nice to buy bitcoins &quot;instantly&quot;. Currently there is no easy way to make impulse purchases with bitcoins unless you already have them in your possession. <br /><br />Depending on your point of view, that may be a good thing.<br /><br />Especially since bitcoin transactions are irreversible.<br /><br />So, plan ahead and be careful.<br /><br /><br />SB

				you can also fund virwox directly with a paysafe card which i think is available us, or possibly a prepaid mastercard although im not sure on that one, on the downside though using the paysafe card comes with an astronomical 20% fee
