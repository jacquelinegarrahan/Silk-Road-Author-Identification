				Loved the ending. Walt basically told Hank to watch his back!<br /><br />I have no idea what I think is going to happen next, all the foreshadowing to the future at the beginning of the episode and prior episodes is strange. I can&#039;t quite make sense of it. It seems like maybe Walt was locked up for years and comes back to go to war. It was weird how his house was busted, and even more strange that &quot;Heisenberg&quot; was spray painted in his living room.<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait til the next episode!

				Episodes are also posted on Project Free TV: just Google. You do NOT have to sign up for anything, and it is free to stream. Some episodes will be faster than others, so you have to play around with the links. Also, there WILL BE pop-ups: just click out of them as fast as you can (only when the show is loading).<br /><br />Okay!&nbsp; All I can say is WOW!&nbsp; Cranston did an awesome job directing this episode, and especially the end scene.&nbsp; He also&nbsp; refused a stunt double for the final scene of this episode, lol.<br /><br />I just keep thinking of what Marie is going to think and how Walter Jr.&#039;s heart will be broken if he lives to hear who his dad really is.&nbsp; Both actors did an incredible acting job in that final scene. &quot;Tread lightly,&quot; lol<br /><br />I also loved how Skyler confronted Lydia.&nbsp; And poor Jesse. I would have loved to have been that homeless man, though!&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I was glad to see Badger and Skinny Pete back, and of course I adore Saul.<br /><br />Some writer wrote an entire analogy of&nbsp; breaking bad in comparison to Badger&#039;s Star Trek script that&nbsp; was pretty funny/amazing.&nbsp; Just&nbsp; Google it.&nbsp; lol<br /><br />Anyhoo.............I can&#039;t wait until Sunday night!

				I don&#039;t think it can end well for Walt. It is very much a classic tragedy....the hero destroyed by a single character flaw: Pride. He has done too much bad stuff.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My prediction would be he ends up with the cancer cured. Either in prison, or free with loads of money.

However, Vince has stated repeatedly that the entire premise for the show was to turn an ordinary man into Scarface. I didn&#039;t quite take that literally until I saw the machine gun in the trunk at the beginning of Season 5 (Part 1 and 2).<br /><br />I think he&#039;s going out guns blazing.

				It could be both: he loses his family THEN goes out guns blazing. Maybe the cartels have attacked his family in an attempt to force him back to the lab? Hence&nbsp; the trashed house and &#039;Heisenberg&#039; graffiti. His family have to go into witness protection without him....so he tools up and goes out for massive vengeance! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I like this idea.

				I just LOVE reading all this speculating, lol<br /><br />I did NOT like that much foreshadowing at the beginning of the last episode, but I guess we all knew it was unavoidable. I just hope the family is in witness protection and not all dead.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; <br /><br />I like all the ways that Walt was like Gus in this episode: how he put the towel under his knees before he threw up, how he was so meticulous with the car wash, and there were a few other things not coming to mind right now, but they were there, in addition to Lydia coming to his place of business, and the tracker.<br /><br />I hadn&#039;t thought about the medical bills. Funny Walt didn&#039;t throw that in Hank&#039;s face right away.<br /><br />And I agree about Jesse. How I want Jesse to LIVE (since he was not supposed to live past Season One anyway) and just take all that money and FLY AWAY somewhere and be HAPPY!&nbsp; He could bring Badger and Skinny Pete with him for constant entertainment, lol.<br /><br />SO bittersweet. I can&#039;t wait to watch, yet I just don&#039;t want this show to end already!&nbsp; :(

				Here is a theory, i dont necessarily believe it but..<br /><br />Walt finds out that his youngest child is not actually his and that it is Ted&#039;s child. He loses his shit and kills Skyler in a fit of rage and thats when the police start investigating him and it becomes clear that the car wash is set up as just a way to launder money. it becomes apparent that it is drug money and that some of that money has been used to pay Hanks medical bills.

				Everybody is going to die. Something, I&#039;m not sure what, brings Walt back from being on the lamb in New Hampshire. I&#039;d guess it&#039;s vengeance for whatever gets done to Jesse. Remember, Jesse is the only one besides Walt who can cook the Blue, and that black widow Lydia needs the cook straightened out. <br />Anyone remember in the 1st half of season 5, last year, when Walt Sr and Walt JR were eating popcorn and watching Scarface? It was the &quot;say hello to my little friend&quot; scene ? Well, Walt makes 1 comment about it, he say&#039;s , and this might not be the exact wording, but, he says, &quot; man, everyone dies in this&quot; .&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Again, everyone dies.

				Tell ya what, Breakin Bad, in my opinion, is one of the best all time TV shows, thats including the cable shows like The Sopranos. I had all episodes on my DVR and would just watch it when I had nothin else happening. I&#039;m gonna be bummed when it ends, but, they&#039;re doing it right. They&#039;re not gonna jump the shark with this show, thats for sure.

And emotional for Walt as well to lose his family.&nbsp; I&#039;m quite scared as to how that is going to play out, I am going to be terrified watching the last 3 episodes.&nbsp; I also think the ricin is either for himself or Jesse, as long as Jesse doesn&#039;t kill himself first :/<br /><br />

				Yes, it was obvious Lydia knew about it beforehand. She crouched down BEFORE the bullets went flying.&nbsp; I just thought it hysterically funny how she did not want to &quot;see,&quot; and &quot;gentleman Todd&quot; leads her through the dead bodies and blood, which matched her designer heels.&nbsp; Then the one guy says, &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;&nbsp; lol<br /><br />Vince Gilligan says we may not know how this all connects, but it definitely will.<br /><br /><br /><br />I keep thinking, can you imagine if they had killed off Jesse in Season One as was the plan?&nbsp; This show would NOT be the same without him. One of my ATF scenes is when he had dinner with Walt and Skyler. I don&#039;t think I have laughed so hard.<br /><br />I can&#039;t wait to see the confrontation between Hank and Jesse and if Hank will get Jesse to say ANYTHING.

Walt takes a look at himself in the mirror, starts coughing and pops some pills. Secondly, if he happens to have faked his own death or is on the run(one of which I am going to assume for lack of a better reason) hence why he would change his identity. Then he certainly is not following up on any doctor appointments or chemotherapy to stay off the radar. Cancer patients lose their hair when going through chemotherapy. My grandfather had cancer and lost his hair in the process. My great aunt who had cancer a couple years following did not opt to any form of chemotherapy. despite having cancer, she did not lose her hair. Another little random fact I heard(even from Vince Gilligan himself on &quot;talking bad&quot;) is that cancer patients who have to go through chemo a second time or more, tend not to lose their hair through the process. I don&#039;t know the science behind it, but im sure you can look it up. Vince even said there&#039;s still a possibility of Walt with or without cancer at that point in time because of that fact. I personally think he still has it because he clearly has it right now as we know, but from the first flash forward scene he takes those pills in the bathroom coughing, and not to mention (I mean who knows what Walt has been through up to that point honestly idk) but he just looks sorta like shit in both flash forwards(that could be for many many reasons though). I sure as hell dont know the fate for any of the characters on the show, but I if i had to place a bet on any one of them.. I would guess that for Walt, his cancer will be the downfall of himself and his ego... From episode 1 its been the cancer all along that made Walt become the iconic &quot;Heisenberg&quot;. Despite all the chaos that has impeded on his life and the lifes of others thus far from his decisions. He always somehow ends up on top &quot;winning&quot; with some breathing room for himself(despite the reality of how shitty a situation really is). no one has been able to take him down. Most probably don&#039;t have to the balls because hes become so ruthless. However I feel the sheer irony of Walt being killed by two things (his cancer &amp; maniacal mind that started this whole fiasco) would be classic &amp; bring the show full circle. It just makes sense to me. Who else take down the evil &amp; mighty Heisenberg than the weak &amp; cancerous Walter White that lies within?...idk.. I&#039;m sure there are various other opinions here on this topic, but who really knows. We all will soon enough, that&#039;s for sure. can&#039;t waaaiiiit!

				only a few hours til I get my BB fix!.. seriously. for me, waiting on new breaking bad episodes to unravel is like waiting on a dealer who&#039;s taking his sweet ass time while you&#039;re sick as a dog at home. Then you only get enough to make the sickness go away temporarily. when the episode air, they give enough to leave me feeling happy yet &#039;content&#039; for that moment &amp; a brief period of time after to discuss. However FAR from satisfied because Im always left sitting on the edge of my seat wanting more &amp; all my questions answered! Then I just go on the web looking up anything Breaking bad related shit. <br /><br />I love hearing peoples theories of what could happen. good or bad, its exciting to think about &amp; that it we will know in just over a month!! Though the week long stretch to each episode can be strenuous at times. It does make it all the better, its best not to rush a good thing.&nbsp; Anyway..yeah. I hope to chat with some people following the episode. I am usually on the clear net during the show on story sync, but I might check this page out in between at one point to see what dialogue is unfolding. Talk to yall later!

				oh man, I wont spoil anything then, But seriously. For me, emotionally. It was a lot of stuff to handle reflecting on it after the show... lol, I never usually react the way I do when watching television alone as i do with Breaking Bad. the greatness of it just gets under my skin.&nbsp; Just be prepared for more unpredictable intensity as the episode unfolds. In a spectacular way! I thought I was, but surely was wrong. This season is on a whole other level, &amp; it&#039;s just the beginning.

				yeah i recommend finding a torrent as well. though, I see where you are coming from staying one step behind so there&#039;s something to watch when you choose. I personally would not have the patience to do that knowing there is brand new content to watch and discuss week to week. I caught up with the show last year watching the episodes back to back so I could stick with it through season 5; not knowing it split into 2 parts, lol that was cringing to find out. However it built some tolerance for me to handle the week gap between present episodes. Its bittersweet to think they are taking it slow unraveling the end of this series, yet each episode feels like its all traveling at the speed of light. If these last episodes were available on nextflix right this moment to watch, Id surely indulged in them all back to back. No doubt I would be overjoyed to say the least; but also overwhelmed with so much madness in a 8 hrs of time. In short what I&#039;m saying is, it is nice to pace shows like this so I totally get why you&#039;d purposely stay a step behind.

Even so, if we were to ever see another Breaking Bad cook scene at this point in the show (which I do believe will happen at least one more time before the end of the series). It sure as hell won&#039;t be Walt or Jesse opening up shop. that particular infrastructure(nice word haha) HAS fallen &amp; disintegrated.(to me) The show is now geared a total different direction, but still relevant to everything that has taken place over the past 5 seasons. Im super excited, excuse my rants lol Its all sorta like newtons 3rd law. Everything is going to come full circle! :)

Maybe she&#039;ll kidnap Walt Junior to help persuade Walter to return to his true vocation?

It gets complicated here, but basically Jesse realises Walt was doing a number on him over the ricin so Jesse would switch allegience from Gus back to Walt. And then Jesse realises that Saul must have played a part in poisoning Brock with the lilies.

Whenever something major happens, it&#039;s always turned out to be a part of the plot, rather than a sideshow to explain something to the viewers. As the story was written, if Walter hadn&#039;t gone to Jesse&#039;s house, Jane wouldn&#039;t have died. I can&#039;t believe that scene was included just to show us how ruthlessly amoral Walter had become. Maybe there are breadcrumb clues left behind (like the pick-pocketing of the ricin several episodes ago suddenly becoming a pivitol part of the current plot)? Or maybe Walt will spill the beans as part of some devious plan?<br /><br />But for now, the big question is whether Jesse is going to light the gasoline! As you say there are so many sharp turns. My guess is that if he was going to do it, then it would have been the last scene of the episode, because it would have made such a great ending. Any thoughts?

				*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I think jesse&#039;s going to steal walt&#039;s baby as a sort of revenge for Brock.

Im sure Jesse wants to do what he can to get back at walt, but Jesse has never ever been okay with harming children. He would not stoop to walts on level if he bumps into jr or holly in the midst of what hes doing. imo

				This is long so i didnt edit this so be prepared, but i hope this answers your question... ok, so. It wasnt the ricen it was the lily of the valley. Walt had to trick Jesse into thinking it was the ricen and that walt did it so that jesse would come to his house and kill him. Cause at that point in the series Jesse was not cooking with walt, he was cooking by himself with slight assistance from gus&#039; helper(that black dude). That nitch in time where jesse was going to kill walt, was his only chance to manipulate jesse into thinking the poisoning of brock was GUS and that was because gus had made the hit on brocks brother(that little kid who killed combo &amp; selling meth on the street) so that made a lot more sense to jesse and he switched back to walts side and giving him room to breathe to plot the killing of fring. When walt finally succeeded of that, he asked how brock was, and jesse said that when he got out the ER the docs said it was not ricen, but the lily of the valley. Walt acted confused, but im sure jessie had his suspicion right from that moment but could not pin point how or why walt would even do such a thing. So that scene when jesse finds out is basically a revelation to how he knew it was walt that poisoned brock and stole the ricen from jesse. Jesse knows that it wasnt the ricen but the fact that he found out it was stolen from him &amp; that he outed himself to the docs and had to speak with FEDs following that he had mentioned ricen may have been the cause, doesnt make him any happier in that revelation. Im sure next episode walt is going to try and explain his reasons for what he did to jesse and brock &amp; all of that. But I really doubt jesse will care to hear any bull after this one when he already called walt out on working him this past episode and walt still worked him over after that psychologically

Walt didn&#039;t poison the kid with ricin, he poisoned him with a berry that grows on some plant down there. The Dr&#039;s said the berry is sweet and kids sometimes eat it and get poisoned. At the end of season 4, they showed that plant in a pot out by Walt&#039;s pool. <br />So, Walt did poison the kid, just not with ricic. He had Saul get his guy Hule, or Huell? that character cracks me up, take the ricin so Walt could plant the idea that Gus got it in the lab somehow and did it, seeing how Gus has a history of letting kids get murdered when it served his evil genius schemish plot. bringing Jesse back into Walts corner. Jesse is just totally off the wall and has himself convinced walt poisoned the kid with ricin. He did poison him, just not with ricin but with the berries.

				OK I get it now!&nbsp; +1 to the both of you for helping me understand that.&nbsp; I agree Jessie has come unglued and the way he was acting at the end of the last episode I too doubt he&#039;s going to want to listen to what Walt has to say.&nbsp; In fact, what I think is somehow Jessie and Hank are going to come together to get back at Walt!&nbsp; Hank is backed into a corner with the bogus confession DVD Walt made and he&#039;s going to need to find a way to not let that bite him in the ass.&nbsp; Does anyone else think Jessie and Hank could start to work together somehow to busted Walt?&nbsp; Hank did after all offer to get Jessie off the hook if he helped him bring Walt down.&nbsp; What&#039;s also interesting is the fact that the wives are sisters so while at this point each in standing strong with their husband, you never know if Skyler could change her mind about sticking with Walt because Marie might convince her to do something to help get Walt busted.&nbsp; Man this show is the best and I hate having to wait a week for each new episode!

				I can&#039;t see Jesse working with Hank, he freakin hates him and it goes against his principals. He could kill Walt but I don&#039;t see him cooperating with DEA. I think B4 he has a chance to extract his vengeance, that Black Widow Lydia will grab him , well, get her aryan friends to grab him to start cooking because that Todd kid won&#039;t be able to handle it.

				If that were to be the case I would not be surprised if Jesse would end up killing todd, or vise versa. you know for a fact that Jesse has not forgiven todd for killing that boy but Im sure they may come into contact, idk how though. anyone else notice saul and jesse waiting in the dessert for walt. then jesse watches a similar tarantella to the one the boy was holding when he was shot crawling on the ground?. todd ended up keeping the boys jarred one.

Also, what is the deal with that yellow remote car weve seen a couple times thus far into the season? clearly its for shadowing something, i just cant imagine what. and as far as hank and jesse teaming up 88 is right. im sure that is exactly what hank NEEDS haha and i feel we will see him getting pretty desperate and more &quot;shady&quot; cause without him on his side hanks in a deep deep whole from where the show has left off this past episode.

Hank was arguing with her, as much as Hank has it in him to argue with her at all, it was really just a heated conversation about her seeing her shrink for her kleptomania issues, and she got pissed, pulled out of their driveway and ran the kids car over, pretty sure on purpose. Hank wound up giving the kid some money to buy a new one.

I think the writers were just fucking with us, having a little fun.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m going to go out on a limb and speculate that the recurring RC car/big vehicle scenes are completely intentional and are a serious literary device in the screenplay, for a couple reasons.<br /><br />Imagine that this is purely symbolism: The kid in the street has an object of his affection destroyed or put at risk many a time over the seasons, whether by Walt, Marie, or otherwise. The games the older adults play (Walter, Hank, Marie, and Skyler) put the younger characters at risk (Jesse, Jane, Brock, the child who&#039;s actually running the RC car). We see this time and time again with Walter&#039;s actions, steamrolling over everyone he can manipulate to protect himself and his family - though possibly more often to protect himself.<br /><br />The little car getting crushed by Marie is so far the only time the motif has really changed, where the car actually gets smashed rather than just having a close run-in, though most of the characters who get stepped on by the more powerful characters end up dead or severely injured (Tuco, Gus Fring, Ted Beneke, the latest round of distributors for Walt&#039;s former product (at the hands of Lydia and Todd&#039;s gang of violent relatives)).<br /><br />I will also go as far as to say that the car will again be crushed before the season is out, and will foreshadow at least one more Walt-related manipulation, one that results in death or serious incapacitation.

				super interesting speculation, I like that theory a lot!!.. <br /><br />Honestly Walt has ultimately been trying to &quot;protect and secure&quot; his family with the wealth he has obtained through business yet still trying to appear as a father figure to his children.Now what im about to say here is quite a stretch for me to say but I am going to just throw this out based on no evidence to support it, just a thought for fun to think about. The irony of Walt jr probably dieing or getting killed somehow, and who knows by the end of all this what will happen with everyone else walt may quite possibly die of cancer(Thats what I predict without a doubt personally); and idk if walts money will still be accessible or not. However if baby holly survives through whatever madness that ends the series, if her father or family is gone or whatever. remember that video from 107 before she was born recorded at her baby shower? How much of a trip would that be if someone got a hold of that video and showed it to her as an adult.. cause technically she is just an infant and if anything were to happen to her family she would have no recollection of her time with her family as a new born. This is just a weird thought cause i remembered that tape, and i mean there is gonna be an end for everyone on this show. Its def probably way way out there, just hypothetically speaking, that would pretty wild. lol idk i mean even watching that a few moments ago, walts tone is so grimm. like if he did not expect to last long following his recent diagnosis &amp; be able to raise his daughter.

				I don&#039;t have time to read all the responses, even though I wish I did, but I have to stop in and say that, in retrospect, I LOVED The Confession.&nbsp; At first I was really turned off by the idea of Walt&#039;s &quot;confession,&quot; thinking, &quot;who would believe that?&quot;&nbsp; Then I realized it isn&#039;t really something Walt believes he could get the D.E.A to believe. IMO, it was just to get Hank thinking about all of his involvement and the consequences of turning him in (DuH, lol).<br /><br />I know there is controversy over the &quot;cigarette caper,&quot; because some people (in reading a ton of forums) believe that was a weak spot in that previous episode. But I followed it perfectly, feeling that it is perfectly logical that Jesse would put two and two together. He is not stupid, and he loves children, especially Brock, and I know that is something that always bothered him, weighed on him. Now he realizes just how deep Walt&#039;s lies go.&nbsp; And he got Saul to confirm it all for him.<br /><br />Jesse.&nbsp; Poor Jesse. My heart broke for him, when he was talking about Alaska with tears in his eyes, and I wish he was there, but alas, this is Breaking Bad.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think the house burns, either, because in the teaser before the episode where Walt goes into his home, it is destroyed, but not burned.<br /><br />Every single thing that comes out of Walter White&#039;s mouth is a lie or a statement to manipulate someone.&nbsp; Playing the &quot;cancer card&quot; with his dear, innocent son should give him a one-way ticket to hell, alone. <br /><br />How long do you think it will be before Walt returns Todd&#039;s call?<br /><br />Aaron Paul deserves an Emmy for that scene in the dessert.&nbsp; I also still adore Saul. When WW told him to &quot;take a walk&quot; in the dessert, he sure stayed close by to keep an eye on Walt and Jesse.<br /><br />Well, for now, that&#039;s all folks!&nbsp; I hope to get back and read all the responses soon!

I immediately figured it meant something not geographical, but more of like how someone spends their time and effort into a home or place to stay, so too they do this with family.<br /><br />I&#039;m going to wager that Jesse will make some attempt to separate Walt from his family in order to get him to turn himself in. Jesse knows that Walt&#039;s family is all he&#039;s truly been working for, even while running an international methamphetamine production empire. So, to get Walt to spill himself in full to the DEA, he needs to be put in a himself vs his family situation. After all, he did tell Skyler while lying on the bathroom floor after storing the money, that the one thing he truly wants is for his efforts not to have been wasted.<br /><br /><br />Also, I refuse to believe that Jesse is in a team with Hank. Hank is manipulating him like the self-concerned judgmental asshole his character always has been, and Jesse is still giving a fuck about himself, so he&#039;s not going to take it. See how after being manipulated by Walt, and then by Hank in this episode, he bucked their plan and came up with his own idea? He&#039;s tossing the submission role and taking control again. If anyone is to bring down Walt, I want it to be Jesse, and no one else. No one else deserves it. Hank feels involved all the time, but it&#039;s only because the law says meth is bad, whereas Jesse was truly wronged many a time, directly, and by Mr. White himself.<br /><br />So it&#039;s Jesse vs Hank vs Walt. A three-way. And if Jesse comes out on top, I can finish watching this show satisfied. Mostly.<br /><br />See, I really wanted to continue to like Walt. But as you see in the end of this episode, he&#039;s looking to buy Jesse that ticket to Belize after all, and I&#039;m not a fan of that idea.

				SORRY THIS IS A BIT OF A RANT <br /><br />totally agree with you after watching it through again. hank is acting like he wants to team up with pinkman, but he only wants him because all hank really cares about is taking down walt. whos to say hank will really get jesse a better deal if he does help out. You can even tell from Jesse&#039;s end of things he is def not comfortable with hank&#039;s line &quot;ready to kick some ass partner&quot;. lol you can see in his eyes he knows hank is just using him, and quite frankly in a way jesse is just using hank so he can stay safe in the shadows while trying to bring down walt. I noticed(and am probably looking way too deep into this) that Jesse was staring and holding that dutch book for a consistent period of time, maybe thats a possibility of where jesse will flee someway somehow by the end of the show. I totally agree with you in a way that if anyone were to take down walt, Id see it being Jesse. &amp; also(I may be looking way too deep into this one as well, call me on BS if anyone disagrees its just me taking a fun stab at things) but with this plan of walt calling todd for that favor at the end. I cant see that going through, successfully at the least. If anything I would see Jesse finding a way to at least getting todd killed someway somehow because he fucking hates todd and thinks hes a creep. as for the uncles and other parts of his fam setting a hit on him, I think they may be able to find him residing at the Schreder residence, but they won&#039;t be able to nab/whack Jesse. Just because my personally opinion I don&#039;t see Jesse going down that way, If he goes down at all. If anything I want to predict if they find jesses where abouts Hank and Marie will be in the way of him and probably get killed in the cross fire(I am either figuratively or literally speaking I dont have a clue)of trying to get Jesse. Notice how Hank and Marie were only dressed mostly in black this entire episode or majority of it. Plus I would like to think for whatever reason may be just because everyone around him is telling him to do so, I don&#039;t see Walt being able to get &quot;rid&quot; of Jesse the same way he would with any other character in this show. If anything I would predict if Walt truly hired Todds psychotic family for another job, the most they would do is basically kidnap and get a hold of Jesse, to bring him and Walt face to face to finally have the discussion Walt has been trying to having with him since Jesse&#039;s epiphany about Brock&#039;s poisoning. Cause walts intention in that plaza at the end of last weeks episode was NOT to harm Jesse, he sincerely wanted to talk to him, though Jesse was just paranoid because he got high on the meth he still had in his pocket from when hank caught him in the white house(&amp; i don&#039;t blame him for being paranoid, its not just the meth, he wasn&#039;t going to see walt he was meeting with Heisenberg). Anyway as far as what you mentioned about feeling satisfied with an ending resulting in Jesse taking down walt, I agree with you on that looking from your perspective of things. However, If i were to place a bet on anything honestly, and I&#039;ve mentioned it here before, if anyone were to take down the evil alter ego known as Heisenberg. It would make sense to me if it would be the weak, Hollow, and cancerous Walter White that lies within. I don&#039;t see that cancer going away, and all the references to it and no change of his condition makes me believe that theoretically that can be the only thing(in my mind) realistically that will stop Heisenberg dead in his tracks. I can&#039;t speak for anyone else on the show and their fate, but i would not be surprised to see that end up happening to walt. It seems so subtle and anti climactic for a character such as walt who is prime to the show, but everything else is going to surely end on a bang to the highest power I would not be surprised to see them bring the show full circle by causing the death of Walt/Heisenberg to be the one reason why he started this madness to begin with, you know? He thought he was gonna die 5 seasons ago, he thought he only needed what was it 732,000 or something like that? he has exceeded WAY past the limits of everything he brought into play from the start, and in my opinion he is WAY overdue on his death sentence from his cancer. His cancer MADE Heisenberg (technically) MADE all that money EVERYTHING, walt was a wimp and spineless without his diagnosis sneaking up into his reality, it would make so much sense to me if the thing that made him make all these sudden convenient yet rash decisions would be the same thing that brings him down in the long haul of it all. <br /><br />lol call me crazy, &amp; I love your post Fuckmadagascar btw. the insight you and others have of this show is brilliant. I love checking this thread a couple times a week following a new episode.

				Jesse&#039;s candle in this show has not shown it&#039;s brightest yet, expect his most memorable/stunning moment in the next few episodes! He&#039;s been too much out of the picture until this most recent episode, notice how it was mostly setting this weeks up for glory!<br /><br />It&#039;s going to be great!

				Agreed with White Out. The focus now is the relationship between Walt and Jesse, because we nearly got rid of Jesse when he realized his &quot;ricin cigarette&quot; was swiped, and now he&#039;s back to be the one thing that could bring down Walt&#039;s plan. Notice that with Jesse out of the picture, Saul and Todd and Skyler and everyone else still under his control, Walter would have been able to deal with Hank very easily, as noted when Hank confronted him about being Heisenberg. (Walt reveals that with his cancer back, Hank will not &quot;win&quot; whether or not he successfully convicts him, because he&#039;ll be dead too soon to consider it a success. And of course, Hank has made it clear that this case will end his law enforcement career, so it&#039;s a double loss for Hank to do anything right now.)<br /><br />Of course, this was the path things were going on, until Jesse found out something he wasn&#039;t supposed to, and turned his back on the van trip.<br /><br /><br />Another prediction:<br /><br />&quot;He can&#039;t keep getting away with it.&quot; That about sums up what I think they want us to believe will happen. But I keep thinking back to the start of this half of season 5. Walt returns to New Mexico from New Hampshire, purchasing a heavy firearm from a familiar face, and retrieves the ricin capsule from the hidden location in his house.<br /><br />From this we have to keep in mind:<br />- Walt is out of state right up until his 52nd birthday. His beard (and head!) is unshaven, leading me to think he&#039;s trying to mask his identity.<br />- He&#039;s still coughing in the bathroom, so his cancer treatment is either ongoing, or he can&#039;t afford/isn&#039;t accepting treatment.<br />- Walt has money near the end of this season, as he pays the man an undisclosed sum in a sizable bag, so LE hasn&#039;t taken it.<br />- He has need of a firearm of that serious kind that he requests &quot;instructions&quot; for it, so violent conflict still exists.<br />- He has at least one old connection in New Mexico, the gun seller.<br />- He is not seen with his family, and the house is a skate punk&#039;s paradise inside and out - suggesting that he may no longer have any contact with his family. I didn&#039;t check to see if he&#039;s still wearing his wedding band.<br /><br />So, whatever ending we come up with has to satisfy that criteria. My guess is that the collection of the ricin capsule is not the end scene, as the gun&#039;s use is not addressed, so I&#039;m thinking there will still be mysteries left unsolved until we last watch that scene.<br /><br />My official prediction: Walt lives. :P

				I am totally with you eye for eye on all the points you just made. I also agree with white outs quote cause we all know what Jesse i capable of in this show. Anyway, I&#039;d like to also add that I enjoy your writing format madagascar when youre making points, lol I need to do something similar to your format hence all my posts are just a big jumble of words and chaotic thoughts&nbsp; :P. <br /><br />Now, I agree 110% the writers want us to think he WONT get away with it, cause you gotta figure those flash forwards scenes are at least 30 minutes into the final episode of the show.<br /><br />Now I figured that the ricen cig would not be the shows end either, exactly what you said. If they are bringing something as serious as an M60 into this show, they arnt fucking around. Breaking Bad is no game lol. Anyway I would not be surprised if it was some type of desert showdown all over again with whom I could not be able to guess.<br /><br />However, As much as I agree with everything else you said, I CANT see walt living. IF he does, maybe its just another thing the writers wanted us to believe would ultimately end up happening. Though like you said, his hair is back but hes still coughing and taking pills in the flash forward scenes, Im willing to bet and say walt is on the run or faked his death whatever the case may be but he is not being treated for his cancer. Hes still slowly dieing inside.<br /><br />If that ends up being the case, maybe on screen technically speaking we WONT see walt die. Rather be one of those type deals where you don&#039;t see it, but you just kinda of figure he dies eventually off screen. Though, I personally cant see that being the case. I am going to be satisfied with whatever the writers have came up with as an ending to this fabulous show. I would love see that one thing come full circle if we saw walt killed or pass of his cancer in the finale. &amp; like that baby shower video from season1 before holly was born or someshit(which is a long stretch just speaking hypothetically) was exposed to her when she becomes an adult with that lotto ticket so shes just like set for life without a family LOL.. yeah no no, idk, this is why Im not a writer, that sounds super lame reading that last sentence back.<br /><br />&amp; let me be honest for some reason despite all the madness in the show I STILL LOVE Walt LOL idfk why. with all his evil and shit i still see some split bit of good in him and everything hes done is for a reason to benefit him or his family(which yes is selfish but hey gotta do what you gotta do) so as I say I wanna see him die by the end, I will still be affected if he does, like lol same with MOST of all the other characters(sort of idk i just have a weird attachment to the show as everyone else here prob does too) <br /><br />Ight well ill be on later to check in see shiiit check some updates on this and other posts. C ya peeps ;D<br />

I think I mentioned this in this thread B4 , but, I keep going back to the episode where Walt and Jr are watching Scarface at home during the &quot;say hello to my little friend&quot; scene. Walt says something to the effect of ,&quot; Man, everyone dies in this&quot; .&nbsp; ^Then I think of a quote from Vince Gilligan on the Talking Bad after show, saying his original premise was to turn Mr. Chips into Scarface . I think most of the characters are going to die.

Is it so that Hank can have a Pulp Fiction-like sign from the deity of his choice warning him to stop persecuting meth cooks? More to the point, wtf is Todd doing there? If he gets shot there&#039;ll be no-one-left to do the cooking!

				I had that thought as well - from that distance, dumping so many rounds toward Schrader and Gomez and not a single one landing? Yeah right, there&#039;s no way they&#039;re that bad of shots. Completely intentional.<br /><br />My guess is since Walt profusely ordered them not to shoot, they&#039;re intimidating the officers by attacking the vehicles and spraying bullets around their heads to show them they mean business, and also to get the officers to empty their firearms. This could be so they may advance after the officers lose their ammunition, rescue Walt and rescue/kill Jessie, and continue on with the last three episodes.<br /><br />At first, I figured someone was gonna die. Now that I&#039;m thinking about it, I see only injuries occurring, and ultimately no deaths. Again, I expect them both to escape with Todd, and from there, who knows. I am not yet sure about what&#039;s going to happen with the money though. <br /><br />Unless Uncle Jack has a few spare shovels and puts his men to work digging up barrels.

I like the cooking scenes, but what a pity it has to be padded out with all the psycho drama and the cops &amp; robbers stuff.<br /><br />The script writers are not giving Walt an even break. During the drive out to the desert they could easily have had Walt ask Jesse if he&#039;d got Andrea&#039;s message. At least that would have given Walt a sporting chance, with Jesse realising Hank was holding out on him. Maybe Jessse finds out about it in the next episode, but it will be too late by then. Walt&#039;s money is as good as gone now that he&#039;s been tricked into revealing its location. And he&#039;s started coughing again. Gilligan&#039;s really got it in for him.<br /><br />And in that last scene, why are Jack and his friends shooting at the cars instead of at the cops? Is it so that Hank can have a Pulp Fiction-like sign from the deity of his choice warning him to stop persecuting meth cooks? More to the point, wtf is Todd doing there? If he gets shot there&#039;ll be no-one-left to do the cooking! Emilio, Gale, Victor and Declan are dead, Walt&#039;s lost interest, and the state Jesse is in it&#039;s doubtful if he could boil an egg. The future is looking bleak for Euro meth heads. :(<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=202087.msg1525183#msg1525183">Quote from: Miss Sexy Boots on September 09, 2013, 02:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">...Suddenly the screen goes black (Like the Sopranos final episode) Except all we hear is Jessee&#039;s intermittent winging in between slobbering on Lydia&#039;s perfect crotch as she approaches a very very mediocre orgasm...

It lacked the finer intrigue of the classic BB episode. It was cool that Walk got fired up on the way to see &#039;Jesse&#039;, to stop him from burning the money, but it just didnt fit right with me, he doesnt make mistakes like that... I know things really are heading to a climax, but something about this episode was &#039;off&#039; for me... maybe I will watch it again tomorrow with a clearer head :)<br /><br />I still really really love the show.&nbsp;

Hi Chem Cat! Long time no see! :)<br /><br />I know it may seem a little predictable but Lydia is hands down my favorite character... I just love the way she is Quirky Mental Antsy Bonkers... *Reminds me of someone I know all to well... ;)<br /><br />I imagine her becoming the fully fledged evil erotic Madame of the Meth Empire... (I really love all of the other characters on the show... but think that they will all decide to let bygones be bygones and agree to tour around in a Winnebago together all the way down to Rio for the football world cup next year. Everybody&#039;s happy.)<br /><br />This is how I see the show ending...<br /><br /><br />***My Ultimate Vision for the Final Scene***<br /><br />Location: 125 Floor of the Burj Khalifa - Lydia&#039;s vast and imposing minimalistic office. <br /><br />Shot: Lydia is standing tall in a fitted navy blue suit. Her suit skirt is hitched up high over her hips - her dank panties are on the floor on next to her left crimson stiletto heels.<br /><br />Camera shot from behind: We see Lydias perfect white arse cheeks slowly rocking back and forward.<br /><br />Pan Out to see: A naked and handcuffed Jessee kneeling on the hard cold white marble floor in front of her. Ignoring Jessee completely Lydia&#039;s eyes are transfixed on the opposite wall on a number of CCTV monitors (live feed form the chem plant) and Financial News Network screens scrolling the latest international currency rates (including the BTC). Her legs are spread and feet wide apart in an imposing display of her new found power, confidence and egregious insanity. Her aggressive crotch display visibly makes Jessee wince - he trembles with fear...<br /><br />Lydia to Jessee: [Spoken gently, with utterly evil genius overtones] <br /><br />&quot;Now then Jessee... Remember how much you winged and carried on over the last 2 seasons like a complete little mummys boy??? Well now Jessee, have a little munch on this (Lydia rocking her hips forward to Jessee&#039;s forehead). About time someone gave you something to really winge about then isn&#039;t it Jessee.... Dinners served Jessee, it&#039;s lunch time... and this time... you... will... clean... your... mummys... plate!!!&#039; (Hysterical laughter)<br /><br />Action: The kneeling Jesse is ordered to perform slow mechanical oral sex no Madame Lydia&#039;s Lybias (See what I did there!). She trains and directs him with sharp quick cracks to his exposed back and neck with a horse whip.... Red welts begin forming on Jessee&#039;s sex slave skin with each advancing crack. Jessee begins to mumble something about Methylene... His face is covered in Lydia&#039;s rich slimy organic Almond flavored luberins.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jessee to Lydia:<br /><br />&quot;Almonds??!!!! You flavored your front flaps with Almonds???!!! Yooouuurrrrrr SICK Lydia!&quot;<br /><br />Lydia to Jessee:<br /><br />&quot;No Jessee... You just lunched on &#039;Clam De La Ricin&#039;...!!!! (Evil Laughter!)&quot;<br /><br />Suddenly the screen goes black (Like the Sopranos final episode) Except all we hear is Jessee&#039;s intermittent winging in between slobbering on Lydia&#039;s perfect crotch as she approaches a very very mediocre orgasm... Then we hear a thud indicating Jessee has collapsed dead on the floor from Ricin poisoning &lt;Roll Credits&gt;<br /><br />Thats how I see things in the final scene... fingers crossed things pan out similar! Anybody else think this is how it will end?<br /><br />Nice week to everybody!<br /><br />Bootzy-So-Juicy.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I don&#039;t think it will end in Dubai haha. I think Lydia will get killed and Todd &amp; co will take it over.<br /><br />Have you seen the latest episode MSB? <br />What would we do without torrents?

Walt rescues him from slavery.&nbsp; He just has a soft spot for the guy.&nbsp; I think the ricin will be used on Lydia... either beforehand in order to get the location of the lab, or after Todd &amp; Co. are already dead so as to tie up loose ends.&nbsp; This possibly could&#039;ve been foreshadowed in an earlier episode when they met at the cafe; he had the poison ready in hand, and she wasn&#039;t sure if she should drink her tea or if she&#039;d be killed.&nbsp; (if I remember correctly)&nbsp; Who knows though, I could be totally off.<br /><br />But I do like your sexual fantasy and all.

Also Todd hasn&#039;t forgotten about Jesse smashing him in the face, which is why Todd said &#039;We got history&#039;, when volunteering to be the one to beat Jesse to a pulp to find out what Jesse had told Hank about the gang (in the middle of s05e14).<br />

				That was such an intense episode!&nbsp; :o&nbsp; &nbsp;I was peeking through my fingers most of the time.<br /><br />My predicitions:<br /><br />Jesse gasses out all the nazis (remember they refuse to wear their masks), kills &#039;em all. But Todd wears his mask, so might need a fisticuffs/shootout showdown with him.<br /><br />Not sure about Lydia - maybe she sees it all and Jesse spares her.<br /><br />Massive showdown at the end between Walt and Jesse.&nbsp; Jesse wins, then after Walt dies discovers Walt not only figured out a way to ensure his family is looked after, but left a mil or two for Jesse too.<br /><br />Or maybe Jesse can&#039;t kill him, even after all that&#039;s happened, so Walt does a big dramatic Ricin suicide in front of Jesse... (the ricin has to feature somewhere)<br /><br />Was there some foreshadowing with Hank&#039;s wife talking about untraceable poisons? Blamed for Walt&#039;s death maybe?<br /><br />Walt&#039;s family will all be okay after his death, exactly what he wanted at the beginning.<br /><br />Final scene will be Jesse heading off to his future.<br /><br />But then BB has a habit of not giving us what we expect.&nbsp; :o 8)

				WOW! was that great or what? i thin its coming to an explosive end- but i think they have given clues already- remember this seasons started w/ walt at the coffe shop w/ a new hampshire license ( it was his b-day and free food) and he had a full head of hair ( no chemo) and he buys a machine gun- then goes back to his old house to get the ricin-<br />so hes probably going to save jesse- and the ricin? for lydia- who knows- i think in the end he wants to try to do the right thing- but hes fucked everybody so hard he will get it in the end- maybe jesse will kill him<br />but its fucking great!best show in ages

				Hank&#039;s death is satisfying.

				I kind of thought Walts &#039;stupid bitch&#039; speech to Skylar with tears running down his face was for the polices benefit, to make it clear she was innocent. He asked if she was alone, but obviously must have been aware the police would be there.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really don&#039;t know what to predict, that has akways been the beauty of the show. I think a Nazi gassing might be on the cards as suggested above.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I still hope for some kind of reconcilliation between Jesse and Walt. MaybeWalt will go back for him.

Who&#039;s he coming to kill??<br />And its pretty crazy that he still cares about Skylar considering the fact that skylar told him to leave and even pulled a knife on him!

I take each one as it comes<br /><br />Got the firt few seasons of the sopranos downloaded, i think i remember wtching s1 musta been yeaaars agoi but i have no idea what happened, so when i get a bit of time to myself ima sit down and have a marathon session.. sounds amazing!<br /><br />Also, it has to be said, if anyone hasn&#039;t watched the wire, download it and watch this work of tv art<br /><br />Also RE dexter, it started off so good.. but jesus christ man, its like us viewers are retards, his dad ghost explaining every little thing to us because we obviously don&#039;t understand.. 2 episodes left though so i feel obliged to stick it out haha

				Ive watched every episode since the first one and love the show.&nbsp; Only thing... well, it&#039;s changed/morphed a lot from it&#039;s beginning.&nbsp; I always couldn&#039;t stand Hank... but even though Walter had gottten so dark and self-serving and cold...&nbsp; I still thought that after how badly Hank wanted to see him in prison and would go to any lengths to see that happen... even after Walter had become so dark and detached, still, he tried to stop Jack from killing him... and then he got accused by Skyler and probably everyone else after the Amber Alert for having killed Hank himself when in fact, he tried so save him... and no one believed him.. and his own son called the cops and lied and said that his dad not his mom attacked with the knife.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, whatever other people think.. I still root for Walter.....<br /><br />Was good that he left Holly with the Fire Department.&nbsp; Bet she gets returned to Skyler.&nbsp; Walter will probably never see any of his family again... he left with his barrel of $11 mil and the &quot;disappearer&quot;....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />On another note...&nbsp; I really liked Jesse almost all throughout the show..&nbsp; especially the Jesse who was happy-go-lucky and everything was, &quot;Yo! Bitch!&quot;&nbsp; But in the final part of Season 5, at first, I kinda stopped liking him because he was so angry, moody, etc...&nbsp; &nbsp;but then when he turned snitch...&nbsp; that was really fucked up imo..&nbsp; &nbsp; Wonder what&#039;s going to happen to him now that Hank and Gomez are dead?&nbsp; Looks like Todd &amp; his uncle are gonna make him show then how to cook.... but then again... why?&nbsp; Now that they have around $70mil cash?

I was literally shouting &#039;NOOO!&#039; at the screen.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Wire is my joint favourite. A totally different show, an epic of interlocking storylines, I love the way all the characters are sympathetic; except Marlo Stansfield, I felt the show suffered a lot when he became the bad guy, he was too one dimensional. Stringer and Bark scale and their crew you really felt sympathy for whereas Marlo was just a cold blooded fucker.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I love the way the only truly decent character in it is Bubbles the junkie.

				Yeah, walts character development has been absolutely fantastic, i&#039;ve somehow even stopped thinking of him as hal now!<br /><br />Though the amount of people with usernames on here like &#039;Mr W White&#039; &#039;TheRealWalterWhite&#039; Heizenburg&#039; &#039; WWhite256&#039; &#039;IAMTHEONEWHOKNOCKS420&#039; etc is a little bit depressing lol<br /><br />@pusci the wire is great on so many levels. It shows both good and bad aspects of drug use, its is brilliantly written and is one of the.. THE best show ever written. The music they used when frank was going to meet the greeks for the last time, that was just perfect.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nywAi9F137Q :D, i don&#039;t think anyone had used music outside the standard variations for a scene liek that before, and it worked beautifully. All the character developments, i ended up really liking Bodie, pitying D, jumping up in shock when i found out snoop was a girl..<br /><br />And Mr Omar Little.. Enough said ;)

				Remember at the very beginning of S05E01 (Live Free or Die).. a foreshadowing showing Walt (with hair) at a diner making a &quot;52&quot; out of his bacon - like it was his 52nd birthday... he showed the waitress his ID and she remarked about him being from New Hampshire and asked something about how far that was from &quot;here&quot;.... and in the bathroom he exchanged an envelope for keys to a car from a guy and the car had a bunch of guns/weapons, etc..<br /><br />He obviously was back in Albaquerque since he told the bathroom guy not to worry that the car would never leave town...&nbsp; Plus in the very beginning of S05E09 (Blood Money), it showed him going to his old house and it was all gutted and &quot;Heisenburg&quot; was spraypainted on the walls and he got the vial of ricin that was still behind the electric socket...<br /><br />So, I think that in the final episode, he&#039;s going to use those weapons to try to kill Jack and his crew (like he told Saul he wanted to do) while they were both in the basement of the disappearer together.&nbsp; Saul took off, so Walt never got any names of hitmen.&nbsp; There&#039;s lots of scenarios of how it could all happen, but I figure either he tries to shoot and kill Jack et al, but he&#039;s not really much of a hands on killer so he probably gets backed in a corner and either gets shot himself or somehow, he manages to poison them with the ricin before trying to go after them with the weapons so they&#039;re weak and dying..&nbsp; or... maybe he takes the ricin himself?&nbsp; <br /><br />He still has to somehow get the money to his family even though his son was a prick to him on the phone ....&nbsp; &nbsp;I think he still will try to get them the money...&nbsp; &nbsp;no clue how it all happens though.....<br /><br />lol.. not really much help, hey?<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />

				foxen, you&#039;ve basically got my entire thought process worked out for the last episode. The main thing has always been answering the question of who Walt intended for that gun to be used for, and we&#039;ve only verified his intentions toward one group in this last episode: Jack and the gang. <br /><br /><br />I predict that from here, Walt will return to collect the ricin capsule (not sure exactly how he figures he&#039;ll use that) and to buy the gun/car to make one last rescue of Jesse, though I doubt he&#039;s all that concerned about him right now. :P I&#039;ll bet he&#039;ll be surprised to find Jesse alive on his 52nd, but that he&#039;ll attempt to rescue him.<br /><br />And, either Jesse kills Walter for putting him through two dead lovers and endangering the life of Brock, or there&#039;s some weird twist where they wind up friends again. <br /><br />I just want Jesse to come out on top, and for Walter to find closure before his inevitable death.

				fuckmadagascar, yeah.... ya know, I&#039;d not thought to factor Jesse into the possible scenarios.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I&#039;m not so sure that if Jesse is still alive that Walter would save him.&nbsp; Remember, the whole reason that Jack, Todd &amp; crew showed up where Walt had burried the money was because even though he called it off at the last minute, it was Walter who initially ordered the hit on Jesse.&nbsp; Also, Jesse&#039;s a pretty broken person right now after having had Andrea shot right in front of him while he&#039;s still a captive of people&nbsp; who intend to kill him...&nbsp; ???&nbsp; &nbsp;There&#039;s so many loose ends left and only one episode...&nbsp; really hard to tell how it&#039;s all going to work out.&nbsp; Also, there was a scene that I didn&#039;t understand... Marie was riding in a van with I assume other DEA&#039;s or some kind of LE?&nbsp; Private investigators maybe?&nbsp; The driver who&#039;s face wasn&#039;t shown said that they would find Hank.. as well as find [another name that I don&#039;t remember what it was but was not familiar]... then they stopped somewhere and a couple of guys with guns got out at a house that was already trashed...&nbsp; thought it was Walt&#039;s house at the time, but later Skyler was sitting in the living room, then went into the baby&#039;s room and was grabbed by one of Jack&#039;s gang and Todd threatened her about Lydia....&nbsp; so, do you (or anyone) know what that scene with Marie and the trashed house was about?&nbsp; It may be important to figuring out the finale - or not&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And idk if you watch Talking Bad, but Vince Gilligan&#039;s &quot;clue&quot; *Wood Working* ...&nbsp; &nbsp;wtf?

				I agree with you guys that were a bit disappointed with this last episode. I mean, I guess I don&#039;t know what I expected. They did kind of need an episode to push the timeline forward a bit and have a few transitions but for the setup for the final episode I was hoping for something a little more...badass. Heisenberg-style. I get the show hasn&#039;t really went that direction too much and certainly not for this final stretch: it&#039;s not about how awesome he can become, but rather how much his life can fall apart before he accepts what he really became.<br /><br />But yeah, his son came off as a dick. Probably got brainwashed a bit but does his kid really think Walt killed Hank or does he just not care about details like that?

				Shit man, I knew a long time ago that there was no way WW was having a happy ending, but now it seems like Jesse has lost all hope for his. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Im hoping Walt is gonna use that big gun to go scar face on the nazis, save Jesse (who may in the end turn on him) but first they go to Lydia and offer to meet to discuss cooking (now nazis dead) but instead ricin the bitch…<br />Then Walt dies (either by Jesses hand or cancer last gasp) and Jesse gets all the money and adopts Brock (or more likely sends him loads of money and watches him in a park longingly)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really dont know though. Can&#039;t see a happy ending, but I hope it&#039;s good… they&#039;ve got to have some spectacular Heisenberg shit lined up

				@snoopish Yeah jr def thinks his Dad killed Hank. Skyler doesn&#039;t even know the truth behind it all right now because Walt did not waste any extra time on getting the f*ck out of ABQ. I feel Skyler knows enough of Walts business at this point to justify there may be some story behind what happened to Hank(especially after admitting he tried to save him). However she doesn&#039;t know what to believe. I kind of wish they did like some media coverage on the show like they did with the planes crashing committed by Jane&#039;s Father. I bet Walt would look worse than Suspect #1 &amp; #2 on the run.&nbsp; that must have a huge effect on what Jr most likely thinks of his father, hes now figuring out that he doesn&#039;t know who his father really is.

				Breaking Bad is my favorite TV show! Started watching it in 2012 and have anticipated the final episodes since then. Now the time has finally come for the final episode and I have no idea how it will play out. I have some theories of course but the writers of BB are known to throw us off and put in twists and turns here and there.<br /><br />Seeing Elliot and Gretchen on TV in the previous episode made me jump a bit. That came out of nowhere and it seems like we&#039;ll be getting a resolution to the Gray Matter storyline. Why did Walt buy himself out? And will he poison Elliot and Gretchen with ricin because of them taking all the credit for the research conducted at the company? Is that why he returns to ABQ? Or is it because he heard on TV that his blue meth is still out on the streets which means Jesse is alive and cooking for them. Walt wants Jesse dead at this point for selling out and snitching which in return indirectly killed Hank.<br /><br />It&#039;s going to be great watching the final episode, yet sad at the same time. Can&#039;t believe Breaking Bad will end forever. No other show comes close to its intensity, twists, writing and drama. The acting is top notch as well.

				To those saying they are disappointed from the past couple episodes because it has been a bit predictable. In a way I can understand where you are coming from. The way the writers write the script I honestly believe they want us to have an &#039;Idea&#039; of what happens next. I think everyone has their own idea. Right or wrong, this is still nothing we have yet to see. Whether you predict every scene in the next hour down to the credits. Visually, I doubt anyone knows what to expect. I may have an idea for the concluding storyline to breaking bad, but in no way am I prepared for the way Vince Gilligan is going to present it. Its going to make me feel every emotion that&#039;s all I may guarantee.

				check her out on youtube. shes a scottish actress that&#039;s in that show with all those hot lesbians. it&#039;s pretty cool. lots of girl/girl.. and it&#039;s a dramedy.<br /><br />Anyways, regarding Breaking Bad.. I think it&#039;s one of the finest television shows of all time. Right up there with the Sopranos. The ending was certainly better. And considering our community.. it&#039;s also got that &#039;drug scene&#039; thing going on, which makes it more appealing to me (and others here I&#039;m sure). What a brilliant show. Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, the writers.. fuck.. these people are real artists.<br /><br />Also a side note. Anyone remember the issue Walt had in these last few episodes? Getting his $80 million (well $10 mil after that nazi fuckface robbed him) to his family? Had this show been a bit more contemporary.. BITCOIN would have solved that problem real fast :)<br />In fact, would have been kind of cool to see some kind of nod to Silk Road in the show at some point. Maybe even just in passing like <br /><br />Jesse: Mr. White, there&#039;s this site, it&#039;s like totally deepweb, Silk Road.. it&#039;s perfect. We can sell the blue on there!!<br />Walt: Jesse, selling drugs on the internet? Are you that naive?<br />Jesse: It&#039;s not the regular internet .. TOR bitch!! Bitcoins!! yeahh!

She didn&#039;t deserve to die.<br />Todd &amp; co all deserved to die cause they fucked Walt over, but Lydia helped him massively by doing the shipments to Europe.<br /><br />But I think he killed them all so blue meth would end, and it would have been his blue meth empire and he wanted to die with everyone thinking it was all his doing.<br />Anyway it was a fantastic show and a good ending. Although I would have liked some closure on what happened to Jesse &amp; Skylers and the kids.<br />Did Jesse get busted? Jail? Does he have any money? It&#039;s all unclear and I want to know. Maybe I&#039;ll just use my imagination&nbsp; ::)

				Are they really ? i wouldn&#039;t give a shit if they milked this show as much as they can , bring it on! i would watch a dozen spin off shows/movies from it .<br /><br /><br /><br />As far as i know , when jessie got caught throwing all his money around they took his money ? <br /><br />So he has nothing basically ... i can&#039;t just see him starting fresh..<br /><br />But then again , this show was about walter white and it only really needed to give closure to his story , not anyone else .

				Yes Fox, it was that big square one Jesse gifted him.<br />I mean, he has so many things going.. Why leaving a watch behind.<br />MAYBE to get rid of proofs for the fact it was a gift from Jesse?<br />And also, when his now millionaire former collleagues talk, the woman refers as calling another couple of friends to have some &quot;spa action&quot;.<br />Am I a perv or they are swingers?

It was quite clear he wasn&#039;t afraid of people knowing, as numerous people were saying they had seen him in town by the end. <br />Him leaving his watch there to be found later would allow the police or whoever to track his last movements up to the point of his Aryan massacre!<br /><br />Also, perhaps the removal of his watch was somehow metaphorical, like with each move he made closer to home he was shedding parts of Heisenberg. Although, he kept just enough back to make two people think they would get shot if they didn&#039;t obey him, then went all A-Team and created a &quot;hide-in-the-boot-remote-armed-rotating-death-dealer&quot; to gun down a group of guys......he kept the best parts didn&#039;t he!
