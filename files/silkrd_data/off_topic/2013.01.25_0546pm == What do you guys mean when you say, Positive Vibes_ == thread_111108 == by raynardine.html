				Positive energy, feelings... usually humans or any living creatures doing things or maybe doing nothing (peace) to cause positive actions or emotions, thoughts, however you want to see it.

				&nbsp;its like a set and setting kinda thing. .. .. things that influence you are vibes. the smell of air, the color of light, the body language of someone else. Incoming information that changes the setting and set.<br />Example:<br />&nbsp;Lets say you are sitting on a train. You see a dude acting weird, you are holding and he is lookin at people kinda strange, checking out luggage... Is he LEO ? you start to think.. the way he is acting is giving you paranoid vibes....<br />You understand?<br />you really need to trip to get this one.... <br /><br />if you &quot;wish&quot; someone positive vibes its like : i&nbsp; wish you a good set and setting.

				Explaining vibes a little bit:&nbsp; <br /><br />Humans have an electromagnetic field &amp; we essentially transmit energy (think electricity).&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s good energy. When we&#039;re thinking good thoughts we put off good energy.&nbsp; When we think bad or evil thoughts we put off bad energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />The people around us can feel, sense &amp; react to the energy that we are putting off.&nbsp; Some people can even *see* energy.&nbsp; For them, we have auras of color swirling around our bodies.&nbsp; Broad name for the science is metaphysics I think. Some ppl think it&#039;s crap, others believe. <br />

It feels there, and for those of you who want to see it, try some psychedelics.<br /><br />Also, energy tends to attract the same type of energy. An example of this is seeing the same type of people around each other... for example, a gang of teens who want nothing but money and respect, or a group of people who don&#039;t believe in anything but the past and future, those who don&#039;t accept what is now.

				Yeah, the Beach Boys &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; comment does explain it. - I always considered it a 1960&#039;s culture term - vibes - the &quot;feeling a place or person or situation gives you. &quot;This place gives me the creeps&quot; = bad vibes.<br /><br />I often picture Dennis Hopper in &quot;Apocolypse Now&quot; walking around Col. Kurtz&#039;s &quot;camp&quot; &amp; rambling &quot;feel the vibes of this place, man&quot;. Damn, I miss Hopper...

Are any of you synesthesiac? By that I mean you normally see auras around people, smell people&#039;s mood and emotions, hear the soundless song of time, things like that? I am very slightly like that. I do not literally see or taste people&#039;s emotions, it&#039;s more of a suggestion in the back of my mind, and I have to reach within myself to sense auras.<br /><br />It would be awesome to compose an actual theme to express my impression of the song of time, but every time I &quot;hear&quot; it, it&#039;s gone.
