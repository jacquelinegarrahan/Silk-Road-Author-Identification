				Step one: Buy a kilo of MDMA (I recommend albionessentialols) for $13,000 ($13 a gram) <br />Step two: Sell it to your friends/relatives/coworkers for for $45 a gram (very reasonable price), netting +/- $32,000 in profit<br />Step three: Make bail and have the block party of the century, using your leftover $2,000.

				You could do something similar with weed if you know any potheads. I recommend The Emerald Triangle. Their ounces run about $250. You could easily turn that into $450-$500 per ounce, depending on how you break it up.

				The most successful dealers I have met are just like you. They had a good hook up but no one to sell to. The guy didn&#039;t really do drugs much either but was a great people person and had a lot of friends. If you can score a kilo of mdma or m1 and put your feelers out with close friends that maybe go to clubs more often than others or whatnot. I GUARANTEE you that if you tell a few people you have PURE Dutch moonrock mdma at least one fish will be hooked on the line and want ALL THEY CAN GET. This person I knew though had a good enough job, about 50k a year, so he had some friends and co workers that actually had expendable cash. Turned out a close coworker had a big coke problem and played the middleman for selling the mdma key to coke dealer at 45 a g. He cut it though slightly with 850 grams mdma rock, 50g methylone that was rock, 50g amphetamine powder, 25mg dxm, 25mg caffiene. This actually made a good mix and looked totatally legit. We never stomp but it was a coke dealer and no offense to anyone but everytime coke is involved the dealers we have dealt with have tried to rob us or sell us bunk shit and I have just lost respect for the whole coke game. <br /><br />TL/DR: Buddy bought a key of mdma and cut it slightly to where it was still 85% pure of how he had received it. He payed 15k a key and sold it through a cokehead coworker as a middle man to his coke dealer. Received 45g that evening after it all happened so that made us 30k exactly plus 150mg of mdma to still get rid of which was nice.<br /><br /><br />Your in the best position to make money as someone who is not a burnout and surrounded by obvious drug users all the time. Be professional, smart, quick on your feet, and know your laws and you should have no problem.<br /><br />After festival season I have a scheme to have made at least 50g after festival season and spend that as a nice downpayment somewhere in the mountains where I can grow shrooms, cacti, and ganja as freely as I wan&#039;t and not need much money or resources to survive. I would kill to have a fresh garden of carrots and tomatoes and what not everynight along with fresh fruit and ending it by a wood burning stove cuddled up to the one I love.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t sceen trailer park boys watch it now and study the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of the big dirty

Mailing drugs around brings your risk way up, not to mention added costs of shipping and packaging. You could also do some loans on here. I&#039;ve never tried it though so I wouldn&#039;t be able to give any advice on that. +1 to phenbizz for the Trailer Park Boys recommendation, that is one of the funniest shows to ever be on tv. If you don&#039;t have time to watch all seven seasons since you&#039;re scrambling for cash, the main lessons of the show are; don&#039;t involve guns with your drug deals, the guy who lives in a shed is the smartest person in the whole park, and Sebastian Bach of Skid Row will pay top dollar for quality Cannabis.

				Honestly if you live in an MMJ state I&#039;d buy from private growers (you can score like $220/oz because they get that selling to clubs and whatnot) and flip it around.<br /><br />I have a friend I met on craigslist selling buckets to (don&#039;t ask lol) and he&#039;s a medical grower and has top shelf weed for $220/oz to me. I don&#039;t even have a card. 750/QP and I turn around and flip it for $15/g, profiting $200/oz. You could do that all day long on SR if you sold somewhere around $13/g.

				Unless you live in the NE or middle of nowhere midwest then weed isn&#039;t that profitable anymore. Especially from the way this thread started. Doesn&#039;t sound like he could buy a p for 3k and resell it at 300 an o coming to 4800 that quickly. Thats what I used to do once a month to pay for life plus I smoked a ton. <br /><br />I would say dutchaandbod for the best bang for your buck but I would just be very careful with any kind of christmas sales. WHEN IT SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS!!! ESPECIALLY ON SR! No FE!!! at all!! Tons of big dealers, prolly 30% if not more will vanish after having some massive christmas sale most of which require some sort of FE. Dutch has prices that are so low it is unbelievable and I have a small theory he will be one of the big scammers over xmas but I hope not because I love his mdma and his prices are insane.<br /><br />You really wanna make money. Go to DrGonzo and buy a kilo of TOP quality methylone for only 2.90 a gram and yeah u gotta sign but trust me there is no worry in that with him. Then do the big dirty. If your looking for just for sure mdma vendors though I would say old amsterdam or cloudsurfer. with cloudsurfer though I would wait til after xmas because he has some interesting terms lately. <br /><br />BTW I prefer methylone on a regular basis compared to mdma because I don&#039;t like how addictive coke is and how hard mdma is on the brain but methylone combines the two perfectly for me!

They&#039;re Nor Cal based, they have real good prices since they&#039;re in a MMJ state and it&#039;s more profitable to pass the savings onto buyers outside Cali. Their Ounces run about $250. They have both indoor and outdoor grown. I buy the outdoor since it&#039;s cheaper, still top shelf cannabis. You can save even more buy just adding 4 quarters to your cart instead of an ounce.

				I just got a hookup for a pound of chronic for a grand from my mate that grows, so yeah I&#039;d say there&#039;s some definite profit to be made from selling weed and MDMA. Especially if you vend some cheap relatively unknown psychedelics on the side for a huge markup. It&#039;s even easier if where you&#039;re selling has had a drug drought, I&#039;m able to push grams of molly for $150 which is ridiculous. I would never make money if drugs were legalized and people weren&#039;t so ignorant about them, these people are fucking idiots for spending so much but it goes to show how much the American population need their little vacations every few weeks. ;)

				I don&#039;t think this is the case here, but if I were ever in a &quot;fuck it, let&#039;s go for broke&quot; situation, I&#039;d&nbsp; do this: <br /><br />1. Travel to Germany and rent a house there for a few days. <br />2. Order Dutchaanbod&#039;s kilo listing for $13,000. <br />3. Put it in your bag and board a flight to Sydney. <br />4. Chill there for a year while slowly unloading your product on the Silk Road, netting $150,000 easily. (EntertheMatrix is selling a 1/2 gram for $130, after all...)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re caught, you&#039;re obviously fucked (probably a 10+ year prison sentence), but what really are the odds of getting caught on a German to Australia flight? If you&#039;re smart about your smuggling procedure and competent about your storyline, I&#039;d say it&#039;s very minimal.

(EntertheMatrix is selling a 1/2 gram for $130, after all...)<br /><br />&nbsp;If you&#039;re caught, you&#039;re obviously fucked (probably a 10+ year prison sentence), but what really are the odds of getting caught on a German to Australia flight? If you&#039;re smart about your smuggling procedure and competent about your storyline, I&#039;d say it&#039;s very minimal.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn that&#039;s a hell of an idea, I don&#039;t know how I didn&#039;t think of that first..<br />Keep in mind though that the investment capital you would need for something like that is pretty close to the $30,000 that he&#039;s doing all this for in the first place.

				You don&#039;t put it in your luggage. You bundle it in wax pellets, 10 grams each, and swallow them.

				RX....what happens if you don&#039;t have the money?<br /><br />Do you go to jail?&nbsp; That is freaking insane.&nbsp; Have you tried talking to a lawyer?&nbsp; It seems really unfair.<br /><br />And PLEASE don&#039;t anybody look at that photo.&nbsp; The last thread of innocence and hope I had just died with that.&nbsp; Holy crap.<br /><br />It&#039;s like when someone tells you not to touch a hot plate.&nbsp; I just HAD to look.&nbsp; And then I almost passed out....and threw up a little.&nbsp; WHAT THE HELL?&nbsp; What country did they do the autopsy in?&nbsp; I am so glad I decided not to go in the medical field right now.

				If you are thinking of slanging on SR why not do it with some kind of blotters? Those are the easiest to mail right?<br /><br />As far as making a lump sum overnight maybe you can find a foreclosure to get in on and flip it. Sometimes you don&#039;t even have to pay anything immediately or maybe just ten percent. I&#039;ve seen a lot of foreclosures go for less then 10 grand

				Yes it is possible I could go to jail but highly unlikely.&nbsp; Ill just try to be a good citizen and pay but if I absolutely can&#039;t do it then I will get a lawyer involved.&nbsp; Like I said earlier, for the capital I have at the moment, I will just try selling MMJ.
