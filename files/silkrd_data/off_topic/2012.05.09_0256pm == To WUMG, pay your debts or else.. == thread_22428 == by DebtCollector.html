				What im saying is WUMG probably shipped to him- even if you can&#039;t get your money out of one scamming fuck, you can tell him that for tony&#039;s address youll forget all about it, and release tony&#039;s address on here for some sort of cash payment.

				no way wumg and tony were friends. wumg was not happy when tony undercut him so heavily and wanted him to raise his price. They also live VERY far from eachother. If they knew each other it was just by being 2 vendors in the same market. that guy said tony must know him because tony said wumg never get killed/busted but wumg did get busted so tony was wrong. If tony is anybody around here it is the dude that runs BMR, BMR and tony mart were identical sites. definitely made by same guy, so if BMR guy made BMR himself he also made tonymart. Either he knows him or they are the same guy.

				No clue who the dude is, but if you decide to dish out some vigilante SR justice, make sure to record a video of the event. Just wear black masks and pretend you&#039;re the CIA kidnapping a suspected terrorist. I&#039;ll even throw some btc your way for a copy provided it&#039;s legit. Perhaps if the two-bit scammers and con artists saw one of their brothers in bullshit having his feet pulverized with a sledgehammer, having bamboo stuffed under fingers and toenails, having &quot;Filthy SR rapist vendor big&quot; emblazoned on his chest in ink, they&#039;d be less likely to pull this shit.

				we will not hurt him, we just wwant to talk to him first give him a chance to pay up. if he pussies out again as he usually does then he will have his bones broken by our associates.&nbsp; sorry but we dont have any control of what he does on sr and it doesnt concern us. we only care about the fact that he scammed us for a bunch of money.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				well we tried to lay low and let his sr business succeed and make money, but when we saw that he fucked it up a month ago we realized that even this is too hard for his lazy ass and we have no choice. violence is bad for business and we are against it, but if&nbsp; he doesn&#039;t show up to the designated meeting spot this weekend we will have to send people over.&nbsp; he can either pay the money with the usual 20% monthly interest or in one shot 48 hours after the meeting. the choice is his.&nbsp; <br /><br />

You don&#039;t involve family in business disputes -- that&#039;s more of a Mexican cartel tactic (&quot;Pay us or we&#039;ll all rape your 12-year-old daughter while your wife watches, then we&#039;ll cut off your wife&#039;s tits&quot;). Plus violence invites unwanted attention and it&#039;s the absolute worst way to recoup your losses. If a guy&#039;s dead or comatose, he can&#039;t pay. If you rough a guy up too much, he goes to LE. LEO involvement makes it more difficult to collect on a debt, as well as lifting whatever veil of secrecy you may have had.<br /><br />It&#039;s not like DC can go to court and ask for a wage garnishment or wumg can get bankruptcy protection from DC. <br /><br />Although I&#039;ve been ripped off a couple of times for small amounts and been angry about it, beating the shit out of a dude who probably doesn&#039;t have the money or a means to get the money after the fact is a futile exercise. He might be a lowlife, but cops still get pissed when vigilantes (no matter how morally justified their behavior) invade their turf via unsanctioned policing. I&#039;d rather lose 1k than have to deal with an assault charge linking me to buying illegal drugs. Trying to beat that gets expensive with bail, a good lawyer, etc.

				Im sure he got the message, <br /><br />this thread really delivered some scary stuff, if I was WU I would be less nervous about you doing something now than if you would have said nothing at all <br /><br />im honestly glad you lost the money, if you have to pay someone back you should because of your stupidity unless your going to be scum and run off on your friend as well, although I learned that there arent many friends within the business <br /><br />you lost cash and you deserved to lose it, glad it happened to you and not someone else

				Yeah, Debt Collector--I totally believe you that you personally know Wumg, and I totally believe you that you and he had a previous arrangement, and I even believe you that he screwed you over!&nbsp; I want to sincerely thank you for letting everyone on the SR forums know that&nbsp; you are *demanding* that Wumg give you money.&nbsp; I am so grateful that you decided to make your demand public, even though it &quot;doesn&#039;t concern any of us...&quot; (I can&#039;t think of a better reason to start a thread like this--when I want to settle a private matter between myself and another person that doesn&#039;t concern anyone else, I *always* create a public thread online where I can post my threats for everyone else to read and comment on--because it doesn&#039;t concern them, so I appreciate their comments).&nbsp; <br /><br />THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS!!!&nbsp; We are partricipating in an anonymous, online marketplace.&nbsp; Anonymous.&nbsp; Tell me, if Wumg owes you money, and you have the means to collect it from him as you claim, then why the FUCK are you posting a thread on this forum?&nbsp; How old are you?&nbsp; Seriously???<br /><br />I can&#039;t believe you keep posting on this thread.&nbsp; If the money means that much to you--go fucking get it!!!&nbsp; Or if you think sitting at a computer, constantly defending yourself for creating this dumb-ass thread, will be more effective, then please continue.&nbsp; I was rofl&#039;ing for 4 pages of this thread.&nbsp; Maybe if it gets to 10 pages, Wumg will magically pay you back!<br /><br />Just to be clear--you do *not* know where Wumg lives.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think anyone on this thread really believes that you&#039;re going to roll up at Wumg&#039;s place w/ your posse and fuck him up.&nbsp; You got scammed, and the only reaction was for you to create this thread.&nbsp; Good work.&nbsp; The end.<br /><br />oh god this is hilarious!

Sure, I admit there&#039;s a lot of posturing and peacocking that occurs on anonymous forums. Then again, given the exponential growth of SR and number of scammers running rampant, it&#039;s possible that some of these &quot;threats&quot; are legit. SR is a disruptive element in the current narco marketplace. I can&#039;t see major cartel operators throwing bricks out as vendors, but I can picture some lower or middle class guy with a gold rush mentality getting in over his head. Actually, the Gold Rush is a fairly good analogy -- lots of swindles involving land allegedly full of gold and turning up nada. No real system of justice.<br /><br />Imagining a bunch of college kids trying to sling dope on SR like it&#039;s e-bay reminds me of that scene from Office Space when they&#039;re trying to figure out how to launder money and one of the dudes goes apeshit with his rhetorical question about how a bunch of people who never went to college and didn&#039;t grow up in the burbs can succeed so well at crime, but the white collar guys suck so bad at it. If you come up from the streets to the Internet and respect the game, you&#039;re probably going to be more successful and less likely to rip people off than some laid off banker who was fronted a brick and ended up snorting more than he sold, completely oblivious to the fact that the rules keeping his ass safe no longer apply.<br /><br />Just my thoughts. A lot of posters end up too myopically focused on individual players and end-up acting like those brainless asshole fundie conversatives with their splitting of the world into black and white. It&#039;s more nuanced than that. Simplifying your observations of human behavior into &quot;scammer or hero?&quot;, &quot;online threats can only come from 14 year old boys who just chugged 2 liters of Red Bull and discovered their first hard on&quot;, &quot;so and so is now these 5 people -- look! I compared the writing samples&quot; is incredibly boring. And adds little to the conversation. From an anthropological and sociological perspective, this whole thing is fascinating if you&#039;re smart enough to see all the angles.

				Got to about page 3 and then declared this TL-DR <br /><br />Lol at the the bullshit the &quot;DebtCollector&quot; is pulling out. Like someone else said, these hard-core gangster mother fuckers don&#039;t just punish thieving cunts, they also give them fair warning of the occurrence so they can get out of dodge. Who do you think you are John Rambo? More like bloody John Dildo. <br /><br />If you are Gangster Number 1, please share your methods because if you are legit (lol, and you ain&#039;t) you are gunna need some shit hot ones baring in mind that you have already declared that you are coming for him he&#039;ll either be strapped or will have done a runner. <br /><br />James Dean may have been the Rebal Without a Cause, but you my friend are the Rebal Without a Fucking Clue. You&#039;re in the comedy section son, not in the action/adventure. ;)

And think about how trivial the outcome even if a resounding success. To discredit ONE former vendor trying to make a comeback? Like a kid sticking his thumb in a dike hole as water gushes over the top to drown him; that&#039;s some pretty weak tea. What about all the other vendors that never quit busy moving mad volume? Unless it&#039;s a really REALLY stupid LEO vigilante going solo or some pathetic LEO with no life doing it for kicks on his own time (both highly improbable IMO) it&#039;s hard to see how this theory has legs.<br /><br />No ... when LE decides to crack down, they&#039;ll make a big show of it and it won&#039;t be by some pissant shit like this. You gotta think they have a profile on every major vendor here down to their exact geographic radius mapped from postal codes gleaned from buys and as much personal detail compiled from SR profile posts and innocently posed inquisitive PM&#039;s. <br /><br />If the vendor smartly remains vigilant, they&#039;ll continue to change up drop points handled by variety of PO locations far and wide, use a false persona, use remailers, etc but you&#039;ve got to think there are many that just aren&#039;t that careful, get lazy, or are stupid and start using the same drop box, or are clueless to the presence and exact location of CCTV cams on many streets and in PO&#039;s, send express mail, or poorly understand&nbsp; information security concepts, etc.. And when LE swoops it will be a big PR event so everyone involved can get their promotions while championing to the press that they&#039;re winning the fight of good over evil while maybe swooping some buyers up in the sting too in order to sketch everyone the fuck out.<br /><br />&quot;Know and respect your enemy. It&#039;s only very, very stupid people who think the law is stupid.&quot;

Like a kid sticking his thumb in a dike hole as water gushes over the top to drown him; that&#039;s some pretty weak tea. What about all the other vendors that never quit busy moving mad volume? Unless it&#039;s a really REALLY stupid LEO vigilante going solo or some pathetic LEO with no life doing it for kicks on his own time (both highly improbable IMO) it&#039;s hard to see how this theory has legs.<br /><br />No ... when LE decides to crack down, they&#039;ll make a big show of it and it won&#039;t be by some pissant shit like this. You gotta think they have a profile on every major vendor here down to their exact geographic radius mapped from postal codes gleaned from buys and as much personal detail compiled from SR profile posts and innocently posed inquisitive PM&#039;s. <br /><br />If the vendor smartly remains vigilant, they&#039;ll continue to change up drop points handled by variety of PO locations far and wide, use a false persona, use remailers, etc but you&#039;ve got to think there are many that just aren&#039;t that careful, get lazy, or are stupid and start using the same drop box, or are clueless to the presence and exact location of CCTV cams on many streets and in PO&#039;s, send express mail, or poorly understand&nbsp; information security concepts, etc.. And when LE swoops it will be a big PR event so everyone involved can get their promotions while championing to the press that they&#039;re winning the fight of good over evil while maybe swooping some buyers up in the sting too in order to sketch everyone the fuck out.<br /><br />&quot;Know and respect your enemy. It&#039;s only very, very stupid people who think the law is stupid.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>If LE could have taken down SR and done serial busts, they would have.&nbsp; This is assuming they&#039;d even want to.&nbsp; Why would local/state/federal agencies with huge deficits and loads of &quot;evidence&quot; from seizures (drug caches) shut down an anonymous market with which they could unload those goods?&nbsp; Does nobody else suspect the police love this marketplace as much as we do?

				Plus all the different laws they&#039;ve passed in the last 20 years allowing them to seize and sell property they&#039;ve obtained during arrests...and the most powerful union in the U.S. is becoming the Prison Guards Union...and also what about the privatization of prisons?&nbsp; It&#039;s now a huge profit, and the U.S. has the largest percentage of it&#039;s prison.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Most of the inmates start out on probation, but that just guarantees they&#039;ll go to prison down the line...it&#039;s too depressing for words, and they&#039;ll be writing laws about TOR and BTC soon enough...they just have to get some hackers to help out in Congress, then all this shit will be made illegal too...

They could be biding their time for a number of reasons be it logistical or political. Technologically, SR appears out of reach for now. So coordinated and concurrent busts would give them the best bang for their buck in the national press in discouraging new vendors and buyers from the market altogether. Such coordinated efforts take time and patience. <br /><br />As far as why they&#039;d even want to shut it down, I think you&#039;re confusing rogue police officers involved in profiteering from off the books shakedowns or evidence room tampering from departmental and federal drug policy. I&#039;m sure rogue cops love having less exposure and additional channels from which to profit. But department policies don&#039;t allow an agency to profit from reselling confiscated drugs. Departments can, however, add to their budgets from auctioning off confiscated possessions purchased with drug money. Hence why during a time of cutbacks a LE agency would want to pursue anyone moving volume because they&#039;re enormous cash cows for the dept. <br /><br />Also, when Schumer ranted to the press and inquired internally about SR that put enormous pressure on federal LE to do something. Congress is in charge of purse strings and can coerce accountability by conducting internal probes and make life highly uncomfortable for any of these agencies. When a high profile senator demands to know what&#039;s being done by DEA to enforce the nation&#039;s drug laws, they&#039;re going to feel the pressure to show him something. It could be a chance to say they&#039;re understaffed and need more money so a special SR task force can be devoted to its takedown but that just multiples the pressure on them to produce results. So while it&#039;s promising that SR is still going strong, it&#039;s naive to think there aren&#039;t strategic black ops in the works to take it out. The poison pill stunt after the Schumer rant gives you some idea of what sort of tactics could be resorted to if they continue to be frustrated by conventional means. The FM takedown made big news, which is all the more reason the resources focused on that will be redoubled here.

				Turned into a pretty good fucking thread...always good to look at these things, figure where we stand.&nbsp; I find that most thoughtful thinkers, who like their drugs, end up with a fairly libertarian stance, and often, I find the great political figures, who I admire, like Churchill are more libertarian than not...tho it often ends up being conservative since they see so much idiocy that they feel that the &#039;benevolent dictator&#039; is better since most men are sheep...I love the sadly unfinished biography of Winston Churchill by Manchester&nbsp; ... there was a damned hero if ever one was worthy of the name.
