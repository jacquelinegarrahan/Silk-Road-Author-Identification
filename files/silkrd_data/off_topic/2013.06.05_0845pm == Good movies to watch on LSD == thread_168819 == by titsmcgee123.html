				I&#039;ve never understood staring at a television while the world is melting and changing colors all around me with intense geometric patterns shifting spinning changing sizes.&nbsp; I enjoy exploring the kaleidoscope world around me.&nbsp; When I&#039;m tripping I can&#039;t even make out anything on a TV or cell phone screen, it&#039;s a big wash of crazy colors.&nbsp; Except when I did 4 hits of good LSD, I could see a TV then.&nbsp; I guess I like to trip hard...&nbsp; What is the point of staring at a television when you&#039;re tripping? lol

				British Intelligence, great WW2 era spy film set in WWI. There&#039;s mad like double-triple spy shit going on and it alludes in subtle and less subtle ways to WW2. Boris Karloff. I feel like it would be really cool and the drugs would add a nice colorful dimension to the black and white. yeah.

				Three Days of the Condor (it will insure you never open the door for another mailman ever again).<br /><br />The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...I don&#039;t know why but this one was very memorable on LSD...maybe it is an inherent connection with the desert.<br /><br />Solaris - not the George Clooney version, the original Russian one. Think of this as the Soviet answer to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which by the way, is another great LSD film.

				Anything Pixar or animated.&nbsp; The vivid colors of these animated movies are amazing on LSD.&nbsp; The simple children&#039;s stories are funny and easy to follow.&nbsp; But seriously, go outside!&nbsp; A nature trail, the park, hell stand in your back yard.&nbsp; Nothing beats the colors and sounds of nature on LSD.

				I watched the lorax while on shrooms. Was interesting because while I watched, everything in my peripherals started looking like it was part of the movie and changed colors with each scene. Was spectacular, made me feel like I was a part of the movie.

				Old &quot;classic&quot; movies. Contrary to what most film critics think, I think they generally have outrageous situations and strange acting. Psychedelics highlight that and make them weirder and funnier for me.

				look at pictures or even family photos on your walls on through photo albums (it helps you see many of similar facial features of blood related family and is super trippy) also the &quot;michael Bolton acid trip&quot; video on youtube is pretty cool/funny it doesn&#039;t make sense unless you&#039;re tripping though!<br /><br />and who cares if its a stereotype of trip-heads but &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;

				Hey man, <br /><br />To an extent I agree with Jack. The world is far&nbsp; more rewarding than the television riding the peak of a good acid trip. That being said there is something to be said for a good movie to get you through parts of a trip. I really, really recommend watching &quot;speed racer&quot; on an awesome tv. Make sure to get blu ray, it&#039;ll be worth it. The movie was done by the same guys as the matrix and a few others, so don&#039;t let it deceive you into thinking its a children&#039;s movie. It most definitely is made to be enjoyed by adults. Have a blast and enjoy!<br /><br />Best, <br /><br />Dabdiego

				Ahh, I almost forgot.<br /><br />El Topo<br /><br />and<br /><br />NeverEnding Story....but be careful with the Artax/Swamp of Sadness scene. Jesus. I felt like I was being born and dying all at the same time and forced to repeat that cycle until that scene was over. You know what, on second thought, save NeverEnding Story for your sober days.

El Topo is amazing, and the Neverending Story, That&#039;s just classic.
