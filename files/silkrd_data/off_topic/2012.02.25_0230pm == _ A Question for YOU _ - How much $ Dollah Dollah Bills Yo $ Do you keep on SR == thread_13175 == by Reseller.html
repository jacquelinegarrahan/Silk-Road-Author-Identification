				It seems like the amount in my wallet is constantly decreasing. The trigger for the value decline is me buying coins evidently. So frustrating

				I&#039;m only a buyer.<br /><br />I never keep money on SR for longer then the amount of time it takes for me to purchase a product I have already decided on buying.<br /><br />Seems like the most secure thing to do.

				I&#039;m a buyer only. Normally when I&#039;m not buying, I keep exactly 1 BTC in my account. My preferences are set to display in dollars.<br /><br />This way I get to see the exact exchange rate that SR uses at any time. Not quite as convenient as having the rate at the bottom of the page, but works for me.

				None. The bitcoins that are transferred are used immediately, as are any of the bitcoins I receive. I&#039;m not risking letting them sit in the SR wallet and potentially have something happen.

				Only what I&#039;m about to spend, with some allowance for a canceled order, bitcoin fluctuation, etc.&nbsp; If I have a few coins left over after I order, I leave them in my SR account.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even have a bitcoin wallet outside of SR.
