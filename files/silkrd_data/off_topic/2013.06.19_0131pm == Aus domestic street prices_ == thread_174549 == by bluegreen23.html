				I can only weigh in on the MDMA and weed. The weed is about right, usually $400 an oz for me locally. MDMA pricing was spot on in my experience too.

Can give you a head high like cocaine and euphoria from rolling on mdma/mda. Well thats what it does for me...anymore then its a hell of a ride. 8-10mgs of Moxy gives incredible energy levels.<br />Its extremely clean, you can eat on it, and you will have ZERO comedown the next day. ;)

				Hey there is no street price brother, they are all prices you can get all of the above for on the street in Melbourne but there is no set street price.<br />It all comes down to what you are buying. lets look at the cocaine you have listed for $300. you can buy it at this but how badly has it been bashed? at that price you are not putting much actual cocaine up your nose.<br />1kg (brick) of dino coke in Aus goes for around $200000. <br />now $200000%1000g=$200per gram<br />this is top to bottom brother, do you really think these guys on the street are buying bricks! Na they don&#039;t they may by an ounce or two from a guy who bought the brick and bashed it. then they need to bash it to make some money because at $300. a gram that&#039;s only $100 off each right from the guy who buys the brick to the guy who sells the gram. <br />This is the same but different for every drug out there.<br />Now I&#039;m not saying that paying more means better gear I&#039;m just saying there is no set street price and buying the cheapest is not such a good idea in this industry.

People always try to squeeze the price up a bit, but there is sort of a standard. Obviously bulk buy and superior quality can demand a higher price to a degree.<br />Oh well good to know where it&#039;s at for the most part, or at least a general idea.
