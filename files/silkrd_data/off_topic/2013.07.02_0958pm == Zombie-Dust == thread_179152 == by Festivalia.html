Pretty deadly if you&#039;re too gung-ho... but I like the instantaneous feeling of awesome from this combo. <br /><br />My recipe: 15 Mg(1/2 a blue, or 1 green -average tolerance) OxyCodone to 30-40 mg (.03-.04) of Pure Cocaine(high tolerance) to 1 MG of Xanax(low tolerance). I usually feel the Cocaine instantly, followed by what I can only describe as a very nice weed-like stone space/out episode brought on by the dopaminergic and serotoneric surges from the Opiate and Benzo. The cocaine has my whole head numb, while my body drifts out from underneath me into a void of relaxation and numbed nerves.&nbsp; &nbsp;The combo seems to have the least amount of immediate come-down side effects compared to even the individual drugs used... but again, this is a pretty deadly concoction to the less-conditioned user.<br /><br />The xanax seems to amplify the &#039;speed-ball&#039; high, all while amplifying the level of confidence one has. This is a very social combo. Just, again, not if you over-do it. <br /><br />I usually don&#039;t speed-ball anything. It&#039;s like telling your heart to beat slow, but panicking at the same time. Irregular heart beat ain&#039;t no joke... lol... but for the sake of getting fucked up, I had to dabble!<br /><br />When you cut out the Xanax, it&#039;s just like speedballing. VERY social, yet numb high... but you might be a bit geeked/paranoid without the benzo. :P

				It seems really nice! I usually don&#039;t like too much benzos in combos though because of the memory loss and I don&#039;t like having a great time without remembering it, the cocaine must cancel the memory loss out I imagine. I prefer SOMA instead of benzos in combos, it&#039;s more euphoric and doesn&#039;t have much memory loss. I&#039;ll try your combo if I ever buy coke but it&#039;s way too expensive... Do you get your pure coke on SR?

The other only does balls, and to me, that&#039;s a commitment. I don&#039;t want to sell any... and I only need like a gram.<br /><br />OldMcDonald or something, had some fire for 92 a gram. That was the only time I&#039;ve really gotten a gram of SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually buy local from an old hood connect who gets it from the source and steps on it. I obviously get it before he squashes it... lol. It&#039;s weird what they cut it with. Not what most people assume (laxative, baking soda, etc) ... Mainly cheap speed is what they seem to cut it with. They say it makes kids think they&#039;re getting REALLY good coke. And it&#039;s so much cheaper for them. :P<br /><br />Anyway... I also don&#039;t really like benzos in general. I hate when people repeat themselves. :P<br /><br />

				Well you&#039;re pretty lucky if you can get it before it gets cut! Speed would kind of suck in cocaine, it wouldn&#039;t make you able to sleep for hours! On SR it&#039;s way too expensive though... And sorry if I repeated myself, I didn&#039;t know I did O.o
