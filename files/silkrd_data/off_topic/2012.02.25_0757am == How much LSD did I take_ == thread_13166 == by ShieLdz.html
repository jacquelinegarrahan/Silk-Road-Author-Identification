				So a few months back I bought a few hits of acid of this guy, then later when asked me what I thought of it, I told him I thought it was good but kind of weak. He continued to insist it was strong and that I must have a high tolerance, but I didn&#039;t think so. I went ahead and bought 5 more hits off him, which he laid himself on candy, and he told me he was going to make them extra fun for me, but also told me i should eat all five to be sure.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I took those five hits and had the CRAZIEST experience of my life. I reflect on it almost daily. Literally 20 minutes after eating them I was TRIPPING! my stomach began to hurt like it was twisting in a knot followed quickly by the most intense visuals I&#039;ve had, they were so intense I threw up from motion sickness. It was so intense, I had to lie down and wrap a bandana around my eyes to stop anny outside light from getting in. For like 5hrs I hust laid there, without any real sense of conciousness; I simply let go and just was. Traditional rules of set and setting went right out the window there was no guiding anything it was a beast all its own at that point. I&#039;ve dropped several tabs since then, and I can still trip so there&#039;s no permanat tolerance i dont think, but still everytime I dose now it&#039;s like a fucking kiddy ride - it&#039;s still the strength as it was before but it&#039;s just not the same i guess <br /><br />I attributed my experience to fact that I had taken adderall earlier that day. I&#039;m a student and take addy daily (60mg&#039;s daily since high school), and I&#039;ve heard amphetamines can intensify your trip (I guess John Lennon pretty HAD to take amp w/his syd everytime because he dosed so often), but I waited a solid 9-10 hrs after taking my last addy before dropped that acid. Once again though I thought this what did me, until today when I read this thread of a guy who did a thumbprint and it sounded SO much like my experience, but maybe not AS intense. <br /><br />Now I don&#039;t know what to think...What do you guys think? Do you think he dosed me to the moon, or was it the addy? and for those people experienced enough to know, how much LSD do you think I took? or if it was the addy how much do think that was comparable to?

				Seems to me to be above 500mcg.&nbsp; Above 500mcg / at 500the is where most get so many visuals that it is impossible to even see your hand in front of your face.&nbsp;

				I also had a similar experience, dosing up at a birthday party.&nbsp; There was a guy there with sheets, and I asked how much for a few hits.&nbsp; He looked at me like I was retarded and said to open my mouth.&nbsp; I almost wish I hadn&#039;t.&nbsp; This motherfucker tore off a large corner of a sheet and stuck it on my tongue.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have a clue how many hits it was.<br /><br />In retrospect, I should have taken it out and looked at it.&nbsp; Maybe I did and just don&#039;t remember, idk.&nbsp; But around 30 minutes later, I felt restless as fuck and couldn&#039;t get comfortable.&nbsp; I knew it was going to be a long night.&nbsp; I lost my fucking mind in that hotel room, jesus fucking christ.&nbsp; I had insanely strong visuals, the most amazing geometric fractal patterns splashed all across the white walls, growing out of control any time I stopped to really look at them.&nbsp; Colors became more vivid than I have ever experienced on any psychedelic, then washed together until I couldn&#039;t focus on anything at all.&nbsp; Everything was just a hot, glowing mess of shimmering technicolor.<br /><br />Vision got pretty pixelated near the peak.&nbsp; My thoughts were running so fast I couldn&#039;t even string together a whole sentence before i would lose it.&nbsp; A friend and I (who was also tripping), had a weird experience that I still can&#039;t explain.&nbsp; It was like we read each other&#039;s minds.&nbsp; I lost all sense of where I was.&nbsp; No concept of my town, my state, my family, my life... I was not at all prepared for the ego loss I got handed that night.&nbsp; For a while, I literally thought I had died, or was about to.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was a very difficult trip, I had a couple of panic attacks... I remember being so drained after I peaked.&nbsp; I could barely move, barely talk.&nbsp; I thought I was never going to stop tripping.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad that I could experience something so intense and walk away from it, but I&#039;ll be damned if I ever take LSD so casually again. :P

				I had dosed many times before, but only a few since.&nbsp; It was definitely a bad trip.&nbsp; I still can&#039;t fully regret it; like I said, it was an amazing, life-changing experience.&nbsp; But it did leave me with a feeling that there wasn&#039;t much more to do or see on L.<br /><br />I had the same moment of knowing it was waaaay too much, but I don&#039;t know if I lost consciousness.&nbsp; There are gaping holes in my memory of the night, though.&nbsp; I remember driving on the interstate at one point.&nbsp; Apparently we all couldn&#039;t take the tiny hotel room anymore, and took off. :P

				I once ate a 10 strip and licked the sheet... Terrible idea.<br /><br />Most intense experience of my life. (probably the worst experience as well)<br /><br />I&#039;ll keep it short... <br /><br />I lost my sense of reality. I thought I was Jesus, being crucified, and feeling the sins of the world. Terribly intense emotions... I could not see anything but hallucinations. I was somehow transported to an alien planet filled with super small aliens and I was welcome there. The alien planet was kind of a safe haven for me... I would apparently hide under my covers and stop hyperventilating when I was in the alien world.<br /><br />My friend turned into the fat guy from the movie Spawn. He also turned into a pool of blood and drained off into the floor. <br /><br />For some reason my friend told me that I fried my brain and that I was going to be like Ozzy Osbourne for the rest of my life. This is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I was already afraid that I was trapped in an alternate universe, then he said that shit... I believed him. I fell out onto the floor, started crying and hyperventilating again, demons were all around me, and my friend once again looked like the fat guy off of Spawn. He was trying to reassure me but I could not understand what he was saying. I assumed this meant that my brain was toast.<br /><br />Yea... It was a hellish time. I wanted to die. There is a lot more to the story but I don&#039;t really want to type it up. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t touched acid since.&nbsp; :-\

				Wow, some pretty intense stories.<br /><br />The best acid I&#039;ve ever done was my first time, just one hit.&nbsp; But pretty much everything had this glowing neon going around it and when I was looking at people sometimes it would turn into &quot;old time movie reel vision&quot; and it was so fucking sweet.. I would love to get to &quot;old time movie reel vision&quot; again at some point.<br /><br />Not sure on the ug, but the guy said they were &quot;decent.&quot;&nbsp; I was also by myself for most of the night at a bar.. lol.. walked around the parking lot quite a bit and had to call my sister to pick me up.&nbsp; Then had to get someone to walk in the bar with me bc it was too intense so I could get my debit card from the bartender and quickly scribble a line as my name on the receipt and get the hell outta there.<br /><br />When my sister got done driving me home I walked out to some lawnchairs at like 330AM and swirled the clouds in the sky with my finger.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; <br /><br />I really want to know how dosed that hit was because I have taken what I believe to be 200ug from &quot;theMunchies&quot; and still really didn&#039;t get back to that world.. although it was still fun
