				Atlantis started with a tiny commission, kept hiking it up until it was about the same as here, and still they couldn&#039;t keep the lights on. It showcases the tremendous challenges of keeping a site like this operational.<br /><br />For all the shit DPR got for hiking commissions, I&#039;m now thinking it was a prudent move to keep Fortress SR steaming ahead.

				I have never used Atlantis but the last I knew their commission fees were 1% on large orders.&nbsp; What did they increase that number to?

				They pretty much adopted SRs fees at the end. A bit lower, but nothing worth migrating over for. It was a well-designed site, much more user-friendly and feature rich than this place, so I feel it&#039;s worth giving DPR his dues since he&#039;s the only one to successfully navigate all this over the years.

				The only benefit of a &#039;well designed&#039; site, is that dumb people are better enabled to use it. Silk Road isn&#039;t difficult to use if you have half a brain between your ears, and it was always the superior site by far. Atlantis just tried to appeal to the wrong market and failed.<br /><br />Just like in the legend, the city sunk beneath the sea.
