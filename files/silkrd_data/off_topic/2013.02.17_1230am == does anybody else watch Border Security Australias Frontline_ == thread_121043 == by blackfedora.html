				The show is generally funny to watch. Sometimes I sit there thinking &quot;damn, I wish those drugs were mine&quot; :(<br /><br />Too many travelers are just plain fucking retarded in terms of ticking &quot;no&quot; on the declaration card versus what is actually in their bags. <br /><br />In saying that, I came back from NL a while ago with 3 little bottles of vodka with marijuana seeds inside and they didn&#039;t see them while searching my bags, although a friend at the next inspection area had his same bottles taken away. Although he got a taser back into Australia and no one was none-the-wiser.

				It&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Lately, it seems like every time I hear of some big drug bust, it&#039;s in Oz.&nbsp; And, there was that SR bust - I think the ONLY SR bust - down there.&nbsp; They&#039;ve got bugs up their asses for smuggled drugs.

				Dude, you have mad karma.&nbsp; I am impressed!<br /><br />Well, I&#039;m in the US, and we&#039;re supposed to be the world&#039;s only superpower, but I think we lost the war on drugs a long time ago.&nbsp; In fact, I think we should give up.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure most of our voters think that way too, at least they&#039;re starting to.

				+1 ya mate, but the war on drugs is absolute bullshit, i think the country needs to be more productive, stop giving a fuck about &quot;morals&quot; and more about money if were sell shitloads of crazy that would create so many agricultural jobs, it wud bring so much money tax that shit, although some ppl still wudnt buy i wud much rather buy my weed cheap and taxed than wait monts for my bud to grow, also i feel like it is just like the 1930&#039;s prohibition of course theres gonna be violence because the only people controlling that shit is thugs, cartels, .ect , bst way to win the war on drugs is steal their consumer base

				Yeah, I totally agree.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t help that the Religious Right has veto power in one of the two major political parties in the US.&nbsp; And, it&#039;s a big money scheme for local LE.&nbsp; They keep a large percentage of any money they seize, the value of any property, and the tax value of any drugs seized.&nbsp; So, like, I live in a pretty rural area, but the sheriff&#039;s office has a crazy-equipped SWAT team and narcotics department because of the big busts.&nbsp; It&#039;s a money game.&nbsp; Legalization would end that, so of course the establishment is against it.<br /><br />+1 back, brother.

				thats the point, its all a money game, why should the government choose what we can and cant put inside our own bodies, we pay taxes in a *free Country* and we still cant do as we wish, this country is turning into absolute shit, when shit hits the fan ima put my tin foil hat on and haul ass down to Somalia or Malaysia
