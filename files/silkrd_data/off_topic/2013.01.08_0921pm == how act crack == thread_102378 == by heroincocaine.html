				Oh no, that must be some bad stuff if it has you that high!&nbsp; LOL OP, what is your question?&nbsp; That is probably the least intelligible string of phrases on the internet.&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks like what I get when I copy and paste some text in Japanese into a free online translator, but somehow it makes even less sense. <br /><br />If you speak a different language than English I apologize, but maybe you should try posting your question in your native language, there are a lot of people who speak other languages on here.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />LMAO @ the responses this thread.

First time or repeated use?<br />Or are you talking about comedown?<br />I suggest you stop using and go get some sleep.&nbsp; <br />

				Don&#039;t worry, after you have taken the crack and got really high maybe some time has passed and now the effects have worn off.<br />Now you have no stimulant drugs in your system, you feel tired and are &#039;crashing&#039;.<br />Judging by your username, maybe you have opiates in your system, maybe this is why you are tired.<br />Maybe you just need more crack.<br />It is normal for people to feel tired from time to time, Otherwise nobody would ever sleep.<br />Without sleep people become deranged monsters and this is no good for anyone.<br />I believe it is me pushen!

				I don&#039;t have any experience with crack but I read a lot, it appears you have the classic symptoms of a &#039;crack comedown&#039; symptoms include extreme tiredness and depression, you have two choices either the sensible route of calming down and going to sleep, melatonin is beneficial for inducing sleep as is valium, or you can ask Bruce who is very knowledgeable about benzos for a recommendation, the alternative is to have another crack and feel high again, but keep in mind this will bring you back down to where you are now. Comedowns are awful, and I&#039;ve heard crack comedowns are one of the worst, I wish you all the best overcoming it.
