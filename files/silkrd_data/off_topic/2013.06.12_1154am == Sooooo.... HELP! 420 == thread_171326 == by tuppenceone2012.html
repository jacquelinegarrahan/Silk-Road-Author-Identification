				I just harvested my hydro batch last month. Honestly I never really heard about sugar solution. I have heard of molasses additives that are supposed to sweeten up the buds. I used some store bought molasses additive from my nutrient line and it made my ak47 spectacular. Well, I also give props to my nutrient line since every nute was amazing. I am on the growing forums hardcore and never read anywhere of anyone using sugar. I would stay away from that. Use rollitup.org ***clearnet warning*** to help you get all the information you desire.

				I think so, my AK-47 when ground smells citrus like. Meanwhile the grow previous to my last, with the same genetics, did not have that smell at all. Plus, the trichromes extended to the tips of my sugar leaves on my most recent grow. It looked like there was a blizzard in my grow room. Haha. Good luck my friend.

				You add sugars to help feed microbial life when growing organic. <br /><br />Plants do not uptake sugars directly. It is a myth giving your plants sugars will increase bud size. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;When using organic products such as Advanced Nutrients Piranha and tarantula. voodoo juice... Adding sugars will help feed these microbes which in turn will break down organic matter in to something that is useable by your plants. <br /><br />Same thing when growing organic and using manures. If you are growing using chemical based nutrients that are already readily available for the plant giving the plants sugars is a waste of time.<br /><br />Some of the products I mentioned may have changed over the years..&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I used the mollasses within my hydro system. Took two years for my 11 dollar pump to fail. Everyone that does hydro has to clean their system somehow. If you just let it go then it is your own fault things go bad.
