				Have no idea, just got that message and that was it. <br />Sucks because he&#039;s one of the best vendors on SR price wise and quantity wise, hope everything works out

				Yeah I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s it.&nbsp; Alternatively he may have run his mouth about selling on SR and the wrong people heard about it and word kept running...

				I think it may have been through f2f that he got in trouble, I don&#039;t see it being because of SR.<br />He always used gpg, all his packages were extremely safe and just look at his feedback, far from sloppy (on here that is) <br />But who knows, I&#039;m just sad he&#039;s gone

				I can tell you with absolutely certainty.<br />They always take the PC in any raid. They&#039;ll take the fridge if its got enough beer in it.<br />They apparently like to collect butane lighters too.<br />Awarded to the department = some fucking pig playing black ops on your seized pc<br />I&#039;m pretty sure some people have been sourcing from their Xbox360 and PS3 too..<br /><br />I think hardly any buyer uses PGP. These people aren&#039;t tech savy enough for this very technological age we all live in. Its all iPod and Facebook. Welcome to the Darkwebs. &quot;You&#039;ve got Drugs&quot;<br /><br />Or BCBudman just wanted to disappear for whatever reason and sent you that message so you&#039;d go away and leave him alone. Who knows
