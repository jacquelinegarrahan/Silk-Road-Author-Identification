				I&#039;ve been thinking about it and even though I used to be completely against joining the military, I recently thought that being a military medic would really help me grow in life and I probably wouldnt have to hurt anyone innocent. What do you think? It solves so many problems like paying for college, and in my case better luck with women. They like a guy in uniform, right? <br /><br />Have any of you been in the military? Do you think this will actually help with women?<br />

				Age and maturity will help with women.&nbsp; Not just your age and maturity, but the age and maturity of the women you are chasing.<br /><br />I had terrible luck with women until I turned 30.&nbsp; At that age, women are looking more at the big picture (family, friendship, etc.) than just coolness factor, looks, etc.&nbsp; Can any women verify?<br /><br />I was not in the military, although I do have enormous respect for vets and active military.&nbsp; I think joining the military will help you grow and give you a future.&nbsp; My 2 cents.

				I&#039;ve not been in the military, but my family goes back generations in service.<br />I was always pressured to join, but I chose not to because I grew up moving from place to place and didn&#039;t want to anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m tired of boxes, even 20 years later.<br /><br />The military will help you a lot in life though, it gives you discipline and respect for yourself.&nbsp; The confidence you will gain will be the number one thing that will get you women.&nbsp; Women love confidence.&nbsp; My last move I made living with my parents I conducted a social experiment.&nbsp; I decided to act like the assholes from my previous town who were always getting some... lo and behold, it was that easy.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have to be a complete asshole to get with chicks, but my &quot;confidence&quot; changed everything.&nbsp; I could even say stupid things like, &quot;Hey baby.&nbsp; I think you&#039;re pretty hot, you should come with me to my place. I&#039;m going to be there, and I think we could have a pretty good time.&quot;&nbsp; Worst pick up line ever, and she jumped on that like white on rice.&nbsp; I used a kind of swagger, and eye winking thing too.&nbsp; Totally cheesy.<br />Another time I danced with a chick, and I was like &quot;____ is your boyfriend? Whew!&nbsp; You should dump him and go out with me.&quot; like her boyfriend was a leper or something.&nbsp; She did it, right after the song we were dancing to. <br /><br />It worked on my wife too.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />The other thing the military will give you, is cash and some of the best benefits packages of any employer.<br />Only down side is you&#039;ll have to chill on the drugs until you&#039;re in for awhile.<br />I say, do it.

				Fuck joining the military!&nbsp; The last thing anyone needs is another depressed teenager in a foreign country with a gun.<br /><br />You just need some confidence MB, you&#039;re a lot smarter than you probably realize.&nbsp; <br /><br />College is a good idea, but don&#039;t feel like you need to go right away.&nbsp; I know many people who wish they waited a year, myself included.&nbsp; I went into college during a bad phase in life, and was too strung out freshman year to get any value out it.<br /><br />My suggestion, assuming you&#039;ve graduated high school, would be to move out (find a cheap sublet on craigslist) and work for a year.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t have to be a great job, just something that pays the bills.&nbsp; Use this time to get your life sorted out, figure out what you want to study, and save up a little money.&nbsp; You will be very inspired to do well in college after a year of the daily grind.&nbsp; Might need to take out some loans, and that sucks, but in-state tuition isn&#039;t usually too bad.

				I highly suggest joining the military of the nation which you currently reside.&nbsp; If you do join just be sure to stay on your P&#039;s and Q&#039;s and you will be fine.&nbsp; Do not consume illegal drugs or other substances banned my the military.<br /><br />You will develop and grow at an exponential rate while in the military if you take their teachings and make something of it.&nbsp; You will gain more discipline than you could ever imagine having.&nbsp; You will develop great leadership abilities when you are put in a leadership position, which will happen even for those that are the lowest rank.&nbsp; You will become responsible beyond any degree that you could imagine.&nbsp; You will learn to plan and prioritize.&nbsp; You will make many life long friends and connections while making many more life long enemies.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to everyone.&nbsp; You may not think that you could maintain the state of mind that one has in the military, but once you finish your initial training you will be able to do it and it will not be that bad!&nbsp; Also, you will have to come to grips with such things, such as fighting wars that you don&#039;t believe in... but when it comes time to fight that war you will recognize that you are fighting for no one other than the men and women next to you.&nbsp; You will not fight for any political ideas.&nbsp; You will not fight to further an agenda.&nbsp; God forbid, when the bullets start flying... you wont even fight for yourself... you will only fight for your brethren... and they will only fight for you... and it will be good.

				I would not say that exactly I looked at it as a game. More or less the idea is to break you down then build you back up to a point higher than where you started and only the first 2 weeks o boot camp are they that harsh they let up of course by then you are basicly used to it before you are done you come to enjoy it. I know that sounds nuts but its true.

				Joining the military may be one of many solutions to your problem. <br /><br />If women is the main issue though, I&#039;d focus more on money. <br /><br />And a long military career is not generally conducive to that aim.

				Good luck with this decision - just make sure you listen to what your heart tells you because this is a volatile question and you will/have receive very different responses.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what I can say - if I could have I would have joined the Marines, and EVERY single one of my friends or just people I knew that did join the military (17 total) are all 100% better off than those that didn&#039;t - with the exception of those that went to college and did well. <br /><br />Basically, if you&#039;re not going to go to college and do something with yourself, I recommend joining the military. Otherwise you will spend your 20&#039;s going from shit job to shit job, or you might get into a good factory - and in that case you are just as much of a drone as somebody in the military. You might not have been down to these choices 15-30 years ago, but now with the job market being the way it is you most definitely need a career, and being in the military, even if you don&#039;t make it a career, will open up other possibilities.<br /><br />As far as being programmed, well, I know folks that had no problem letting that bullshit slide right through them - especially after they were off active duty. Some, however, are really prone to latching on to the behavior programming, and do things like &#039;&#039;fold my clothes before I get into bed every night&#039;&#039;. It just depends on you, and how smart you are, and also how much of an individual you are. Some people hold onto it for longer, and others don&#039;t - it just depends. <br /><br />I hope this helped,<br />ECO

He says DO NOT JOIN. I say remember it is your life your decision you do what you think is best and never let anyone make decisions for you. I know that this sounds strange as if you do decide to enlist then a lot of decisions will be made for you remember though you knew when you went in what you where in for and you agreed to do it so in a way it is your decision. I enjoyed myself I got to go to Korea and live there for a year. I went to several other places in the U.S. I served during the first gulf war or Desert Nam part one. did not deploy. You may never deploy or you may deploy often or deploy once then never again even if you deploy you may be in the rear with the gear and never hear a shot fired in anger let alone see combat or you could be on the front line shooting and scooting. There is no benefit in worrying about what will be for what will be will be. As for what my fine friend here said, well people have been saying that since the Vietnam conflict heck even before. Men like me, men that serve we serve so that men like him do not have to, so he can say whatever he likes without fear of government prosecution.

				Hi there.<br />It IS of course your decision on what you do choose, but allow me to give advice on what i know.<br />A friend of mine was in the army for a long time, albiet an &quot;old&quot; friend.&nbsp; He ended up serving with the det and doing some seriously dodgy stuff in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; <br />Even now after ten years or so outside the army he still has nightmares about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;He regrets things he did, and when he first left he lost his wife and was drinking heavily.&nbsp; He went on a strong course of anti-depressants and this helped somewhat.&nbsp; <br />This is a guy who actually wanted to do his part for his country and it royally fucked him over.<br />He knows fellow soldiers who, when they left the army at the same time, got dumped on and ended up either homeless, on heroin or both.<br />I actually wanted to join the army a few years back.&nbsp; Life got shit and i needed something with career prospects.<br />He showed me a picture of a carpel spider, i think it was called, and its the size of your fucking hand.<br />Just be warned, if you join the army, they WILL send you to shit places with bugs and fuck knows what diseases.<br />The training will NOT be everything you dreamed, it wont turn you into Jason Bourne.<br />From what one of the previous posters stated, life is survival enough.<br />I agree with him totally.&nbsp; Get through this shit.&nbsp; It is more to be a man and true to your own nature, accept who and what you are, without running away from your problems.<br />It sounds like im having a go at you.&nbsp; But im not.&nbsp; I have just learned from my past experiences, and mistakes, and learned how to walk around with my head held high.<br />But with whatever you decide, good luck and i wish you all the best.

				Yup, its all about MONEY.<br />As a soldier, sure you get to learn discipline and hard-work.<br />But your #1 Job is to kill brown people for the Military Industrial Complex to get rich.<br />This has absolutely nothing to do about FREEDOM.<br /><br />I love my friends who are Marines and Soldiers. And I have a lot of them.<br />3 of my buddies died in Afghanistan for fucking nothing. No lie. That is why I have a strong opinion. Just got back from a funeral in March. <br />The Marines who did come back confided in me and told me its all bullshit. <br />Their missions were not what they signed up for. They believed they were bring a democracy to Iraq. They believed they were hunting Osama. They believed they were going to exterminate the Taliban as quickly and efficiently as possible. <br />Guess what? It was all a fucking lie and the blood is on their hands. Poor fucking souls.<br />I reassure those guys everytime the subject comes up that they did nothing wrong. To have no guilt, to not feel worthless.<br />But that don&#039;t help.<br />Look at the god damn SUICIDE RATES.<br /><br />And ecopaktm telling you that his friends are better off, FUCK NO.<br />They might have a nice blue-collar job, but let me tell you, they are mentally scarred.<br />Anyone who has served in Iraq or Afghanistan has come home a completely different person.<br />Usually introverted until they get completely wasted and turn violent or extremely emotional telling them how guilty they feel for kicking Iraqi families out of their homes to search for weapons that did not exist. For being ordered to fire the .50 CAL into a crowd of people. <br />For seeing their brothers explode or bleed to death in an effort to take control of a mountain town that would be used as a strategic foothold against the Taliban only to learn that when they got back home that town was left by the Marines only to be have control taken back by the Taliban.<br />In other words, their best fucking friends DIED FOR NOTHING.<br /><br />As I said, do not join unless you want to listen to tpebop who is a Gulf War Veteran who never saw combat and is supporting the actions of the United States government who sees him as a criminal.<br /><br />Hey tpebop, hate to shatter your reality but your service in the first Gulf War didn&#039;t do shit for my free speech and the U.S. Government will lock you up in a second if they found out you were buying drugs on this site. God damn is your position ironic.<br />

				It just seemed that there was potential to bash each other personally - and that didn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; Kalos was flaming - surely you can see that.&nbsp; These are some strong opinions and Tpebop kept it about him and his decision.&nbsp; <br /><br />Brave New World has excellent points, especially the one about getting locked up for buying drugs on SR.&nbsp; Oh, and the suicide rate.&nbsp; I respect his opinion too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps I am out of my league with commenting.&nbsp; I know people who have joined, former and currently active (don&#039;t we all).&nbsp; I have respect for them.&nbsp; The ones I know have their shit together.&nbsp; They have jobs.&nbsp; They have a future.&nbsp; If I were out of options, I would consider the military (although maybe not after seeing these posts).&nbsp; I can admit that my perspective may be skewed because I don&#039;t know any dead soldiers.

				Thanks Kalos,&nbsp; I did reread and you are right!!!&nbsp; My apologies!!!<br /><br />This has been one of the most enlightening threads I&#039;ve read in a long while - maybe ever.&nbsp; Clearly my perspective was extremely limited.&nbsp; I am glad to have seen all of these opinions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Often when you have differing strong opinions, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; However, with the military, this seems to be untrue.&nbsp; Is it possible that there is no middle ground?&nbsp; You either see action and have the potential to be fucked in the head for life (or dead) OR you don&#039;t see action and you learn skills and leadership and become more employable?&nbsp;

				My brother tried to join the military and was rejected for a reason I don&#039;t remember. My mother cried to the recruiter (?) and he told my mom, &quot;One day you will thank me that your son can&#039;t join the military&#039;.<br /><br />I believe in karma too much and prefer to live a humble life with positivity and action. By action I mean, if there&#039;s a problem I will not sit around and cry. I might hurt for a bit but action needs to be taken. Admit you have a drug problem, get your shit together, and STEP IT UP.

I like how you who never served yourself is going to &quot;shatter my reality&quot; I am only sharing my own personal experience and my own opinions. Another thing man I am well over 40 years old so I have some life experience. As for the U.S. Government I do not know nor did I then support the actions of the federal government. I do not support the current administration and its war activities. I do however support the men and women tasked to fight these illegal wars. I get the feeling that you subscribe to some far left ideology and some of what I say goes against that ideology so you assume I must be some far right wing go go war nut I am not. I am a registered libertarian an do not buy into the false left right bull shit. The people behind all the crap you site are the same ones keeping the false left right bs going they need us to fight each other so we will be too busy to fight them. As for Irony, yes I am a silk road user but at one time I worked drug interdiction task force. Keeping drugs out of the country out of the hands of people like me. What I did then was my job and there was no more wrong with that then there is with what I am doing now. I wish you the best man believe it or not I am on the same side as you we just do not agree %

I like how you who never served yourself is going to &quot;shatter my reality&quot; I am only sharing my own personal experience and my own opinions. Another thing man I am well over 40 years old so I have some life experience. As for the U.S. Government I do not know nor did I then support the actions of the federal government. I do not support the current administration and its war activities. I do however support the men and women tasked to fight these illegal wars. I get the feeling that you subscribe to some far left ideology and some of what I say goes against that ideology so you assume I must be some far right wing go go war nut I am not. I am a registered libertarian an do not buy into the false left right bull shit. The people behind all the crap you site are the same ones keeping the false left right bs going they need us to fight each other so we will be too busy to fight them. As for Irony, yes I am a silk road user but at one time I worked drug interdiction task force. Keeping drugs out of the country out of the hands of people like me. What I did then was my job and there was no more wrong with that then there is with what I am doing now. I wish you the best man believe it or not I am on the same side as you we just do not agree %<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So if I am a human trafficker, is that ok because it&#039;s my job?&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing you mostly associate morality with legality, and since war is violence that is state-sanctioned, you have no problem with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Related discussions have happened on this site, like the &quot;is buying heroin/coke immoral?&quot; threads.&nbsp; I agree it&#039;s a fine line, the teller at a bank for instance should not be prosecuted because the bank defrauded people.&nbsp; But soldiers on the other hand play a very crucial role in the atrocities of war;&nbsp; I would exempt them on the basis that they&#039;re most often kids forced into it by economic circumstance, but still, it&#039;s not something to be proud of.<br /><br />

				This is the SCARY thing about joining the army.&nbsp; Its like its own little private government.&nbsp; IF you fuck up, you are sanctioned by a MILITARY court of law, not civvy street law.<br />Its like if you do something wrong in London.&nbsp; London is one of the few cities in the world that has its own ambulance service, fire service and worst of all, its own metropolitan police force.<br />Remember the riots where that guy got pushed down and ended up dead because of head injury?<br />Every single police officer had his badge number concealed.&nbsp; And that my friends is against the law.<br />And what happened?, a fucking slap on the wrist, thats all.<br /><br />IF you are going to be a part of any &quot;fraternity&quot;, because that is basically what they are, you have to think about not just the actions of yourselves, but the actions of others and the repercussions that ensue because of them.<br />So you really want to be a part of a &quot;family&quot; where backstabbing and cover ups are a way of daily life?<br />If you think the army is any different, your in for a shock.

				Not sure why you say the Air Force is not an option as far as I know they have jobs in the medical field. The Navy would be less intense boot camp wise. I would never want to serve at sea so that&#039;s my issue. If you are cool with long times at sea then the navy is fine except for that gay ass sailor suit they wear.

				Yeah from what i understand if you really want to progress career wise, id say go for the navy.<br />Who knows, navy seal or even black ops might be in your future.<br />Just be prepared to spend MONTHS if not years trapped on a tiny, claustrophobic submarine with nothing but smelly guys to look at.&nbsp; You will have gay moments that other sailors take to their graves with them.<br />Its a bit like prison only its your job and you get paid shit money.<br /><br />
