				Mostly porn from what I understand, the only .onions I ever go on besides SR are anonchan and talk.masked, and even that is rare. I basically see TOR as a tool for buying drugs and nothing else, though that may change some day if the police state gets bad enough

				Freenet and I2P do have different sites, but I have never heard of any drug trade on either of them. Freenet is pretty much pedo central (even compared to Tor), not sure if there is anything worthwhile on I2P its really fucking small (it has like 5 thousand users). <br /><br />Tor is mostly used for surfing legal porn and getting out around firewalls, but it also has numerous other users. Tor has about half a million people using it at any given time, I doubt they are all drug dealers and pedophiles.

				Check out the onion Core. It&#039;s a directory. Some pretty interesting shit on there by all accounts, only thing that I didn&#039;t go through is the porn and the Polish Pedophile/Pedophilia advocacy site..... Fuck that for a game of of rugby on a Sunday afternoon, I&#039;m all good for donkey shows, people who take dumps on each other and Eastern Europeans talking about how they like to touch kids.
