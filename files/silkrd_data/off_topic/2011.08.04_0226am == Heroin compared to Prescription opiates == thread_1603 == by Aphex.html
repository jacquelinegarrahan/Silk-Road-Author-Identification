				I have shot heroin in the past but I don&#039;t want to deal with H because the SR sellers are typically sketchy and I will be more inclined to shoot it. Also the last thing I need is an H dealer IRL because easy access to this drug is not something I want.<br /><br />I am interested in the scripts that would have comparable effects. Mainly high dose Oxycontin or Dilaudid . I have done decent(~30mg) doses of oxy but never got the euphoria I associate with H. I have never done high doses of oxy and never even been able to get my hands on dilaudid. Do either have enough effect to pack the punch that H does or do you think I will just be left feeling like I wasted money.<br /><br />

				Opana is pretty awesome. Oxymorphone is very strong as people said.<br /><br />Dillies are fun, but they have no legs at all. It&#039;s like crack. You can shoot through alot of 8mg&#039;ers in a day just to stay high, and that&#039;s just plain expensive. If people scripted it weren&#039;t so greedy, it&#039;d be alot more worth doing.<br /><br />I always go back to plain old Morphs. Morphs are great, but shooting them can be a bitch.<br /><br />Oxy 30s are pretty damn nice. two of those is comparable to a bag of H I&#039;d say, and they don&#039;t gel, super easy to shoot. :D

				For which were saying; nectar of god<br />oxymorphone or dilly.<br />I have a friend from US who told me that in the 80&quot;&nbsp; dilly powder were supplied in pharmacy. There were two forms; tablets and powder/with cuting agents.

				I&#039;d really like to see more opana on SR. I don&#039;t IV but insufflated opana is my new favorite after poppy tea. Poppy tea has such long beautiful legs.<br /><br />Aside from the gross factor, is plugged opana worth trying?

				well im no opiate expert by any means but i do intend to try some (dont know that ill go to the level of heroin but i may well try oxy) however while doing a bit of reading up on opiates too see just what was available and worthwhile i stumbled across this on wiki<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine (6-MDDM) is an opiate analogue that is a derivative of hydromorphone, where the 6-ketone group has been replaced by methylene. It has sedative and analgesic effects.<br /><br />6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine is a potent Î¼-opioid agonist, 80x stronger than morphine. Compared to morphine it has a faster onset of action and similar duration of effects. It produces around the same degree of respiratory depression as morphine, but less inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. Animal studies show it to be a potent analgesic which produces significant analgesic effects even at low doses which produce comparatively few side effects, however it has never been developed for medical use in humans.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />im surprised no clandestine chemists have given that one a go, although i suppose it depends on the difficulty of the synth, my chemistry isnt of that high a level

				After I got a few pharmaceuticals IV&#039;d, I could never imagine going back to the &quot;dirty&quot; high that is H. The only comparable, however, in terms of length and euphoric, in my humble opinion, is dilaudid. And I don&#039;t mean, pill crushing then IV&#039;ing. I mean, ampules/hopsital administration. :) Too bad none of those amps are sold around here though.

				Opana IV&#039;d is about 4 times as strong as oxycodone/oxycontin. Its hard to find the IR&#039;s though so you end up with the ER&#039;s which have that stupid timerX shit in it. It is still possible to shoot these with a little know how and some prep. <br />Dilaudid is where its at in my opinion. 8mg of that in a spoon, and then in your vein you are gonna be one happy fuckin camper! I absolutely love dilaudid. The rush is alot stronger than H and it doesnt last as long. H is a bit smoother and is kind of mellow. <br />Really, opana, Dilaudid, and heroin all have their pros and cons but all of them are amazing as far as Im concerned!

				Thanks for the recommendation everyone. Opana is great, railed 3-5mgs and I feel great. Thanks for the fatty food tip CP.<br /><br />Seems like the perfect opiate to me lasts a while and is very euphoric might try some dilies one day as well.
