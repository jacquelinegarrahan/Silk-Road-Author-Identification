				I was thinking wouldnt it be good to have a grow forum here on silkroad community<br />Forums, what does everyone else think?<br /><br />It would allow vendors to show off there products a lot better<br />It would allow buyers to see how thier vendor grows thier perticular Product .. <br />For example Cannabis is a very interesting plant to be grown<br />It needs a lot of care And attention.. A lot of money has to go into it.. A lot of research<br />Risk, and much more..<br /><br /><br />I think having a place on the silkroad forum would also attract a lot more people to this forum <br />Andfor all the right reasons<br />Growing your own is very satisfying... How ever I know very well its not easy to keep quite about it ;)<br />&nbsp;I think the privacy of Tor and the potential profit big growers would Make on the main site selling there own grown product would attract more of the right people<br /><br />I know I would love to see a vendors product been grown from seed to harvest<br />Maybe other products as well home grown poppys for.H <br />Maybe the manufactoring process a pure cocaine seller used to make his product<br /><br />Obviously it wouldnt be wise to give off much information on the amount a vendor has stocked<br />Im sure theres ways to avoid that.. <br /><br />Anyway, let.me.know.what you all think? Any mods? DPR? Will be much appreciated<br />
