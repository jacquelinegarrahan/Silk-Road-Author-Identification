				I just read about how insurance companies are stealing from us. I want to return the favor.<br /><br />I just bought an expensive laptop and it&#039;s insured for theft. I want to steal my own laptop and then collect $$$ from my insurance. However, they require you to file a police report before they pay up. So I want to convincingly stage a robbery, without police getting suspicious that the report is fake. <br /><br />So my question is: how do you stage a robbery and make it look convincing? Can you punch yourself in the face, and make it look real?<br />

				Head out of town for the night, have a buddy come over break a few windows, kick a door in, and ruffle up the house a little bit. If you have house insurance too it&#039;s a win/win situation. Just make sure not to get caught selling your own stolen laptop! also make sure your buddy doesn&#039;t leave anything incriminating behind, you don&#039;t want him getting busted for b&amp;e!

				2 years ago I filed a police report after they broke my car&#039;s window and took a bag with my ID, driver&#039;s license and some other things.It was very easy and actually I lied about the exact place that happened because I might had to explain why I was there... BUT I don&#039;t live in your country probably and I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s any difference. Also I know for a fact that insurance companies have their people to investigate cases like that and you don&#039;t want them to find out what happened, in that case they won&#039;t just refuse your refund. You should be very careful. <br /><br />Warning - while you were typing a new reply has been posted. You may wish to review your post.<br /><br />I would highly recommend not involving your residence in this, it will perplex things a LOT and you don&#039;t want cops giving much attention to it. Stick with something like car window broken etc. Also you didn&#039;t see anyone, keep it simple.

I have no experience with insurance fraud either, so bear that in mind. Your best bet would be a dive bar in a bad neighborhood. Have an accomplice actually break in and steal the laptop/gps whatever else you want &quot;stolen&quot;. Just be in the bar for 45 min- an hour at least, long enough to have a decent alibi established. Have your friend just cut off contact with you for the next couple weeks, maybe even months until things settle down, someone you trust to hold onto your stolen goods. Maybe just go ahead and replace the stuff with the insurance money, then sell your old laptop on here or through a third party/craigslist.

				dude, don&#039;t wound yourself over this.&nbsp; if we were talking about a million dollars, then i&#039;d say some physical harm would be worth it...but not for a laptop.&nbsp; if you&#039;re determined to do this you can fake it getting stolen without hurting yourself.&nbsp; its also naive of you to think you could do it yourself.&nbsp; you haven&#039;t seen nearly as many wounded people as the cops or EMTs or ER nurses.&nbsp; i guarantee they&#039;d know something was up.&nbsp; if you insist on going that route, the only way to do it is get some of your boys to kick the shit out of you.&nbsp; i&#039;m telling you, it just won&#039;t look real unless it IS real.<br /><br />hey, here&#039;s an idea:<br /><br />go to a starbucks and set up your laptop around a lot of people.&nbsp; get up and go to the bathroom, and have your friend steal it in front of everyone while you&#039;re there so you have a bunch of witnesses.&nbsp; &quot;hey, did you see someone come in here and take my laptop?&quot;&nbsp; they all say &quot;yes&quot; and they aren&#039;t going anywhere, so the cops will come, write the paper and you can collect.&nbsp; this involves a good deal of acting though.&nbsp; you have any background with improv?

				I appreciate the replies people.<br /><br />I&#039;ll double check my insurance policy, but I believe it doesn&#039;t cover valuable items left in an unmanned/unguarded vehicle.<br /><br />I&#039;ve considered a few options and I believe a mugging in a dark alley is the best story to use (because I know some good spots for that, and it leaves little physical evidence behind). I&#039;m going to claim a guy came out of nowhere, punched me, ripped away my bag and ran off. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92346.msg650528#msg650528">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on December 08, 2012, 11:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">its also naive of you to think you could do it yourself.&nbsp; you haven&#039;t seen nearly as many wounded people as the cops or EMTs or ER nurses. i guarantee they&#039;d know something was up. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is also what worries me (and the reason I started this topic). The paramedics won&#039;t be involved for a blue eye, but I&#039;ll have to call the cops and file a report in order to pull it off. The question is, will the police notice that the &#039;beating&#039; is self-inflicted? How do you punch yourself? I&#039;ve never done that before.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=92346.msg650528#msg650528">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on December 08, 2012, 11:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">if you insist on going that route, the only way to do it is get some of your boys to kick the shit out of you.&nbsp; i&#039;m telling you, it just won&#039;t look real unless it IS real.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah I&#039;ve considered that option. The problem is that the people I know either can&#039;t throw a decent punch, or I don&#039;t trust them enough to not rat me out... or both. Also the fewer people involved, the better (means I won&#039;t have to share the loot).<br /><br />I realize it requires some effort and planning, but it isn&#039;t impossible, is it? There are people who get away with a complete pot shop in their basement or attic. Why would this be too hard to pull off?

				Please do not do that.&nbsp; I used to work for a BIG insurance company and was friends with the manager of our fraud investigation unit.&nbsp; It was an entire floor of people who worked tirelessly to catch people and have them prosecuted to the full extent of the law.&nbsp; Most of the people they caught had plans that many would have called fool proof.&nbsp; Pretty much every single claim is treated like a potential fraudulent claim, even the CSR&#039;s know what to look for.&nbsp; Insurance companies do not want to pay, nothing is too small.<br /><br />I wasn&#039;t in fraud and I could easily determine just by reading reports and notes, that a claim was fraudulent.&nbsp; I would flag it and send it to an investigator.&nbsp; That wasn&#039;t even in my job description, it just is something almost anyone in the insurance industry can do.&nbsp; Imagine how easy it is for people who are trained to spot these types of things.<br /><br />The ideas you have are not new, or unique.&nbsp; They happen every single day.&nbsp; People stage car accidents, they will try to force an accident with someone driving a rental car so that they can sue the pants off of them, people smash in windows of their cars, stage robberies, have a friend steal their car, burn down a failing business, etc

What your describing is something that rookie criminals will fuck up often. You need more experience committing crime before you start committing crime with a paper trail that directly causes you to have contact with the police. <br /><br />It is fairly ez to get away with insurance fraud but you need to understand alot of things that most people have no experience at all dealing with like how the police will investigate and what method is best to achieve your goal, of getting money.

				if you are going to commit insurance fraud just for 1 &#039;expensive&#039; laptop then you are probably retarded.<br /><br /><br />first of all, think of a legit story (keep it simple) , like you think they came in the back/laundry door, took items, left garage open then left. you woke up at your usual time came downstairs and noticed shit was missing and doors were open.<br />remember and memorize this story like it actually happened.<br /><br />go hide a few items that a robber would take, keys, laptop, ipods, handbags,&nbsp; powertools etc.<br /><br />call the cops are usual time of just after you get up for work and tell them the story, wait for them to come do forensics and reports and questioning<br />then call up insurance.<br />they will hire fraud investigators, and you will have to run through the story with them MULTIPLE times, and you will have to show them into your house and explain it to them face to face and show them how you think it happened.<br />this is to see if your story changes. and they can pick up if you are lying face to face.<br /><br />if you pass all their tests, you will then need to produce reciepts for all items you are claiming for,<br /><br />only do it, if you are 100% sure you can go through their interrogation without changing your story. once you start, you have to commit the entire way, or else you will be caught out and charged with fraud, which means no insurance, or bank loans or anything else finance related for life.<br /><br />its probably not worth it. since i had a mate who tried it, and got caught out.<br /><br />probably easier going on a holiday to asia and claiming it got stolen, can pay the cops there for a police report. and process it through travel insurance which costs fuck all anyway,<br /><br />

				Thank you for the advice and your words of caution. I&#039;m reading all your posts carefully and I take your points into consideration.<br /><br />Let&#039;s brainstorm about what would happen if I were to try this. If not for anything else, then just because I find it interesting.<br /><br />This is the story: I went to the library and afterwards I&#039;m walking home. When I get home my laptop is gone and I have some bruises and a black eye.<br /><br />You are the insurance company. <br /><br />What steps would you take to investigate my claims?<br />How are you going to proof foul play?<br /><br />And now I&#039;m thinking about this. What if somebody actually does get mugged? Is there a risk that insurance companies don&#039;t believe the story and try to get that person prosecuted?

If I understood your post correctly, their primary method of investigation would be to make me tell the same story over and over again, so they can look for mistakes and inconsistencies. Was that also how your buddy got caught?<br /><br />What other things can they do? Pull security tapes? Look for witnesses?<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve learned so far, if you try something like this, you should really think through your story, make sure all the details are right, and then stick to it. What do you guys think?

				Wouldn&#039;t it be easier to just say someone snatched your bag (it needs to be snatched - taken from you with violence to be robbery for most policies)? I&#039;ve known some people who&#039;ve done this and had no issues with insurance. Less details, less holes to be picked.

I&#039;m reading all your posts carefully and I take your points into consideration.<br /><br />Let&#039;s brainstorm about what would happen if I were to try this. If not for anything else, then just because I find it interesting.<br /><br />This is the story: I went to the library and afterwards I&#039;m walking home. When I get home my laptop is gone and I have some bruises and a black eye.<br /><br />You are the insurance company. <br /><br />What steps would you take to investigate my claims?<br />How are you going to proof foul play?<br /><br />And now I&#039;m thinking about this. What if somebody actually does get mugged? Is there a risk that insurance companies don&#039;t believe the story and try to get that person prosecuted?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Insurance will NOT cover it if you are not inside your home.&nbsp; Homeowner&#039;s insurance does not cover muggings.&nbsp; It insures items from fire, theft and weather related damage ONLY inside the home.<br /><br />Just trust me on this one, you do not want to mess around with this. I am guessing you are a college aged kid?&nbsp; We suspect them to be commiting fraud from the get go. They will figure it out by the way you speak and the patterns you make in your speech.&nbsp; The information that doesn&#039;t quite add up. The parts of the story that just seem a little too coincidental.&nbsp; <br /><br />They will have you speak on the phone to about 3 different people.&nbsp; The CSR who files the claim, the claim representative, and then the fraud examiner.&nbsp; Someone will meet you at your home to investigate and take pictures.&nbsp; They will take notes and ask you more questions.&nbsp; Then the CR will call you again.&nbsp; They will talk to your friends, your family, your teachers.&nbsp; They will talk to the officer who took the report.&nbsp; They will talk to everyone.&nbsp; They will get reports from neighbors.

				There are easier ways to make money.&nbsp; I think you can do some type of warranty claim on your hard drive of your laptop and turn it one that you bought off craigslist.&nbsp; Then sell the new one.&nbsp; No idea how that works, but I know people do stuff like that.

				This idea is stupid...<br /><br />... Theft is disgusting.<br /><br />If you want something in life, go get it - don&#039;t steal it off someone else.
