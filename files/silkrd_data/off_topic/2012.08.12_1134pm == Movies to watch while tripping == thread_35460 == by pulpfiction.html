				Curious what others have tried to watch while tripping. I&#039;ve never been one to sit through an entire film, and when I&#039;m tripping I&#039;m more of the outdoors type, but I tried The Wizard of Oz (horrible failure - heard munchkins singing for hours), Scream (worst decision of my life I believe - saw Ghostface for hours) and finally Fantastic Planet which had me lost in thought for days afterwards. <br /><br />Anyways, curious if anyone else actually enjoys watching television or movies tripping and if so, what?

				I&#039;ve had lots of fun watching television while tripping, but it&#039;s seldom had much to do with the content.&nbsp; It becomes next to impossible to follow a complicated plot, but subtle things (nuance, innuendo, etc.) come right to the surface (and can be hilarious).&nbsp; Unfortunately, bad acting becomes more obvious too, and many things on television seem hideously overplayed.&nbsp; But it&#039;s all amusing, regardless (though I tend to feel the need to do something else after ten or twenty minutes; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever watched anything all the way through).&nbsp; I&#039;d say: watch anything (except perhaps the news; that can be distressing).<br /><br />I&#039;ve only watched a couple of movies in a movie theater while tripping.&nbsp; One of them was wasted on me because it was very plot-centric and that part of it went right over my head (I don&#039;t even remember what movie it was).&nbsp; But the other was fantastic: City of Lost Children.&nbsp; That was many years ago; I recently rented the DVD, and was surprised to find that it was in French (with subtitles); I&#039;d completely forgotten that!&nbsp; But it&#039;s incredible, visually, and is more like a dream than a story, so you don&#039;t need to know what&#039;s happening to know what&#039;s happening.&nbsp; My one suggestion would be: try to time it so that you&#039;re well into your high when the movie starts, because the opening minutes ... well, I&#039;m not going to say more, so that I won&#039;t spoil it.<br /><br />But the reason I&#039;m posting a comment here is not TV or movies, but music videos by Stephan Malinowski.&nbsp; His YouTube channel is <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/smalin&quot;&gt;smalin&lt;/a&gt;</code><br />He invented this kind of music video to watch on acid, and for me, they&#039;re right on target.&nbsp; Everybody I&#039;ve shown them to so far has liked them (high or not), and the one guy I know who watched some on DMT said they were awesome.&nbsp; And they&#039;re short (just a few minutes, most of them); I&#039;ve sometimes watched the same one a few times in a row, and I&#039;ve never gotten bored in the middle.<br /><br />Malinkowski also has a channel with 3D videos (you need special glasses): <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/musanim3D&quot;&gt;musanim3D&lt;/a&gt;</code> (for me, the 3D effect is fun, but when I&#039;m high, the videos look pretty 3D even without the glasses).

Let your brain become completely absorbed in the film as you are coming up.&nbsp; If you are solo-tripping, use headphones because it will be that much more intense.&nbsp; This is not a list of &quot;eye-candy&quot; films.&nbsp; They may be eye candy, but they are much much more than just that.&nbsp; They relay to the viewer feelings, ideas, and visuals that will affect the rest of your trip, maybe more.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Dark City....Watch this film in a dark room at night.&nbsp; Sunlight kills the ambience.&nbsp; Saw it in the theater way back when and, oh ...fuck me.<br /><br />2. Apocalypse Now Redux... sure, you can watch the original, but if you like film, watch redux... better.&nbsp; This movie will pull you in and eat your soul.<br /><br />3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind... lighter fare than the first two, but still a very trippy story and very emotional.<br /><br />4. Donnie Darko...&nbsp; Tripping on LSD opens a wormhole in your soul.&nbsp; <br /><br />5. Sorry, drawing a blank.&nbsp; Don&#039;t want to just throw in a &quot;good&quot; film here.&nbsp; I will think of something....

These chemicals are what you make of them and how you best enjoy them, and it greatly varies from individual to individual.

				For me it depends what drug I&#039;m taking.<br /><br />If I&#039;m on a dissociative I find it really hard to watch trippy things because I notice it much more and try to tell what&#039;s me tripping and what&#039;s part of the program, I really enjoy TV series because I get sucked in and become part of the show (scrubs is great for this, anything without a laugh track).<br /><br />Been a long-ass time since I took acid/shrooms but I loved Yellow Submarine especially, and with it&#039;s recent blu-ray release I think it&#039;s time to buy some acid and give it a revisit :D

These chemicals are what you make of them and how you best enjoy them, and it greatly varies from individual to individual.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great point mate. They call them psychedelics for a reason, psyche being &quot;mind&quot; and delic (or delein in greek) being &quot;to manifest&quot;. They effects are a manifestation of your mind, not the drug itself. As for MDMA, I love the remark in PiHKaL about non users asking users what it does, and the response being &quot;nothing&quot;. So true when you really think about it.<br /><br />I personally love TV when I&#039;m tripping. Not for the whole trip or anything, but for an hour or so I can just sit and watch something, and try and understand it on a different level. If you can appreciate the art behind a great song, you should be able to appreciate an alternate medium as well.

				Yesterday I watched the film Alice (1988) while on mushrooms. I highly recommend this, especially if you like stop-motion animation.<br /><br />Clearnet clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmx5EG03oA<br /><br />It relies more on visual than verbal storytelling, which I think is good when tripping.

				I love to watch anime while I am tripping.<br /><br />Spirited away is a good one. Princess mononoke is another... the conflicts between good and evil are soo intense and epic in anime and its only intensified while tripping. I personally liked kenichi but some people would think its a little kiddish.. I also watched Twelve monkeys with Brad Pitt and that was also super intense and was fucking crazyyyyy

				I watched LoTR (not sure which part) once on MXE. It was crazy. I got so sucked into the storyline that I literally felt like I was there, experiencing the adventure with them :P Other than that, I enjoy watching cartoons and sitcoms while stoned as hell. The different perception and understanding (along with the giggles) make the shows so much more entertaining :)

				I&#039;ve always found Waking Life to be a good one. <br /><br />Lots of interesting ideas in there. It&#039;s great because there&#039;s no real narrative or plot, so you can just leave it on in the background and zone in and out whenever and still pick up something of worth. The artistic style is also good for visuals.

				I had a few friends convince me to watch &quot;the animatrix&quot; one night i was on like 5 hits. Ive always thought that the animatrix was some sort of shitty straight to dvd cartoon based on the matrix, but its actually pretty sweet. Six or seven short stories, each drawn by a different <br /><br />animator. Some are anime-style, while other stories are drawn in a more western style. Only thing is, it can get incredibly violent at some points, which can be unsettling to some. If u can handle the occaisional blood and gore though, I promise you will be in for a treat<br /><br />Ive never been a huge matrix nerd, but IMO, watching animatrix while tripping is better than seeing any of the live action matrix&#039;s while tripping, or sober.<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S: props to the dude who mentioned &quot;the holy mountain&quot;. Thats another crazy ass movie to see with your gal lucy

				Ok after some movie marathons of late revisiting some of my all time favourite movies, here is my list for movies high on trip potential:<br /><br />7) American Beauty (one of the most memorable characters Lester Burnham, on his journey of re-discovering himself through.. marijuana :P Amazing directing shot to totally fit with the amazing soundtrack. It&#039;s from beginning to end one very big depiction of what life is really about).<br />6) Truman Show (Character lives in one big production set where his whole world is fake and he is the star of the show. Needless to say it doesn&#039;t take much to extrapolate to the illusion of our reality. Unbeatable soundtrack by Philip Glass).<br />5) Drive (Simply amazing soundtrack - picture - like being inside an 80s video game - must experience on weed :P - kind of violent though so watch out in case you can&#039;t handle that)<br />4) Dark City (The storyline is for me the closer anyone has got to describing the &quot;reality&quot; of humanity today. Up to the detail about resetting time by the &quot;Watchers&quot; which you can trace down to Reptilians re-setting humanity through cycles designed to keep us in the illusion of time and matter - read David Icke and you&#039;ll see this movie is far from being fictional).<br />3) Lion King (Grandiose soundtrack by Elton John - Hans Zimmer and storyline is really talking about the human condition - cut off from who we really are and us &quot;remembering&quot;)<br />2) Matrix (Don&#039;t think I need to introduce this one :P)<br />1) TRON (This is from beginning to end one big showcase of the musical marvel that Daft Punk are for electronic music. In this case they combine their genius with classical soundtrack scores and the result is out of this world. Storyline appropriately trippy with characters entering a video game which is a fully fledged reality in itself - and the visuals I quarantee you will be hardly pressed to find better. Please find in HD and even better 3D and from the moment the disney logo - Title flashes you know you are in for the ride of your life).

				So I&#039;ve been watching a lot of movies while tripping and I&#039;ve got a decent list going so far. I&#039;ve only been doing this for about 6 months so I&#039;ve got a whole lot of movies left to try out. I seem to enjoy the HD animated movies a lot, they&#039;re usually a lot of fun. I&#039;ve tried a few of the mind fuck movies, but they can be hard to follow sometimes.<br /><br />In no particular order:<br /><br />What Dreams May Come<br />Avatar<br />Despicable Me<br />Family Guy: Blue Harvest &amp; Something Something Dark Side<br />How to Train Your Dragon<br />John Carter<br />Source Code<br />Tangled<br />Megamind<br />UP<br />Brave<br />Ted

				I watched The Fountain last week and it was pretty good, kind of hard to follow at times but worth a watch. I watched Fantasia as well, hadn&#039;t seen it in probably 20 years. I want to go see this Life of Pi movie, it looks awesome form the trailer. I tried watching Fear and Loathing, but it was a little intense for my taste. These animated movies can look amazing,&nbsp; I actually got a little giggly when Brave got released because it looked so good.

				Quite surprised to see some faves mentioned only once or not at all.<br /><br />The Fountain<br />Solaris (Soderbergh remake)<br />Paprika (anime - don&#039;t miss it)<br />Ghost in the Shell<br />Baraka<br /><br />I&#039;ve tried Akira but wasn&#039;t a good mix that particular night.

				One addition to my own mini-list of &quot;never watch while tripping&quot; and it&#039;s the granddaddy: Pontypool. <br /><br />I mean, see it, then reflect on what it would be like to watch while tripping, by all means, but do not do it. It&#039;s got a bit of the standard horror fare, but also a mind-fuck that you would not want to be trapped in thought loops with whatsoever. The combination makes me kind of sick to think about, tbh.

				&quot;Enter the Void&quot;<br /><br />I watched &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; sober and it was really thought-provoking,.

				I like watching movies when tripping but it needs to be an uncomplicated plot, ideally musical and not too dark. I watched easy rider recently and it kinda took a dark turn, not what I was expecting! I&#039;ve watched a few absolute classics though... <br />Fantasia, obviously, stunning music and nice visuals. <br />The Wizard of Oz &amp; Dark Side of the Moon synced up (sometimes called the dark side of oz) was what I watched the first time I did L, never laughed so hard in my life as when the midgets showed up.<br />Baraka has come up a couple of times, very good and there are a few similar titles too, Chronos, Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi/Naqoyqatsi, all superb. Chronos in particular, slow mo/time lapse, great fun.<br />Microcosmos I&#039;m amazed hasn&#039;t come up yet! Can&#039;t speak for everyone but I can understand what all the insects are thinking :)<br />Man with a Movie Camera - very old film set to a superb soundtrack by Cinematic Orchestra, perfect!<br />HOME by Yann Arthus-Bertrand was one I watched recently, very good except for the woman telling you how fucked you are the whole way through :p<br />Dead Leaves, A Town Called Panic, Life in a Day, Cannibal the Musical, all get a thumbs up

				A few nights ago I watched &quot;EL TOPO&quot; by Alejandro Jodorowsky after swallowing a 25 mg capsule of 2c-b. It was my first experience with each and it was absolutely amazing. I recommend this to anybody who can appreciate films while on psychedelics. It is a timeless masterpiece of visual art. Not only is it visually pleasing but the storyline and dialogue are wonderful. Now one of my favorite movies ever made. I&#039;m sure it will be great on LSD or psilocybin also. Much thanks to the person who recommended it in an earlier post. Jodorowsky also did several other films. I plan on watching &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; the next time I dose at home.

				Lot of great suggestions here. I love movies on psyches, it feels so much more real. Does anybody else end up completely inventing their own plot for portions of a movie when they&#039;re tripping?<br /><br />Some movies I&#039;ve enjoyed while tripping:<br />Circus (A documentary about circus people. More emotional than you would imagine. The tension might be too much for some people.)<br />The Prestige<br />The Ladykillers (Not my favorite movie sober, but it was a lot of fun on LSD)<br />The Big Lebowski <br />O Brother, Where Art Thou<br />Paprika (Watched on 2c-b after reading this thread. Really great movie, rekindled my interest in Anime)<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread. This really helps me out, as I&#039;ll be trying some 25i tomorrow and this gives me something to do with my wife, who will be sober. <br /><br />

				I CAN NOT BELIEVE NO ONE MENTIONED SPEED RACER.<br /><br />i think it was made for tripping! trippiest movie ever imo!!!! the movie actually mirrors the tripping experience and just has like a million and 5 psychadelic references that only experienced psychonauts will get, besides the fucking out of this world colors and visuals. If you havent watched it yet please do so!!<br /><br />fear and loathing is good too.<br /><br />I&nbsp; didnt like the newer alice n wonderland when i was tripping on shrooms...turned it off.<br /><br />but speed racer and mushrooms....omg...you have to just watch it to know what i mean. there are moments that snap you out of the trip, etc i could go on forever on how trippy that movie is

				This is just a short and strange music video, but this blew my mind while I was tripping acid and I watched this... it&#039;s pretty strange anyway.&nbsp; It&#039;s the music video for Another Night in Tunisia by Manhattan Transfers, it feels like the song and video were made to be watched while on LSD or a similar psychedelic:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zKJqx7LZ0g
