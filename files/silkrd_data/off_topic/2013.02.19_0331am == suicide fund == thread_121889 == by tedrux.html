				Hello, this is teddy<br />I want to die<br />I don&#039;t really have anything going for me.<br />I don&#039;t plan on getting into a huge sob story because they are all over.<br />I can if you like.<br />I wish to purchase cyanide from the SR.<br />It will cost about 5 BitCoins.<br />I am trying to raise funds for this venture as I do not have a source of income and am unsure how to come across the money.<br />If you are willing to help me please pm me so I can extend my wallet information and we can transfer the funds.<br />Thank you for your consideration<br />-teddy<br />Ps. Do not worry about social scorn or a guilty conscience . This is discreet and no one will ever know you helped. Even if you do give me the funds only I can be responsible for if I go through with it or not. You cannot be responsible for some one stabbing some one else just because you bought the knife. For most people life is the epitome of value so you must question why some one would be willing to forgo that and assume it is with good reason. Even if that person is totally insane that is probably a good enough reason in and of itself because they will never lead a full life. Haters gonna hate but I&#039;ve obviously already been down that road so you saying to me or any public contributors is just a redundancy of my reasons. If you absolutely feel you must scratch the itch to criticize when you personally are not required to do or sacrifice anything then by all means go right ahead. Expect to be disregarded though, just being real.

				If you wanted to die you&#039;d have done so by now having found another way to off yourself, and something that&#039;s not as painful either. <br /><br />For anyone else who chimes in with a &quot;that&#039;s heartless etc&quot; no fucks are given in my comment above - being alive is a privilege, not a right! If tedrux wants to off him/herself, then so be it - his choice. <br /><br />This planet is overpopulated as it is. One less person? Big deal in the overall picture of things, yes, but at the end of the day - one less zombie i&#039;ll have to kill when the apocalypse comes.<br /><br />xoxo

				This thread confuses me.&nbsp; I feel like it might be a ploy to get free coins by playing on people&#039;s sympathies.&nbsp; On the other hand, I could be wrong.

				Lol, if I was sure I aided the process of natural selection; I&#039;d send him the entire package myself. Actually, you know what? Message me your PGP encrypted address and I&#039;ll mail an order of cyanide to you, myself so you can stop begging
