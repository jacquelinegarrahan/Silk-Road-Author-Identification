Surely these must be things that the average person wonders...

				I am also interested in this. I know that in every state I am aware of you must live there. And in CA its crazy easy to get a card I have found corrupt doctors with google it&#039;s quite easy. But if your out of state I am not sure how that would work. I have heard of one place in CA that just says put your hotels address. They also stand on the board walk and openly avertise so I hear. Gotta love California.

In California I think it&#039;s 6 plants, Oregon it&#039;s 20 something and you can have more in your possession than in California. So a lot of coop growers try to sell their product to be sold in dispensaries, but if it&#039;s not up to their quality they won&#039;t buy it and the growers stuck with it unless they can sell it illegally.

Dispensaries are a business, they could be easily talked into giving you a very good price, considering they get it at even fucklower prices since they never buy less that a LB of a particular strain at a time. Or so I heard in various MMJ documentaries and interviews with dispensary owners. <br /><br />
