				I need to raise about $50,000 in the next few months. Is dealing the only way to make this sort of money quickly?<br /><br />Ordering large enough amounts to do some private dealing worries me. I could easily make DMT or grow mushrooms and sell them on the Road. Weed is little more time consuming and I am never in one location long enough to care for plants. But selling on the Road is is like any other business, it takes time to get the product selling and DMT suppliers have increased ten fold since I joined up.<br /><br />What are the options?<br /><br />

				Growing 50k worth of shrooms should be possible within a few months if you&#039;ve got the space for it. Getting rid of those amounts might prove somewhat more difficult. <br /><br />I&#039;m afraid the only option is to sell your body to old and wealthy grannies!

				Lets see... you could start a pyramid scheme, steal the money, forge the money, practice your poker and win big at the casino... Are you looking for &quot;legit&quot; options? You could buy a cheap house, renovate it, and flip it for a big profit. You&#039;ll have to pay taxes on the 50 grand if you go legit though.

If I can find people willing to insider trade, and place spread bets on the outcomes. Anyone want to PM me?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Was thinking about trading bitcoins as well. Buy low on an exchange and sell on local bitcoin. But do I need any legit things for that? Having random people deposit money into my account I am going to need an answer for that. But buying and selling BCs isn&#039;t illegal.<br /><br />I have a legal and verified Mt gox account that I have never used for Silk road. I have enough spare cash to start something. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
