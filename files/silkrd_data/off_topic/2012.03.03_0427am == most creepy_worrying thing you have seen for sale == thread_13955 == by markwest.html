				I don&#039;t agree with it, but don&#039;t think you should rip someone off just because that&#039;s what they&#039;re looking for.<br /><br />I&#039;m also speaking from the perspective of a U.S. resident.&nbsp; An automatic may be necessary for self-defense in a more unstable country, like Mexico or another South American country.&nbsp; &nbsp;Just to keep up with what other people have... Cartels, gangs, etc... I could be wrong, just my opinion.<br /><br />Edit:&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to bring a semi-auto to a fully-auto gun battle

				It&#039;s not for sale but all the child porn on Tor really bothers me. Don&#039;t like having those guys as neighbors.<br /><br />Also saw a website on Tor claiming they were doctors, nurses and interns who were kidnapping homeless&nbsp; people, preforming experiments on them and then disposing the bodies, including newborns, once they were done. Don&#039;t know if it was real but it left a horrible taste in my mouth.

				we let off the jap doctors on the provision that they dont destroy, then hand over all their similar research data. i mean they had been doing the same shit or worse as the most perverse creeps in the nazi camps, but they were only doing it to non whites, so it was fine.

				I agree with those of you talking about child porn and murder and torture, it makes me sick to think that these disgusting creatures(I don&#039;t even want to say &#039;people&#039;) are our neighbors. As far as that &quot;scientific&quot; website that is supposedly doing human experiments goes, I personally don&#039;t believe that it&#039;s real. The website itself looks like something they made with freewebs.com, and (though I have never clicked past the 1st page) I haven&#039;t seen any evidence of any real experiments going on. Putting bleach in a pregnant woman&#039;s womb? What the fuck will that prove or disprove? That a fetus can&#039;t live after it&#039;s been drowned in bleach? Lol no shit.

It&#039;s all in English. It&#039;s mostly about drug use in Russia. Not really disgusting or graphic, at least what I read,&nbsp; but pretty informative. Worth checking out. He&#039;s been banned however not that that matters.<br /><br />Searching for Krokodil however, will bring up some pretty disgusting thumbnails. Be forewarned.<br /><br />The Dnepropetrovsk maniacs video is the one I was thinking of when I was talking about the vile stuff on the Googlewebs but I didn&#039;t want to cite in fear that someone would search for it. I would never expose that to someone without them knowing what to expect and even then, reluctantly.<br /><br />I spend about 2 or 3 months last year surfing the web searching for stuff beyond the norm. I was even searching for places like SR but wasn&#039;t sure where to look. I only suspected that the deepweb existed. I saw some pretty terrible things even on Youtube but the Dnepropetrovsk video is probably the most horrific. It makes decapitation and suicide bomber videos seem like Disney films. The only video I couldn&#039;t stomach was the 2 girls,1 cup one but that&#039;s because it&#039;s so disgusting but the Dnepropetrovsk video was probably the all around worst thing I&#039;ve ever seen.<br /><br />But for fun and laughs, you should check out Mr. Hands.

Then they get sent to vending machines? Or are they extra economical and they just rub pussy juice and butt smell all over them one after the other?
