				Okay.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been watching this tonight here in the uk and i cannot believe anyone hasnt made a post about it before.<br />Even my brothers and my 64 year old mother love it.<br />You gotta admit, Chuck Lorre is a pure genius.

				It&#039;s pretty old in the states. like going on its fifth season. Chuck Lorre is okay if you like Two &amp; a Half Men. Louis C.K. is a real comedy genius in my opinion. You should watch an episode of Louie.

				i just recently got started on the big bang theory and love it too actually. a scientist by profession, it really speaks to a side of me most other shows cant<br /><br />i dont know if it will work in your neck of the electric woods but check out videobull.com and select &quot;the big bang theory&quot; on the list on the right.&nbsp; if youre careful not to just click on ads, of which for every video youll get like 5, you can actually watch all five seasons for free online. there may be a better place,&nbsp; but i prefer real woods and havent spent much time searching<br /><br />i was honestly hoping this was about the origins of the universe&nbsp; and not the tv show though<br /><br />recently heard about a cyclic theory for &quot;what happened before the big bang?&quot; that i found to be very interesting. like a ballon expanding and collapsing in on itself.&nbsp; not hawkings stupid there was no time before time so there was nothing... just makes no sense to me.&nbsp;

				Yeah it&#039;s so great cause he can really imitate how most people see everyday life. Which last nights episode explored that cause most guys have no problem reviving, but giving is a whole different story.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />On a side note, I too was hoping we&#039;d be talking about the universe and its beginnings.<br /><br />

				Eh as far as shows go, I feel like people enjoy watching it because it makes them feel &quot;smart&quot; . The jokes are predictable as hell, the character types have been beaten to death, it just seems like another UPN &quot;Friends apartment&quot; rehash. <br />Also one may draw comparison to the superior IT crowd british sitcom which is where I beleive the network ripped their idea. We Americans like taking quirky Brit comedy and sedating for American consumption. <br /><br />Sorry guys Im a crab I spose.<br />

				I really have trouble getting into the show, myself. I think the whole idea of the show is pretty okay, but what annoys me most about the entire thing is how they have an audience recorded laughing at the jokes. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s the only show that does that, but it really bothers me. If something is funny, I don&#039;t need other people laughing at it for me to figure it out. =P<br /><br />Besides that, sometimes the jokes are just a little too nerdy for my tastes. Hopefully somebody else can make an intellectually funny show that has less of an emphasis on the stereotypes regarding intellectual people being nerdy. Or, if there is one already, I would love to discover it.

				TBBT has never disappointed me. BTW did you know that the characters are based on Dexter (the cartoon)? Other than TBBT, I used to enjoy HIMYM, but it got monotonous and boring. But the new Futurama season started a week ago :D WOOHOO!

				Yeah i wasnt impressed by HIMYM either.&nbsp; Some american comedies i find are very &quot;samey&quot;, if that makes sense, no offense intended of course.&nbsp; You can get pretty shit brit comedies also.<br />Thats what makes TBBT so original.&nbsp; Chuck Lorre is a genius.&nbsp; And, quite frankly, Charlie Sheen can go and suck monkey balls.<br />Does anyone here watch british comedy or tv in general?
