				I&#039;ve personally HEARD that 25i is better and that 25i is more visual and 25c is more fun &quot;feelings wise&quot;.<br /><br />Personally I&#039;ve only taken 25i and based on the &quot;bestsellers&quot; sorting feature people care for 25i a lot more based solely on sales.<br /><br />Also I&#039;ve found that everyone has their &quot;sweet spot&quot; for 25i. Too much always leads to too much bodyload to enjoy myself and I just sit there in a rut of depression.<br /><br />1.5mg is my &quot;perfect dose&quot;.<br /><br />Some can trip balls with 1mg but that doesn&#039;t quite make me trip, more of an MDMA/Acid/Amphetamine mix.<br /><br />1.5mg has my laughing uncontrollably at the visuas and fractals appearing everywhere.<br /><br />Keep in mind people have taken 30mg without dying but I would not recommend it, the &quot;unknown research chemical&quot; aspect of it makes high doses undesirable.<br /><br />Personally I have stopped taking 25i because you are treating yourself like a guinea pig but it&#039;s your body.

				Neither is similar to lsd.its so much different I love both 25i and 25c but neither one is close to lsd. <br /><br />Take them to take 25i or take lsd to take lsd.They are all thier own molecule and have thier own feeling. If anything dob is probly the closest thing to lsd ive ever tried but only did it once.

				25i is probably more visual.&nbsp; And more dangerous than LSD.&nbsp; Both are inferior to LSD.&nbsp; I personally like the 2Cs but hate the NBOMEs.

				In short, I found 25i to be just a colorful rather light on the head trip with alright body load.<br />I preferred the 25c because of the type of visuals, I felt it was 1 step closer to LSD for me. There was a little more head fuck and the visuals had a less fake feeling.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think that 25c is more visual.. or at least more visually attractive. Anecdotal, but that&#039;s my experience.. 25i isn&#039;t really visual for me, even in high doses I didn&#039;t get closed eyes visuals, and open eyes just trails and some patterning. Mixed with 25c It was completely improved visually.&nbsp; ;D 25c alone would also make me get some good visuals.<br />&nbsp;<br />Not that I&#039;m taking nbomes (15~ times) anymore, even if I really like the series. I had to choose, and I&#039;m gonna stay with stimulants, only and only amphetamine sulphate. Not even alcohol. They&#039;re good to try, but I find that they make me feel sleepy and sloppy some days afterwards, and is a RC.. So I&#039;m done with them until there is more information about their effects.<br /><br />Bye.<br />

				Have been doing 25i most weekends and have to say don&#039;t get much in the way of visuals, maybe some trailing, slightly enhanced colours and distorted perspective, living room can seem extraordinarily large, but like the greater emotional/experiential intensity. Allows me to get totally into music, emotionally connect with it on a much stronger level, sad music can almost make me cry, funny things become hilarious. I usually drink alcohol with it so avoid the full-on body load but must say, if I don&#039;t eat, end up with a shocker of a headache next day, so I make a point of eating before going to bed. Makes for a fun night. Was a regular user of 2CI but as I never weighed out doses, could end up having a mild trip one night and being totally, totally fucked another. What I like about the 25i is that the dosage in generally consistent.

				2-cb is a better alternative than most RC&#039;s<br /><br />It has been around longer (1980&#039;s)&nbsp; and the side effects are preferable to the side effects of others in the 2c family.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I enjoyed 25i for the visuals. I have had 5 1mg hits at once... It was insane, and I do not recommend more than 2 for a first time, or three at the most!! Vasoconstriction can be pretty bad on the come down.
