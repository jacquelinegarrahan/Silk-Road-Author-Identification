				all hypothetical of course<br /><br />majority of internet dealers got there by being street dealers for a while first so my question is this <br />which do you prefer and find safer....i believe that the internet is both safer and will in time be the larger of the 2 and is the future<br />also do you think a worldwide internet drug cartel could be formed and successfully run<br />how would membership be made and verified ?<br />how many successful transactions would be needed to gain membership ?<br />obviously to tier positions would got to wholesale suppliers but how would the other ranks be formed and would it work ???<br />between sr worldwide&nbsp; there would have to be wholesalers from countries such as Germany, netherlands and mexico able to for fill all the major needs ???

				Dealing with small amounts on the street is a nightmare so I prefer the Internet for those. Larger orders I.e 1-2oz+ is easier on street as large amounts are more difficult to package, buyers are more likely to pull scam, and cashing btc that large is more difficult. On the street it&#039;s just cold hard cash which is nice.<br /><br />Dank

				The internet is better. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a violent nor am I a shady guy. Street dealing is really not my thing, even though I did deal ecstasy pills when I was 17. Hated that, moved away. <br /><br />Silk Road? Man you said it, it&#039;s the future! I can run my thing like a business, not like a shady street dealer who has no respect for his clients!

				I would not like to buy things from the street.&nbsp; I only use SR.&nbsp; Much safer and discreet.&nbsp; I would not like others to be mindful of my business.
