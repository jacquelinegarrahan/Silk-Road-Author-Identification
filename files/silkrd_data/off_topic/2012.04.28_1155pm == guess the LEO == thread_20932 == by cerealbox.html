				I honestly think the possibility that mike murphy got pinched and the LE used his account to have a bunch of people buy large quantities of acid that can be easily make a case for dealing or intent to is a possibility given that he was from TFM and supposed to be legit there. <br /><br />Just my random observations that made me think twice when I looked at the pieces, but other than sideline observation is is just a random theory of mine with no evidence or substantial proof to back my suspicion.

				I am willing to bet that LE is definitely buying on here. If you have read any of the 66 page indictment that covers the TFM bust, you will see the undercover what buying large amounts and dealing directly with the dealer.<br /><br />Same thing is going on here.&nbsp; Ironically enough, us small time buyers are probably not scrutinized much. Too many of us for them to go after. Big vendors would be my worry.&nbsp;

				Clearly the silk road is a brilliant scheme by the DEA to get as many people caught buying and selling drugs as possible for some ultimate drug bust some time in the future. They&#039;re recording your every purchase and your ISP and every post you make. After all, the Silk Road is just a frigging website! How the hell has the DEA not figured out how to shut it down yet?
