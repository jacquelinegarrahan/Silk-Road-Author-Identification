				Hey guys!<br /><br />I am planing on going to a rave very soon and my buddy and I are thinking about candyflipping. I&#039;ve done both LSD and MDMA separately but this will be the first time candyflipping. I bought 5 tabs of 300 ug of LSD on SR and my buddy and I were thinking about doing 2 1/2 tabs each plus around 250 MDMA with out doing any Reups. I am nervous about taking 750 ug of LSD and having the trip become too overwhelming to handle at a rave, especially when Erowid has posted on their website that over 400 ug of LSD is considered a &quot;heavy dose&quot;.<br /><br />Any thoughts on this? Any/all comments are appreciated!

				Few notes. Take in mind this is all personal recommendation. I&#039;d say do 150ug (half a tab) and 100 mg of mdma. That may sound light, but both of these drugs play off one another. One of the biggest issues people have with candyflipping is that the mdma overpowers the lsd. You obviously have enough acid where that wont be an issue. What&#039;s the highest dose of lsd you&#039;ve had and think about how you functioned on that. Then remember that the effects increase exponentially as you up the dose.<br /><br />tl;dr I wouldn&#039;t dose that high, but if you think you can handle it feel free. Should be fun no matter what.

				You&#039;re probably more experienced than me if you&#039;re even considering that but it sounds possibly a little too high to me. Plus, if you&#039;re on and everything is good, you could just do some more of whatever you want as opposed to wishing you had done less. I&#039;m not positive how well boosting LSD works but I&#039;m pretty sure its okay. Then, of course, MDMA boosting is great haha. <br />I&#039;m sure you will but I&#039;ll say it anyway...have fun

				I would not recommend 750 ug of acid with that much mdma lol unless you are very very experienced. But I am interested in how that night turns out if you do it tbh. Come back and tell us how it went!

				If those tabs really are 300ug (that seems very strong for a single tab to me), two and a half will give you an extremely intense experience, almost certainly involving ego death from what I&#039;ve heard about doses like that. I&#039;m planning on candyflipping for my first time tomorrow on a tab of ~120ug LSD and ~200mg MDMA plus a booster - I&#039;ll let you know how it goes :)

				Lower your dose unless you wish to be walking around a parking lot naked with a stolen mannequin which will appear to be your friend.

				if you actually do 700mics of real L ,with or without the mdma, and go in public, the results will NOT be good!! If you stay in private and eat 700mics of real LSD the results will not be good!! That is one of the problems of ass clowns advertising their L as these large amounts, then a customer gets L that is closer to actually being 50mics, people eat 2 or 3 to get where they want to be, SO, people get the misinformed notion they need to eat a 5 strip, or some other BS, if you have to eat more than 2 hits it is NOT 100mic hits of L, PERIOD. i personally do not like to candyflip at crowded events. Good Luck and if your friends are coming up with these dosage amount ideas, you might consider new friends or you call the shots in your group, cause those guys will get you hurt or in trouble, just sayin. Please take my advice, 300mics of L will have you going through thought processes that you can&#039;t even imagine right now, 700+ and you might be spun for a bit, seriously might take you a while to get your shit back together, as in weeks or months. Good Luck and Happy Trails!!!

				Thanks for the replies guys! I think I will probably only do 1 maybe 1.5 tabs with the MDMA. I was leaning towards the idea that 750 ug was way too much for a rave. I will gladly take more comments and suggestions.<br />I would also like to add the I bought the LSD tabs from juergen2001 so if anyone knows if his tabs are actually 300 ug or has any reviews on them, please share.&nbsp; :)
