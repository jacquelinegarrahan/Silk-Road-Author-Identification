				Tonight, in the interest of science channel 4 will be broadcasting some British celebrities high on MDMA, this important experiment has been filmed and will be shown tonight at 9 or 10 pm tonight, should be worth a look.&nbsp;

				Gotta tune in to this one, if purely just for my Professor Nutt fix.<br />&nbsp;The man just totally won my adoration with the fantastic and frankly brave publication of his scientific observations of the relative harm of legal/illegal drugs. (Which for those few that don&#039;t know, resulted in his being fired from his government advisory role).<br /><br />He also convincingly argues the farcical nature of our current drug regulation and the related laws (actually statutes, not real laws...) and all the while not being easily dismissed or detracted from because he is not actually &quot;pro drug&quot; and does not even promote the recreational use of drugs.<br /><br />A true scientist and an honest, open minded speaker.<br />&nbsp;The sort of individual who has the potential to make real change!<br /><br />Brilliant.<br />Hope the show doesn&#039;t get ruined by the celebs though.<br />&nbsp;TV has a track record of &quot;scare storying&quot; any supposed un-biased documentary shows with a drug theme.<br /><br />we&#039;ll see...<br /><br />:)

				sausage and mash you beat me to it, started up a thread on this but as soon as I found yours, I deleted it. I hate double threads on the same topic. I&#039;m really pleased channel 4 has decided to do this, rather then be in denial over a subject that is part of the tapestry of everyday life, and go with the times. It&#039;s also brilliant that they&#039;re portraying it not in a positive way or in a negative way, but in a very fair and just way, with scientific evidence. Hopefully, this will go on to be a ground breaker, and make the British public a little more accepting then what the majority currently is by misinformation. It&#039;s time for the British public to stop living in the darkness and start seeing the light, hopefully this will be a contributory factor, but maybe that&#039;s just me being optimistic, I hope not. :)

				Interesting watch!<br /><br />Not sure why the man who had been in the military said he was going in to the experiment with an open mind but then tried to fight the effects of it.. if he was to just go with the flow had the sounds of Mr SuicideSheep&#039;s youtube channel in the background then he would have found it more pleasurable :P

				There were two events in the second part of the drugs trial tonight that really made me happy. 1. Seeing EX-MP Lib Dem Dr Evan Harris being in complete denial and gurning like a cunt, he looked like he&#039;d been smacked in the face with a shovel, seeing him like that really made my night - He was in total denial to MDMAS effects, throughout the whole test trying to keep his composure, when he had clearly lost the plot. Complete denial, yup, just like every other politician then! He said at the end &#039;God I would be tedious in a nightclub&#039; moral of the his trial learnt, never take an MP with you to Ibiza! :D I found him highly amusing to say the least! 2. 94% (that&#039;s 16,920) of the 18,000 viewers who voted their big drugs survey agreed that the government policy on drugs isn&#039;t working, and needs a complete reform.<br /><br />The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) research for using MDMA as a psychotherapy treatment was a real eye opener. Wasn&#039;t happy to hear that Urquhart quoted a Home Office spokesman as saying &#039;televising the use of illegal drugs risks trivialising a serious issue&#039;. I actually found this very moronic, and would argue, most certainly, developing improved treatments for severe health problems is also a serious issue. I hope this research continues for as long as it needs to.<br /><br />It was shocking to see the variable purity of pills seized at Glastonbury (they tested all the pills seized at Glastonbury last year), they varied between 20 - 129mg MDMA, bulked out either flour or talc, even more scandalous 1/3 of the pills tested contained NO MDMA at all, which just shows how rubbish E&#039;s in the UK generally are. Sad but true, the scientists have spoken :(

				Was very nice indeed!

Scientist (well, fake ones..) who deny scientific facts just because political pressions or fake ideology, i hate them... &gt;:(you cannot deny science you cannot bend it for your interest, and it&#039;s what they do, fortunatly they had a very little side role, any critical eye could read the lie on their face as they were blatering &quot;it&#039;s bad it&#039;s bad, it has no therapeutic value, there are better legal drugs&nbsp; etc etc..&quot;. ::)<br />+1 karma to channel 4! ;)<br />PPfld
