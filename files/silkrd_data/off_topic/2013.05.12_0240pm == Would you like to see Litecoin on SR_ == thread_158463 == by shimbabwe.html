				Pretty simple question, just curious where the community stands on it.<br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to suggest it would be an easy thing to implement as I know nothing about coding.

				it wouldn&#039;t replace bitcoins it would just be an alternate option. Nobody is saying vendors would HAVE to accept it, it would be solely at their discretion whether they would or would not.<br /><br />You guys seem to think it is too late to get on the Litecoin train, when it&#039;s really still sitting at the station waiting for a conductor to arrive. Whether DPR wants to be that conductor is up to him/her/it, but I think diversity is never a bad thing<br /><br />Bitcoins used to be worth 3 dollars too until SR blew up in popularity<br /><br />SR accepts litecoins ---&gt; litecoins blow up in value<br /><br />it&#039;s not like I&#039;m preaching for PPC coins to be on SR like let&#039;s be reasonable here

				Diversity can only be a good thing.&nbsp; If SR supported numerous cryptcurrencies we&#039;d be less vulnerable to fluctuations etc wouldn&#039;t we?<br /><br />Atlantis support litecoins too, so I&#039;d imagine it&#039;s good for SR to keep up with competitors.
