				Ketamine has taught me so many things about myself and my surroundings. Some trips I get nothing from, but some trips have changed my life entirely. I highly recommend it to anyone searching for a drug that can give you spiritual or though-provoking trips.

				I find it can give you a spiritual experience without k holing. I think a lot of it depends on your state of mind. I mentioned in the &quot;what do you watch while you trip&quot; thread that I like to read sci fi or fantasy books while I use dissociatives. I find that familiar books can take you out of the world entirely and let you live in the book&#039;s world for a while. Depending on the book and author, this can have profound effects. Try the short story &quot;Call Me Joe&quot;, read it once sober, then reread it as you&#039;re using Ketamine.<br /><br />Provided you enjoy reading, this can be a very rewarding experience.

				I bought a small amount of K to experiment with recently and I really don&#039;t know what to make of it. Low doses seem pointless to me, it&#039;s like being sober except you can&#039;t move without feeling nauseous. I just did a large amount last night and listened to some music, I spent about an hour having vivid recollections of events in my life that I totally forgot about. It was really interesting.<br /><br />But a few weeks ago, the first time I took a stab at a large dose, during a shroom comedown. That was the most what-the-fuck hour of my life.<br /><br />I split it into two big lines, railed the first one and waited a while. Once I started to feel it for some reason I started thinking about vampires. I started wondering if vampires exist, and eventually convinced myself that they do, and the government is covering it up. Then I did the second line, and in the most intense moment of clarity I have ever felt in my existence, I realized that I AM A VAMPIRE. <br /><br />I spent the next hour twitching around in my bed saying &quot;Vampire... I am a vampire&quot;, whilst drawing and retracted my fangs that I totally believed I had, and I was completely oblivious to the fact that I was under the influence of a drug. Tasting immortality felt damn good, and made for a hilarious story when it was over.

				my responsible and moderate, yet consistent work with ketamine has expanded my imagination in general and greatly enhanced my ability to lucid dream.&nbsp; and IMO, controlling your dreams is a path to godhood.<br /><br />so yes, my ketamine experiences have been very spiritual.

				i think of ketamine as something of a training ground for your astral mind/body.&nbsp; its like the &quot;danger room&quot; from the x-men comic book series, if you&#039;re familiar with that.&nbsp; plant psychedelics are where the real action takes place, but its helpful to do some exercises in the danger room before heading out into battle
