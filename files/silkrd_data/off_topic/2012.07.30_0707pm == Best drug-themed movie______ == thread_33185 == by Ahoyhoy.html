				I can&#039;t recommend the best drug themed movie, as we all have our favourite vices, and like different things! <br /><br />I for one, have many of them, so can&#039;t just choose one!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />But I&#039;d like to recommend...<br /><br />1. Trainspotting - For H, obvious and amazing! Although I don&#039;t do H, I was mindblown by this epic film! :)<br />2. Blow - For Coke, the obvious again and amazing - If you haven&#039;t seen it yet, where have you been? ;)<br />3. Requiem for a Dream - Four individuals, all fucked up on heroin, cocaine, and speed, and the problems that come with it, brilliant script, beautifully acted, simply superb! :D<br /><br />Have any of you heard/watched a film called Dead Babies? <br /><br />It&#039;s based on Martin Amis second novel, and is about a clash of British and American youth cultures, it&#039;s very engaging! <br />&nbsp;<br />It has a mean streak and a devilishly dark side, if you like your dark humour you&#039;ll thoroughly enjoy it, and is refreshingly original! <br /><br />One to watch!&nbsp; :)

				Human traffic, Danny dyer being a cockney geeza is his best performance, thinking about it that&#039;s all he ever plays...good film though.<br />Bill hicks - Revelations, not strictly a drug movie/documentary but its a fairly strong theme in his show.

Like the bit where raoul&#039;s at the petrol station asking where to find the American dream and it&#039;s a place where all the junkies and lowlife&#039;s hangout. That bit really sticks in my mind.<br />Although not a drug film/book the rum diary was good too.. Unfortunately they didn&#039;t follow the book quite as closely for that one.

				Fear and Loathing is a great watch. Something about seeing two guys push their boundaries while having a wild crazy time doing it is just so fun to watch.<br /><br />Also, Blow. Any movie that can make you want cocaine that bad after watching is good in my books.<br /><br />edit: Can&#039;t believe I forgot about the Dude. Big Lebowski is awesome. Also Dazed and Confused is a pretty good chill movie.

				Most of the best drug movies have been mentioned (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Withnail and I, etc.), so here are some others I think were missed:<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/<br />Alex and his droogs drink milk laced with synthemesc, vellocet, or drencrom before committing their crimes in this classic Kubrick satire. &quot;Synthemesc&quot; is synthetic mescaline; &quot;vellocet&quot; is methedrine/speed, and &quot;drencrom&quot; is adrenochrome. A classic.<br /><br />Rules of Attraction<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292644/<br />Bret Easton Ellis, author of American Psycho, Less Than Zero, and The Informers among others, has called this one of the best movies based on one of his books.<br /><br />The Big Lebowski<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/<br />The Coen brothers&#039; offbeat comedy classic is hilarious with a joint, white russian, or nothing at all.<br /><br />Weeds<br />http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439100/<br />This one doesn&#039;t fit since it&#039;s a tv show, but season 1-3 feature some of the funniest pot-related moments around as well as light drama. Along these lines, I&#039;d also recommend the American version of the British show Shameless (the British version is probably as good or better, but I have never watched it).<br />

				I watched Trainspotting again last night and love it every time I watch it, I decided to total up what everyone has said as a gauge of which is the most popular (ignoring the ones which were mentioned only once/twice), not particular scientific but will help me pick out some new films:<br /><br />Fear and Loathing - 13<br />Trainspotting - 11<br />Blow - 8<br />Requiem for a Dream - 8<br />Human Traffic - 7<br />Drugstore Cowboy - 5<br />Cocaine Cowboys - 4<br />Withnail and I - 4<br />Enter the Void - 3<br />King of New York - 3<br />The Big Lebowski - 3<br />Pulp Fiction - 3<br />A Scanner Darkly – 3<br /><br />I’m surprised Scarface didn’t get mentioned more, but apart from that the top 5 match what I would of said and its time for me to go looking around Newzbin and TPB&nbsp; ;D

				There&#039;s a pretty good DMT documentary called The Spirit Molecule which is definitely worth a watch and&#039;ll likely put get you scouring the SR DMT vendors.&nbsp; Focuses on both freebasing DMT and ayahuasca - good thing about the people interviewed is they&#039;re all pretty respected academics and all of them are extremely positive about their experiences, acquired knowledge and peace of mind they have achieved since.

Not necessarily for realism, but for the story and the characters. Sara Goldfarb, believe it or not, is my favorite character in the movie. The actress playing Sara did such an amazing job of portraying her downfall. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the other characters&#039; stories were equally depressing, but the performance and delivery that she gave as Sara was absolutely stunning.
