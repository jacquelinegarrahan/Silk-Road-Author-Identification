				Can someone comment on teh fact that these new &quot;socialists&quot; like the Spanish prime minister, and the new president of France belong to supposedly socialist parties, yet they behave like any other run of the mill capitalist liberal or conservative? They ally themsleves with the banksters and oligarchs instead of with the people and workers.<br />

				Living in a country that contributes majorly to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), I&#039;d like to know why Mr Mariano Rajoy, Spains Prime Minister has used some of the â‚¬100 billion bail out to go visit Poland and watch football? I&#039;m sure this trip with all his entourage and friends must have cost in the tens of thousands?<br /><br />Surely the money could be put to better use employing even 1 or 2 of the 50% unemployed youth that Spain has?<br /><br />Oh I do love socialists&nbsp; ::)

				I see all that, but I still don&#039;t believe it. I think the only true socialist out there is Hugo Chavez; at least he has reduced poverty, illiteracy and bettered the health care system a great deal in Venezuela.
