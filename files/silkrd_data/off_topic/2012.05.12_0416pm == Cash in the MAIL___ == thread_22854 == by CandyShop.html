				It&#039;s unwise.&nbsp; A postal worker could steal the money, or the recipient could claim he never got the money.<br /><br />If you are trying to buy bitcoins, with bitinstant you can make a cash deposit to any Chase or Bank of America branch and get credited within an hour.<br /><br />And if you really need to send money in the mail, a money order is much more secure.

				The thing is I need to get cash anonymous from point A to B.... <br />Without involving a bank... getting large amounts deposited in a bank....will raise suspicion<br /><br />And by the way im in the EU..<br /><br />

				If you can&#039;t send a money order, be smart about sending the cash.<br /><br />Put in inside an envelope with some business-looking documents and the cash discretely tucked in the fold.<br /><br />Write a return address on the back of the envelope where it is sealed, and put Scotch tape over the address/seal - it will be obvious if it&#039;s been tampered with.<br /><br />And remember - there&#039;s no guarantees of any kind when sending cash in the mail! Do so at your own risk!

				i do it all the time, but only ever notes and never big amounts.<br />With coins they can easily tell that there&#039;s money in there, making them likely to just take it. I would get a bit of paper either side so you cant see through the envelope. But yeah it should be fine its its small amounts, but for big bucks send a cheque.

				When I was in high school I sent cash in the mail to order budmail twice and it worked both times. I used expresspost envelopes which are more secure than regular mail and i think I concealed it in a cigarette pack.<br /><br />btw it was a domestic parcel in canada, by expresspost I refer to the canada post product.

				Just ship it flat as possible and with some sort of tracking so the receiver can&#039;t claim they didn&#039;t get it. It&#039;s really easy, have moved a bit amount of money around this way.

				1. send as few bills as possible ( largest bills to make up the total )<br />2. send it wrapped in carbon paper<br />3. send using a traceable method to ensure honesty about receipt<br /><br />using overnight fedex or ups is best, especially when sending outside your own country.<br />
