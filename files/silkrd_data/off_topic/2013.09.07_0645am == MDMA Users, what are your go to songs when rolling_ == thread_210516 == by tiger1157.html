				I love finding new music, and literally enjoy it all: fast paced, slow paced, pop, EDM, you name it I&#039;ll fucking bounce to it.&nbsp; So throw it on me.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for songs that you&#039;ve listened to a thousand times, but could never get sick of them.&nbsp; Or songs that enhanced or amplified a roll for you.&nbsp; Let&#039;s get this rolling!!<br /><br />Here are a few of mine:<br /><br />Deadmau5 - Strobe<br />Hardwell - Apollo<br />atb - ecstasy<br />Tiesto - Feel It In My Bones<br />Adrian Lux - Teenage Crime (Axwell Remix)<br />Imogen Heap - Hide and Seek (Afrojack Remix)<br />Guru Josh Project - Infinity 2008<br />Pendulum - The Island (Steve Angello, AN21 &amp; Max Vangelli Remix)<br />St Lucia - All Eyes on You<br />Armin Van Buuren - Never Say Never<br /><br />These are just some of the ones that will never get old to me.&nbsp; Let&#039;s hear &#039;em people!<br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;m of the belief that if a song is good, it can be appreciated whether sober or intoxicated. A pet peeve of mine is when people talk about music only being good while one is intoxicated. I understand where they&#039;re coming from but I guess it&#039;s how they say it... I think you know what I mean. Keep in mind that little rant wasn&#039;t directed at you or anything cuz I know that&#039;s not what you&#039;re saying. <br /><br />Anyway, here&#039;s some songs from a playlist I wrote down a while back and never made. I use Pandora for all my music and love it. Some people don&#039;t like it but I believe it&#039;s because they aren&#039;t using it properly or have a bias. You may want to look into it, especially because you said you love finding new music. All these songs are related to drugs as far as I know and am sure I&#039;d love them when I&#039;m rolling (I know that&#039;s kind of a low standard haha)<br /><br />•I Don&#039;t Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me) (Live)- Marilyn Manson<br />•Drugs are Good- NOFX<br />•Ecstasy- Darude<br />•Feel Good Hits of the Summer- Queens of the Stone Age<br />•I Want to be a Hippy- Technohead<br />•Prescription- Mindless Self Indulgence<br />•Who Has the Marijuana?- Alien Project OR Skunk- Alien Project OR One Good (Remix)-Alien Project<br />•Psycho- System of a Down<br />•Tomorrow Never Knows- The Beatles<br />•Choke Me- The Used<br />•Maxwell Murder- Rancid<br />•Ganja Dub- Sukh Knight<br />•Let&#039;s Go Smoke Some Pot- Reel Big Fish<br />•The 12 Drugs of Christmas- Tenacious D<br />•Yoda Smokes Weed- Weird Al<br />•Time to Burn- Storm<br />•Trippy Green Skull- Dan Deacon<br />•Overdose- GMS<br />•Outback [philantropic Mix]- Aqualite

				You can&#039;t roll without listening to this fucking classic, add a bit of NOS and ketamine and you&#039;ll have the time of your life..<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjXsc0UjdQ<br /><br />also these are some of my favorites for when we stay in and listen to music...<br />liquid DNB - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekF7y4Am4U<br />House - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZSO6qQqpqc<br />House - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-5hlhetEFM<br />I could send a million links over but I shall stop :P<br /><br />Basically anything you love when your sober and has a happy beat, you&#039;ll love a million times more rolling.

				Strobe is a fucking killer tune when rolling, I saw DeadMau5 live while on MDA and he played it as his final song. Absolutely incredible...<br /><br />If you&#039;re into EDM I could recommend a few that I love when rolling:<br /><br />Madeon - Icarus<br />Madeon - Finale<br />Feed Me - Death By Robots<br />Dada Life - Happy Violence<br />DeadMau5 - Some chords<br />DeadMau5 - Ghosts N stuff Hard Intro Mix<br />Daft Punk - Da Funk<br /><br /><br />

				For an intimate roll with a significant other, there&#039;s nothing that beats Lazy Sunday Selecta by Breakbot. It&#039;s 38 minutes of love. Put it on and you never have to separate from each other while you peak!

				When rolling face, here are a coupla my top favorites. Raindrops, feat Stunt. Heavy Delta&#039;s cover of Nero&#039;s must be the feeling, found on Soundcloud. Then Damaged by Plummet the extended club mix, and give me last, but not least, Dark Globe.
