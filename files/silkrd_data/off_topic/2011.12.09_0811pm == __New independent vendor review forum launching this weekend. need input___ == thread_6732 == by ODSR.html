				We are launching a new independent vendor review forum this weekend called Onion Drug Source Review. We hope to keep an organized forum where reviews can be easily made and read. The current rumor mill section here is what prompted us to take this on. We are putting things together today, and hope to have it launched on Saturday.<br /><br />We are looking for some input on organization. So far there are categories for the main public sites (SR, OVDB, TFM), and in that category, there are forums for general site discussion, and vendor reviews. The question is, would you like to have sub-forums by product, with threads about vendors in those sub-forums, or would you like sub-forums with star ratings, and all 4 star dealers be listed regardless of the products they offer. This is something that can always be changed after the launch, but We would like to know what you guys think during the build stage.<br /><br />VENDORS: there will also be additional threads available only to you should you choose to use them, but they will only be available to vendors who have a predetermined rating based on your history on your respective store.<br /><br />post your ideas and requests here, and we look forward to seeing you guys on ODSR

Creating threads per product will probably get messy.

				Right now, it is set up with a category for multi-vendor sites, then two forums (one for general SR reviews and one for Vendors), and I will be making sub-forums that will contain threads about individual vendors. the sub forums could either be based on product e.g coke sellers listed HERE or by ratings e.g Vendor A would be in the 4 star category while vendor B could be in the 2 star. I personally believe that they should be sub-categories by product, but wanted a bit of feedback before making it that way.
