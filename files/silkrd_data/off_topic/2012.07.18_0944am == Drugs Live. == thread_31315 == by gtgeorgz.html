				Oh wow, i didn&#039;t even read that. So basically they are admitting that they&#039;d rather their kids be brainwashed with bullshit, rather than be told the truth? Great parents, it seems. Not that they&#039;d ever encourage their kids to drink a beer or a glass of wine with them someday because &#039;oh, drugs are so bad&#039;. All a bit hypercritical, ignorant and naive really.

				I suspect that it will be unbalanced, with just enough thought put into it to fool the majority into thinking it was objective and unbiased. You know, kinda like how BBC journalism does things, where the perception that you are giving a fair view is way more important than actually doing it.<br /><br />(Note: I&#039;m not saying any mainstream news outlet is not doing this, but they seem to have it down to an art over there.)<br /><br />I hope the show is awesome. Hoping beyond hope. <br /><br />Check out the Discovery channel version they did, hosted by Robin Williams: &quot;Your Body On Drugs&quot;<br /><br />You can guarantee they will use that template and tweak it.<br /><br />

				Should be an interesting documentary, I&#039;m just wondering how balanced it will be. Most documentaries I&#039;ve watched tend to lean toward the negative aspects of drug use, they often go into the social problems they say are caused by drugs when in actual fact those problems are mainly caused by prohibition. You never hear about Johnny McBusiness who has a great career and drops some MDMA a few times a year. I&#039;m gonna a watch it with my girlfriend anyway, shes been brought up with a very strong &#039;drugs are bad&#039; outlook. I&#039;m trying to educate her on the ups and downs of drugs and I&#039;m making ground but its difficult to peel back the layers of conditioning.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31315.msg353467#msg353467">Quote from: gtgeorgz on July 18, 2012, 10:32 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">True say, probably avid Daily Mail readers too. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Its amazing the amount of people I hear who buy into the absolute bullshit that paper prints. When I see people reading it in public I feel like stealing their paper and making a run for it. :P<br />I follow a lot of science news from reputable websites, occasionally you will see one of these stories make it to the Daily Fail and the whole thing is ridiculously inaccurate, sensationalised, even fabricated in parts. <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31315.msg353452#msg353452">Quote from: sselevol on July 18, 2012, 10:23 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=31315.msg353427#msg353427">Quote from: gtgeorgz on July 18, 2012, 10:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Oh wow, i didn&#039;t even read that.

Shame its the only place in the UK I can buy root beer&nbsp; :P
