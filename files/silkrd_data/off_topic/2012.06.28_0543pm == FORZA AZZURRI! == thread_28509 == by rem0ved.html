				I just hope Germany scores early, God forbid the Italians come out in front and then the remaining time spent rolling on the ground trying to remember which ankle Lahm brushed against.

I was hoping Spain would slip up since I put money on Germany to win it. I gotta stop looking in this thread though since I recorded the game to watch tonight.

Wouldn&#039;t have minded if it was Pirlo but to have Balotelli score 2 is just heart breaking, hate that sob and to have him believe HE guided Man City to the title and HE guided Italy to the Euro Finals is just too much to take, and believe me that arrogant piece of shit believes both of them fully. I hope Ramos gives him a nice elbow to the face in the final.

				As much as I hate the greasy Italian cunt bags and their corrupt as fuck society, compared to Germany, they are my heroes. <br /><br />So congrats Italy. I just hope Balotelli gets an own goal in the final. That way, the huge amount of racists in your country will still have something to justify their beliefs. If balotelli got the winner, they&#039;d have to change their tune! And who the fuck would want that?<br /><br />It wouldn&#039;t be Italy without the scores of stubble laden wannabe lotharios making racial slurs and gesticulating with absurd body language.. <br /><br />(I&#039;m just kidding, I&#039;m Italian myself, I can say that)<br /><br />
