				A while back i read an article about how some hackers raged a war on Los Zetas or some other organization. I can&#039;t find the URL anymore but does anybody know about this and why? i remember hearing that two hackers were killed in some sort of retaliation.

				A call (and some vids) was made but it didn&#039;t really become an op, not enough interest.&nbsp; Even most, if any, moral fags weren&#039;t into it.&nbsp; I think the point was mostly to d0x pols and pigs in bed with the cartels but it&#039;s not that big of a secret that most pols and pigs are in bed with &#039;em, hell Wachovia got busted for laundering their funds and yet only had to pay a few hundred large in fines.&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides, what the hell do you expect to happen by throwing a LOIC or SQL injection at the Zeta&#039;s?&nbsp; <br /><br />Now hacking the GPS of Homeland securities drone fleet and sending that into Nuevo Laredo or Sinaloa, well that would be a lulzy op.

				Yeah I was thinking that what ever attacks they used most likely led back to them. But I agree that would be some awesome shit. <br />Anyway found an article but no the one i read.<br />http://www.mobiledia.com/news/114707.html<br />
