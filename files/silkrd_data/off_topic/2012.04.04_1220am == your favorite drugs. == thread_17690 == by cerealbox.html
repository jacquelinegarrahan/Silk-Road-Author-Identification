				Marijuana (daily use) and cocaine (infrequent use) are definitely my favorites. <br />Tried acid once and flipped the fuck out, so that&#039;s not on the list. <br />Took some E but it was cheap shit and only made me feel like I was really high, not ecstatic or happy, so I don&#039;t know if that counts.<br />Adderall was tons of fun. <br />Tried mushrooms once, chickened out and didn&#039;t take a full dose, but it was still cool.

				MDMA - Just fucking incredible for socialising/anything<br /><br />Alcohol - Always a reliable drug. You know where you stand with booze. Good times to be had all round<br /><br />2C-B - Pretty nice buzz and SICK visuals if you take a decent dose. Very very good combined with a couple beers/shots<br /><br />Opium/H no.3 - Womb like pleasure, so warm.. Just.. UGH. So amazingly pleasurable<br /><br />Weed - Great for just chilling at home or when you&#039;ve done a load of work and are looking to wind down<br /><br />Hash - The absolute fucking SHIT if you want a smoke before you go to bed. So many times I&#039;ve been sprawled out on the sofa with a slow burning joint of charis<br /><br />Mushrooms - Incredibly profound but not something I would do all the time. Takes a while to assimilate what I&#039;ve learnt into my everyday life<br /><br />LSD - On a sunny day outdoors, so beautiful<br /><br />

				Judged from a combination of effects and (lack of) negative side effects: 2CB<br />In terms of pure euphoria, nothing can beat MDMA.

I was literally staring at the grass for hours the last time I took it. Morphing, flowing rivers of light and fractal images combined with an MDMA style buzz and empathy.. Although I did have bad stomach cramps for a bit after and some terrible shits.

				Everyday choices...<br /><br />Hash<br />Bud<br /><br />Once a week or fortnight...<br /><br />Beer<br />Wine<br />Cannabis oil or ice water hash.<br /><br />Drugs I might use a few times per year (5 or less)<br /><br />MDMA<br /><br />Other drugs I might go for rarely...<br /><br />Amphetamine (takes too much out of me to be justified)<br />LSD (when the time is right its right!)<br />Mushrooms (as above)<br /><br />I&#039;m thinking about mescaline also. Not sure if the pure stuff is similar to the real thing.<br /><br />Ketamine - could be good as I hear good things about it as a kind of stay in and chill drug not a social lubricant.<br /><br />Drugs I never plan to use....<br /><br />Heroin<br />Meth<br />Viagra&nbsp; ;)
