				Hello.<br /><br />I like to draw. <br /><br />I will be doing drawings/paintings/scribbles to people that request one - you may donate bitcoins to me if you like, or you may just take the drawing and run. <br />I will send out the original drawings to the people that request so (pm me with&nbsp; address - see PGP code below if you wish to encrypt) I would appreciate btc for postage costs, but I won&#039;t demand it - I will upload photos for everyone to see anyway,<br />I will only physically send out drawings to people with over 40 posts- or with tits and timestamp - as I would prefer active members to benefit from this (or tits).<br /><br />First 3 drawings/paintings will be done digitally - these can not be posted for obvious reasons... I will show the process so that you know it is me doing them. I will wait a couple days for requests, otherwise I will just share drawings until you people join in.<br /><br />You may request a subject / share a photo for me to draw / ask for a random drawing.<br /><br />Reasons - I want to spend more time improving and maybe gain some btc in the process. <br />Hopefully this is the correct subforum.<br /><br />Yours faithfully,<br />Drawer<br /><br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----<br />Version: GnuPG v2.0.17 (MingW32)<br /><br />mQGNBE9efucBDACs58C/WZIkiPP8nbkkz7sDnw43Q2oDnEVLyKJ+QQ7nJs7amRLQ<br />OgPPPMG2C3eicvSrQsACdVL2DuKY54XKfr7Z2WgvMKNZ3wYFyKodRvkRiIGNIRIh<br />TiCWU/Qz0CqJAn7CwIhBi58JyP7Ue3DXBsfKPy/r9QMe6VA9E9XPyaMIoi9ZM8iP<br />ZfFld4TDOqzuybhH5n/UdiedJku+/bxlt32L3sIs/UVgJ4aV9nN9JxehPiOQxReB<br />N6yqpO6JEZVTKt+hZoTz3IXCGBPd4QiXfNdISLQNyv4moTdf3RIOZVIGlfpeHpcK<br />YwsG34Nwm49feDxlT03nM15ysB9bHlqMO7ihIldjg+698w8N6b219r4CcGBRZcYz<br />hr12u0L0W8yEz6KU2vtJL9QwKD5VoIX7chzDgEXc5UYRl9hlFPDfKSl70EacSXfS<br />D2NV0eXW71aNUGR3WHU7OgMX6WAinAYeDv/fvsFWWGc6qNEGniWE+J8SFZfatPfY<br />LWrQOZ3i2zU9LbsAEQEAAbRJRHJhd2VyIChSZXF1ZXN0IGEgZHJhd2luZyBzbWls<br />ZXkgZmFjZSkgPGRyYXdlckBhcnRhcnRhcnRhcnRhcnRhcnRhcnQuY29tPokBuAQT<br />AQIAIgUCT15+5wIbDwYLCQgHAwIGFQgCCQoLBBYCAwECHgECF4AACgkQ/2XRC4Ts<br />kcXgvwwAplvasIlq0t1mHwHxoHSISkSJknc9BeA13Df3guID5Wr2qJNI4lChVf6T<br />kDIw6h52toX52jhZ/R1pDQY8HSDCSPmifXqaVl0v71JEX892ZXhypoeW4MIrxVGC<br />gvGkiCSSMczk6P4CMX6kOsVN6ZXQF+tpF6SiCo7gK352G8rlnc3wdsuaRVLQ2VVu<br />s6LjcHUN1zhEhPnaKiFe72F5pzBMAM28ByNMZ+Q6hcorZKF/1u/R9A4hHMBX3cxx<br />QrsTgFN5LZ7gT9UnRdUzpmLyUFSkqGHclpv8Xa2hzlOx+y+ObcLFq19J/6YoFZBB<br />qf5BNKVREioqS4IesKCr9yoclpMqjLA33wN0NArH4DT5jEH9z1wNbWnYkFFWGx2J<br />1swee8qYAl3zp/H0mORQwmSpn9QYXsdGhV5J8lSrFjEuYvsc+6YzR5OkKiQsSBVn<br />sHcev2OWdK38QJ5rwcuLDQDEJGUUv51phrGqwOlw9PkUv0lj5pgyCIPkRUqR2jeB<br />YmOVWjz8<br />=vVR4<br />-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

				Hate to be a &quot;Debbie Downer&quot;, but how do we know you aren&#039;t just planning to draw up some search warrants, instead of art, by getting our addresses? Or draw us behind some bars?<br /><br />smells fishy, just saying....<br /><br />&quot;Just cause you&#039;re paranoid, doesn&#039;t mean they are not after you&quot;.<br /><br />

				I understand where you&#039;re coming from. But...<br />Why would LE spend hours of time drawing instead of paying LE funded money to become a vendor and send you my handcuffs?<br />You don&#039;t have to get anything sent to an address. If you are paranoid having your address linked to your buying account - you could make up a new account, send me some bitcoins and I would have anything sent out quicker than you can say quick.<br />I would just like requests so that I can improve. Every time I draw, I draw what Im comfortable with (excluding above) This means I&#039;m not versatile. :(<br />This is a totally legal service I am offering. However I do understand your concerns.

				Well, Drawer, the LE do employ sketch artists for face composites of suspects from witnesses right? lol. <br /><br />Hmm, actually they probably use like graphic computer programs to put a composite sketch together nowadays. Hey, If you aren&#039;t truly Narco or 21 jump streeting, then I apologize. We criminals of the illegal drug world gots to be careful . <br /><br />I can almost hear the theme of the classic reality TV show COPS in the background... &quot;Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do, when they come for you!&quot;

				I&#039;d like to request a painting of the album artwork of Exoplanet by The Contortionist.<br /><br />Google images of the artwork has a nice 1496x1498 for you to reference. I&#039;d love to see put in the same amount of detail.<br /><br />Just make me a quick sketch first. The bigger the better for the final product, I&#039;d be glad to leave you a generous tip if you were to do a good job. =)

				Well if nobody else is going to be too keen to jump in, I&#039;d love to request something!<br /><br />A person (male) playing a well-worn acoustic guitar. On his picking hand, his ring and pinky fingers are both half missing. His hair is long; partially dreaded, and very messy. His face is blacked out. He is sitting in a broken down city.<br /><br />I&#039;d love it if you could be as abstract as possible with the painting. It seems you like to draw that way anyway!<br /><br />As for posting it, I&#039;ll come back to you when I have 40 posts ;)<br /><br />(and for anyone concerned, this isn&#039;t a description of myself. Just trying to paint a picture.)
