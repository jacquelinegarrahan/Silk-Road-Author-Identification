				I was thinking about this for a bit last night. To qualify, obviously I hate the idea of police and their enforcement and shitty ways and I certainly do believe they fuck people over day in and day out. That being said, I wanted to share my personal experiences with them. <br /><br />At this point in my life, I have never had an experience with a cop that has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Every single cop I have ever unfortunately had the pleasure of dealing with has been a standup guy. From border patrol to my University Police. Every single one seemed to be doing their job which was worrying about real crime instead of my petty drug related acts against society. <br /><br />I can hear people screaming well youv&#039;e never done anything besides get a UPM or watevs. Nope, I&#039;ve been in some REALLY fucking sticky shit with the po pos. <br /><br />What are you experiences with the cops? Anyone else when being forced to deal with them left with not so terrible impressions or are you such biased fucklets that you&#039;ll never profess such a thing??

				I&#039;ve had dealings with respectful cops and some who were completely out of line.<br /><br />You can&#039;t paint an entire profession with a broad brush.<br /><br />That being said, I do everything in my power to avoid every single one of them!!

				The thing with cops is that part of them just want to do their job and earn a living, they&#039;re the respectable ones.<br />The other part are corrupt people that are only cops to rake in the perks and have power over the weak.<br />Most cops are just doing their job but there are some specific cities that are known for corrupt cops...<br />That&#039;s why there are so many different opinions of them.

				I&#039;ve seen some professional behavior from police officers. They seemed immature, under educated and trained into a tunnel vision of paranoia and psychopathy but they managed to maintain professionalism. There seems to be a new soldier class of cop on the streets; not swat, they&#039;re everywhere and with a serious military vibe. Then there are the others; the frustrated ones, those who have seen too much degeneracy and horror; they really scare me. Finally, there are the thugs; guys who would have been in street gangs but just happened to end up in an LE gig. There are also some fatherly types but in my experience they will turn bully-boy at the drop of a hat and are pretty much in the thug category.

				my dealing with cops has been pretty fair. Got caught hopping the train twice, the cops gave me a ticket but were cool about it. Another caught me with weed and let me off the hook since my birthday was a few days ago.<br /><br />There was this one bitch, who annoyed the shit out of me, just because she saw me using a student metrocard (card that gives middle/high school students 3 free rides per day, only usuable by students). this bitch saw me from across the train tracks on the other side, and the bitch came over just to check my card. nothing happened but the fact that i had a book bag and everything and she still decided to chekc that i was a student annoyed the hell out of me.

				I have had a considerable amount of contact with cops.&nbsp; I have found that, normally, if you treat them with respect then most of them will return the kindness.&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, you have your outlaw cops that are on the force to make as much illegal money and cause as much havoc as possible.&nbsp; But, those are not the norm.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh, and one other thing I have found out in the States.&nbsp; It helps to be a former Marine.&nbsp; ;D

				I&#039;ve never had any run-ins with the police that resulted in any charges...knock on wood.&nbsp; :P<br />But once I got pulled over, and I had forgotten my license, and the cop only gave me a warning ticket because I had a clean record.<br />Made me have some hope for a little while.

				There is sub-way type thing were I live. Usually when they ask me for my ticket I&#039;ll rummage around in my wallet and pretend like I lost my ticket. They usually start to take my info and then after a few minutes (before they boot me off (which they&#039;ll do at the next stop (and then continue to take your info))) I then miraculously FIND my ticket.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people who ride the train do not always have tickets and I feel that by stalling the cops I can keep them from getting busted (assuming they get off at the next stop). Once just because the guy was an ass to my girl and I we let him and his partner take us off the train and THEN I found my ticket. Wasted his time and probably saved a few people a fine.

				all good posts.<br /><br />there&#039;s really no good reason to be around cops, but in my experience being honest goes along way to getting myself out of shit.<br />i once dodged a driving under suspension ticket by telling the cop before he asked for my license that it was suspended.. i was just on my way to pick up mrs. curb from work. he didnt have to run my licence so he didnt have to arrest me. he let me go :))<br /><br />there&#039;s really no good reason to be around cops.<br /><br />

				most cops were beat up for their lunch money and now that they are cops they figure they are the power.Some are alright but you should never trust them get to close and they will run your name and see just what you are made of.I myself won&#039;t talk to them at all just my jail house mentality.You never talk to cops your friends might kill you if you are associated.

				I have found myself interacting with cops in past when I&#039;m up to no good (drunk underage years ago, pulled over with automatic jail time stuff in vehicle, etc) and every time they let me on my way none the wiser.<br /><br />I did get a sick satisfaction from pulling fast ones on them, not going to lie. <br /><br />Always be respectful, calm, and convey you see them as the authority.<br /><br />Then after they let you go, head online and badmouth the shit out of LEO on a forum&nbsp; ;D

				Here in Finland i havent encountered much &quot;corrupted&quot; cops but few bad occasions: Few times i couldnt when we were dealing with my friend cops took half of his money (about 400euros or so) and once my friend was baton&#039;ed(?) because he tried to flee by running by 4 cops and got pretty injured.<br /><br />My own experiences are pretty nice. Back in days when i had daily encouters with em they checked me when saw me, but i didnt ever have anything with me and it went well and with humor. Like others before me have said that when you treat cops with respect they usually treat you the same way and by acting that way you dont get that extra hassle that &quot;tough guys&quot; do when going all fuck the police ;) But yes, there are those usually young officers that are overeager and you cant even reason with them.<br /><br />Once i had trouble paying my friends fines(in here if you have unpaid tickets and they go over court date they get exchanged to prison time which is max 3months). He called from station that we needed to get there to bail him out before they ship him from police station to prison. Cops didnt like him very much and didnt let me or my friend inside the station, they just looked at us when we tried to ring the bell(it was really late so the station wasnt open and there was only macdonalds kind of communicator) we tried and tried but they just sat there, luckily when we strafed around one officer was returning to carpool and we knew eachother got us in and got that sorted out. Officer told later that his police friends asked why did he let us in and stuff like that :)<br /><br />sorry about my bad english.
