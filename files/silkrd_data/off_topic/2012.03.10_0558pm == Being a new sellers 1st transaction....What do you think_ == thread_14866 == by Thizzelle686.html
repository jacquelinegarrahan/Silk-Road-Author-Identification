				How do you guys feel about being a new sellers 1st transaction?&nbsp; I know its best to stick with a seller with good rep, but this guy is the only one that has the product that i am looking for.&nbsp; If i did decide to be the new sellers first order, what advice would you offer me as a buyer to help mitigate the risks i am taking.&nbsp; Even the best on here had to start out with 0 rep/transactions.

				Tried it once, and made a big mistake, but obviously that&#039;s only my experience.<br /><br />What I would do is first begin with small orders, or if the seller is offering free/cheap samples, start with those. NEVER finalize early for a new seller. If the seller says FE is mandatory, skip them altogether. Not worth the trouble. I hesitate FEing for trusted vendors now. A good suggestion to make for new sellers is to start a thread here on the forums introducing themselves and their product, if they haven&#039;t done that already. Communicate with them somewhat frequently, but not enough to become a pest. Most of all be respectful and understanding. When dealing with new sellers, most are probably beginning to get their system down pat. This means they are still testing various shipping methods, and would obviously result in delays. It doesn&#039;t always happen, but don&#039;t expect the package to arrive in record time. I usually give a vendor 1 week after my order was placed in transit to message them. This only applies to domestic shipments though, as internationals can take closer to 3-4 weeks with a really slow process.<br /><br />Most of all be smart about it, and trust your instincts. If you get a shady feeling from a vendor, or poor communication, or something seems off, then it would be best to avoid them altogether.

				If everyone thought this way, we wouldn&#039;t see any new vendors. If you stay within escrow, you should be fine. I think that all buyers should proceed with extra caution with new vendors, but just because they are new shouldn&#039;t automatically disqualify them. Think about where all vendors would be if everyone thought like that.<br /><br />Just use your common sense. Use escrow and you will be fine...

				I like using new vendors; they need good feedback so they usually ship next day and give extra.
