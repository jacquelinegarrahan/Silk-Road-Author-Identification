				I&#039;d be interested to know which countries are the best for &quot;off-the-grid&quot; living and are also pleasant to live in (no third world nations, please). This means, of course, the country does not have anything like an SSN, it does not require copious amounts of identification and documents to do simple procedures such as purchasing living quarters/land, cars, internet/television/phone services, paying taxes, and payments in cash or something just as simple are always fine. Also, as I have said, preferably somewhere pleasant, i.e. decent living conditions, minimal crime, and friendly people. I have never been outside the US and know very little about even the cultures closest to us (Canada, Mexico, UK), other than general information and stereotypes. What I mean is, I know very little about the infrastructure of any nation besides the US. If you live in an area that is like what I have described, please do not hesitate to give as much detail as possible. Thank you.

				Sounds like my dream country, but too good to be true. If there&#039;s any countries that fit your description they wont exist for much longer.<br />NWO needs to keep track of everyone and everything they do. <br /><br />I hope someone replies with a few good suggestions but i cant think of any.<br /><br />Maybe south America or Central America.

Personally I know of them both though I&#039;m sure with power and money you could do the same almost anywhere<br /><br />heck the sicillian mob has its own society compound/area in italy that not even the MILLITARY is allowed to enter.

For example, can I obtain a residence with simply a Canadian ID and some sort of other documentation (such as a passport, utility bills, etc.)? Are basic necessities in Canada able to be obtained in a relatively over the counter fashion with docs that could be forged.<br /><br />And yes I am aware of this in Mexico, and have heard good things as far as police corruption in India. However, I have no real connections in either place. And I&#039;m not sure how well a simple nudge nudge bribe to someone I don&#039;t know there would work - especially since I don&#039;t speak the languages.
