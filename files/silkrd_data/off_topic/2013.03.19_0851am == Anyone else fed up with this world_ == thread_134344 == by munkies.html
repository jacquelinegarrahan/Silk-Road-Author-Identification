				I hate this fucking world. When I&#039;m sober I realize how full of shit all this world around me is. <br />Everyone is talking so enthusiastically about the ne fucking pope like he&#039;s some kind of superstar, yet no one knew who the fuck this guy was a week ago. He did nothing all his life and now he will make history by doing just that. Stupid fucking religion!<br />I&#039;m also fed up with all mainstream media and all of consumerism. &quot;Normal&quot; people are looking down on you for using drugs, yet they feel so proud when they go shopping, buying shit they don&#039;t need, using their credit cards like they are giving away fucking candy. <br />And let&#039;s not forget to mention the government who always works in the best interests of the corpo...people! They&#039;re the worst. I&#039;d personally shoot every motherfucker that works for the government or state. They are simply unworthy of life. LEOs included. They are so proud to bust you with a few grams of whatever and treat you like a piece of shit for deciding to take control over your body chemistry. Fuck them! Just yesterday, before a seminar I heard a stupid bitch saying she wanted to go to the police academy before deciding to study economics, I couldn&#039;t help but call her a fucking bitch. <br />Sorry guys, I needed to somehow get it off my chest.

				&nbsp;&gt;:(&nbsp; HOLY SHIT TO ALL OF YOU, HOPE THIS IS ALL ABOUT BLOWING OFF SOME STEAM BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME. I HAVE A CAREER THAT DEALS IN DEATH AND BEEN AROUND IT FOR MANY YEARS. WHEN IT OVER IT&#039;S OVER. NOW LIFE IS BETTER THAN THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE POOR FOLKS SUFFERING FROM THESE UNGODLY DISEASES AND PAIN, BUT FIND ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND DOESN&#039;T HURT OTHERS, DIRECTLY, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE GET HURT JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM CROSS EYED.

				I&#039;m so glad that someone got around to making this thread. I&#039;m just honestly tired of Society. I mean yeah I have faith and hope and just I&#039;m not at all a sad person. I&#039;m just a happy person with depressing thoughts. But as I grew into a young adult I just realized how shitty the world really is. I&#039;m just afraid of getting old and getting tired of life. I&#039;m just afraid of working some shitty job just to get by. <br /><br />&nbsp;I know it sounds bad but I think of Heroin as my exit route. When all else fails, when all else hits rock bottom, when I hit a stalemate in life then I&#039;ll proceed to shoot a lethal dose to complete bliss.

				The world is just a range of multifarious possibilities. You make of it what you will. I have a few simple rules and policies which have served me well and kept me happy:<br /><br />As a hedonist, I extract the maximum amount of pleasure from my life and work hard to avoid engaging in things I don&#039;t like doing.<br /><br />Avoid religion, theist or deist beliefs.<br /><br />Surround yourself with the right people. Avoid people who expect you to share the burden of their problems if possible.<br /><br />Enjoy drugs sensibly but with abandon.<br /><br />Masturbate vigorously as much as you can as often as you wish.<br /><br />Make sure you have lots of sex and don&#039;t be hampered by taboos.<br /><br />A pretty simple outlook on life, but it enables me to view the world as positive and pleasant.

				You&#039;re right, the world is chock full of corrupt assholes looking to use just about anyone or anything for their personal gain. But guess what? Sitting there moping with a pessimistic attitude about it all changes nothing, only effects YOU and YOUR emotions for the worse. Find balance within yourself, drown out the distractions, and follow what you believe no matter what happens.<br /><br />The primary function of Government, television, even the internet, is to distract us from what we really are, and I&#039;m not talking about Humans. Find the truth within yourself, and you&#039;ll find that none of this matters to you and will not effect you. Control your emotions, do not become a slave to them.

				I used to be angry and pissed off at the world too. Then I made a series of changes and discoveries that changed my perception of reality in a way that I&#039;m not angry anymore. <br /><br />1. Started smoking weed. Opened my mind up to new possibilities. Still pissed off and angry, but more self aware with the drug.<br />2. Tried psychadelic mushrooms, changed my perspective of reality so much, I was awake for nearly 4 days and wrote pages and pages into my phone from all the realizations and epiphanies about myself.<br />3. Extracted DMT and blasted off. Changed my perception of reality again to a much broader picture. Started to really open my mind up to accepting that anything in my life could be &quot;wrong&quot; and I need to be aware. <br />4. Realized on an Ayahuasca trip that I was sick after the voice in my head kept telling me in a loop.<br />5. Learned I was 100% deficient in Vitamin D. Doctor tested me. I started high dose suppliment, and my sleep improved, my brain felt less foggy, I was a bit happier, and the world felt more &quot;3D&quot;, or I felt more awake and aware. My brain was definitely not happy running on 4 ng/mL of D25. I took 10,000 IU&#039;s a day for a month and got my level to 50 for D25.<br />6. Learned I am highly sensitive to GLUTEN. I decided to try to remove it, and within 4 days my blood pressure goes from 180/90 to 120/70, first time in years. I stopped biting my finger nails unconsciously without effort for the first time in 30 years. A sense of anxiety I never realized I even had, had lifted. I knew at this point, this was huge.<br />7. Lots of Changa, DMT, and Mushroom sessions every few months. Huge developmental growth each time. <br />8. Went Porn Free. Yep, This change actually is as big and as important as going gluten free. Social anxiety gone, focus problems gone, my energy is through the roof, I&#039;m sleeping better. I&#039;m not going to explain why because I&#039;m not here to defend this, I say this because most guys FREAK THE HELL OUT when you mention taking away their porn and start belittling me. So, Just watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU<br /><br />Life&#039;s pretty fuckin awesome now. I never thought I would be saying that, for the first 95% of my life so far. <br /><br />And here I am, out the other end. I smile all the time, I&#039;m happy. I&#039;m not angry at the world anymore. I&#039;m saddened by a lot of things, but not scared or angry. I&#039;m processing information differently, I&#039;m calmer.<br /><br />What I really learned, was, it&#039;s not about what&#039;s going on OUT THERE, It&#039;s all about what&#039;s going on in here, in my mind. Once I healed my mind in various ways, via deficiencies, or removing gluten (brain inflamation and binds as opiod to opiate recptors), or having deep self-psychotherapy via psychadelics.. all together it worked for me. I&#039;m not bothered anymore by the out there, because I&#039;m so damn peaceful and happy in here ;-). <br /><br />Spread the love! :-).<br />

				Of course the world is never going to be perfect, I know that, but it can be much better than it is today. Before I discovered silk road, the only drugs I could get my hands on were weed and shitty ecstasy pills, possibly mixed with pcp or some other shit. Now i can buy them from SR like I buy groceries. Is it too much to ask for a country that could leave you alone to do your own shit? Like not try to indoctrinate you all the time, feed you shit, treat you like a child by watching your every move and throw you in the dungeon when you finally decide to stand up to them. Who&#039;s gonna lead the island? Why do we need someone to lead, to tell us what to do, just so we can continue being slaves like we are today? Of course we need someone to manage the economy, to organize, we need people to make sure other people don&#039;t kill/rape/rob each other (aka cops), but i certainly don&#039;t need anyone to tell me what to do with my life, I don&#039;t need tv commercials to tell me what to buy, a bearded psycho with a bible to tell me what to believe and how to act, or some retard congressmen telling me what I can and can&#039;t put in my body.<br />Wake up people, we are living in a world where money is literally extorted from us in the form of taxes. We pay taxes for so called public services that nobody asked us if we use, need or want. We live in a world where I can&#039;t put whatever the fuck I want in my body just because some stinky old farts decided it was bad for me 60-70 years ago. Those are the same people that extort money from me. Fuck them!

				Thank you so much OP. I&#039;d say I have a pretty fortunate life (not rich) but I still feel like I&#039;m suffering. I live in USA and don&#039;t want to speak for other countries but how can anyone not feel like they&#039;re suffering? They are whether they know it or not. I&#039;ve lost faith in this society but I do find gleams of hope (SR is a major one). <br />However, one thing that has really been helping me lately is that when one dwells on all the negative, one is basically brainwashing themselves. I know I, for one, have been so caught up in how terrible things are that I&#039;ve been forgetting to (mentally) take care of myself. I know I can&#039;t do shit to change the world but one of my all time favorite quotes remains &quot;Be the change you wish to see in the world,&quot; by Ghandi.

				Funny buy I go mates who are Jewish and Muslim, Sikh, Hindu and some white witch who is spellbinding but not in a magic way she just looks so cool!<br /><br />With religion, best leave people to it but I agree that its annoying when you have to respect a religion just because someone says so. Anyone religious has to take criticism, lucky with Christians they have to forgive so I can tell my Christan mate I smoked all his Afghan black (I have really) and he will have to forgive. The dangerous religions are the ones which see other religions or the non religious as almost unimportant. In some nations your in danger of being killed if you start a rock band, say &#039;fuck God&#039; and have sex before married. Best be thankful of the little freedom we have in the West because some nations are fucked up, I mean, really fucked up.<br /><br />I actually done voluntary work with the Samaritans years ago, this was after a suicide of a close mate. The work was a mix of great and sad - it was great that people can their lives around, its all about how you see life and its easy to see it as a fucked up thing and to dwell on that too much.<br /><br />Life is about living it - whatever you as long as it harms nobody else then I am not opposed. People need freedom but we also need rules as there are bad people out there. <br /><br />Everyone has some view on life -&nbsp; religion is just mans explanation for this puzzle we call life. Science today has come a long way but its hard to see how life can just be some accident - a meteorite, a few chemicals and then Mozart! <br /><br />Maybe religion is like a lot of things - some truth but twisted by mankind for its own benefit. Trouble is people can always find some excuse to bully others. Religion can be like that or it can be tolerant, forgiving, all the shit it should be!<br /><br />A lot of religion is about control.&nbsp; Sadly as the world finds out more answers about life starting the argument does not really have much standing because in a few hundred years todays science will be laughed at.<br /><br />If there is a God then its your duty to enjoy life, to experience it in all its glory. Life can be great. All it takes is meeting the right people and having the ability to get along with people. Try not to get angry at this world - accept anger only when it serves as an inspiration for positive action. <br /><br />Try to have fn life! Leave the news alone for a while, its all depressing shit and makes the world sound like your gonna walk out of the door and get mugged, raped, assaulted and be the victim of ID fraud and catch some super-virus and go through military checkpoints. Funny how when I go out, some nights, its the pub and people are having a laugh and a drink and other things also as long as you do them off the premises. Rule of the pub. You get people using openly it causes trouble and gets your pub closed.<br /><br />So fuck the news and talk to people about local things. Plant up some seeds for Spring as its soon here and time for you to plant a natural medicine which makes life less shit!<br /><br />But, seems as this is SR let me warn you not to use drugs if your feeling bad. I&#039;ve done counselling and the biggest problem is lonliness, people not socialising enough. This is why you ought to go to the local pub at least once a week. Sitting in, reading the Internet, I feel like putting an RPG to my head or jumping into a volcano! Instead I go out and say &quot;Give us three of the usual and a treble Whiskey&#039;. I sneak out the back for a sly joint, leaving it outside so the next man or woman can have a smoke. <br /><br />Life can be shit sometimes. One of my buddies got told he was going to be doing at lest five years when he hands himself in. <br /><br />I broke some bones for work but after the initial morphine induced coma to get over the pain I&#039;m now glad to be alive and glad I never lost a limb, as I was told I was lucky. Great to be off the morphine, I know some here love that shit but I was almost sick as one night my buddies managed to sneak me outside for a joint. It hit me like a train, of course it was not smoking for a couple of weeks then smoking a fatty to myself. I did not like the combo of morphine and bud. Something called oramorph,, basically just like a liquid medicine though I was hooked up for a few days to a drip. Should have saved it and sold some here&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />So, chill out, life is many things - some good, some bad but it can be fantastic and I guess we stay alive for those times.<br /><br />And if you got nobody right now and not got much at all, remember, things can and do get better. And if its financial trouble, WTF are you doing here? I&#039;ve stopped using at times when I had fuck all. You just have to try and make things improve and I&#039;m living proof someone fucked up can kind of succeed. <br /><br />Life is what you make it and sometimes, like when you fall off a mountain and die, it is unfortunate. So, whilst your not falling off a mountain, enjoy yourself and be thankful your not some splat in the Alps<br /><br />At least be thankful for drugs - I could see a God at least doing us that favour! So Amen to that!

				The new pope is also an apologist and supporter of South American government death squads a la Argentina in the 70s &amp; 80s.&nbsp; The man deserves a bullet through what passes as his brain.<br /><br />Mass social uphevals are on the horizon, class relations throughout the world are strained to the breaking point.&nbsp; It remains to be seen if humanity can better itself or will degenerate into world war again, as happens in the end stage of capitalism.
