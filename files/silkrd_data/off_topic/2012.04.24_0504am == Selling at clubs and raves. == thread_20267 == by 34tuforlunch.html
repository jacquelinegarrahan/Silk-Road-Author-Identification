				So I thought I would make a little thread for people selling at clubs and raves and anything like that who want to share tips and tricks.<br />I started chopping all ages raves back when I was about 15 so I would say I am fairly experienced.<br /><br />I find one of the safest ways to sell is to work with some one who is also selling. At the end of the day you will usually make the same amount of cash because you are not competing and the chance of getting busted is decreased by a lot. One person handles the money the other handles the drugs, this will confuse most security guards just make sure the person that is holding the drugs does not interact with you to much during the night. The only real downside of this is if you are selling to people who are not regulars in your scene they may not trust you or think you might just run of with their cash. I also recommend the person holding the drugs be female, security is usually male and the chance of you getting a heavy pat down is less. <br /><br />When holding keeping your drugs properly hidden will save you a lot of cash, in the last 2 years I have seen probably around 2000+ caps of molly get flushed down toilets.&nbsp; Keeping a bag of 100 caps in your pocket is not advised, The best place for men to hold is in the crotch pocket of briefs. heres an example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxNs3WGbNNw<br />All briefs have a similar design just put your hand halfway through the pee hole thing and reach down. For women the best option is to usually modify a bra. the best way to do this is to cut a small hole at the top and to slip whatever you are carrying behind the cushion. I personally keep a large baggie filled with 10 smaller baggies&nbsp; that usually have 10 caps each in them in my crotch. I take out 1 bag at a time and put them in a pocket or something. That way I have easy access and if security catches me the most their getting is 10 caps. When taking a bag out or adjusting them always go to the washroom stall and have someone keep 6 for you. My first and only bust was security looking over a stall at me and taking all 80 of my pills.<br /><br />If any one else has any tips, tricks or story please share.

				Invest in a pair of these: https://stashitware.com/<br /><br />Then wear a loose belt/jeans combo, and you&#039;re pretty much untouchable.<br /><br />If I were wanting to start selling mdma, what&#039;s a good way to do it? How much do you put in each cap, and how much do you charge for a cap? Do you just go around the rave saying &quot;mdma?&quot; to people, is it that simple?

				It really depends were you live, the most profitable and safest place to sell is an all ages rave. Reason being kids don&#039;t drink they they do drugs and they dont have to pass tests for work and all that. Make your price similar to other dealers I don&#039;t know were you live so I cant tell you what you should sell for but I usually sell 100mg caps for $10 each and I get ounces of m for $640. If your product is to cheap people will assume its some rc. Just walk around and ask people thats what I do. If theirs undercovers at the places your selling to don&#039;t offer males ages 22-30 with short hair and have the generic cop look. Their honesty quite easy to recognize as their not their with friends they dont drink or dance much. If security catches you with your stash don&#039;t resist handing it over or they will call the cops.

				125mg in each cap if its pure like most molly on here i find is a good rave dose its not too much but just enough where even higher tolerance people will roll. And i find that the best way to do it is go up to the person and after the sell is made walk off and let them get there money ready the only time i seen people get busted was when the customers take there fucking sweet time and are so obvious about getting there money ready so dont stick around for that just make a quick sweep when they have there money ready and walk away its really easy i usually sell 500-750 each festival pretty easily.

				in my state, raves get raided by the feds, but they never flush your drugs. thats just crazy and none of securitys business. <br />i took my buddy matt who works on an oil rig to a rave once, he smoked a cigarette indoors, and this bigass bouncer they called bumblebee told him he had to leave, so he flicked the cigarette in his face and they started fighting and 5 bouncers jumped him and left him for dead in a drainage ditch. but no cops ever came. he was all tweaked out so when he came to he was all like, i got 200 on your roosters! i was like...thanks guy. lol <br />also ive seen people sell at festivals like electric daisy carnival and not get busted, and i mean just passing shit out and taking money. also, make friends with the security. one time i asked a security dude if me and my buddy could smoke a blunt in this little corner and he said take it outside behind the bouncy castle. lol <br />i don&#039;t know where you guys are going...but it sounds terrible. lol

				Yea bouncers will sometimes take stuff, If I know a bouncer is stealing drugs and keeping or themselves me and&nbsp; 3-4 friends will usually jump them after the event is over and take but everything they have stolen. Sometimes you get lucky and can get up to $1500 of drugs split between 3 people. Bouncers that keep the drugs annoy me a lot more than bouncers who flush them. I can respect a bouncer than flushes them for doing his job but if they steal them their a douche.

				This is a drug dealing based forum and honestly selling at clubs raves is quite safe&nbsp; because police are never really involved. If you get caught the worst that ever really goes down is you loose your stash and are kicked out. The one time I was actually caught I wasn&#039;t even kicked out lol.
