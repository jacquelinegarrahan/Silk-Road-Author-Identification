				Story of my life this place. <br /><br />Allow me to share some of that story.<br /><br />This has been my second day on SR and I am very happy to say I have finally arrived here. 15 years have I been using drugs which started at the age of 13 when I had my first weed. <br /><br />That first pure weed joint (that got me baked like nothing ever after side from some isolator I had years later that almost gave me the same hallucinogenic trip I had the first time) was my introduction to mind altering substances. Since then I have experimented with pretty much every form of recreational drug. I was 15 when I had my first E&nbsp; (holy batmans the first times anything are the most intense). Next narcotic up in the list was a tiny bump of speed I had once after school. Brought me into a total chill that first time (however I am not in any way diagnosed with ADHD or any other psychological disorder). Speed most certainly sped me up the times after. Never got drawn into amphetamines. I LOVE the drop of a good E or pure MDMA in the right setting with music and vibes but they are very occasional and very consciously intended when I do them which is rare. <br /><br />Mushrooms! These little earth gems connected my soul with my source. I have always been, I always am, and always will be. Everything is. There is no separation. Anything is what you want it to be with focused conscious intention. Believing makes it real.<br /><br />Atomic harmonics is the name of the game and the next buzz I got was from cocaine. Snorted it first when I was about 18. Sharpened my senses those first times, brought me into a euphoric state. It&#039;s everything but &quot;Nike, just try it&quot;. This is where I suppose you could say the doing began. Some 2 years later I smoked it for the first time and another holy batmans occurred. This was a turning point. Nothing is ever the same after you have smoked cocaine. It changes you for the better and for the worse. Hard do I find it, to describe in words how my life has changed since that day. This is a subject I would like to enlighten more about in following threads but for now, let&#039;s keep this as a nice smooth ride of an introduction of newways shall we. ;)<br /><br />So. Heroin. Smoked it a couple of times when coming down off of freebase/crack. Do not like it at all. Same goes for weed after having smoked it many many years. I simply do not enjoy being caved, stoned, walled, floored, downed, dampened, whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />I enjoy being vitally vibrant, alive, happy and in a state if well being. That said, next thing I tried was crystal meth. Tried it 2 times and they say it is many more times an intense rush and euphoric than smoking a rock of blow. Must be me myself however to me it tasted like speed and that so called &quot;buzz&quot; also did not do it for me.<br /><br />Only other drug I have done other than the named above was a good line or two of ketamine at an according dubstep party. Wicked! And yet again I feel I can and will stay away from substances that on the long run contribute to the deterioration of my physical.<br /><br />On the long run I will be completely drug free. I know this. <br /><br />B.A.S.E is the kind of thing I want to be addicted to. Hurdling myself off of Buildings, Antenna&#039;s, Structures, and Earth to give myself that ride, thrill, and after chill in the most &quot;natural&quot; forms possible (many other dynamic hobbies included).<br /><br />Smoking cocaine however, is something that I still struggle with. The utmost clearest of intentions do I set with this community to break myself free, educate myself and others to overcome the unnecessary and return to the natural essences of life.<br />The will and the intention combined with the good feeling of achieving these goals are what are going to make it happen.<br /><br />This has been my introduction to Silk Road. <br /><br />I have always been here for me and you, always am and always will be.<br /><br />Cheers everyone<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
