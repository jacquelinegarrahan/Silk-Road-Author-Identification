				Mining for bitcoins doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense for most people, unless:<br />1) You already have a new/fast ATI graphics card in your computer.<br />2) You have inexpensive electricity costs OR you don&#039;t pay your electric bill.<br />3) You don&#039;t need bitcoins now - you certainly won&#039;t be mining enough to buy drugs unless you wait 6 months.<br /><br />New specialized hardware is close to being released that will probably eclipse any casual mining from graphics cards, so I DEFINITELY wouldn&#039;t buy any new graphics hardware now just to start mining.<br /><br />BUT, if you want to give it a try it&#039;s pretty easy.<br />1) Chose a mining pool such as 50btc.com. Sign up and get pool info.<br />2) Install mining application onto PC that will be performing the mining. An easy to use one is guiminer.<br />3) Put pool login info into mining application, hit go.<br />4) Come up with explanation to tell people why your computer sounds like a vortex and is +10 degrees warmer than the rest of the house (graphics cards running at 100% are loud and kick out a lot of heat)

				As deep987 says, it&#039;s not that efficient to start mining with GPUs .. even if you have all the requirements he said. <br />Given the case you do, and/or you want to try, you should be careful and search a miner wich you can tweak the &quot; agresivity &quot;&nbsp; , so the GPU is not that stressed.<br />That&#039;s something you should really pay attention to... because if you start mining and there&#039;s and the fan doesnt&nbsp; cool down the GPU propertly (dust on the fan) , you&#039;ll fry the GPU.<br />The best is to start slowly, underclocking the GPU (really easy in AMD cards) and setting agresivity to low, and setting the fan to 100% so it cools down better.. and then rising the agresivity little by little... and if you can rise the clock to the normal rates too. That way you&#039;ll reach a point where te temperature is constant in time. It&#039;s a matter of tweaking.. and in most miners it&#039;s really easy.
