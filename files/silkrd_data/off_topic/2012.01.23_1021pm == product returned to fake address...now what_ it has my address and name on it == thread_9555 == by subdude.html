				should not have let it get returned... theyll find out it a fake address and im sure if it gets opened your maill will be watched somehow. if it comes leaking drugs on the mail mans hand ill still sign for it... because at least i can say i just didnt know what it was o well. but whatever you did or didnt do to get it sent back is your own fault and now wondering is what youll do. if you would of got it at least you knew where the shit it was. in your hands and not in LEs

				If it was &quot;undeliverable&quot;, then it&#039;s not your address, right? You get your other mail? <br />Or, they&#039;re waiting for you to come ask about it. <br />

				I work in a sorting office in the UK, when stuff gets returned there it gets sent back to the address at least 3 times before it is returned to sender. Their view is that anyone (neighbour etc.) could have messed with it and they have to try at 3 times.

				forever i never thought there could ever be a problem with sending&nbsp; c/o ( in care of ). addressed to my name in care of father at his house of course. i had like 20 problem free deliveries at home, but to break things up a bit so my mail carrier wouldnt experience so many parcels. once i start doing this i get 2 undeliverables according to address. it shouldnt have happened as long as addressed correctly. one went back to thailand...so big whoop. i believe the addresses were mishandled. im feeling still a bit leary....but i dont think there&#039;ll be a long standing problem. i have a test parcel on the way with tiny illegal. lets see if theres some sophisticated machinery just waiting to kick out my parcels.......i wish people would quit trying to use people mailboxes for their drug pick up.&nbsp; &nbsp; LOL
