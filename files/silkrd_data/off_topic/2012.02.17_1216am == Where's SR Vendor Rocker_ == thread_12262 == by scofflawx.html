				Still here guys. :)<br /><br />I just got into a pickle investing all my real-world USD into product, then selling the product and receiving a bunch of BTC, then I had delays turning back into USD.<br /><br />So I&#039;ll be back and better than ever here as soon as I&#039;m able to cash up, I went way overboard selling product when I couldn&#039;t get the cash back fast enough to reinvest.<br /><br />&lt;3<br /><br />Rocker

				Hey everybody!!!<br /><br />I&#039;ve managed to improve my cash flow situation to some degree so I&#039;m ready to come back :)<br /><br />Missed you all!<br /><br />I will be relisting mushrooms at some point on Thursday. <br /><br />My supply of MDMA has not materialized like I was promised yet, so I don&#039;t expect that to be listed yet unfortunately, and I&#039;m not sure when it will be, but I have hope.<br /><br />Rocker

				YES! Glad to hear you&#039;re back on track! I tripped this past weekend on another vendor&#039;s shrooms and it just wasn&#039;t the same. Just became a fan of your vendor page, and I&#039;m looking forward to making a generous purchase.

				Haven&#039;t had a free weekend yet to sample your product. Perhaps this weekend. <br /><br />Added you to favorite vendor list. Took me a bit to find you since you had no listings. <br /><br />Glad that you&#039;re all good and coming back.

				Yeah, I got totally flooded with orders.<br /><br />I got a little crossed up between yesterdays and todays orders, so I&#039;m going to be marking them all as shipped tonight. Many have already gone out, but have not been marked.<br /><br />I just need to have the addresses handy so I can be sure that no order is left unfilled<br /><br />Thanks y&#039;all and sorry for any confusion.<br /><br />Rocker<br /><br />
