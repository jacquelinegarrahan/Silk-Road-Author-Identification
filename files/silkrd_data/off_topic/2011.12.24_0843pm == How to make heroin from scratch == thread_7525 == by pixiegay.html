				Hello!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;m interested in getting into the trade since there seems to be no one in the market here from my country and I reckon it&#039;s about time there is some available! <br /><br />Basically I want to know everything about the production of pure white heroin. What type of plants will I need to grow? Where can I get seeds for these plants? Best growing conditions? Best lab equipment? Etc.<br /><br />Cheers!

				If you don&#039;t have any sort of chemistry background, I&#039;m sorry to say that it&#039;s probably not a feasible idea...<br /><br />You&#039;re going to also need somewhere where you can grow a large amount of opium poppies with relative safety.....why am I even explaining this to you? There are a million tutorials online, but once again, if anyone could just walk off the street and start manufacturing &quot;pure white heroin&quot; don&#039;t you think there&#039;d be a lot more of them?

I plan to grow them in a secretive controlled environment in bulk so it will minimize the danger associated with the whole operation. Sure there are millions of tutorials online; but keep in mind each of those apply to different types of poppys, which is why I asked here in the first place. I want to get a recommendation on what sort of seeds to get from whom, what are the best growing conditions for this type of poppy and what is the best way to prepare the heroin, etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m positively sure that silkroad would give a more in depth answer than any answers on that of the surface web. However if you or anyone for that matter has any links to reasonable guide on dark/the surface web then please feel free to share it :P

				Sorry, but I am sarcastic by nature. ;)<br />The poppies with the highest alkaloid content seem to be any variety that are bright red, or the giganteums that are a pale white with a pale bluish/purple center. The Danish Flag variety also have a high alkaloid content.<br />Any of your pure purple variety&#039;s or any of the peony type have low alkaloid content like the &quot;Hungarian Purple&quot;. Also, Papaver Bracteatum AKA Iranian poppies have a higher thebaine content therefore not suitable for heroin production. <br />Also, one thing to consider from what I have read is that 12&quot; apart is optimum spacing for strength. At that distance though you will have fewer &quot;tillers&quot; which are the secondary smaller pods that sprout off. Thereby giving you fewer pods but higher morphine content per pod.<br />One more thing I have noticed is that poppies actually fare worse in highly enriched soil. They seem to actually enjoy being made to work for their nutrients.<br />And once they start to flower, stop watering as that will loosen up or dilute the latex.<br />That&#039;s about all I know pod wise.<br />As far as the chem side goes surely there are some on here that can help.<br /><br />Good Luck!

				I looked in to that once and found out that it takes a 100ftx100ft room filled with poppie plants to produce a gram of heroin!&nbsp; Same with cocaine!&nbsp; Thats what the &quot;experts&quot; informed me.&nbsp; I didnt like hearing that, but I would love to prove them wrong! ???
