				Sure You can pass it as your own&#039;s, but there some risks involved,<br />1) id need to be really good quality, similar to original and all names, datas should be the same.<br />2) don&#039;t know exactly about usa, but such instances like police has own database where original photo is located, and if they check - nothing helps. also you need to be near the same age.<br />3) and if original owner will get fine or busted somewhere in his state and after an hour your fake id will be checked in another state when you located, they just say wtf, you just were miles away hour ago?:)<br /><br />think you understand, there pretty much risks involved, so better think.

				As soon as a cop runs your name or ID they will see a picture of your cousin...&nbsp; It&#039;s not the 60s anymore.&nbsp; We have technology and law enforcement utilizes it...
