				It does look pretty shitty and not well constructed but I might start using it if SR keeps going down all the time.Like literally half the time when I try to log in the website either cant be found or it wont let me log in even if I create a new account.Its just really inconvenient and annoying.

				I don&#039;t wanna sound like a smart-ass but people, don&#039;t become a slave to fanboyism, use both platforms and most importantly use your brains. Not getting scammed is easy.<br />You can&#039;t imagine how much money I&#039;ve saved by comparing listings on both platforms.

I think it&#039;s a good idea when a vendor puts up a contact address just in case the worst did happen. I contacted a few of my all time favourite vendors reminding them to add an emergency Tormail back-up address. I even started to collect ALL of the current vendors emergency back-up addresses in a small doc on my USB stick. I posted a thread saying that, &quot;in the case of SR permanently going down, I&#039;d make my current list of vendor back-up addresses available, to people who emailed me&quot;. It would only contain vendors that wished to take put in this back-up scheme, I appreciate some vendors wish only their current customers to have this back-up address.<br /><br />Anyway, the response I got to this idea in my thread was quiet under whelming, to say the least! No-one cared or was interested, so as the project had a fair bit of work involved, I just wrote that idea off as one of my more stupid efforts! At the moment I just keep a list of my personal favourite vendors, just in case. But, like someone said, Silk Road is looking more stable than ever and with DPR releasing the back-up URLs the other day, I really can&#039;t see it being taken down without a fight. LONG LIVE THE ROAD :D

				That place is too sketchy for me, so many scammers. It&#039;s like a REAL black market lol, people making empty promises all the time. I try to vend there and I get shitty customers, I rather deal on SR and get less money but more loyal customers.
