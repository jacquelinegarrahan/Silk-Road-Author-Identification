				Concerning virwox.com:<br />&nbsp;Your first two Paypal deposits are going to take almost 48 hours due to manual verification. Afterwards they start letting it through right away with random manual verifications thrown in occasionally. The random verifications seemed to get done a lot sooner than the first couple you do. You also start off with a low deposit limit of $20 if I recall. After that your limit increases as you successfully make deposits and conduct other business on the site. The number of days since your last PP deposit also affects your limit. They state your limit increases a bit for every day between transactions but I didn&#039;t notice that aspect in action as my limit went up from use. I&#039;m up to $500 at a time as of three days ago.<br /><br />Something to be aware of: FEEs and market manipulation<br />You can&#039;t directly buy BTC with a Paypal deposit. You have to buy Linden dollars (second life digital currency) first, then buy btc with the LD. You end up having to pay transaction fees twice that way. Depending on the amount you&#039;re trying to deposit, it is still sometimes cheaper to get btc this way than paying 4 bucks for a moneypack + SR coin merchant fees and btc rates.<br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed a lot of price manipulation going on within the past week on virwox when the BTC jumped to around 4 dollars. You may make out much better by placing buy orders and waiting a bit instead of just trying to have your orders filled instantly.

				The only method I know to use paypal to buy bitcoins is a bit risky, but I&#039;ve done it a number of times without an issue - only for small amounts (10 bitcoin and under)<br /><br />here&#039;s what I&#039;ve done:<br /><br />hang out at one of the exchanges with a chat room, or one of the irc-channels. I mostly use btc-e for my trading, so I know some of the regulars. chime in asking if anyone wants to sell &#039;X&#039; bitcoins for &#039;Y&#039; dollars each via paypal. if the transaction size is small enough, someone will be willing..... assuming you&#039;re offering more than market rate. <br /><br />Keep in mind that it&#039;s risky for both sides - The buyer could wait until he gets his bitcoins and dispute the charge.... he would get his money back. The seller could simply accept the paypal funds and send nothing.<br /><br />Now, if you&#039;re in the US - you can use bitinstant.com, you make a cash deposit at a Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, or Citibank branch - and have the funds (less their service fee) put into your tradehill account, where you can buy bitcoins and send them wherever you want.<br /><br />Bitinstant rocks - you can call or email them 5 minutes after you leave the bank and they&#039;ll fund your transaction on the spot.&nbsp; I think the service fee is 5% or something.

				generally not a good idea, I exhausted the search for a Paypal to Bitcoin supplier when I first heard about SR if it wasn&#039;t for Intersango (straight up deposit into their account. browse BTC vendors. make payment) I wouldn&#039;t even be here.<br /><br />the main issue is chargebacks...although BitCoinOTC + VirWox sound good might give them a go if intersango ever shut down...I think i&#039;ve got too used to not paying any fees...

				Paypal is probably the most unsafe way of purchasing BTC, but it can be done if you really want.<br /><br />As stated, virwox.&nbsp; I&#039;ve used it myself and it works fine, it just takes them up to 2 days sometimes before they will approve your purchase of BTC with SLL which is an absolute PITA.&nbsp; If you watch the rate SLL and BTC are going for you can actually play a little forex with virwox and make substantial money (eg. price of SLL crashes, buy all the BTC worth you have of SLL, wait, sell for way more BTC once the SLL price goes back to normal ... and it will, so long as that game exists).<br /><br />The only other place you should consider when it comes to paypal is the #bitcoin-otc marketplace in IRC.&nbsp; You will need to setup an account, authenticate with the bot, and then wait 24 hours before you can verify and be given permission to speak in the channel (+).&nbsp; As of late though i&#039;ve seen that system more or less fly out the window since until just recently there was no demand for BTC.&nbsp; With no rating you may be able to get a few people to sell you 2 or 3 BTC to help you establish a rating.&nbsp; Once you have a number of good transactions people will sell you any amount of BTC for paypal .... a sickeningly amount actually.<br /><br />The main problem is chargeback fraud, and there&#039;s little you can do to protect yourself because Paypal has publicly announced that it does not recognize bitcoins as a &#039;real&#039; currency.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy for a buyer to make a chargeback claim on something that Paypal doesn&#039;t recognize, they&#039;ll approve the chargeback claim and there&#039;s one more screwed seller.&nbsp; <br /><br />From the seller vantage point, well first you shouldn&#039;t sell BTC for Paypal, if you don&#039;t know why you should get out of the game.&nbsp; The ONLY tiny thing i&#039;ve come across that helps you argue your case should a chargeback claim tribunal occur is to make the buyer send you the money as Personal -&gt; Payment Owed.&nbsp; This is acknowledging that no actual goods have been exchanged, and if the buyer does try and scam you through a chargeback claim, there are no tangible goods for them to claim, and they also admitted freely that it was the personal exchange of currency (chargeback claims cover goods, not currency or services)<br /><br />Moral is you just shouldn&#039;t use Paypal period.&nbsp; If you are American there are like 500 options available to you, i&#039;d check SR first, all you need is one of those moneypak things that I imagine are in most stores in the US (i&#039;m not American, my journey into obtaining BTC was far more painful) and a reputable vendor, of which there are many.<br /><br />Stay away from Paypal !!

				I agree, fuck paypal.<br />If you&#039;re dealing with SR, there&#039;s almost no way to avoid any bank fees but paypal and so on are just too much to support the system which will do anything to keep you away from the great experience of life. <br />Everyone who&#039;s from EU, the best way is Intersango as I don&#039;t now the US options but there are something for USD too if you don&#039;t find anything better. https://intersango.com/fees.php
