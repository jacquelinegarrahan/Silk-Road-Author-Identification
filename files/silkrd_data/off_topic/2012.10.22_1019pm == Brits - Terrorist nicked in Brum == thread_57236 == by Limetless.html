				Not heard about it. But if they are terrorists they don&#039;t even deserve to go into prison, they should just be taken out far to sea and dumped.

				Hahaha nobody has heard anything about this? Check the news, they were caught in Birmingham so it&#039;s a bit like trying to blow up a budget chicken and mushroom pie but still yano, it&#039;s a terrorist plot.

It just surprised me how little people seem to be talking about this because if this thing actually happened it would have probably made 7/7 look minor. Also they apparently contemplated attaching blades to the front of a car so it had some Wacky Races humour in it too! <br /><br />&quot;We will re-enact this cartoon skitch in the name of Allah!&quot; HAHAHHAH!

				I have been reading the coverage in The Telegraph (clearwebalert) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9625623/British-al-Qaeda-gang-from-Birmingham-planned-another-911-in-UK.html# It&#039;s unbelievable and absolutely disgusting, they raised funds through bogus street charity collectors. In terms of suicide bombers, in my opinion they do not deserve the pleasure of prison, I don&#039;t know why they&#039;re not taken to a field, and individually blown up, after all that was their goal in the first place, and it&#039;s cost effective!
