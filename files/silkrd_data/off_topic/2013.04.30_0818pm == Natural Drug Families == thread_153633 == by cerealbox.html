				So I was thinking the other day. Opium isn&#039;t just one drug. It has morphine, codeine and thebaine as it&#039;s main drugs, though there&#039;s lots of other opiates in there in smaller amount including heroin and vicodin (don&#039;t quote me on those last two, I&#039;m having difficulty refinding the source of that info). Marijuana isn&#039;t just THC. There are shitloads of cannabinols and terpenes, and terpinoids in there as well. Kava contains a bunch of related drugs called Kavalactones. Sure, some plants just have the one drug in there.<br /><br />Anyway, it got me thinking about the drugs I use. Generally I don&#039;t use a lot of natural drugs. I love dissociatives and psychedelics and I was thinking about what kinds of chemical mixtures might you find if you ate a piece of fruit from the Ketamine tree or drank the tea of the 2C-Flower? is there any rhyme or reason to the kinds of drugs produced by cannabis?<br /><br />For anyone who&#039;s had real opium, how does it stack up to taking straight-up isolated pharms?<br /><br />Sorry for the weird question/discussion/post.

				I&#039;ve only had real poppy tea and I found it kind of different from pharmaceutical opiates.. A low dose made me really energized, which was probably because of the thebaine, and higher doses gave me a lot of nods but not much euphoria... The poppies were homegrown and probably not fully ripe too so that&#039;s maybe why it wasn&#039;t so great.<br />I guess the difference between the plant and the extracted substance is like the difference between strawberry aroma yogurt and yogurt with actual strawberries in it. It has more than just one aspect to it I guess.<br /><br />And there&#039;s no diamorphine in opium, the morphine in opium is in the form of another ester. The hydromorphone in it is only is minute amounts that wouldn&#039;t affect anything I think, there may also be traces of hydrocodone (vicodin). Either way, the psychoactive molecules in a plant often have the same base structure.. In the ketamine fruit you&#039;d probably have some research chemicals closely related to ketamine in their structures and stuff like that. The 2C-B flower would probably contain Meth2C-B or some kind of cathinones with a bromine at the same position?<br /><br />The best way to find out exactly what the differences between plants and pure chemicals are is to try san pedro and then pure mescaline, Psylocin vs. shrooms, etc. I know there are a lot more active molecules in cacti than mescaline so the high must be relatively different.

				Using a lemon or vinegar in your poppy tea it will acetylize(diamorphine) and make it quite a bit stronger.

				Opium is more of a dreamy, magical feeling really. Take an oxy or morphine sulphate pill and its just a straight out euphoric gouch. But with opium its kinda like a mystical experience. like a general sence of wellbeing. I find the itching a lot less with opium, and dunno, its hard to tell, I think because your consuming a wider variety of alkaloids the experience for me seems more whole, like more fulfilling. Not to say the morning after / comedown is a billion times milder than like H or morphinne<br />ACE

It&#039;s just the way it&#039;s used in your metabolism that accounts for several similar chemicals to be created, and the same goes for plants or psychoactive animals like frogs and toads. In a valium plant you&#039;d probably find diazepam, nordazepam, chlordiazepoxide, prazepam, and other closely related benzos. I don&#039;t think there&#039;d be alprazolam in a valium plant because they&#039;re not that closely related. You could also find other molecules that aren&#039;t benzo-like at all that are also be psychoactive.
