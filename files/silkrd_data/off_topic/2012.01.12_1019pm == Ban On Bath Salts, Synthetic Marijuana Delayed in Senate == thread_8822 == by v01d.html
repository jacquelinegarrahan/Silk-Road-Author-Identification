				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Approval last month in the U.S. House of Representatives of legislation that would prohibit the sale of synthetic marijuana and other drugs known as “bath salts” and “plant food” has been delayed indefinitely in the Senate, American Medical News reports.<br /><br />The House voted 317-98 on December 8 to ban the synthetic drugs, which can mimic the effects of marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamines; however, the Senate companion bill has been held up by an objection from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).<br /><br />Public health officials and physician groups support the legislation because they maintain there is no known medicinal use for the substances, while use of the products has led to numerous medical emergencies.<br /><br />The American Assn. of Poison Control Centers reported 5,853 calls to poison centers that were related to bath salt exposure from January to November 2011, a dramatic increase from 303 such calls in 2010. The American Medical Association announced its support of a national ban last June.<br /><br />&quot;These chemicals, when inhaled or injected, cause effects similar to those caused by cocaine and methamphetamine, including paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal thoughts, which have led to self-mutilation, violent behavior and several deaths,&quot; wrote AMA Executive Vice President and CEO James L. Madara, MD, in a September letter to the House supporting legislation banning bath salts.<br /><br />More than 30 states have enacted laws banning the synthetic drugs, which go by brand names such as K2, Spice, and Vanilla Sky.<br /><br />Some lawmakers said they oppose the legislation as it is written because of its potentially “chilling effect” on scientific research.<br /><br />&quot;These drugs need to be controlled, but they need to be controlled in such a way that there is no harm done to the vital scientific and medical research that we count on,&quot; said U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/News/Daily/Pages/ND0110123.aspx

A chemical compound&#039;s properties derive from its composition and shape, and have absolutely nothing to do with if it was produced naturally by a plant, fungus or animal, or in a lab. Psilocin extracted form a mushroom and psilocin made in a lab are identical. Your distinction is as arbitrary as saying &quot;ban ALL drugs with name slonger than X syllables and legalize ALL the other ones&quot;.

				+1. this is similar to the organic food movement where people eat/like things solely because they are natural. yes this is generally a good idea but there are plenty of natural things that are terrible for you. the notion that something is &#039;natural&#039; is not a good enough reason to like it. poison ivy is &#039;natural&#039;. some types of mushrooms are terrible for you but they are &#039;natural&#039;.

I use epsom salts in my bath because I get bruised/cut from work almost every day (lots of physical/manual labor at a minimum wage job) because I can&#039;t afford medicine such as ointments and stuff like Vaseline/Neosporin. Epsom salts are the cheapest way I can heal my injuries and if I can&#039;t do that, then I can&#039;t work. What the fuck is this bullshit?

The implied &quot;bath salts&quot; means RC&#039;s / designer drugs labeled as bath salts to get around the law... Not epsom salt or ACTUAL bath salts.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Oh, LOL. I&#039;ve never done drugs and I don&#039;t know anything about them so I just thought that they wanted to ban epsom salt because it was being synthesized into drugs or something. Sorry.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Hahahaha it&#039;s not a problem that&#039;s why I asked if you were being sarcastic or not!<br /><br /><br />But yes drug manufactures are making substances chemically similar to cocaine and methamphetamine but aren&#039;t classified or controlled under the federal Controlled Substance Act. They&#039;re labeled as &quot;therapeutic bath salts&quot; and have the warning &quot;not for human consumption&quot; but are sold entirely to be misused as psychoactive stimulant aka drugs.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

A chemical compound&#039;s properties derive from its composition and shape, and have absolutely nothing to do with if it was produced naturally by a plant, fungus or animal, or in a lab. Psilocin extracted form a mushroom and psilocin made in a lab are identical. Your distinction is as arbitrary as saying &quot;ban ALL drugs with name slonger than X syllables and legalize ALL the other ones&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />spot on old chap... spot on
