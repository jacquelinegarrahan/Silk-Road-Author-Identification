				Hey all.&nbsp; Just looking to see who&#039;s left out there.&nbsp; We&#039;ve been trying to relocate our set up to a couple of other sites, however our coins all were seized in the shut down.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for someone (or a few people) who may have some coins that they would be willing to loan out for us to get our vendor&#039;s license up in another marketplace.&nbsp; (We have plenty of product and would be willing to reward said lender very generously.)&nbsp; The fee we need for the license is currently 1.65 BTC.&nbsp; If anyone would be willing to help us out, please post here or send us a pm and we can negotiate the logistics.&nbsp; As my page is not viewable, I don&#039;t have much more than my word that I&#039;m not a scammer.&nbsp; When the site was seized I was a well established vendor and had been there for 1.5 years with a 100% / 5/5 feedback rating.&nbsp; There are several reviews of my account on the forums as well.&nbsp; I understand that I am asking a lot, but this is really the last course of action I can take.&nbsp; If you&#039;re reading this and think you can help, please consider.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Bamann
