				Maybe like REX with a rail canon capable of launching a nuke? <br /><br />Also Metal Gear Rising looks rediculous, who the hell is going to play that?

				I read this as &quot;Is it possible to buy an actual metal gear?&quot; <br /><br />I was like, the fuck is this guy on<br /><br />But yeah I&#039;m sure if someone had the funds it could be done (Building one I mean)

				Haha I am pretty baked. But im playing mgs3 and I was just thinking about how it&#039;s very plasable idea being able to launch a &quot;stealth nuke&quot; around the world. Especially with today&#039;s technology.

				The KGB had suitcase nukes in the cold war, that&#039;s pretty damn stealthy, far more than a &#039;rail cannon&#039;....I don&#039;t play MGS, but when you say &#039;rail cannon&#039; I&#039;m thinking of something along the lines of the Gustav Railgun from WWII....nothing stealthy about that. I mean shit, we have &#039;stealth&#039; bombers, China as well now, that are capable of carrying nuclear payloads.

				Well MGS3 is all about the cold war (that&#039;s why IMO its the best in series) and espionage. But I know of reports of the KGB trying to make suitcase bomb. Kind of reminds me of the sum of all fears. But I wonder a stealth missile from a rail cannon?

				Rail Guns aren&#039;t possible at the moment, Saddam tried to build one but it didn&#039;t work out very well.

				I was pretty sure I heard that the US army invented one that can shot metal slugs. But I do believe we probably are behind on build one capable of launching a rocket, let alone a missile.

				http://www.reuters.com/video/2012/02/28/us-navy-kicks-off-rail-gun-tests-with-a?&amp;videoId=230957596 <br /><br />The video should work. But I think my friend told me about this before. I was like imagine if the US wanted to build a gargantuian sized one. But I don&#039;t think we&#039;re quite there yet.

				Well that&#039;s fucking wonderful isn&#039;t it. Now the world doesn&#039;t just have to worry about the U.S starting World War III with it&#039;s foreign policy, them extraditing you to their prisons or maybe if you are lucky chucking you in Guantanamo is you have a funny beard and a tan now we ALSO have to worry about them throwing big metal shells at us with electromagnetism and hate as well. <br /><br />My Friday has not started well.... <br /><br />EDIT - Although saying that, at least a British company built it. Can&#039;t help but like that.<br /><br />EDIT - And to be honest, I would love to fire that at Mister Dank&#039;s house while he was on the toilet taking a shit while reading the paper.

				It is a very interesting concept, especially the idea of using electromagnets to launch something so huge. But no nation could really get away with launching a nuclear attack. So it would kind of be pointless to put the effort into something that big. Don&#039;t ya think?
