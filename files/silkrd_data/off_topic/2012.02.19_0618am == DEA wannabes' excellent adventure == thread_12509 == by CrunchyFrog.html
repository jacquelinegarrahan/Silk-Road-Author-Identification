				I thought some might &quot;enjoy&quot; this tale of three Junior G-men getting their para-military on in search of the demon weed.&nbsp; Although presented in first person as true, one has to wonder -- as did one letter-to-the-editor writer -- if this is simply DEA propaganda.&nbsp; If real, I think the author should count himself lucky not to suffer a 230-grain headache sometime soon.<br /><br />(Links to the full article, photographs, and subsequent letters to the editor below the quote.)<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: The San Diego Reader</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">CITIZEN POT BUST<br />Hikers find 16,000 marijuana plants<br /><br />By Chuck Harper<br />Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2012<br /><br />&quot;This is Steve Reed with the DEA,&quot; said the man on the phone.<br /><br />“You called the DEA several months ago about a possible irrigation line you found in Cuyamaca State Park,” he continued. “I have a Post-it note on my bulletin board with your phone number.”<br /><br />“Ah, yeah, I did call that in,” I hesitantly confirmed.<br /><br />“What do you think it is?” pressed Agent Reed.<br /><br />“Well, it was an irrigation tube about one inch in diameter, buried in the pine straw and way off the main trail.”<br /><br />I thought about the spring day my two hiking buddies and I were off-trail, crashing through dense thickets of tangled brush. It was growing dark, and the three of us had gotten separated. I stopped to rest and happened to look down and I saw a plastic pipe. I wondered why an irrigation tube would be way out there.<br /><br />To the agent I said, “I followed the black pipe for about 20 feet before it disappeared into a thicket. At first I thought the park rangers were watering trees or something, but I wised up when I saw how well hidden it was. I hooked up with my buddies, and we returned to check out the hose before we headed back out to the main trail.”<br /><br />“Can you tell me how to get there?” Agent Reed asked. “We recently had a bust at Cuyamaca, and I’m trying to find out if it’s the same location.”<br /><br />I’d read about that bust in the Union-Tribune, one of the top five drug busts in San Diego County, a marijuana field with a street value of $300 million.<br /><br />“No, it was too remote, real thick brush,” I said, “and it was getting dark when we left. But I think I could find it again.”<br /><br />“That would be great.”<br /><br />“When do you want me to look for it?”<br /><br />“Tomorrow.”<br /><br />...(continued)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Story and photographs: [ sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/feb/08/cover-citizen-pot-bust ]<br />Letters to the Editor: [ sandiegoreader.com/news/2012/feb/15/letters ]

				You&#039;re right...<br /><br />They&#039;re very lucky to be alive.<br /><br />16,000 plants would be worth protecting.

				It wasn&#039;t written by the hikers.<br /><br />I can&#039;t be sure but it just doesn&#039;t feel like some hiker wrote this, seems more like a professional writer&#039;s work, some one who knows more about drugs than your average non-consuming citizen (&quot;The THC resin got on everything&quot;)<br /><br />It&#039;s possible that the story has been expanded upon by a journalist but I&#039;d be surprised if it&#039;s not a story that was written, paid for and planted by the DEA.&nbsp; Just the last bit about never hearing about a reward from the DEA, well that might incline you to believe it&#039;s true, however then carrying on with their super hero work in another park for no pay and with high risk, it just sounds like a lot of bull and shark.
