				I was thinking I&#039;d buy a stolen PayPal account from PayPal Store; 5xhp3ntcxfpfd5ig.onion(can anyone here testify to their legitimacy?). Only You know, the money is on a Paypal account. How could I get that shit laundered and into my PayPal/bank/CC account? <br /><br />One idea I had was making a new account, and listing a fake item for whatever amount I had. Then buy that with the hacked account, and then sell another fake item on my legit account to the newly made account, and it&#039;s newly received money (all this would happen on ebay, of course).

However, if you were to either do it outside of ebay, I think you could send the money to an mt.gox account, then send that to an instawallet, then through something like coinfog, then to an external wallet. I&#039;m not sure about how mt.gox goes about investigating these types of things, but it may be worth a shot.<br /><br />sdesu

				Why on Earth do you need to launder Paypal money as long as it&#039;s under 4k a month they don&#039;t give a shit.<br />Also purchasing stolen property is a rookie mistake, esp. if it has to do with currency exchange.<br />If your money is getting on Paypal from Moneypak why not just use a Moneypak debit card?

				Ok, not exactly money laundering more like taking it and hiding where it went to.<br /><br />So, Just off the top of my head and in no way am I an expert.<br /><br />Use Paypal to fund a Virwox.com account. (FREE Account but use a hotspot) <br />Buy L$ (Secondlife game) with it.<br />Create a free Second Life (www.secondlife.com) account and login to the 3d world. Find a terminal and withdraw the L$ into your SL account<br /><br />Create or use a second SL account, give the L$ to the second account. Or use the second account to set up a simple store with free items in SL so the first account can buy stuff from a store that the second account owns.<br /><br />Use second account to create a virwox account and transfer the L$ back into virwox<br />Convert to bitcoin and move around a bit or to USD and out to another paypal account.<br /><br />If it was me, I would convert it to bitcoin and then buy gold or silver through coinabul or buy stuff on SR.<br /><br />Again, I am in no way an expert on this. This is just the idea that comes to my mind.

It must be a limit on the USD into virwox. I did not use a pay pal for my Virwox account, I went from a free second life account into virwox and deposited about 250k L$ to buy bitcoin. I did not run into a single limitation on it.

				Yeah, I believe the limits only apply to Paypal and credit card deposits. SLL, Bitcoin, and bank transfers are unlimited.
