				Curious, in your opinion, does SR administration retain information that should be anonymous, (e.g. addresses and PMs) as with the spirit of this site?&nbsp; If so, and this site is &quot;taken down&quot; will not the enforcement agency have all related information? <br /><br />As a follow up, is it a policy that SR monitor PMs? <br /><br />Just looking for opinions and or thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Addresses are destroyed when an order is marked shipped, and it is always recommended that they be encrypted with PGP to the vendor, in any case.<br /><br />PMs are pruned after so long, and in the meantime they allow the support staff to see evidence of threats, to more effectively protect users. They&#039;re not regularly monitored, they are looked at when a particular complaint is made and the PMs are relevant.

Anonymous admins are still anonymous, and as such cannot be trusted any further than you can encrypt them.
