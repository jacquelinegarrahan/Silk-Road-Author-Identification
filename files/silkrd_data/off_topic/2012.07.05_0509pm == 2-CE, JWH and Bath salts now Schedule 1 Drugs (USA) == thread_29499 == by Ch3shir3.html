				Found this extremely interesting, but apparently the notorious Synthetic Drugs act was passed by congress last week (June 28th). The main goal of the bill was to schedule the JWH and Bath Salt families, which in my opinion was a good thing (I&#039;ve had experiences with jwh over doses, not a pretty sight). But the other thing i found interesting was that 2-CE got lumped in with this bill. There are supposedly 3 incidents of 2-CE related deaths, and from my research i found that the first one was an absolute complete over dose, like pushing 300mg+, yet the other two it was strongly suggested they didn&#039;t ingest 2c-e at all and got their shit from a phony RC site. Honestly, just from my experiences with jwh and 2c-e, in my opinion, 2c-e is significantly safer and it looks like congress just added it to the list in all the hoopla of the synthetic drug scare.<br /><br />idk, just my rant

				Can&#039;t say I&#039;m too surprised, and honestly I&#039;d rather do the real drug then fucking synthetics, ew.<br /><br />But I AM surprised that 2c-E was put in there, but no other 2c&#039;s?

				Not just 2C-E, also 2C-H, D, P,&nbsp; N, T-2, T-4, C, and I. There are some rarer ones that they didn&#039;t catch, but they got most of them. 2C-H is probably the most important, since that&#039;s the precursor for the rest of them.

				Yea generally synthetics are just fucking bad news, the only reason i had my day with JWH-018 was I was a younger kid afraid of drug tests, shit was awful. But honestly with the 2C&#039;s they didnt seem to have that same... i don&#039;t know.. edge i guess that other synthetics have, you know like a sense of falseness or something a long those lines. What&#039;s interesting about this bill though is it supposedly leaves like an opening for them to efficiently schedule new compounds as they become known.

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but aren&#039;t all these compounds mentioned analogues of schedule 1 drugs to begin with, and already illegal under federal analogue law? Anything that is a pro-drug or precursor, what have you of a schedule 1 substance is illegal under the analogue act. So this is just a permanent scheduling? I find it suspicious that the Miami Bath Salt zombie incident occurred before this being enacted. The story was undoubtedly hyperbole to get attention on the issue and to ease the adoption of the ban.

				I checked scheduled drugs in Canada yesterday and i found out that a compound name is &quot;Thebacon&quot; or acetyldihydrocodeinone. Reference: http://lawuyss-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-23.html#h-26<br />So guys don&#039;t come to the Canada with thebacon in your car&nbsp; ;)
