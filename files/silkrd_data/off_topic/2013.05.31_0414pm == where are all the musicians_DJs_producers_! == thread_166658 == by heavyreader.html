				just wanted to start this thread to try and see how many other SR users are musicians/djs/producers, professional or otherwise.. PLEASE don&#039;t say enough about your music for someone to draw a connection or link to it online anywhere.. just tell us a little about yourself and how long you&#039;ve been doing music shit and what you&#039;re into, i think it&#039;d be interesting to see just how many of us there are on here (i&#039;m thinking quite a few, creative people just tend to like drugs for some weird reason..&nbsp; ::) )&nbsp; <br /><br />myself, i make rap instrumentals (808 mafia, zaytoven, mike will made it, etc) and rnb tracks (think quiet storm type of shit, just more contemporary).&nbsp; i DJ&#039;ed and produced dubstep for a long time, started in like 07-ish, and kind of just got really sick of the scene.&nbsp; but i&#039;m in a very central location for that style of rap music and was raised listening to it, and always made these beats on the side (god i must&#039;ve been producing for over 11 years at this point), and now it just so happens that i&#039;m lucky enough to be making some pretty alright cash engineering and producing for local artists.&nbsp; i feel very blessed in this respect, i actually wake up every day and can&#039;t wait to start my job, and at night, if i&#039;m not up til 6 am working, i&#039;m thinking about my work constantly, itching to get back in the studio!!&nbsp; i&#039;m still very young by most people&#039;s standards, so ya like i said, blessed to the extreme.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />enough about my shit, i wanna know what yall are all up to.. just be discrete!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				ketamine fucking RULES to make music on.. and speaking of techno, last time i did K i was listening to the new sandwell district fabric mix, and i was pretty speechless, me and all my friends were..&nbsp; awesome--&nbsp; <br /><br />also ableton is a super fun DAW.. i really like the way it works, if i wasn&#039;t such a born and bred MPC dude then i would use it more often.&nbsp; but there&#039;s just something about the MPC workflow that i will never be able to give up, being able to pump out a great track in a couple of hours without ever having to stop the beat just feels good.&nbsp; <br /><br />what kind of techno are you into??

				I&#039;m a big fan of making heavy electronic music while on LSD.&nbsp; I&#039;m making banging out songs right now with some kavinsky-style/spatial music (I like to keep things continuous but varying) but I don&#039;t think i&#039;m up for trying keta... Just weed and LSD for me ^.^ Maybe one day i&#039;ll try DMT, but not anytime soon.

				I suppose I&#039;ll be the first player of analogue instruments to speak! I play guitar, bass and a bit of keys. Most regularly, I play lead guitar in a very jammy band. We take influence from Broken Social Scene, the (mostly 90&#039;s) Flaming Lips, the Beatles, and of course, Phish and the Dead. Really, we love psychedelic rock and pop music. I&#039;ve tried my hand at production of music along the lines of early Aphex Twin and Locust Toybox, but my patience wears thin quick. I love the immediate immersion in improvised jams. <br /><br />I wish we could share our music, I&#039;m sure so many of you guys make such interesting creations.
