				Remember when you used to take one little white pill and it would make your eyes roll back in your head as you came up so hard that you nearly fell backwards? Remember when you’d spend a whole night asking strangers for massages, combing other people’s hair, and convincing yourself dance music wasn’t crap? The clichés are now about as dated as the drugs are shit. An edgy twitch is not the same thing, and I’m sorry, if you’re under 21, you probably can’t understand what we’ve lost.<br /><br />I was having this whinge to a dealer friend (who we’ll call Julio) about the current poor condition of the drugs market. Why Julio, I asked, is it not possible for your chemist brethren to create some pills that actually live up to their name? I want to actually feel ecstatic. I want joy in a pill. Give me “endless feelings of gooey warmth and happiness”. If I wanted a short-lived buzz followed by six hours of sleepless terror I would take speed.<br /><br />Julio explained why it is that our pills are piss poor, and why MDMA has, for the last three or four months, taken on an uncanny likeness to speed. Shock, horror – they can no longer make MDMA. I wouldn’t have believed him if it hadn’t been confirmed by three additional dealers, all who advised me to ignore anyone claiming to be selling MDMA, unless they had buried it in a hole a year earlier only to sell it now in the high-demand market at inflated prices. One component of the compound 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, which was only legal to produce in China, has been made illegal to manufacture over there, making it near impossible to track down.<br />This has lead to every crooked chemist in the land coming up with shitty concoctions to feed us. That is why the MDMA is now mostly MDMC, tastes sweet and only gets you high enough to remind you how good real MDMA once was. Equally, they are packing those pills – which were already bulging with all sorts of non-kosher stuff like ketamine – with every possible substitute. Julio is just a dealer, not a politician, and doesn’t know when the situation will be sorted. I’ll leave the final words to Julio: “Just think about our kids, man. They’ll never know what the real shit was like.” (from Viceland)<br /><br />Health warning... MDMA no longer exists.<br /><br />(text taken from http://safercapetown.blogspot.com/2010/09/mdma-where-have-all-good-drugs-gone.html )<br /><br />So, is this true? No more REAL MDMA? Maybe chemists or cooks can answer this question?

				Also I think that MDMA should be the same every time it&#039;s synthesised. Not weaker, not stronger but the same. Chemistry is somewhat like mathematics..<br />I&#039;m searching for quality like described.. &quot;...would make your eyes roll back in your head as you came up so hard that you nearly fell backwards&quot;.

But some blog making sweeping claims based on the anecdotal evidence of a couple of idiot street dealers? Nope.

				This is also a 2 year old blog ... alluding to a situation occuring a year before that even.<br /><br />I think they are referring to crackdowns on the production of safrole. That part has some truth. But there is lots of ways around that.

				Well, is there a sudden drop in Sassafras Trees? Safrole is the primary precursor in the production of MDMA is it not? Unless we&#039;re seeing a shortage in this key ingredient then WTF? Time to start planting some Sassafras trees now peeps, that way in the future they&#039;ll be trees for the workers to harvest and give over to the chemists, suppliers, dealers etc and ultimately to the future youth n such. Ahh yes I can see it now....hahaha

				Is it fair to ask how SR vendors products are cooked - with safrole or with anything else? And how or with what they are cut if they are not pure? And product purity too. I guess I&#039;m not the only one ready to pay X times more for the best quality - real stuff.
