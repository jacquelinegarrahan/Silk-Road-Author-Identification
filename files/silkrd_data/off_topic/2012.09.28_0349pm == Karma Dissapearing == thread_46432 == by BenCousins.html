				no its not glitches, the reason was clearly explained. <br /><br />the only way it occurs is if someone changes the feedback the gave you within the 72 hours.<br /><br />if you give someone a negative, and then try to give them a positive the next day, it takes away the neg and puts it as a positive

				Maybe you dont realize it LL since you claim that you dont give a shit about people you havent met, but referring to MM with the suggestion of Hitler is the most absurdly disrespectful comment you could ever make. Do you fucking realize what you said and how incredibly insulting, rude and hateful that remark actually is?&nbsp; <br /><br />LL Just because you reacted to being corrected in an immature and arrogant way doesnt mean you can act like such a prick.<br />Maybe if you would read the post with an attitude of helpfulness instead of one of arrogance and sarcasm, you would have interpreted it differently... <br /><br />And this is not something that should just be tolerated or &quot;you can leave...&quot; It is not acceptable to harass and insult members so frequently with such a disrespectful and hostile attitude.&nbsp; No matter what the interaction or even whether you disagree... You should always show respect to all other people, especially members of this community<br /><br />MM &gt;Absolutely nothing was done to deserve such an insulting response. Nothing disrespectful like &quot;cant you read&quot; or anything hostile was even mentioned. I agree, some people will just read the last post and not realize what was actually occurring. Some people just enjoy being ass holes, try not to let em get to you.

				Just because I have a respect for others and wont tolerate harassing members for no reason means I deserve to be disrespected as well?<br /><br />I replied because everyone is making comments like MM was trying to start something and by posts it is clear he was just trying to be helpful. MM even freaking ASKED what he did wrong and you all just continued to insult him and be rude. It is uncalled for and not the appropriate way to conduct yourselves within the community. <br /><br />I am a troll because I try to be honest, helpful, and for some reason respect other people. <br /><br />If you think it is funny to refer to the holocaust you obviously dont have the same appreciation for human life that I do. It is not something to insult someone about just because they were trying to contribute to the community.
