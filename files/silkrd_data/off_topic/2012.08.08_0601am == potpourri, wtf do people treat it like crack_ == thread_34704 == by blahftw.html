				This shit has been all over the news lately, and cops are trying to scare people into handing over their stash.&nbsp; The head shop i work in has decided to quit carrying it in the store, and i have been selling it on the street, hence my recent absence.&nbsp; But hey, gotta make that money, right?&nbsp; Anyway, i tried the shit, and personally don&#039;t care much for it.&nbsp; We&#039;ve had the new age bang bang, and the most wanted k4, of all flavors.&nbsp; I tried some of the k4, and personally don&#039;t see how it can be called synthetic pot.&nbsp; The buzz is far more of a trip, then a high.&nbsp; It almost reminds me of salvia, but less intense.&nbsp; Anyway, has anybody else had any experience with the stuff?&nbsp; My customers treat it like crack, and blow me up 24/7.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t get it.

				What don&#039;t you get about it? It&#039;s just a load of cuttings laced with synthetic cannabinoids. Make the solution, dip the shit, dry it off, stick it in a jazzy lookin packet and sell. Rinse-repeat. :)

				I could probably get by capping moxy with vC, but is considered an analogue schedule 1 narcotic here in the states.&nbsp; I&#039;m looking for stuff still under the radar, that ol bill can&#039;t nic me for.&nbsp;
