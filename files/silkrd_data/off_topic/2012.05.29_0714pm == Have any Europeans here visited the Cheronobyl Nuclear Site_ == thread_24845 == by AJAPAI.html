				An uncle of mine has been there. Getting in there wasn&#039;t very difficult, only have to get permission from some agency but that was quite easy. <br />Really weird atmosphere, it&#039;s a ghost city. A place where like 50.000 people used to live, and leave everything behind in 15minutes. <br />Craziest thing he said was the big wheel standing there :P<br /><br />No need to wear a special suit or anything, since radiation isn&#039;t that high anymore.

				hmm sounds kool. there is an american movie that just came out recently called chernobly diaries and i havent really heard about it before since im fairly young but i was doing research and it looks sick. Just imagine a huge music festival in that town that would be awesome everyone would be rolling so hard because of the creepy vibes and shit.

Just imagine a huge music festival in that town that would be awesome everyone would be rolling so hard because of the creepy vibes and shit.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This might be the best fucking idea ever ;D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The site itself is buried under tonnes of concrete although the background levels of radiation are through the roof! I spent some time Belarus and Russia and saw the devastation it caused to people even hundreds of miles away - all the more reason to get rid of nuclear energy and stick to green alternatives like solar and wind power!<br /><br />V.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The concept of nuclear energy in itself is actually really good but the way it&#039;s been done in the past few decades is bad. Using uranium or plutonium as fuel is an outrageously shitty idea. I suggest everyone here to read about thorium reactors:<br />http://www.thorium.tv/en/thorium_reactor/thorium_reactor_1.php<br />In my opinion solar power has no future unless there is a major scientific breakthrough soon and wind is and always will be a supplementary source of power. The only &quot;green alternative&quot; with serious potential is biomass-derived methanol and ethanol. That stuff would truly be 100% CO2 neutral because the plants bind CO2 from the atmosphere in their biomass using solar power, which can be extracted in the form of energetic substances like methanol and ethanol, which in turn can be burned, releasing the solar energy and the CO2.<br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You do realize that is exactly what we are doing when using fuels derived from oil, right?<br />Think about that for a moment...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Of course I know that... The obvious problem is that new oil is not made as fast as we use it. Also, burning alcohol doesn&#039;t release toxic gas and particles, only CO2 and water:<br />C2H5OH + 3O2 -&gt; 2CO2 + 3H2O
