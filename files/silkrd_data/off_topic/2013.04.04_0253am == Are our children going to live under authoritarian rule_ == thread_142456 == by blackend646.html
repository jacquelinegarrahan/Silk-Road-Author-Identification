				I am reaching a stage in my life where I would love to become a mother. But with the state the world is in today, with talks of domestic drones, SWAT teams busting down the doors of the innocent and shooting their dogs, warrantless wire tapping and manbaby politicians telling people how much soda they are allowed to consume I can&#039;t help but have serious doubts. Civil liberties seem to erode more and more every day, and thanks to the brainwashing of the liberal media the commonfolk sit on the sidelines and enthusiastically cheer it on. It&#039;s hard to imagine what the world is going to look like in 20, 40 or 60+ years, but with the direction things are going I just cannot honestly imagine that the future will be bright. <br /><br />I want my children to be free, I want them to have total control over their own minds and bodies, to pursue their dreams and enjoy the beauty that is life uninhibited by the greed of some miserable statist bureaucrat or the baton of a douchebag rent-a-cop with a Napoleon complex. <br /><br /><br />Do you believe that the rise of the nanny-state can be, or more importantly, is going to be stopped? Have my years of being marginalized for my personal choices turned me into an alarmist?

				Hey,<br /><br />My wife and I feel the same way.&nbsp; We had only one boy because we don&#039;t want to bring many kids into an uncertain future.&nbsp; One kid we can take care of extremely we&#039;ll with university and all the finest.&nbsp; More kids means spread thin and few opportunities for them and struggles. <br /><br />You can fight back with grow ops, bit coin, Silk Road, anonymous ,&nbsp; etc. you are a part of this revolution right here and now.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your kids will be talking about you and how us guys stick it to the man with using Silk Road in our day.&nbsp; In their day, in the future they will have teir time. <br /><br />All you can do is keep fighting.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give in.

				Do you believe innovations like Bitcoin are going to be able to stay ahead of the curve? The way I see it, the states lust for power is never going to stop. As technology advances they are going to exploit it to make their chokehold on our lives stronger and stronger. You are right about what our weapons are against them, but I have to wonder if we will be able to keep up. It&#039;s all very frightening to think about

Nothing is perfect in this life. You just do it anyway. Tomorrow&#039;s too late to reconsider. <br /><br />Napoleon was one of the most ingenious war generals to exist. He was a fore-runner for Truppenführung, a field manual for combat strategy. Atilla the Hun employed his divide and conquer strategies many years ago but he implemented them a lot better. Germans tried this in WW2 but seem to have failed. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142456.msg974009#msg974009">Quote from: blackend646 on April 04, 2013, 02:53 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Do you believe that the rise of the nanny-state can be, or more importantly, is going to be stopped?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No. To both questions. <br /><br />Have dem kids. :)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Have dem Kids ;)

				More rich white people complaining about their first world problems of not being able to buy drugs and soda.<br /><br />You all need a little historical and geopolitical perspective. We have it pretty damn good compared to the vast majority of people who have ever lived.<br />
