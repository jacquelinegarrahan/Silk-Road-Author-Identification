				Ok post any ideas on how to get new users and more use. No posting about health or legalization ill put a post for both. If this post gets to cluttered spammed ect feel free to make another.<br /><br />I&#039;ve tryed throughing out of my truck newspaper like pages of http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html&nbsp; in peoples yards only like 10 of the full thing (most got far into peoples yards)and like 100 of the first page the first page ones like made it to the sidewalk sometimes only in the street by the drivers side door of peoples cars. also 100 http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html with how to make it http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/brightstar.mdma.html with how to make it and the url on the back. It didn&#039;t seem to get anybodys attention even tho I live in a small town of like 5000 to 10000 (idk) the newspaper had nothing to say about it 4 days latter and my family said nothing about it. If you do something like this make sure nobodys behind you when you through something out the window I was driving like 15 in a 25 through a small pamplet out the window and a car was like a block away i didnt think it was a cop but it was clearly when i got to the stop sign i even think they saw me through something because they sped up and so did i then at the stop sign i turned and wasn&#039;t followed. It took me like 4 hours I guess to get that many out.<br /><br />Idea #2 buy ads and put like ecstacy is safe use it instead of hard drugs.(idk) Ecstacy can be used safely get the facts at http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html. Have fun and be safe with ecstacy get the facts at http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html.&nbsp; Get the facts on how to use ecstacy without harming yourself at http://www.thedea.org/neurotoxicity.html. Id say the last one is my favorite. Not sure about putting http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/brightstar.mdma.html (brightstars method of making ecstasy which im going to use) in an ad if somebody would be mad maybe sue me arrest me idk and of course putting the silk road in an ad. If people think that ecstacy isn&#039;t bad for them then I think they will find the rest.<br /><br />If anybody has a workable way to make mdma for the average person please put it on this post.The http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/brightstar.mdma.html&nbsp; way to make mdma might not be doable because you need to ship Dimethylformamide to a business address. <br /><br />My other posts are (drug harm reduction charity for increasing good drug use, evidence that mdma is safe).<br /><br /><br />

				I think that the propaganda that ecstasy will destroy your brain is amoral like its doing alot more harm then good and with no good reason behind it but to the casual onlooker its a moral service to tell people that its bad. I don&#039;t understand why its really been given so much negative press I can say that 3 health board heads of like their government said it wasn&#039;t harmful (look for the articals on google). Id say that telling people ecstasy will destroy your brain makes people believe that using the drug however doesn&#039;t make a difference too how much damage is done when using it without a temperature will cause no permanent damage and possibly short term memory loss and trouble concentrating for 3-4 months if used to often. I wish I could tell that to people who spread false information that ecstasy will destroy your brain or somehow get it in the public view that people have been lieing and probably hurting peoples health to try and get less users when more users that know how to stay safe would be better.<br /><br />Look on http://www.leap.cc/about/who-we-are/ about the war on drugs and how its doing alot more harm then good.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />Im interested in improving good feeling and reducing bad feeling simply.I want to put, &quot;don&#039;t believe the propaganda ecstasy can be used safely&quot; on billboards or in any way that will reach people. Mmm the best way to get money for this that I can think of is to start a charity aka if you don&#039;t know charity&#039;s are their what rich people donate too so they pay less taxes. If I made a charity that&#039;s a drug harm reduction charity I could afford things like billboards and commercials. Honestly I just thought of and solved my problem but it would be alot of work and im thinking of selling mdma on silk road to start and grow it for some time.Ive looked at charity&#039;s budgets for hours and the charity&#039;s websites for some time I&#039;d say that their isn&#039;t many that make a million dollars a year or over that are any good even bad for people alot of the time by destroying their economy or so I hear.<br /><br />New post for a drug harm reduction charity.

				It&#039;s an uphill battle. I give loads away and don&#039;t make any money from it, yet even that doesn&#039;t remove the negative views and associations that most people have. It has been illegal and in the shadows for too long, so there hasn&#039;t been enough research and there has been so much crap passed off as MDMA. And honestly, although I am all for saying that it can be used safely, I am personally not sure where the balance rests between saying that, and taking into consideration that it&#039;s a powerful drug and some people will still find themselves in bad or unsafe scenarios as they all ready do with legal drugs.

				First, stop using the word &#039;ecstasy&#039;. That word now covers a whole range of unrelated drugs, some of them hazardous. Call it MDMA.
