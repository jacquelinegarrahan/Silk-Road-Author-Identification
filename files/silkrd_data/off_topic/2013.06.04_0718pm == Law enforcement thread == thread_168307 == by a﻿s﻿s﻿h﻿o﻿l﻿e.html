				they are out to get us....lets not make it personal with them. They might work harder.... as of right now I feel pretty confident with SR cause DPR does not allow dangerous stuff like weapons or CP. Which is great, it keeps a little heat off us(for things we believe is our right to put in our body) but calling out individual LEO....might just attract more attention.<br /><br />no offense to your post

I have already explained the reason why people are not allowed to post the personal details of ANY person, whether they are LE or not. That reason is clear and concise, and a matter of Silk Road policy. In fact I explained that to you when you were posting child pornography stories everywhere, one of two things that are not permitted here along with posting the personal information of yourself or others.<br /><br />Libertas

This is what we&#039;re up against, people who are awake. Pakistan has nuclear weapons, Iran is trying as hard as they can, the sea is swallowing inhabited areas at a disquieting rate, guns can be downloaded, and this is what most people still are. <br /><br />Those who are awake: We have inherited a long procrastinated ethical responsibility to shake humanity from its fugue, we can no longer simply observe.
