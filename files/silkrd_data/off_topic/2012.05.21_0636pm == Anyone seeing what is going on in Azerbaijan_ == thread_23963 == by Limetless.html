				Basically the government is going all out to prep for the Eurovision Song Contest, really laying it on thick and rolling out the red carpet!<br /><br />So far we have had -<br /><br />Anti-democratic demonstrations being suppressed<br /><br />Protestors being beaten and killed<br /><br />Forced evictions from homes in the way of the state oil company<br /><br />Homes being demolished to spruce up the capital Baku and people being evicted<br /><br />Oil &quot;Security company officials&quot; (private army) battering journalists <br /><br />Musicians and other media figure campaigners being forced into exile<br /><br />So yeah, think I&#039;ll be giving it a miss this year. Only + from Azerbaijan, the women are fit and the caviar is pretty damn good. Other than that, denied.<br /><br />

				I have not heard anything about it, it might have been smashed between the big news stories of the day (as CNN sees it) of some gay kid killing himself because his gay roommate was spying on him through his webcam and the protests (Yea, another Occupy &lt;whatever&gt; protest) in Chicago over the NATO summit with Obama and the President of Afghanistan.

				Ah well basically it&#039;s corrupt as fuck, they don&#039;t allow free speech. It&#039;s basically pretty much a Mafia-State. <br /><br />President does have a FIT daughter though - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyla_Aliyeva<br /><br />I&#039;m watching this documentary on it now and they planted cameras in this female political activist&#039;s bedroom and blackmailed her with films of her bangin. Very harsh but the activist was really fat so it was kind of darkly amusing at the same time<br /><br />The presidents family basically owns everything, his daughters are directors of the main telecommunications company, gold mines, hotels, real estate. As I say, complete Mafia-State.<br /><br />
