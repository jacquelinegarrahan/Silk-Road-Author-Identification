				Since so many of you seem to be genuinely curious about LE and exactly how they operate, I thought I would share my experience. <br />I sold weed for years, yes only weed, and eventually attracted the attention of the DEA in a major US city. Although I probably cant tell you too much that you dont already know, I am hoping this enlightens most of you to exactly what you need to be aware of when dealing with LEO. <br />Some questions I may not want to answer because it could compromise me completely, I am aware that by making this thread I am taking quite a risk as I was told by the DEA specifically to never mention what they did to me. However, I care a lot about all of you, how can I not? We are all so similar and we need to unite more now than ever so that LEO stops treating us like criminals and more like the mentally ill addicts that most of us are. <br />So ask away...

				I would like to hear more about this, not really sure what to ask you though?&nbsp; Care to elaborate?&nbsp; I would love to hear anything you have to share, but don&#039;t really know what sort of questions to ask.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; How did you ultimately get busted?&nbsp; How much weight were you moving?&nbsp; If you could of done something differently what would it have been prior to getting busted?

				Yeah man, tell us your story.<br />You only gave it like 20 minutes after your first post.&nbsp; People were just waiting for follow ups that are more detailed.<br /><br />So far all we know is that you used to sell weed and that you got caught.

				Also I am rather busy today but will be checking this thread now and again to help answer any questions. Its been a long and winding road to get where I am today and I hope this is helpful to us addicts so we know what we are up against. I dont fear them anymore, they cant hurt me now that Im not having seizures all the time.

				You say they were focusing on whom you were getting the product off of, that&#039;s quite typical. There may have been some larger picture going on in the agency(ies) and you how some people can be, how they lust for career advancement and will stop at nothing. Possibly even resort to violence. <br />Most cops from where I am, think north, are nice people who joined the force for a legitimate reason and have no stains on their name. Maybee they roughed up a violent drunk guy but that comes with the job. What I&#039;m attempting to convey is that you shouldn&#039;t let your hatred of a few bad apples generalize to a hatred of a people. I agree, &quot;fuck the cops!&quot; in the figurative, what with the fighting oppression and the get go

				I agree undekka. I have long been a proponent of non violence but when I think about the way I was treated, I can only imagine how many people they do this to each year and get away with it. I was hospitalized at the end of it all because everyone just assumed that I was delusional and making this shit up. What kind of people allow that to happen? Low lifes thats who. And thats what we are dealing with here, a bunch of low life bullies who will abuse someone to show off in front of their colleagues and maybe get a fucking promotion. They arent all like that, but I would say most of them are from my experience. <br />Oppression is the main problem here. Not only are blacks and latinos locked up a thousand times more than white folks, over a fucking plant, but those of us who are mentally ill and really need help dont deserve to be bullied by a bunch of hot head cops. So I sold pot to my friends, is that really worth spending the resources to systematically harass me for years? The ends dont justify the means. As far as Im concerned right now they can add one more casualty to the long list of casualties that is the war on drugs. <br />My rights dont mean shit, the fact that Im an American doesnt mean shit, when it damn well should. We are suppose to be free in this country, not at the will of Fascist Loyalist Assholes. Not to mention there was one single person of color that I dealt with, they were all white as can be, and its no fucking surprise. <br />

				Totally I know how you mean to be treated as a criminal instead of mentally ill. Somehow breaking a silly law trumps referral to psychiatric care....uhg, It&#039;s tough and frustrating at times, but playing into their narrative is only going to hurt the cause. Martin Luther King put it much more eloquently about how non violence is more powerful, ect. We have to be strong. We ARE strong, together

				Thanks for sharing your story, glad you made this post. You said they harassed you at work and in the hospital.&nbsp; Did they ever come to your house?&nbsp; If they came to your house *what* did they do to the house and the stuff in the house?&nbsp; Were local cops there too or just feds?&nbsp; Thanks!

				I really wanted to reply and say&quot;I know&nbsp; exactly- .... but it&#039;s so true that I get angry and disgusted , and then depressed by the whole matter. So much so, I become apathetic to the whole matter and dont wanna talk about it.<br />I&#039;ve been through something like 20 different raids, my family used to be deep in the Meth circles since the 70s and I grew up watching the kind of atrocities the cops commit and get away with&nbsp; and it&#039;s buisness like usual for them. there&#039;s some descent ones, but you got to wonder really how descent of people are they really when turning a blind eye is how those other cops react. ..........<br />but yea- I know what you mean.More I talk about it the more it pisses me off- so Ill shut up now.

				shitty indeed my friend. Too much time on their hands I guess. Anyhow it pisses me off to talk about it too because there seems to be no accountability in LE. None whatsoever. That alone is incredibly frustrating. <br />The downside to doing this is that I cant order off SR, surely ive said enough. I thought the risk was worth it and I apologize if I got carried away, Im non violent just fucking furious. I suppose I can get over this, Ive been through worse.I figure as long as I dont give them a reason , and keep my nose clean, Ill be just fine. Not involved in anything anymore. Its a fucking tragic cycle for us all. I know some of those cops care to a certain extent, but the statistics and facts what about those. Mostly minorities are suffering from the so called war on drugs. Its time this shit stopped.
