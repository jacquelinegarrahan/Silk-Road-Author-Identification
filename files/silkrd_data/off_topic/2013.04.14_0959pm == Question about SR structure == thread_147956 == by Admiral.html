				Hi boys and girls :)<br />as you can see I&#039;m a noob here.<br />When I registered here my intention was to sell and maybe by stuff like, ebooks, sotware, cc, paypal accounts, serials, cracks ... But all I see here is drugs drugs drugs. I don&#039;t do drugs so i&#039;m not interested, so&nbsp; my question is: can I do here anything but drugs?<br /><br />P.s. my first thread hehe ;)

				You can sell non-drug items as long as they aren&#039;t intended to harm others.&nbsp; That means you cannot sell credit card numbers, stolen identities, hacked paypal accounts, etc.

				Yes there are 27+ other categories of items sold here that are not drugs.<br />Most of them make enough money to get drugs and extra funds.

				Steal or Ingest, they are completely different.<br />freedom of choice is only used in one scenario to have equal profit in a transaction
