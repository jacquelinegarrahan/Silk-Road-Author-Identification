				So I am contemplating what I should ask my doctor for tomorrow. Let me give a bit of backstory first. I have been seeing her for a couple of years and she has been more than happy to prescribe me just about anything with the exception of opiates.<br /><br />She started me on adderall for ADD, then gave me ambien and valium for the side effects. After about six months she switched me to desoxyn but I still had to take clonidine for its effects on my blood pressure. We stuck with that for quite some time and switched the benzos from valium to ativan, to xanax. We switched to provigil instead of desoxyn and still have the xanax. I switched insurance companies and they became stricter about the provigil. Made me get a sleep study and now I have insurance paying for Nuvigil 250mg daily. I take about 100-125mg a day and hoard the rest. I really don&#039;t take the xanax but hoard that as well.<br /><br />So I have all of these drugs piling up which I will sell on the road some day, but nothing seems particularly exciting to me.<br /><br />I get fentanyl patches from my pain doc, and get percodans from my general practitioner for kidney stones. <br /><br />So I have an appointment and really nothing to ask for other than more xanax which I don&#039;t take. I have already hit my deductible on insurance so anything for the rest of the year has zero copy as long as it is covered.<br /><br />If you were in my situation what would you ask for? <br /><br />I am thinking perhaps clonazepam and lyrica but as long as I go she will write for pretty much whatever as long as it is on my insurance formulary and is not an opiate. Lame constraints I know.<br /><br />My idea of a good time is smoking the gel from my fent patches and pretty much everything else is boring. I don&#039;t take much of the others as I have to function at a high level for work.<br /><br />

				Get some expensive anti-psychotic drugs... something that most people can&#039;t afford without nice insurance (as much of America is without decent coverage)... my uncle had heart surgery recently... his wife has other medical concerns...<br /><br />Get a drug that may help someone get their life back together. Seroquel. Cymbalta. Anti-psychotics. Anti-seizure medications....<br /><br />1. Think about what sells<br />2. Target audience: do you want make $$? Or do you wanna help people find their path?<br />3. Think about yourself. It sounds like you might have a heavy medical bill in your old age... Tuck away that cash for a beautiful death... die happy... die without pain.

				I don&#039;t think I really want to spend time selling or having anti-psychotics in my electronic medical record. I am stashing money away in my health savings account for old age. <br /><br />I just want to have a good time either in addition to drugs I currently have or hoard some decent pills for another day.<br /><br />I am at a loss of what else to ask for. She has offered me boner pills which I passed on. My pain doc has tried giving me more xanax or valium in addition to the fentanyl patches, but I just ask him to uo the dosage instead. He offered medical cannabis but would not write for the dronabinol that would explain it in a piss test at work. Not worth it to me.<br /><br />So besides clonazepam and lyrica, I am at a loss of what else to ask for. I would go straight to Opana or dilaudid, but it would make no sense for her to write for those and she could get scrutinized for them. If there were anti-depressive qualities even off label she would do it, but I cannot think of any serious way of stretching that truth.<br /><br />Yes she is a keeper and I don&#039;t really have much need for her at the moment. I would like to maintain the relationship in the event that I change my mind or ever go back tot he other insurance that will cover provigil no problems and give three month fills of desoxyn (#375). Those would be worth selling but not much motivation knowing that after the ones I have left are gone wont be able to be replaced. <br /><br />The fentanyl is so strong that it makes most of the other opiates seem like nothing.<br /><br />I can&#039;t really say that I find life boring and depressing when not smoking fentanyl, but that is more or less the truth as I type this right now.

				This is a bit dirty, but if you can undercut the rx vendors on valium/xanax/viagra, I would imagine they would fly off the shelf. Just a bit of advice you MAY not be thinking of. All of these RX&#039;s that you have &quot;hoarded&quot; will eventually lose potency and be worth nothing. On another note, me and a friend took a 100mg F Patch, drained the gel into nasal spray bottle, mixed in a bit of water to get the gel to mix in with some heat..... Lets just say that we were walking and drooling all day!. Smoking it, I have never heard of. 8)
