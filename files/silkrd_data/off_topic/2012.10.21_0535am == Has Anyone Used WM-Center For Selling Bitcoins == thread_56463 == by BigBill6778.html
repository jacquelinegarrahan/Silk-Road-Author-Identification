				OK I have been looking for a secure place to sell my coins I live in Canada and have really only 2 choices.Anyways I was looking for Buy/Sell Bitcoins and came across this site they offer to use western union ( which isn&#039;t safe but you can find people to with draw for you if you give them enough money) I just like some info If anyone has used their service or had problems from them&nbsp; find attached their web address for possible usage if need be by vendors/buyers <br /><br />I noticed the good thing was they only take 3% so that would be a bonus to Vendors <br /><br />https://wm-center.com/index.html<br /><br />Thanks Guys

				Correct me if im wrong but you vend from Canada? Theirs a small company in Ottawa that mails cash for bitcoins you can also go to their small store in Ottawa to exchange your BC for cash in person.
