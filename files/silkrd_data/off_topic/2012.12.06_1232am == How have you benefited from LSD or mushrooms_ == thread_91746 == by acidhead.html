				I have taken LSD about 100 times in my life.<br /><br />I don&#039;t recommend LSD and other psychedelics to everyone, but I have obtained the following benefits:<br /><br />-&nbsp; What used to seem vague and mystical to me in religion, I can now understand with perfect clarity. In the past, when I read religious texts, whether in the Eastern or Western traditions, I couldn&#039;t make much sense of them. Words like &quot;Brahman&quot;, &quot;Tao&quot;, &quot;the kingdom of God&quot;, &quot;the divine ground of being&quot;, no matter how much I could understand them on a verbal level, still seemed vague and meaningless to me, because I did not understand them on an experiential level. Now they are full of meaning. I now understand religion, although I don&#039;t identify with any single religion. I don&#039;t think that a lot of atheists really understand the meaning of God at the mystical or esoteric level. They only understand the mythic-magical side of God, which is why they reject God. Of course I reject God too, in that sense. But there are higher levels of interpretations of God that I would never have imagined before I became an acid-head. *<br /><br />- The same applies to art. What used to seem vague and subjective to me in art is now full of meaning. I can now look at a painting by Van Gogh, for instance, and understand exactly what the painter is trying to express. In the past I just thought his paintings were pleasant to look at, but I never really understood them on a deeper level.<br /><br />- I now appreciate forms of art that I previously regarded as worthless, particularly modern art.&nbsp; I also appreciate forms of music that I didn&#039;t like before, such as Pink Floyd, Indian classical music, and Chinese classical music.<br /><br />- I no longer fear death.<br /><br />- I appreciate nature more than I did before. <br /><br />- I feel greater empathy for people and animals. I show more kindness to people. I spend more time with my family. I am more patient and tolerant of other people&#039;s shortcomings.<br /><br />- I started exercising on a daily basis. I used to be very out of shape. I am now in better shape than most people I know. I also eat healthier <br /><br />- I changed my entire lifestyle.&nbsp; I used to be a slob, my house used to be always a mess, now I am very clean and tidy. <br /><br />- I used to drink alcohol every day, now I hate the feeling of drunkenness and am disgusted by the taste of alcohol<br /><br />- I am no longer shy around people. I have more confidence.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care what people think about me any more.<br /><br />- I developed a sense of humour. I used to have a very humourless, boring and matter-of-fact personality.<br /><br />- I have become more aware of unconscious mental processes, prejudices, etc.<br /><br />- I have a better understanding of philosophy and science in general<br /><br />- I could continue to list the benefits, but basically LSD allowed me to re-program my mind to have a better overall personality<br /><br />Anyway, I am interested in knowing how other people have benefited from LSD or magic mushrooms.<br /><br /><br />*&nbsp; (If you haven&#039;t had a religious experience on acid, there is a kind of technique to evoking it, and you usually have to take a relatively large dose of acid, at least by today&#039;s standards -- probably something like 200 to 500 micrograms. If you think the experience of God is just an illusion brought about by the effect of the drug, well, you can access this state without taking any drugs. All LSD does is increase your awareness.)

				I have done LSD and other psychedelics around the name amount of time... I have experienced a good amount of the same things... I have a better sense of my spirituality... and better grasp on reality and purpose... I now look at things for what they are and not what former opinions based on ideas and opinions that I had picked up from others while learning as a child.. I have a better sense of work ethic and actually use my body and brain to the fullest potential... (I was always a lazy stoner in my teens) I am proud of who I am and except my flaws... I had many realizations that just were not getting though for me until I used psychedelics to get to them... (I have done most of the mainstream psychedelics lsd, shrooms, 2c family, dmt in all froms ext..but i have done lsd the most) For self improvement, LSD is a great drug... =) As are DMT and MDMA... I have seen dick face assholes cry because they see how much of dick face assholes they are...Though most of them resort back to being this way after a short time i think it is important for everyone to see themselves with their third eye =)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I did mushrooms and made my mom breakfast and had a full conversation with her and gave her many complements. I used to yell at my mom for annoying me, but ever since I&#039;ve been treating my mom very nicely. <br /><br />I LOVE U MOMMY! :)

				mushrooms allowed me to begin the healing process after suffering from a chronic illness for 10 years. since then my health has been gradually improving and i feel better than i have in years. as for lsd, it brings back that childlike sense of wonder i lost when i became an adult, and i feel like it will be an invaluable tool for realizing my full potential.

				Great thread, great experience. I&#039;m gonna expand this to all psychedelics<br /><br />I learned the place and purpose of drugs in my life.<br /><br />I&#039;ve evaluated and made changes in my daily lifestyle.<br /><br />I was able to bond with close friends in a more profound, revealing, and fundamental way than otherwise.<br /><br />I&#039;ve improved my critical faculties.<br /><br />I am more able to see gradations of truth between absolutes and understand the points of view of others.<br /><br />Helps cure my persistent headaches!<br /><br />Was assisted in creating works of art through bursts of spontaneous and uninhibited creativity.<br /><br />Came to better understand the nature of perception, which aside from being cool and useful in itself, happens to benefit me practically in my line of education.<br /><br />Psychedelics give you superpowers, like super hearing and mega analysis.

				I have taken LSD on probably about 288 occasions. Largely it has had a pretty neutral effect on my life, leaning towards positive. I experienced Ego death and it was quite beautiful but I don&#039;t think it was really life changing. I have gained some very deep introspection into my life , certainly aided by LSDs ability to cause me to vividly relive past experiences. I feel like it helped me to understand how minds work, and my own in particular. It has given me several experiences with God, someone who I never had had experiences with before but who I still do not believe exists, if that makes any sense. Perhaps it has helped me to fear death less , particularly from ego death experiences, but I am entirely unconvinced that I will really merge into eternity when I die (I strongly suspect that I will fade into oblivion, unfortunately. My biggest hope for eternal life was a cyclic universe, but unfortunately it appears that the universe will experience heat death.).&nbsp; I really have an appreciation for aesthetics that LSD may have increased, I certainly have obtained an understanding that things are far far more intricate and detailed than my sober mind allows me to perceive. I may have a new perspective on life from it, it is hard to say how much of who I am is from LSD and how much is just from myself growing up and changing separately of LSD. <br /><br />I can&#039;t really think of any ways that LSD has negatively impacted my life. Maybe time I spent tripping instead of working and doing productive things, 288 acid trips literally translates into almost a year of time spent high and incapable of doing significant work. <br /><br />I think I will probably continue using LSD until the day I die, at least once or twice a month, preferably four times a month and preferably not more than that. I have to admit that I sometimes take LSD hoping for a truly life changing positive experience, but LSD has not brought that to me and likely it never will. I view it as like going to an art gallery to appreciate aesthetics, except the art is nature and the LSD simply allows me to see it as such. It is like therapy in some sense, I am sure it has had a therapeutically beneficial effect on me. It is like a religious experience beyond a doubt, indeed it is a religious experience, but I am not a religious person and LSD has not convinced me away from logic anymore than Christians have, but it has certainly been far more agreeable and helpful to me :).

				My most profound experience with LSD was some that I got from a chemist in his mid 60&#039;s I would imagine, very polite, nice man whom I met from a friend of mine.<br /><br />He asked if I had ever taken any psychedlics before, and I have; he just warned me prior it&#039;s strong the ones he make.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure of the whole process of creating it, however, I received 5 hits from him of blotter sunshine acid, as he called it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not well versed with names when it comes to LSD however, I was in a dilemma.&nbsp; Should I take 3? I think I have a high tolerance; but if 3 doesn&#039;t effect me then the other two are wasted as I have no other friends other than my buddy who was taking all 5, so I did as Hunter S. Thompson would of done: I bought the ticket and I took the ride.<br /><br />First 30 minutes: Nothing to report<br />45 Minutes: Started to feel, werid. Not in a bad way.<br />1 Hour: I started yawning a lot, my eyes were watering a bit, a little anxiety came about (I have bad anxiety, take Xanax daily.) I took 3mg of Xanax to make sure I was going to have a pleasant trip.<br />1.5 Hours: I&#039;ve lost every ability to communicate with the outside world, my good friend whom I was tripping with put on the trippy looking Xbox music and we listened to a pre-selected Beethoven playlist.

(Nice guy of him, or perhaps he was enjoying it himself!)&nbsp; -- Jesus did I have to piss! So, I stumbly gain my balance for the first walk on this wonderful but initially disorientating drug and gathered my balance and composure a lot better than I had initially assumed, (mentally slightly paranoid about how I was acting).&nbsp; Natuarally, I had to look at my pupils, I love looking in the mirror, to see my, how I can I explain, &quot;artist rendention&quot; of my face and body.<br /><br />I sat and chatted with my friend for about an hour, it&#039;s now 3AM, I&#039;m wide awake, I decide what a lovely evening to drive.&nbsp; (In before the WTF)<br /><br />I end up driving some back roads with constant speeds of 45mph, set the cruise control on 45 and there&#039;s not a lot of life between me and my current destination and the drive was quite wonderful.&nbsp; I felt in complete control, if not more cautious than normal driving conditions.&nbsp; I did have Pink Floyd&#039;s dark side of the moon playing. (Favorite thing to listen to on any psychedelics),&nbsp; chilled at my buddies house who happened to be tripping as well! (Two female girls haha, that was halarious.. not to say all females are like this, they were just extremely &quot;goofy&quot;, I suppose they had a different trip than I, but nevertheless I stuck around a while, they smoked some weed, but I preferred where I was.&nbsp; I felt satiated, though ever so slightly thirsty, but again I didn&#039;t want this wonderful feeling to leave me, or somehow diminish the feeling I was having.<br /><br />6AM - WOW been there a long time, time to drive home, still working strong (bare in mind I took this at 10PM), drove on a dead highway at this time and day at 60MPH, the posted speed limit and again had cruise control on, as it felt time/speed was playing with me.&nbsp; So I didn&#039;t want to risk the chance of potentially getting pulled over for going to fast or more embarrassing to slow! LOL<br /><br />7:30AM - Arrived home.&nbsp; Dilemma, my parents are still home, I was residing with them for a short period of time while I was waiting for my apartment to be ready for me.<br />Option 1: Hang out in a parking lot for another 1.5 hours<br />Option 2: Go home, sneak inside quietly, however, they&#039;re up and they&#039;ll know I&#039;m home.<br /><br />Guess what I chose? Yep, Option 2.<br /><br />Greeted at the door by my father. &quot;Your pupils are rather large.&quot; -- &quot;Indeed they are.&quot;&nbsp; -- &quot;Don&#039;t let your step mom see them, gotta go to work, have fun today!&quot; With a huge grin on his face laughing.&nbsp; <br /><br />This was my experience, I know it was rather long, but it was also on the same token rather amusing.&nbsp; It&#039;s been 4 years since I have done LSD last, since my trip last 17 hours!<br /><br />End Result:<br />Awesome.&nbsp; Secondary benefits, I did not need to take my Xanax for my anxiety for nearly 2 weeks, though I did take very small doses 2mg next day, though I didn&#039;t feel I needed them.&nbsp; Following day 1mg, next .5, next .5, next .25, then 2 weeks straight after that none and I felt better than I have in my entire life!<br /><br />It&#039;s such a wonderful drug, especially for me with my anxiety and for whatever reason it actually curing it for to me a significant amount of time as I usually have full blown panic attacks with heart rates of 180+ and blood pressure 185/115 is the highest recorded, though I know I&#039;ve had worse symptoms, none though that have been recorded from a doctor or some machine that&#039;s around.<br /><br />Sorry for the long story, but it was worth every second of my time to write about it.&nbsp; I love you LSD. :)<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br />-Jimmy<br />

				I was at a point in life where everything was just going downhill - failing ass at my job, boss and coworkers getting seriously sick of me, failing study, health in the toilet (or so I thought) - and boy was I pining for some acid.<br /><br />So I finally got some... y&#039;know how it tends to cut the bullshit and let you figure things out? It did, I had a long hard think about life, the universe and everything, with a beautiful light show in in my eyes - and since then my attitude&#039;s improved, my health doesn&#039;t seem so bad, I figured out my problems and direction and I&#039;m back on track.<br /><br />Only thing I&#039;m worried about, though - does LSD have any long-term detrimental effect on your basic intelligence? ie. problem solving, lateral thinking? Mine seems to have suffered over time.. though it could just be chronic exhaustion.
