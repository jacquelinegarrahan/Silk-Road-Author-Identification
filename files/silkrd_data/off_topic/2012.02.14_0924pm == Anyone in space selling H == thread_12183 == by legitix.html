				Yes! why wouldnt that be allowed to be asked here? Of course there are people selling H on the moon... lots of em. I mean think of how many people live there, there has to be at least one dude selling some shitty dope somewhere. <br /><br />Its not not allowed its just not very smart. Youre on an anonymous site, even if someone was why would they tell you? If you want to buy some dope, go to the marketplace and there will be plenty of nice folks to take care of you with some really great H, worthy of starting to salivate over, just dont ask where theyre shipping from... or they wont be so willing anymore obviously.

				Yep it&#039;s easy as pie to find H on the moon .&nbsp; Just head down to the sea of tranquilityand stop at some shitty gas stations, liquor stores and make eye contact with the moonmen just hanging out.&nbsp; A lot of the time they will ask if &quot;you alright&quot; or something of the sort.&nbsp; Tell them you want some boy, blows, dog food, packs, lotto&#039;s, that is common slang down there.&nbsp; Never hand off money first always get the product cuz they are hustlers and will take you if you let them.&nbsp; If they don&#039;t have it they can usually get it.&nbsp; They may have you follow them a few blocks to&nbsp; a dope house but usually it&#039;s all good.<br /><br />If they are trying to sell crack avoid them like the plague.&nbsp; They are usually the junkies really trying to take you<br /><br />You can also head to the darkside of the moon, there is tons of dope in the shadow as well.&nbsp; Head to the east side or north end and do the same.&nbsp; Just look for the craters and hit gas stations or liquor stores.&nbsp; You aren&#039;t going to find open air but you will find a moonman that can help you.<br /><br />I have never tried to score on Jupiter, but I hear it is the same thing there, flooded with high quality dope.&nbsp; Hit the hoods and ask around.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK AND BE SAFE!

				If any seller was willing to let you you what state they are selling from avoid them (they&#039;re to dumb to breath, certainty to dumb to buy illegal things from).&nbsp; If I were a vendor I don&#039;t know that I would sell to you, questions like that make you seem skech, or to stupid to be buying illegal things online.
