				I´ve had a message from what I believe to be this guy. When I did the loan contract thread about 4 minutes later I had about 6 messages from different people asking for BTC. I gave the change I had left to the most deserving one and informed the others that I had nothing spare. <br />One message stood out because of their raping of the English language. <br /><br />The first was:<br />&quot;Can you spare.33BTC? I really need it. Please send me a message to let me know or just put on my SR account which is the same username as on here. Pay it forward!<br />Quote, &quot; i dont see asking for 0.2 coins or whatever as begging. it makes no sense to go to a bank and do the whole btcoin exchange process for 1 lousy dollar. you always have a small amount of coin left over after any purchase because a smart person buys a little more coin than they actually need so why not let someone have it if you dont need it? as long as you send it full circle then it is just helping someone out which i strongly encourage.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />When I apologized for not being able to help it was followed about 5 minutes later by an unintelligible insulting PM with much the same language as the OP quoted.. I don&#039;t know if the two messages are from the same poster or even related but it was strange.<br /><br />From the use of the language he is from the UK.. <br />Also I dont get the reference to shitwassocash, the dosent sell and she seems to nice to have people hating her.. <br /><br />ACE

				oh no, he&#039;s onto us, guys. :( better give him all our money.<br /><br /><br />lol, I can&#039;t speak retard, but using context clues I&#039;m able to discern that this piece of shit is angry with myself and those of us who either 1.)Called him out as a scammer/begger/general piece of shit or 2.) Believed or defended collapses over ivgotu<br /><br />I posted in one of his threads to defend collapses, because it&#039;s a shame a stand up vendor might lose business over this weasel&#039;s lies and threats. Somehow that translates to I&#039;m either working with or scheming with or having love babies with collapses.<br /><br />(If it matters, I defended the vendor based on my IRC friend&#039;s positive transactions with him. My friend is not on the forums, so I felt compelled to share that I know of legit transactions this vendor has made, where the customer has been nothing but happy with him.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh shit, you guys are right, I&#039;m an idiot for not putting two and two together. This is the same scumbag who keeps PMing me and others under different newbie accounts (very easy to tell it&#039;s him based on the writing) with various sob stories and begs for money.

				How can someone put so much effort into something and have it be so easily destroyed?&nbsp; Not cool.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well at least I still have my network of racketeering friends who have helped by making hundreds of orders and leaving perfect feedback for over a year and a half ALL JUST SO I could steal 200 pounds from some guy who can&#039;t speak English.
