				This knightmb who had 317,000 bitcoins!&nbsp; He was caught and charged for demanding a million dollars in bitcoins from Mitt Romney or he would release his private medical documents.&nbsp; Supposedly he never even had any documents to begin with.<br /><br />Knightmb supposedly donated most of his coins and made less than $200,000.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Michael Mancil Brown, who allegedly called himself &quot;Dr. Evil&quot; on the internet, has been charged with six counts of extortion and six counts of wire fraud for attempting to extract $1 million in Bitcoins from Mitt Romney. During the election season, an anonymous &quot;hacker&quot; claimed to have gotten hold of the presidential candidate&#039;s tax forms by sneaking into his accountant&#039;s office. The hacker threatened to release the private documents if Romney didn&#039;t pay up. It didn&#039;t work. There is no evidence that Brown actually possessed the documents, which were a major subject of scrutiny during the campaign; the government claims Brown made the whole thing up. The original ransom note, posted on Pastebin.com, is no longer available.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
