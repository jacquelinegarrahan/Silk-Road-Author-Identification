				Ok, so i have waited as long as i could before i took this to the forums, but i need your help.&nbsp; I recently placed an order with a vendor for some product that is hard to come by.&nbsp; I sent him a message the same day I ordered asking him how much extra it would be to upgrade to priority shipping.&nbsp; I sent that message 4 days ago and he has not read it and i know he has been online everyday since i sent the message.&nbsp; Since then i have sent 1 other message, so its not like I&#039;m flooding his inbox.<br /><br />I have been on here long enough to know that some people will say that i am being impatient and its really hard work being a vendor and replying to all messages.&nbsp; I agree that its difficult, but its also difficult to have a large sum of money tied up without any communication.&nbsp; What i would like to do is to cancel my order asap and order from somebody else so i can have some product by the weekend.&nbsp; Whats the best way to get the vendors attention without being rude or obnoxious?&nbsp; I would like to order from him in the future.&nbsp; Thanks guys

				If priority isn&#039;t an option to begin with, then chances are he doesn&#039;t offer priority shipping and your message is basically &quot;worthless&quot; (this is probably the case). If he does offer priority and you picked the wrong thing, since it has been 4 days, you can cancel the order and place it again with the correct shipping method.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

				I cant cancel for 2 more days.&nbsp; I sent him a message asking him to cancel my order now but it seems pointless.&nbsp; Anyother way i can get my funds back immediately?
