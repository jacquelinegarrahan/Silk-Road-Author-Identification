				If you stumbled across this thread, this thread is strictly for one purpose.<br />The talking of rabble/scrabble. I envisage that it will be most likely full of strung out meth addicts, who scradabble on about discussions about cryptic word strings that which other non tweaksters don&#039;t fully comprestand,<br /><br />If this made no sensicles to you, never fret, turn and walk away, knowing there are people behind doors talking about things that you will never know or understand.<br /><br />Discussions such as digging crystals out of the carpet when you spill the scoop, looking for, and finding shiny shards on the curb side, optimum techniques for transportation of the scoop from the package to the pip, what happens on the second and maybe third day, and so fourth.<br /><br />So...<br />

				I&#039;ve definitely tweaked for a week straight. The hallucinations i get, aren&#039;t so much mushroom distortion like hallucinations, they are more like, thinking i see a cat, where there was no cat, more a state of confusion. The problem is more that i just loose all my common sense. Loose my keys. Search everywhere for them. Checking the same place 5 times, neglecting to look in the obvious place. One big problem though is almost driving through red lights and such. Realizing the light is red at the very last minute, i swear it was green...or maybe i just never looked.<br />Swear that car next to me was a cop car. Nope, just a regular car.

How much shard do you usually go through in a week? And how do you not absolutely lose your shit?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I definitely used to loose my shit, which is why i stopped. A weeks binge back in the day when i was carefree, would take from half to 3 grams in a week, of good glass. <br />I find, after the second day up with no sleep, i&#039;m majorly discombobulated, minds blown and strung, it&#039;s no fun, just mind on replay, pacing around the house &#039;searching&#039; for things so i can go out, as if i&#039;m getting ready to do some task that i&#039;m not doing. The end task is sleep, is to stop binging, the peak never comes, and then i give up, keep smoking, resigned, in the loop anyway, stuck and brain fucked. You definitely become a different person in that 2nd / 3rd day, more in the moment, not give a fuck, just, loose and stupid, ignorant.<br />I think in the week long binges, i would sleep on average 2 or 3 hours a night, sometimes going to bed at 11, lie down for 2 hours, just waiting, get up, smoking at 2 or 3am mid week, not sure if i&#039;ll crash in the morning when work time comes, or whatever, just roll and charge anyway, it&#039;ll be all good.<br /><br />Fucking stupid attitude, but that&#039;s how it goes when you loose that control, it&#039;s the problem with glass, it&#039;s too powerful too easily. You gotta handle that shit well or not at all, it&#039;s no smoke a bong after work ready for the next day type shit, it&#039;s way too heavy for that, it fucks up all the patterns.<br /><br />So i stopped doin that, now days, hmm, i might smoke it once a month on a weekend, like a saturday. I&#039;ll wake up well early like 6am, do lots of cleaning and productive shit, big breakfast, then a moderate lunch about 11am. That way, i&#039;ve eaten and got food in my stomach early, and can smoke on around 1.00pm. If i don&#039;t do this, i either smoke on an empty stomach which is bad, or i smoke on a full stomach bloated which is shit and ruins it. You wanna be fed but not hungry and not too full, since i probably won&#039;t eat for atleast 6 hours after smoking.<br />And now, it&#039;s only the one smoke i get, gotta put it all away after that, no come backs, they are what ruins it. If i do it right, i&#039;m normally eatin a small dinner around 9 or 10, some beers and or bongs, and bed by about 1am. Not very tired, it&#039;s a forced sleep. It&#039;s more about getting a few hours sleep and maintaing the sleep routine. I usually wake up feeling fairly alright, and no huge hangover.<br />Once you&#039;ve stayed up all night, drugs or no drugs, you get a blank stare look on your face, your thoughts ae shit, i hate being caught in public with blank mullet face, and after a night binging it&#039;s bad for the reputation and inner feeling. I try and avoid all contact. I also find staying up to 7am then crashing out, not only fucks up the cycles, but leaves you wrecked the next day, it&#039;s crap, and i don&#039;t sleep well when the suns coming up so i&#039;m in zombie land.<br /><br />If i smoke after 3pm, either first time, or 2nd round after earlier in the day, im almost guaranteed to still be pinging at 6am, then your sleep patterns all fucked up and your in sleep debt.<br />I also find it&#039;s too easy to go past buzzing, and straight into fried and frazzled from too much, and unable to sleep, just, spun out. I try to avoid that, i like the small pickme up.<br />Also, when i used to do week long binges, when i would sleep for a few hours, i would take up, feeling as if i just hit the bed, like no time had passed. That was bad, because, you need time to distance yourself from the shit from the day before, the discussions, the arguments. If you come back the next day like it was moments ago, it&#039;s harder to move on from things, distance yourself from problems and arguments etc. That has a big impact, it means you keep going on about the same shit, which is why i believe addicts argue about the same things, no down time to get away from it, you go to bed with bad thoughts and pick them up where they left off.<br />Now days when i&#039;m sober, i wake up with new thoughts, the night before are somewhat distant, i like it that way.

				I heard IV ice and sex are phenomenal so I did .3g iv several days ago for the first time. I was alone, waiting for a friend to come over and join me in the usual play. I wasn&#039;t more than a couple minutes into the most incredible rush of my life when realized I just had to get my pants off and put something, anything, inside me. When my friend showed up, I didn&#039;t answer the door. What I was doing seemed way more important than the minute or two I might make my friend wait. It was over an hour later when I remembered the the door bell rang and it didn&#039;t even matter. Even though I was shaking, I managed to register and hit another .3, fuck! It was three days before stopped feeling sore down there and almost a week before I wanted to see or speak with anyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what I did to myself while I was rushing was kinkier than anything I&#039;ve ever read about and I would never share the details with anyone I knew personally. All I did was review that day trying to remember the things I did and put inside my body.<br /><br />Have you been to this sensational place? I&#039;ve never had anything feel so sexual before in my life. It felt like pure sensation and the world was way over there somewhere. Is more better? Let me know where you&#039;ve been, you know what I mean...<br />

				So, methology, tell us about what that was all about. Sounds like you were really compelled. Now I&#039;m curious, what could you have done that was kinkier than anything you ever read? Is this a true story? Are you male or female? I don&#039;t think more is better though, at least beyond a point. I hope you&#039;ll be careful with that. Remember in Indiana Jones when they opened the arc of the covenant? Those beautiful female spirits suddenly and quickly turned ugly and monstrous. Share with us if you&#039;re inclined. I think this is probably the right thread for these meth stories.

				endorfin, I am female and I appreciate your comments on &quot;Is more better?&quot; The Indiana Jones analogy is spot on but I am tempted to try a .5 IV next time. I weigh 106lbs so that&#039;s probably my limit. Thing is, I just don&#039;t get off. I never come during sex or even with a vib but with this, I just came and came and came, god!

				Sorry everyone, I was still pretty methed up when I posted those comments. Now I realize this could become, as one reader put it, a lurid porn story. I suppose if I had filmed myself I might have won a nomination but my intent was to exclaim my sudden drug fueled lust. It&#039;s true though, having never had an orgasm before, I was the benefactor of both a wild drug experience and the discovery of my own true carnal knowledge. It&#039;s taken me a while to digest all of this, as you can imagine, and I can&#039;t stop thinking about dissolving more shards to see if I can go back there, and there in-lies the problem with this drug.<br /><br />There is something about this drug that directs one&#039;s focus towards sex. While I was rushing, I was thinking about and imaging mostly torsos and genitalia the whole time, both female and male. It was frustrating because although I am fit and quite flexible, I can only get within about an inch of my kitty and I wanted so much to suck myself. Listen, all of you, please treat this professionally. I am really trying to understand this myself, and sharing it with you on the forum helps me articulate my thoughts. I have always been hetero, and this is the first time I have found the female anatomy sexually stimulating. Now that I am not high I find the thought of mouth to kitty disgusting. How does that work? I think I now understand what men mean when they say &quot;It was just sex!&quot;&nbsp; Sorry guys, I’ll never give you any shit for that one again.<br /><br />I&#039;ll get back to you later.

				Interesting posts there..<br />If you&#039;ve never really been into sex, i would go with MDMA + Marijuanna.<br />Without a doubt the sex combo.<br /><br />Meth makes you a sex fiend, but in my view, it gives you body energy, and leaves you all messed up, but doesn&#039;t seem to do much for the soul aspect. I think people get too caught up focusing on having long big sex. I would rather Good enjoyable sex - Big difference.<br /><br />Weed though, it relaxes your muscles and puts you more in touch with your body.<br />And MDMA is in my view a multiplier. So multiply the effects of mrijuanna.<br />Weed and meth, just makes you all sideways.<br />Where as weed and mdma, will make you into a melting furball, rubbing the couch for the amazing soft feeling.<br />Try 80mg of mdma with some weed, then another 50mg of mdma with more weed. Mind blowing. <br />As much as i love my meth, i honestly believe it&#039;s got virtually fuckall to offer, i&#039;m just helplessly addicted and love the act of smoking it, but do i actually think i get anything out of it, hell nah. It doesn&#039;t really make me feel floaty or in touch with the universe like mdma and weed does. If anything it actually kills that shit off.<br />Meth would be my choice drug in some sort of apocalypse / war scenario.<br />The other super powerful sex drug would be weed + NBOME. But weed and mdma is my choice, best to try with tiny amounts like 30mg if you&#039;ve never done mdma though to learn about how it works.

				Zerd thank you for your input on MDMA and weed. You’ll be happy to know I do have lots of warm, fuzzy, emotionally close relations. My problem is I never achieve orgasm. I get real close and then it just fades. That happens during intercourse and when I play solo with my toys. I have done MDMA and had sex. We were already high on weed. It was wonderful but I still stalled just short of an orgasm. I love sex and have always been resentful about not being able to really get off good. I’m in my mid twenties and all through high school and college my friends would talk about their earth shaking orgasms. A couple of them could get off real easy, really pissed me off. I sort of knew what it was going to feel like because of what the buildup felt like, but I wanted it way stronger. <br /><br />When I posted my IV meth experience I was not only elated by that fabulous rush but also that I had just experienced my first full body orgasm. And to top that off, I just kept having them while I was rushing really hard. I was almost getting off from the meth. That’s why I just had to get my pants off and touch myself. All it took was a finger on my button with the hood pulled way back, and it all got so fucking intense.&nbsp; I also did some other really kinky things that I’m sure the meth had a whole lot to do with. God that was fun! Looking back, I just can’t believe I did that stuff, and how really good it felt.<br />

				Hey methology, if I could give karma I would. You deserve it for sharing your experience with the SR community. Not many females are sufficiently comfortable with their sexuality to open up like this, kudos. Please, just be careful and please, if you will read this excellent forum post by candorean:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=22378.0<br /><br />Yes, it reads a bit like a porn story but, what you are expressing has much substance and could be very beneficial to others on this forum, male and female.<br />

When I first started reading your story my eyes began to glaze over and I just about skipped it thinking you were a guy trying to share your first meth fueled masturbatory and gay sex experience. Plus, I had a hard time imagining a girl calling herself &quot;methology&quot;. So the way you spoke of your &quot;friend&quot; coming over and inserting things in yourself had me feeling kind of ill. <br /><br />So let me guess, you chose that nick AFTER having this out of world orgasmic experience? :) <br /><br />As far as meth fueled sex, yeah it&#039;s intense. Especially when you find someone willing to go the distance with you. It&#039;s even more crazy when you mainline and go the distance, as you&#039;ve kind of discovered. ;) <br /><br />So check this out. The ultimate designer sex drug that is supposed to be particularly effective for women but is suppose to work real well for both sexes is this stuff called PT-141 aka Bremelanotide. It never got approved by the FDA because a nasal spray that was in development was found to have a side effect of raising blood pressure in 2% of test subjects. BUT, if you muscle it, there are no known side effects and is supposed to be far more effective. The best part is that it seems like a vendor JUST began offering preloaded syringes on SR:<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/508293dbfd <br /><br />It was being hailed as the &quot;viagra for women&quot; when first discovered about 6 years ago and could do the trick as an alternative to helping you get off. Or just think of the possibilities if used as a COMPLIMENT to meth even!&nbsp; 8)

				Depends on my circumstances. If I want a little, I&#039;ll eat it. If I want a good buzz, I&#039;ll smoke. If I want an E ticket ride, I&#039;ll IV. How about you Gary?

I&#039;ve never heard of it associated with VCR cleaner fluid and the recent SR listing is the first time I&#039;ve seen it offered anywhere. It was originally tested as a sunless tanning agent and because the nasal spray increased blood pressure for a tiny amount of test subjects they&#039;re testing an IM version that doesn&#039;t. There&#039;s been lots of hype over it the last six years so it&#039;s been a letdown the FDA keeps rejecting it.&nbsp; Didn&#039;t even know there&#039;s a cleaning fluid that does anything like that.
