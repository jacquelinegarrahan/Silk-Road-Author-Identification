				Hello every one, i will try and make this brief . Im currently having tech difficulties with my accounts funds and Bitinstant. I am affraid im going to miss the listings i have been waiting for and my account is short of what i need to place a minimal order. If anyone would be willing to donate any amount of BTC it would be a miracle. <br />&nbsp;I have lots of goodies i can and will kindly send to who those who donate.. your donation amount will reflect the amount of what ever it is you request i send. <br />&nbsp;I currently have on hand a few feminized, grade A marijuana seeds, strains as follows; (1)SourCream,(1)Chronic,(1)SourKush &amp; (2)TrainWreck&nbsp; . Also I can offer .25mg xanax pills (peach footballs). As well as amazing buds, Some Sour Diesel ,BlueDream, and some less potent lower grade hydro that im sure no one will be interested in lol.<br />&nbsp;My shipping methods are absolutely stealth and discreet. Esp with the actual bud, no odor will be present.<br />please PM me for details. PGP keys an absolute must! <br />&nbsp; thankyou everyone for your time.

				1) You don&#039;t mention a time frame for paying back<br />2) You don&#039;t mention paying back<br />3) People would have to give up their addresses.<br />4) You don&#039;t supply a PGP key to encrypt stuff for anyone that would be bonkers enough to go for this.<br /><br />-Tunbear

				Well after pointing it out to me i was going to post my pgp key, but youve set the bar here. You didnt have to give me -Karma for being concerned about my money, asking for help and offering to do the right thing by whom ever may have helped to the best of my means. Youve been loads of help MrTunbear. thanks again.

				I never gave you negative karma, you&#039;re not a vendor so your karma score is more a number to see how many people like your replies and not a reflection on your service, therefore I don&#039;t bother with it.

				YupYupYup, sorry again to any one that was bothered by this, lol. i cant always explain my thought process . My coin issue has been resolved by bitinstant. I certainly didnt mean to carry out any prohibited sales through the forums, just thought it would have been kind to offer something to some one willing to help. I didnt realize it was such a big problem, well we learn from our mistakes dont we. sorry again every one!
