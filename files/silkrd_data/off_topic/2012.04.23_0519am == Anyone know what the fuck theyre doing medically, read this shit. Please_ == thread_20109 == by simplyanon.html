				Chest pains (Mostly dull, some very sharp.) Very high pain tolerance, and this shit HURTS when it gets sharp. It&#039;s mostly just a dull ache though.<br /><br />Pain, mid spine, sharp and inconsistent. <br /><br />Teeth and jaw feel funny, kinda a buzzy feel.<br /><br />Same as teeth just behind left ear. <br /><br />Breathing heavy, almost feels like A panic attack but It&#039;s not.<br /><br />A few mid sized cups of 1/3 vodka and orange juice in the system<br /><br />Google fails me, fuck hospitals..no insurance (Thank you, uncle sam, you jackass). No vehicle right now, anyways. Fucking timing chain decided to off itself. <br /><br />Got anything for me or just ride this shit out and switch to icewater.<br /><br />Right fingers are hurting now, and a slight headache.<br /><br />What in the serious fuck.

				Aspirin been chewed and I&#039;m on my 3rd bottle of water. It&#039;s really weird. Sometimes everything will just stop, and I&#039;ll feel fucking great. Like, chills everywhere, stepped into a house thats had the air conditioning on all day and its hot as fuck outside kinda feel, then it goes back to this bullshit.<br /><br />My luck (or lack there of) I&#039;ll end up having a heart attack or something. -___-<br /><br /><br />&quot;Error: The last post from your ip was less than 0 seconds ago&quot;<br /><br />Well no shit, sherlock.

				Those bone pains are weird as fuck.<br />Heavy breathing.. Maybe the alcohol.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too knowledgeable in this area, but those symptoms are hell weird.<br />Come back to this thread tomorrow?<br />When all of the drugs have worn off.<br /><br />Thank god Australia&#039;s medical system is pretty good, like being in USA with expensive medical system is my worst nightmare.

				Sounds like what happened to me a few months ago. I didn&#039;t go to the hospital or anything, and it eventually went away, but I swore I had angina.<br /><br />Don&#039;t google it though, or you&#039;ll probably be convinced you have it, too. Chest pain can mean so many different things, it&#039;s a really tough call.

				I won&#039;t google, thanks for the heads up, miss. Seeing as that&#039;s usually the first thing I do.<br /><br />The chest is now just uncomfortable. Not painful, but not normal. The back kinda aches, so I&#039;ma try and crack it in a sec. Fingers are good, elbow, of all things, sorta burns. And I&#039;m getting random muscle spasms in my face. Eyebrow twitches, jaw clenches, etc. Teeth still kind feel tingly too.<br /><br />Aw well, now that my heart doesn&#039;t feel like its going to implode, waaiiiit, no, okay, felt like it was coming back for a second. Anywho, I guess if my chest wont ex/implode I&#039;m not TOO worried about it. <br /><br />Thanks for the replies guys and gals, &lt;3 (nohomo) I wasn&#039;t really hoping for much more than a &quot;Shut up, see a doctor.&quot;

				What drugs have you been consuming over the past 24 hours? <br /><br />What&#039;s your consumption like for the last 2 weeks?<br /><br />Honestly, hospital brother, if you&#039;re not feeling much better..

				Ever had back problems? This could very well be some tissue/muscle inflammation (or whatever the correct English term is). Hurts like shit, might look like a heart attack, but actually is not dangerous. (In fact, most emergencies that look like heart attacks are in fact of this kind. Also, back problems can explain a number of muscle twitches, especially in extremities.)<br /><br />But I fear that only an ECG can really exclude heart problems.<br /><br />(On the other hand, if this really is muscle inflammation, some Tetrazepam works like charm ;-) )

				Have you ever seen the movie Aliens?<br /><br />You might want to freeze yourself in cryogenic chamber and get yourself to the nearest medical ship for a chest scan.<br /><br />On a side note you could try floating in a warm pool or bath tub to relieve any pressure on your back and chest.
