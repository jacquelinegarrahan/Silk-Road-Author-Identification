				Don&#039;t use opiates and in-organic drugs.<br /><br />MDMA is one of the cheapest drugs you can buy here, but you don&#039;t do it everyday.<br /><br />A good diet makes a world of difference.<br /><br />

				Pt-141 has a lot of popular reviews other places if you are going the chemical route. Otherwise, try to get lots of sleep, good diet and exercise. Another possibility is eliminating what may be causing it in the first place such as ssri&#039;s, night shift jobs, etc.

				Honestly, just don&#039;t do any drugs for a while. Eat healthy and do some sport.<br /><br />Drugs like opioids will ruin your sex drive.<br />I also made similiar experience after taking stimulants for a longer while and then stopping.<br /><br />Takes my body about a couple of weeks to even itself out. ::)

				If you brew up a cocktail of two parts viagra to one part cialis to three parts ecstasy in a pot of hot green tea and of course give it a swirl around with some blood of the menstruation from your misses this is known to take your sex drive back to where it was at least five years prior, or so I am told.

				Eat healthy &amp; do lots of exercise.<br />Taking drugs daily is not going to help anything. At least not in the long run.<br /><br />Methamphetamine makes most people extremely horny, but only use it occassionally.<br />And there is no way you can do MDMA every day. After 3 or 4 days the high will be shit and the side effects will be terrible.<br />MDMA is an occassional drug.<br />

				Don&#039;t worry man , never last forever , i can suggest you as other peoples said do a good diet , some sport regularly and you will see changes in 2 months , anyway using drugs if you have some problems can make them worst , and remember that most of the time problems are only in your head , expecially in sexual life. Take care.
