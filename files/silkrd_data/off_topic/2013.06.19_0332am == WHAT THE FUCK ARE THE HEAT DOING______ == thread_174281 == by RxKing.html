				It is now a fact....even if they come back to win this game...Lebron James is fucking TERRIBLE!!!!<br /><br />I would bet a shit load of money money that his lack of confidence comes from the fact he has a small dick! there is no other explanation.I am dead serious..<br /><br />This guy is 28(meaning in his absolute PRIME)....6&#039;8.....250.....runs a 4.4 40...can jump 48 inches off the ground..in some regular season games that do not mean shit...he can look unreal....but when it counts...and he needs to come up big...HE FUCKING SHITS THE BED! He just looks fucking lost...<br /><br />When Mj played...and the bulls needed two points...and his jumper was off( so fucking rare)....he would go to the hole...and either get fouled and make BOTH free throws... or&nbsp; he would dunk...or he would make some unreal layup.....this fucking Lebron does NONE OF THAT!<br /><br />The only thing he is GREAT at...and maybe the best ever....is the come from behind defender on a fast break...meaning running someone down and defending the rim....and it just so happens that the second best at it...especially for his size at 6&#039;4 is Wade. They are both truly great at that...but Lebron James is truly the most over rated player in the history on the NBA!<br /><br />There is NO WAY the bulls and MJ would be down 12 points at home in a game 6...and Mj would take 4 shots in a row..miss them all...then come down...and throw a pass away....then come down on defense and out of frustration...try and make a spectacular defensive play and instead foul the guy and give him and and 1....not once....but twice! And as I am writing this I just watched that happen!!!<br /><br />If Wade was 100% healthy...he is better then lebron. Dont mistake what I am saying...Lebron James is a fantastic player...compared to the rest of the league.....and guys like Smoosh Parker......but if you try and compare him to kobe,Mj,magic,Bird......they would ALL.... in there prime...make him look like he is..a very good NBA player...but not a legend.<br /><br />Could you imagine what the Bad boys of Detroit would do to them? The showtime lakers of 87? The 85 celtics? The 2013 Sprurs!!!!!What would the Worm would do on deference to him? he might not score! What Pippen and Jordan would do against wade and Lebron? OMG. KuKoc would light up Bosh. Pippen and Rodman would double Lebron he would have to pass to wade...where is mike didnt steal it...he would just lock him up....Mj would make Wade look like Reggie Theus...Steve kerr and John Paxon would make wide open threes like Lay ups....I would say the 96 bull team would be 13 point favorites at home...and 5 points in Miami!<br /><br />In fact... I believe the bulls teams...any of the 6....would sweep the Heat!&nbsp; <br /><br />When the Bulls went on the road to play a game where it was to win the series and they had 2 games there...like game 4 and 5......MJ would pack just 1 suit!!! As there was no need for 2....he was only going to be in town for 1 game!<br /><br />That&#039;s a fact. And that&#039;s a baller. A hall of fame baller. None of these pussies now have that confidence...they may talk like they do...but they play like shit. Go on you tube and watch Jordan&#039;s worst game......it was 20 points...3 rebounds 3 assist.... HIS WORST GAME! And his team WON!<br /><br />Do your self a favor and put in larry bird vs the Atlanta hawks in youtube... he makes like 17 in a row or something insane...the ATLANTA bench is going nuts...and bird is talking shit on each shot...<br /><br />I am done ranting...and the heat are down 3 with 7:35......time to sweat this game. Please GOD(mj) let the heat pull this off!

				Obviously I am a HUGE MJ fan...But I happen to be a HUGE basketball fan or I should say WAS...and from 83 on Christmas day when I was very young I remember watching the 76ers and Dr.J ...I realize I am aging myself...but I do not care..its no big deal...but the year I became a super fan was 87 when the Lakers beat the Pistons...though I remember 86 and the Celtics winning... But in 1988 I fell in love...I learned about Michael Jordan...and for the next ten years...I did not miss a game he played. I watched every single NBA game I could. And this was in the days of only games on WGN and TBS and then CBS on weekends......and then the local team. the fact is we did have cable...but back then the only way to get even a glimpse of what we have now...is if you had a big satellite...but we did not.<br /><br />If I was getting a blow job and the bulls were playing....I would tell her to move her head so I could see the game. I didn&#039;t turn down the bj...I was not gay! Just a nerd with the NBA<br /><br />But Luckily the guys that ran cable back then....realized Mj was the next muhamed ali...and basically all his games were on tv in his career.... I could not even imagine what I would do back then for NBA TV and league pass.&nbsp; All I can say is with that and the DVR I would have&nbsp; watch every single game...even Milwaukee vs Charlotte.&nbsp; And I would have loved it...and back then I had not 1 dime on a game until the last 2 years of the 10 years I spent watching the NBA. Now I could not watch 1 game with out a bet on it. I watch ESPN...I watch lakers...of course the Heat....but to watch a game like the Wizards vs the Blazers...is because I have a bog bet on it...and though both teams have some sick players....the fact is I am not a super fan anymore.<br /><br />But from 87 to 97...I new every player...and every team...every head coach...every trade...and all this was pre internet..though in 95 there was AOL..the fact is...in that whole time I never used the internet. But I would go to the local Library...and on microfiche(http://www.ehow.com/about_4615977_what-is-microfiche.html I would read the Dallas Morning star so I could read about the Dallas Mavericks and in fact I would read the home newspaper of every team in the NBA...yes I was that big a nerd. And not that I did that every day...but I would do it like 2 times a month...and I would read USA today and pro sports illustrated and sports illustrated and every other magazine I would rip off from my local grocery store. I would estimate that I stole at least 15 magazines a week for over&nbsp; 5 years. Also in 87 we first got TBS and I fell in love again... With Ric Flair bit that is a whole other post. Whooooooooooooo!<br /><br />But I would love to talk NBA or any sport but Hockey......even baseball is a little slow..and with out a bet I do not know how 1 person could watch Kansas city vs Seattle if you didn&#039;t have a family member on the team.<br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />So the HEAT just won!!! YES!!!!! And Lebron will get credit as he hit that 3...but the fact is...they should have been up 8 if he was any good. And in his interview he is saying he sucked...but they won..so at least he is honest. Thank GOD for RAY!! That fucker can shoot from the corner like it is a lay up.

				I have just gone through the most emotional rollercoaster over the last hour that there are no words for it. I have so much adrenaline still pumping through my system that my hands are still shaking and my legs feel like jelly. Holy titty fucking christ, that was one helluva game. GAME 7 BABY AWWWW YEAAAAH!!! ITS OVER NOW!! <br /><br />The HEAT is on.

				And yeah I agree Lebron made some critical mistakes at the end of the game. But at the end of the day we won and like you said he realized and admitted his mistakes. He also did have that clutch 3 (after a terrible miss). To be honest, HEAT got lucky. But at the same time SA going up by 5 all of a sudden at the end of the game was kind of lucky too. Like I said this game was a fucking emotional rollercoaster. There was a moment I almost cried when I thought the season was ending, but I didn&#039;t because I&#039;m not a girl (and also if I admit that RxKing would never let me live it down). <br /><br />All in all, good fucking game. Terribly officiated, but still a good game. I&#039;m so glad its going to be decided in game 7.

He made some crucial errors with the headband on too... it wasn&#039;t that lucky. Besides, Lebron is not superstitious.

But I agree with you on the roller coaster...I am still on it...cant believe we won! And cant believe how we finished off the 2nd quarter...and were down so much at half...and are lucky as shit they chocked...<br /><br />All I can remember is his dribbling then going to the hole and him throwing it away...him on the fast break where yes he maybe got fouled...BUT he also lost the ball out of bounds... And how he was guarding Parker...when we were up 3...and he fakes him out and LBJ go&#039;s for it and Parker steps back and nylons a 3! I mean he has help behind him...we are up 3....DO NOT LET HIM TAKE A 3...he is 6&#039;2...what did LBJ do???? LET HIM TAKE A THREE AND NET IT!!!! That is the shit I remember...yes he hit that 3.....well shit...he was 0 for like 7 in the 180 seconds before that with 2 airballs...I think you are to young heatfan to remember Jrodan..and I can not even believe I am this fucking old that I just said that!!! But I can tell you...MJ...NEVER MISSED in the 4th quater..<br /><br />The play after he did the dribble between the leggs then lost it...the very next play...he airballs. it...and tuens it over again!...I know he hit that three...but truth is...if he did what say....Kobe would have...or lets just go there...what MJ would have....we would have been up 8.<br /><br />RAY SAVED OUR ASSES...yes We needed that lebron 3.....but the sequence of the lbj Miss 3....and then the rebound and kick out to ray...was unreal...and it is unreal how good he is in those corners...And it was crazy with 1 min we were up 3 with the ball and LBJ turns it over and next think I know we are down 5 with 30 seconds!<br /><br />I know it sounds like I am joking about the small dick thing....but I am serious...i get a gaydar on him...and since I do not beleive he is gay...I think he has a small dick....and every one...guys and girls...can tell the guy who has the small dick...and LBJ acts like they do...he has ZERO CONFIDENCE....<br /><br />There was a point mud season..in the streak..where he could score at will...I mean he was shooting like 60%...and was having games like 11 of 17 12 rebounds and 8 assist and 4 steals...and not only could he not miss any jumper...he could go to the whole and Finnish..something he was not good at before....and if you are not jaded and you want the game again...and focus on him...he has NO CONFIDENCE!!! NONE...and because we compare him to the hall of famers.. he just clearly does not Finnish... I do not know how many of you watch Lakers games...but if you did...you would see where Kobe has that killer instinct...as close to MJ as anyone...and he just takes over and dominates...and does not miss in the 4th quarter...and LBJ just doe snot have that.... And I am a HUGE heat fan...way before the big 3...if any thing since the big 3 I have fell off the wagon....I love WADES game...and a healthy wade has that Jordan/Kobe like ability...and he showed it when he won his championship with shack.....Lebron is just so physically dominating..that he gets those numbers...but on the 4th quarter...he shit the bed...and I do LOVE he admitted so...but I also love..and tall that matters....WE WON! Game 7 is on..<br /><br />

				There would be no game 7 if it weren&#039;t for Ray Allen&#039;s clutch 3 and Kawhi/Manu missing free throws. Still one of the most exciting nba games I&#039;ve seen in a long time. Can&#039;t wait for game 7!
