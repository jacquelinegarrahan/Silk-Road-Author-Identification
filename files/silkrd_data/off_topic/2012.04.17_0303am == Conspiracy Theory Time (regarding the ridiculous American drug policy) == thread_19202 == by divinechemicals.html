				So I&#039;m not usually a conspiracy theorist, but I&#039;ll be damned if the American drug policy makes even a lick of fucking sense. So sometimes I get to thinking, and this is what I come up with.<br /><br />Why are some drugs illegal? Let&#039;s examine. To start, we have to recognize that cigarettes and alcohol, two very dangerous drugs, are both legal in the United States. But there&#039;s an interesting connection to both, not just the health dangers. See, on cigarettes and alcohol, the user doesn&#039;t think more. His mind isn&#039;t opened, it is in fact closed. You are able to function less, and although you may be personally happier, your mental capacities are lessened.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s look at drugs like MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, and even weed. On each of these drugs, the user is inspired to think more. In fact, he tends to love his fellow man a little bit more on each of these drugs. The user begins to think and realize that a lot of what the government does is bullshit, and that a lot of what society thinks is wrong. Well shit, the government can&#039;t have everyone loving each other. They need us to fear and hate each other, because fear and hate means we&#039;re not focusing on the real enemy: the people running the whole show. <br /><br />They&#039;re happy to let us smoke nicotine and drink alcohol because it keeps us sated without allowing us to grow wiser. But the minute we take a mind-expanding drug, they get scared. These drugs make people want change, and the people in power don&#039;t like change. They like things just the way they are because they&#039;re the ones in power. They spread lies and misinformation about illegal drugs to make the population fear them and demonize the users. They put harsh punishments on the sale and consumption to detract people from using them.<br /><br />In doing this, they have maintained their power, and ensure that the people will not figure them and their schemes out.<br /><br />Welcome to America, land of the fuck-ups and home of the bullshit. <br /><br />Thoughts? Am I just crazy?

				You are not crazy but I think the conspiracy is one to make money more so than to prevent mind expansion, although that probably does also play a role. Government makes people afraid of drugs, make drugs illegal, get more money from people to fight the war on drugs, make more money for their powerful lobbyists interests. It really is a conspiracy, and all of the people who participate in it should be charged with conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity, and given death sentences.

				This is about right.<br /><br />There are also mega-powerful lobbyists for both the alcohol and tobacco industries, and fat corporations who can bury you in money to make sure their drugs of choice stay on the shelves and in the bodies of the masses.<br /><br />As far as the effects: alcohol actually shuts down parts of the brain and is known as the drug of choice of the upper classes- thousand dollar bottles of champagne and scotch, bottle service, etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cigarettes are rooted in the colonial economies of tobacco plantations and slavery, they are as American as apple pie and a product of New World cultivation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Psychedelics and pot are associated with the counterculture and dissident thought.&nbsp; They challenge the status quo, and in the case of weed, are typical of the lower, brown people classes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The funny part is the hippie movement wouldn&#039;t have taken off like it had if Ken Kesey hadn&#039;t been dosed with LSD as a part of CIA MKUltra experiments.&nbsp; Luckily, Ken was one of the few whose brain wasn&#039;t fried in the government&#039;s sick tests (often on unwitting people or mental patients), and he saw LSD as a key to new perceptions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cigarettes and alcohol have backers who are MUCH more powerful than the peaceful and experienced backers of psychedelics, so these evils remain the mainstay while safer mind-expanding drugs are outlawed and feared by the ignorant masses spoonfed propaganda and scare tactics.<br /><br />How can a capitalist world persist when people realize consumerism is bullshit and there is more to life than constantly accumulating unnecessary bullshit and obeying the masters?

				Fuck I love this community. It&#039;s the only one I know (aside from Shroomery I suppose) where a bunch of people can come together and say that we know the truth about drugs. We know that we can be responsible with them and that ultimately it is our choice. I&#039;m sick of the government infringing on our rights like this. It&#039;s complete and utter bullshit. Every time I do psychedelics, I am in a better place. And I don&#039;t mean I&#039;m in a better place like I want to leave the real world or jump off a building. No, I just see the world for what it is. I see humanity as something that could be great if people felt love for each other instead of hatred. And these drugs are what make you feel that love more than ever before. They unlock the part of the human brain that contains empathy. They&#039;re the fucking key to peace! And the government takes the key and throws it away, and everyone that tries to get it is locked away too. <br /><br />That&#039;s a really cool comic you posted there Jaurk. Time and time again the drug policy has been reexamined, and each time people just shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;We can&#039;t change it now. This is how it&#039;s been.&quot; There&#039;s no more logical arguments being made, it&#039;s just people thinking that capital D Drugs are bad no matter what. Heroin and marijuana are put in the same fucking league, as if they&#039;re even remotely related. It&#039;s all one giant scare machine meant to confuse the general population and pit us apart. Every psychedelic user I know loves people more than the average person, and they understand things better. This is exactly what the government doesn&#039;t want. Thank goodness sites like the Silk Road are allowing us to spread the knowledge that comes with moderate drug use. How dare anyone try to hide these experiences from people.

				Alcohol and tobacco and certain prescription drugs are legal because you have massive corporations lobbying to keep them legal. <br /><br />A lot of harmless drugs are illegal because some people make A LOT of money running your private prisons and they lobby to keep them illegal. They also want harsher sentences for possession. Don&#039;t forget that some people feed their family and furnish their second home by putting you in jail for a victimless crime.<br /><br />Also, some &quot;mind-expanding&quot; drugs make you likely to renounce consumerism and start focusing on your family and interpersonal relationships and learning about the universe around you, instead of working longer hours for less pay so you can buy the new iPad. I&#039;m not a conspiracy theorist, by any means, but I&#039;m 99% sure there&#039;s a secret government document out there that says &quot;drug users are bad for the economy&quot;.<br /><br />This is just one of the many reasons that the corporate first-world terrifies me. I&#039;m in the UK but we&#039;re not too far behind you Americans. It&#039;s very scary to be alive and poor just now.

				Originally drugs were made illegal as way of passing racist legislation. Marijuana was widely enjoyed by Mexicans and when it was banned by congress they said it encouraged Mexicans to rape white women and made vulnerable young white people psychotic. Then the police could arrest Mexicans because they were smoking weed anyways. The opium wars were meant to suppress Asians. Heroin was kept legal for an extra twenty years because everyone liked it so much but basically the Opium acts allowed police to deport Chinese people for drug offenses and at the same time the Chinese exclusion act forbid them from immigrating, so the drug laws were a way to steadily decline the Chinese population. They claimed that opium lead young white women into a life of prostitution and drug dependance in Opium dens and that it made young white men impotent and incapable of working or having families. They also stated that with habitual use opium emaciated white features so that addicts started to look more and more like Asian people. <br /><br />Now drug laws feed the prison industrial complex and allow police to self fund through asset forfeiture, and the motivation to endorse the laws and crack down harder and harder comes from people who really don&#039;t know anything about drugs and have genuine moral convictions that they are evil because its such an established notion in the collective consciousness.

				&nbsp;xtx lsd and mushrooms dont able you&nbsp; function more then alcohol and ciggs...be reasonable here lol<br /><br />and alchol and ciggs are less human consumptive but who is to say what we can and cant do with our bodies? not the government <br />if the government want to intervene with our bodies they should put texas on a diet. <br /><br />if the government wants to be winning the war on drugs (75 percent of it) they should legalize weed...instead we are losing the war on drugs ( 25 percent).. so what a big turn around this would be<br /><br />why doesnt the government make more state funded anti drug programs for kids and rehabs? they rely on churches and the public to fix/ suffer from this when they are causing it..<br /><br />be brave enough to say i don t want drugs not some government telling you<br /><br />now about weed...i dont smoke it but i have been a member of norml and an activist for must of my life..why? well i loved weed for a lot of years&nbsp; so the question is why am i still participating in it?<br /><br />the reason is we need to pull the plug be making it illegal we are supporting all the cartels and drug dealers...i get it, America isnt quitters! well we need to throw in the towel and we will within the decade when rich cartels decide they want to take over the boarder (ok a little much) but alcohol prohibition hasn&#039;t failed anywhere NEAR marijuana prohibition? WHAT THE FUCK IS REALLY UP???? the smartest societys/ people in the world KNOW everything happens for a reason and that reason usually is financial/power/support to a person or group of people.<br /><br />at least we have a huge powerful military right?<br /><br />also i had to add this did you see the USA do a victory lap on TV with the &quot;just retired&quot; space shuttle bolted on top of a huge aircraft carrier?<br />doesnt it seem a bit north Korean to flaunt our military/nasa success lol owell..i kinda like it

Am I just crazy?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are far from crazy friend. Welcome to America, where nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />When you look at Western society objectively, a few main things stand out. The first being the fact that this country, is completely driven by greed, the act of seeking power and/or more power or simply keeping the power you have, and materialism. Those 3 things alone, are practically the reason for every domestic as well as foreign policy this country practices. The drug war is just one part, in a much much larger scheme, because remember who profits majorly from it; primarily the cartels.<br /><br />Look further into American history and puzzle will slowly become complete if you have the capacity to understand and piece everything together.<br /><br />I just want to say this. We, or those who live in the USA, have become docile. Content with our existence even. You&#039;re just millions of pawns being shuffled around on a gigantic chess board for the benefit of few, without even acknowledging or caring that you have become this. Everything Western society does, literally EVERYTHING, is for the complete distraction of it&#039;s &#039;citizens&#039;. You&#039;re forced into a life centered around money and materialism. Your status is dictated completely by your title and career choice, and not your beliefs, views, and actions as a human being, but your actions in the corporate world as a &#039;productive&#039; member of society. Many have become oblivious to the realities and truths of LIFE itself in which they become entranced by the trivialities of life, and the true trivialities become your very essence. When we are born, we do not dream of riches, fame, power, or any other superficial/materialistic notion you can mention. We do not hope to win the lottery or eventually live in a 10,000sqft mansion. We are simply happy to experience life, experience what is has to offer, even though we don&#039;t know it. Our existence is far deeper and more beautifully extravagant than we can even begin to imagine, but we are oblivious to that fact because we are made, and choose to be oblivious to it.<br /><br />The fact that all of us are hear on SR, is a very small step in seeing the truths that this society seems to think it can hide from us. The fact that the war on drugs has failed, and drugs themselves are demonized to the point of no return, is simply a small glimpse. Read, and become aware. For when we are aware, we have the ability to act on that awareness, and actually do something about these invisible shackles we have tied to money, greed, and materialism. Because when they are gone, you can truly understand the meaning of freedom.

It was true in the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s when they needed a reason to lock up communists, as well. And right on up through the 80&#039;s when a nice young white kid would do max 5 years for some cocaine, but a young black hoodlum would do 20 for the equivalent in crack. The drug war has always been hugely racist, to the point where (more) progressive judges have recently acknowledged this and actually reduced penalties for crack possession.

				The conspiracy theory might make sense if any other thing in American society made sense. Nothing our country does makes sense. Therefore it only makes sense that our drug policy makes no sense.<br /><br />The accumulation of laws passed by each succession of self interested congress has made all of our systems a complete cluster fuck.

				only corporations like pharma corps are allowed to sell drugs in the USA so the government get&#039;s it cut. pills enslave the people into passive compliance and order. marijuana and other drugs were outright banned by Nixon and Reagan because they feared the populance wouldn&#039;t put up with war mongering, and become pacifists during the cold war. nothing worse than stoned hippies pointing out your war is fascist. make drugs illegal and get them off the streets and out of the media, the war machine rages on<br /><br />

				exactly why would the government\<br /><br />&nbsp;want you to be able to grow a remedy in you back yard?<br />the prescription drugs are far more wild and abused then weed...<br /><br />this is what people dont understand the government and RX facility&#039;s are hand in hand.<br /><br />SO would the government make more money or less money with the legalization of marijuana?<br />are we underestimating in mass proportion the amounts the government makes off depression, anxiety, pain meds?<br /><br />I always thought the government would make more money with ganja legalization<br />&nbsp;and our nation would be a better place&nbsp; <br /><br />but someone in the oval office disagrees...it isnt about health. it cant be, theirs to many advantages of legalization:my favorite is biting a HUGE chunk out of street thugs/gangs/giant cartels pockets.

				Whelp. It&#039;s a big cycle of profit. Wherever there&#039;s regulations or therefore lack of; someone&#039;s profiting. We all know that the CIA works to smuggle drugs in this country; in fact many shipments have been caught being smuggled into the UK. Big Pharma gets more profit by selling addictive drugs for &quot;mental disorders&quot;... anyone classified as disobeying the social norms is considered to have some sort of mental disorder! So cool, they&#039;re fucking up our individuality and chemically unbalancing our brains just for money. <br /><br />The illegal drugs are usually illegal because they sell for more that way; the CIA&#039;s also known to be affiliated with the Mafia, Mexican Cartels, and other crime rings not just in America but across the world. In fact, one of the biggest instigators of the Afghanistan War was their government&#039;s burning of opium fields. That&#039;s where we got 90% of our heroin, fuck no CIA doesn&#039;t want that happening. Soon after we had reason to invade and stop it; they used a Saudi Prince called Usama bin Laden as their figurehead even though he didn&#039;t have shit to do with Afghanistan. I can speak Arabic and let me tell you guys, the speech translations our news channels provided for Usama&#039;s speeches weren&#039;t even remotely close to anything pertaining to terrorism. But if you trace history back, Usama and his dad were close friends with Bush family, back during Bush Sr&#039;s presidency; they merely called in a favor and met with Osama before putting this plan into play. This meeting is also documented by our government. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t a conspiracy; it&#039;s truth. We&#039;re just getting fucked by the rich and they employ the Government as their condom so they don&#039;t have to pay us child support.

				On this tangent, it seems a bit crazy to me that in the US, source of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;, ibogaine, which has been shown clinically to be a powerful addiction interrupter in the majority of cases, remains a Schedule 1 drug, alongside crack and heroin, deemed to have no medical use and a high addiction potential. Anyone who has experienced ibogaine personally is likely to strongly disagree with this classification... Here is a tool from nature, that has the power to set addicts free, and it remains grouped with the same substances that are the source of these addictions. Crazy.

It&#039;s a big cycle of profit. Wherever there&#039;s regulations or therefore lack of; someone&#039;s profiting. We all know that the CIA works to smuggle drugs in this country; in fact many shipments have been caught being smuggled into the UK. Big Pharma gets more profit by selling addictive drugs for &quot;mental disorders&quot;... anyone classified as disobeying the social norms is considered to have some sort of mental disorder! So cool, they&#039;re fucking up our individuality and chemically unbalancing our brains just for money. <br /><br />The illegal drugs are usually illegal because they sell for more that way; the CIA&#039;s also known to be affiliated with the Mafia, Mexican Cartels, and other crime rings not just in America but across the world. In fact, one of the biggest instigators of the Afghanistan War was their government&#039;s burning of opium fields. That&#039;s where we got 90% of our heroin, fuck no CIA doesn&#039;t want that happening. Soon after we had reason to invade and stop it; they used a Saudi Prince called Usama bin Laden as their figurehead even though he didn&#039;t have shit to do with Afghanistan. I can speak Arabic and let me tell you guys, the speech translations our news channels provided for Usama&#039;s speeches weren&#039;t even remotely close to anything pertaining to terrorism. But if you trace history back, Usama and his dad were close friends with Bush family, back during Bush Sr&#039;s presidency; they merely called in a favor and met with Osama before putting this plan into play. This meeting is also documented by our government. <br /><br />This isn&#039;t a conspiracy; it&#039;s truth. We&#039;re just getting fucked by the rich and they employ the Government as their condom so they don&#039;t have to pay us child support.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You got any reputable sources?&nbsp; I just wanna see.<br />Though I certainly believe it.

All of it would be many different sources, ranging from ex-cia agent-written books to government records on public display.
