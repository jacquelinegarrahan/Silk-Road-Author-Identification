				I think most of us have gotten drunk when we were under our country&#039;s legal age. Me and my mates got one of our mates brothers to buy it for us. We drank White Cider (Disgusting stuff) and got pissed. When I first started smoking, the age to buy cigarettes was 16 and shops weren&#039;t fussy if you looked under 16. Now in the UK it&#039;s 18 (Got raised in 2007).<br /><br />Sometimes I see&nbsp; a gang of kids waiting outside the shop asking people to buy cigarettes for them. (I&#039;ve also been asked before).<br /><br />My question is, is this frowned upon? Personally I don&#039;t see it as a problem, if they look 16, I don&#039;t see it as a problem. Being a smoker myself, I know what it feels like to need a cigarette.<br /><br />Just wondered what your thoughts were on this...

				I remember when i was 17, I purchased a fake ID for Â£40! It worked though, but not in clubs. I was able to buy alcohol and cigarettes from shops and pubs with no problem.<br />It seems its all got a bit tougher recently though with all this hidden cigarettes shit. I&#039;ve been asked on several occasions to buy for underage smokers, and every time i have done. Just because at the end of the day its their choice to smoke, no one should be able to tell them not too and I&#039;m a nice guy lol. Obviously I wouldn&#039;t buy for a group of 12 year olds, but if they look 16/17ish, then I&#039;d happily do it. <br />I also believe if they don&#039;t get their nicotine or alcohol fix, they&#039;ll easily just end up with their local street dealer, taking cut, unpure and dangerous drugs. Unless they find SR of course. ;)

				You have a point there GT, it&#039;s so much easier to buy drugs than it is alcohol when you&#039;re under 18. Especially Weed, some people in my school sold it, bought an oz and sold it in 10 and 20 bags so they had a few grams left for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;+1&nbsp; back to you RD.. that made me laugh. I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t have to ask complete strangers. I&#039;d go bright red in the face and everything, get nervous easily enough as it is.<br /><br />I&#039;m not too bad mate, thirsty for some Drone though... Have you tried it yet? I haven&#039;t had a nice line of Drone in over a month. My internet connection was fucked, didn&#039;t want to go on a friends computer as none of them know about SR. And fuck an internet cafe. <br /><br />Feels good to be back! Got 7 coins to spend, time to have a little look through the marketplace. Fuck getting H or Meth, though the H really did impress me... Impressed me too much even, I can see myself making a habit out of it, so I&#039;m staying clear.<br /><br />How are you mate?<br />

				Yeah I&#039;m good ta mate. Yeah I got some of Lims pre ban drone. It&#039;s not my cuppa tea TBH. I mean it&#039;s nice if you do enough of it, I had to do nearly quarter gram lines for it to hit me, but it fucking ruined my nose and that kinda put me off it.<br /><br />Good call on the H mate, I&#039;ve still not done any more and have no intention of getting any more. Tried it, and got out before it was too late :) that&#039;s good enough for me. Saying that I have been playing with the idea of gettin another quarter gram in, but I&#039;ve been good so far

				Yeah Drone is a bastard on the nose. Quarter gram lines, fuck me. Bet it hit you hard once it kicked in? I&#039;ve always found Drone to be really really stimulating, bet you were rushing your face off.<br /><br />Yeah no more H. It&#039;s too hard to give up cigarettes, never mind H if I got hooked. Keep up the good work mate, best not to risk it. Even though like you I occasionally get tempted to have another little go. <br /><br />Might get some Bing from my local Dave. Whats the bet I get crap if I do? Might just wait for my orders to come through.

				Fuck dave in the arse man, that fucker fuckin robs me every time and I still go back for more after a coupla beers &gt;:( no more though, I washed the last bit I got off him in acetone, washed about half gram and I got less than a line back. Not been back since. I&#039;ve done well as well, because I have been proper pissed lately - stopped smoking pot cos it was making me too paranoid, but I think that wash taught me a lesson.<br /><br />Well I wouldn&#039;t say that drone hit me hard, it took that much just to actually hit me at all. Like I said it was nice, but too much abuse for my body for what it did. I&#039;ll stick to necking pills and doing lines a coke. I am a bit weird like that though, I&#039;ve snorted half gram of Mandy before and it didn&#039;t touch me. I need to already be up before snorting it for it to do anything

				Yeah, I&#039;ve decided against giving him a ring. Been thinking about it for a while and decided to stick to SR. One thing I hate is wasting my money - I&#039;ll only end up doing massive lines to even get a half decent effect. You got a line back from a half G? That&#039;s fucking shit, just shows how crap UK coke is. I can understand why you have stopped smoking Weed, it&#039;s always made me feel paranoid and anxious.<br /><br />Gutted to here about that, Drone has always done the trick for me. But each to his own. I&#039;m pretty fucking impressed about them half gram lines of Molly, fuck me. I&#039;d be in a corner clenching my jaw like fuck with unbelievable eye wobbles if I did that. How often do you neck pills?<br /><br />And lol MH, are Lamberts ok? I normally stick to Pall Mall, but the shop was out. These Lamberts burn as fast as fuck.

				I always buy the kids their shit if they ask me. I remember being that age and really, getting pissed up on a park or whatever in Summer isn&#039;t doing anyone any harm and I&#039;d much rather buy them it than have them try and steal it or something like that. Kids will be kids yano, getting drunk on a sunny day is just a right of passage in my eyes. I wouldn&#039;t buy it if they are too young though, say 14 or over.

				As long as the kid doesn&#039;t look like he&#039;s 12 and presents himself in a professional way, I have no problems what so ever doing this. Can&#039;t say I never did it as a kid either, so I&#039;d just be a hypocrite then ::)<br /><br />Honestly it comes down to maturity and responsibility more then age

				Nah I just can&#039;t be bothered cos I&#039;m a lazy cunt. And I&#039;d probably forget anyway, come out with a 4 pack of Stella or something when they wanted 20 lamberts. And I&#039;d probably lecture them on the fact that lamberts are shit, they should smoke proper fags

				Agreed about the Lamberts. Normally I smoke Pall Mall, but the shop didn&#039;t have any in so I went with Lamberts. They burn too fast, fucking Â£6.94 a pack as well. Too expensive considering I go through over a pack a day. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to either transfer to Dollies, or quit. Smoking is far too expensive, I&#039;ll be better off financially if I quit. I&#039;ve said this to myself so many times though - Can&#039;t see myself smoking Dollies, shitty horrible taste and the filter always gets red hot towards the end.

				Pall Malls are what I smoke when I&#039;m low on $ since they&#039;re the cheapest here, the menthols are actually not that bad. I only smoke menthols really, not too big a fan of regulars (except Marlboro 72&#039;s, no idea why.
