				Believe me fella, it&#039;s a fucking trip to Trumpton.<br /><br />Sounds good you eager beaver, keeping busy is good for the soul. And yeah not bad, just about finished Batch 3 so having a clearance sale and the LSD is slowly plodding along.<br /><br />And lol at them bitching about having no money and yet they have a massive tv and iPhones and have to be given poor-soup by an American Christian.<br /><br />

				I can&#039;t explain the emotions that go through my head when I watch that shit!<br /><br />Like my head just goes &#039;Rage, violence, anger, murder, tearful, explosions, crying babies..&#039; It&#039;s a shame we have to live with those kind of people here in the UK... Seriously makes me think about using that Cyanide listing on the road&nbsp; :o lol<br /><br />See when that cunt said &#039;I worked for 23 years, I think I deserve something back from the government&#039; that annoyed the cunt outta&#039; me.. Fat wanker should get a grip of his life and stop impregnating his dog of a bird and get back to work to support his kids or those we fuckers are going to think it&#039;s acceptable to do the same thing as their father. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For all you American roaders.. Welcome to the UK, where we treat our veterans like shit, and our illegal immigrants like gods.
