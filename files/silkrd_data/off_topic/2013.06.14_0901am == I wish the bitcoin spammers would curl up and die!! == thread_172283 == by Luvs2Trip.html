				appear offline to stop them spamming your PM&#039;s - it&#039;s in your profile somewhere, i&#039;ll try to find it now. they get the names to PM from the list at the bottom of the main page - if you ain&#039;t on it you don&#039;t get spammed

Plus it removes all there threads meaning that its not just as easy as creating a new account they then have to waste their time spamming again!!
