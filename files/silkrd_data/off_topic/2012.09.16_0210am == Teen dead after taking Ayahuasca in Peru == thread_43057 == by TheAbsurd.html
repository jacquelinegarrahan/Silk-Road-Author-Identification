The area is the Madre de Dios jungle region of the Amazon basin bordering Brazil and Bolivia.<br /><br />Nolan, who school officials confirmed graduated from Analy High, arrived in Puerto Maldonado Aug. 17, authorities said.<br /><br />Pineda told local police that Nolan took ayahuasca during an Aug. 22 ritual and was found dead the next day, according to Peruvian National Police Col. Roberto Palomino, who discussed the investigation in a video that has been posted online.<br /><br />Several reports indicate Pineda initially claimed that Nolan had disappeared.<br /><br />Nolan&#039;s mother, Ingeborg Oswald of Sebastopol, traveled to Peru to search for her son.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s like he&#039;s vanished, there&#039;s just no sign from him,&quot; the Rohnert Park veterinarian said in a videotaped interview before her son&#039;s body was found.<br /><br />In the video, Oswald held up a local newspaper story about the missing person&#039;s case and described her efforts to search for him.<br /><br />Police later found Nolan&#039;s body &quot;on property belonging to the manager of this refuge, Jose Manuel Pineda Vargas,&quot; Palomino said in the video.<br /><br />Ayahuasca is a tea brewed with the leaves of a shrub called chacruna, a flowering plant called to√© and &quot;other natural substances,&quot; according to the Shimbre Shamanic Center&#039;s website.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I wonder what happened that made him die, wow.&nbsp; :-\

				Probably being a clueless 18 year old with money all by himself wanting to trip balls with strangers far from home.&nbsp; I&#039;m guessing they&#039;ll find that the Ayahuasca had little to do with it.

				Maybe he was on medication or something. I doubt the Shaman gave a warning about what MAOIs are and why you shouldn&#039;t mix them with almost anything

				id say u were probably right about the kid being on meds. maybe he even choked on his own vomit? surely the ayahuasca itsself is relatively safe (i wonder if others from his group got sick or any neg. effects) seeing as people have been using for fucking ever and even small children consume the brew with no bad effects.

				something else i just thought of, i wonder if they re-dug up his body to re-bury else where? wierd question i know but i just was curious if they would dig up and do an autopsy? it really could be like this kid has lungs fulla puke. and im bettn they probably did dig up n reburry the kid so his parents could have a place to go visit but even if an autopsy said it was something other than the brew, this kid will be the new poster child for not doing ayahuasca.

				it appears that there was way too much brugmansia (datura / scopolamine) in his brew, and that the poor kid was left out in the jungle without any supervision. <br /><br />http://forums.ayahuasca.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=21673&amp;start=165
