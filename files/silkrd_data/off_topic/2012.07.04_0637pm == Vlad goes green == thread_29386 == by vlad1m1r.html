				Dear all,<br /><br />As if my boyish charm and lightspeed turnaround times* weren&#039;t good enough reasons for Brits/Europeans to use my cash to Bitcoin service I am pleased to announce that thanks to an e-book I obtained from the excellent CaptainPicard my partner and I have succesfully been able to build a small Wind Turbine from parts taken from a dryer, pieces of a former shopping trolley and a broken camera tripod(!)<br /><br />Her father also very kindly loaned his lathe to make the blades and installed it on the roof&nbsp; - we tested it over the weekend and it&#039;s output (kWh) is greater than that of my laptop and router combined - if anyone does own their own home and want to save money by doing the same I&#039;d be more than happy to send you the plans I used.<br /><br />Keep it green.<br /><br />V. (the jolly green Bitcoin Vendor)<br /><br />*There&#039;s no praise like self praise...

				Are there any inventions for generating electricity from constant, miserable pissing down rain? I could start my own power station here.<br /><br />Love to see the plans, sounds like it could be my next lil project. I bet if you had a grow room on the go a few of these turbines would keep your electricity bills looking a bit.... greener&nbsp; ;D

Say &quot;Vlad goes green (again)!&quot; ? :-D<br /><br />Fortunately I live in an area where there&#039;s always a little wind - my real worry is what&#039;s going to happen when it gets really breezy and the turbine goes into overdrive and begins to melt taking a core sized nugget of my rustic farmhouse with it as it&#039;s reduced to useless slag due to overheating... still it&#039;s a start, perhaps the question we should really be asking ourselves is what will happen when there&#039;s no coal left? Hint: &quot;Go Nuclear&quot; is not the right answer!!!<br /><br />V.<br /><br />
