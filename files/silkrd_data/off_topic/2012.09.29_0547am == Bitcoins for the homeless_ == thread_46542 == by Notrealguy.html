				Well I was reading on another forum about this homeless chick. She has a blog called &quot;Homeless Jackie,&quot; and I found out she got involved with BitCoin.<br /><br />I was wondering is BitCoin this damn useful? She cashes out via SR with one of the vendors for Greendot so she can not worry about food for a while she told me. I find this girl to be intriguing to say the least, smart as all hell since she took flying a sign to a whole new fucking level (An innovator to say the least). She even mentioned SR once or twice, I don&#039;t know how you guys feel about this but its an easy google search regardless of her help. <br /><br />Well here&#039;s the link if you wanna check it out<br /><br />http://homelessjackie.com

				^ If you guys are wrong then you&#039;re being real jerks.<br /><br />Knowing how the internet works doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ve a place to live.

There are no &quot;mob&quot; type gangs over here, and certainly no organised crime syndicates. The &quot;Irish mob&quot; are, funnily enough, almost entirely exclusive to the US. There are drug gangs, of course, but they keep to themselves as much as possible (except for the odd murder over turf) and certainly have no control over any cities, and only minor influence over small neighbourhoods in which they themselves live - mostly because that neighbourhood consists nearly entirely of gang members and their relatives. These areas are limited to small parts of Dublin, and one specific area in Limerick. They are not &#039;lawless&#039; areas though - crime is actually very low in these areas due to the large police presence.<br /><br />I think you&#039;ll find that criminal gangs have much more success and power in larger cities such as London, New York, Chicago etc. There are only 5 cities in Ireland; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Of these 5 cities, Dublin is the only one with a population of over 1 million, with Cork (the next largest city) having a population of just 198,500. The smallest city is Waterford with a population of 51,500.<br />Ireland is not a &#039;fishing state&#039;, it is a knowledge-based economy centered around the service and technology industries. In fact a 2005 study by &quot;The Economist&quot; found Ireland to have the best quality of life in the world, a finding which directly contradicts your statement.<br />As someone that lives here, as opposed to just visiting, I can tell you that your comparison between Ireland and a state that &quot;is either depraved, mafia controlled ghettos or little fishing villages&quot; is completely inaccurate.<br /><br />The reason that the person in question cannot find work or a place to stay in a mega-metropolis is because a) they aren&#039;t willing to take any job that comes up, or b) because any job that they can find won&#039;t afford them a high enough wage to be able to find a place to stay given the higher rents charged in a large city as opposed to lower rents charged in a smaller city / suburban town.<br /><br />- grahamgreene

I&#039;ll keep you updated and mail you when your plane tickets are available.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Seriously though, you should come over sometime, experience Irish hostility (it&#039;s the new Irish hospitality!) and have the craic! Not actual &quot;crack&quot;, but craic craic.. It&#039;s something you&#039;d have to experience to understand! Seeing as I obviously can&#039;t buy ya a beer, let me know if you ever find yourself over here and I&#039;ll send ya a coin so ya can get a couple on me!&nbsp; ;)
