				Hey, so here I am being a dumb analyst again but I strongly believe that the price of BTC will continue to rise until sometime after the 15th.&nbsp; So, you should buy now before they get too high.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />Here is why I believe they will keep rising:<br /><br />The Israel media just hyped bitcoins:<br />http://www.betabeat.com/2011/12/30/israel-media-discovers-bitcoin/<br /><br />Bitcoins are about to star in a popular TV show:<br />http://www.bitcoinmoney.com/post/14477298096/the-good-wife-bitcoin-episode<br /><br />And last but not least, check out the current market data. The overall trend is up, there are a few dips but the trend is much steeper.&nbsp; And look at the market depth!&nbsp; The wave of people trying to purchase BTC is much higher than those selling.... so prices should continue to rise.<br /><br />http://mtgoxlive.com/orders<br /><br />http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD.html<br /><br /><br />If I&#039;m right, now is the time to invest to make a quick buck or two, and the time to sell should be a few days to a week after the 15th.<br /><br />What do ya&#039;ll think?

You get paid in bitcoins, so if someone finalizes early you can still just wait before selling your BTCs.
