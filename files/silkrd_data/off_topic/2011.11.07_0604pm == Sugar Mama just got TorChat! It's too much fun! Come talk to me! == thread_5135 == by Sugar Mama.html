				At the suggestion of a member, Sugar Mama just got Tor Chat. I&#039;ve sent the member 1 bitcoin for their fine suggestion (and for flirting). So far I&#039;ve just been chatting with SumYunGai (great guy btw). Come talk to me I&#039;d love to chat and try this out! <br /><br />I&#039;m wdobrjb6ezrdleci.<br /><br />Can anyone talk as to the safety of this? Anything I should do to make it more secure? Is just good out of the box?

				Tor Chat has been broken on and off since 2008, and now has been for over a year, again.&nbsp; :(<br /><br />The last update on the dev log at https://code.google.com/p/torchat/ was on Feb 27, and says:<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Important: Tor 0.2.2.x-alpha is badly broken, hidden services don&#039;t work at all (for all known definitions of &quot;work&quot;). Tor 0.2.1.x (the current stable release) is also broken but not nearly as bad. On a scale from 0 to 100 the stable version works 95% while the alpha release can only connect in about 50% of the time, half of your buddies will seem to be offline, no matter how long you wait. Some of the previous versions of TorChat came with 0.2.2.x, newer ones now come with 0.2.1.x. Unfortunately the tor project does not seem to put any priority on the hidden services, they don&#039;t use .onion themselves and I think they do not even know just how badly it is broken.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Assume any malicious party you connect to can obtain your real IP address, and assume that third parties can monitor your conversations.<br /><br />Don&#039;t use it.

				I cannot stress this enough - BE CAREFUL.<br /><br />not only because of lack of security updates in Tor Chat, but because of the nature of this particular instance itself.<br /><br />Nothing at all against you, Sugar Mama, but I know a FUCK of a lot of guys who have been burned by girls in this business, and online it&#039;s even worse.&nbsp; Watch your flirting, don&#039;t start fantasizing about some words on a page being a double-d with a 26&quot; waist that wants you to ride her until you are near death.&nbsp; That kind of shit sends blood down to your nethers, which means the blood is NOT in your fucking brain, which means you might start saying things you really shouldn&#039;t about coming to visit you in ________ and meeting up at ______ and so on.<br /><br />A lot of the stories I hear of guys getting busted for online shit is because they got involved with a chick online and starting thinking with their fucking (nim)rod instead of their head.<br /><br />Be CAREFUL.&nbsp; Very.

				Yeah, I like to clown around and tease as much as the next guy, but the stakes here are just too fucking high if somebody drops their guard.&nbsp; One of the hardest things about this site, is not being able to make friends, talk about our lives, say where we live, flirt with the girls, meet up, blah blah blah....there&#039;s some pretty serious political pressure, and least in America, to shut this place down *hard*, and, well, I don&#039;t underestimate those boys...<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to end up in some crowded felony tank wondering where and how I fucked up...most of us, we barely know how to protect ourselves on SR, much less on torchat...and I don&#039;t know about anybody else, but I get all forgetful when I&#039;m talking to a &#039;sugar mama&#039; of any kind ... so I avoid...have fun, tho... :)
