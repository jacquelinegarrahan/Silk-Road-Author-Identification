				Hello SR community, sorry to come off as needy, but me and a friend have gotten scammed a total of $164 with our last &quot;Moneypak to Bitcoin&quot; risky vendor selections. First off, I&#039;d like to say DO NOT USE THE VENDOR &quot;BankofBtc&quot;. This motherfucker has pages of fake feedback set up and I just lost a small amount of $84 which isn&#039;t a lot, but I&#039;m unemployed currently so it took me forever to even get that small amount of money, and half of it was a friends. We were planning on ordering some 25i-NBOME and some other small things, and I got tricked by thinking this vendors feedback was legit. I&#039;ve contacted support but I doubt there&#039;s much of anything they can do...<br /><br />I&#039;m not asking for any big amounts from anyone, just what you can do if you can help out. I&#039;d for sure pay this back in the future if I could find a reliable future BTC vendor, so don&#039;t think I&#039;m asking for free coins. I was debating about asking in the spare coin thread, but I&#039;ve done that when short on orders in the past and it was no luck. Here&#039;s my address: 13EDiF4QkqBJZrcn5qRDfAtpyJhUBiyprL<br /><br />-OR-<br /><br />If someone could lend exactly 0.8153 BTC, I PROMISE (you have my &quot;SR family no bullshit&quot; word) to pay it back, 0.8153 was all we initially needed for what we were going to order. I will pay back within 1 month. <br /><br />Someone please help me out here. Thank you all, SR is amazing. Have a wonderful day.<br /><br />Sincerely, the poor motherfucker who is now mining for coin to compensate for being a fool to a scammer once again.

She has helped me out a few times before on $50 MPs and such, but those were the only times and I wasn&#039;t going to ask her again since she doesn&#039;t usually do it. With there being no other options, I had to try to find a vendor who didn&#039;t specifically mention they had a minimum process limit, BankofBtc didn&#039;t mention it so I went ahead and foolishly got scammed...
