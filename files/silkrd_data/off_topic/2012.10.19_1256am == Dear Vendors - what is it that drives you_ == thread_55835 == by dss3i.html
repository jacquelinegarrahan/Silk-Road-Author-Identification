				Yesterday I was studying when the TV caught my attention. A crystal meth seller had been sentenced to 10+ years in jail. My jaw dropped. 10 years is a big chunk of life right there. I&#039;ve heard from friends that the small amounts of drugs we purchase for personal use are actually big enough amounts to put us in jail, but this rarely happens because cops prefer giving a word of warning instead of taking it to court. Buying these small amounts of drugs is a risk I&#039;m willing to take, going to jail for a month isn&#039;t the end of the world and might even be an interesting experience, but 10 years! Holy bananas, there are few things that would make me take such a risk, and drugs definitely don&#039;t qualify. It puzzles me what makes anyone take a risk like that. Can you vendors provide some insight into this - is it for the big bucks? is it for the noble cause of freedom? is it for the thrill and excitement? is it because you couldn&#039;t find another job and there&#039;s nothing else you&#039;re good at? Needless to say, I am thankful for your services and amazed by the risks you are willing to take in order to serve us.

				I don&#039;t want to speak for others, but I think that the most does it for the cash, seems logical to me.<br />Actually it&#039;s not a bad reason, look what&#039;s going on the world, crisis here and there, corruptcy everywhere etc.<br />A few might have also noble reason for offering their services to us, which I really appreciate.

				Money. If you aren&#039;t in it for money and to make your money professionally then you shouldn&#039;t even get into it. Thrill and excitement is a retarded reason and for yahoos. The personal politics is always unique to the individual I imagine.

				Without giving away too much information I will tell you why most &quot;drug dealers&quot; including myself do what they do. <br />Whilst I don&#039;t currently have a vendor account on Silk Road, I plan to in the near future, and have been selling drugs locally for a few years.<br /><br />Firstly, there is the money. There is a significant risk taken, so there has to be money made from it. <br />It&#039;s probably not as much as you&#039;d think. Most dealers have a full-time job, plenty of friends (many who don&#039;t even know about the drug selling) and generally lead a normal life and fit in with society. Of course though there are also the big suppliers who for some reason promote their involvement in drug gangs &amp; thug groups. But still, most large suppliers would never stand out in a crowd. To most people, selling drugs is like a second job. It helps them get ahead and maintain a higher standard of living.<br /><br />Also, I believe that the Government should not have the right to control what individuals put in their bodies. It doesn&#039;t make sense that we can legally buy alcohol and tobacco, yet if we are caught with marijuana we are treated as criminals. Marijuana, MDMA (ecstasy) &amp; LSD are all less harmful and less addictive than alcohol and tobacco. There is no proper reason why they should be illegal. They are very freely available throughout the world already and they have not caused enormous problems. In fact, alcohol &amp; tobacco cause far, far more damage and cost far more than ALL illegal drugs combined. If someone wants to consume ecstasy when they go clubbing on the weekend, why should they be denied that right? Same goes with any drug - The individual should be held responsible for their body and be allowed to consume what they want. It makes no sense that I could go and buy 2 bottles of scotch every day and drink both bottles in a day, every day, for the rest of my life and not be breaking any laws, but if I were to be caught with marijuana I would have to pay a fine, perhaps go to court, even jail if the quantity was large enough.<br /><br />So when supplying drugs to other people, what I am really doing is providing a customer with a product they want. As adults (I don&#039;t sell to under 18&#039;s anyway), I believe they are responsible for their choices and if they choose to consume drugs then they should be free to do so. I don&#039;t sell highly addictive drugs and I only sell drugs I use recreationally, including marijuana, ecstasy pills, MDMA, LSD &amp; amphetamine (NOT methamphetamine).<br /><br />it is 2012 and the country I live in is apparently democratic. However in a true democracy, all individuals should be free to do what they wish, without harming others (violence, thieving, rape, murder). Drug laws are an abysmal breach of personal freedom and Governments around the world are responsible for the impact they have. Current drug laws (prohibition) are clearly not working as there are hundreds of millions of drug users worldwide. Prohibition of drugs is only worsening violence and increases harm drugs do to the users.<br /><br />Whilst I currently sell drugs illegally and do make profit from it, I would much prefer a world where all drugs are legal, and sold only in pure form, which would mean a consistent product and harm would be reduced. Many dealers &quot;cut&quot; drugs to make more money. I do not do this and never will. I only ever sell high quality, pure products and do date, I have never had anybody had any problems with anything I have sold them. The main reason I sell drugs is to provide customers with high quality products at a reasonable price, whilst making a little profit.<br /><br />Whilst I may break federal drug laws in the country in which I am from, I respect other laws. The Government has no right to control what citizens of this country put into their bodies and drug policy is an enormous waste of time, money and law enforcement resources. If drugs were legal, police could spend more time and effort catching murderers, rapists and thieves - people who actually take from society and negatively impact on the world.

				I do it mostly for political/morally driven reasons, i am my own authority irregardless of any &quot;law&quot; my morals are way above any law, plus everyone has a right to do what they want, or put&nbsp; what they want into their own bodies once their only harming themselves if at all, i love the fact that im getting one over on a pack of naive overpaid idiots in government and their uniformed thugs locally on every successful transaction, although you cant be a careless idiot doing this either or you&#039;l be locked up!<br /><br />One of the other reasons i became a vendor was to sell my stuff to buy other vendors stuff with the same bitcoin, im not helping the bureaucrats or the criminal banking sector who fucked our world up that way either or using their currency. Parasites!

When I provide customers with what they want, I get a nice feeling knowing that I have given them a good product for a decent price. <br />I know alot of drug dealers are in it only for the money, but to me the money is just a bonus. There has to be money made to cover the costs of doing business and make some profit as well. <br />Where I live, what I sell is higher than average quality and usually at a lower price which is why I never have problems. I only have a small - medium customer base and I NEVER sell to people I don&#039;t know and I am very careful about what I do. (Obviously this would change if I had a SR vendor account).<br /><br />I am aware that Silk Road can be accessed by people of all ages, but I believe most people who use silk road are adults, and minors who use silk road are probably old enough to know what they are getting into. I would prefer if people under 18 didn&#039;t use silk road, but there is nothing I can do to prevent this, and they will just use other vendors anyway. Or they could find street dealers in their local area. I don&#039;t intend to be a large silk road vendor, but I would like to offer my products to other people.<br /><br />If / when I create a silk road vendor account, I will provide you with the link and you will see my prices will be alot lower than other domestic vendors in my country.

				Vendors selling through SR are likely more intelligent than your average street corner dealer, since they&#039;ve figured out Tor and Bitcoins... so I&#039;m guessing that their motives are more idealistic / &quot;enlightened&quot; than the average dealer.

				People do what lies in their nature.<br /><br />Sure, the money makes it interesting. But there are also a lot of people who desperately need money, that won&#039;t get into selling drugs. And there are drug lords who have more money than they can ever spend, who refuse to retire.<br /><br />It&#039;s not all that logical. People do things, just because it&#039;s what they do.

I will need money to pay for bills, clothes and food, but (big) MONEY never drove me. I suppose it is partly due to not having extra money growing up, so naturally I developed hobbies that don&#039;t cost anything. If I had grown up with money I might have been into horseback riding, designer clothes, motor sports and other expensive activities. I realize this might change; if I have babies I might want a car because I get sore feet from carrying them around everywhere, and if my baby grows up to love horse riding I might want money to pay for that. Up until now I haven&#039;t been driven my MONEY, though. My happiest moments in life, so far, haven&#039;t cost me (or my parents) a penny. Of course this may also be due to the fact that few moments in my life did cost me much. Frankly, if a gold nugget arrived in my mail one day I would need to pay for my friends to be able to participate in whatever I want to spend it on (they also don&#039;t have money and I don&#039;t like playing alone), so it wouldn&#039;t last long anyway.

				Because the idea that you said (and now just switched up for convenience I notice) that just because one sells drugs/commits crime utilizing technology automatically makes you idealistic and enlightened or some kind of revolutionary is when you get down to brass tax quite naive. Yes, some of the vendors here may have politics in line with this and it&#039;s quite clear they do but not all of us fall into this category, some of us may just be here to make a lot of money. It&#039;s foolish to assume that just because you are part of something and subscribe to a certain ethos that all people in the same place do too. Doing that makes you just look like one of the characters from the South Park episode where everyone in San Francisco smells their own farts and die from a massive cloud of smug. It also hinders proper thought and reason because when there is a mass consensus people get lazy and stop thinking for themselves and think &quot;Ah fuck it, I&#039;ll just be part of a group and because I am I&#039;ll enlightened without thinking about it or putting any proper effort it&quot; and then afterwards they&#039;ll start smelling their own farts and looking up when they talk. They may even start taking credit for the really important stuff like civil rights, gay rights like George Cloony did and yano what I wanted to do to George Cloony after that? Take the Oceans box set and smash them round his face while he looked smugly into my eyes and blamed my actions on not understanding the world like a celebrity that lives in a box and has no real connection with the real world.<br /><br />So yeah, in a nutshell stop being from San Francisco and thinking that all vendors think the same thing because that would make us clones rather than individuals. For myself I am not particularly revolutionary at all, I&#039;m far to pragmatic about life to be. For me it&#039;s all about the real Holy Trinity which is the £ the $ and the €. And for the love of Christ, don&#039;t become George Cloony or Madonna or any of those wankers.
