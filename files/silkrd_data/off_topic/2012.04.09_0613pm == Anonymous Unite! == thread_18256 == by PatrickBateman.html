Debt and leveraging are currently legal tools for morally bankrupt corporations and individuals to privatize profit while socializing risk. If you cancel these people&#039;s &quot;debt&quot;, then they profit at the expense of those owed (sometimes the taxpayer). <br />Going after individual greedy banks, polluting/earth exploiting companies like Exxon and BP, or war machine companies like Gen Dynamics/Halliburton seem like the proper use of these white-hat hacker&#039;s skills. I worry that the occupy movement represents people so disaffected by the rigged system that they can&#039;t see that there are good entities that are committing acts of beauty while making money in the world. I would count SR and its mods in that group. I also count the Bill and Melinda Gates fund and Warren Buffet/ George Soros in that crowd. <br />I do think that social, business and governmental organizations can be designed to helpful earthkind and therefore think anarchy is not a&nbsp; good alternative system of promoting health and happiness more than disease and despair. <br />Is anarchy a goal of Anonymous?&nbsp;
