				So i just got into this stuff recently...bit of a noob. Anyway im wondering whats your preference of choice to store this stuff. Unlike weed you cant just throw it into an airtight jar and just grab some when ever you want because its so small and powder-like. Just throw it in a ziplock baggie? One friend said an altoids box which seems like a good idea. Just wondering what other people do.

				A baggie should be fine. If you have large amounts split it and put the baggies you would like to use later in the fridge. Your stuff should be protected from sunlight and outside atmosphere, you can put a few grains of rice in the bag, it will suck the moisture out. <br />Another natural enemy of molly are shady creatures known to us as &#039;law enforcement&#039;. They will destroy your stuff at sight, so hide it well.

				just a quote from erowid regarding the matter :)&nbsp; https://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.php?ID=1768<br /><br />&quot;....Alexander Shulgin has remarked that if MDMA had existed in the time of the pharaohs and buried in the pyramids, it would still be good today.<br />....MAPS has a supply of MDMA for research that was manufactured by Dr. David Nichols and subsequently stored in a safe at Purdue University. When Dr. Nichols tested this supply for purity in 1994 -- eight years after it was synthesized -- it showed no indication of deterioration.<br />If stored in a cool, dry and closed container such as an amber glass vial (avoid excessive heat, light or moisture), its safe to assume that MDMA and 2C-T-7 will both last longer than you will.&quot;<br /><br />I hope i have helped

				gtgeorgz is 100% correct in both matters, the origin of &quot;molly&quot; and of the prevalence of m1 being sold as molly.

				Depends how long you want to store it for I guess. <br /><br />But if stored in a glass vial it would still there long after we&#039;ve gone.
