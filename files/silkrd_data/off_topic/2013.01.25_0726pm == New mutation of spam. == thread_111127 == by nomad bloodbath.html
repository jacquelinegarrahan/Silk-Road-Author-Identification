				If the mods are looking for direction then I think DPR needs to spell out what the policies / rules of the forum are.&nbsp; If DPR is okay with the status quo then keep doing what you&#039;re doing, nomad.&nbsp; I&#039;m of the opinion that the forums are well and fairly moderated.<br /><br />In my world, moderating internet forums does not constitute censorship.&nbsp; I do not expect DPR or anyone else to provide me with a platform from which to spout off.&nbsp; I would not be angry if the mods deleted, edited or moved any of my posts.&nbsp; On the contrary, I would probably be apologetic.&nbsp; I say that because in the time I have been here (since late summer) the mods have only taken action when action is called for IMO.&nbsp; If a member is out of line then the member deserves what s/he gets.&nbsp; This place is fair.&nbsp; I think the admins try to do the right thing by all of us.&nbsp; I love this community and I want to see it flourish and grow.&nbsp; Without mods &amp; some basic rules, SR forums would turn into a shit sandwich, there would be no reason to even come here.<br />&nbsp; <br />To answer your original question:&nbsp; I think ppl should be allowed to say whatever they want to say but I don&#039;t think they should be able to spam the boards with reckless, drug induced, hate filled rants. Those who continue to go on spam benders should be dealt with by the mods (IMO).<br /><br />For me, the line should be drawn when the intent is to harm, hurt or intimidate.&nbsp; Whether the member is stoned or not, the rest of us should not be bombarded with the repeated slamming of blacks, gays and those of the jewish faith.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking basic human decency and basic manners.&nbsp; Note for clarification:&nbsp; I am only talking about situations where members get wound up &amp; start spamming the boards with hate filled rants.&nbsp; I certainly do not mean to suggest that any words, thoughts or opinions should be banned or censored or anything of the sort.&nbsp; I refer instead to the rant threads and the intent behind those threads, they are worse than spam IMO.

				I&#039;m going to agree with the above post about moderating posts intended to be intentionally malicious.<br /><br />Never got my posts deleted however someone disliked my post about a specific event of my childhood, it was a joke of poor taste I realize that now that I&#039;m sober however.... I don&#039;t want to redact it because I feel people shouldn&#039;t look away from this issue(not the censorship issue, its a different one)<br /><br />Anyway I&#039;m stopping here before another shit storm starts on the forums. Most of you would easily recognize what I&#039;m talking about and realize why I won&#039;t take it further than this post.<br /><br />I have a lot to say about the issue of moderating the forums vs. freedom of speech and censorship, but my god.... just read that post. Posting anymore than this is just going to start it all over again.

On one hand Agorists/Libertarians tend to be quite against the flow of information being restricted. Thus, a person who runs an Agorist communication channel is not likely to be in favor of censoring the communications, other than in cases of spam for example. On the other hand, Agorists/Libertarians do think that the final call for censorship is the right of the property owners. It would not be in violation of Agorist principles for DPR to censor the information on the forum that he runs, it is his to do as he pleases with as he is the person who runs it. That said, he is unlikely to personally desire the posts on this forum to be censored, as he is an Agorist.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I may not be your biggest fan kmf (and you know why) but I’m certainly not unappreciative for your contributions in the security section and I can say that you are wasting your time with this idiot as he is merely copy-pasting stuff to spam ↑ the forums, and now is obviously doing the same here and claiming it is own words on the subject. If you followed this guy’s posts, the ones that weren’t locked for his trolling, you will find he is pretending to be a veteran top vendor, but no one has heard of him and he has heard of no one here. You are ≥ valuable on other threads and I’d advise you to not even waste your intellect and time here with him, as you and Roky are not even on the same wavelength or planet even, and he will just waste your time. He has no friends here as his K will indicate, and unlike us will not last here. <br /><br />I don’t know who the phuc you are kmf but I know enough to know he doesn’t deserve your time. It is possible to see from his time sig.s that he has no life, as he spends literally all his time here. I don’t know any “top vendor” that has this much free time, safe to say that myth is busted. He says nothing but trash with all his posts and has a cry whenerver someone points it out, at which stage he goes through the poster’s entire history starting from their very first post. Safe to say…. no life…. Thought you should know as your posts on sec. and phil. threads well thought out and it would be a pity to see you waste time over this moron who has merely copy-pasted something lol.<br /><br />Not trolling.

				I&#039;m just looking at nanpa2001 post (in other thread..... link above) and all the others above, and thinking this thread really did backfire a little for Roky. Epic. No one here think that mods censor things. Everyone, or most, is on board on this issue. I&#039;m glad that people can differentiate the difference between stand-over modding and responding to a threat caused by a parasite. No mod has ever censored someone that I can recall. In fact, if you look at the stuff here, with the allowed swearing and so forth, I think it&#039;s pretty damn generous what we can say here. If some mod censors someone, you can bet they stuffed up pretty badly. I mean, if you find SR forums too tough when it comes to censorship, shit, you must have problems buddy. There IS no censorship. We are given a huge leash. Some trolls are can just never fit in no matter where they go. Oh well. Piss off Roky. :D<br /><br />If someone thinks a mod has gone too far, or, I&#039;ll make it even easier..... has even censored in the first place, raise you hand......? seriously, who has even been censored? b/c it takes a fair bit.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />So in a. to the OP q., see above. 8)

I don&#039;t believe that it would be unfair to say that both SR and the official SR forums ARE, metaphorically speaking, DPR&#039;s house (office building would work better, but it makes no functional difference). DPR built and manages both spaces, has at no point renounced ownership of either, and thus both the forums and the main site are his property.<br /><br />Part of DPR&#039;s strategy for managing the forums is assigning a group of moderators to watch over the boards. But what are they watching for? Well, DPR put in something known as a &quot;Terms of Service&quot; and creating an account on his forum is CONTINGENT (I&#039;ll return to the significance of this in a moment) upon accepting the Terms of Service and thus necessarily contingent upon accepting the work of the mods so long as they do no deviate from their prescribed duties (mentioned above).<br /><br />As I noted earlier, one who has made an account has explicitly accepted (by checking the box) the prescribed work of the mods. If one does check the box indicating that they have read and agree to the Terms of Service and subsequently violate the Terms of Service flagrantly and repeatedly, then that account deserves to be banned plain and simple.<br /><br />Free speech is wonderful, and I doubt that anyone on this forum would seriously contest that. It is imperative to note, however, that in exercising our natural right of free speech we have the responsibility to make sure that we are not infringing upon the rights of others. For instance, in your own house you should be able to say whatever you want, you can curse jews, blacks, women, children, plumbers, that bitch Staci from work, etc. In another&#039;s house first make sure that what you have to say is acceptable to the owner, if it is not, you have no reasonable right to be offended when he kicks you out of his house.<br /><br />This is all from an Anarcho-capitalist perspective which respects the concept of private property.<br /><br />tl:dr&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />If in DPR&#039;s house then follow DPR&#039;s rules; <br />DPR&#039;S rules = Terms of Service;<br />.:. If in DPR&#039;s house then follow Terms of Service<br /><br />EDIT for grammar

				TY for that treebeard. :) I get the fact that you can&#039;t tell someone what they can and can&#039;t say, but you have to draw a line in extreme circumstances I think. Like above, on page of joining Silk Road you agree not to do certain things and it is generous in the extreme. You can do pretty much anything, but bullying, spamming and basically being a dick is forbidden (doesn&#039;t actually say &quot;I agree to not be a dick&quot; but I forget exact words) and Roky Erikson was going out of his way to provoke SR forums management and others on forum. Obviously this is against the rules, it;s there in black and white. If you go to nay other forum or chat room I think you&#039;ll agree it&#039;s more than generous how far we can go. <br /><br />Yeah, Silk Road is not my house. I know. And no one here has a right to tell me what I can and can&#039;t say. True. But you agree to the terms before you sign up not to go out of your way to target or vilify people. Don&#039;t forget people, you might report something to a mod, but admin ultimately make decisions on policy..... when it&#039;s time for a member to go and so forth. Same with any forum or chatroom. Mods are there (in other chatrooms, not here) usually monitor rooms and see if anything needs to be deleted, or a user booted (not banned) but the decision to &quot;handle&quot; someone is not the mod&#039;s job description, it ultimately is up to admin and mgm to make that decision. I have no reason to expect it to be different on Silk Rod forums. <br /><br />If you saw the posts you might have a little sympathy for just what the mods had to put up with and how much of a total wanker this guy was. It must be embarrassing to get &quot;censored&quot; on SR forums, b/c that&#039;s a bit of a challenge quite frankly. <br /><br />Hope this helps. :)<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.<br /><br />[Edit. Lol, I posted this at same time as MagicMan. Okay so he&#039;s put me to shame a little b/c he&#039;s said it better than I have..... but I&#039;d like to bang this (agree with) as it was what I was trying to say, but just a little more polite lol, and without using &quot;dick&quot; or &quot;wanker&quot; once like I did :P]

Booting (and final say) on other forums is usually handled by admin, I assume that as a forum there would be some similarities here. Mods usually don&#039;t make policy, they F1 regulate it and keep site ticking over, sometimes thanklessly. Hope this clears it up.
