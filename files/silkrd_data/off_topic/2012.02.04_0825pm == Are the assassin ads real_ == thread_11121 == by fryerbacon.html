				Hi, I&#039;m new to the deep web, and I have just one question:<br /><br />Are the assassin ads I see for real? You can hire an anonymous assassin for $20,000? Is that true? Sounds like some scam or urban legend to me. I did find a listing for an assassin who&#039;s willing to kill for no money upfront, provided the funds are in escrow.

				one of the BMR assassins just put up some custom listings for a guy who asked for some &quot;problem solver&quot; on their forums. only about 3000 bucks in total... hard to believe.

				Do they have autofinalize on BMR? Seems like a scammer could keep funds in escrow, say they&#039;re &quot;fixing the problem&quot; and wait for autofinalization for funds to get transfered and then become a ghost.

				Actually it sounds more like someone has been playing Hitman for too long... some might even think to have sort of a Batcave in their basement.<br />Not only they exist at BMR, but also at several other onions, like &quot;Assassin&#039;s Market&quot; (whatever that thing is).

				3000 is realistic. Where im from people will do it in the hundred ranges.<br /><br />edit: its a disgusting and cowerdly act. I reread what i wrote and it seemed i condoned it. I said it to identify how sickening it is really. Typically you hear about it on the news/ sources now and again and its a drug addict doing some one elses dirty work for the next hit.<br /><br />to the guy below me, that is disgraceful.

				Most of them seem to charge $10000 upfront + $10000 afterwards.&nbsp; On the offchance that somebody is actually stupid enough to put up $10000 it sounds like a good business plan to me.

				We have had assassins in my country offering their services on the regular interweb from as little as $50....<br /><br />I support peoples right to self defense but this is clearly crossing a line.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also met a few western &quot;hostage/kidnap rescue&quot; people, they will go into the jungle and get anyone out at any cost, ex-military types with a lack of humor, they charge way more than $100,000 for those kinds of things.<br /><br />Ex-military people can easily make $15,000 a month or more doing regular, legit security services with mining and petroleum people in dodgy parts of the world.&nbsp; A &quot;hit man&quot; that claims to be ex-military and will do a hit in the western world for $20,000 sounds way to cheap considering the time involved in planning an op and the increased risk from doing something that is actually very illegal and that very few people would condone.&nbsp; And killing anyone of note (politicians, celebs, big men) should cost a lot lot more.
