				not at all. its a reference to a movie but probably more well known as the basis for the matallica song &#039;one&#039;.&nbsp; it seems to me that the argument for if men are good or bad comes down to &#039;men are bad&#039; and &quot;we all deserve to die&quot;. if empathy were real how maddening every breath I drew would be knowing every ones every pain because&nbsp; in the end life is a curse. call me ingrateful since I&#039;m not a hunk of meat on the table but I am in a metaphorical sense. I feel incapable of choosing who I am; utterly disabled to be me.

				why do we all deserve to die? when we are clearly living :o?<br /><br />also, life is what you chose to make of it. you don&#039;t know this, but not a day goes by in that I don&#039;t have suicidal thoughts. but honestly who doesn&#039;t get them :P?<br /><br />its just a matter of how you feel in the present. I&#039;d make a bet if you changed your life dramatically, you&#039;d see beauty in life.<br /><br />make a change,? start eating healthy, exercise regularly, by building metal, an physical health. strengthens your total mind an body.<br /><br />when you feel good, your usually in good mood right? well it takes effort. not to sound like your dick head jim couch or anything, but maybe you just need a good wake up slap in the face..<br /><br />you know africa an places with high poverty have the lowest suicide rates? why is that? shouldn&#039;t these people be throwing themselfs off cliffs if they aren&#039;t happy?<br /><br />ones initial response could be like well, yeah wtf?<br /><br />but after looking into it you realize its not cause they are unhappy. it cause everyday is a fight to survive. they don&#039;t need to worry bout trying to off themselfs its natural worry everday for people in these situations.. <br /><br /><br />if live everyday like its your last, an one day that most certainly will be true.<br />-Steve jobs.

All humans are capable of evil or bad. Everyone, anyone who says otherwise is a liar. Anyone who says they have never done anything wrong is a liar.<br /><br />As RS said, become healthy and healthiness will reflect around you. All you can do is make the space you&#039;re in a better place for you and others.<br /><br />At the end of the day we&#039;re all fucked due to Human nature.<br /><br /><br />Oh and RS: yeah suicidal thoughts most days. Has made my life more interesting for sure.
