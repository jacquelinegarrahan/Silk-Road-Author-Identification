				First of all Im suicidal but know I&#039;m worth something as a human being. Possibly a lot. I failed to obtain a gun and kill my classmates before graduating... So now Im hatching new plans: I cant target those who left me out of so many fun things. High schools over, that ship has sailed...&nbsp; Maybe I can help change the world...?<br /><br />I was thinking about assassinating corrupt government officials. Among those I want dead:<br />THAT FUCKING WEINER GUY<br />Bush<br />Obama <br />Everyone in congress.<br />Most of those in the senate, some exceptions.<br />The supreme court.<br />Romney.<br />Jail gaurds (hmm interesting one?)<br />City cops<br />Most of the DEA.<br />Attorneys and judges. &lt;---important<br /><br /><br />Opinions? Anyone willing to help make it happen or am I on my own? Advice? I want to do something meaningful before I die. I see myself as the Vermin-Exterminator

				got a feeling you just put the secret service and the NSA into overdrive - a lot of key words there their systems &quot;hit&quot; on - suspect they&#039;re all talking to their counterparts in various regions to connect the IP trail.....<br />you might want to get the coffee on, suspect there&#039;ll be a knock at your door in the next 24 hours<br /><br />Now, put down the bong, push away from the computer and go do your meds

				I don&#039;t think going on a personal vendetta is going to give your death any meaning.<br /><br />Imagine the innocent families you would be destroying. Think of the children, brothers, wives.<br /><br />Killing yourself is selfish enough but killing people you don&#039;t agree with to give your death &#039;meaning&#039; is moronic and psychotic. <br /><br />Take your meds and get your shit together, mate.

				Is it possible that you are feeling suicidal due to some kind of mental illness?&nbsp; That might also explain some other aspects of your post.&nbsp; And if that&#039;s a possibility, have you ever tried seeing a therapist or psychiatrist?&nbsp; Medication and/or therapy might help the days feel better.

				Such violence would probably just translate into more government control, and, the same officials that you hate would be instantly replaced with fresh new droogies.&nbsp; If anything,&nbsp; that will just fuck us more or be covered up to look like something else in order to push another agenda m8.&nbsp; If you want to make some waves, start a rebel organization and have a revolution.&nbsp; I wouldn&#039;t mind you slapping Nancy Pelosi around a bit, though&nbsp; ;D

				Killing a politician is useless there will be many that will take their place and be just as bad. I&#039;m not saying I have a defeatist attitude towards it all, but killing figureheads isn&#039;t even close to a good way of going about it.

				I think it is funny that people care about the children and wives of the politicians who want to take you from your children and wives and throw you in prison. The politicians are not our friends, and violence against them can lead to more change than a million votes. Not that I advocate the OP does anything, he is probably just a troll or very possibly he is LE.

Once you are dead you are worthless. If you kill others you make them worthless as well. You need to realize that there is a meaning in your existence and like all great people the meaning will come to light in time, by living. You must wait, you must live &amp; bide your time. The meaning and the purpose will likely come only after you have conquered your biggest enemy. If you allow yourself to perish your enemy to win and you will not have fulfilled your purpose because you will have never met your meaning. You must wait. You must live. your purpose WILL be revealed, but only in time.<br /><br />Patience if your test. It may take years and years.<br /><br />Impatience is the name of your enemy.<br /><br />Wait.<br /><br />Wait.<br /><br />Wait.<br /><br />Once you have conquered impatience your purpose will be clear.<br /><br />Hang in there tiger.<br /><br /><br />Modzi<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />...heartfelt<br /><br />lovely post Modzi

Politicial leaders are replaceable as well, but if one dies it is possible for one with different ideas to take its place. Police are just soldiers they have little political value. Changing the balance of a political structure from one party to another would have much more effect on society. Unfortunately all political parties are shit.
