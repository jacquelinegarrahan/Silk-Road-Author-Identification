				I recently got an order seized that Dutchqualitybeans shipped me. It&#039;s been over 2 weeks and nothing. I&#039;m debating on whether ordering from Streetpharmacy or Dramsterdam for some beans. I have different address I can ship to. They both have around the same refund policy I believe ~60%. I hope to god I don&#039;t have to go through this again. So far 1st silk road order was not sucessful :(<br /><br />Anyways would shipping to a different address and from a german vendor (streetpharmacy) be better? He&#039;s a little more expensive than Dramsterdam but I could care less almost as long as I receive my shipment.

				You will be fine sending to the same address, but honestly ordering anything illegal from The Netherlands and you have about a 1 in 3 chance of having your package seized. Ordering from Germany seems to be safer however.

				Yeah, I learned the same lesson the hard way as well. Well it wasn&#039;t that hard, lol, nothing bad happened but I didn&#039;t receive my pills. I&#039;m never ordering anything from the netherlands again, you might as well stamp &quot;THERE ARE DRUGS IN HERE&quot; on any envelope that comes from there, it seems like, LOL!<br /><br />I have not tried yet, but I assume a package from the UK, EU or Germany would not be quite as suspicious, thus more likely to make it. I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed that these US vendors will come through and be good people, cause I&#039;d feel so much comfortable with that..

				If I ever ordered to the address again it&#039;d be a smaller order just in case.

				try street pharmacy, his brown rolex&#039;s I hear are good and slim so they will not be bulky in an envelop.&nbsp; Reading this makes me count my little blessings, I am in america and have got 4 back to back successful orders from 3 different vendors in holland, 1 with pills, 3 with molly.

				Order molly instead of pills, it will make it through customs much easier because it&#039;s so much less bulky. Can easily fit in a normal envelope.

				If you&#039;re in USA you shouldn&#039;t have any problems with a well packaged molly from canada.&nbsp; You have a good chance of getting a well packaged molly from anywhere, even NLs, but mail from Canada is just..normal.<br /><br />Bubble mailers are highly suspicious for international mail, you have a decent chance of seizure no matter where it&#039;s coming from, and bubble mailers from NLs even moreso.

				Yeah I&#039;ve already experienced a seizure for my first order which sucks!.<br /><br />if this next order fkcing fails I&#039;m going through canada. I mean we don&#039;t even really police the borders I&#039;d assume mail from canada isn&#039;t screened as tough

				I&#039;d really like to hear about Streetpharmacy&#039;s Brown Rolex, the quality of the product and specific details on how much they enjoyed or didn&#039;t enjoy it.&nbsp; I am planning to order some in the next few days.&nbsp; Seems very promising for sure.
