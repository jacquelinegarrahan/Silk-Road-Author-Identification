				I feel like Steve from Blue&#039;s Clues when the mail runs. Even when I&#039;m driving around, if I see Postal truck, It gives me bubbles in my stomach.

				One time I went over to one of my one-time-use drops... someone I paid to accept the package in their name. And they like, made WAY too big of a deal of it. Like, peaking out the blinds, pacing, opening the door the SECOND the doorbell rang. I sat back and just thought &quot;these people are ridiculous.&quot; and I was like, &quot;here ya go thanks&quot; paid them, handed them the address info from off the package, and walked out the door.<br /><br />I find most of my drops act very casually, as if it were just any old piece of junkmail, and I&#039;ve had all the same people receiving for me; except that one person and her boyfriend. So dumb... lol<br /><br />You have a package coming with drugs in it... would it be best to be excited/nervous and anxious? Or poised and nonchalant? ....in the event of a Controlled Delivery?<br /><br />&nbsp;:D In my mind I&#039;m always excited tho. Always.
