				Are you people serious? You&#039;re seriously asking people where to get drugs and how to do them on the fucking intarwebz? Holy shit. This is the saddest bullshit I&#039;ve ever witnessed. Not only are you freaking detached from the real world, you can&#039;t even fucking detach from it like a normal dumbass and go figure it out in the damn real world you&#039;re detaching from. Get off your fucking computer and go experience life asshats.
