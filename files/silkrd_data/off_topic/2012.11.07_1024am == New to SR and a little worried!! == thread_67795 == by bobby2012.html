				Hi everyone,<br />Im from downunder and have only been a member for a week.I have placed a fair few orders in this first week and i am very happy with 99% of vendors,although one vendor is making me worry.<br />He has not too bad of feed back so i decided on a substantial purchase,he said to fe as im in australia which is fair enough. My concern is communication before i fe was really quick and responsive, i ordered late thursday night and fe on friday,the vendor said because of the weekend the order will go out tuesday via a tracked shipping service.<br />&nbsp;Now i have sent him a couple of pm he only responded to one this morning saying it would go out. Now i have sent him 2 other pm to get an update on whats going on but no response and i can see that he has logged on but hasnt bothered to check my pm. <br />Just wanting members opinion on what can i do or what should i do or should i be worried?<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />B2012

				My opinion is that you should chill out. I know at the start, the idea of getting drugs in the mail is a bit overwhelming, but as time goes by, it is easier to be patient and relax. <br /><br />The vendor answered one PM, telling you when it will go out. What else do you need to know? He probably has loads of PMs from other customers as well. I&#039;m not trying to sound harsh at all by the way. I was fretting like that when I placed my first orders also. These vendors are busy, so answering shit loads of PMs must delay them a bit. The less that are sent, the quicker the gear will be shipped.<br /><br />Take a deep breath and chill out dude. Hope you enjoy your travels on the road!

				Don&#039;t worry man, sometimes vendors get a lil busy. plus I don&#039;t think he would fuck off his vendor acct for one quick hit, unless you&#039;re talking a couple thousand here.<br />Just politely ask whats goin on and keep an eye on the forums relating to his name...<br /><br />MMM

				Thanks for the replies guys...........The vendor is Dark Moon which i found out through these SR forums can be a selective scammer.The amount was $700 so it was fair bit.<br />Apparently from what i have read on these forums he selectively scams australians.<br />So annoyed,upset and angry. My fault though i should have done more research.

Also, you should definitely check the forums before using any vendor and never FE unless you are totally confident the vendor will deliver. If it does end up being a scam, hopefully this teaches you a lesson. It&#039;s unfortunate you may have had to learn the hard way.<br /><br />sdesu

				Yeah, I&#039;d give it some time.&nbsp; My first vendor was a bit slow but about 4 days in he contacted me and told me he just needed to spread out the shipments.&nbsp; If the reviews for the vendor is good, things should be fine
