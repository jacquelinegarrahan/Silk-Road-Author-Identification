				I found a stray kitty last weekend and now were best friends. I haven&#039;t committed to a name for him yet but so far I&#039;m teetering between logan (as in weapon X, the ole canucklehead) and black peter (as in &quot;the people they know, but the people don&#039;t care, that a man can be as poor as me. Take a look at poor peter, he&#039;s lying in pain. Now lets all go run and see.) He&#039;s the cutest guy ever. He doesn&#039;t play much but I think hes just settling in. Like, most cats LOVE string, and if you make them chase a string they get really happy! He just ignores string, but he does chase elastic bands. Also that seemed to confuse him. He sleeps at least 20 hours a day, but at night he comes and sleeps on my bed. He&#039;s been coughing and sneezing, probably has the kitty flu. There was one day last week that it rained really hard, and he was probably just cold and hungry, and contracted some sort of illness from exposure, but now he has a warm cozy home, and I am nursing him back to health. I think I like logan as a name, because of this healing factor which seems to be at work. But generally, I think cats are the BEST! When I come home he follows me around my bedroom rubbing his face on my legs and hands, and he says, &quot;meow!&quot; which on various websites which claim to be authorities on cat interpretation, means, &quot;What&#039;s up? Where have you been? I&#039;ve missed you!&quot; and that&#039;s exactly how I feel about my cat! So obviously we understand eachother. How do all of YOU feel about cats? And what should I name this cat? If someone has a REALLY good suggestion I will take it into consideration, but only if its really good, like good enough to make me say, OH SNAP I sure wish I thought of that first!

				Ok, katamine just gives me whack memories of grade 10, and Poster Nutbag? why? He is neither a poster nor a bag of nuts, in fact I really don&#039;t know if he has nuts or not, I don&#039;t know how to check. I only know he is a boy because my friend who is a cat expert told me and was with me when we found him. If anything I would think shitmachine rather than nutbag because he certainly is a little shitmachine, but I finally got a real cat litter scoop with a siv like bottom which works much better than trying to take that shit out with a spoon.

				I love my cat. Several friends of mine have addressed a link between people that love drugs and a love of cats. Many of my friends unanimously love cats and I&#039;ve started to even notice it in popular culture. Maybe its their fortitude of self or maybe people who do drugs are often lazy in many regards (except when it comes to drugs) and cats look after themselves. I think its because they are soft and smell like cookies. Er ist ein Wanderer und ein Bergsteiger, sagte er zu seinem Herzen!

				My vote goes for &quot;Fatty McButter Pants.&quot; It&#039;s been from experience from the stray cats I&#039;ve had (and still have a few) that they temporarily overcompensate for lack of food they&#039;d faced up until found, and start eating like pigs to a troth. I have one former stray cat, who never quit overcompensating, and he&#039;s now started on a diet after he reached 24 lbs! I should make his pic my avatar&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Fatty McButter Pants all the way!!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=44475.msg474781#msg474781">Quote from: davebowman on September 19, 2012, 09:23 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I found a stray kitty last weekend and now were best friends. I haven&#039;t committed to a name for him yet but so far I&#039;m teetering between logan (as in weapon X, the ole canucklehead) and black peter (as in &quot;the people they know, but the people don&#039;t care, that a man can be as poor as me. Take a look at poor peter, he&#039;s lying in pain. Now lets all go run and see.) He&#039;s the cutest guy ever. He doesn&#039;t play much but I think hes just settling in. Like, most cats LOVE string, and if you make them chase a string they get really happy! He just ignores string, but he does chase elastic bands. Also that seemed to confuse him. He sleeps at least 20 hours a day, but at night he comes and sleeps on my bed. He&#039;s been coughing and sneezing, probably has the kitty flu. There was one day last week that it rained really hard, and he was probably just cold and hungry, and contracted some sort of illness from exposure, but now he has a warm cozy home, and I am nursing him back to health. I think I like logan as a name, because of this healing factor which seems to be at work. But generally, I think cats are the BEST! When I come home he follows me around my bedroom rubbing his face on my legs and hands, and he says, &quot;meow!&quot; which on various websites which claim to be authorities on cat interpretation, means, &quot;What&#039;s up? Where have you been? I&#039;ve missed you!&quot; and that&#039;s exactly how I feel about my cat! So obviously we understand eachother. How do all of YOU feel about cats? And what should I name this cat? If someone has a REALLY good suggestion I will take it into consideration, but only if its really good, like good enough to make me say, OH SNAP I sure wish I thought of that first!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				We named our cat &quot;Fluffy&quot; ..it&#039;s hairless<br /><br />I used to hate cats (always had dogs) but after a while we&#039;ve warmed up to eachother (cat still shits on my clothes from time to time and dips its paw in my goddamn drinking water.. bastard&nbsp; :) )<br /><br />We almost named it baldwin, but I think that&#039;s better suited for a furry cat
