				Hey all, I&#039;m looking to discover some new awesome tunes to listen to while tripping... or, hell, while sober too. Any suggestions? Looking for music that is deep, ethereal, melodic, climatic. Something along the lines of Delerium or Amethystium, which if you aren&#039;t familiar with, you must discover yourself.<br /><br />Another suggestion for those who are into weird experimental rock/metal type stuff... check out Secret Chiefs 3.<br /><br />No house music please! Please, god, no house music!

				I&#039;d highly recommend listening to a band called Beach House when tripping. I&#039;ve mentioned them a good few times on here!!! ;) <br /><br />They have an album called &#039;Bloom&#039;, and it is very floaty and happy music, or climatic as you say yourself.&nbsp; I&#039;d especially recommend listening to them after you&#039;ve peaked or when you&#039;re on the way down. Also, if someone was having a bad trip, this album would help turn that around. <br /><br />Here is a track by them, hope you like it:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHjxwHwSRN4<br />

				From your description I think you and I are in the same wheel house for music - Slow(er) Ambient Progressive Trance/Rock <br /><br />When I empathy trip; I don&#039;t like lyrics that can influence my mood of the music and most of the time I don&#039;t like fast beats but more of a melting melody. <br /><br />Slow Ambient:<br />Carbon Based Lifeforms<br />Solar Fields<br />iAwake<br />Kaya Project<br /><br />Trance Rock:<br />Goat<br />(old) Queens of the Stone Age<br /><br />Edit: Just listened to some Delerium and Amethystium, thanks for the discoveries. <br />

				I suggest something really intricate. If you&#039;ve never heard of telafon tela viv I highly recommend him for tripping. Also check out bonobo if you want some easy listening with a lot of cool bells and sounds that are wonderful for that mindset. I listen to both almost every time I trip.

				As Barbijuana said: Solar Fields and Carbon Based Lifeforms. Ultimate trip music.

				Just checked out that Beach House song, very chill, very nice! I will be exploring them some more. I am writing all of these suggestions down, thanks all.<br /><br />Ahoy - Portishead is definitely great.<br />Niriane - I will check that out, and come back to thank you :)<br />Barb - Great suggestions. Yes, I&#039;d say we have similar taste. I will look forward to checking out your suggestions! Glad you are enjoying Delerium and Amethystium. I can&#039;t get enough of the latter lately. Oh, and QOTSA I love. Best rock in at least a decade from those guys. I actually met the band and smoked a joint with them :)<br /><br /><br />Feel free to keep the suggestions coming, can never get enough good music. Here&#039;s a couple more suggestions from me:<br /><br />Daylight Nightlight - The most relaxing music ever, some nice, slow, beautiful stuff. (Lookup a song called &quot;Breath&quot; for example.)<br />Joe Satriani - For those who don&#039;t know him, awesome instrumental guitar trips, mostly upbeat, can be very psychedelic.<br />Conjure One - Similar to Delerium.<br />
