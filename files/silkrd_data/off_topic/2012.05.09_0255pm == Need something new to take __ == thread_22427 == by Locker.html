				Thought you lot would be the best people to answer this, but I&#039;ve been taking different strains of hash for years, but it just doesn&#039;t feel enough any more, need something new to try, any ideas?

				I had a good, spirited evening once that started with with a nice dose of 2-c-t2, was followed a few hours later with my first bit of Ketamine, which led to a half g of coke, and it ended the next day with a lot of heavy pulls on a jar of ether. <br /><br />I haven&#039;t had very many evenings as loaded as this one was, it was truly a rare example of good form. I would recommend any of the aforementioned drugs to try. Coke is not so much for me unless there are other things involved, but if you&#039;ve never done it it won&#039;t be bad. <br /><br />Selah,<br />Eco

				for me, nothing beats a dissociative. xtc and 2c-b if you want a dead, &quot;euphoric&quot; ecstatic feeling. mushrooms are always amazing, too, but I never did get any visuals out of them and I&#039;ve taken a lot.

				I took my first E alone in my room just to bring some flare to an otherwise boring Friday night. Had only smoked MJ before that so it blew my fucking mind. I so wish I saved that experience for a concert/rave.

				I LOVE my hash and decades of occasional use of &#039;harder&#039; drugs has kept me a fan of hash and for the past 15 years a supply of decent bud also. Actually its the hash from bud I usually have. SR has opened up the menu and i now enjoy those easy going hashes - the kind you can smoke in work and get away with it. I prefer buying milder foreign imported hashes. Buying bubble hash is pointless as I get samples all the time. Its ALL potent as hell stuff. Very expensive here but I can see the seller/growers point of view. An ounce of bud sells for Â£240. You get 4 grams of bubble hash if you have a top rated hash producing plant. Little wonder price is high.<br /><br />I NEVER get bored of good hash. But I do like the change.<br /><br />A few months back I found SR and within 34 hr had learned how to buy BTC and transfer them here. I went for a gram of MDMA off Ivory. Kept it for a few weeks. One night I decided to take a very small amount - less than 100mg - maybe 80mg or so. After half an hour I stopped smoking my joint. I felt a BIG grin come over my face and went to to fridge for a can of beer. I had to go out so went out to the pub and had fantastic night. Talk was with older guys - no chicks but a few hugs and I was high enough to enjoy but not so high I was overtly wacked out of my brain.<br /><br />Had I took 120mg - 150 mg I would HAVE to go out to a rave or D&amp;B night with a 4.00am bar. I would redose with 50mg of MDMA which would extend the time being high to 7-8 hours. <br /><br />I had not had MDMA for 10 years or so and only ever took 3 or 4 pills. <br /><br />As someone who loves hash but wanted a different experience I can testify that the good MDMA here (most vendors sell top gear) made for a fantastic night that kind of opened me up a little and allowed me to really just extend the love to people.<br /><br />Had another go a month later. This time 100mg of Ivorys MDMA (after a days party of drink and bud and Afghan gold seal hash) was brilliant. I took the MDMA and half an hour later was clinging to my women and realised how much I cared for her. I was clinging to the sofa and her for the initial come up of the drug - but settled after 20 - 30 mins and was happy to go out to a local club open till 2.00am. Had a great night and felt great when I got in. slept like a log.<br /><br />Thing with MDMA is that the next day your fine - buzzing off the experience you had - positive over a good night. The day after that MDMA has a come down. Its mild with this pure gear most vendors have right now. Europe has plenty of great&nbsp; MDMA in crystal form. Tempting though pills are I think crystal is the wiser choice. A friend of mine took half a white speaker tablet. He was just mildly high - low tolerance, never used before, The girl was rollling too&nbsp; much for a newbie and felt real worried for a while as it was so intense. So my opinion is buy crystal unless you get some pill and crush it to ensure there is no MDMA disparity between users who break a tab in half.<br /><br />As an older guy I got to say MDMA is one of the BEST feelings a drug ever gave me. It was the BEST come down for any potent powder or crystal drug. Made coke seem laughable as UK coke is so bad it makes you feel moody, twitchy, kind of pissed off almost. The MDMA off Ivory is top choice for a newbie looking to make a first purchase. Ivory always delivers. He or she always sends quality MDMA out - REAL quality. Evn though buying UK MDMA is more expensive its worth it. But that said the same top quality MDMA is sold by many vendors in the EU. Its cheaper to buy 5 grams from non UK vendors but obviously its a risk. For your first gram of MDMA Ivory will not disappoint. MDMA is so good I limit my use very strictly!!! You will not lose the magic if you space those uses. I enjoyed more my third time than both previous times. Never took more than 100mg. I suspect 150mg at a rave will be even better!!!<br /><br />Cannot wait!<br /><br />MDMA is safe for a new drug as it is kind to you. no chance of ending up in a psych unit like with hallucinagenics. <br /><br />Coke is an EASY drug to use but finding good coke is like finding the holy grail!! In the UK - good coke usually means some white powder wrapped in a wrap of glossy paper. you snort it and want to argue with the wife and you lose your libido which messes up the classic making up after the argument sex deal.<br /><br />So my advice is go for MDMA if your old enough to do that!<br /><br />And eat 2 grams of hash the day after the next day. If you have good hash then eat 2 or 3 grams sitting in some nice natural surroundings. Nothing like it. Have someone to keep an eye on you and not for beginners. start with half a gram of hash - less if its bubble hash. A gram of that will do 4 novices. I would personally eat 3 grams of bubble hash. Ate 5 grams of top Moroccan hash at a gig once. It was fab. Recommend it for the bucket list.<br /><br />My bucket list is like a list of drugs really.<br /><br />Why parachute when you can drop some mescaline?<br /><br />Why bungee when you got LSD or maybe some shrooms?<br /><br />Someone here said they had no visuals off mushrooms! Try the Liberty Cap UK mushrooms. Take enough of them and EVERYONE hallucinates - full blown visuals of other worlds - not just a few traces and wallpaper patterns changing. Wow. the last time I ate mushrooms I saw a field full of skulls and dancing ladies in the lake.<br /><br />So - my advice - find a good good friend or two and take the E with them. Try to have someone who is sober and a baby sitter. Do NOT be tempted to buy pills at a rave. As far as I know everyone who died from E died from pills and went to a rave were people dance insanely. Take a break to chill out. Dance a while then chill. Drink fluids but no more than usual daily allowance ever. Try to eat well before the evening is starting. Alcohol is goos if the E is too instense forr you. Weed will also calm you down and take the edge away. But be careful not everyone has that reaction. <br /><br />Be with people you trust using drugs.<br /><br />Smoke weed or hash on your own. Everyone does that. but never do coke or E or other stimulants on your own. Keep them as social drugs. special drugs for special evenings out with friends or whoever you can step out with. <br /><br />Good thread as I am no expert and many people out ther have tried drugs I have not tried. I like new drugs. i like the idea I can try something new but like to know what I am getting into.<br /><br />One drug you ought to NEVER try out of curiosity is heroin!<br /><br />Its been said before - and even heroin users will say it - but this drug is TOO GOOD. Some drugs are fantastic - like e or great coke - sometimes good speed, but yu know you can only use a few times a year. Heroin, is fantstic but its a drug that really does call you in for more. Its so good that your brain itself is pretty much trying its best to convince you. your body also remembers good drugs and will call for them. Heroin is a real naughty drug - the WORSE to ever think you will just try a little go of.<br /><br />but hey - heroin vendors here do a service, Heroin users are treated like scum in the real world. Its good they have SR to buy clean gear off vendors who do not bully and intimidate and short sell and weaken the product to the point that evne injecting barely makes them feel a thing. Heroin vendors do nto force anyone to use. Nobody points a gun. but many of them would say its stupid to use it. Maybe some sell to fund the own supply but most do not use in real life.<br /><br />So first drug of no choice is heroin.<br /><br />MDMA seems the natural first try of something else. Get the setting right. Get some friends to maybe throw in for a gram or something. Chooe crystal and its safer and more accurate to dose than pills.<br /><br />Odds are you will come back and thank those who said MDMA. got to say, it is really good. My guess is many abused it a little - instead of using maybe 1 gram per year they used 10, 20 or a lot more! That does condition the brain I guess - makes it less easy to actually feel the effect to its full. So use with caution. In my book, the price of good MDMA costs less per 100mg than a pint of lager,<br /><br />As for &#039;foxy&#039; or methedrone - my mate projectile vomited on this and only rescued his night when he got a half gram of coke off a buddy and recovered after a few lines. Nobody rated the mephedrone. Seemed &#039;unclean&#039; and a bit dirty. This was pre ban days and the gear was pure as.<br /><br />Other RCs are a risk as they are RCs and so we do not know what to expect, Many RCs are really low dose so you got to be careful as hell,<br /><br />Amphetamine is good if you get some good amphetamine. I have four amphetamines butnot used one as I know a good one will see me binge a little. In the 80s taking half a gram of the usual decent speed saw me up for 24 hours even after a drink in the pub and smoking non stop hash. The speed here on SR - you need to take more than 100mg to feel&nbsp; most. Shme really. Good speed is way better than coke IMO. Especially when its just a drink session, stag do or hen night for the ladies. Speed is cheap. If its good it brings energy. Always used to be the poor mans alternative to coke. but the older you get the more the after effects hit you. speed does punish you a little the next day - lol. But when young it was not bad and worth the great night it bought. Can be addictive especially if you are shy.<br /><br />Crack is also a bad choice. Well - some use it with sense and its a holiday for them every few months. Usually its a fast track to addiction.<br /><br />Good luck. Go for the MDMA. Best bet really considering.
