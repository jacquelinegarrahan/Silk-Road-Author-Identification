				So, I was just enjoying some of CannaGrrl&#039;s dynamite Lemon OG Kush (which I reviewed here http://wall.alphacoders.com/wallpaper.php?i=15477) and thought I would make a thread for all of SR&#039;s consumers. :-)<br /><br />Post here if you&#039;re fucked up just a little or a lot.&nbsp; Just had a conversation with God while on shrooms?&nbsp; Let the world know about it here!&nbsp; Climbing out of the K-hole?&nbsp; Make a post!<br /><br /><br />Freeman

				Yesterday I was tripping balls on MXE. I made an epic 3 hour play list in iTunes and got some awesome music visualizers for my iPad. LOL I even blasted Dark Side of the Moon for the first time in years. That shit is played out, yet somehow with the MXE it sounded new.

Opiates are such a great way to unwind and relieve the discomfort of a long, busy day. Opiates truly are the nectar of the Gods.

				well you guys it really depends on your psychedelic experience.<br /><br />you can break it down into 3 classes<br /><br />like this :<br /><br />-lightweight - little to no experience with psychedelics, probably took shrooms once or twice, but has no idea what hardcore tripping is, more likely to freak out or not be able to handle the intensity of the trip. for this person i would advise small doses&nbsp; like what watmm said, to become familiar with it, and lots of meditation prior to smoking it. respecting the spirit is always advisable. just continue double dose after you become familiar with one amount. <br /><br />-middleweight - moderate experience, has taken shrooms multiple times, maybe lsd, or mescaline, once or twice. most likely this person has had one or two difficult experiences but they managed to overcome them and continue to do psychedelics, that kind of experience helps a ton when doing dmt because you need to be used to your mind being completely blown away. 50mg of pure dmt would be a perfect starter dose. changa is better because it smokes better and more evenly(effects you better and doesnt taste so much like shit)<br /><br />-heavyweight - Basically someone who has done every psychedelic they can get their hands on, someone who loves to trip and has done it a multitude of times. I dont even really think i need to explain this any further, you folks know who are ;) perfect dose for a heavyweight would be 75mg 100mg. yellow is more intense, white fluff is smoother. i would do 100mg of white <br /><br /><br />***DONT EVER OVERDOSE ON DMT*** <br /><br />make sure you weigh your dose accurately, dont be scared to smoke it all once you have weighed it and know it is right.<br /><br />i would never advise going over 100mgs until youve smoke 100mg dose at least 5 times, then move up slowly. if teleporting is your goal, you need to ease into it, never dive in head first.<br /><br /><br />

				By those standards i&#039;m a middleweight: High tolerance to lsd and psyclobin as far as visuals go but one particularly difficult K hole.<br />I&#039;m still inclined to start small with any new drug though. I just don&#039;t want it being unpleasant, like Salvia, to the point that i&#039;ll have preconceptions interfering with the next trip, so this talk of starting moderate to breakthrough is interesting.

I get very extroverted and love to move my body. Its the surrounded by 500 people in a club listening to blaring loud music that gets me running home. On the other hand, hanging out with 2-6 friends in almost any setting on E is great. No matter how extroverted I get, I just never get the club. :)

				I just had a breakfast of champions. 10MG dextroamphetamine oral, 2 x Norco oral, 1G of Black Hindu direct blast.

				Hey there =)<br /><br />So, I&#039;m tripping since some hours on really good amphetamine, stealing my sleep.. it&#039;s 7:45 around here, I&#039;d love to go to bed but no way =D So I just decided to register and lurk around here a little bit..<br /><br />Two days ago I returned from my holiday, and had a date with a girl I&#039;ve been hitting on for quite some time now the same evening.. Was completely clean the two weeks I was away, so I couldn&#039;t wait and took about 200mg of tramadol.. not that much, but my &quot;detox&quot; made it hit me like a giant wad of cotton wool, fired at me from a ship&#039;s cannon at point-blank range :D<br />The date was, to my surprise, going really well, even though I must just have been standing there and talking to her about just EVERYTHING that came to my mind .. sweet, sweet opiates, bad, bad increased urge to talk :D<br /><br />So.. she got quite drunk (we club we went to had it&#039;s 15th anniversary, and offered 150 litres of free beer, quite an offer!), and as I never drink alcohol anyways, it wasn&#039;t suspicious I didn&#039;t join her &quot;legal drug use&quot;.<br /><br />It all ended up in my bed, shit that girl was burning hot (natural redhead, need I say more), drunk and requesting me to some more action..<br /><br />So, what happened.. she went to the bathroom, and I fell asleep. She tried to wake me up, but trying that when I did opiates is like trying to raise the dead.<br /><br />Shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshit Sorry about the kinda long post in my kinda bad english, guys, but I just had to tell someone about it, and I think you guys could understand how I feel :D <br /><br />Well, at least the trip was nice.<br />Cheers!

				<br /><br />This is about my 4th or maybe 5th post in here. I&#039;m very fucked up this time ! lol<br /><br />Morning was the norm - as you all know.<br /><br />Cup of Espresso, multivitamin with a banana. 1mg Klonopin, 20mg Lexapro, two very big bowl hits of sour diesel.<br /><br />2 Hour Power Nap, calculated for upcoming onslaught.<br /><br />At noon, I proceeded to quickly finish off the bowl of sour diesel which was about 1gram total.<br /><br />I then parachuted 1mg Ativan, 1mg Klonopin, and 10mg dexedrine IR, washed down with lemonade.<br /><br />2 minutes later Opana Hammer Time, 10mg up the right nostril. 10mg up the left.<br /><br />My whole body became 300 feet thick, wrapped in the Opiate Blanket (tm).<br /><br />Smoked 1 bowl of hawaii x laos (LTTM&#039;s hawaiian snow). Super sativa boost.<br /><br />Proceeded to wash the dog and apply conditioner to him while listening to Dark Side Of The Moon.<br /><br />I sweated about two gallons and had to shower myself. I nodded off 5 times in during a 10 minute shower.<br /><br />Outstanding performance!<br /><br />I have not eaten anything since breakfast. Keep that system loaded with the bare essentials.<br /><br />Somehow 3 hours elapsed and my jaw has been hanging off my skull, and I&#039;m tilting my head back to read this <br /><br />screen as I type. I&#039;m in fantastic shape! Maybe I&#039;ll eat dinner when I can walk further than the bathroom.<br /><br />lol<br /><br />Lasagna Seventy Five Pound Brain Swollen With Goodies

				I feel great!<br />100mg Mescaline citrate is equivalent to about 60mg Mesc. HCL<br /><br />I have energy, mental focus, and a feeling of general well-being. Slightly talkative. Colors brightened a bit, but usually only apparent for a brief moment. Mental acuity is definitely improved - feels kinda like oxiracetam with a mood lift.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;ll try about 140mg (equivalent to 85mg HCL).
