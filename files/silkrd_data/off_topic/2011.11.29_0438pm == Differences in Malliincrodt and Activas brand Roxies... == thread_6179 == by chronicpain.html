				I usually get Mallincrodt brand roxies. This month I got the activas (due to the shortage) Well, I just found out that the activas are very very fragile. I have been sending the mallies for months now in a bubblewrap package with other discrete packing methods. Not one issue. Then I&nbsp; just got some feedback saying that 2 of the pills were crushed. I noticed a day or two ago that there is a big difference in pill strength, not for your body,lol..<br /><br />there is less fill in the activas and are a tiny bit smaller. But, when taken nasally, I have found that there is no difference between the two. I know that this is debatable. I literally was able to crush an activa between my two fingers, but the mallincrodt, i have to put my whole weight on it to make it even break.<br /><br />I&nbsp; just thought I would throw this out there to other vendors that had no clue that there was a difference between the two, they look identical. Now, whenever I get activas Im going to switch how I ship them, which sucks, because my method up to know has been flawless,no issues at all. Also, I found that temperature also effects the roxy pills. heat and cold will make them more fragile as well.<br /><br />I wish customers would pm me the info rather than putting it my feedback, I still received a 5/5 but customers, if there is an issue,please communicate with the vendor before saying anything negative. I had to find out by looking at my feedback. I dont mind saying it in the feedback, but hell, tell me directly. <br /><br />I take pride in my packaging, communication, and speed. It really bothers me when there is an issue... But, then again,
