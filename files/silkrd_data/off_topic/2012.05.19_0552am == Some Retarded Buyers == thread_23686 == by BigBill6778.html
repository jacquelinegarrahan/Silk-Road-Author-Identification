				I&#039;m a buyer and I don&#039;t think you should have let this guy get away with this.&nbsp; I am sure he new the exact number of days it takes before you can cancel an order.<br /><br />You should have use the resolution center to get this guy to pay up.&nbsp; If he stayed true to form his next claim would be he didn&#039;t receive the gram so he should get his money back.<br /><br />He is just going to pull the same crap on another vendor. Hell, he had already placed another order. <br /><br />I would have posted his name in the vendor forums to warn them about this guy.

				another thing is I don&#039;t think SR should allow buyers who Bitch to have their orders cancelled should be allowed to leave feed back.<br /><br />Yes I should have gone to resolution but I am still a fairly new vendor &amp; honestly I didn&#039;t KNOW I had the option to do that ( Lesson Learned for sure) <br /><br />So now I have this guy that can effect my Feed Back anytime he wants with the ability to view feed back and change it.<br /><br />I think they should really fix the way they allow FB to be used on cancelled orders (NO FB)

				In future Bill just go straight to resolution. Whilst buyers have escrow to protect them the best way to protect yourself from someone who could be a scammer is by taking it to the admin. Resolution will aid you the most in these situations. <br /><br />Lim

				Yeah, I mean obviously you should try to resolve it and see how it goes with the client first, saves hassle however if you can&#039;t or think you are getting ripped off then just go straight there. Ultimately if you are both prepared to be reasonable then you should be able to settle it, if either the vendor or the client aren&#039;t prepared to come to an agreement generally it&#039;s pretty easy to see through it and the staff are there to oversee that if it&#039;s needed. <br /><br />I&#039;m not commenting on this situation here btw, I dunno what happened and it&#039;s none of my business but it&#039;s just some advice for the future as you are new I believe?<br /><br />Lim
