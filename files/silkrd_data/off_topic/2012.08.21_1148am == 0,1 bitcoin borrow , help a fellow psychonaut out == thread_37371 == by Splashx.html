				You were short 0.26 BTC on an order last month: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32250.msg366272#msg366272<br /><br />Buy a couple more BTC than you need for your transactions in future. Why should others have to fund your habits because you haven&#039;t got the foresight to realise that Bitcoin fluctuates in value and if it goes down you&#039;ll need more to cover the same order?!

				Yes i was short on 0.26 but in the end i didn&#039;t ask that much just 0.02.<br />If you think this will be a habit and if it happens again from now on you can ask me to be banned.<br />I will not ask again for anymore bitcoins , just this one single time.<br />And for the fluctuations it was my mistake and i was short on money and as you can see i don&#039;t have many transactions so i didn&#039;t think this will be a problem.

People asking for others to be banned for doing nothing wrong is not the kind of atmosphere we try to foster here.<br /><br />I&#039;m sorry if I came across as a bit of a dick in my last post, people just need to start buying more BTC than they think they&#039;ll need in order to cover fluctuations in Bitcoin value. There are far too many people coming up short on their orders and asking others to cover what they&#039;re missing.<br /><br />You do seem to have genuinely made a mistake though.<br />I used to help people out when the forums were a lot smaller, and never loan people BTC here anymore, but I&#039;ll help you out this once. Just make sure to get enough to cover your order next time!<br />What&#039;s your name on SR and how much exactly do you need?
