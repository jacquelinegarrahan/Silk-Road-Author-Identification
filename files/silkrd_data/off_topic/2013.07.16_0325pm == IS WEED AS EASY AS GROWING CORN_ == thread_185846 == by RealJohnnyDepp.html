				Weed is pretty easy, Where most 90% of people screw up is in overfeeding.<br /><br />If it&#039;s first time your are growing stick to soil and only use the minimum amount of nutes, <br />After you start getting a feel for it you can experiment more, Then again I learned over years and years and most the lessons I learned at first were hard ones so maybe you have to roll with the punches too.<br /><br />Ahh I dunno what I&#039;m talking about...The plant is easy...Growing awesome weed, now that is a skill that takes practice

Because in fact once it turns amber the THC that was in the trichrome got transformed into CBD or other non psychoactive compounds. Cloudy trichromes is pure THC. Do some reading on the topic. Having amber trichromes just means that those crystals will not get you high. There is not a type of stone that amber trich&#039;s give. There is a lot of debate on this topic, but, has been proven. I am a major member of a marijuana growing forum and have many hydro grows under the belt. That is my specialty. I am sorry that I have to say it like this, but, you keep trying to be the smartest guy on here and the information you just stated is blatantly false.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am well aware that it will have more CBD in the trichome heads.&nbsp; I said couch lock, not stronger. ;)&nbsp; It looks like you need to reread my post or do some research my friend.&nbsp; I have decades of experience growing cannabis.&nbsp; Here is the first few results from google.&nbsp; I&#039;m too busy to find other sources or go past the top of the first page on google.&nbsp; You can do your own research my friend.<br /><br />http://forum.grasscity.com/tokers-qa/1123661-do-amber-clear-trichomes-really-make-much-difference.html<br />https://www.thcfarmer.com/community/threads/trichomes-thc-and-couchlock.30668/<br />http://www.rollitup.org/harvesting-curing/447676-amber-trichomes.html<br />http://www.cannabis-world.org/cw/showthread.php?t=4696&amp;page=2<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The opposite it also true in that if someone wants maximum couch-lock and retain maximum potency they will want fully amber trichomes so it would be pointless to harvest earlier when some or all trichomes were milky white and end up with more of a head high than the person wants. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />[quote70 Percent amber trichomes will give you a good medicinal couchlock[/quote]<br />.
