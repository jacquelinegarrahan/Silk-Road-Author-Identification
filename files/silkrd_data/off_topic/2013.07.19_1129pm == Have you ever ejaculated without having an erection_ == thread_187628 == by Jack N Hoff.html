				Yes but only once. Was high as a kite on Molly and amp and it didn&#039;t want to go up. Feeling ashamed I told the girl to give up but she was determined to get a result. <br /><br />After hours of handjob and BJ something dribbled out, she laughed and I was left feeling even more ashamed and somewhat less of a man.

				It hurt like hell, but I shot across the room, and had to spend four hours cleaning it off the wall.<br /><br />I ended up peeling some of the paint off the wall, it was so thick and caustic.<br /><br />It&#039;s not an experience I want to repeat.

				Ejaculation can and does occur even without climax.<br />Like the post above me said, sometimes the pipes just empty.<br />Then there&#039;s &#039;pre cum&#039; too.. which is ejaculate, just for a different reflex.&nbsp; <br />UTI&#039;s can also cause some pretty nasty coloured and funky scented ejaculate.<br /><br />What I&#039;m really saying is yes, I&#039;m chronically ejaculating without a stiffly.<br />Oh well, you get that on the big jobs..<br />
