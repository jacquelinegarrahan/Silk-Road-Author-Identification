				I didn&#039;t really know what to expect upon joining SR, but I&#039;m growing more glad I did each moment that goes by. What has been created here is refuge. Refuge from unnecessary scrutiny and even sanctuary for those whose government continues to fail them in critical ways, still enforcing laws created by tainted agendas so long ago. How could such a misguided mission be more important than any one person&#039;s life or freedom? <br /><br />I don&#039;t care where the needle of your moral compass may lie. Whether a cop, a DEA agent, or a missionary sent from the big man himself... if someone you loved was dying and our system was failing them and you were told there was a way to procure treatment, you&#039;d take it. No matter what the means. You&#039;d do everything in your power for them because THAT&#039;S who we are.<br /><br />&nbsp;At the core there&#039;s not much different about any of us at all, but somewhere along the way we&#039;ve stopped introspectively calculating what is right and what is wrong and why it is so. It&#039;s an old way of thinking. It&#039;s as outdated as those silly laws and yet it is the backbone of humanity. The thing that&#039;s kept us striving as a species. <br /><br />SR to me, is a compassionate effort to fill this void and ripen the age. It serves as a voice that speaks words louder than what any one person could do.<br /><br />A small list of things that I must do.<br /><br />1.) Make my first orders with MushGoo and GroovyBruce. Why? Because they&#039;re good folks.<br /><br />2.) Experience more.<br /><br />3.) Attain Ibogaine for someone.<br /><br />4.) Help a friend with stage 2 cancer.<br /><br />and 5.) ..Thank the people of this community for making things like this possible.<br /><br />From DPR to moderators, vendors, buyers and the good people I&#039;ve met here so far....<br /><br />Thank you all for continuing to enlighten me and listening to what truly speaks to you.<br /><br />Those are the things that live on when we don&#039;t.<br /><br />Believe that.<br /><br /><br />
