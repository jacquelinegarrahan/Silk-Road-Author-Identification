				So, I&#039;m mostly here because I&#039;m a newb and curious about this deep dark underworld I&#039;d never heard about. I found out about this place on NPR...<br /><br />But anyway, what other webpages would you peeps suggest someone interested in touring the darknet visit to get a flavor?

				I think, or at least I hope, Mr Jim there was just trying to a make a point...&nbsp; But to anyone who&#039;d rather not have their day ruined: don&#039;t click on his link.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; That said, I think that Erystyl was asking for links more along these lines:<br /><br />Portals:<br />&#039;Cleaned&#039; Hidden Wiki: http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion<br /><br />Clandestine Activities BBs:<br />Hacker BB: http://clsvtzwzdgzkjda7.onion/<br />Crime BB: http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion<br /><br />You can also find onion search engines like Torgle.&nbsp; However, from what I understand, the most interesting &#039;deep web&#039; pages aren&#039;t linked to anything, and so one must somehow go about digging for them.

				Most likely child porn, based on his other posts. He talked about rubbing mdma on his dick and fucking a little girl. What a sick piece of shit.

That shit got my blood boiling when I saw it. Nothing pisses me off more than kids being fucked with- drugged, bullied, raped, beaten, kidnapped. Even in a place like this it should be fully off limits.

				The sad part is, I couldn&#039;t tell if he was trolling or not. He might actually be giving a kid mdma and fucking her. Makes me sad tor helps them look at child porn, but my understanding is that if they want to bad enough, they will find a way to.

				Core.onion has served as the simple entry-point to the .onion network since July, 2007.<br /><br />http://eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion/<br /><br />Something interesting is happening with talk.Masked<br /><br />http://ci3hn2uzjw2wby3z.onion/<br /><br />Some kind of an &quot;event&quot;.
