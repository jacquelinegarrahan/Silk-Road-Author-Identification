				I&#039;ve seen postings for Prozac(fluoxetine), Celexa, Sertraline (Zoloft) and other various legal (altho prescription) drugs.<br />Why wouldnt people just order them through a legitimate pharmacy online? I&#039;ve heard of people who cant afford the prices of meds here and ordering prozac thru an online pharmacy and I dont think its illegal since its not a controlled substance (someone correct me if I&#039;m wrong), and thus ordering such substances would not be confiscated and would not get address flagged

				You probably have a better chance of actually getting your prescription drugs on SR than ordering on shady sites on the clearnet. This is because at least there is escrow here.

				People might also not want to have the fact they take SSRI&#039;s or anti-depressants on record seeing as how some government agencies use this against you&nbsp; &nbsp;ie. A new law is passed where anyone who has ever taken an anti-depressant is no longer mentally fit to own a firearm and must turn theirs in if they own any.

				I don&#039;t think any pharmacy site can legally sell prescription meds? Maybe I&#039;m wrong too, but I think those are only available through doctors and prescriptions, so too much of a hassle for some people.

				well.. The sites I have seen to order from still require a script.. <br /><br />Some people dont have insurance and the cost of getting a script can be very high depending on what it is IF you can even get a DR. to write what you want / need.. <br /><br />You add to that issues like not wanting others to know that you are on SSRI&#039;s like DDTICM said.. Like say even Police officers.. Military personnel and people who have security clearances to name a few.. <br /><br /><br />I have a friend that needs Lexapro as his script ran out.. His old Dr died and their records office is a a total war zone. He has tried for over a year to get his records so that another Dr would just write the same script. Well its not that easy.. they cant find it!! He&#039;&#039;s been fighting with a new Dr ( well three this past year) trying to force him on other stuff that is not / has not been working in the mean time racked up about $5000 in medical bills just trying to get his one script for Lexapro .. I can order it from India for $1.20 a pill... for the amount he has spent I could have gotten him 4166 pills already. <br /><br />- Just saying..

				In the US those are only &quot;legal&quot; with a prescription written by a doctor or nurse practitioner under a doctor&#039;s license.

				Quick answer? For convenience I&#039;d say. Prescription drugs can be fun to abuse, and if you want to obtain them legitimately, you have to fake a mental illness, not a very easy or worthwhile thing to do.

				Here&#039;s a tip: they are not legal drugs. You require permission from someone. That is not a good definition of legal. Fishing is illegal, driving is illegal, boating is illegal, prescription drugs are illegal. You can get arrested for doing any of those things without permission. You have no de facto property rights in those cases, and many more. On that note, running a business is illegal, you need permission and you obtain by providing a balance sheet to your countries tax office. Very little is legal, at this rate eventually nothing will be legal.

				Fuck doctors. They are nothing more than medical consultants. On the rare occasion that you need a major (necessary) surgery, then it&#039;s time to go see the doc;--cancer screening, etc...<br /><br />Medical field is one of the most corrupt businesses in America, and most of the world. Fuck your medical degree. If you aren&#039;t volunteering half your time to your patients and public health, then you are part of the problem.<br /><br />Fuck Hospitals. The Boston victims are going to face OUTRAGEOUS financial burdens because where else are they going to go for treatment? Are they going to ask for an estimate before the doctor repairs their arteries, replaces blood, treats shock, run blood panels, etc.? ? ? ? ?<br /><br />Fuck &#039;em all.
