				Letting the child use means you would let the child use a drug that is currently classified as illegal, but doesn&#039;t have to be heroin, it may be any drug, such as weed. It also doesn&#039;t mean you have to let the child use irresponsibly or excessively (your opinion of irresponsible/excessive counts, not the child&#039;s). You also don&#039;t have to let the child start using as soon as it becomes a teenager, it may well be allowed to start at 17, still vote that you&#039;d let it, if you&#039;d let it at 17. <br /><br />I think it is interesting how culture makes certain drugs accepted and others not. I am from Sweden and from the age of 15 I&#039;ve always been offered alcohol at home and it hasn&#039;t been stigmatized at all. I&#039;m wondering if weed was legal, would my parents then offer me a joint instead of a glass of wine after dinner? It would certainly feel strange, but that&#039;s most likely due to culture and may be changed. It would also be a bit strange for me if my parents told me they are taking LSD tonight (I&#039;m not a baby anymore so they don&#039;t have to spend every night watching me). I&#039;m guessing there are a few parents on this forum, so I&#039;m asking you all the question above. Pick your answer (x) and feel free to add an explanation. You don&#039;t have to be a parent to vote, imagination will do.<br /><br />

				Got a 4 year old myself, and my answer would be a cross between (1) and (2).<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t let my kid use before the age of 18, but I wouldn&#039;t tell him I&#039;ve used until he did turn 18. Before he turned 18, I wouldn&#039;t tell him at all Ive used.<br /><br />No particular reason for that. I guess I figure at 18, he&#039;ll be an adult and should know what his dad has done in the past.&nbsp; Before that, he&#039;s still my boy and any image he has of me I&#039;d like to frame in a more positive light.

				I&#039;m a parent. This question is always loaded. If you don&#039;t let your kid know about and do drugs then your a hypocrite. If you do then you&#039;re not a good parent.<br /><br />I think that I would rather be a hypocrite than a bad parent. The fact is that there are many things adults do that kids are not ready for, that&#039;s why they&#039;re called &#039;kids&#039;.&nbsp; Fr&#039;instance I wouldn&#039;t want my child having sex before they&#039;re ready. Kids shouldn&#039;t have to hold a job and pay rent and that&#039;s because they can&#039;t reasonably be expected to be mature and responsible enough to do this and/or go to school. Kids need guidance and security in order to become good people. Once they&#039;ve achieved this, then by all means, go wild, do what you will. BUT realize that it also means that taking responsibility for your actions. If they&#039;ve never learned responsibility then they can&#039;t possibly be expected to know what is alright for them, what their limits are and how to imbibe responsibly.<br /><br />That&#039;s my 2 BtC worth. In summary I would answer #1 on your poll. <br /><br />Good topic for discussion dss3i. There are many opinions here and congratulations to you for being mature enough to want to know more rather than just hop on a bandwagon and have everything laid out in black and white. If you were my kid I might just smoke a spliff with you - if I thought you were ready.&nbsp; ;)

				I think as a parent you have to give your children the best information you can. At whatever age, if they ask you about drugs I&#039;d try to give them as balanced a reply as I could, which would be tailored to suit their age. I would also set out clear boundaries for what I&#039;d expect of their behaviour.<br /><br />I&#039;d be more upset if my child started smoking tobacco (at 16) than if they were smoking weed. Again, I&#039;d try to explain why I feel this way and I would give them reasons based on my own personal experience.<br /><br />I had good friends who&#039;s parents openly smoked weed in front of them from a young age. And, although I wouldn&#039;t do the same (if I still smoked the stuff), I don&#039;t think it harmed them too much.

				This may seem like a strange point of view to some people, but I would prefer to be the first person my child smokes pot with. I started smoking when I was fifteen years old, and I&#039;ll be 30 next summer. I think I could have been a lot more responsible with it if I didn&#039;t have to lie to my parents about smoking pot. Plus I would rather them do it in my house and not have to worry about them getting popped for possession, and the various other negative things that go along with it.&nbsp; Would you rather know that they&#039;re safe or wondering what could happen to them while they&#039;re out sneaking around trying to get high?<br /><br /><br />Of course my kiddo might surprise me and have no interest in smoking which would be fine too. My wife&#039;s parents are lifestyle smokers like myself, and she didn&#039;t really start smoking much until we got together, she was around the age of 22.

				LOLZ. This is hilarious. All four posts above focus on if it is okay for the child to use drugs. My main question is if it is okay for the parent, but there isn&#039;t much discussion about that. The poll shows that so far most of you would or do use drugs as parents, even if they aren&#039;t legal. What about asking the children if they are okay with their parents doing drugs? All children won&#039;t like it. Some might find it scary when their parents become strange. What do you have to say about that?

Those should be kept out of sight and out of mind. But once they start hitting the teenage years, drugs are going to be something they&#039;ll encounter. It&#039;s not a bad parenting to let your kid know you partake. As for letting a child use before they turn 18... that depends fully on the maturity of the child. Non-addictive drugs only, and probably an exclusion for psychedelics as well. Bad parenting is in not educating a child, though. A proper education on how to stay safe is worth far more than a canned education about what to avoid.<br /><br />That&#039;s my view, at least.

				My parents don&#039;t use drugs at all and they never have as far as I know. It would strongly surprise me if they had. When I was 16 I had an impulse and told my mom that I smoke weed sometimes. First she said: &quot;How was it? How does it feel?&quot; Then she told me that she doesn&#039;t like it and that she wants me to stop. I asked her to not tell dad (he wouldn&#039;t take it so well) and she didn&#039;t. She continued to ask me every now and then if I&#039;ve been smoking and I said &quot;no&quot; (didn&#039;t smoke in a few weeks) and then she stopped asking, probably forgot about it all together. Now I&#039;ve started experimenting with some other drugs and I think my mom would really enjoy these drugs. Sometimes I feel the urge to tell her there&#039;s something out there that she might like to try, but it feels a bit awkward talking about these things with my mother. On the other hand she is only going to live once and if I don&#039;t bring her drugs and tell her about drugs nobody else ever will.

				@ 14, if they were determined (as determined as I was to take LSD) I would give them my experience with it, and tell them of the fascinating depth of that drug, warn them of how powerful the effects can be, and encourage them to take their dose at the place where they feel most comfortable with people they trust completely....if they requested that to be @home with me, how could I say no?

The most I can do is let them know they&#039;re always safe, never arrested, and always loved with me.<br /><br />If I caught my hypothetical child about to use some cocaine, I would interfere and stop them.

Addiction steals lives. Any addiction is bad, even a psychological addiction. And in my eyes, addition is like playing russian roulette.

It would be on rare occasions when I have a babysitter or when they are big enough to take care of themselves for a weekend. I don&#039;t think my children would like to do drugs together with me and their dad, but if they asked about it when they are 16+ I would consider it. I&#039;d also have a no drug-policy that&#039;s not up for discussion until they turn 13. When they are 13 I&#039;d probably lay out the facts and ask them to wait until they are 16 before they start experimenting with drugs, but if they wanted to try once or twice for some special occasion (not every weekend) I&#039;d likely be okay with it. When they are 16 I&#039;d be okay with some lighter drugs, but I wouldn&#039;t let them use stronger stuff with my permission until they are 18. Hopefully drug use wouldn&#039;t be much of an issue, because I can&#039;t imagine they&#039;d like to risk their brain development after I tell them how drugs may effect the brain.

If you have a horrible drug experience in the near future it will most definitely affect how you feel your children should approach them. The next time you pass a junkie on the street ask yourself where that persons parents are, did they themselves do drugs, did they talk about it with their kids, if so did it work for the best? The truth is no one has any idea what is the best blanket approach is for all kids. You have to suss out what you think is best for your own child at the time, only you and their dad will know. <br /><br />The best this thread can do is ask what others have done or are doing. I haven&#039;t heard from anyone yet that actually has kids that say they do drugs with their own kids. That should tell you a lot right there. In fact, is there anyone one out there that currently does drugs with their underage children? If so, this is the thread to speak up in.

My parents never tried talking about drugs with me because they never suspected that I was at all interested in drugs and they never noticed me using drugs. Perhaps our children won&#039;t ever express any interest in drugs to us. It could also be that they don&#039;t want to talk about it because they find it embarrassing - sort of like talking about sex - when I got a boyfriend my dad tried discussing sex with me but I said &quot;I already know everything I need to know&quot;, closed the door on him and refused to listen. If that&#039;s the case it&#039;s not easy to talk about it. Whenever my parents asked me about alcohol I simply replied &quot;I don&#039;t want to answer that question&quot; so they weren&#039;t able to have any discussions about alcohol with me either. Then of course at 15-16 that changed, but before that I just wasn&#039;t open to talk about it.

				Had to stpp growing weed when the little ones became aware of more things.<br /><br />Also, we do not smoke in front of the children but when they did come of age we did.<br /><br />You cannot hide drugs from children aged 10,11 and 12. <br /><br />Also we bought a safe to stash whatever we had in case the kids maybe took some to school to show off and we appear in the news or worse, children might be taken into care. Not for cannabis but other drugs parents should not use or use very little of.<br /><br />Alcohol is the worse drug for breaking up families.<br /><br />That is legal.

				I was just looking at the results of the poll. Twenty four votes total and a tie between using yourself although illegal, hiding it from the children and not letting them use (8) VS using yourself although illegal, telling the children, and letting them use (8). I voted for the latter, and the problem I have with the first alternative is that you&#039;re lying to your children if they ask.
