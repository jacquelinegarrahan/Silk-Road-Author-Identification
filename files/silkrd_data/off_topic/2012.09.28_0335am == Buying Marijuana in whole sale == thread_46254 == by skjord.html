				Does anybody know any websites other then BMR and SR that you can buy whole sale (HP, and LB&#039;s) of pot? I&#039;ve seen some listings on here, but most of the vendors require FE, and I&#039;m a bit skeptical about that.

				Just buy it off SR... there are many weed vendors and a large amount of them are high ranked....<br /><br />If you&#039;re a newbie then start slow and build a relationship especially if you dont want to FE!!!!

				I don&#039;t think that buying weed from SR in bulk from is a very viable option. It takes up a large volume that is hard to conceal and because it has such a large volume, vendors would compress it, knocking off trichomes. This is speculation though, maybe someone can chime in and correct me.

				If you get M39 that bud is so dense that compressing it is out if the question... its like trying to compress a rock, not gonna happen.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know where you are located but people send massive amount of weight everyday from this site..<br /><br />Its the place to be.. and BMR is full of shit!! I&#039;d stay away.

				Hey John, what&#039;s the average price per gram of the m39? Would someone pay 50 bucks an eighth for it if it&#039;s grown right? I&#039;m hearing mixed things about the m39 bud. Either it&#039;s a little above average or it&#039;s pretty damn good.
