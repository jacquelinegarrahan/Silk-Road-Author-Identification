				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fxnY_98FNo<br /><br />Fuck you America. I got over the fact you ruined to comedic stylings of Ricky Gervais and knackered Shameless, PeepShow and a lot of other good shit but now you have fucking crossed the line by ripping off The Inbetweeners. Fuck you. <br /><br />Not just fuck you, but fuck all your shitty comedians that aren&#039;t funny like Sarah Fucking Silverman who just doesn&#039;t know when to shut the fuck up and have a voice so nasal she may as well sneeze instead of speak. <br /><br />AND FUCK YOU for your shitty sitcoms that can&#039;t venture out the family setting and FUCK YOU for selling them to British network AND FUCK YOU for CISPA and all the other shit you inflict on the world. <br /><br />I am going away for a while to allow my wounds to heal.<br /><br />FUCK YOU.

				Hey man, the American version of Shameless is fantastic. The office was pretty good for a while but I was never really into either version.<br /><br /><br />But anyways, now that Jim Jefferies crossed over to America you guys have got shit. And no matter how much crap Hollywood may churn out, your people are still and will always be accountable for unleashing the horror that is Russel Brand upon the world. Absolutely unforgivable.

				Yeah you enjoyed it.....but that doesn&#039;t mean there should be one with Americans in it. Can&#039;t we have something that isn&#039;t fucked around with by some cunt who thinks he can do something better when they clearly fucking wont? No. Because everyone must be allowed to tamper with everything even if they should fucking well leave it alone. It&#039;s like those fucks that take films and then digitally remaster them (George Lucus being the Master Cunt when it comes to this) just because they think it&#039;s better but it&#039;s because their balls tingle when they get to tinker with shit that&#039;s perfectly good as it is. Pisses me the fuck off. <br /><br />And I am not even saying American&#039;s shouldn&#039;t enjoy our shit, far from it, I like it when you do and I enjoy your shit but don&#039;t try and do it yourselves because you just balls it up. For example I love Chris Rock, he&#039;s a funny geezer, however I wouldn&#039;t ever recommend people in Britain copy that shit because A. we aren&#039;t American and B. we aren&#039;t black and American, we are black and British. As such we don&#039;t need to take something we can&#039;t do and then look like twats trying to do it. <br /><br />Oh and if you like The American Office please keep it to yourself, it&#039;s ok and you can change with time and help.
