				hey folks,<br /><br />Problem: in a few days I&#039;ve gotta go to the medical examination for military service. Where I live we still have Draft. Don&#039;t wanna do military service, so i need to fail the examination. Is it smart to do a whole shit of several drugs the day before to have a high drug level in your blood and so to increase the possibilty of failing?<br /><br />need advice

				By joining the military your chances of having to use a catheter for the rest of your life increases tenfold. So my advice to you would be to use ANY means necessary to avoid that. I guess drugs are a good choice.

				The trick according to the early acid-heads who needed to dodge the Vietnam draft, was to aim to look/act mentally unfit, and not just &quot;temporarily incapacitated through drugs&quot;...&nbsp; You might need to try a drug/combo you are not experienced with, or even a known &quot;bad combo&quot; so you are genuinely outside your comfort zone and unpredictable...<br /><br />Good luck, beat them at all costs!
