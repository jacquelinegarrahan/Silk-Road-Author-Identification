				Are you planning to repay your loan using your funds that went to Intersango? You see the problem is a little deeper apparently than them not processing withdrawals, their bank account&#039;s been frozen here in the UK.<br /><br />V.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; , <br />I am thinking of trying instacoin , but I am checking out a few other options , so I hope to have funds before they get back up , I&nbsp; was told the 30th they would be back processing .<br /><br />I have paying cash or bank transfer for coins so any suggestions would be cool .<br /><br />I have had one offer , but have sorted anything yet .

				I don&#039;t intend to case a shadow of doubt on the validity of the information you supplied but from an Intersango user&#039;s point of view it seems slightly skewed towards the point of trying to scam.<br /><br />Intersango announced their standing with Metro Bank (in reference to deposits 5 days ago, 4 days before you made this post). BUT this was only announced on the support page, a separate website that needs clicking on for resolution issues, so you could be forgiven for missing this.<br /><br />However, Intersango has extremely &#039;aggresive&#039; deposit polices, so after 6 hours of no deposit you should have gone to the support page, where it was posted on since the 24th.<br /><br />This is my first cause for concern with your post is that , while they have not frozen the account passe, any deposits made after the 24th made were informed that any actions taken are being delayed...and if you made it online you could reverse it.<br /><br />I AM IN NO WAY CALLING YOU A LIAR, I AM SIMPLY A NEW USER WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR POTENTIAL SCAMS DUE TO BEING SCAMMED HIMSELF, SO IS TRYING TO BE CYNICAL WITHOUT TRYING TO SOUND AS LEAST LIKE AN ARSEHOLE AS POSSIBLE.<br /><br />ALSO, I LIKE SHOUTING.

				No offense taken , I read the notice on intersango but complementary forgot about it and made my transfer - also why I let people know I&#039;m now sorted .<br /><br />But you are right to be skeptical though&nbsp; just to be clear - I no longer require anything , I just asked people who know me to honest - this post was a last resort really<br /><br />
