				I wanted to take a vacation abroad in a while and would be interested in taking small amounts of powder form drugs on the plane for personal consumption during the holidays, but of course only if the chance of detection is minimal. Can drugs like say mdma or methamphetamine dissolved for example in a red wine bottle be detected? I thought about dissolving them in small amounts of water first and then injecting the water with the dissolved drugs with a siringe through the cork, so it looks like an unopened bottle of wine, which one could put into the regular suitcase (not handluggage) as an unsuspicious &quot;present&quot;. The amounts I&#039;m talking about are maybe 1 bottle of wine containing 1 g meth and one bottle with 3 g mdma or something like that. Do they have scanners to detect that? Is there a relatively easy way to additionally seal the bottles, so they are airtight? Once at my destination I could simply shake the bottles (I know one shouldn&#039;t do that to red wine, but the wine will probably taste weirdly chemical anyway) and then drink sips of it.<br /><br />In case one was caught one could keep the receipts of the wine bottles and say one bought them at the wine shop that way. Such small amounts wouldn&#039;t look like professional smuggling anyway.<br /><br />This was just an idea i had, but I would be very grateful for any more clever / workable ideas, in case mine is nonsense.

				also may be interested in taking a small amount of powders on holiday with me. I was thinking of putting the said powder in the baggy, then place it between my balls and penis. Anyone tried that before? or i could ram it in a shampoo bottle as said above, but surely the scanners would be able to see this? <br />And what about the risk of sniffer dogs...

				Gt, it depends on the airport and the technology they use. <br /><br />If they have the full body scanners... I&#039;d watch it.<br /><br />Your best bet is honestly rolling the baggie up as small as possible and putting it in your back pocket. Something that small you can&#039;t even feel with a pat down (which are designed to feel for larger items anyway).. It will just feel (if at all) like a bit of lint or tissue. <br /><br />Still I wouldn&#039;t risk it, if you get caught.... Boy is that a rough ride. But you could always claim ignorance if it was in your back pocket. Between your balls? No chance in hell they&#039;d buy that you didnt know it was there
