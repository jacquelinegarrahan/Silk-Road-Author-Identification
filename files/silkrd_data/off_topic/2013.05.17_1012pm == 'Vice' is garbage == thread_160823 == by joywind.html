				&#039;Vice&#039; seems to consist of fags who blend a cutesy-poo man-boy act with lots of naughty swearwords. I have contempt for such people. Men in their 30s and 40s acting like potty-mouthed 13yr olds makes my flesh crawl. Vice is &quot;Jackass&quot; for guys who went to university<br /><br />Vice runs scare pieces on &#039;&#039;the Klan&#039;&#039; these days too - you&#039;ve jumped the shark into middle aged suburban woman territory when &#039;&#039;the Klan&#039;&#039; is this edgy, scary thing. I mean - I&#039;ve gotten my ass kicked by tactical police in front of Rican roach coaches while dope sick. That&#039;s kind of a &#039;&#039;real&#039;&#039; urban experience. How can you be a &#039;&#039;street level&#039;&#039; gonzo reporter like McInnes but think &quot;The Klan&quot; is scary?<br /><br />&quot;Hey guys - some hard street shit here. We&#039;re documenting an *ugh* working class man who said naughty things about gay people.&quot;<br /><br />McInnes and his gonzo team are exposing the seedy and terrible underbelly of urban America -- where things happen like guys make sexist jokes. <br /><br />It&#039;s the same reason I don&#039;t believe Ames ever did heroin. Nobody who does skag talks about it like Ames does -- he watched &#039;&#039;Trainspotting&#039;&#039; then decided to write like some &#039;underground&#039; badass with a jones

				I was about to post a rant about Vice myself, last night. I use to find Vice entertaining every now and then but I&#039;ve much of any respect I had for them over the past few months with their lame and poorly researched &quot;drug&quot; articles.<br /><br />Hamilton aside (who&#039;s work has also went down the shitter), nearly every piece reads like it was written by somebody who&#039;s never actually tried and knows literally nothing about the topic their wrighting on.<br /><br />Take Amphetamine Logic as a prime example of this posing. The author has literally no fucking clue what the hell she is talking about. Buying Amphetamine on street corners in NYC? lol. Yeah, I bet. Good luck finding meth on the street corner in NYC. Good luck finding amphetamine anywhere in the US other than pills.<br /><br /><br />There&#039;s another article from this week that tries to sensationalize the rise of meth use in Greece (apparently because it&#039;s called &quot;sisa&quot;? I&#039;m not sure what the point of the article was or why &quot;sisa&quot; is so fucking mysterious, the &quot;fillers&quot; they point out are not new or unique... just impurities that can be in poorly made meth anywhere).<br />What a piece of shit that was and a lost opportunity to focus on the real problems it&#039;s users are facing. Instead they try to portray it as some mysterious dark drug, attempting to paint the epidemic in the same light as Krokodil.<br />What a fucking joke. I lost all respect for them after reading that piece of shit.<br /><br />Then I look at the author&#039;s other articles to see if his articles are always so poorly researched/uninformed. Yup. The one on bath salts was absolutely riddled more sensational ignorance.<br /><br />According to the author, NBOMEs are dangerous because they are effective in microgram doses unlike the drug it tries to immitate, LSD. Fucking dipshit...<br /><br />Vice&#039;s writers are about as gonzo as Fox News. Whoever runs things should be ashamed and the editors shit-canned.<br />

				I think Joywind needs to get laid/get a life and stop trolling. Nobody gives a shit about your opinions.

				A forum is a place where people meet to exchange mutually no-shits-given opinions.<br /><br />People like Vice because it&#039;s sexy, but it&#039;s poor journalism for sure. I do have kind of a big crush on Slutever&#039;s Karley Sciortino, though.

				Im 10000$ with the OP here.. Its a shame too, because some of their docs cover some interesting material, but the journalist/interviewers are just so fucking bad - they have no clue what they are talking about and almost every one of the crew is a douche bag.

I still seem to learn something every time ive watched but i rarely watch, usually when im done here on the forums ill head over to youtube and fall asleep to one of their docs haha. <br /><br />One thing i credit them with is that they&#039;re pretty unbiased and try to just ask questions.<br /><br />Although, I am not as annoyed with them as much as you are joywind haha.<br /><br />
