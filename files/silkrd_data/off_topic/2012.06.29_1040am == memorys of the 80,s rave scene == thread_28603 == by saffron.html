				as a old fart i remember the late 80,s as the greatest time ,taking my 1st xtc and paying Â£25 for it ,but worth every penny,going to raves meeting weird n wonderfull people ,my life was just one big party ,from club kinetic to the bass place the music was amazing ,donnigton park and bingley hall prob my fav ,as for pills my fav was a black n red capsule called dennis the menace ,trully amazing ,i also enjoyed tripping ,strawberrys,conan,purple ohms ,micro dots ,giving my mrs her 1st trip sitting her down to watch the wall was most entertaining,well i no longer partake in taking anything apart from my green but glad i did as i wouldnt be such a great guy,ha ha ha ha,,would love to hear of other people who enjoyed the early rave scene and who still are enjoying it ,lol,wish i was 15 again,lmao

Far better genres of house beats now IMO. <br /><br />E is dirt cheap these days. That&#039;s a huge improvement.
