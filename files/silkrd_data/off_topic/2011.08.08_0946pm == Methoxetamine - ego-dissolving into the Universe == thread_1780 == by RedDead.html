				I would like to try some Methoxetamine, but I&#039;ve never used a dissociative before. In the listing it says &quot;ego-dissolving into the Universe&quot;. I know about the whole Tibetan Book of the Dead thing with acid, but I never experienced it. What does it feel like?

				This is all for oral/sublingual/insufflated doses, not IV or IM:<br /><br />On a low dose MXE (20-40mg) everything it confusing and you feel &quot;fucked up.&quot; Almost like you keep forgetting something but you don&#039;t remember what it was. You may stumble when trying to walk, very similar to the Soma Shuffle.&nbsp; <br /><br />On a medium dose (40-80mg) you feel pronouncedly more &quot;fucked up.&quot; It is harder to speak in a normal way, you speak slower and people can tell you are messed up. When you close your eyes, you feel like you are sinking down and down into the earth. The confusion increases and thinking patterns are very skewed. Walking is much harder.<br /><br />On higher doses (80-140mg) you start losing touch with reality. It is almost like you exist in a couple realities and keep popping back and forth, especially at 100+ mg dose. Laying down with your eyes closed results in a strong sinking feeling. Depth perception is skewed. Time starts blurring. Your concept of self and everything else starts blurring, which is especially true when you go above 100mg. This is when you get a taste of ego death. Trying to walk will result in stumbling all over the place, very serious loss of balance.<br /><br />At 150+ mg you start completely losing touch with reality. Ego death takes over. You feel like you are sinking into eternity. Time is completely fucked. Be careful as you will do things you don&#039;t remember - that is if you can even move. Trying to walk is damn near impossible, so it is better not to try. Sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />If you have ever taken high dose psychedelics you may understand ego death. It is when your sense of self and everything else doesn&#039;t exist. You are experiencing existence not as &quot;you&quot; but as everything. Words do it no justice, it is simply not something you can explain and capture its true essence. A good way to first experience ego death is with a short lasting psychedelic such as DMT (amazing) or salvia (terrifying.) An ego death dose of MXE would for me be at least 150mg.<br /><br />Everyone reacts differently so before trying even a small dose it is best to take a allergy-test dose (~1mg) first to be safe. Since you have no experience with dissociatives then you really should start small. <br />

				Thanks for the reply. Do I need a scale in order to take it? On Amazon all of the scales start at 1 gram, but I guess I would need something that measures milligrams.

				missit is selling scales on the road for 30$<br /><br /><br />you can also get one on amazon, jewelry scales are what you want. <br /><br />i would just buy the scale from missit on SR, his price is 20 bucks cheaper then the price on amazon :)

				Yeah, well, n alternative would be to buy a scale on ebay, from a chinese vendor. Some of their products can be found on Amazon but 4 times more expensive and it&#039;s exactly the same product. I bought mine for 10 bucks, delivered in ten days.

				my personal description of mxe i think sums it up nicely, its like ketamine with a smile, sort of a warm and happy feeling that comes with the dissociation, i prefer it to ket and its by no means bad stuff and rather than any sort of comedown it has a rather nice afterglow that leaves you feeling great the next day, why i dont know, but i like the day after better than tripping on the stuff. a scale isnt really essential if you can control yourself and do small lines to build to where you want to be, but its generally better to measure it as with all dosages<br /><br />if you havent taken a dissociative before then there are 2 stages, a mild dose will get you all wobbly, somewhat like being a stranger in your own body, it doesnt seem to control the same way. but up the dose and youll be off to another world entirely

One thing you must be careful with is redosing. Be sure to wait that a dose has totally kicked in (~45 mins) before taking more.

				Sounds like something I want to try. Does anyone know if it is safe to take with SSRIS and benzos?

				im pretty sure its not seretonergic so the ssris shouldnt cause a problem, the only issue i can see is that it is another cns depressant so not ideal to be mixing with benzos, that said so long as you dont go crazy on either you should be fine, but dont take my word for it 100% im no doctor and youre still dealing with a research chemical that has little known about it
