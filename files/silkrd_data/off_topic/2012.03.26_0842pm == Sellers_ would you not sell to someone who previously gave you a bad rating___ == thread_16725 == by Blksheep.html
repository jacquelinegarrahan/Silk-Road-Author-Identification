				I thought of this while stoned on Trustus Jones: Strawberry Vanilla Kush... damn good bud!<br /><br />So if you are a seller would you admit to not selling to someone after they gave you a previous bad review...?<br /><br />I could certainly understand if you did put complainers on a ban list... like someone who complains the bag was short... and he has shitty scales and you always weigh each bag with micro-scales and even add a little to make sure the customer is happy...<br /><br />or the guy who was expecting the package in two days and instead gets it in three and even though there is no way in hell it is your fault the A-hole leaves a 4/5 or god forbid a 3/5!<br /><br />Time for another hit...<br /><br />

				first you have to consider whether the buyer is likely to leave negative feedback again. Second, you must determine if that likelihood multiplied by the mean number of people who will be turned off by one marginal poor feedback is worth the profit (minus risk) in selling this individual your product.
