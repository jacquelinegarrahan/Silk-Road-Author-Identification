				Look, your just going to have to take the risk for yourself.<br />Giving the user name of your exchange can have serious implications, not only will it narrow down your location, which may not bother you but your exposing them without there knowledge,&nbsp; (security is a two way thing), it will also compromise the seller who may not want to be associated with silk road, although it is not illegal to sell coins, providing finance for illegal means is a VERY serious offense, taken very seriously by SOCA, HMRC, IR, all of which are able to bring individual investigations and charges, but you know this because you have done your research.<br /><br />Point to note, i have seen at least one uk coin seller approach you about offering you the exact service you require, i suggest that instead of blabbing names over the forum you pm him and discuss the set up and make a deal, start small until you feel comfortable.<br /><br />Just because this is on an anonymous web site don&#039;t ever think your invisible, complacency gets you caught and drags down any others you have been stupid enough to mention.<br /><br />

				Maybe not location specifically but it can be pinpointed to one person, have you asked this man if its ok to advertise his name on this forum, to ask if hes ok to exchange money with to buy illegal substances? There are clearnet forums you can do this without arousing suspicion or shining a spotlight onto someone. <br />I think you miss the point i&#039;m trying to make, but i will wish you well in your search. <br />
