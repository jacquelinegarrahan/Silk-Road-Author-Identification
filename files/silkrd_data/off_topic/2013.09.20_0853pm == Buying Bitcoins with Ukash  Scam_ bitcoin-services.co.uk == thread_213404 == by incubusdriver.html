				Just a quick note to help folk learn from my mistake, do not use this website.<br /><br />It&#039;s been going for about a year now, and I&#039;ve seen 2 posts asking about its legitimacy here on SR forums from several months ago... well, I was stupid enough to lose a bit of cash on there trying to buy Bitcoins with Ukash.<br /><br />Luckily, I was wary and didn&#039;t try buying everything there - just a bit. But it&#039;s a scam website, don&#039;t use it.<br /><br />European folk looking to buy Bitcoins with Ukash, the best and most reliable I&#039;ve found is bitbargain.co.uk
