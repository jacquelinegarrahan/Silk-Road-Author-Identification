				The c10 products are custom pressed benzos, the 10mg Diaz were much stronger than the typical msj blues. They are now doing 20mg Valium which are very strong. I also tried 30mg temazepam which should be a whacking great dose, I didn&#039;t rate them that much, plus they dyed my mouth blue leading to an awkward conversation with my partner !

				Yeah&nbsp; I would agree with that. The 10mg Valium were really strong but I&#039;ve been a bit dissapointed with the more recent offerings. I&#039;d say the 20mg are stronger than 10s but I don&#039;t know about twice as strong. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately there arent many UK benzo vendors at the moment, particularly for smaller amounts.

				If your looking for 10mg valium Black Tuna Gang is back up and running.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/ec34f98ce8<br /><br />They were one of the more popular vendors a few months back but had to take an extended break due to some family/personal issues.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a benzo expert but I did enjoy their blues a lot. They are generic but not the msj blues from what I understand.

				Yeah black tuna used to do good quality blues. Good to see them back. I&#039;m still sort of on the fence about these 20mg C10 Valium, there strong but I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;re twice as strong?&nbsp;

				I always find it quite difficult to judge strength with benzos as tolerance goes up so quickly. Less is definitely more.&nbsp; I try and not start necking two or three at once as I&#039;ve learnt from bitter experience in younger days you end up taking 10 at once going &#039;why aren&#039;t they working ? These are shit! Has anyone seen my keys? What have we been doing the last week?&#039;<br />Nowadays I&#039;ll have one of an evening maybe two if its my birthday.

When i first started taking Xanax i would drop 4 or more Of the 2mg bars and ATM tell people i wasnt feeling shit and end up doing more, The next day i cant find my wallet, The car is parked half way down the road from my actual house and Left over sweets and food from the night before. For some reason i use to always wanna start cleaning up too. <br /><br />Now a days A bar maybe 2 AT MOST! and im good to go! Anything over an i just see it as a waste to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was just speaking to someone about the C10 labs and their products. I heard about the 20mg Vals an first thing that came to my mind was just FAKE MEDS Or very weak and poorly made. Im not sure where they company(s) are actually at. I&#039;m from the US so Benzo&#039;s really isnt a issue IRL or SR vendors. <br /><br />Have you tried the Xanax Candys people are making these days? I got some XANAX and DORMICUM &lt;(May have spelt wrong)&nbsp; Mints for Christmas Last year, I was suprised How good both were! I&#039;m waiting on some 3mg Xanax Candies as we speak.

				I&#039;ve bought the 20mg C10 valiums&nbsp; twice now. They&#039;re perfect for me as I usually end up taking two 10mg MSJ blues anyway.<br /><br />Not sure if they&#039;re exactly 20mg, but they&#039;re definitely strong enough and do the trick to bring me down at the end of a trip into a nice long deep sleep. I can also usually still feel it for the whole next day too, which is great!<br /><br />Overall excellent value for money + highly recommended :)

				They are definitely good strong benzos, I wouldnt buy the 30 mg temazempam again as there was something going on with the dye in them that made my mouth blue, but the 10 and 20 mg Valium are good quality. I mean they are fake as in they are not made by Roche or something but they are decent quality. For a while they were definitely the best available UK to UK. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;msj blues are kind of weak but its like the devil you know sometimes....they are a known standard, I&#039;ve happily bought them on many occaisions. But the C10 10mg were loads stronger. I&#039;m just not sure the twenty are twice as strong.
