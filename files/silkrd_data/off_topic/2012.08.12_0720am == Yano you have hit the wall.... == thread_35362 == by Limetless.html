				Yano you are quite close to rock bottom when you can&#039;t count eight pounds out in your hand and then your hand then oddly reminds you of a claw. Meh! Fail.

				Shit yeah it&#039;s a potent drug alrite!!!! It has had me lose the plot a couple of times to be fair, but I do like the buzz and how varying amounts have different effects on you, just for a nice little sociable, chatty pick me up, or to trip balls wobbling all over the shop, all within a 100mg range. I&#039;ve lost all sense of identity, space &amp; time while on a heavy K hole bender at a party!!! Not the best setting for it but hey!! ;) It was still fun!!! You just have to be head strong &amp; have some weight/fat on your body to be able to take a bigish dose of K without going toooo wonky.....It&#039;s a most enjoyable compliment to other drugs such as MDMA &amp; 2C-B.

				You really shouldn&#039;t go out when doing K. Well in my experience ;D I have tired it once and it freaked me out. I couldn&#039;t stand up and I must&#039;ve looked like a right mong because I couldn&#039;t see much but a load of blurry colours and some orange streetlights. Maybe I took too much for my first time.

Some of my mates thought it&#039;d be good to get in this river (I think we wanted to get to the other side?). They kept saying how good being in the water felt. So if you can picture the scene, it&#039;s early in the morning, the suns just coming up and three young guys gerning their faces off are wading waist deep along a river... when along comes a dog walker. My mate goes &quot;Just act normal&quot; ::)

				Makes me feel like a robot... in a good way.<br /><br />The most fucked I&#039;ve ever seem anyone was on K. He not only lost the ability to walk, or move in any normal way. He lost the ability to speak English! When I looked in his eyes there was no recognition, he was just staring through me, lost. He seemed to be enjoying it, he smiled the whole time. ???

				Enjoy it Gary, but be warned, theres a fine line with K, TOO MUCH KETAMINE is an often said phrase in the UK.<br />The last K-victim i recall seeing thought he was a post, propping up a tent. he obviously wasn&#039;t, we were at an festival and this guy was just stuck, rigid, being bounced between his friends. he was smiling though.<br /><br />sometimes its called Regretamine.

				I&#039;m pretty easygoing with drugs, way more so than the rest of you lot from the things I&#039;ve read. I may have a history of experience, but it&#039;s all pretty tame. A trait synonymous with psychedelics I suppose. Anyways, I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll love it but I&#039;ve preferred small doses with MXE and intend to stay the same with Ketamine, odds are I&#039;ll never exceed 100mg in a day so no worries. I have no intention of becoming a zombie. ;)
