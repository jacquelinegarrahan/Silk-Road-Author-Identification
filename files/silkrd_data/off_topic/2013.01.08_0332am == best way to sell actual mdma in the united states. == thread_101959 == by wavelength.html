				I mostly just sell to my friends now but sometimes im curious how some people make money off of pills.&nbsp; Since some pills for example partyflocks cost around 9-10 dollars a piece do you charge 20 or 30 a piece in the states.&nbsp; I find buying molly and selling caps means more money for me in the end.&nbsp; I can see major profit if you buy bulk if you can afford it like supertrips 100xGreen Question marks for $4.60 a piece and sell each for $15 or $20 a pop.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the game and like the OP i want to spread the love of real mdma not pipes or methylone instead but wouldnt mind expanding and spreading said product in my area.&nbsp; Most events i go to im said only dealer there and run out of product pretty quickly but was just wondering on whats a fair deal to myself and my customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;$10 a point or let my product speak for itself and give a few freebies away like some professional vendors here do.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				I live on the west coast of the US and for the past five months have been buying pressed pills from SR and selling them locally.&nbsp; It&#039;s been real hit and miss.&nbsp; Guys like BeansUSA and BrPower have delivered but then I&#039;d turn around and get burned by F16 or CookieClub and suddenly ... all the profits that I&#039;ve earned are gone.&nbsp; Why not just fid one reliable vender and stick with him?&nbsp; Wish I could.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have success buying 150 partyflocks from BrPower but when I return a few weeks later to buy more he&#039;s sold out and has no listings avail.&nbsp; So then I&#039;ll buy from BeansUSA and a few weeks later... same result.&nbsp; He&#039;s shut down.&nbsp; Which then forces me to have to try yet another vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m sorry, but the shipping time will absolutely impact you if you&#039;re trying to get a legitimate business going.&nbsp; After spending six weeks getting the word out that you&#039;ve got product, you finally start getting the phone to ring consistently only to have to tell them &quot;Sorry.&nbsp; Sold out.&nbsp; When&#039;s my next shipment?&nbsp; I dunno...could be tomorrow... could be thirty days from now.&quot;.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t exactly inspire confidence in your customers.<br /><br />I wish to God I could find someone local, someone in the Los Angeles area that I could do business with.&nbsp; But as you&#039;ve surmised... the local people want you to pay $12 to $15 for a pill... even when you&#039;re ordering bulk.&nbsp; And there&#039;s simply no room for profit with that kind of arrangement.

				yeeah .. it&nbsp; seems like there is actually quite a bit of an opportunity in most places in the US to make a significant profit, assuming you are able to find a reliable vendor with quality product. I don&#039;t even know if I could find molly locally and pressed pills are usually 50/50 methylone and still expensive as shit (~20 to 25 a pill). The only thing I would be worried about is stepping on the toes of local distribution networks. The weed market has generally been taken over by local home growers producing quality herb (also by MMJ distributors), but im pretty sure that MDMA production as well as the higher level distribution is still cornered by organized crime (gangs, cartels, etc). I could be way off base on this as this is really just speculation on my part, but I would make sure you have your ass covered with regard to safety precautions. If you start moving a significant quantity of high quality, cheap MDMA, you&#039;re going to take a significant share of the market in your area and are muuuch more likely to pop up on SOMEONES radar.

				&nbsp;I&#039;m in a smaller community. Not too many people have even heard of Molly (pure mdma), they assume it&#039;s the ecstasy of the 90s. Cocaine is prevelant. <br /><br />After xmas I ordered 5gs MDMA from Evilution. It is *suppossed* to arrive in the next 10 days. I&#039;m throwing myself a bday party and renting a party bus with music (dance, old skooool rap, whomp whomp), crazy lights, a stripper pole, etc. My plan is to gift out the 5gs to friends (and friends of friends) and show everyone a really fucking good time. Hopefully it will be a good business investment.<br /><br />I also plan on approaching one of the bigger fraternities at the university near me to see if they need a good supplier. I&#039;m convinced all they do is blow around here and I&#039;m going to try to spread the Molly love bc I believe it&#039;s SO MUCH better than coke.<br />

				Honestly man, if you&#039;re not worried about shipping time, go with DutchAanbod.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; 10g-90g at $18.3/g.&nbsp; Keep in mind that you&#039;ll be paying ~$20 for shipping and it&#039;ll probably take 3/4 weeks because he&#039;s gotta smuggle it into germany before it ships. But you CAN&#039;T beat his prices.&nbsp; <br /><br />Otherwise use SuperTrips.&nbsp; He&#039;ll sell you 10g for $300 free shipping and 7-12 business days for delivery to US.&nbsp; I DO personally prefer DA&#039;s Molly, but ST&#039;s is still VERY good and better than anything else in the area by easily 30%.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, n1ll0 is correct about shipping times affecting your business because once you get people hitting you up for product, you don&#039;t wanna turn them down because it&#039;ll take that much more effort for you to convince them to try your services again.&nbsp; Seriously, for me it&#039;s always taken FOREVER to get people to start hitting me up(even with generous free samples) and they only start calling me when I&#039;m out! :/&nbsp; It sucks but it&#039;s SO true!

You very well may be right about the situation in your town, especially if you are in a smaller town with only local drug dealers then I can definitely see this being the case. However the following logical assumptions kept sticking in my mind when going over the situation:<br /><br />1. A report (CLEARNET PDF LINK - sorry I wasn&#039;t able to upload it to scribd, but you might be able to preview it through google search cache if you search for &quot;United States MDMA Trafficking&quot; - www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Joint%20Assessment%20of%20MDMA%20Trafficking%20Trends.pdf) sponsored by the National Drug Intelligence Center, DEA, and ICE found that the majority of MDMA is smuggled into the US by Israeli and Russian Organized crime (granted this report was from 2000 and the DEA have made a couple huge MDMA seizures in the intervening time, but the situation is likely very similar, if not the same)<br /><br />2. Aforementioned crime organizations expend significant effort and resources to smuggle and distribute MDMA in the united states, and based off of the significant quantities&nbsp; of the drug that have been confiscated by the DEA and Customs Enforcement, the US MDMA market is a signficant source of revenue to renew their resources.<br /><br />3. Depending on where you enter the distribution chain and the quantities you are slinging, if a intermediate wholesale or local buyer begins sourcing a large amount of product from you instead of their normal source (from above, likely an organized crime network), you are definitely going to be taking a significant cut of revenue from these networks.<br /><br />4. In order to protect their revenue source and future viability as large scale drug distribution networks, said organizations could (and in my imagining likely WOULD) investigate the new source (you) and retaliate.<br /><br />Again, speculation on my part, but I believe logical speculation. Also, as mentioned above, there are a number of contributing factors that might make it significantly less likely to be noticed, ie. not selling huge quantities, selling only to local dealers and not intermediate wholesale providers, your specific locale (eg midwest or mountain area are further away from sea-based metropolitan import areas, ie large import and distribution nodes for international crime organizations, so would be further down the distribution chain from the organized crime networks).

				I don&#039;t really understand what you mean? <br /><br />It&#039;s fairly straight forward:<br /><br />1. Acquire MDMA at a fair price on the road <br /><br />2. Wait for MDMA to be in your possesion<br /><br />3. Do all your profit/loss margin work to find the price you need to sell at&nbsp; to make the amount you would like.<br /><br />4.

I don&#039;t even know if I could find molly locally and pressed pills are usually 50/50 methylone and still expensive as shit (~20 to 25 a pill). The only thing I would be worried about is stepping on the toes of local distribution networks. The weed market has generally been taken over by local home growers producing quality herb (also by MMJ distributors), but im pretty sure that MDMA production as well as the higher level distribution is still cornered by organized crime (gangs, cartels, etc). I could be way off base on this as this is really just speculation on my part, but I would make sure you have your ass covered with regard to safety precautions. If you start moving a significant quantity of high quality, cheap MDMA, you&#039;re going to take a significant share of the market in your area and are muuuch more likely to pop up on SOMEONES radar.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />only if you&#039;re a moron and dont know how to sell drugs honestly. this is REAL LIFE not some show you saw on TV.

Buy a burner cell that you contact your second level distributors at(you are the first level). Every time a deal goes down, TOSS IT. Never keep product in or near your home. Store it at a &quot;friend&#039;s&quot;(someone if they get busted, you won&#039;t give two shits about, and who doesn&#039;t know your real name.), or find a secure location to store it. You want it somewhere that if it&#039;s busted, you won&#039;t be there when it is, and if you show up and it has been, it&#039;s obvious that something is wrong/has changed.<br /><br />I&#039;d say set up a fake business, something that can remove personal liability. Remember what everyone on Silk Road tells you, NEVER say a word to the cops. the first thing that should come out of your mouth when you see one(besides if you get pulled over for a ticket) is&quot; Am i under arrest, if not am i free to leave?&quot;&nbsp; The next words out of your mouth if a cop arrests you is &quot;I want a lawyer and exercise my 5th amendment right against self incrimination&quot;. THEN YOU SAY NOTHING until your lawyer arrives. Anything you say to the cops can be used against you, never for you.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: dbz4u</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now as for the selling, do the same thing. Sell in bulk. Put a fucking layer or two of abstraction between you and the guy selling on the street. You literally want to become the Walter White of MDMA from Season 5 of breaking bad. Sell in Bulk, you are a distributor not a dealer. The more transactions you handle, the more possibilities that one goes wrong and you get taken down. You sell in minimum 10g quantities to your dealers. They don&#039;t sell directly to anyone, they distribute this again to another set of people. At this point, those people are the actual dealers on the street. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bingo.&nbsp; I started off selling individuals and if your product is consistently good then word of mouth will spread.&nbsp; Each group of people who wants molly will naturally (you might need to direct them) to send one &quot;delegate&quot; to you who buys for the entire group.&nbsp; Make sure this delegate is someone that you trust, and this way your transactions are in bulk and you have less points of contact.<br /><br />It helps to be patient.&nbsp; Even if pills sell for cheap where you are, word of mouth will eventually have people coming to you.&nbsp; A lot of MDMA users don&#039;t want to have to worry about whether their pills will work when they&#039;ve already paid for them and consumed them.&nbsp; Peace of mind has financial value.<br /><br />Other than that, don&#039;t look or act like a common criminal.&nbsp; Be polite to people and dress relatively well so that you don&#039;t &quot;look the part&quot;.&nbsp; As for people only rolling once a month... it depends where you live.&nbsp; Where I am (relatively large city with decent club scene) people are dumb enough to dose one night then again the next night.&nbsp; I personally think they&#039;re idiots but I&#039;m also laughing all the way to the bank =P

				mdma is easy to sell.&nbsp; The market&#039;s there, you just have to find it and get sr quality into people&#039;s hands.&nbsp; Sponsor a small party.&nbsp; Throw out a few free grams throughout the night, and I guarantee everyone will want your number.<br /><br />My problem in my area was turn-around time.&nbsp; I could sell whatever quantity I bought from overseas and it&#039;d be gone in a couple days, but then I&#039;d have to wait another month for another shipment.&nbsp; Depending on the baller-status of your lifestyle, all that profit could be gone by then.<br /><br />As mentioned, LL from Canada&#039;s solid, as well many overseas vendors, if you still want to go the mdma route.

The thing is, the people that are good enough to make it in the game aren&#039;t in the game because theyre usually smart enough to do something else.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Precisely. Neither you nor anyone you know should be doing actual transactions like i said before. You are a distributor not a dealer, not a carter leader. You move product in bulk and that&#039;s IT. That is the smartest way to stay away from trouble. If you can make a deal for 10k, 20k from a 100 gram order from here, that is how you should do it. Not selling individual grams, that&#039;s how morons do it

				I think to be safe only do the largest bulk quantities you can.&nbsp; Sure you may be able to make $80 to $100 profit off a single gram if selling in individual doses, but would that be worth the added risk of dealing with +10 times more people?

				Hey OP. Its not that the US has bogus MDMA going around, not on the east coast anyway.

Which in many instances&nbsp; makes for an awesome roll, whenn there is infact a sizable dose of real MDMA in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;My suggestion would be to buy from w.e vendor you feel comfy with, domestic or not, and just cap up pure MDMA, do like 120-160 mg caps. Throw the first few out for free, to people that know their shit, and have money. You will not lose. Now you may not make your $ 30 times over like others have said and try to do, but I assure you, your business will boom.. No one caps up PURE MDMA on the street. So you do it, and you will corner your local Mandy market. <br /><br />Shit i just capped up 20 for short sale, 110mg MDMA(cousinfrank)+10mg Meth(hammertime)+20mg K(cousinfrank). My locals love it.

I&#039;ve never been to an event, but I&#039;m told people pretty much sell drugs openly inside the gates, some people go there for the main purpose of buying molly.

He sells cut shit but they were lite off my molle. So now they are ordering quater kilos of methylone and mdma off me through this site.

I can test and know what I&#039;m getting.<br /><br />Try out that method.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101959.msg710762#msg710762">Quote from: heliotap on January 08, 2013, 05:09 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I mostly just sell to my friends now but sometimes im curious how some people make money off of pills.&nbsp; Since some pills for example partyflocks cost around 9-10 dollars a piece do you charge 20 or 30 a piece in the states.&nbsp; I find buying molly and selling caps means more money for me in the end.&nbsp; I can see major profit if you buy bulk if you can afford it like supertrips 100xGreen Question marks for $4.60 a piece and sell each for $15 or $20 a pop.&nbsp; I&#039;m new to the game and like the OP i want to spread the love of real mdma not pipes or methylone instead but wouldnt mind expanding and spreading said product in my area.&nbsp; Most events i go to im said only dealer there and run out of product pretty quickly but was just wondering on whats a fair deal to myself and my customers.&nbsp; &nbsp;$10 a point or let my product speak for itself and give a few freebies away like some professional vendors here do. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I suggest gunning for real MDMA OR get your pills out for $20 a pop. That&#039;s what they go for, mostly. Getting for $10 MAX, flip &#039;em for $20. Hell, good volume, and they can go for $15. That&#039;s what they go for, they can take it or leave it. Trust me, if it&#039;s good (and it is), then they&#039;re taking it, and they&#039;re telling their friends to take it, and before you know it, you can&#039;t stop them from calling.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101959.msg711011#msg711011">Quote from: captainfun on January 08, 2013, 08:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I live on the west coast of the US and for the past five months have been buying pressed pills from SR and selling them locally.&nbsp; It&#039;s been real hit and miss.&nbsp; Guys like BeansUSA and BrPower have delivered but then I&#039;d turn around and get burned by F16 or CookieClub and suddenly ... all the profits that I&#039;ve earned are gone.&nbsp; Why not just fid one reliable vender and stick with him?&nbsp; Wish I could.&nbsp; I&#039;ll have success buying 150 partyflocks from BrPower but when I return a few weeks later to buy more he&#039;s sold out and has no listings avail.&nbsp; So then I&#039;ll buy from BeansUSA and a few weeks later... same result.&nbsp; He&#039;s shut down.&nbsp; Which then forces me to have to try yet another vendor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, I&#039;m sorry, but the shipping time will absolutely impact you if you&#039;re trying to get a legitimate business going.&nbsp; After spending six weeks getting the word out that you&#039;ve got product, you finally start getting the phone to ring consistently only to have to tell them &quot;Sorry.&nbsp; Sold out.&nbsp; When&#039;s my next shipment?&nbsp; I dunno...could be tomorrow... could be thirty days from now.&quot;.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t exactly inspire confidence in your customers.<br /><br />I wish to God I could find someone local, someone in the Los Angeles area that I could do business with.&nbsp; But as you&#039;ve surmised... the local people want you to pay $12 to $15 for a pill... even when you&#039;re ordering bulk.&nbsp; And there&#039;s simply no room for profit with that kind of arrangement.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You summed up my life on here, with the crystals, perfectly. Shipping time from overseas is CRITICAL. It can MAKE or BREAK your business. The good thing is, though, more domestic vendors are carrying pills and crystals for domestic distribution.

I don&#039;t even know if I could find molly locally and pressed pills are usually 50/50 methylone and still expensive as shit (~20 to 25 a pill). The only thing I would be worried about is stepping on the toes of local distribution networks. The weed market has generally been taken over by local home growers producing quality herb (also by MMJ distributors), but im pretty sure that MDMA production as well as the higher level distribution is still cornered by organized crime (gangs, cartels, etc). I could be way off base on this as this is really just speculation on my part, but I would make sure you have your ass covered with regard to safety precautions. If you start moving a significant quantity of high quality, cheap MDMA, you&#039;re going to take a significant share of the market in your area and are muuuch more likely to pop up on SOMEONES radar.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;;DTrust me, I am laughing with you! Look, it&#039;s speculation. You have to be making &quot;quite&quot; a bit of spare change for organized cartels to come after you for stepping son someone&#039;s feet. Trust me, I worked/partied during one of the highest known crime syndicates in modern history, and everyone I rolled with got a chance to eat. You have to making millions, from what I have experienced and observed, for anyone to even remotely approach you. Put it to you this way, I&#039;ve seen guys make $10 to $12 grand in any given month, visible to competition, and never get touched. Hell, if you are smart, you will follow up with and approach anyone who &quot;see&#039;s&quot; what you are doing and build an alliance with them. You mean to tell me their connect is better than The Road? One thing I love about The Road, is that it has turned the paradigm of vending and distributing on it&#039;s ear. Guys that are just used to being street, no longer going to be able to compete.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101959.msg711606#msg711606">Quote from: Lubriderm on January 08, 2013, 04:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The MDMA vendors here are great but the problem is that i have no customer base for molly, it sucks...

Oxycodone seems to have replaced ecstasy pills, but for every free dose of molly I&#039;ve given out, the person has become amazed by the drug and eager to experience MDMA again. <br /><br />From what people have been telling me Music Festivals is the method to unload a large amount of molly. I&#039;ve never been to an event, but I&#039;m told people pretty much sell drugs openly inside the gates, some people go there for the main purpose of buying molly.

Like i mentioned with the K , meth and 2c-b.<br /><br />&nbsp;For example, 1 gram of mdma, 200mg meth and 200mg of K. Will net you 10 caps @140mg each. Thats 100mg mdma,20mg meth and 20mg K per roll. Make all the proper measurements, and put it all in one bag. Be sure to spend enough time mixing it all together good.&nbsp; Be very diligent. You want that mix as consistent as possible, so be sure to crush and dust all that shit together and shake it up real good.<br /><br />&nbsp;Then I like to use a drinking straw, that you cut on a 45* angle, to scoop from the bag to the cap. A typical fast food chain drinking straw should fit perfectly in a size 0 cap. Mine happened to be from TacoHell. Then throw your cap on the scale, tare the .1 that the cap weighs, and the rest is self explanatory.<br /><br />&nbsp;Now im sure there is other things you can do to make this more efficient. Such as some how fucking with the straw , enabling it to have a max capacity of your exact measurement needed. Then if that can be done, you can get or make some sort of tray to set all the opened caps in individual little sleeves to speed the process up and be able to get more done in less time. <br /><br />&nbsp;Hope that helped dude, good luck. Much love&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I tried the straw method and lucky that i used a clear straw, because that method is totally inefficient. It gets stuck on the inside of the straw, you&#039;re actually losing molly if you do it that way :(. I can&#039;t really think of anything more creative, i obviously want some sort of funnel which the powder won&#039;t stick too. The question is what to use that fits a size 0 cap

				Hmmm so the&nbsp; way you guys do it is get 5-10 g&#039;s, get your customer base, then cap up 120mg per cap, then just sell @20-25 a roll? Then keep profit, rinse, repeat? <br />Who is the cheapest/quality/stealthiest/fastest vendor? Opinions? I know this isn&#039;t a easy 1 answer. Preferred USA domestic but if cheap enough then non domestic is fine. I have 25 Hearts coming from XTCEXRESS currently...

He is nice, however he does a few annoying things. 1. He always has an annoying header in his messages(in the actual message body), that by the 4th time you message him it almost feels a tinge patronizing, and he only responds with 1-2 sentences pretty much always. However, i had no other issues, shipping time was as expected for int. shipping(i guess, I&#039;m just an anxious fuck). Packaging was good, nice tan color. He went .1 over. He&#039;s the only main bulk dealer(aside from JOR i think, correct me if I&#039;m wrong), that never has FE EVER., with 10g prices under 400

				lol well because my thread got brought back to life i guess ill say the best advice i have on capping things out.<br /><br />i got some of ilfs mda and sold that and it went VERY fast, even though i was doing 20 a tenth/15 for my friends.<br /><br />as far as capping went, i just weighed out one tenth, got a good idea of what it looked like, and put it in a capsule so i could see how full it was.<br /><br />after that, i capped out the other 30 or so all by eye, making sure that they all had about what they should have (give or take the slightest bit, didnt matter. everyone that took it got faced of one cap regardless of how full it was)<br /><br />i did it by just emptying out the pile of mda, and just scooping up the mda into the cap and checking to make sure there was enough.<br /><br />of course as a customer i would rather people weigh each tenth but like i said, noone had anything even remotely negative to say about it.<br />it was probably the most legit shit most of them had EVER taken lol.<br /><br />but yeah with my first test run on selling molly here in the us, shit is a cake walk.<br /><br />let a few &quot;experienced&quot; people try it, and everyone else will listen to them when they talk about how legit it is.(every drug dealer will say they have &quot;the best ever&quot; ,you need someone who isnt a part of the operation to vouch for your product)<br /><br />even at the prices i had, it started out very slow until a few people gave it a whirl, once that happened it was gone before i could blink an eye...&nbsp; ;)

				Yes, but they are kind of wide at the end there. I still say the best bet is to get a mcdondalds or tacobell straw cut off a 3 inch peice, then cut on end at a 25 degree angle. It works perfectly. Just like when you dip the straw into soda and cover the top end with your finger to create suction and hold the liquid in, the same applies to the mdma. Poke it down into your crushed up mdxx mix, then slide the end into the top of the cap and give a few good taps on the top end to clear all the mandy out and into the cap.

				For capping, I just throw things on a piece of paper, folded twice so both creases form a cross in the middle of the sheet. Then I use a mini measuring spoon, that you can find on Ebay or Amazon, to scoop up to around the desired amount and place it on the scale. From that point I just use the tweezers which came with the scale to get up to the exact amounts I&#039;d like. After that I simply take the substance and scrape it into a mini funnel which is placed on top of the cap. The funnel can also be had from Ebay or Amazon, and should have a very short stem. The stem should also be just a few mm in diameter. For instance in the case of size 1 caps, the stem should be 5 mm or less. Tap/shake it a little, and use the tweezers to push anything residual through. After that it&#039;s just rinse and repeat. If the substance on the piece of paper starts to spread due to repeated scoops from the measuring spoon, simply utilize the cross formed by the 2 creases to lift the edges of the paper up and consolidate things back into the middle of the sheet. Not too hard.

				I find it quite easy to get anywhere from 20-25 a roll or even 20 for personally made caps. It is really a matter of educating people that just because you see some whitish/off white shards or powder it isn&#039;t molly and the rolls they are being handed are most likely junk. Try handing out a few free samples to some friends or even local dealers, this will make them come crawling back for more.

It creates a message that gets around.

				Go to a euro seller.<br /><br />The whole &quot;problem with imports coming from Netherlands area&quot; is VASTLY overstated.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most of that was a lie started by selective scammers like Aakoven and Noriega (who are mates irl) so they could have a conceivable excuse for why most of their USA orders were getting &quot;seized&quot;. Their seizure rate for USA was a lot higher than all the other NL vendors. At the very worst this was scamming (which is 100% with Noriega, as he pulled an FE scam and ran off), and at the very best they were incompetent and used shit packaging. I tend to think scamming, due to the evasive and constantly equivocating way in which Aakoven would try to slime his way out of the continuous accusations (made by reputable people) made against him. <br /><br />Unfortunately he manages to hide, as he had befriended many well known vendors, who would back him up, as they were not privy to the exact extent of his scamming.

A ridiculous mentality, perpetuated by teenagers, who have no nuance of thought, and who didn&#039;t analyse the situation in any sort of depth.<br /><br />In either case, if you look at the statistics that were analyzed, the seizure rate for Aakoven to the USA was much much much higher than other NL vendors. He is primarily where this myth of it being really really really hard to get stuff from NL to USA comes from. <br /><br />Truth is, whilst the seizure rate may be slightly higher, with very high quality packaging (which all top vendors should be using), your shit will probably get through. I have friends stateside who buy powder/pills all the time from euro vendors and it is very very rare that anything get seized.

There is so much fake stuff on the market, this is intended to supply you with real known drugs. People who sell shit as other drugs are beyond shady, they are the scum of the earth. You don&#039;t know how an RC which has barely been tested will interact with any number of medications, even generic OTC&#039;s. It is essentially saying you don&#039;t give a flying fuck about their health when you do that. Make sure people are informed and educated when you give them a substance, that&#039;s your motherfucking DUTY

				lol. typical internet flaming when people hear about M1 being represented as molly. <br />E has been misrepresented for years. it is up to the USERS to verify the drugs contents, as this is unregulated black market activity.<br />I personally do not misrepresent the product -- if someone asks me, I tell them, it&#039;s BK-MDMA.<br />I then explain the product inside and out. In many ways, M1 is superior to MDMA. It&#039;s not all about the potency!<br />How about being able to function the next day? M1 is very likely less neurotoxic than MDMA due to it&#039;s 1/3 serotonin receptor antagonist action.<br />It&#039;s dopamine action is the same....and that system recovers quickly. Serotonin takes longer. So for regular users and abusers, I am almost certain BK is superior if you are not looking at it solely in terms of the rush. Obv MDMA is 2nd to none in that department.<br />Also, I find the empathetic feeling on M1 to be less pronounced than MDMA, which means not acting like such an E tard in the wrong environments or settings. Now as far as the misrepresentation, the issue is, EVERYONE thinks that M1/Meph/MDPV etc IS MOLLY.<br />I remember before I was involved in this, going to someone&#039;s house to buy weed. He took out a large bag and said &quot;check out this molly&quot; ... to which I replied &quot;Oh yeah, that&#039;s nice shit! You know that&#039;s BK right?&quot; and he said &quot;No, it&#039;s molly&quot;. Another dealer I knew of said the exact same thing, not even knowing that it wasn&#039;t &quot;molly&quot; ... in his mind (and the customers).....It was!! Another 2 sources in my area sell &quot;molly&quot; and it&#039;s BK. These guys were the only ones that were even aware that it wasn&#039;t MDMA. However, in the minds of all their customers, it is &quot;molly&quot;....A heavy user I know who I gave a sample to just described it as &quot;5/10 molly&quot; ....so the point is, people just think that it&#039;s &quot;weaker&quot; molly. Molly is NOT MDMA. It&#039;s MDXX. yes, molly is SUPPOSED to be MDMA, but in the public perception, this is just not true.<br />When I started to sell M1, I told people what it actually was, all the time. I have always preached harm reduction to a fault. However, there are always people that are like &quot;wait a minute do you mean this is that bath salt shit&quot; and don&#039;t think critically at all or take the time to actually understand my explanation when I tell them what BK is. Marketing BK as MDMA is not really necc because people GOBBLE IT THE FUCK UP no matter what since most people can&#039;t get real shit anyways. But as a matter of simplicity, it helps to just call it &quot;molly&quot; to the uninitiated. You guys can cry all you want about it, I see it on lots of forums, but I am telling you how the game really works, not how it would in a utopian world.

M1 is very likely less neurotoxic than MDMA due to it&#039;s 1/3 serotonin receptor antagonist action.<br />It&#039;s dopamine action is the same....and that system recovers quickly. Serotonin takes longer. So for regular users and abusers, I am almost certain BK is superior if you are not looking at it solely in terms of the rush. Obv MDMA is 2nd to none in that department.<br />Also, I find the empathetic feeling on M1 to be less pronounced than MDMA, which means not acting like such an E tard in the wrong environments or settings. Now as far as the misrepresentation, the issue is, EVERYONE thinks that M1/Meph/MDPV etc IS MOLLY.<br />I remember before I was involved in this, going to someone&#039;s house to buy weed. He took out a large bag and said &quot;check out this molly&quot; ... to which I replied &quot;Oh yeah, that&#039;s nice shit! You know that&#039;s BK right?&quot; and he said &quot;No, it&#039;s molly&quot;. Another dealer I knew of said the exact same thing, not even knowing that it wasn&#039;t &quot;molly&quot; ... in his mind (and the customers).....It was!! Another 2 sources in my area sell &quot;molly&quot; and it&#039;s BK. These guys were the only ones that were even aware that it wasn&#039;t MDMA. However, in the minds of all their customers, it is &quot;molly&quot;....A heavy user I know who I gave a sample to just described it as &quot;5/10 molly&quot; ....so the point is, people just think that it&#039;s &quot;weaker&quot; molly. Molly is NOT MDMA. It&#039;s MDXX. yes, molly is SUPPOSED to be MDMA, but in the public perception, this is just not true.<br />When I started to sell M1, I told people what it actually was, all the time. I have always preached harm reduction to a fault. However, there are always people that are like &quot;wait a minute do you mean this is that bath salt shit&quot; and don&#039;t think critically at all or take the time to actually understand my explanation when I tell them what BK is. Marketing BK as MDMA is not really necc because people GOBBLE IT THE FUCK UP no matter what since most people can&#039;t get real shit anyways. But as a matter of simplicity, it helps to just call it &quot;molly&quot; to the uninitiated. You guys can cry all you want about it, I see it on lots of forums, but I am telling you how the game really works, not how it would in a utopian world. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I understand that it is easier and simpler to just use a generic term. However it is not only disingenuous, but potentially dangerous. If he takes it and has a bad reaction, that&#039;s on you. If he takes it and dies well then you just fucked your life over forever. That&#039;s my point, regardless of the time and effort it takes to give them a quick rundown with a lil proof, it is just as much about covering your ass just like everything you do on here

				I tend not to bulk, just hand out my left overs from various Dutch vendors for a small price and it allows me to continue re-upping for personal use and passing things out to close friends. I have really put a lot of thought into buying from Lucky/FredFlintstone though, apparently even after a couple washes you still retain 90%+ of the product and it is just as potent as any pure Dutch you could get. In my opinion it isn&#039;t worth the risk trying to bulk up from across the seas. The success rate with Lucky shipping from Canada is just way too great to pass up so I may have to splurge at some point and just go for it.

				Weirdal really gave the best advice to everyone, gain respect and confidence. It isn&#039;t always about making a profit for some of us, but respect and confidence do bring in a good cash flow. I have to say I rarely deal out anything, but when I do it is always quality product at a standard street price. I test everything with reagents in front of my customers and friends and whenever they do need a fix I&#039;m the first person they call and the only person they call. I&#039;m sure plenty of you have&nbsp; had a dealer or friend at one time that always treated you well, always gave you everything at a straight price, and never was acting like some crazy dealer or wanna-be baller. This goes for anything not just MDMA. Although for those of you who want to make a profit, just keep selling cheap ass methylone as &quot;Molly&quot; and &quot;MDMA&quot; to the kids, they eat it up like candy. (Seriously though, don&#039;t. Get a real product.)

				I really have no issues with people selling M1 and making tons of money as long as they are honest about what it is. Personally I&#039;ve seen a lot of bad reactions from people taking methylone. I would never sell it, take it, or tell someone its &quot;Molly&quot;. By trade I toy around with futures, energy, and the Forex market, I&#039;m not afraid to get dirty to make some money. When it comes to selling illegal substances I&#039;d rather go for tried and true substances than research chemicals simply for harm reduction. Sure a couple thousand a day might be nice but being responsible for some serious health issues or even death isn&#039;t worth any amount of money.

				Educate me... I was never bashing you Aurelius, I completely accept the fact you make a great profit and are a solid business man. Your last post summed up what I was getting at, the safety is anecdotal for methylone. There are many more things going on besides serotonin and dopamine release when it comes to both substances and how they affect the body. Really there is nothing wrong with M1. I applaud people making such a profit off of their honesty and something that is so cheap for many of us to acquire. I would just stay away from my experiences and what I have seen happen to others.

He is restocking now but usually only seems to take a few days. <br />Around here I sell .15 of BK for $10 and .10 of MDMA for $15. Its 50/50 on what any friend will choose to consume.<br /><br />Im taking a little break from molly myself and thus am not ordering it because its tough not to do on a weekly basis when I have it :D<br /><br />just dumped money into L and boomers for the time being.

				LOL thats funny dude.. To be honest, i didnt know how to react. i also didnt know whether or not he did infact knw what he was doing and didnt care, but after a min or two of me and my friend staring at e.o in fucking shock. i was like &#039;yo, dude..wtf are you doing?!&#039; lol to which he replied, &#039;fuuuck, i forgot where i was&#039; and rolled over to put his limp cock away lmao. then i felt bad for some reason, and was like look, if thats what you need to do, then shit, go sit in your car man, i didnt want him to think i was offended or mad, but i was absolutely shocked. <br /><br />I think that the 2c-b was what did it to him, cause he had that ego softened look in his eyes all night, and he wasnt making any sense at all, the shit he was saying, and responding to us with utter nonsense, like that of a L trip.. trying to pick up 1000lb cement parking blocks and shit lol. had i known i was going to be baby sitting i would have hit him off and sent him on his merry fucking way lol.

				+1 dude. your absolutely 100% correct. I take harm reduction with the utmost seriousness. I do indeed make it a point to dose my clientele. Maybe i wasnt clear that im not really a dealer or reseller. I am just every ones go to guy for the real deal when it comes to any drug that they think they have done or come to love. <br /><br />&nbsp;The ones i cap with a higher dose of MDMA like the 130mg i mentioned, only go to people that i know will be ok with that. Also i make it a very clear point NOT to EVER re dose on one of my rolls, untill at leastt 2 hours after first cap. In almost every instance, the buyer never wound up needing, or wanting that second pill, and save it for another time rather. <br /><br />That same guy that strangled the weasel infront of us, that same night was looking to take two. I gave him the run down, and he thanked me a million times over, for the first real roll hes had, and for preventing him from dropping two and going into some kind of neuroshock. <br /><br />I try to make the rolls, to where it will be almost absolutely unnecessary to any one person to take more than one pill per night. If they are avid on doing so, or like or dislike a particular feeling, i cater the caps to individual preference. When ever im capping a heavy pack, or catering a general order, that will ultimately be&nbsp; from another persons hands, and not mine, i will keep the roll to an average dose.&nbsp; 75mgMDMA,5mg meth,20mg K. The 75mg MDMA is more than enough to get your expected MDMA roll and blow up, the 5mg meth is jusst enough to keep you in a good mood when the molly is on a down swing, and prevent the miserable lows when not at a peak, and the 20mg K is the first thing that is felt when the cap dissolves , perfectly easing you into the come up and first peak of the MDMA.<br /><br />&nbsp;Typically when i have given raw MDMA, it had never got great feedback, mainly due to the shortness of the experience, and terribly depressing come down.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry for not being as detailed as i should have been, i tend to get lazy , and give the masses too much credit, assuming that they wont just skim over something they read and call it set in stone. For any one that has any questions, for me or for any one else that they are looking to get advice from, i urge you , please be thorough. Do not cut corners, and learn all you can before making final decisions. There is no such thing as a dumb question ( not entirely true, but ALWAYS better safe than sorry) Much love Aurelius.

				I tried looking for this in the tread but i have a specific question. How do you go about carrying the pills on you when you go out the club for instance. Do you have each pill in its own baggie already or bag two of them or what do you normally do for distribution? Also, is it dumb to have baggies with any prints on them?

Seems to be the best bet when your in a club, not many options on serving some one drugs.

				How I sell MDMA, I only sell at raves anonymously in the sense that no one except for one person knows my face or name. Any other form of selling is to much risk IMO. <br /><br />&quot;Definitely makes sense to have one person holding the goods, and one person selling then a few at a time. If that person gets caught they should have no more than a few items and very little cash on them. In some cases the runner, even if they got caught could talk their way out of it, either on the scene or in court, whereas holding 15+ grams and a thousand dollars in your pockets is a guaranteed conviction.<br />Just make sure you don&#039;t look too suspicious getting more doses every minute from your mule!<br />That&#039;s how I would look at it anyway...&quot; - UnWizard<br /><br />You can make ALOT of money in one night by doing this, only thing is you have to be careful, because PURE MDMA is hard to find at raves and people that are buying are most likely used to the cut shit so they&#039;ll pop 3-4 caps in one night, that&#039;s why I personally only put .1 in each cap, i&#039;ve had bad experiences with people in the past thinking that they are ODing when in reality they are just rolling to hard because they took double or triple the dose of a normal roll. I hate having to cut down to .1 though but the way customers are it&#039;s a necessity. (When I first started I had .13 - .14 in each cap)

				Ok fellow mdma sellers here&#039;s my situation, what would you do?<br /><br />I&#039;ve only sold small amounts to a select few people here locally and its amazing how many people are ignorant to what real mdma is! These people have been taking M1 and don&#039;t know any better until I put them on the real shit , its fucking crazy!<br />A guy I know sells &quot;Molly&quot; and had a few nights ago I let him try some of my stuff and he said he&#039;s never felt that feeling before! What!?? How in the fuck do you&nbsp; sell &quot;molly&quot; but never actually even rolled before lol!?<br />The game is certainly fucked up!<br /><br />Here&#039;s my predicament; he wants me to sell him &quot;molly&quot; which he now knows is m1 since trying the real shit. He has a huge clientele base in the city next door and they all buy up and love M1 apparently lol.<br />I want to get into the market and with him I can directly sell him oz&#039;s of m1 for 400 an o and he will keep coming back. Seems good deal because of course we can get m1 for cheap on here through China.<br />I don&#039;t like the fact that the sell m1 as molly but the people do buy and they do come back so there is a market.<br />Me personally I wouldn&#039;t sell m1 and claim it to be mdma but this guy knows what it is and still wants it so Im thinking hard about this. I would still keep the real deal for me and my people but would sell him m1 (like i said he knows exactly what it is now) which he would sell to some other dealers. He makes a profit and so do I plus I only have to deal with 1 person which is what I want.<br /><br />How&#039;s all this sounding?<br /><br />

It&#039;s really all up to your morals and standards. Me personally, I&#039;m here to make money....<br /><br />I mean this Is the drug game there&#039;s no rules you have to follow, and obviously people are gonna get burned. I realize most people would assume I&#039;m a horrible person for this, but I got a family to feed and there way more important to me then a group of ignorant college kids that will take anything there dealer sells them. It&#039;s up to you man but If you need money like some of us need money you&#039;ll do anything to get It and this Isn&#039;t to bad of an option for you right now!

				Thanks for replying imghost9...<br /><br />Yeah man Im thinking along those lines. These are hood sellers that don&#039;t leave the block hardly so the people they sell to are regulars..so obviously to me they must like the way it makes them feel or the wouldn&#039;t return. That makes me feel a little bette. But you&#039;re right somebody probably will get burned down the line. <br />Yeah I need the money for sure so I guess I was going to move ahead regardless of what replies I got here. <br />Im just going to have to do it and know that IM not intentionally selling it off as molly .

So you buy a gram of It anywhere from 80-120$ take It home to your testing kit, and find out It&#039;s 30% cocaine, 40% caffeine, 10% baking soda, and a the rest a random series of chemicals you&#039;ve never even heard of! THESE are the people I have a problem with. <br /><br />You flippin M1 at least you know what your puttin out there, but these motherfuckers are marketing a product having NO idea what It even Is just to make quick buck, and will tell you ANYTHING just to sell It with no regards of human life whatsoever.

				SuperTrips has always come through on my orders.&nbsp; I highly recommend him for international orders.<br /><br />I had no intentions of selling.&nbsp; I simply wanted a life-time supply of goods as I cannot find MDMA in person (and if I do, it isn&#039;t MDMA).&nbsp; I made a hefty order of 10g (mind you, hefty for personal use).&nbsp; I figured ~100 doses would last me and a few friends a few years.&nbsp; I donated a few caps to a friend&#039;s party just after the package arrived.&nbsp; The party blew up and people, that evening and all that weekend, were trying to figure out where they came from.<br /><br />One thing led to another, and I ended up setting up a re-selling type thing through two of my good friends (who have been dealing my mushrooms for quite some time).&nbsp; None of the buyers know who I am, these two kids are reliable and in dire need of money, and the product is in high demand.&nbsp; They started at $20 for 125mg (the resellers were selling for $25) and were selling fast.&nbsp; I took them down to $15 so my resellers could take them down to $20.&nbsp; All 80 doses gone in 5 days to only friends-of-friends inside our circle.&nbsp; ~$1,500 was made on a product, not including the re-sellers&#039; ~$400, that cost only ~$360.&nbsp; In 5 days.<br /><br />I re-upped and am now just hanging out for a bit.&nbsp; The money is incredible.. like I haven&#039;t even made so much money this quickly from growing marijuana/mushrooms with low production costs.&nbsp; I need to make a plan, secure up a bit, etc. before I let any more out of my hands.<br /><br />I do plan on moving up with this if I can.&nbsp; It just needs to be done intelligently.

The 3rd person involved in the deal would be someone that I trust and would pay them 20 bucks (or more depending on how much you are having delivered and how much profit you are planning to make). This way IF the guy selling M1 happens to get busted, you aren&#039;t connected. He&#039;s going to rat out your delivery guy. LE is going to have said delivery guy under watch, and if it is a hood dealer like you said, word will get around that he got busted, which means you don&#039;t sell him jack shit any more, not even anything legally haha. Worst case scenario is that police raid the drivers house, bust him little to no evidence (because he doesn&#039;t have any drugs on him, you only give him product right before delivery) and the case goes cold. This IS alot of work just to maintain anonymous but in the long run I have seen it go down very well and LOTS and LOTS of money has been made.

				Whether its real or immitation, if its fire and uncut on your end it pretty much will sell itself and also bring more exposure. &quot;Don&#039;t tell no one its from me&quot;&nbsp; that&nbsp; won&#039;t <br />Work. Its human nature for some once they hear those 7 words they have to tell someone and then they&#039;ll say those 7 words and so on.&nbsp; How you run it depends on how much your thinking of pushing let&#039;s say per round. I won&#039;t say to much if your thinking to make real money ,get a couple drug free runners, yes drugfree they&#039;re out there as i got 4 under me.&nbsp; Greed is a very deadly thing. A great motivator when used right but also can lead to ones downfall. <br /><br />Also, rolls are cheap where you are. My guys push em for $20 a pop $25 if the demand on the strain is high. $180 on 10 packs. at big venues $25 all day long as the stock is something people have a demand for. Mollys we do $60-$85 a gram and up depending on how good it is. The gear just flies off the shelf. Especially college cats and the older crowds at clubs. Rolls i finds the younger cats enjoy em more.

How in the fuck do you&nbsp; sell &quot;molly&quot; but never actually even rolled before lol!?<br />The game is certainly fucked up!<br /><br />Here&#039;s my predicament; he wants me to sell him &quot;molly&quot; which he now knows is m1 since trying the real shit. He has a huge clientele base in the city next door and they all buy up and love M1 apparently lol.<br />I want to get into the market and with him I can directly sell him oz&#039;s of m1 for 400 an o and he will keep coming back. Seems good deal because of course we can get m1 for cheap on here through China.<br />I don&#039;t like the fact that the sell m1 as molly but the people do buy and they do come back so there is a market.<br />Me personally I wouldn&#039;t sell m1 and claim it to be mdma but this guy knows what it is and still wants it so Im thinking hard about this. I would still keep the real deal for me and my people but would sell him m1 (like i said he knows exactly what it is now) which he would sell to some other dealers. He makes a profit and so do I plus I only have to deal with 1 person which is what I want.<br /><br />How&#039;s all this sounding?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dude your In a situation similar to mine, but I can make a 1000 an O easy over here (If passed of for molly)...

				Bk/M1 has flooded the market in my area and it is just now starting to take a turn for the better, thanks to some friends and a little help from myself and others that know of this crazy ass amazon for drugs web site. But it got pretty bad, I know many people that are hooked on Bk and even prefer it to real pure MDMA. No joke I had a customer purchase 120mg from me for a tester and he railed the entire thing in one line, he didn&#039;t even wait 15 min to start laying out a line of bk after he just did a line of the real stuff.

				I don&#039;t see why anyone would sell M1 as MDMA, rather than just selling MDMA as MDMA. <br /><br />In the US, you can easily spend $850 on SR, getting an OZ of great MDMA, and another $50 on a scale/capsule filler/and capsules from the Clearnet.<br /><br />Then you have two options, <br /><br />1. Sell it by the gram to others, 10x100mg capsules for $75. <br />28grams x $75 = $2100 - $900 = <br />$1200 PROFIT<br /><br />2. Sell it by the capsule, people will pay $10 per 100mg capsule all day. You can charge more at events, although I charge $15 for 2x100mg to my regular customers (I&#039;ll explain this later).<br />28grams x 10 (caps per gram) = 280 x $10ea = $2800<br />$2800-$900 =<br />$1900 PROFIT<br /><br />Now all of this is just off of an OZ, and profits will only expand when you start buying more. <br /><br />The great thing about MDMA is, it is currently exploding in popularity. Before it was mainly only popular in the rave scene, but now thanks to rap music becoming obsessed with it, every ghetto/suburban/college/etc. kid with $20 wants to try it. It sells itself. <br /><br />Rather than trying to make the quick buck flipping M1 for a bit larger profit from that one sale, think about the long term. You will quickly lose your customers when they get a taste of real MDMA, but if you are the one selling the MDMA, you&#039;re going to develop long term customers which come back week after week.<br /><br />5 sales with a profit of $10 each is better than 3 sales with a profit of $15 ea.

				Best way to make money selling mdma in my opinion.<br /><br />Now when i was younger i sold to only life long friends, so i sold it anywhere from 5-9 a point depending how much i felt the other person valued our friendship instead of valued my drugs. <br /><br />Now that im slightly older, im selling it at 15/ point 120/g. This is not because im a greedy bastard. (well sorta :D) but many poeple will pay high dollar for pure rock mdma. So i never crush my mdma. I leave it in rocks and sell all the powder to my mates. <br /><br />I now sell at .1 for 10 to my friends and if they get with more of my friends then ill do break downs. Often times when i go to raves ill give all my friends what i get it at if they sell 20 caps for me to their friends. this takes some of the heat off of me, and i coach them who/who not to sell to. basically, if you cant trust them with your life then dont sell to them.<br /><br />It also really helps to have a really cute girl to sell caps for you. Ive gone to raves and had girls sell for me. have them sell it at 20/point. they keep 7$ dollars a cap if they sell all of what they have. ect.<br /><br />sorry for spotty advice, but hope i helped some

				That card trick works pretty well, but the powder seems to stick to the cards..&nbsp; I guess it&#039;s only a problem for the first few caps till the card is coated though.&nbsp; It&#039;s difficult to put large rocks into number 3 caps and those 0 caps are horse pills for small amounts of molly.&nbsp; Also it&#039;s a pain to always get the weight right when you&#039;re capping rocks.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I get rocks, I like to chop off sections, and I&#039;ve gotten it down to +-5mg.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty cool when you can put just 1 chunk into each cap.&nbsp; People straight TRIP when they see that shit! haha. ;)

				There&#039;s a lot of good advice in here, but if you start selling only high quantities than just like caps, it&#039;ll save you a lot of time (which you could use on planning your next comeup) and a lot of hassle.&nbsp; It&#039;s a trade-off, but personally I would probably never ever go back to selling by capsules again unless it was for friends or at a show.&nbsp; I&#039;m biased though I suppose; in my area nobody would ever buy just a capsule lol.

				I&#039;ve had a bit of a hard time getting people interested in Molly. Allot of the ravers want pills only and the effects of MDMA plus whatever is in the pill. Now everyone else, they want Molly all day.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel as comfortable with pills as I don&#039;t want someone to OD for a buck, safe drugs only.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t care there is all kinds of stuff coke, heroin etc that makes money. Surprised people are getting 120 a gram, guess my people have a good deal. I do believe in PLUR unlike allot of people in this game. I have considered making my own pills that are MDMA, pill binder, and caffeine to give that stimulant kick but it would be allot of cost to serve a few customers. <br /><br />Best way to do this is to keep it on the DL.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be the guy who slings at the event to anyone, yes the money is great if you want but the risk is insane. Just spend some time getting your name out and let people come to you.&nbsp; Be the dealer and not the pusher.&nbsp; The pusher is the guy who texts you every few days &quot;yo dawg I got some fire shit&quot; and kind of pressures you to buy.&nbsp; But the dealer doesn&#039;t have to say shit, the clients come when they are ready. People like you allot more when you don&#039;t bother them, this applies in all retail let the customer breath. <br /><br />As far as capping, I don&#039;t do it unless asked since so many people like to finger dab in my area.&nbsp; Especially the jam band crowd which is allot of my client base. <br /><br />

				Take an empty cereal box and use a pen to poke holes in sequential lines throughout one side.Measure X amount of substance and place one cap inside the holes in the box.Take X amount of substance and begin filling the caps. You will be able to spoon small amounts while capturing excess substance.

This is not because im a greedy bastard. (well sorta :D) but many poeple will pay high dollar for pure rock mdma. So i never crush my mdma. I leave it in rocks and sell all the powder to my mates. <br /><br />I now sell at .1 for 10 to my friends and if they get with more of my friends then ill do break downs. Often times when i go to raves ill give all my friends what i get it at if they sell 20 caps for me to their friends. this takes some of the heat off of me, and i coach them who/who not to sell to. basically, if you cant trust them with your life then dont sell to them.<br /><br />It also really helps to have a really cute girl to sell caps for you. Ive gone to raves and had girls sell for me. have them sell it at 20/point. they keep 7$ dollars a cap if they sell all of what they have. ect.<br /><br />sorry for spotty advice, but hope i helped some<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Same here you sound like my twin. Except my girlfriend helps me sell. I know this is off topic but it I saw it work and if anyone here went to Nocturnal in Texas you probably know what Im talking about. There were at least 50+ girls all dressed about the same moving so much weight for some guys. A buyer would walk up they&#039;d hold hands do a giant circle around a building, exchange money and drugs and separate then the girl would be back with a different guy. I watched this for 3 hours because I was so mad at all the money they were making haha

Allot of the ravers want pills only and the effects of MDMA plus whatever is in the pill. Now everyone else, they want Molly all day.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel as comfortable with pills as I don&#039;t want someone to OD for a buck, safe drugs only.&nbsp; If I didn&#039;t care there is all kinds of stuff coke, heroin etc that makes money. Surprised people are getting 120 a gram, guess my people have a good deal. I do believe in PLUR unlike allot of people in this game. I have considered making my own pills that are MDMA, pill binder, and caffeine to give that stimulant kick but it would be allot of cost to serve a few customers. <br /><br />Best way to do this is to keep it on the DL.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be the guy who slings at the event to anyone, yes the money is great if you want but the risk is insane. Just spend some time getting your name out and let people come to you.&nbsp; Be the dealer and not the pusher.&nbsp; The pusher is the guy who texts you every few days &quot;yo dawg I got some fire shit&quot; and kind of pressures you to buy.&nbsp; But the dealer doesn&#039;t have to say shit, the clients come when they are ready. People like you allot more when you don&#039;t bother them, this applies in all retail let the customer breath. <br /><br />As far as capping, I don&#039;t do it unless asked since so many people like to finger dab in my area.&nbsp; Especially the jam band crowd which is allot of my client base.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>=-pills-=<br />idk pills are fine imo if you know whats up either by test kit or by experience.&nbsp; pills are harder to deal with because you might be able to tell whats in it, but unless you send it in to edata there is just a whole bunch of thizz heads trying to guesstimate the ratio&#039;s and percents.&nbsp; those test kids are decent at best.&nbsp; again, are you personally keeping notes of how the roll was in lieu of the reaction time and color?&nbsp; unlike molly where the user can add caffeine, coke, deferral, speed ect pills come in a single set package.&nbsp; i always sell clean, but if someone wants a kick in the ass ill tell them to get some caffeine or soda in them.&nbsp; i personally do not have the brain capacity and or time to be messing around with 1 pill for ever 100.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get more than 100 since people get tired of the same pill real quick (ie pot).&nbsp; &nbsp;certain pills will fly off the shelf depending on what an individual gets down on.&nbsp; people will tell you it was &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; but use these words to their standards.&nbsp; in short some people like speedy rolls vs getting floored and varying degrees in between.&nbsp; the only person i trust is myself.&nbsp; yes, i did get tricked a few times and got some speedy rolls, but you live and you learn and apologize if need be <br /><br />-=da math=-<br />at this point i can get molly cheaper than pills so there is no real intensive.&nbsp; i have a 330% mark up from molly (buy at 3 sell at 10) where as pills will get me 200% (by at 6 sell at 12 or 2 for 25).&nbsp; furthermore, molly is easier and smaller to ship than pills (less risk ftw).&nbsp; i would say fuck it with using a press/mold.&nbsp; you can make your own, but you have to use the right binder/filler.&nbsp; chemist friend says to use a filler with similar molecule size as mdma to get a 1:1 ratio when you mix it.&nbsp; imo leave the presses to the mass market since people can fuck up and or your pills might break/fall apart (ruled this out and have done little to no research).&nbsp; all the pills i have bought were a mo or 2 old from pill reports and from the general region.&nbsp; if you are smart you will never end up with pipes.&nbsp; test on the spot at your dealers spot.&nbsp; no fucking returns son!<br /><br />i have a few heads that say molly doesnt get them wild out.&nbsp; i truly do not understand how they are not affected.&nbsp; my best friend in irl has tried molly a few times and well he says he feels minimal affects at best and clearly doesn&#039;t &quot;roll&quot; so is uninterested.&nbsp; anyways i have had great pills in past and some speedy.&nbsp; only once did i get fucked my by dealer and got pipes.&nbsp; i never understand why my dealer fucked me once and never picked up again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />=-selling at events/clubs/undos/ect=-<br />i disagree with you on a few points.&nbsp; i wouldn&#039;t just blanket my argument and say not to sell at events.&nbsp; all my dealers knew local dj&#039;s and promoters and such so they could sell at these undos and smaller events if they wanted to.&nbsp; the people putting on the show know people are going to be on drugs ect and they hire security.&nbsp; they are not hiring police for these events.&nbsp; you can sell, but you have to know if you have the &quot;right/privilege&quot; to sell or security will grab your shit and kick you out.&nbsp; <br /><br />i would say its more risky to sell large events ie edc and or your wed-sat club as they will fuck you in the ass/get you blacklisted/call the cops depending on the situation (friend is an emt and has worked private mansion parties and well know edm club events).&nbsp; of course, your risk and reward is higher as you can easily sell for double and if your shit is good/solid you may get return custos if you go to those things often.<br /><br />=-personal story time=-<br />i was one of those atypical people asking for rolls at an event and ran into an old high school buddy who was &quot;out&quot; possibly playing it smart, but gave me his info and he plugged me for a solid 4 years.&nbsp; friends bro was at a famous edm club and met a guy and ran into him a few hours later.&nbsp; his shit was good so they swapped numbers.&nbsp; homie been getting 1/2 o fairly frequently.&nbsp; i have swapped numbers with people who have asked (on a burner) and if they are local ill hit them back up to meet up and possibly hook them up.&nbsp; i also got set up by a friends friend.&nbsp; it was quite clear some bullshit was going on either that i was going to get jacked or fed to le.&nbsp; if this doesnt sound right or too good stop put it behind you and move on.&nbsp; <br /><br />things can happen, but you have to weigh out the risk reward.&nbsp; imo its easy to spot an undo, but it may be harder to spot an undo from afar if you are being watched.&nbsp; i have in past sold a few at major events to take care of my ticket and then get fucked up afterwards.&nbsp; its hard to concentrate (at least for me) to sell/have fun/and keep an eye out.&nbsp; dealers old trick is to pop a pill in his mouth and pass it off as a kiss.&nbsp; idk if this would work as i have never done this, but most times when i sell to people i look to see if their eyes are dilated and pissing with sweat/ got them wiggles and hot as fuck (yes i will touch you on your arm first).&nbsp; i tell them to not look at the pill and give them the choice of either taking it now or slipping it into their cloths or w.e&nbsp; too many times have i seen randoms selling to people and having the receiving party (and friends) examining the pill ect either by all huddling together and looking down or lifting it in the air and examining it.&nbsp; after i sell i peace the fuck out of that area!&nbsp; <br /><br />=-pushing?=-<br />i greatly disagree with you on calling me and or my techniques one of a pusher even if i don&#039;t hit my people up every few days.&nbsp; 1-no one who is buying molly would need/want molly every few days.&nbsp; 2-sign of desperation.&nbsp; if the client can not simply say no then well slaughter to the sheep.&nbsp; are you calling advertising companies pushers?&nbsp; does mcd push their product and cause you to eat their food?&nbsp; if so that is just sad.&nbsp; yes, i am advertising my product and will use my brain and simple skills to make sales.&nbsp; i need to know this information if i am going to need to buy more product.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it unjust for me to not have enough product when i have 10 people call for edc and i only have 10g and people want a total of 20?&nbsp; someone is going to get fucked here.&nbsp; people are IRRESPONSIBLE and don&#039;t give 2 SHITS about you or the hard work you put in constantly!&nbsp; stoners of all people are the worse.&nbsp; they don&#039;t care that they are ABOUT to run out.&nbsp; they WILL call when they are OUT.&nbsp; they can&#039;t do the responsible thing and hit you up a day or two in advance and ask if you got any and can hold some.&nbsp; i run my business as a business.&nbsp; its called RETENTION.&nbsp; you need retention in this business as its inevitable that people drop out of the scene/stop doing drugs.&nbsp; tahts fine; thats great, but please respectfully inform the dealer.&nbsp; i had a guy literally ask me for an o yesterday.&nbsp; no advanced warning at all.&nbsp; just expects me to be holding for him!&nbsp; i have made plenty of sales either in advanced or just because people loose their phone/ your number.&nbsp; buying drugs is not as easy as it is for certain people.&nbsp; consider this.&nbsp; people get nervous and scared.&nbsp; if i havnt seen someone in a while ima give them a call and see wahts up.&nbsp; sometimes you have to update your customs on shit.&nbsp; yes, i did provide some shady sales techniques like telling them you are out of town or will be low on supply, but i can&#039;t stress the importance of staying in somewhat of constant contact.&nbsp; i have made mistakes and have bought too much gear or thought i could clear stuff by a certain time.&nbsp; this was before i started keeping track of who was buying what and at what rate.&nbsp; More importantly is to figure out if your custo is going to someone else or if they are tired of your product/ dont like it.&nbsp; people don&#039;t like confrontation especially with you (the dealer) and only the most bold of people will say johnny down the street is selling me .1 for $7.&nbsp; &nbsp;people will always play down the bads and over hype the good.&nbsp; i can not help them if they don&#039;t tell me if it was bad or if they didn&#039;t like it.&nbsp; again people have different tastes and their tastes should be met.&nbsp; <br /><br />-=final words=-<br />try to remember your entry lvl or early drug dealers.&nbsp; remember how difficult it was to talk to them, to get product, to have them show up ect.&nbsp; maybe you had a good guy- if so, to remember what this person did.&nbsp; emulate the greats and note what the &quot;bad&quot; drug dealers did.&nbsp; its a weird thing to say, but you arn&#039;t just helping out your friend you are dealing dr00gs.&nbsp; class 1 drug might i add with some states that have minimum drug sentencing.&nbsp; think of how you are getting these drugs too.&nbsp; take a moment to let it all sink in.&nbsp; shit can hit the fan.&nbsp; we talk about being prepared, but truly are we?&nbsp; selling is merely only one lvl of the game.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />=-some simple science- that 84% purity=-<br />so i had a chance to talk to my chemist friend.&nbsp; in short u can have mdma with &quot;abnormality&quot; (my phrase not his) as i do not remember the correct scientific phrase (maybe someone who knows can tell us all), but you can have for example a 4 carbon chain&nbsp; shaped differently.&nbsp; scientifically it is the same 4 carbon chain, but in reality the location of the carbons will affect the high on the person.&nbsp; i don&#039;t know if that really helped any of you, but if you pay attention different sellers have &quot;different&quot; mdma effects even though they are all relatively a high purity.&nbsp; i trust my friend (chem degree) that the placements of the same molecules result in a different high.

				Let me chime in on the topic of capping. It&#039;s been done for years with legal substances, on a much larger scale. People have come up with MUCH more efficient ways of capping than the funnel method.<br />Here&#039;s one: I haven&#039;t done this myself, do it&#039;s just theoretical advice, but you should be able to work out the details yourself :)<br /><br />USE A CAPSULE FILLER DEVICE! It costs around 25$ Here&#039;s a google link: https://www.google.com/search?q=capsule+filler<br /><br />1. Work out how much powder fits into your capsule. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s 500mg, I&#039;ll use this amount for the example.<br />1. Crush the 10grams of&nbsp; MDMA into a fine powder. Add 40 grams of binder (glucose?). You can add caffeine at this stage, or whatever additives you wish. Just make sure it all adds up to 50grams, so the math is easier :)<br />2. Now you need 500 capsules. Put their halves in the capsule filling device. Pour the powder on it, use the spatula to fill&nbsp; all the capsules.<br />3. Cover the caps with the other halves.<br />Now you have 500 caps with 100mg of MDMA each.<br /><br />Always make sure you don&#039;t keep the equipment where you can get busted (your home).<br />Hope this helps!

Let&#039;s say it&#039;s 500mg, I&#039;ll use this amount for the example.<br />1. Crush the 10grams of&nbsp; MDMA into a fine powder. Add 40 grams of binder (glucose?).

Put their halves in the capsule filling device. Pour the powder on it, use the spatula to fill&nbsp; all the capsules.<br />3. Cover the caps with the other halves.<br />Now you have 500 caps with 100mg of MDMA each.<br /><br />Always make sure you don&#039;t keep the equipment where you can get busted (your home).<br />Hope this helps!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />now thats a thought!<br /><br />

Just because someone knows them and they were cool the last event doesn&#039;t mean shit. Please be careful. Those bigger festivals are actually safer to not get caught. Need another woodstock <br /><br />look up gnarnia festival last year. pretty much everyone that had drugs there was busted. It was a small festival and they rounded up nearly everyone! saw some people posting on it here and almost went. glad I didn&#039;t! :p

I started putting more in figuring I was hooking people up but after reading this thread I have decided to be more precise with each pill capped up.<br /><br />Not interested in festivals or dealing with people I don&#039;t know in real life, that shit sketches me out, I sold like a hundred pressed pills like ten years ago to a friend before UMF and right at the beginning he was handing them out and undercovers ran up and tackled him out of nowhere. One of my chicks saw this and saw that he threw the pack and gave it back to me, we just handed it that shit out to our extended group of friends, didn&#039;t want the bad karma from selling it twice and it helped out my buddy because he got caught with only one pill on him. <br /><br />After that I decided to stay away from festivals and the like. Plus I enjoy the scene and the music and I can never fully enjoy myself if I go there with an ulterior motive, my friends just know to come to me before hand. That way I only go in with personal amounts and can fully enjoy myself and the company of fly chicks rolling with me haha. <br /><br />Just glad I found this site because everything around me, and I live in a major metropolitan area, is methylone in that scene now. Now that I have the pure shit from Europe, I tell people to bring me any pills they get and test those in front of them. The methylone turns bright yellow and my shit smokes straight to black. I&#039;m almost out and have been telling people I&#039;m retiring but I can help them out for larger amounts, this way I don&#039;t have to be the guy that peddles pill by pill and I don&#039;t have to have a huge stash hidden where I live. That way its in and out of my hands fast and I make a significant amount of change quickly. <br /><br />

I&#039;d say sell M1 on the street and use the profit to get a nice MDMA headstash. <br />It&#039;s important to consider also that M1 and MDMA are different drugs when it comes down to it.<br />Just try this: Take a 120 mg dose of MDMA on a Saturday<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then: Take a 250 mg dose of bk-MDMA (M1) the following Saturday<br />Compare the depth of the feelings from each roll.<br /><br />In my opinion, M1 is more &quot;surface-y&quot; than MDMA, which is deeper emotionally and more of a &quot;trip&quot; like LSD, for example.<br />I also am more inclined for sex on M1 than on MDMA. I think about sex on both, but it&#039;s way easier to act out sexual fantasies on M1 than it is on MDMA (for me at least). I like to use MDMA sparingly, like maybe once or twice per year. It&#039;s a special thing. M1, however, I am more willing to take more often like mephedrone. Cathinones are definitely closer to cocaine than MDMA, but of course still have many of the same characteristics like empathy, music appreciation, tactile enhancement, euphoria, etc. <br /><br />Great prices on your M1, by the way southern m1. Might be trying out your gear soon :)

				It&#039;s less potent at about 60% potency as mdma and also less toxic s an be dosed more frequently. Thanks for the comment about my prices I have them lower to generate sales and don&#039;t feel the need to gouge people.

You will be out of business because no one will pay your prices when they&#039;re used to paying the price for m1, I&#039;m not insulting you so there&#039;s no need to get upset. I&#039;m just stating that someone selling mdma cannot match the prices people selling m1 can hit and will go out of business since people on the street are used to m1 being &quot;molly&quot; anyways.

				Many people around me have been getting the methylone shit, that tests yellow. the kids selling it aren&#039;t even testing it and selling it as mdma (apparently unknowingly), because every one of their customers says it&#039;s awesome and the best roll ever, etc. A lot of people I know as well have been getting cheap as fuck xtc pills. This one nigger kid i know got a 10 sack and 2 pills for 25 bucks. He told me he doesn&#039;t like mdma anymore because he ended up getting a meth bomb instead. Maybe he should get better hook ups and stop being a stupid nigger. <br /><br />So I&#039;ve been getting 50g molly from the road and selling grams for 60, effectively tripling my money at this price. At the same time PEOPLE LOVE IT! I could be an asshole and charge up to 100 bucks (others have done this when I stopped selling for a bit), but I&#039;m not like that. <br /><br />selling 100mg is too much of a pain in the ass to weigh out. I dont like to sell those amounts! let your foot soldiers do that work.<br /><br /><br />

				^ Exactly! These kids that I associated with, were charging a premium because they thought they had actual MDMA. <br /><br />they charged 60/half gram, 110/gram because they saw it as they were the only ones in town with it. Until one of my buddies came over, equipped with a marquis test. people were pissed once it tested yellow , cuz the sellers were ranting and raving about a product that wasn&#039;t what they said it was and people put out good money for it. but the sellers negotiated with many of my friends and gave some of them their money back, while there were others who didn&#039;t mind at all, as that they had an actual good time on the M1, despite it not being mdma.

It&#039;s charging what you want to charge. Being an asshole is selling some other chemical as MDMA or cutting your MDMA. THAT&#039;s being an asshole. If you ask for 100/g, people don&#039;t have to pay that. If they can&#039;t afford what is charged, one could try to work something out, but again, putting a pricetag on something is your right as the seller. That&#039;s great if you sell it for a very low price, but selling it for a higher price does not make you an asshole.

				I would never use SR to get any RC, its utterly stupid when you think of it but thats just me. <br />If you want a speedy role then mix mdma and mda or mdma and meth but the meth utterly has to be crystal shards. 20mg meth and 100mg mdma is a good old time, you can up the meth to 50mg if you would like but lets not is what i will say.

				thebaketrio where would you suggest getting RC then. because if you dont know anyone with connects SR is the safest way. half the people selling rcs on the clear net are scams and you would never see your money again. on the other hand with SR....<br />now for mdma vs mda i have only done mda 1 time and mdma about 1000. mda is pretty intense but ive grown out of the rolling faz now not sure why just dont like to b geekd up when i need to be clear headed. <br /><br />mda was nice though and i could definatly tell the difference between the two when i was high on mda. i knew it was different. it was only a sample i got to test but it was nice. my friends loved it. mda gives you more of a euphoric feeling i think. a little more intense

				Bringing this thread back to life. <br /><br />What kind of prices do you charge your foot soldiers?<br />Just getting started and I&#039;m thinking 1400 for an oz, 850 for a half, 500 for 7g, and 290 for a ball. $100 - $120 for a G depending on quality.<br />As much as I want to be a jew and charge more, I feel like if I do charge more, there will be 0 incentive because profit margins would be shit for them. <br /><br />I like capping em up at 160 for $25. Gives you 6 caps even with a little spillage accounted for. People around here are too fucking stupid to buy two 100mg caps @ $10-15 each, so I feel like its easier on retarded peoples brain to just offer the 150-180 mg caps for more $. <br /><br />Thoughts?
