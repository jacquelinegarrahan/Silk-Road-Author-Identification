				@http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=96249#ixzz2fuYEYsCF<br /><br />1. scrape or pick off the color coating of the pill. Don&#039;t use water to wash it off, you don&#039;t wan&#039;t to get your pill wet. It will fourm a layer of gel due to the TimerX<br /><br />2.Crush the pill as finely as possible<br /><br />3. Take a shot glass and fill it up about half way with alcohol. Rubbing alcohol is what they used any thing over 90% should work. You wan&#039;t alcohol that doesn&#039;t leave behind an residue when boiled off. Place some of the alcohol you wan&#039;t to use in a pan. Boil it all off and check the bottom of the pan for any kind of residue a tiny bit is okay but the less the better.<br /><br />4. Add the crushed Opana to the glass of alcohol stir it we&#039;ll let it sit for at least 20mins. Stiring it every minute or so<br /><br />5. Filter it , some how you must filter out all the particles left in the alcohol. Get two large clean and dry syringe of some kind , they use two 3cc syringes with the needles pulled out. Take out the plunger on one syringe and pack it with a large clump of dry cotton. use enough so theres about a 1/3 to 1/2 inch layer of packed cotton. Take the other syringe and begin drawing up the alcohol and spraying it into the other syringe once full. Put the plunger back on the cotton packed syringe and spray the alcohol though filtering it. Continue doing this untill all the alcohol has been filtered<br /><br />6. Take the shot glass of filtered alcohol and place it on an electric stove turn the heat on medium high and slowly boil off the alcohol. DON&#039;T use a gas stove alcohol fumes are heavy and will fall down to the flame and ignite. I don&#039;t know if useing a Microwave would work. Some how boil off the alcohol while doing so constantly blow on the shot glass this will blow the fumes away and help it boil down much faster. Once theres only a tiny bit of alcohol left take it off the heat and swish it around once it has all boiled off there will be a layer of Oxymorphone and part of the TimerX<br /><br />7. Add how ever much water your needle holds to the glass and stur it up there will be a film that fourms and clumps together this is good. Let it sit in the water for around 10-15 mins. Add a piece of cotton to the mix for a filter and draw it up into your rig and your done. Adding a little citric acid or sour salt to the water helps break it down.<br /><br />Lastly be VERY careful IVing Oxymorphone is 9-10 times stronger then eating it dont even bother IVing it unless you need to snort around 30mg+ to feel any thing even then start out with no more then 5mg your first time<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp; Why not alternate soaking it in water with soaking it in concentrated HCl? is it enteric coated?&nbsp; <br />You should be able to reproduce the contents of your stomach, pH ~2 then pH 8 in the duodenum if it gets that far.&nbsp; All opiates are extremely soluble in cold water, so if you can somehow get it wet, then freeze it, you might be able to break the polymer matrix with ice crystals, that is another idea I&#039;ve been playing around with, not that I do that stuff anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;These people here take them and microwave them and then bake them in an oven and add water, microwave again, which sounds horrible on the veins.&nbsp; Good luck!<br />

				Pretty sure I&#039;ve shot those before just by scraping the coating off and cooking it in the spoon. Can&#039;t remember for sure how well it worked though, might have gelled up a bit. Might be one of those that you have to get in the rig and into your veins really quick or it&#039;ll gunk up on ya. Aren&#039;t those the fucking WORST? Had to eat the gel a couple times cause of that bullshit. Fucking hate it.<br /><br />Opanas are the bees knees though. Happy nodding. ;)
