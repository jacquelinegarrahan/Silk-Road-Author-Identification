				Is the RC scene dead? There seem to be no new promising chemicals coming out to research in a while.

				A bunch of good vendors closed shop this summer. The last thing I think I was excited about was... Escaline I believe. Sounded promising, reviews showed up, not so special after all. That&#039;s kind of my experience with the RC scene. The chemicals just aren&#039;t so special. 6-APB is okay, but not worth taking in regard to side affects. MXE, the weird stims and the trypts kind of keep the scene floating, but you can buy .5-1 gram of any of those trypts and be good for the next 3 years if you have a bit of a variety. MXE always seems to wear people down eventually. <br /><br />The RC market just isn&#039;t that sustainable, especially when the the most popular products are shitty stims that cater to a niche.

				It kind of seems to come and go in waves.&nbsp; Perhaps its a time for it to chill out a bit?&nbsp; One could hope that if it does there would be time for some research and development and bring some more worthwhile materials to the table.

				I&#039;ve been wondering this myself.&nbsp; There never seems to be any really good US domestic MXE vendors lately, and I do love me some MXE.&nbsp; I&#039;ve also tried 4-HO-MET and it was awesome.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s not more popular, it felt very natural to me.&nbsp;

				It&#039;s far from dead, a walk into any pub / club in the UK any weekend your find empty packets of RC&#039;s all over the place!!<br /><br />Its declining a little on here, but I have seen that change over night! I think the reason is that any drug savvy person who has tried most RC&#039;s has come to the same conclusion. They are a cheap, often bad imitation of what the try to mimic. Really mimic nothing and are very much drugs in there own right, sadly with little research done on them.<br /><br />SR is a drug savvy community for the best part. Most of us round hear have realized that the novelty of RC is just that. Not to say all are a waste of time, but most cause so many problems for people, it&#039;s not worth the bloody risk anymore. Any why would you, we have access to just about everything we could ever ask for here.<br /><br />

				People will continue to make them and advance further. They are only a Research chem for so long.
