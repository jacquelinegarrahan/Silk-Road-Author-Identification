				I didn&#039;t really want to come to this but I was really hoping to get at least an 1/8th of marijuana this week but unfortunately I missed out on a really good deal, but yet I&#039;ve stumbled upon another good price but I only have 8.42BTC in my account whereas the cost of the product I&#039;m hoping to get is 8.96. I will pay you back a whole bitcoin as soon as I redeem my next MP card (I honestly can&#039;t guarantee when this shall be, so add me on the forums). My SR buyer account name is the same as my community forum username. Also, if there&#039;s any simple favor you could use that an average Joe could handle then let me know! Thanks in advance, if there&#039;s someone with such generosity.
