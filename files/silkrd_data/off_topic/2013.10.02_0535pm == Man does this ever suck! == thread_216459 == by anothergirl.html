				I was in the process of finding that info, but I still felt like ranting :)&nbsp; Hopefully I&#039;ll figure it out in time.<br /><br />And my beautiful, perfect, honest stats... all gone.<br /><br />Oh well, at least I didn&#039;t lose any serious money due to the timing of the shutdown like I&#039;m sure lots did.

				Wow so you actually gave up everything you were doing(guess it wasn&#039;t that much) to travel the world trying different countries different drugs when finding out about silk road? Did you even want to try drugs before you heard of the road? How much did you know about drugs before? Amazing.

Then I found about about the deep web, and so I started researching, and planned my first trip. I pretty consistently hated pot, but once I tried LSD and shrooms it was like my whole drugless life had been such a waste up to that point. But unable to obtain a visa to live in any countries with domestic vendors and/or non-draconian drug laws, I decided instead to just temporarily &quot;live&quot; in a few countries as I ticked all the drugs on my to do list off. And luckily LSD is stealthy enough that I can still enjoy at least that back home.

Women are the ones who keep voting socialist, big government parties into office. So if you are against fascism, and are pro-libertarian, you should start a movement to repeal women&#039;s voting rights.<br /><br />Just think about it. If women didn&#039;t have the right to vote, we never would have had Obama.<br /><br />55 percent of women voted for Obama<br />54 percent of men voted for Romney<br /><br />Women are behind the ever increasing destruction of freedom in the West. They are using feminism, political correctness, affirmative action, and anti-male legal policies to accomplish this goal.<br /><br />Giving women the right to vote, giving women any freedom at all, was the beginning of the end of the West.
