				Glad you love your first grow room. It&#039;s good to feel pride in your success in the grow room, too. I guess it&#039;s cool to post about it here on SR forums, but hey... Something always makes me cringe when I see someone posting a little Grow Gloat. Remember the first and only rule of grows: Nobody but you should know about it.&nbsp; ;)

				I too love growing, and it&#039;s great to hear from others who enjoy the actual growing process, not just the end results.&nbsp; It&#039;s a massively rewarding hobby, and it has changed my life for the better in many ways.<br /><br />No harm in sharing your love of growing, especially on here.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t come across as bragging to me, although if I wasn&#039;t in a position to grow for myself I would probably feed a tad envious reading these kinds of threads lol.&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, I think that most (adult) smokers are probably in a position to grow if they wanted to, unless they have an anti-drug wife, or still live with parents, or whatever.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s usually just a question of scale, but even a small grow can be worthwhile, both in cost/yield terms, and in terms of gaining valuable experience and knowledge of the plant&#039;s needs and life cycle.
