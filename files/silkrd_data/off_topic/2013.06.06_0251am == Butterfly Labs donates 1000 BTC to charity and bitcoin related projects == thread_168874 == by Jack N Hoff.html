				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Today, Butterfly Labs is giving a sneak peak at a new project that aims to promote charities and other projects that benefit the greater bitcoin community. The new site is called Bitcoin Development Fund and is intended to be a gathering place for those who wish to donate to various projects or charities through the use of bitcoin, but may not know where to go to do so or how to properly vet credible charities and projects.<br /><br />Because we missed our power targets we set forth when we began our ASIC development, we are starting off the fund with a donation of 1000 BTC, which is valued currently over $120,000 USD. The BDF project will allocate funds to worthy charities and project as time goes on. Currently the BDF site is in phase one of the roll out, but more user interaction and participation in the selection of projects and charities to donate to is planned for phase two and three.<br /><br />If you have a charity or open source project that you believe benefits the greater bitcoin community, please feel free to submit it to submit@bitcoindf.org. It will be reviewed and vetted by the BitcoindDF for inclusion into the site.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />https://forums.butterflylabs.com/content/134-butterfly-labs-donates-1000-btc-charity-bitcoin-related-projects.html

				Yeah I was pretty happy to see that the other day. I will definitely be donating in the future. It is almost definitely just a cop out for extra PR, but there wasnt really any way to donate bitcoins before now so I am glad that they set it up. I mean if you think about it realistically 1000 bitcoins would be stretched pretty thin if they were to actually do something for all their customers.

Cryptrade produced an award-winning website and marketing video (above) to attract Kickstarter backers. And it worked; the Kickstarter campaign successfully raised $196,404 from 989 backers.<br /><br />The problem is, Cryptrade began to go silent after the campaign ended, posting fewer updates as time went on until ultimately it went completely silent. Cryptrade never delivered on their promise to produce and deliver the CRXi Vault, and has completely ignored repeated inquires and requests for refunds by its backers. As of June 1st, 2013, those backers are still trying to contact Cryptek’s founder, Fahad Koumaiha without success.<br /><br />Kickstarter has not yet resolved this situation, and there is little hope that it will. Despite profiting from the nearly $200,000 campaign, complaints to Kickstarter are met with a boilerplate “our hands our tied” response.<br /><br />With little hope of getting a refund, one backer plans on hiring an attorney:<br /><br />So how exactly does this relate to Bitcoin?<br /><br />Well it turns out that Crypteks is back at it again under the name Cryoniks, Inc. and this time they’re targeting the Bitcoin community with a “1000 GH/S Cryonic Bitmining Solution” called “FrostBit.” The beautifully-designed website is eerily similar to Crypteks, and both companies are represented by the same law firm, Safford &amp; Baker, PLLC in Bloomfield Hills, MI.<br /><br />Redditor hak8or specifically detailed how the Frostbit machine cannot physically exist on the basis of physics and engineering. (http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1feju1/owner_of_cryoniks_1000ghs_bitcoin_miner_has)<br /><br />According to its Facebook page, Cryoniks has already met 80% of its quota for pre-orders.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
