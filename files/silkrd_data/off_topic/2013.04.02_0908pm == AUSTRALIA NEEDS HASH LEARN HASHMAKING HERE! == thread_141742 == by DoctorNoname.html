				SR has been good to all of us and I think I have a practical way of paying you guys back whilst solving a problem.<br /><br />I need volounteers, possibly three good, strong, brave pioneers to grow some of the finest cannabis mankind has ever seen.<br /><br />My offer is to by some seeds, 1BTC&#039;s worth for the selected volounteers. We will develop a plan, either I can teach you indoor growing or I teach you the finer points of outdoor growing seeing as you have the space and climate.<br /><br />So I need you fine Australian Revolutionaries and Revolitionetts to apply within and tell me why you should be my apprentice.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor<br /><br />P.S. I want to see any excess sold on SR at reasonable prices of course

				If it is abundant then why are your prices the highest in the world? My suggestion is not that of bad quality by any means but at around $30/gram your nation must be suffering a shortage of some kind. Britain is the same and it is mainly because our drugs are grown by foreign gangs who aren&#039;t very good at it. We need to take our nation back from them but you guys have SO MUCH SPACE to get crazy with the growing.<br /><br />Also, good hash is made from good weed, you guys have the space to grow for hash if you wanted. Australia could become a premier hash producing nation with the right strategies.<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				The prices on SR don&#039;t provide an accurate indication of the market here. A very large proportion of our population smokes and very few of these smokers would ever consider buying buds off SR.<br /><br />The average street prices in AU for hydro:<br />A stick (1.5g) = $25<br />A fitty (3g) = $50<br />A quarter (7g) = $90<br />An oz (28g) = $250 - $300<br />The Lebanese do it a little differently but only a fool would pay more than $300 an Ounce... (Around $10 a gram)<br /><br />You&#039;re onto something with the hash though! You may be surprised to know that very few Australians have ever even tried hashish. It&#039;s very sad indeed; but also a dormant market waiting for the chosen entrepreneurs.

				Thats really interesting, why the SR discrepancy then?<br /><br />The outback would be perfect to grow large isolated plants to make premium hash out of, that could be an idea...<br /><br />Is most of your bud grown by gangs of a certain Asian persuasion?<br /><br />Jah Bless <br /><br />The Doctor

				SR erb is for smokers who are desperate because their dealers are dry, or they&#039;ve moved to a new town, etc...<br /><br />You are 100% correct about the premium hashish idea. Australians have a preference for hydroponic bud - nobody buys/sells bush (at least in the cities) so we don&#039;t use our land for the holy plant. If the land was used to grow premium bush and this plant was used to make hashish - then what a blessing!<br /><br />Also you must keep in mind that although we have copious amounts of land, most of it is barren.<br /><br />The bud is grown by no particular ethnic group - individuals of many nationalities have been caught with hydroponic setups in their homes and there doesn&#039;t seem to be any pattern in their racial origin. A sharp rise in electricity usage sets off alarms for potential growers in urban areas - while in rural areas some of the larger hydroponic operations are found by heat detecting helicopters.<br /><br />Never in our many years however have we encountered a general shortage of the herb...

				World Aid for Aussie&#039;s!<br /><br />It&#039;s like famine in Africa.&nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody wants to grow or take care of themselves.<br />Making hash is a joke.&nbsp; Oil too.&nbsp; Very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;As fucking if.&nbsp; &nbsp;Down under has a great growing season there is no reason. Also, There are many hallucinogenic plants and insects around.&nbsp; They should have manufactured their own psychedelic by now.&nbsp; They really need some chemistry lessons!!!

				Well firstly let me apologise for my misunderstanding, I had assumed the prices reflected a shortage but wow, that is even wierder.<br /><br />If one was to explore the outback would one be able to find the occasional stream or waterbody? If so plants could essentially left unattended<br /><br />One could also visit say once a week with a 5l bottle filled with water that has a tiny slow leak in it.<br /><br />I think we might have stumbled onto something here, Outback Hash &amp; Oils!<br /><br />I&#039;ve registered the trademark already<br /><br />Jah Bless<br /><br />The Doctor

				I will get back to you with growing advice soon - very busy ATM.<br /><br />Well it depends on where you live &amp; who you know, but generally street prices for weed in Australia are about $20 / gram, $50 for 3.5gm, $80 for 7gm, $150 for 14gm, $250 - $300 for 28gm.<br />There is definitely no shortage of weed - not around here anyway. There was a shortage from late December through until mid January because everyone wants the stuff for the Christmas / summer holidays. I don&#039;t think Australian weed is much more expensive than other countries, especially when you consider the price of everything here is extremely expensive.<br /><br />Prices on Silk Road reflect the time and effort that is needed for orders, compared to selling IRL. it is much easier outside of SR, and the price on here is higher because of this.<br /><br />Also for some reason people refuse to smoke weed that is not hydro. People only want hydro. I can not understand this, because a lot of bush weed is better than some hydro weed.<br />Also they have helicopters that do fly-overs in some parts of the country and they hunt for cannabis crops. Yep - Our Government knows how to waste money! It&#039;s not even very successful and they rarely find anything.<br /><br />From what I&#039;ve noticed, weed sellers work differently from sellers of other drugs. it is much more relaxed and there is less levels in the chain. Street ecstasy dealers normally get middled 2-3 times, whereas weed dealers would usually get it from the grower or a large-scale distributor.

				Somebody needs to teach us...<br /><br />The buds wouldn&#039;t sell but as soon as sweet hashish hit the streets it would be a revolution!<br /><br />Good point on the hallucinogenics - but remember this is a highly urbanized country and one doesn&#039;t stumble across goldtops or DMT plants in the metropolitan areas of Sydney or Melbourne.<br /><br />We have a small town called Nimbin where drug sales/usage is overlooked. It&#039;s inland a little and on the border of two states (New South Wales &amp; Queensland). Every year there&#039;s an event called &#039;Mardigrass&#039; (a wordplay on our annual Sydney gay pride festival &#039;Mardi Gras&#039;) where the big joint float makes its appearance and there are competitions such as: Mens &amp; Women&#039;s Bongthrow, Blindfold &amp; Speed Joint Rolling...<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING: http://www.nimbinmardigrass.com/2013/<br /><br />Mushrooms, LSD and large amounts of Marijuana are available any time of the year.<br /><br />Every country has a spot...

I was very tired so my comment wasn&#039;t to the point either. Haha.<br />Making hash would be a great idea. There is huge demand for hash in Australia. When I had hash listed, it sold very fast.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been to Nimbin a couple of times. very interesting place! They have signs saying &quot;No dealing,&quot; yet I still got offered cannabis products more than 10 times in one day by people ranging in age age from about 12 - 60+. From what I saw, there is not many problems in Nimbin which shows that a town which thrives off weed seems to work OK.<br />For anyone wishing to go to Nimbin and buy weed to bring back home... BE CAREFUL! They regularly have road blocks and search cars outside of Nimbin. You would probably be better off buying weed in Nimbin and posting it back to your home. I&#039;m not trying to scare anyone, I&#039;m just warning that they do search cars sometimes, with the only reason being because you are leaving Nimbin.
