				PLEASE IGNORE--------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />I know i&#039;m an idiot for not keeping a larger stash for something like this...but i was placing an order right before all of this stuff happened so i&#039;d transferrred my btc to SR. now i&#039;m running out of drugs, the btc i do have - i can&#039;t get to and i don;t know anywhere to get dope in my area. i can&#039;t be the only one. y&#039;allare out there, right?!<br />i&#039;ve got a friend who can get me some a nice amount of cash tomorrrow to turn into btc. but i&#039;ve never bought on blacklisted loaded or whatever it is and i realllly don&#039;t want to. but i don&#039;t know what else to do. what are y&#039;all doing to get by? ideas? suggestions? ?<br /><br />helpful please...no trolling &quot;junkie-name calling&quot; please <br /><br />&lt;------------------------------------------------------------PLEASE IGNORE<br /><br /><br />feeling better thanks to a friend... to all of you in my previous spot, i hope the site opens up asap.<br /><br />motek, you don&#039;t know me... Karma is a friend of mine, in *real* life, I mean. and ya know, I looked back in my notebook.... you&#039;re right that i do owe .04btc - please expect double that once the site is back up... I have a bad memory that has nothing to do with drugs. Calling me out like that, instead of just PMing to remind me....it&#039;s just childish.<br /><br /><br />It&#039;s funny, I&#039;d think a website where everyone purports to be on drugs and/or the legalization of them,&nbsp; would be a nicer, happier, more positive place. Thanks to all of you who weren&#039;t spreading negativity throughout this thread.

				My philosophy is to accept what life provides. This is a chance to come off for a while and rethink life with different brain chemistry. I&#039;m still glad i got a stash of 3dames tramadol to mix with caffeine for euphoria and ease the come downs/back pain.

I highly recommend you come up with a backup plan when SR comes back up because every now and then SR goes does down for days on end out of nowhere (I was completely fucked back in November when SR was down for almost a week and it went down right as I was about to transfer payment to reup my stash).<br /><br />If you can&#039;t get anything at all, try ordering some Bali Kratom...it used to help my withdrawals out a lot (didn&#039;t take them all away because I had a huge habit BUT I was able to sleep and at least not go crazy).

				Man am I lucky then. I fucked off a month of fentanyl patches in a week. So then I ordered some fent from the road. I hope it gets here soon. Anyways, there is a park across the street and I watch the dealers do their thing and go. People dont sell on the street here, but the meet at the park after a phone call.<br /><br />Anyways, I walk up on one of the guys and tell him my situation and he hooks me up. 1/4 gram really about .20 or .15 even but they cost 20 bucks each. Now he is out so I am eating pills. Luckily I have several assorted remaining.

NO problems&quot; Coz motek ALWAYS pays their accounts ESPCIALLY when the other person has &#039;gone out of their way, to help you&#039;&nbsp; as my mate did about 1:45am monday morning when I woke him to ask IF he would &quot;help us out&quot; till we next caught up?<br /><br />What did he DO?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Why,&nbsp; He&nbsp; put a&nbsp; gram of fire gear in his letterbox and told me to come and get it,&nbsp; ;D 8)&nbsp; and pay him &quot;next time&quot;<br /><br />That&#039;s what You Need Saranottegan!&nbsp; &nbsp;Gee you have an appropriate user nym!<br /><br /><br />Wanna try &quot;hanging out BADLY&quot;&nbsp; ..... just get a prescribed 700mg per day morph habit for a few years .....and then get thrown in jail ,,,remanded.<br />&nbsp; 12 days of HELL, before they finally gave me 40mgs of methadone, coz I had to go to court, and I was&nbsp; still&nbsp; &#039;too sick&#039;<br />Now THAT was pretty gnarly, and we&#039;ve come off&nbsp; a &quot;gram a day&quot; of Pure #4 cold!&nbsp; Not nice BUT coming off the MSC was MUCH worse :o :(<br /><br />m m m motek&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />

				not sure where you are but if you can buy co-codamol over the counter, which is quite a common painkiller and do a cold water extraction to take away the paracetamol (acetaminophen), leaving you with just the codeine. Do it properly and you can take quite a few at once which should keep the sickness away until SR gets back up.<br /><br />I strongly advise that you do some research on cold water extraction as paracetamol can do some harm if taken in large quantities so you must get rid of that shit! Use a small amount of water and you will be fine.<br /><br />Good luck ;)<br /><br />

				i genuinely do not understand how a person could have a consistent dope habit (in which serious withdrawal would be experienced) just from buying on SR.&nbsp; that would take a shit load of money and a shit load of planning.&nbsp; &nbsp;this is coming from an ex-addict. <br /><br />OP - um, methadone clinic..?

The whole process here is what keeps me from getting out of control. <br /><br />The ones I dont&#039; understand are the supposed cancer/chronic pain patients who come on here for their meds. If you have a legit prescription, why the fuck would you come on here to pay for meds at 20x the price and hassle. If you can afford to pay for and maintain a habit like that through SR, you can afford multiple Docs.

				you can get a fair &#039;habit&#039; from a couple of grams of good dope used daily!&nbsp; &nbsp;TSR prices are cheap!&nbsp; <br /><br />Plan a bit and you can get yourself a healthy habit for a few hundred bucks a week...in motek&#039;s opinion fwiw<br />

So why would you want to have to deal with the hassle&nbsp; and prices to purchase items off of SR. If you can afford to maintain a habit via SR, you can afford health care.<br /><br />Now there is a big difference between opiate dependent and opiate addicted. It&#039;s the want to get high addicted person who is hitting up SR.

				@saranottegan Don&#039;t get mad at Motek for calling you out. Yes it may have been a little rude the way he went about it, but it&#039;s a lot more rude to not pay someone back when you said you would. I know you said you forgot and I&#039;m sure you probably did, but almost all of the people in the spare coins thread that don&#039;t pay back(which is a good amount) when reminded by someone always just say they forgot. When someone goes out of they way to help you, you should make it a priority to make sure you get them back. The person shouldn&#039;t have to remind you. With that said though, I do really think that you just forgot and I&#039;m happy to see you&#039;re going to put some more shapes back in motek&#039;s box.

I wasn&#039;t mad. I was way too busy being sick and sober. That combo can put most in a bad mood! So I start using attitude and being pedantic. <br /><br />I hope to be on here more loaning than borrowing. And buying less frequently!&nbsp; Oh, and Dan! I actually did loan AnnoymousAddict a little bit, which promptly paid me back for, plus a little extra I think :)&nbsp; You actually had me on a list where I&#039;d loaned - it felt GREAT!<br /><br />Havea great night, y&#039;all ;-)
