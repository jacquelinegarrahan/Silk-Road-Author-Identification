				First time trying speed (some of BoyWonder&#039;s stuff) and it is absolutely amazing! I felt like I&#039;ve always heard negative things about speed (not just from mainstream culture). This stuff seems like the perfect mix of energy and euphoria (almost like a mix of ectasy and cocaine). I guess I&#039;m rambling but holy shit this is gooooood. <br />Any comments?? ;D ;D ;D<br />I&#039;ve only taken 30mg and I&#039;m rockin

				You can be at least very functional on it unlike Coke. I am getting tired of the coke prices and the inconsistancy of said product. I don&#039;t get a comedown from meth (strongest amphetamine) if I stick to 20-30mg and eat well before , take vitamins during and look after myself. A good sleep aid goes a long way , very hard to sleep and I feel tired the next day but it is becoming a more viable option then coke. Take to much amphet though it takes to long to recover. Once it took me 7 days I was bed ridden completely for 5 of them.<br /><br />Oral route or smoking is the best. Intranasal leaves me to anxious and good effects don&#039;t last as long but the negative effects stay&nbsp; more prominent for much longer.

				Thanks for the reply!<br />I agree about coke - i always feel as though i&#039;m waiting for the moment to redose. It is also a hassle to always have to be going to the bathroom. And yea, the prices are just ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a little scared to try meth just because of the really bad stereotypes about it. How would you compare speed and meth?

				Only experience with speed is adderall (pharma amphetamine). Both are similar though meth is black market eg sides come with it , stomach problems when I use due to probable cuts in product and meth seems to last a bit longer. Adderall was cool and less sides. Sometimes I don&#039;t want to be high for 6 plus hours though hence why coke is a good option but coke is more then often cut with sometime of amphet.<br /><br />Speed is priced better and if dose is small and controlled you can function with out people knowing. How do you take your product? Orally imo has less sides , lasts longer , smoother comedown and body filters it to remove impuritys which is good for street drugs.<br /><br />I like ritalin to when taken orally the XR version. Though snorting ritalin gives horrible sides , anxiety , rapid heartbeat and just feels bad.

				Yea I&#039;ve taking Adderall before - this seems way more powerful. I&#039;m assuming meth is even more so. <br /><br />I took it orally using a capsule and it kicked in within 45 minutes. I&#039;m still feeling it pretty strong. According to BoyWonder, this is 96% pure and is extremely strong. Based on the reviews/comments, this seems true. Definitely worth a try. <br /><br />It seems like the dose I took, no one would notice at all. At higher dose, do you become a complete spastic case? Just wondering.

				high dose your pupils go huge , grind teeth , make needless phone calls , talk million miles an hour and make a fool out of yourself which makes the comedown bad knowing what you have done , lose weight due to loss of appetite , sweat. Never again. Smoking is good doesn&#039;t last as long and oral is good to but no more snorting and injecting it is silly. Bye bye vascular system if you shoot the substance in you and you can easily take to much and just be over stimulated which really makes the whole experience not pretty or pleasant at all.

				Good info. Would have given a +1 if I could. <br /><br />In your opinion, what is a &quot;large dose&quot; for someone who hasn&#039;t used the substance?

				Really depends on gender , weight , how often person in question uses other types of stimulants. Low dose amphet is good , comedown not as prominent and it is really productive. To high and you can;t go back while if you dose low you can gradually increase to get desired result but if you dose to high it is very noticeable to people around you.<br /><br />Also if you just started drugs and stimulants do not tell ANYONE what you do. People will judge and only negative things can come from saying what you do in your personal life. Trust me from experience. Also don&#039;t exercise on amphetamine. Recipe for only bad things.<br /><br />Always have some type of sleep aid to help with comedown , if you get some sleep and vitamins during comedown phase your body and mind will thank you so much.<br /><br />Taking amphet on a empty stomach also results in a better result. I just took mephedrone to help with cocaine comedown as it is fri morning here and I need something to get me through the day. I am getting over stimulants really and they really take a toll on your health.

				Also I started taking stims and drugs in general to help me with confidence with the opposite sex and being more extroverted then what I was. Due to inexperience and lack of knowledge it actually made things worse. Lost job , women distanced themselves further and family don&#039;t trust. Amazing how that can happen but it did and now I just have to deal with it and move on and try and redeem yourself in the best way you can. Hence why low dose stims is better then to much , to much people know and only bad things will happen.
