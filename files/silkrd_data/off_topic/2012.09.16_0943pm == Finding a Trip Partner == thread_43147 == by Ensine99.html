				I&#039;m interested in finding a new trip partner where I live.<br />How exactly should I go about doing this? Anyone do something similar?<br />I&#039;ve had two female trip partners in the past (and still do) but they live too far away for us to be together on most experiences.<br />When I say trip partner I mean kind of like friends w/ benefits, but during trips, I don&#039;t want a full blown relationship out of this.<br />In essence I&#039;m looking for someone to take chems with me (I&#039;d provide), Be naked around, touching, sex, and going on adventures outside/in. I feel like I have different needs depending on which chemical I&#039;m on (shrooms makes me want to lick people and walk around outside, 25c NBOMe makes me want sex, DOB/acid/MDMA makes me want to just be close to people)<br /><br />Any tips would be appreciated, I don&#039;t have problems talking to women, but I feel awkward trying to bring up this topic, given that a fair number of people I know consider psychs to be &quot;hard drugs&quot;

				i read on the news about people posting ads for that kinda stuff on craigslist. usually gay people use &quot;PnP&quot; or &quot;party and play&quot;... basically what you described but they do meth as i recal. If you want a heterosexual trip fuck-buddy, might be pretty hard to find lol.

				check the sex offender registry, they aren&#039;t all kiddy diddlers on that list, so you might just find what your looking for, and you know they don&#039;t care about breaking laws.

				yeah be wary of the fees tho. 300-500 a month usually. Make sure its greek + they have reputation for doing the drugs you&#039;re interested in, and that the sister sorority has a slutty streak so you don&#039;t get friendzoned as &quot;big bros&quot;/&quot;little bros&quot; nonsense.
