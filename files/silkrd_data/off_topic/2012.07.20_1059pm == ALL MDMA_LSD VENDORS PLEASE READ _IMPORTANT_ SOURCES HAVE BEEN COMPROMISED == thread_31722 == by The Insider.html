				Hello Silk Road,<br /><br />Hi I am a person who worked for a fairly large distribution supply chain for MDMA and LSD.<br />We did all our distribution online through private sources and supplied some SR vendors with product.<br />My boss&#039; were compromised by europol who is working with dea from what I&#039;m told. <br />I do not know much because I am just a low level employee who drops packages.<br />What I do know is that my boss is still supplying MDMA and LSD to people in the private scene.<br />I have one person still on the inside and they are telling me europol and the dea are working together to trap other suppliers.<br />They know my boss&#039; supply large vendors through out the deepweb and they are actively sending packages and catching these people. <br /><br />This is their only chance to catch some pretty big distributors and I shouldn&#039;t be posting this here but I feel I have to.<br />I do not have access to our work computer since this has happened and I can&#039;t access a lot of places I need to.<br />Please, spread the word this is serious and not a joking matter, people are getting in a lot of shit right now.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				It has been suspected for quite a while now that Umbrella is working with Europol. Dominatrix seems to be the member of this operation targeting SR vendors, he had a cute Freudian slip on the bulk LSD thread: &quot;I will be scooping up all the u.s. domestic vendors&quot;<br /><br />Call me a conspiracy theorist, call bullshit, I don&#039;t give a fuck.

				i think everyone knows who OP is referring to .. and this line of thinking has been circulating for a while. i would put my feelings on it at 75/25 that it is true. i dont think joot&#039;s problems came from them, i think FM had more to do with that.<br /><br />I cant tell though if the OP is saying the threat was comprimised as in captured and they assumed his identity or compromised as in he is working in coordination with LEO. I believe the 2nd part to be true, the first however no one could really know.<br /><br />i have spoken with an individual who articulated that the person in question deals with irritations in a unfathomable manner to people truly committed to the game.

				This is actually very interesting, when did this come about I&#039;d like to know who you&#039;re talking about exactly.&nbsp; Idk why you didn&#039;t drop any names so you&#039;re pretty much telling us to be paranoid over all vendors selling MDMA or LSD... o.O?<br /><br />I get our product from umb from time to time, not nearly all the time or on the regular she&#039;s far to inconsistant for that, and rest assured I&#039;m not &quot;Working together&quot; with her, after reading this thread it&#039;s put red flags in my head considering she hasn&#039;t been online in some weeks.<br /><br />Regardless it&#039;s illegal for europol or the fed to allow shipments through if that&#039;s what&#039;s been going on, just as the fed let the guns through to mexico something similar can happen with this I suppose, again they&#039;d be in for a hurting from media attention if it were to ever come up.&nbsp; Then again they could still not be playing by the rules.

				It would be really embarrassing for the DEA if they let through a couple Kilos of MDMA through knowingly and someone ended up dying. It would be a huge fuck up just like operation Need for Speed with ATF when the border patrol agent died. I know Dominatrix already mentioned this but it is a valid point. I read that link Shannon posted. They will let drugs through &quot;under the supervision of competent authorities&quot; &quot;controlled delivery has been used...for a long time already&quot;. They let drugs through, watch it closely, and bust the receiver. (AKA a CD) They will NOT allow you to receive your bulk order of drugs and watch you sell all of it to people.

				DEA/RCMP/Interpol certainly allow people to carry on selling drugs sometimes for YEARS to make cases. Look at the TFM bust, that was a 8 year investigation in which they watched the vendors on there exchange and sell drugs freely.<br /><br />As for outing the name of the suspected vendor ... it is a private vendor, so you know the name if you need to know the name. Its not for public speculation to be posted on SR.<br /><br />

				Reading the Willems Indictment they have info going back as far as 2005 in there. Indictments came in November, arrests in Mar/Apr. Does that mean they sat there since 2005 and watched it happen ? I doubt it ... but there was a prolonged period of time TFM was allowed to operate as normal while the DEA watched.<br /><br />You cant be serious saying the DEA etc dont allow drug dealing to continue to further investigations.<br /><br />edit - The investigation was carried out over 2 years.

				I don&#039;t feel like you always have to listen to someone with RL experience in something. Sometimes what you experience will be different than what I do in a similar situation and the experience you might give me might be irrelevant because states law differ from state to state. People just need to revert back to their common senses and remember we have to be proven guilty first. Half of the people here should take the time and sit down and read a few law books to gain a basic understanding of our judicial system.
