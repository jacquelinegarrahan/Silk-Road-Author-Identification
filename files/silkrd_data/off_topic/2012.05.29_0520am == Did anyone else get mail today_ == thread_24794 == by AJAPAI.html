I thought it was something that was just dreamed up in the last few years or something. Fair play in that case then, my bad, didn&#039;t know it was for them. I guess it&#039;s like our version of 11th of November where we have the 2 minutes silence in remembrance of WW1 and everyone since then. I totally get on that sort of thing, annoys me when people don&#039;t observe it. We don&#039;t get the day off though.&nbsp; :-\

				Not your fault bro. I jumped the gun a bit myself. Of course you weren&#039;t aware of the meaning of Memorial day. Why would you be aware of US holidays? I&nbsp; don&#039;t know a single British one, myself. <br /><br />The comment I should have been bashing was the one above yours, made by an American who should know better. Who&#039;s grandfather, or possibly great-grandfather, when really just a boy, likely willingly put his life on the line to do what had to be done on the other side of the world.<br /><br />By the way, I like your country&#039;s version better. Most Americans don&#039;t appreciate it for what it it is, they just get off work and still get paid. This makes no sense to me why we should be off work, especially without even thinking why. <br /><br />

Surely it&#039;s a day that should inspire work ethic especially given what they did? But hey, that&#039;s just me.

				Thread kind of made me sad a bit. When I was a kid, Memorial day was always going with my Grandma to put coverings on the graves of both of my Great Grandfathers who were veterans of WWII. Now I&#039;m rather numb to the holiday, and it&#039;s just a day off to me.

				Well now of course memorial day means nothing we live in a new generation but to people like my grandparents memorial day was a big deal u would go on huge family picnics and make american flags and face paint the towns would even have carnivals here. Its just now and even people like myself dont give recognition to our past soldiers and what not.

				That&#039;s exactly how I feel about it. None of those guys, from your country or mine took any days off. If they had all would have been lost. <br /><br />Can&#039;t imagine what that must have been like. V-1&#039;s and their loud ass pulsejets buzzing overhead, hearing the engine stall as it ran out of fuel, knowing that it may be one that that takes out your family. What&nbsp; a horrible way to wage war, bombing random women and children.<br /><br /><br />Gary, I think you owe the Army a good dick sucking. They are what keeps things like this from happening to us.<br /><br />BTW, I do realize, and am ashamed of the fact, that every war we have been involved in since Korea has been utter bullshit, the result of our corrupt government, and fueled by greed.

				We have a sort of memorial day too, but it&#039;s not a day holiday or anything. Just 2minute of silence at 20.00.. that&#039;s it. <br />Next day there&#039;s liberation day, which is a holiday once every 5 years.. <br /><br />Yesterday we did have a day off, but it was some Christian crap. Not complaining tho, I love a day off ;D
