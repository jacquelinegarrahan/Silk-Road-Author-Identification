				See tons of stuff on here I&#039;ve never tried (or heard of) but looks that all the personal growth-minded stuff is mixed with party-minded stuff! <br /><br />Will take time to go through Erowid to learn about the untested personal growth ones (like DMT) buuuttt.....<br /><br />Want to know y&#039;all&#039;s opinions on which party-minded goodies to stock up on? :D<br /><br />Already familiar with the old stand-bys, so already going with: <br />* LSD 5-10 hits min. (more growth than party, but like to have some on hand)<br />* schrooms 1-3g (same as LSD; more growth than party, but like to have some on hand)<br />* coke 1-3g<br />* weed 3-5g<br />* E 5-10 hits min.<br /><br />But for end of year festivities, what else should I stock up on and how much of each? Which to get first? <br />(think HS Thompson&#039;s briefcase here.. &quot;how &#039;bout some Ether!?&quot;) :)<br /><br />So what say all of you, experienced party people!? :P<br /><br />Update:<br />All great feedback people! Here&#039;s what caught my eye:<br /><br />Recommended:<br />* handful of benzos to come down (valium, xanax, clonazapam, etizolam)<br />* 2C-I- 1 gram<br />* 25c-nBOME- 5 500mcg hits<br />* 4-AcO-DMT- 1 gram (personal use; the &quot;spirit molecule&quot; isn&#039;t really party fun ha)<br />* Changa-1 gram (see above)<br />* Ketamine; not sure yet how much.<br />* Hash 2-3g (who doesn&#039;t love hash!?)<br /><br />I admit it; i lose track of all the Phikals &amp; Tikals... probably because i dont&#039; know them enough to love them yet haha.<br /><br />But if I can arrange for at least half of that, well 2012 will start with a bang! (and why not! haha)

				Although I&#039;m not a party person I would always suggest keeping some benzo&#039;s around (valium, xanax, clonazepam) just in case some of your guests go loco.

				I&#039;m in the same boat as you here, so I&#039;ll just post the list of what I&#039;m stocking up on :)<br /><br />LSD- 5 hits<br />2C-I- 1 gram (stocking up)<br />25c-nBOME- 5 500mcg hits<br />4-AcO-DMT- 1 gram (stocking up)<br />Changa-1 gram :)<br />MXE-1 gram<br />3 30mg IR oxycodone<br />MDMA- order from either juergen2001 or Dr. Amsterdam<br />Etizolam- LOTS of these, come in handy for everything, great benzo, check out PharmaKarma they have great prices<br /><br />This should keep my winter party season pretty well stocked. What is everyone else stocking up on? I hope this list gave you some ideas OP.

Sort of similar to MXE, but definitely a whole different beast. Most of what I have up there are psychs, which are my personal favorite :).<br /><br />Definitely stock up on benzos, though. They can come in handy for the comedown off of pretty much any drug. Etizolam!

				Last year I left it far too late and my contacts had all gone to visit family so this year with a month to go I have:<br /><br />1 oz nice homegrown, 1/2 oz Liberty caps, 1/4 oz golden teachers, 3g of some lovely mandy I&#039;ve recrystallised, 150mg 2C-B, some chunks of hash, 1g ketamine, <br />oh and booze- a box of westons organic, a bottle of hendrix gin and a crate of fever tree tonic water.<br /><br />And to smooth the experience: valium, temazepam, prochlorperazine for mushroom sickies, a big tub of 5-HTP, a packet of codeine and a tub of piracetam.<br /><br />And with 25 shopping days &#039;til Christmas- how organised am I?&nbsp; :D<br /><br />
