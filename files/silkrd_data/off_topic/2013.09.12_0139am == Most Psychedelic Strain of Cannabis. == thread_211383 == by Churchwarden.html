				Just thinking about some strains I must try and I would love to get the input of the collective knowledge of the road and find out which strange are the trippiest. I have gotten insanely high before and found myself hearing things, or just tripping out in general. Very high sativa strains usually, which are what I&#039;m looking for but for some reason people seem to lust after indicas? Maybe they&#039;re knockout power make people feel the strains are better value for money.<br /><br />So, which strains do you recommend for me to have the trippiest high from? <br /><br />(I know saying &#039;trippy high&#039; about weed makes me sound like an amateur to some but trust me, if you&#039;ve gotten totally blasted on the right stuff you now what I&#039;m talking about.}

				For a psychedelic sativa i would have to say Malana landrace (usually in the form of charas) and for a psychedelic indica i would suggest Pakistani. SpanishFly&#039;s Pakistani Premium is a great and mellow psychedelic smoke.

				LSD by Barney&#039;s Farm is one of my top contenders. it&#039;s a mainly indica cross of skunk #1 and mazar. it was named LSD due to its powerful stoney and trippy effects. some claim that LSD = Lemon Sour Diesel but that&#039;s just false, as Barney&#039;s Farm has stated.<br /><br />i grew one LSD plant about 2 years ago and it came out awesome. i wouldn&#039;t exactly call it a &quot;psychedelic&quot; high, but it did give a DIFFERENT kind of high that i haven&#039;t really found before in either heavy indicas or sativas. tolerance could have played a big part in it though. my tolerance is through the roof. i feel if a less experienced toker were to smoke actual quality LSD they would be absolutely blasted

				I have not tried it, but I have read that Neville&#039;s Haze has a spritual/trippy high.
