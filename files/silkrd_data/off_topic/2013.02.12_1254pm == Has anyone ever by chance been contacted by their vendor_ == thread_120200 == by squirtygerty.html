				I am fairly new to silk road. <br />But it got me thinking, has anyone ever ordered (domestic only) and been contacted and told the vendor actually lives close to them so they have offered to hand deliver instead of using SR?<br />This would be the biggest stroke of luck but imagine how great it would be.<br />If this has happened to someone please share your experiences!

				Yes the whole point of using this site is so you never have to meet these people.<br />It would certainly end with a new set of shiny bracelets<br /><br />It would never happen .&nbsp; Cops would love it though,

				hell no. if the vendor lived that close, were really stupid and reckless but wanted to save on postage they would just do it, not tell you first. for all they know they could be delivering to LE.

				Haha yeah I didn&#039;t really think that one through did I. I got told by someone that this happened to them however that could be a fabricated fairy tale story he was using to impress people as i understand now why it would never happen. The vendor does not benefit in any way.
