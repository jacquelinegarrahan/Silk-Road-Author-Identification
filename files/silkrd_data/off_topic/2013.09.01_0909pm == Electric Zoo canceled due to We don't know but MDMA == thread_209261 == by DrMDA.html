				So two people die at Electric Zoo forcing them to close the festival and their quote is &quot;We don&#039;t know why they died but it certainly was due to MDMA&quot;. I love it, they never do any toxicology reports, never do any blood work, they always declare deaths on MDMA based on a statement by one of their friends that they bought a green pill behind 7-11 that the dealer said was MDMA.

				My point is they take bath salts, speedballs, heroin, ect. and if they call it Ecstasy then all of a sudden MDMA is the killer. They always blame it on MDMA no matter what. If some dude shoots up 2 grams of China White and he just happens to be at a festival they will call it a MDMA related death. Total bullshit.

				I&#039;ve eaten 2 grams of molly at one time without knowing it thinking it was mescaline and nothing bad happened other than the fact of a nasty comedown and not being able to sleep for a day.&nbsp; Either way it felt like a 200mg roll.&nbsp; Anything eaten over 200mg still feels like 200mg to me.&nbsp; I also have to report some pretty bad drops in blood pressure, could not even stand up the next day without feeling dizzy, was pretty bedridden.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m waiting for some actual official information regarding what was taken. I swear, it isn&#039;t necessarily the drugs that are the problem - it&#039;s the lack of education surrounding them. <br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine the victims being proper 21+ years old and buying whatever drug happens to be at a festival, assuming it&#039;s exactly what they&#039;re told it is. Maybe that didn&#039;t even know what MDMA is and assumed it was safe no matter who it came from, what it looked like, how much appeared to be going into their mouth?<br /><br />My guess is it was two-fold: uneducated users, taking too much of a drug they did not research or test before consuming, and that it was not what they thought it was (probably an RC as speculated earlier in the thread).

				Yeah one of my mates was stupid enough to hide just over a gram under her tongue to sneak it into a club, she managed to swallow the whole thing waiting in the queue, someone took her back home and apparently she was just lying down with her eyes in the back on head making moaning noises, she had to have water thrown on her every so often to keep her temp down because she was sweating buckets. By the time we all got back she was still way fucked up and she said she was tripping pretty hard but having a good time haha. The day after her cognitive skills where almost non existent, <br />The LD/50 of MDMA is over 5.6g&#039;s at once. But obviously this doesn&#039;t take into account lack of fluids at time of consumption.<br />I&#039;m guessing it was PMA that shit has a stupidly high dose response curve and has killed a lot of people over here in the UK already.

				clearnet: http://gothamist.com/2013/09/02/woman_who_died_at_electric_zoo_repo.php<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">(Picture of smoking hot blonde and some guy in a sailor hat)<br /><br />On Friday and Saturday, two people died and four were hospitalized due to Ecstasy-related illnesses at the Electric Zoo electronic music festival on Randall&#039;s Island. The deaths of Olivia Rotondo, 20, a University of New Hampshire junior from North Providence, RI, and Jeffery Russ, 23, a Syracuse University graduate from Rochester, ultimately prompting officials to cancel the third day of the event. Both died of an overdose from MDMA, more specifically molly, a more concentrated form of the drug. The Post reports that on Saturday Rotondo told an EMS worker, “I just took six hits of Molly,’’ before collapsing in a seizure and dying.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hours before her death, Rotondo tweeted her excitement about attending the fifth annual Electric Zoo: “The amount of traveling I’ve done today is unreal. Just get me to the damn zoo.&quot; “She was the nicest girl I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing,” Noah Burkholz, a friend who had traveled to the festival with her, told the Times.Her grandfather Henry Rotondo, 73, told the Post, “She was a great kid — that’s all I can tell you.”<br />Police do not believe that Rotondo and Russ knew each other. Russ, who died early Saturday morning, graduated from Syracuse University last year with a degree in information technology. “Now there will be no grandchildren, no nieces, no nephews, no wedding,” Russ’ father, John Russ, told the Daily News. “Everything you look forward to in life is gone because of one pill.”<br /><br /><br />Police say that the four concertgoers who also became critically ill due to drug use are expected to recover. In addition to all that, a 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and 31 people were arrested for offenses including drug sales, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of controlled substances. Many criticized the lax security and the lack of medical staff; one concertgoer told us that it took several hours to get Russ from the festival to the hospital. “You saw a lot of people puking and collapsing down and laying on the ground,” 19-year-old Christopher Stuebbe told the Times.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />While some lashed out at Bloomberg and organizers for canceling events on Sunday, others defended the culture of the event. &quot;I don&#039;t think EDM culture promotes drug use at all. Young people are experimental by nature because they have no sense of their own mortality,&quot; Leslie Doyle, who has attended Electric Zoo festivals over the years and planned to go on Sunday, wrote us. &quot;Acts of violence would be a good reason to shut down a music festival, there was none of that! This administration reacted to 6 people who made unfortunate personal choices. Their decision to shut down EZoo has tarnished the experience for the collective group of tens of thousands.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;EZoo officials go to great lengths to make this an Eco friendly event, and the DJs make announcements advising people to take care of themselves,&quot; she added. &quot;There will always be a few people that lose control. Shutting down Zoo is one more example of the Bloomberg Administration&#039;s nannyism. When people die of alcohol poisoning, are they going to shut down the restaurants and bars who serve them?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Contact the author of this article or email tips@gothamist.com with further questions, comments or tips.<br />[/font][/color]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />There are people, drug dealers even -who cut drugs with weird shit (could be PMMA). Then there are are partiers who take 6 hits at once. That&#039;s a bad combination. <br /><br />For the first problem get a screening kit: <br />(again Clearnet) http://dancesafe.org/products/complete-screening-kit<br />(Somebody on SR please buy these in bulk and relist)<br /><br />For the second problem:<br />Don&#039;t take 6 hits at once unless you are familiar with the substance.<br />

				And this is why we should always advise people to buy testing kits.&nbsp; I highly doubt it was ~600mg of MDMA that killed her.&nbsp; And let&#039;s be honest if you&#039;re a girl then you should not be taking 6 pills of *anything* unless you&#039;ve tested it.<br /><br />I am in agreement with you guys that the news / media is jumping all over &quot;Molly&quot; when, of course, there haven&#039;t been any conclusive tests on exactly what was in her system.&nbsp; At least not from what I&#039;ve heard because I believe those types of tests occur during autopsy and take a bit of time before they reach a conclusion.

They seized cannabis, amphetamines, speed, ecstasy, MDMA, magic mushrooms, ice, cocaine, GBH &amp; crystal meth&quot;<br /><br />Speed is just another name for amphetamine and ice is another name for crystal meth and GHB is often written as GBH for some reason.<br />It&#039;d be good if they could at least write the article properly.

Most people I know are drug users too, or have used drugs in the past, but some people cannot be told. I have been labelled a junkie because I told them I took 1/3gm MDMA at a music festival. It&#039;s easier to not even bother arguing.<br /><br />Well drug use is becoming more and more socially acceptable IMO. People are far more open about drug use and I&#039;ve even see people advertise their drugs on facebook (Very stupid idea), or people updating their status to things like &quot;Can anyone get on?&quot; Then someone immediately says &quot;PM me.&quot; Very stupid to do this on FB, but it is becoming common
