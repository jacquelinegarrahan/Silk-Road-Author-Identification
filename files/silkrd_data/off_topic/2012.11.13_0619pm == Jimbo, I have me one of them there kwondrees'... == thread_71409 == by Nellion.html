				So, I place an order for 5g of mdma from a trusted vendor, and then cancel due to getting paranoid and the vendor shipping from NL.<br /><br />Well, I get over my paranoia and order 20mg of fentanyl from another trusted vendor from NL.<br /><br />It is about time for the fent to get here so I check my mail and see a package from NL, so I am pumped to get my fent.<br /><br />However, what lied inside was not my fent, it was a vacuum sealed package with the number 3 on the outside of it. I take out it and weigh it out and weighs out to 3.28g and had a slight bitter smell, not as much as good coke, but still bitter. It is also more grainy than coke, such as mdma is.<br /><br />However, what confuses me is why did I get mdma when I canceled my order and got my money back? And, why is not for the quantity I had ordered?<br /><br />Maybe the vendor took it upon himself to prove his shipping methods and send me 3 free grams of molly?<br /><br />Either way, I am a bit let down it isn&#039;t my fent, but am stoked I got some free mdma. However, am a bit confused as to why this happened, and feel that the vendor deserves some money.<br /><br />BUT, I am a bit reserved to putting something up my nose that I have no clue as to what it is. It looks like molly, but all molly I have seen is brown. The vendor I ordered from did say he acetone washed the mdma which would explain the whiteness and is originally why I ordered it in the first place.<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				Vendors aren&#039;t supposed to confirm an order until it&#039;s shipped. Sounds like you canceled while the molly man was at the post office.<br /><br />You beat him for it. The proper thing to do would be to square up with him. But that&#039;s on you.

				Well, you see, I honestly wasn&#039;t trying to scam him and he even sent me a confirmation message saying he canceled the order and I had nothing to worry about with his shipping.<br /><br />However, looking back on it my order was, in fact, for 3g...<br /><br />I just put me 50mg up the ol nariz and it definitely aint coke. Pretty&nbsp; sure it&#039;s molly. Hopefully it isn&#039;t too strong as I have shit to do here in a few, but the suspense was killing my ass.<br /><br />But yeah, as soon as SR gets back up I&#039;ll message up him and tell him what happened and give him his btc if he wants them. If I were a vendor I would hope someone would do the same for me.
