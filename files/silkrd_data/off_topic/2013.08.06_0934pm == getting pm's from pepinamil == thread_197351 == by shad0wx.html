				Yea I have gotten them. I just delete them. There is a setting in your forum profile where you can change whether you&nbsp; appear online to others or not. They send the spam from the list of members logged in on the bottom of the front page(per say)<br />

				I got two last night. It&#039;s a real vendor on SR - I just searched for his name on the market site and read his vendor profile page.<br /><br />He&#039;s just carrying out a bit of marketing by PMing people who are online, or maybe people who recently posted in the cocaine threads.

				Everyone go and report him as a vendor.<br /><br />Just look at his feedback. Everyone doesn&#039;t receive their stuff and some people actually FE. he probably never sends ANYTHING out and just makes bank of newbies
