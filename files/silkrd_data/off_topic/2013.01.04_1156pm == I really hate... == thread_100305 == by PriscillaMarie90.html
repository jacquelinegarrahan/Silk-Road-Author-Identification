				the Silk Road forums these days. I used to spend hours just skimming through the forums, reading all the interesting shit people had to say, the relevant review threads, ect. Now I might check the forum for 2 minutes every few days because every fucking board is spammed with threads like: &quot;$10 BTC WWW.BITCHAMP.COM ======[[[[[[[[!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BTC CHEAP RIGHT MEOW ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$10$10$10&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I am probably beating a dead horse here, but I felt like bitching so here it is. Fuck you, world.

				I bemoan the lack of depth of discourse taking place in the threads nowadays. It all seems very dumbed down now. Like eavesdropping on a group discussion in a boys dormitory after &#039;lights out&#039;.

				I&#039;m not too sour about the forums, I spent way too much time on here when I first joined anyway. What really ticks me off is that LSD is all but impossible to find and the prices for DMT have doubled since the MHRB crackdown.
