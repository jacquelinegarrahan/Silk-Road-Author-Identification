				I just received 25mg of Etizolam which I had hoped to weigh out on my scale into 0.5mg doses. I have one of those little pocket digital scale which does 300g/0.01g but I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s reliable enough. I put the little vac pack on (about size and weight of a postage stamp) and the scale reads 0.10g, then fluctuates down to 0.02g by itself&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Etizolam&#039;s normal dosage range is 0.5-2mg. I normally take 0.5mg pills. <br /><br />As weighing this stuff out into 0.5mg doses doesn&#039;t seem likely or safe on this cheapo scale.. I&#039;m gonna have to try liquid dosing but have no experience doing that. Am I correct in assuming that I can just add this 25mg to 10ml water in a dropper bottle.. and then after shaking well.. 0.2ml (not sure how many drops that will be?!) will provide a 0.5mg dose? This assumes of course that Etizolam is water soluble or at least evenly distributes when shaken..<br /><br />i.e. 25mg into 10ml / 50 (0.5mg) doses = 0.2ml <br /><br />On the plus side, looking at the LD50 (the legal dose) of Etizolam for mice, it&#039;s listed at 3,000mg/kg.. that would suggest this stuff is fairly low toxicity in terms of overdose if you really screwed up the dose... i.e, someone weighing 63.5kg such as myself, would need to consume 191g of Etizolam for a potential fatal overdose?<br /><br />Would appreciate any help/advice on how to handle this, don&#039;t want to take any chances :)

				Hmm.. it seems after doing a bit more research that Etizolam is not soluble in water and probably require a solvent to be liquid dosed safely.<br /><br />This post on another forum suggests that propylene glycol and ethanol would be a good solvent and the best way to find this is to get hold of some peppermint essential oil used for cooking/flavouring foods:<br /><br />http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=126508<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I tried 95% ethanol (everclear), bought some water color paper, calculated out the concentration with two drops (1mg/0.25&quot; square with a 30g needle and 1cc syringe)&nbsp; Practice with just the alcohol worked perfect.&nbsp; When I mixed the etizolam (100mg) it turned into a white slurry, which I did not think much of, but after about 10 drops the plunger froze/melted/stuck-would not move?&nbsp; Needless to say it was a $55 learning experience.&nbsp; I salvaged about 10mg of powder, but have not dared to do anything with it (The melting has me concerned)....plus my .001 -/+.005 scale has me concerned.&nbsp; <br />I would love to hear the best/easiest/SAFEST way to accurately dose 1mg/powder without buying a professional scale.&nbsp; &nbsp;
