I was being a child by going on saying i want to leave. Please stop making these dumb threads about conspiracy, and come on my thread and question my reality, because each person has to realize for themselves, and find the god in themselves. I am not the messiah, i am an atheist. Please have the balls to accept im questioning your reality. You have +82 karma and you have posted on each thread i have posted but your post on my thread says Lol wut, you understand? This is why i want to abuse and curse and leave. I am hear to stay, i am not high beacause today i have learnt to control it, in believeing that i was crazy in pouring out my story to you motherfuckers. Thank god, thank u, thank me, thank everyone.
