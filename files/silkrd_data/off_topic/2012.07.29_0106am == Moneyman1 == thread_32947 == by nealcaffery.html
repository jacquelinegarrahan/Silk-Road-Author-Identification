				After contacting moneyman1 and asking him if it would be possible to write a 1,000 word essay on Religion, he responded by asking to respond negotiating a price. After a few more messages back and forth – with me explaining that the report was due in a couple of days – he suddenly stated that he’d already finished the essay without concluding negotiations of a price at all. Regardless, I continued to message him in an attempt to negotiate a price. Due to time differences, the messaging was very slow and the due date was growing closer and closer. His communication was good; however it was extremely unprofessional and irritating. He would send multiple messages in response to my one, often typing in caps lock and questioning why I wasn’t responding (obviously due to time difference).<br /><br />After a few more messages, I received a message from a different user, explaining that moneyman1 had asked her to write a review regarding her experience with him. The review was overzealous about the quality of moneyman1’s writing skills and his “honesty and service”. After further communications, he then prompted me to send what I thought was an appropriate price for his service. I sent ~$35.00 worth of coins, which is what I thought was fair for the short essay. After receiving the coins, moneyman1 then stated ~$35.00 was not enough, and that I would have to send more. I replied, letting him know that I had no more funds and if he would like more coins he would have to wait a day or two for me to purchase more. The other option I gave him was to simply refund my coins, which he agreed to. Upon waiting for the coins to arrive, and sending another message, moneyman1 contradictory stated “no refunds”. After a couple more days of this back and forth nonsense, I eventually wrote the paper myself due to absolutely horrid communication.<br /><br />After a few more attempts at the return of my coins, moneyman1 accidentally sent a message from the account which had prior sent me a review of his service. Obviously showing that the ‘reviewer’ was actually moneyman1 himself, proving him to be fraudulent; pretending to be another user in an attempt to garner respect for his writing skills. He will no longer respond to my messages demanding the return of my money, and has stolen my Bitcoins.<br /><br />The bottom line is, please don’t waste your time and money with this unpleasant user. In the end, I’m glad I didn’t receive his essay as he types like an imbecile.

				Keep putting up new posts every couple days about how he is a scammer and what he did so other people will see it and it might save them from being scammed by him.
