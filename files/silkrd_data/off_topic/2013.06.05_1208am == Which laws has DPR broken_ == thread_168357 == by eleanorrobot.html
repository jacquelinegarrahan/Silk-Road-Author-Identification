				saw this on reddit a minute ago, thought it was an interesting discussion since i know zero about law... <br /><br />By creating this free marketplace, how has DPR broken the law? If he was caught, for example, what would be the charges used to take him down?<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING - http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1foown/which_laws_has_dpr_broken/<br />

				When in doubt they like to use income tax evasion because then all they have to prove is that there was untaxed income.&nbsp; They&#039;d also try to get him on drug charges like conspiracy to sell drugs, but DPR could argue he never did any transactions himself and never had intent for any specific transaction by SR users.

				Ah, but Silk Road isn&#039;t free.&nbsp; DPR takes a percentage of every transaction made, and thus receives income derived from violations of the Controlled Substance Act.&nbsp; If he&#039;s in the US, it would be a pretty cut and dried conspiracy case. Conspiracy just involves &quot;participating in an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime such as selling or transporting drugs&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if DPR is not directly selling anything illegal, he&#039;s quite clearly profiting from such sales, and he is obviously knowledgeable about what gets sold in the marketplace he runs. Even without the marketplace itself coming into it, the fact that DPR gets a part of the take from every transaction made on SR is enough to make him a &quot;conspirator&quot; in every instance of trafficking on the site.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also: <br /><br />&quot;It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter punishable by imprisonment for more than one year in which such person has participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2 of Title 18 to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce.&quot;<br /><br />So if he&#039;s cashed out even one Bitcoin he&#039;d be guilty of the above as well.&nbsp; If he gets caught, I think tax evasion, unfortunately, would be the least of his worries.&nbsp; I hope for his sake he long ago moved to a country with no US extradition treaty.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />

				Different countries have different laws, but in the U.S. they have RICO statutes they could pin on DRP. They can charge him with running a criminal enterprise.

Tor is just now working on a 2048-bit encryption scheme. <br /><br />It took a bunch of elite number theorists to recently break 768-bit encryption of a text file; at the moment, we don&#039;t have computers powerful enough for it.&nbsp; Not to mention, he(they) probably change identities every now and again. They&#039;d have to decrypt every single peice of info on the way to his node.<br /><br />Maybe when quantum computers come out, but the gov&#039;t seems to be having a hard time containing encryption paradigms from the general public because the companies can make a bigger profit on selling it to private companies.&nbsp; Look at truecrypt...<br /><br />If anything, they&#039;re just hoping he logs on his account un-Tor&#039;ed or gets busted for something else, leading them to discover the servers.&nbsp; One of the inventors of Tor said this is basically the only way given current technology.

Well besides that there are other ways to locate hidden services but I&#039;m no expert but I&#039;m sure someone with the right amount of motivation, knowledge, and unlimited funds anything is possible but I guess let&#039;s not give em a reason eh :P

				Well, SR is fucking good idea. And it&#039;s not bad for the government at all. It have potential to end heavy armored gangs, and cartels and shit. <br /><br />This is free market man. You won&#039;t get costumers by having your territory or by being the only source around, you will get costumers for you price and reputation. Think how awesome is that, and how good can this make to society.

				Didn&#039;t take the time to read the whole thread but &quot;Which laws has DPR broken?&quot; is just a hypothetical question.&nbsp; If the identity of DPR was found and powerful politicians wanted him behind bars... he would almost certainly end up behind bars.<br /><br />Keep in mind that judges typically favor the prosecution in general with the exception of cases that have a lot of publicity.

				With crypto. We need to be a bit cautious before making statements such as &quot;1024 has never been broken&quot;<br /><br />It is a fact that NSA and IBM have worked/possibly still work together, hire the BEST cryptoanalyst, mathematicians and securities professionals to build advanced crypto methods and decrypt, or at least attempt to decrypt all current publicly available methods. There are a few crypto methods that aren&#039;t even made public. I even have a sneaking suspicion that most (read MOST, not ALL) crypto methods are only available to the public when agencies like NSA or CIA have found a way around the algorithms and can decrypt them successfully<br /><br />There is constant research done on these by these HUGE organizations for their own purposes with the best equipment and top minds. I think we as a community should also research our own methods, and keep them as private as possible. I would assume this is what DPR has done, which has made him/her/them so successful.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen many a people here who are very knowledgeable when it comes to computer security and crypto and I think we should develop an ongoing project that would be for this community

				I&#039;m sure this has already been mentioned, but, profiting from a continuing criminal enterprise... I figured this would be pretty obvious. <br /><br />He&#039;s basically not only the head of this organization, but is profiting obscene amounts of money from it. Even if he hasn&#039;t sold any drugs himself.
