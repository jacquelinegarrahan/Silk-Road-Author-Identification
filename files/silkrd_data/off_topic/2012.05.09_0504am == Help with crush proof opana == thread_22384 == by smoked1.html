				I have a friend that uses opana, and here is how he does it.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s the same crush-proof mechanism though, so take this with a grain of salt. <br /><br />He takes a small, flat, and sharp tool (like one of those mini flathead screwdrivers) and meticulously takes off the outside coating.&nbsp; He tries to make sure as much as the inner pill is left over while still taking off the entire outside.&nbsp; After that is done, he crushes it like normally.&nbsp; He also mentioned that he uses a pedi-egg, although I&#039;m not really sure what for and what it does.&nbsp;

				Yeah be careful, 120mg is a high tolerance id&#039; say. I have a friend who ate em often and would only eat max of 80mg, but said he could do more. I&#039;d start low, around 20-30mg if you take them normally, give it an hour or two to see how well you do.&nbsp; If i&#039;m correct OP (oxy purdue) are uncrushable/unsniffable. As SOON as they touch any moisture they congeal, and turn gummy. Even if you crush them (picture on the net somewhere) they turn to a mess. Your best bet and bioavailability is to just swallow them as prescribed. <br /><br />If Opana is another oxy/perc then ignore this message...&nbsp; 8)

				If you have no real opiate tolerance, than start with &lt;5mg. They pack a serious punch, especially if you&#039;re planning on snorting them rather than just swallowing. You can always take more later if you decide you can handle it. <br /><br />120mg is crazy. Hopefully that poster was just confusing it with another substance.

				I just hope that somebody doesn&#039;t stumble across it and take the advice without reading on. I think 120mg could even kill someone with a high tolerance. I think you are right.. I will start with 5MG if I can get it to powder form. I&#039;m not sure how much to take if I can&#039;t beat the time release. Maybe I&#039;ll take more and just let the time release keep me high for 12 hours. :)

				There are a couple different ways.... The easiest is a 12-16 hr soak in bacteriostatic water and than sucked through filter and IV&#039;s Up the Nose Plugged or Down the hatch...... Since the smush like a skittle its useless to try to crush i believe. Oxymorphone(opana) is 1.8-2 x stronger than oxycodone

				I think 5mg would honestly be more than enough for someone with no tolerance. I have no idea what everyone else on here is thinking. Opana is serious shit. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend taking a look at the second page of the Opiate Conversion thread in the Drug Safety section, found here: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=900.15<br /><br />It&#039;s basically just a few other people weighing in on your dosing question. Hopefully this helps. Be careful. I think you&#039;ll feel prettttty great even with a relatively small starting dose.&nbsp; &nbsp;:)

				Needle nose pliars and a new ped egg. This is how I grind the new oxy op and opana. Then plugg or snort. Plugging really is better than snort or iv with opana since the onset is slower anyway.

				a few months ago, i got a 20mg opana.&nbsp; i took a sharp knife, and cut away the coating.&nbsp; i ate it, just to make sure i got all that was still stuck to it.&nbsp; then i put it inside a pill crusher.&nbsp; that smashed it up pretty good.&nbsp; after a few grinds, it was snortable.&nbsp; but it wasn&#039;t as strong as i expected.&nbsp; now, at the time, i was snorting 90mg of roxy to get started, usually ended up doing 150mg of the roxys by the end of the night.&nbsp; so i under estimated how strong the opana would be.&nbsp; i really didn&#039;t get much more than a slight head change.&nbsp; but, i&#039;ve been off opiates for some time now, so maybe it would give me a buzz if i tried again.&nbsp; who knows.&nbsp; opiate tolerance doesn&#039;t seem to decline much for me, even when i stay off them for months.&nbsp; so i just don&#039;t do them much anymore.&nbsp; i don&#039;t like them enough to develop a dependency on them again.&nbsp; one bout of withdrawls was enough for me.&nbsp; now i just indulge a few times a year.&nbsp; <br /><br />whatever you decide, just be safe, and remember:&nbsp; everything in moderation.

				I hope your not buying those roxys on sr :p. Even so roxys on the streets are kind of expensive. but if you have&nbsp; script then FOSHO haha 8)<br /><br />heroin is the only way to go, and IV if you really want to get high for a long time. Obviously i&#039;m not forcing anyone, but it is the best way and is very easy. After 5 times I was a pro. My viens are pretty easy tho. But I do it for people now and They say they never feel a thing(until I press the plunger lol)<br /><br />fuck Opana&#039;s. Only do Hatters solution if you want to get high. Like only 10% get&#039;s used when ate and 30-40% when snorted! Damn.<br /><br />But if you get 80mg opanas for 10 bucks then eat two fosho! haha :p<br /><br />That&#039;s moderation right there 8)

				80mg opana for 10 bucks?&nbsp; that&#039;s mad love.&nbsp; i know assclowns that will pay 2 bucks a mg for them.&nbsp; i&#039;ve never bought opiates off SR.&nbsp; the prices are too high for my blood.&nbsp; i&#039;ve thought about trying some good snortable h, but it&#039;s all expensive as fuck too.&nbsp; i just can&#039;t bring myself to taking the plunge.&nbsp; needles just aren&#039;t for me, unless it&#039;s ink or giving myself a new piercing.&nbsp;
