				Hello, I&#039;m windmillz name says It, pretty free flowing down to earth guy. I just recently found out about the SR through a couple buddies of mine so I&#039;m fresh and new to everything so vets on here I do apologize for anything noobie I might do. I am doing my upmost best to read previous posts! Just the thought of this strong network of people thrills me. Makes your heart quicken and make everything look greener outside if ya know what I mean. I love mary jane, everything that you can do and create with something so simple as a plant, and all the different strains it can produce. I&#039;m studying for a computer science degree, first starting out with CIT. I feel like this world needs to change the way we look at &quot;drugs&quot; for people have cataglorized many things, I just feel everyone has to make a decision for themselves, leaving other people to what they please, and not judge, for who says whats right and wrong.... I look forward to a great experience, and smooth transactions on the SR I see so many great things! <br /><br />ps Props to the reliable MDMA vendors with top notch stuff great times thanks to you!!!<br /><br />windmillz

				Welcome! I&#039;m new here too. I came here because it is much too unsafe and risky to buy marijuana here in the south (GA). So far, I really enjoy this place. There are many helpful and insightful people here. Again, Welcome to SR! :D

				Thanks g01d3n appreciate it, sounds like you have reached a couple steps further in than I have, so ready for this adventure!&nbsp; I understand your worry about safety in getting your products! Thats one of the reasons I have seeked this amazing community out! I do want to apologize for the mis-placement of this thread, I was logged out when the time limit was over, and when I logged back in I was not paying the attention I should have been while posting this. I hope It has not offended anyone my apologizes!!<br />
