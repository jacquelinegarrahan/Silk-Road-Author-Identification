				that&#039;s considered a binge?<br /><br />My last drug binge was about 4 years ago which consisted of this.<br /><br />thursday-tuesday so 5 days.<br /><br />35 orange apple x pills - I&#039;m pretty sure it was methylone now that i look back on it, if it even existed then, idk but that&#039;s the first time i was able to eat pills for more then 2-3 days like that.<br />a script of oc 40&#039;s - I had about 25 left<br />roxy 30&#039;s - 10 or more<br />xanax - was eating them like candy for the whole 5 days no idea how many<br />weed- was smoking the whole time probably went through a ounce <br />meth- had a few lines somewhere through out the 5 days<br /><br />I&#039;m sure I did more shit then I have listed but that&#039;s what I clearly remember.This was one of the wildest time I&#039;ve had and after the 5 days I felt like shit for about a whole fucking week.

				My biggest binge ever was at a music festival a few years ago. It was one of the funniest weekends of my life and it involved, what felt like, copious amounts of everything.<br />The below figures are rough guesses. In the words of the great Hunter S Thompson, &quot;I don&#039;t advocate excessive drug use, but it has always worked for me&quot; ;)<br /><br />3 - 4 Dalai Lama acid trips<br />3g MDMA<br />3g Coke<br />1g Ketamine<br />1g Mephedrone<br />15- 20 XTC pills<br />Slab of beer<br />Bottle of whiskey<br />Numerous edibles.<br /><br />No joke, I wasn&#039;t fully recovered from that for at least 2 weeks. I didn&#039;t touch a drug for a good few months after that ridiculous binge!<br />

				when I was addicted to K I did about 4-7 vials a day that lasted about 2 months which I guess is like a mega binge. Also when I was young, younger than 16 and was first introduced to coke I did a large quantity of washed cocaine one night and ended up in a hospital, the doctor told me I did enough to kill a large mammal, not sure how much it was exactly but I would guess around 3.5 grams.<br />I don&#039;t really use hard drugs that anymore, just vape trees daily :)

				Jesus Christ people! <br /><br />Apart from the effects of a good hero dose, binging on chems isn&#039;t really worth it. Your brain runs out of the neurotransmitters the drugs effect, or the receptors are full / downregulating.. so you get diminishing returns. Then you just get grindy and mashy and weird. <br /><br />A better way to have a long trip is to take one drug at a time in sequence, but make sure they don&#039;t all demand the same brain resources, so you move from one to the other. (Anyone else do this?)<br /><br />The binges you guys are talking about just seem like a waste of good product! <br /><br />But damn.. hah. You guys are nuts. :)

				I was once sedated for over four days, for medical reasons. When they brought me out of it I&#039;d lost one and a half stone, my tongue was numb, I couldn&#039;t walk and I didn&#039;t have a fucking clue what was going on for about half an hour. The worst part was I must have been helped to the toilet in that time, and the nurses had changed my clothes about ten times! :o<br /><br />EDIT: Not really a binge though, but it was a awful lot of drugs.

Of course i murdered the entire thing, and i was literally glued to the couch all day, just watching the sun go down. At like 10p i was like shit i gotta go home lol. <br /><br />Although I do have a friend who is a thc afficionado, maybe for his birthday comin up I&#039;ll buy one of your variety packs for him.

				Ive binged on every drug that ive ever tried. Its the only way to really experience the drugs true effects IMO. I mean how else are you supposed to know what your limits are until you get right to the very edge of your existence? Ill share one story that stands out the most to me ATM.<br /><br />I got out of work at 1am on a Friday night and had to be at work Sat afternoon. I had an eightball of coke and a bottle of vodka. FUCK SLEEP! I sniffed over 2 grams that night and drank the bottle of vodka. Got to work a little early and was feeling pretty shitty, so i bought a 6 pack of budweiser and chugged all 6 beers in less than 10 minutes and headed into work. About an hour into work i started feeling shitty again so i decided to take a xanax to calm myself down. I dont remember what happened for the next 12 hours or so, but when i woke up i was home and naked and my apartment was wrecked. Come to find out i was stumbling around and talking to myself at work. A good friend of mine covered for me and told me to go home. Told the bosses i was violently sick and had to go asap. I somehow made it home and also consumed the rest of the xanax stash i had. Thankfully i didnt die because i guess at some point i called my Heroin dealer and bought some stamp bags and did them in combination with the xanax coke and alcohol. <br /><br />That was just one crazy weekend out of many many binges in my lifetime. I must have someone watching over me, because ive done enough drugs to kill a normal person more times than i can count. <br /><br />

You will do evil irresponsible things. This is an old story. <br /><br />I&#039;m debating on whether or not this is a good experience. I met a woman off Craigslist last year. I posted an ad for cuddling, and she was pretty attractive. We cuddled, and she went on her way. We hung out the next day and I happened to have some Xanax and Klonopin, and very little experience with both. I&#039;d say we had a massive benzo overdose. All I could recall are blurs and a tattoo she had on her stomach.<br /><br />I awoke the next morning, naked, dick stuck to the carpet, as if I were crawling toward something, with the headache feeling that can only accompany a blackout, or being hit with a bag full of hammers. I was alone, frightened and confused. My wallet was missing, and an episode of Weeds was looping on the television. Was I raped? Did a woman drug me, and have some lumberjack fuck me in the ass and rob me or something?<br /><br />I scrambled to my feet, got dressed and grabbed my gun. Around this time I had noticed I was missing two Viagra and half a bottle of Xanax. I was searching the house for invisible ninjas and inspecting the integrity of my butthole, when I decided to check outside for signs of a struggle, or a clue of some sort. There I happened upon the woman, asleep in her car with her pants on backwards in the July heat. I knocked on her car window and re-introduced myself.<br /><br />We went inside and started piecing together the nights events, like a scene from the Hangover. She said she felt as if she was repeatedly punched in the vagina, so I came forward and stated we likely had Xanax and Viagra sex all night and she left me to my own devices, naked and sticky, with the door open for anyone to stumble across me. I then said, &quot;since we definitely had sex, and don&#039;t remember it, we should have sex now so we DO remember it.&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t know how that worked, but we were inseparable for a few months after that. In those following months I realized that she was indeed a whore, and a piece of shit. I found her on a few dating sites and she had an estranged husband at the time. She up and left one day and I haven&#039;t heard from her since. I&#039;m a bit cynical about it, but I take solace in knowing she is just a run of the mill Craigslist whore and a wreck of a woman, and she isn&#039;t worth my time or emotional attachment. After six months and not committing to a relationship I didn&#039;t attempt to get her back. I&#039;ve been single ever since.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get a girlfriend off Craigslist.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />That&#039;s one hell of an story and an experience, one that I hope to never have.&nbsp; Thanks for the share. :o

				I&#039;d just split from my woman and just harvested a field of weed,&nbsp; I was wandering in a daze around the WOMAD festival and stopped to check out Lucky Dube, a South African reggae star. A guy in front of me was sticking papers together and i leaned over and poured a pile of weed in his spliff :) It turned out he&#039;d climbed the fence to give out flyers for a free festie in France, live bands and sounds systems :) :)<br />I went back to Cornwall and spent a month on the moors collecting mushrooms and talked a few dealer friends into meeting me in France for a bender :)<br />I set off for France&nbsp; with a nice holiday stash of weed, mushrooms, acid, speed and charlie :)<br />I arrived 2 days later in an amphetamine haze and wandered around looking for my mates, i just got to the main stage still under construction and a guy leapt down and rushed over shouting &quot;you came, you came &quot; it was the guy i&#039; got the flyer from in England :)<br />First thing he asked me was had i brought any smoke as the whole site was dry, french police had busted a couple of the sound systems and taken loads of dope. I gave him some weed and he promised to get me some mdma when it arrived later. I found my mates and they&#039;d brought a caravan and sited it right on the busiest junction between two fields, they were all totally trollied on Tequila and coke when i arrived but i soon caught up :)<br />The caravan soon became a hub of trading as people discovered we had a variety of consumables and we discovered that the french will throw money at you for drugs, especially the magic mushrooms and acid :)<br />Then matey found me again and gave me a little bag of mdma, which we immediately snorted and then we all had a couple of tabs to get the party going :)<br />My memory gets rather fragmented at this point :) flashes that i recall include a competition to see who could take the most drugs in one morning, swapping a big bag of mushrooms for a massive bag of money, a cess pit appearing in front of the live stage, mad gabba music and bagpipes at daybreak with mist rising everywhere. We made a deal with a traveller cafe to provide us with fresh coffee at any time in return for some speed and at one point we had to write a menu of our wares because we couldn&#039;t talk coherently. it became a mission to find more mud (that was the slang name for mdma back then, getting muddy was a good description of our weekends stomping around in fields) and when a guy asked if we were interested in trading for some we almost kidnapped him getting him back to the caravan.<br />We took more drugs that week than most people see in a lifetime :)<br />Arrived home totally broke and had to stop off at a friends house en route to borrow some petrol money for the last few miles :)<br />

				^ good god man. That is a full blown drug expedition!&nbsp; Like Hunter S. Thompson says....&quot;when you pile up a drug collection this extensive, the tendency is to push it as far as it can go...&quot;

Its the only way to really experience the drugs true effects IMO. I mean how else are you supposed to know what your limits are until you get right to the very edge of your existence? Ill share one story that stands out the most to me ATM.<br /><br />I got out of work at 1am on a Friday night and had to be at work Sat afternoon. I had an eightball of coke and a bottle of vodka. FUCK SLEEP! I sniffed over 2 grams that night and drank the bottle of vodka. Got to work a little early and was feeling pretty shitty, so i bought a 6 pack of budweiser and chugged all 6 beers in less than 10 minutes and headed into work. About an hour into work i started feeling shitty again so i decided to take a xanax to calm myself down. I dont remember what happened for the next 12 hours or so, but when i woke up i was home and naked and my apartment was wrecked. Come to find out i was stumbling around and talking to myself at work. A good friend of mine covered for me and told me to go home. Told the bosses i was violently sick and had to go asap. I somehow made it home and also consumed the rest of the xanax stash i had. Thankfully i didnt die because i guess at some point i called my Heroin dealer and bought some stamp bags and did them in combination with the xanax coke and alcohol. <br /><br />That was just one crazy weekend out of many many binges in my lifetime. I must have someone watching over me, because ive done enough drugs to kill a normal person more times than i can count. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Joeyjojor, I particularly enjoy the fact that you attended work during this binge and can&#039;t recall what happened there. For me this is what marks this out as a true binge. I once got sacked from a job for biting a waitress; an act which I have no recollection of.... I think I was attracted to her and in my addled state was trying to woo her ( she was married.)

				OK, so my binge seems a bit lightweight compared to some. Maybe I&#039;m just a cautious chappy at heart - or maybe I instinctively knew that no matter how much more I took, my serotonin had been fully depleted and therefore taking any more would just have been a waste. I suspect the latter. <br /><br />Reading some of the accounts of others&#039; binges I&#039;m wondering why you guys are still walking the earth. Some of them sound reckless to say the least.
