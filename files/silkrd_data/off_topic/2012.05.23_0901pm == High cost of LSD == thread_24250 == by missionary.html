				I notice that here a single hit of acid is going for about $25. That&#039;s about 15 bucks more a hit than I&#039;ve ever paid at a club or on the street. Any ideas on why it&#039;s gotten so expensive?

I say &quot;we buy&quot; as in the LSD enthusiasts; I however stock up on a sheet whenever a trusted vendor stocks them for reasonable prices.

				It&#039;d probably be a bunch of misc. stuff.&nbsp; Some weed products, for sure.&nbsp; I can get hash and misc. marijuana products for a good price around here.&nbsp; Especially this liquid THC I get.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like anything listed on here.&nbsp; MDMA is possible, LSD (sometimes.&nbsp; Not always consistent).&nbsp; Maybe even some mushrooms if I start growing again!&nbsp; It just all depends.&nbsp; Pretty much, I&#039;m preparing for if and when I lose my job.&nbsp; If I lose my job, I&#039;m selling on here full time.<br /><br />There&#039;s also a very decent chunk of research chemicals I can get my hands on for a good price, but I haven&#039;t really dabbled with them too much yet.<br /><br />Idk, tho.&nbsp; We will just have to see.&nbsp; I once had an interested of putting mints up here.

				It just all depends, in all honesty.&nbsp; I have a few hook ups.&nbsp; One that isn&#039;t very consistent, and the other who is.&nbsp; The other who is gets large quantities of blotter, and sells them to me for 500 a sheet.&nbsp; Price drops if I were to buy a couple at a time.&nbsp; The main issue is it mostly has to be cash up front, or else I&#039;d only have 2 days to get the money back to him.&nbsp; The pages disappear in like a day or two easy.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably do 80 dollar strips at first (AFTER SILK ROAD TAXES), and if I were to get multiple sheets, I&#039;d probably get my price dropped to 400 a sheet, so I&#039;d sell them for 500 I think.&nbsp; But don&#039;t go buy this yet.&nbsp; I really haven&#039;t decided if I want to do this yet.&nbsp; Seems like a ton of work, and if it ended up being LSD, I gotta make sure I have a supply to meet the demand.&nbsp; I&#039;d rather be consistent and not have my stock fluctuate.

				i used to buy a bible for a grand.&nbsp; 25 a hit is like getting assraped by a gang of homless people.&nbsp; i would rather do rc&#039;s, than pay more than $400 a sheet.&nbsp; and that&#039;s just because of the shitty economy.&nbsp; everything has gone up.&nbsp; i would give the 4 for a sheet, and shake the hand of the person who remembers what the 60s and 70s were about in the first place.&nbsp; it breaks my heart that capitalism has infected psychedelics.
