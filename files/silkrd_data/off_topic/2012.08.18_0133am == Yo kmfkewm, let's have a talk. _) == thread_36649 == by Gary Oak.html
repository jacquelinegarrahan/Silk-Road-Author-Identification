				oh don&#039;t start up again, we were just getting past it brah.&nbsp; We were all just enjoying talking about fat angry teen age bitches and orgies between hate groups that get chronicled on maury.<br /><br />&nbsp; To kmf, for me the idea that all of my intelligence(not that much) could be genetic and that I might have just gotten lucky not to be a mindless dumb ass is really humbling, not something that makes me call everyone else names.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; In the end if you realize that the ignorance and flaws of other people are primarily enforced by massive walls of fear, panic, and all of the things that your own ego can use against you then I think you should pity people for those things rather than act condescending.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve had a bad trip before then what you were seeing was pretty much your own ego attempting to protect itself by erecting those walls of fear and anxiety, these things are terrifying to face and I don&#039;t blame most people for not wanting to face them.&nbsp;

				So it is actually true that in very many (but not all) of the cases on to catch a predator, the people arrested would have broken no laws had they been in a country such as Canada or Netherlands, and in some of the saddest cases the difference between being a sexual predator and normal is only a few miles to a state line, since federal age of consent in USA is 16 with some states having higher but none lower.

				just for the record I actually do not jerk off to children , pretty much the youngest I find anyone to be sexually attractive is around 14 , and do not even consider myself to be particularly oriented towards ages below what is legal in my country. So I support people being free to jack off to whatever, and in a fair world I would say 15 is appropriate for age of consent although certainly some below that are fully developed physically. I also find the vast vast majority of CP to make me feel very sad and disgusted and I would entirely avoid it if possible, which it generally is :). I would also never harm someone for my own pleasure, even if I felt a desire to.<br /><br />now I feel that I really must be off though I feel as if I have spent over the past 24 hours arguing on SR about CP and that makes me feel somewhat like I have wasted a lot of time actually. <br /><br />was fun as always , ciaoz (4 reals this time lololol)

Both of them are over the legal age of consent. It is PERFECTLY LEGAL for them to engage in sexual activity. At the same time, it is HIGHLY ILLEGAL for them to document their perfectly legal activities in any way, shape, or form. If the girl wrote about her sexual activity in her diary, and it were to be discovered, she could potentially have faced prosecution for both making and possessing child pornography. <br /><br />No person (at least in their right mind)&nbsp; approves of child abuse. Our various governments have today, over-reacted, criminalizing even descriptions of underage sexual activity. This is like putting a band-aid (plaster) on a gangrenous wound.

And i mean ANYTHING...and that doesn&#039;t make you a bad. But when your start acting out your fantasizes, you crossed the line. And i don&#039;t mean dressing up in a clown outfit and getting spanked.....I mean the really deprived fantasies one will have in the darkest part in his mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;We all have them just keep them there...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I guess the debate comes down to, is anonymously looking at pictures keeping a fantasy to yourself. I think that it is.

				&nbsp; I have thought about it a bit and I agree with kmf.&nbsp; Watching a video harms no one, and this is true no matter what is contained in that video or how repulsive it is.&nbsp; Arguing that having these videos will somehow make a pedophile more likely to act in the ways depicted in the videos is illogical.&nbsp; Would you want sex less if you didn&#039;t watch porn?&nbsp; probably not.&nbsp; Do people become more violent if they watch violent videos or play violent video games?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Saying that it creates a larger supply and demand to watch those videos also makes no sense.&nbsp; I highly doubt most pedophiles pay for their child porn.&nbsp; So are pedophiles just the one altruistic community on the planet?&nbsp; Doing it for the fans?<br /><br />&nbsp; In the end such activity is protected by a person&#039;s right to pursue happiness as long as it doesn&#039;t harm anyone else.&nbsp; Creating those videos should obviously be punished though.&nbsp; Anyway, videos of violence or disgusting pornography are every bit as vile to me as cp.&nbsp; I find it especially funny that vinny was railing at everyone even though he&#039;s posted about all of the violent videos he has watched in the past, shouldn&#039;t you be arrested for watching a snuff video?<br /><br />&nbsp; I see no difference between a pedophile jacking off to a clothed girl and one jacking off to a nude one as long as they don&#039;t harm anyone else.&nbsp;

				i still find it so simply pathetic and distasteful that everyone is still on here attacking kmf.<br /><br />we&#039;re here FIGHTING for our FREEDOM... but yet everyone else is SO QUICK to get pissed at someone else for their beliefs.<br /><br />i mean seriously.. it&#039;s like me judging everyone for shooting up heroin or snorting a xanax bar.. but here i am smoking some buds.<br />&quot;pot calling the kettle black&quot;<br /><br />look at the bigger picture.
