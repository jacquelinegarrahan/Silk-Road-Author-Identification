				Weed doesn&#039;t really help a bunch and I do not really enjoy smoking a lot. Have had some success with Lorazepam but find its a bit week. Any one know good medication that stops paranioa attacks? I usually get them like once every two weeks and they come on quite strong but do not last long.

				Paranoia is pretty deep set. It&#039;s hard to find any medication that you can take regularly that will actually remove it. The best you&#039;ll get is some kind of relaxing drug that will distract you. If you yourself are actually the problem, then there&#039;s not really any medication that can fix that&nbsp; (believe me I&#039;ve tried)<br /><br />MDMA will all but obliterate paranoia.. but it&#039;s not really a med. <br /><br />Xanax will probably help though I guess, it can&#039;t hurt to try it anyway

				+1 for the xanax, try about 0.5mg and it should be all gone for 4+ hours. But watch out for the withdrawals if you start taking it regularly, as it can actually kill you in extreme cases.

				if i have done fuck all physical activity all day and i&#039;m not in a good frame of mind then yes. Sometimes i take an xanax when its really bad, but i usually exercise most days now so not really anymore. <br />Sometimes i wake up paranoid but thats usually if i have something really bad to worry about, but then when i get up its fine.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">best drug to stop paranioa?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sobriety.<br /><br />In seriousness,<br /><br />1) Most benzos will do the trick, and kill your experience also. If xanax is too expensive, source phenazepam or etizolam. Be careful though. A friend took 6mg phenazepam and slept for 20hrs, which alerted people around him. He also took 10mg etizolam to abort a psychotic pentadrone session, and his body was depressed to the point of not being able to respond to external stimuli; chest rubs and cold water proved futile for several hours until he woke up highly disorientated later. In times of distress, we can make irrational decisions to make the paranoia go away. The best idea is to have a pre-measured dose of the benzo before even starting. <br />&nbsp; <br />2) GHB will work also. Alcohol is not a good substitute but in times of distress it can be better than nothing (make sure to check beforehand if there is an interaction with the agent that will be causing your paranoia and the alcohol) even if it acts as placebo.&nbsp; <br /><br />3) A desperate labrat will self-administer heroin or any other downer, but what a waste. It&#039;s an option, nonetheless.&nbsp; <br /><br />4) Paranoia is often intensified by irregular heart beat. Medications which stabilize the heart (usually end in &quot;-lol&quot;) can slightly reduce the symptoms (please check interactions).<br /><br />Overall there is no drug that will allow you to get high as fuck and magically erase your paranoia. If a substance is causing you to be paranoid every time you dose recreationally, it may be worth considering (1) reducing the dose (2) finding a different substance. However, if you insist on using this substance, the least you can do is to be prepared when shit hits the fan - so that the paranoia does not cause harm to you or expose your activities.

				Clonazepam is the best benzodiazepine by far, If allowed to dissolve under your tongue it can conceivably alleviate a panic attack. But, here&#039;s the kicker, it lasts much longer than any other benzo, 6-12 hours on average, this can be a good or bad thing if your prone to worrying or panicking. If you want to try them out, I have x1 sampler listing.
