				i recently ordered 5 grams of mdma to sell in my town. i was just going to sell points of the crystal but i could make a lil more and people would probably like it more if i sold it to them so they could just take it like a pill. im wondering what size of empty gel capsule i should get and what i should cut the mdma with ? i was thinking caffeine. im not sure though. probably make capsules with .15 of a gram of mdma and the rest is cut with caffeine. if anyone has done this let me know thanks. !

				Don&#039;t cut it. <br /><br />Just put the 150mg in each capsule, you know it might be hard to believe but when people buy MDMA, they EXPECT M-D-M-A.<br /><br />Caffiene can make people jittery as hell, as well as it&#039;s a stimulant - mixing two stimulants isn&#039;t something advisable.<br /><br />

				People would be more pleased if they got uncut MDMA. Just cap it up with 150mg and if the MDMA is any good, you will have repeat customers for sure!

				Don&#039;t cut it with anything active but fill up the capsule.&nbsp; So you are using a filler and not really cutting it.&nbsp; It is purely psychological.&nbsp; If I had the following:<br /><br />Cap A: 150mg of mdma and nothing else (half empty capsule)<br /><br />Cap B: 150mg of mdma and the rest with filler (full capsule)<br /><br />I tell subject I have 2 different batches of molly that I want them to try out.&nbsp; I give subject Cap A to consume and tell them to report back to me in 2 weeks to test Cap B out.&nbsp; They will roll harder off of Cap B because in their mind they are saying &quot;Hey, this cap is fuller than the other one, It must be better time than last one!&quot;&nbsp; Of course there are many other factors that will effect ones roll but it will all boils to the ______ effect.&nbsp; Fuck I forgot that word, someone help me out!<br /><br />Just my opinion though!

				If your customers don&#039;t really understand the concept of milligrams, then by all means cut it, but don&#039;t cut it with a stimulant. How about glutinous rice flour? It has a nice narcotic look to it, and is harmless.

				Don&#039;t forget that people might want to snort the contents.<br /><br />It&#039;s lactose you&#039;re looking for. It&#039;s inactive. It&#039;s the filler in almost any XTC pill, also many pharmaceutical products.<br /><br />And no, 50mg of lactose is not an issue for lactose intolerant people.<br /><br />Stay away from caffeine and the likes.

				Again to the people saying throw other shit in, please don&#039;t.<br /><br />People are paying you there hard earned money for MDMA, granted that is what you told them it was - MDMA and MDMA only.<br /><br />They are not paying you for caffiene, and all that other bullshit. <br /><br />Some people, like myself are super sensitive to caffiene - it can put me in major panic mode. <br /><br />So, essentially it&#039;s not safe to sell it to people when they are unaware. It&#039;s not really that safe to sell MDMA ( I sell it on here, so I&#039;m not judging)&nbsp; but you know what I mean. <br /><br />Unless you are telling them everything you&#039;ve put in the capsule then you are the kind of person giving dealers a bad name. <br /><br />So, please - Just use pure MDMA.<br /><br />Also, good luck with it all.

				&quot;making my own mdma capsules... what to cut the mdma with ?&quot; <br />No! If you&#039;re making MDMA capsules, make them. and make them MDMA only. Eventually, (a while) Iit make time&nbsp; bet you will be able to just sit back and wait for customers to come to you if your product is pure. I say that because pure MDMA capsules are much more rare these days so people will get them where they can. When I found a legit hook IRL, I would only use that person. When somebody gave me some cut shit, I wouldn&#039;t go back. Because of that, I wouldn&#039;t get too many crappy mollys.

				If you plan on selling to other people, please do not cut it with anything.<br /><br />Place 150mg of pure uncut MDMA in a size 0 vegan capsule, and sell for 20-30 USD, depending on local prices.<br /><br />If you are strictly using for ONLY yourself personally, it depends on whether you want a speedy roll or a relaxed roll.<br /><br />If you want a roll to dance with, I&#039;d recommend cutting it with Methylone and 4-FA.<br /><br />If you want a chilled out roll to cuddle with, I might suggest cutting it with etizolam and sildenafil.<br /><br />Cheers!
