				Alexander Scriabin was undoubtedly a musical genius, and a madman of sorts, whose music goes largely overlooked, especially in the West. A drug in their own right, his breathtaking piano and orchestral compositions push the boundaries of physical possibility. A musical crystallization of what Zarathustra must have heard amidst the mountaintops from his hilly hermitage, the music of Alexander Scriabin summons to life hidden aspirations in an overarching activity of affirmation. There must be chaos in his heart, for he gives birth to a dancing star.<br /><br />What do you think Silk Road? If you arent well acquainted listen to his 10 Sonatas as a general review of his work, the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th are especially good.

				Yes, very unnerving yet entrancing music. What about Gy√∂rgy Ligeti (Lux Aeterna, Atmospheres, and others)? Equally great in my opinion.

				Ligeti is an astonishingly talented composer. I&#039;m not going to compare greatness though. I personally prefer Scriabin&#039;s esotericism and I have a weak spot for piano solos, which Scriabin championed for clear reasons. I searched the Silk Road forum for any discussion of Alexander Scriabin and, while music is widely discussed, he was not represented in the forum.
