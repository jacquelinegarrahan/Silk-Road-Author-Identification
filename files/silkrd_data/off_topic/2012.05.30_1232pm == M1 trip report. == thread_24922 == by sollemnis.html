				Title: <strong>M1 trip report.</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				This morning wasn&#039;t a good time for me, got a phone call from my mum to tell me my dad has cirrhosis of the liver. With his drinking habits it was only a matter of time. I always got moaned at about my drug use, but his &#039;legal&#039; way of getting wasted has come back to to haunt him. Anyway I&#039;m telling you this because I made this report as a thank you to Limetless, his M1 came through today and the timing couldn&#039;t have been more perfect.<br /><br />I&#039;ll give a brief review on it, then paste what I wrote whilst I was &#039;rolling&#039; so to speak. I&#039;ll write the noticeable effects it had on me as well.<br /><br />M1 is very similar to MDMA, though has its own unique feeling. It hasn&#039;t got the &#039;magic&#039; MDMA has, but IMO has its own magic. I call it &#039;awakening of the soul&#039; I felt like something inside of me had come back to life... I almost felt like a kid again in some parts of the experience. It gave me appreciation of music, inner peace, empathy, increased sweating, lights were brighter and mild euphoria. The euphoria was very mild (maybe not even euphoria in a full sense) But I call it euphoria because it felt so fucking great. As i call it &#039;awakening of the soul&#039; It&#039;s weaker than MDMA and has a much shorter duration. I took it about 2 hours ago and I can still feel it, but I&#039;m definitely coming down.<br /><br />The dose was 300mg parachuted. A high dose, but I&#039;m a big guy and have a tolerance to MDMA. This report may not be perfect, but its my first ever report so go easy&nbsp; :). I&#039;ll paste the notes that I wrote whilst I was &#039;rolling&#039;. Enjoy the report, if you want some M1 go to Limetless. <br /><br />Not sure if this is placebo, but I’m feeling calm and the world has become more perfected<br /><br />&nbsp;I’m feeling a rush identical to one from MDMA maybe even a tad stronger but this may be due to dose. Mood has noticeably improved as well.<br /><br />Wow, I’m feeling mild euphoria, not as strong as MDMA’s but very satisfying. Not sure if its euphoria or not, just a beautiful feeling.<br /><br />This euphoria is weird, not euphoria in the full sense, but I feel like my soul has been given methamphetamine and has finally become alive.<br /><br />Time to listen to some music, lets see if it can match MDMA’s enhancement of music. (Thanks so much Lim you’re a fucking legend)<br /><br />Listening to Coldplay – The scientist, this song has much more meaning now, I almost feel like crying… (check this song out guys, its AWESOME, I’ve always loved their songs)<br /><br />I’m not sure whether the music has enhanced the drugs effects&nbsp; or if its ‘peaking’ but I think I can safely say euphoria is present. Still not as strong as MDMA’s but is very nice, slightly different though. I still have that feeling of my soul being awakened and its making me want phone all my family and friends. I really want to tell them to LIVE LIFE, LIFE IS A FUCKING GIFT.(lol) The euphoria feels a little more ‘pushy’ than MDMAs as well, but I like it.<br /><br />Just finished having a cigarette by my window and oh my god, I just wanted to roll around on the floor and giggle like a little child. Like I said before, I feel like my soul has been awakened, I feel more open to the world,&nbsp; at peace… very similar to MDMA’s sense of openness and peace, but is different in a way I can’t describe.<br /><br />Feels a lot like MDMA now, but&nbsp; a lot weaker. Has its own unique feeling, very satisfying. The euphoria isn’t ‘strong’ in a full sense, I’m seeing life as perfect and it feels fucking great.<br /><br /><br />End of the report :). I&#039;ll update later about the come down etc... Please go easy, this is my first report!<br /><br />

				Agreed.. You can tell your having a good time by your writing... I&#039;ve not tried it either, missed the boat before the ban came in (I assumed they were all &#039;shit head shop crap&#039;) and avoided them... I&#039;m quite interested in trying Mephodrone i think.. Is M1 Methylone?

				M1 is Methylone yeah. Mephedrone is even better... I love Mephedrone equally as much as MDMA.

				Yeah Methylone is M1 mate. I also sell Mephedrone as well but I&#039;m out of stock at the moment. Producing a new batch soon though so will be back in stock in no time. There are some reviews of my Meph on the thread &quot;MEPHEDRONE VENDORS&quot;, get&#039;s good feedback. :)<br /><br />Also cheers for the spanking report Sollemnis. Nice one!&nbsp; ;D

				yeah i used to buy drone online before the ban, but never got round to M1. I liked drone and just kept buying that, but I have drone these days and it doesn&#039;t compare to the old stuff! I don&#039;t know why....But I&#039;m really keen to get some of Lim&#039;s JWH and M1. Will hit you up soon mate.
