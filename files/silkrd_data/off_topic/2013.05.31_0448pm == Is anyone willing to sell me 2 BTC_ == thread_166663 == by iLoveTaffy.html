				I have no access to a car to get to a bank or a store to use western union or whatnot, so I want to see if I can work with you guys! I mean, we&#039;re all friend here, I&#039;d hope?<br /><br />Anyway. I need two of them and I can pay via paypal. Anyone interested?

				Also, does anyone know if using Dwolla to fund BitInstant or something is worth it? 3.99% fee. =/ Is it even safe to use Dwolla for SR?<br /><br />Also, for anyone willing to sell me BTC, my paypal account is verified.

				Thing is,I don&#039;t think anyone is going to give out their paypal info on here seeing as it is totally traceable <br />I suggest that if you need it right now,go on ebay and type in bitcoin btc.some people take paypal but you will be paying well overprice for btc.

				What about BitInstant and using a credit card to purchase bitcoins? Is that ok? And yeah, I wouldn&#039;t ask someone to give their paypal address over this site. We&#039;d probably contact each other on the clearnet.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can think of any other ways for me to get 2 BTC that doesn&#039;t require me to leave my home, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it.
