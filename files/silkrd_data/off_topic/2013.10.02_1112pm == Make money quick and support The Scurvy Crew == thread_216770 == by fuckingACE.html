				Right gang, <br /><br />TSC were one of the best Opium and hash suppliers of the darkweb and I´m not about to let it die out. <br />As well as a saving hand for us, this is an excellent opportunity for sharp eyed investors to turn a fast profit. <br /><br />So here´s an investment op for you guys,&nbsp; Almost all our funds were caught up in the SR takeover, including 8k in escrow 4k in this weeks takings and some restock funds with which we were preparing a resale op with CHER. We are now looking at restocking and moving over to BMR (already have the profile up and are putting up ads) and SHEEP, to do this we need to raise some funds. <br /><br />If between one or more of us we can raise 4000 Euros I would look at a number of options. <br /><br />1. a % of earnings in TSC going forward for either one or 2 months, the % would depend on the amount of money that you donated. <br /><br />2. In the loan scenario we would pay back 25% interest on any amount loaned within 20 days of the loan<br /><br />Some background info. T.S.C was in the top 9% of vendors 2 months ago, slipping to top 14% when we took a 2 week holiday. Last month we earned 31,600 Euros NET. The daily averages this month were of 1250 Euros a day Gross. <br /><br />To everyone out there, our customers or not if you can help out even in any small way to get a good vendor back up and running please donate to the following address and send me your name via message, If we get back up and running I´ll make sure to send some good surprises back your way.&nbsp; <br /><br />19V2B8oGQQkEXNY5pstzbQ3WaCM6KQmjqA <br /><br />Also a big hug for everyone out there thats lost a lot when the ship sunk. Were all there for eachothother and this community still stands. Stay strong, and stay united. <br />ACE

				Also I forgot the 3rd way you can help out<br /><br />3. Advanced sales. If you are looking for hash, opium or weed, You can send your order via email ( herisson@safe-mail.net)&nbsp; and ship it to you in 2 days once we have raised enough for the restock. We will be selling items at a discounted price to encourage sales. If you are interested email us for our price sheet.<br />

				i don&#039;t get why you wouldn&#039;t just get a credit card and draw 4 grand on that. if you paid it back in a few months then you wouldn&#039;t even pay any interest at all.
