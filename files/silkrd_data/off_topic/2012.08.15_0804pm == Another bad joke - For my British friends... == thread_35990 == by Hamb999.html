				<br />The Liverpool manager flies to Baghdad to watch a young Iraqi play<br />&nbsp;football and is suitably impressed and arranges him to come over to Anfield. <br /><br />Two weeks later Liverpool are 4-0 down to Arsenal with only 20 Minutes<br />&nbsp;left. The manager gives the young Iraqi striker the nod and on he goes. <br /><br />The lad is a sensation, scores 5 goals in 20 minutes and wins the game<br />&nbsp;for Liverpool. The fans are delighted, the players and coaches are delighted and the<br />&nbsp;media love the new star. <br /><br />When the player comes off the pitch he phones his mum to tell her about<br />&nbsp;his first day in English football. <br /><br />&#039;Hello mum, guess what?&#039; he says in an Iraqi accent. <br />&#039;I played for 20 minutes today, we were 4-0 down but I scored 5 and we<br />&nbsp;won. <br />Everybody loves me, the fans, the media, they all love me.&#039; <br /><br />&#039;Wonderful,&#039; says his mum, &#039;Let me tell you about my day. <br />Your father got shot in the street and robbed, your sister and I were<br />&nbsp;ambushed, gang raped and beaten and your brother has joined a gang of looters, <br />and all while you were having such great time.&#039; <br /><br />The young lad is very upset, &#039;What can I say mum, but I&#039;m so sorry.&#039; <br /><br />&#039;Sorry?!!! Sorry?!!!&#039; says his mum, <br /><br />&#039;It&#039;s your bloody fault we moved to Liverpool in the first place!&#039;

				It made me laugh even though I don&#039;t understand if it is sarcasm or if it is suppose to mean Middle Easterners in Liverpool have a tough time do to racism and crime.<br /><br />I think of the UK being soft compared to American ghettos, but I really don&#039;t know that for sure. In one week we had 6 murders on our street over the summer do to folks and moes.
