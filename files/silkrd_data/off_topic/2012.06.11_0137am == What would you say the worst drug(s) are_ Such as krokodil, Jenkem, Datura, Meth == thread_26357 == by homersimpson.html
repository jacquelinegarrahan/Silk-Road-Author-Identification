				Doesn&#039;t matter if your reasons are for how addictive it is, how dangerous it is or how readily available etc it is just would like to know.<br /><br />I&#039;d personally say Krokodil after reading about it being up to 10 times stronger than heroin and containing nasty shit that will rot you.<br />Jenkem sounds like the most vile &#039;shit&#039; i&#039;ve ever heard in my life if it isn&#039;t just a hoax..<br />Datura sounds pretty fucking scary as well along with other solanaceae&#039;s.<br />Meth is pretty hard shit in my eyes (I guess crack as well) but both of these I would possibly try in a controlled manner if I knew I was doing it with all the precautions.&nbsp;

				In terms of simply being terribly dangerous I don&#039;t see it getting any worse than krokodil, I can&#039;t imagine what would prompt anybody to even want to try such a thing. I&#039;m pretty sure Jenkem is a hoax, I don&#039;t really see how human feces can be a psychoactive. <br /><br />I&#039;m kind of intrigued by Datura, I find the idea of movie-like clear as day hallucinations to be terribly interesting. I wonder if taking it with MDMA would combat the frightening aspect of it

				I&#039;d have to agree that Krokodil is probably by far the worst.<br />Especially after I read this article:<br /><br />http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/krokodil-the-drug-that-eats-junkies-2300787.html

				Krokodil is terrifying.&nbsp; I also read that article.&nbsp; I watched a documentary by Vice on scopolamine, or datura, and that is some frightening stuff.&nbsp; I had no idea of the mind-control part of the drug.&nbsp; Strippers or hookers in some country (can&#039;t remember which, where the datura trees grow naturally) &quot;swipe&quot; the drug under their clients noses, and sometimes beat them up and steal their wallets.&nbsp; Or they just force them to go to their bank, empty out their account.&nbsp; One guy got taken home by some prostitutes and emptied his entire house out for them, gave them everything.&nbsp; The next day, he woke up and didn&#039;t know anything until his doorman told him.

				Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />By FAR the most dangerous drug I&#039;ve ever taken.<br /><br />But seriously I have to +1 you for the alcohol + prescription drugs.. I&#039;ve seen some fucked up shit in my time, and done worse, and had fucking horrible trips and terrible horrors, but there&#039;s nothing worse than waking up after a night of vodka + benzos, covered in mayo and chicken, with one shoe, no shirt, with grazes on your genitalia, with no memory of what the fuck happened and no way of piecing it together.<br /><br />Still to this day I have no fucking clue what happened.<br /><br />Alcohol + benzos you could have entire fucking MARRIAGES on that shit and suddenly wake up one day and not remember any of it.

				Lmao that&#039;s fucking classic!<br /><br />It&#039;s scary though how you can all of a sudden be on a night out, and then your memory totally disappears and you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />Even at my most drunk, I can always seem to piece things back together.. half formed images here, vague memories there..<br /><br />But alcohol + benzos is just total BLANK. And the scariest thing is that during that time, you can be fully fucking active. What is it that lives you at that point? If you can&#039;t remember it at ALL... yet you know you lived it.. it&#039;s fucking scary

				krokodil is only dangerous because its made by idiots, the active compound desomorphine is just another opiate, fentanyl is hundreds if not thousands of times more potent than heroin but it doesnt rot your body because its a clean substance, its the impurities left in it by the amateurs who make it that cause the horrible effects that have been seen. its what happens when idiots who dont know what theyre doing try and make drugs. moral of the story if youre not a chemist and arent willing to learn to be one, then for the love of god dont try and make drugs<br /><br />so my vote goes to datura and similar awful deleriants

				I had a friend of mine take a Benzo for the first time at&nbsp; a bar one night.

				@forgot my password:<br />Right, because with red phosphorus you could <br />end up &quot;krokodiled&quot; with a bad Meth recipe as well.<br />Meth is the worst drug I&#039;ve done in my whole life,<br />but I have to say I already decided to take it only<br />once before doing so(to QotSA&#039;s &quot;First It Giveth,<br />Then Taketh Away&quot;, followed by a good bong hit).<br />I thought my heart explodes(even before the bong),<br />I ran miles and miles on a really hot summer day<br />smoking a lot of weed(about 5 times my normal rate back<br />then, which was about 3 times more than now) in the bong<br />to nearly no effect, other than that it reduced the side effects.<br />I&#039;ve even managed to get some sleep just to awaken like I had<br />3 coffee cans in my blood stream, but I wasn&#039;t that cranked<br />and overloaded anymore and felt relatively fine. <br /><br />On the other hand, all other life-threatening situations have<br />been mostly due to Ethanol, including a blackout experience<br />I really will enjoy when returning to the infinite information<br />potential. I woke up with a &quot;TOOL&quot; stamp one day before<br />a &quot;TOOL&quot; gig in Prague(maybe I&#039;ve even met my musical<br />idols and don&#039;t know about it anymore...:-[). <br /><br />Had a lot of dark beer and warm Absinthe before the blackout, <br />with which I painted the wall of the hostel where my friends <br />and I have slept. We even didn&#039;t have to pay for the painting <br />of the wall, but maybe they just told the new customers &quot;that<br />is a Jackson Pollock&quot; or something to that effect.<br /><br />Another Ethanol excess ended in a Tetanus infection,<br />due to myself falling on a wine bottle, cutting up <br />my hand, getting a lot of dirt into it when later<br />I went to a Hardcore gig where I&#039;ve moshed<br />the shit out of the crowd, even 3 people<br />trying to hold me back had no luck,<br />the only time I&#039;ve ever got aggressive&nbsp; <br />by myself on Ethanol, but maybe it <br />was the Tetanus, the 2C-C or the<br />5-MeO-DiPT.&nbsp; A rolling beer bottle knocked<br />me down in the end and I got the dirt<br />of the concert floor into my fresh wound.<br />Had a red stripe growing all along my arm<br />upto my armpit the next day, but I went to <br />hospital halfway and they&#039;ve told me I&#039;d be dead<br />if it had reached the armpit. Got 3 gram <br />antibiotics i.v. and then orally when I <br />couldn&#039;t stand the side effects anymore.<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;ve been poisoned with Scopolamine<br />or it was really just hypnosis, but when I<br />had my last job application before the<br />job I&#039;ve got now, I went to a &quot;school&quot;<br />(to apply as an assistant) that offers <br />negotiation trainings, NLP and energetic <br />counseling etc.<br />They also have ties to diplomatic <br />academies and secret services,<br />as one of their most prominent trainers <br />has been working for counter-terrorism, <br />the Israeli prime minister as a negotiator<br />with Palestine etc. and he even developed<br />a negotiation system of his own.<br />&nbsp;<br />I had mentioned meditation, shamanism<br />and graphic design among my hobbies<br />and I&#039;ve sent them an alchemical picture <br />as an example, which I&#039;ve created for a <br />friend who had his birthday on the same <br />day(and held a psychedelic club party in <br />the student home I was living back then)<br />I found the love of my life over the net.<br /><br />All I remember from the interview<br />was that they&#039;ve told me that I<br />&quot;didn&#039;t pass the test&quot;, that I&#039;ve<br />&quot;lost&quot; 15 minutes(this I&#039;ve realized<br />myself) and that they have more or <br />less guaranteed that I will get the job <br />I now have in a big cultural institution <br />that is surrounded by the great lodges<br />of liberal, low and high level Freemasonry.<br /><br />I think the already mentioned<br />&quot;Devil&#039;s Breath&quot; is what the <br />&quot;Pow Pow&quot; video by LCD <br />Soundsystem is about, besides <br />corruption, prostitution and <br />Freemasonry:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYCV2zybQoI<br /><br />But as I&#039;ve just watched Jesse Ventura&#039;s <br />&quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; about hypnosis,<br />MKULTRA and Manchurian canditates,<br />maybe it was really only hypnosis:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzh9D4g0pG4<br /><br />If Scopolamine really works the way it<br />has been depicted in the interview,<br />than that&#039;s THE TOOL we need <br />to reboot the system. <br />Get some Anon!<br /><br />Then there was my only real HORROR trip,<br />due to a very strong passion flower tea that<br />even gave the 3 of us strong effects for the<br />first time from the tea alone followed by<br />a massive dose of cacti concentrate that<br />had been cooked for over 12 hours.<br />3 days of screaming faces for me<br />and I didn&#039;t touch Mescaline since<br />2003. But I look forward to finishing<br />my diploma and then enjoying gammagoblin&#039;s <br />synthetic Mescaline, something I&#039;ve been looking<br />for over a decade(and a half, if you count from<br />seeing &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; for the first time).<br /><br />But from a purely physiological perspective<br />I think sniffing glue would be the worst.

				[Excerpt from Food Of The Gods, by Terrence McKenna]<br /><br />In his science fiction novel The Man in the High Castle, Philip K Dick imagined an alternative world in which World War 2 was won by the Japanese and the Third Reich. In Dick’s fictional world, the Japanese occupation authorities introduced and legalized marijuana as one of their first moves at pacifying the population of California. Things are hardly less strange here in what conventional wisdom lightheartedly refers to as “reality”. In “this world” too, the victors introduced an all-pervasive, ultra-powerful society-shaping drug. This drug was the first of a growing group of high-technology drugs that deliver the user into an alternative reality by acting directly on the user’s sensorium, without chemicals being introduced into the nervous system. It was television. No epidemic or religious hysteria has ever moved faster or made as many converts in so short a time.<br /><br />The nearest analogy to the addictive power of television and the transformation of values that is wrought in the life of the heavy user is probably heroin. Heroin flattens the image; with heroin, things are neither hot nor cold; the junkie looks out at the world certain that whatever it is, it doesn’t matter. The illusion of knowing and of control that heroin engenders is analogous to the unconsious assumption of the television consumer that what is seen is “real” somewhere in the world. In fact, what is seen are the cosmetically needed surfaces of products. Television, while chemically noninvasive, nevertheless is every bit as addictive and physiologically damaging as any other drug.<br /><br />Not unlike drugs or alcohol, the television experience allows the participant to blot out the real world and enter into a pleasurable and passive mental state. The worries and anxieties of reality are as effectively deferred by becoming absorbed in a television program as by going on a “trip” induced by drugs or alcohol. And just as alcoholics are only vaguely aware of their addiction, feeling that they control their drinking more than they really do… people similarly overestimate their control over television-watching… Finally it is the adverse effect of television viewing on the lives of so many people that defines it as a serious addiction. The television habit distorts the sense of time. It renders other experiences vague and curiously unreal while taking on a greater reality for itself. It weakens relationships by reducing and sometimes eliminating normal opportunities for talking, for communicating.<br /><br />Most unsettling of all is this: the content of television is not a vision but a manufactured data stream that can be sanitized to “protect” or impose cultural values. Thus we are confronted with an addictive and all-pervasive drug that delivers an experience whose message is whatever those who deal the drug wish it to be. Could anything provide a more fertile ground for fostering racism and totalitarianism than this? In the United States, there are many more televisions than households, the average television set is on six hours a day, and the average person watches more than five hours a day, nearly one-third their waking time. Aware as we all are of these simple facts, we seem unable to react to their implications. Serious study of the effects of television on health and culture only began recently. Yet no drug in history has so completely succeeded in remaking in its own image the values of the culture it has infected.<br /><br />Television is by nature the dominator drug par excellence.&nbsp; Control of content, uniformity of content, repeatability of content make it inevitably a tool of coercion, brainwashing and manipulation.&nbsp; Television induces a trance state in the viewer that is the necessary precondition for brainwashing.&nbsp; As with all other drugs and technologies, television’s basic character cannot be changed; television is no more reformable than is the technology that produces automatic assault rifles…

Taking 1 or 2 xanax bars will make you much more relaxed and will probably have you lying about not doin much of anythin lol.

				Scopolamine hands down the most dangerous. Hell I can&#039;t even find a vendor here willing to give me a small sample for my collection. If that shit ain&#039;t magic idk what is. It&#039;s a hallucinogory powder that is extracted from the seeds of the datura fruit. some one could blow 5mg your way and if your breathing at the time you will be high in less than and hour and once the effects hit you you become a zombie in the tense that you have none of your own consciousness but are still acting completely normal and willing to do what just about anyone will tell your. Ask you to help them load their truck and next day you find out your apartments empty, or your ass hurts and both your female friends are lying next to you when you awake and you have a hella sore ass and both chicks are raped to death. <br /><br />Look at it in a good way thought like asking your boss for a raise or blowing it in a cops face when you get pulled over and within a minute or two he will be letting you on your way....hopefully with a police escort.

You&#039;re telling me you&#039;d rather sniff shit etc then smoke crack? -IF- it was pure, I&#039;d much rather smoke crack.<br /><br />-many- pure drugs are actually not as bad for you, but getting them is near impossible. For example /pure/ heroin will give you diarrhea I believe, and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />The impurities fuck everything up.<br /><br />Now, the worst drugs by far would be alcohol and prescription pills, because of the widespread usage and availability. BUT, you can be responsible with almost any drug out there, it comes down to the persons mental stability and intelligence.<br /><br />Benzos are bad for your body, but in moderation and used in a responsible setting is fine. Taking 1 or 2 xanax bars will make you much more relaxed and will probably have you lying about not doin much of anythin lol. But when you go drinking after you&#039;ll end up blacking out, and that my friends is not being responsible ::).<br /><br />PS Sorry if this is written awkward kinda high right now ::)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Crack was high on the list coz it&#039;s rapidly habit forming with a sub-MDMA high.
