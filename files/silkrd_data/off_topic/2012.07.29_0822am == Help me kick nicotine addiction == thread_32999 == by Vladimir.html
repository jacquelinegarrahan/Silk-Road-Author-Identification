				starting off slow till your tolerance doesnt need it&#039; then substitute it with something different.. usually an oral fixation like smoking can be handled as if taking a baby off the bottle start slow, and before you know it, you&#039;ll be eating ice-cream next time you feel that urge...

				maybe so&#039; but you need to weigh out the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s , better something like food&#039; then something that you dont really like, i feel maybe you do it because your use to it, and not because you truly enjoy it.<br />i was just using ice-cream as an example, but feel free to use celery sticks and peanut butter, or like a stick of gum<br />The mind should be satisfied if you trick it properly :)

				think you&#039;ll always need determination and willpower to be able to quit. Some manage with that alone..<br /><br /><br />what helped me alot was a medication named Champix (or brandname Chanpix or Chantix in US, I think. Active ingredient Varenicline. Need prescription)<br />I used to smoke 20+/day for more than 10 years and thought Id never quit, atleast not in very long.. then whent to the doc for some other minor thing where I told em I smoked, and the doc wanted me to quit and suggested to try that to help. Didnt think about it too much,&nbsp; accepted and decided to try, I had been thinking of quitting for many years already and were noticing many bad sideeffects.<br /><br />Think I used it for like a month while changing around old habits and slowly trying to smoke a bit less (most of the common quit-smoking tips included) until the planned final quit date where I was supposed to lay off cigs for good- and I made it! (kinda, for like 6 months=S..but for good now very soon!)<br />Somehow the medication made me think the taste of cigs tasted horribly, as if the chemical nasty taste of the cigs were strongly pronounced so I no longer felt attracted to light a cig.. knowing Id hate the taste. Btw. that effect lasted for many months after quitting the meds too.. I even hated the smell when others smoked around me.. <br />Also its supposed to bind to the nicotine receptors or something to decrease the desire while not keeping you addicted to nicotine like other nicotine aids does.<br />Stubbornly kept to it, and knowing after day 3 (or something-), nicotine is out of my system and then its only the willpower part remaining (not giving in to the temptation to light another cig from then), I kept away from it.. altho I kept getting the urge to light a cig in situations I usually would, this urge supposedly occur rarer and rarer till you almost never think of it &quot;out of nowhere&quot;<br /><br />Due to some other unrelated reasons I also cut a 12+yrs of nonstop heavy toking (cannabis) around the same time, and stupidly started toking again earlier this year after doing some other drugs.. eventually smoked some times with tobacco aswell where it was the &quot;only&quot; chanse for a proper toke (stupid stupid..), and had just a few puffs of cigarette every now and then after such toke too (i like a plain cig a lil while after a toke when I dont toke too often some times), and now is on it again...... :[&nbsp; But! Ive been thinking every day now for some time &quot;this is the last cig.. no more tomorrow!&quot; and even stayed away from it for 2 days in a row again on pure willpower, but then others around me are toking that I give in to and decide to join on and end smoking a cig too (smoked lotta tobacco anyway thru the joint..)..&nbsp; anyway, that last day of smoking is any day now for me.. possibly just had my last cig if Im going to bed in a bit. <br />Not having cigs available seems to help alot to me, I guess Im a weak person this way:/<br />I dont wanna start on the Champix pills again (wont bother seeing doc..) and am confident Im pretty sure Ill manage without this time, but maybe I wouldnt have fallen back to start smoking again if I had followed to instructions if using Champix for several months after quitting smoking (I stopped taking the pills right after I had stopped)<br /><br />Btw. apparently those pills have a plethora of possible nasty bieffects, altho I noticed no bad ones.. weirdly they seemed to give me vivid dreams every night while and months after I was taking them, and I usually never dream. Also supposedly increase risc of cardiovascular disease and heartattack in predisposed people, can make u suicidal (!).. or something like that, and many other weirdthings.. Worth reading up a bit on it and considering the possible riscs. Also, that funny effect of them where I thought the taste/smell of cigarettes changed and was nasty lasted for several months after quitting the pills.&nbsp; <br />Edit: Also, I think they costed like $500 for the first 2 starter packages or so.. but maybe you can get it cheaper<br /><br />I think they helped alot and would reccomend them! 2 others around me tried them too but they failed, but I believe they were not as determined to quit in the first place. Its not an off-switch, still need some determination/willpower that I dont really think I have alot of,heh, but atleast for me they seemed to help alot.. <br /><br />see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline for some more info<br /><br />look it up, ask your doc, maybe it can be of help for you too. <br /><br />you really should quit smoking,soo much crap coming with it besides early death.. now or never, call ur doc!=P<br />Good luck!

You can delay the cig for a little while like that! atleast sometimes, on the path to quitting. Possibly along with forcing urself to smoke less and less.. find something else to put ur mind to to skip a cig now and then, or throw it away halfways thru or something.. whatever, just try break these habits.. may also be helpful.<br /><br />Also if you do a google search theres loads of more info on stuff to help you along the way. Also some cool charts that shows how your body slowly heals from the damage over time the longer you have quit etc. that may help as a lil encouragement aswell. Loads of nice stuff and people in similar situations if you search something like &quot;help to quit smoking&quot; on Google, many small nice tips where you may find one and other thing that may be helpful for you

				I am in the process of quitting. Been smoking 20 a day for 10-12 years.<br /><br />Anywho... 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s not just the nicotine.. it&#039;s the process.. the hands to and from the mouth.. the something to do.<br /><br />Back to the task at hand...<br />The best way I found to cut back is to eliminate the places and things you do while smoking.<br />For instance.. I used to SMOKE A TON in my car.. now I quit smoking in my car.. haven&#039;t smoked a cig in it... since December.<br />Definitely working out for me.. and now when I smoke at home.. I&#039;ll smoke maybe half or less and throw it out.(Don&#039;t save it.)<br /><br />It all adds up and boils down to will power. We all have it but can we use it? :)<br /><br />Good luck sir!

				1st time I gave up after years of smoking I read a book called &#039;Allen Carr&#039;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking&#039; ...and fuck me, it worked. For about 6 years I was off them. Then I stupidly started smoking again. This time I&#039;m using snuff tobacco, sniffing it is much healthier then smoking from what I&#039;ve read. You get a good nicotine buzz from it too and it it gets rid of the craving unlike nicotine replacement products (imo). Takes a bit of getting used to but so does smoking.<br /><br />I plan to read that book again because being addicted to anything is no fun.

				I don&#039;t know if this helps anybody, but when I stopped smoking (smoked daily 20 cigs for 2-3 years) the one thought that stopped me when I was craving for &quot;just one&quot; cigarette was &quot;this will only stop the craving for like 30 minutes, after that&#039;s you&#039;ll feel like you do now&quot;. <br />It&#039;s a fucking circle, realising that helped me a lot.<br /><br />

				Lol it depends, but it&#039;s much easier to quit pot then cigs, so if you replace cigs with pot effectively, then quitting pot would be easy and you&#039;d be left with no addiction ;D

				I&#039;ve never tried giving up myself, but I&#039;ve known a few people who have managed it quite easily by using e-cigs.&nbsp; You get all the sensations that you are used to, with the hand-to-mouth action, the hit at the back of your throat, and even a bit of &quot;smoke&quot; (vapor) when you exhale.&nbsp; You can even get menthol ones etc, and various strength refills, depending on your needs.&nbsp; <br /><br />They seem to do the job as a substitute pretty well, and if I was to try to give up, that&#039;s the route i&#039;d probably take.

				You might as well just start iv&#039;ing nicotine..there is no hope. lol jk..but there are plenty of alternatives from patches to hand gels. I find the hand gels work real well when i didn&#039;t have any smokes. And an e cig will help with the psychological part of needing to have a cig on your lips and inhalation.

This book is amazing. It doesn&#039;t tell you why it&#039;s bad for you (we already know that) or how expensive it is. It essentially explains in simple logic why you&#039;re an idiot for smoking. How you&#039;re brainwashed, how withdrawal symptoms are bullshit, and it&#039;s all mental. Nicotine takes only 72 hours until it is completely out of your system. It&#039;s all about feeding the little monster. I cannot recommend this book enough. He even says how smoking a joint or using heroin makes MORE sense than smoking, because at least they give you a high of some sort. <br /><br />The ONLY thing a cigarette does is get you through to the next cigarette.

				Was smoking the same amount as your for about 4 or 5 years, didn&#039;t even really want to quit but I listened to this e-book called &quot;The easy way to stop smoking&quot; by Allen Car; i&#039;m sure you could probably download it free online. It is essentially brainwashing, changing your thought processes every time you think about having a cigarette to make you realize the stupidity of it. The interesting thing is the book tells you to keep on smoking until the book is over, 3/4 the way in I was so repulsed by the things that I had to stop.

It&#039;s a respiratory and digestive tonic, and is considered one of the best natural cures when it comes to quitting smoking.<br /><br />I have used it before, as it&#039;s also considered to be a brilliant mood enhancer, it&#039;s a wonderful natural pick me up!<br /><br />All the best of luck in quitting, it&#039;s one of the hardest things you&#039;ll ever have to do, but when you get there I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be happy you did!&nbsp; :)

The nicotine dose in those is hardly effective anymore, but you still get to go trough the ritual of lighting a fag and all, while you physical dependence on nicotine diminishes.<br /><br />Ibogaine should not even be considered to aid in smoking cessation: Its a substance used experimentally in dealing with opiate withdrawal, but the side effects include problems that go from ataxia to nausea to abnormal hearth rhythm. Using it can possibly result even in rather sudden death, far worse than the cigarette habit you were trying to treat.<br /><br />A similar thing goes for Zyban (bupropion): Taking SSRI&#039;s to deal with addiction that wasn&#039;t -that- threatening to begin with i crazy in my book. <br /><br />Personally, the only thing that reduces craving for smoking are opiates. Somehow the concept of going from a smoker to a morphine popping addict doesn&#039;t really appeal to me ;)<br /><br /><br />

				been heavy smoker for a few years and this is how i quit smoking regularly and only smoke with the buddies... <br />1. watch those nasty ass videos on youtube about how much smoking harms you. That shit got me thinking straight. It used to be that everytime I wanted to smoke, i&#039;d pop one of those videos open and take everything it says for the TRUTH, then afterwards, i wouldn&#039;t wanna smoke anymore. <br />2. don&#039;t buy cigarettes.... sure some people tell you to stop slowly... but trying to cut down is harder than just not buying it. <br />3. if you crave for a smoke, just smoke weed. Honestly i can&#039;t say anything else. That shit keeps my mind off cigarettes and calms me down 100x than a ciggy does. And its actually beneficial for your health....
