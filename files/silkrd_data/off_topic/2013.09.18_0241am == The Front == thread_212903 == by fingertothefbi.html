				So I need a front, not a great one just one to show people who are close to me but don&#039;t condone the selling of drugs, I work part time on and off basically bullshit jobs that come my way but I dont care for. But alas I am unemployed again so the annoyance begins from parents to siblings to aunts and uncles &quot;O you dont have a job this very moment you must be worthless or dysfunctional what is wrong with you?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Just makes you want to tell them &quot;yea I sell drugs make enough money to live a decent life and keep a lot of time for focusing on my health, reading, learning ect&quot; <br /><br />But I can not<br /><br />I want something I can tell everyone I&#039;m doing something off the books that high paying perhaps? Maybe something involving the internet like blogging?<br /><br />It hurts to have to live the double life sometimes but it is the path I choose to walk and right now its who I want to be <br /><br />Any idea&#039;s would be much appreciated thanks!!!!

				Do all your relatives prove to you that they have a job?&nbsp; Why must you show them???<br /><br />Just tell them something, then that&#039;s that.<br /><br />You work as a server for a catering company... you get called out to work random events, weddings, company dinners etc.&nbsp; You don&#039;t know where or when you&#039;ll be working until a week before when you get your schedule for the week blah blah blah&nbsp; &nbsp;No, your family cant come crash somebody&#039;s wedding because they want to see you at work... you&#039;ll get fired... not like they weren&#039;t invited to the wedding anyhow.<br /><br />Done.<br />
