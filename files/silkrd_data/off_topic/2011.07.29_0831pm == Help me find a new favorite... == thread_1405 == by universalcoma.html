				Up until recently, my drug of choice has always been mdma.&nbsp; I love the stuff, whether I was going to a party or rave, the beach, on a hike through the forest, anything I did I knew would be a blast with e mixed in.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a heavy user, once or twice every 2-3 months now, but I&#039;ve also started to explore new chemicals.&nbsp; As much as I like the idea of psychedelics, the only one I&#039;ve tried came in the form of mushrooms.&nbsp; They&#039;re super fun, but not as much fun as ecstasy, for me.&nbsp; I&#039;ve extracted and smoked DMT as well, and as much as I love it, it&#039;s still not quite what I&#039;m looking for (although if I had a steady supply I would smoke it all day&nbsp; :P).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been waiting on acid for a while now, but sadly it hasn&#039;t come in.&nbsp; <br />I&#039;ve also dipped in to dissociatives (DXM and MXE) and have found that I&#039;m in love with them, as well. <br /><br />I wanted to know what everyone&#039;s thoughts were on different chemicals.&nbsp; I&#039;m a psychonaut, so I like exploring my mind, but I also enjoy going out into the world and seeing the beauty in nature.&nbsp; I&#039;ve found that some people like a smooth trip with everything they take, and others (like myself) can handle &quot;too much&quot; without freaking out, so if there&#039;s anything with a crazy body load, I can deal with it.

				MXE IS awesome, it went from &quot;this is all right&quot; the first time, to &quot;OMG WTF&quot; thereafter.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been looking into the 2c&#039;s, I think I would like 2c-b, so I&#039;ll start with that.&nbsp; Are all of them worth trying individually?&nbsp; For the most part I&#039;ve only heard &quot;2c-x is kind of like 2c-y, but with more/less of this/that.&quot;&nbsp; To me, that doesn&#039;t seem like a very substantial difference...

				To preface my long and rambling post, I started out as a regular user of E in the early 2000s and after a few years of blissful conversations with friends/significant others, raves, and solo rolls I started making the same progression as you.&nbsp; It&#039;s been an extraordinarily fun journey and I have yet to try anything that I can look back and say &quot;Ooh, branching out and trying that was a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; Oh, except for salvia; had one very uncomfortable trip with my girlfriend at the time.&nbsp; We both lost all sense of trust in one another and weren&#039;t able to talk about it, and in retrospect, if we had forced our way through those emotions and talked it out, we might still be together now.&nbsp; That should have been an ecstasy night, not salvia.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven&#039;t had a chance to do a &quot;common&quot; dose of 2C-B yet, but having ordered some from here I&#039;m looking forward to having a couple of days off work to do so.&nbsp; I tried a 12mg dose a couple of nights ago and found it to be a really mellow yet friendly experience compared to LSD and shrooms.&nbsp; I&#039;m can&#039;t wait to try a stronger dose and combine it with MDMA.&nbsp; <br /><br />Even at a low dose I had a noticeable sense of physical well-being and empathy; the patterns on my stained concrete counter were breathing and shifting in a beautiful way; but I didn&#039;t have any open or closed eye visuals. Took a couple of somas after 3 hours or so as I was coming down to facilitate sleep since I had work the next afternoon and woke up feeling fine.&nbsp; An interesting note is that while on it, I didn&#039;t feel a desire to have taken more for a stronger trip.&nbsp; From reading other trip reports and my one low-dose experience, it seems like a versatile substance that can be lots of things for lots of people (somewhat similar to MDMA).<br /><br />The other 2C-series is also interesting, but I personally prefer the shorter trips of 2C-C (which I&#039;ve tried also at a low dose and it was similar to my recent 2C-B experience, but it lacked something that made me interesting in ordering more).&nbsp; The 8 hour trip that faded in and out on 2C-I was a bit long for my taste and also didn&#039;t have the warm fuzzies that I got on 2C-B.<br /><br />Also if you like MXE, I&#039;d definitely see about getting some ketamine to try.&nbsp; Some of my most memorable drug experiences have been had on K.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had any profoundly spiritual experiences yet, but even more-so than with psychedelics I&#039;ve had really odd thought patterns that after the trip make a lot of sense and have given me a different way of looking at life and myself in the long-term.&nbsp; And, it&#039;s a lot of fun in smaller doses :D<br /><br />And as a last thought, once you&#039;re comfortable with substances individually and have done your research, combining them - ie MDMA and LSD) can lead to ridiculously good times.&nbsp; One of my best friendships that&#039;s been going strong 10 years now all started the night I first tried that combo and started talking with somebody I had just met the day before.&nbsp; Hopefully your acid arrives soon so you can give it a go ;)
