				I was just looking at some snowmobile trips and happend to be looking at google maps. The border is huge. The drug problem is not near what it is to the Mexico border. Is it patrolled regualrly like the MEX border or could one literally ride a snowmobile back and forth over the border without people ever even noticing? Its just so vast and rugged i cant imagine it being patrolled. Like look at the great lakes. Can the coast guard patrol that? they are huge and it seems like resources would be limited. what about along the North Dakota Montana border? Holy Shit its huge. Sorry my brain was just wondering thes questiosn as i sit here. i never hear anything about USA/ CAN border patrol its usually either at customs mail points or entry/exit points.

				It is nowhere near like the Mexican border.&nbsp; I have read an article in High Times years ago about a guy who was mountain biking across the border with a few pounds of bud and just planned to ditch the bag if he caught a border guard chasing him which was highly unlikely being that he would be in the woods where cars can&#039;t go.&nbsp; Something you could do with your snow machine.&nbsp; Just dump the bag if they are in eye sight and lawyer up if they find it and try and pin it on you.&nbsp; Worth a shot for probably doubling your money.
