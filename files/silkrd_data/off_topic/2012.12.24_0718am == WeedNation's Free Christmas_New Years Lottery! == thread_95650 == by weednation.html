				Hi all SilkRoaders! I am finally back from vacation and re-opening my store! As a token of gratitude to the SR community for giving me so much business during the past three months, I am hosting a free Lottery to celebrate Christmas and New Year! One lucky contestant will win 0.6G of Jack Herrer and 0.6G of Grape Ape! The Grape Ape is the same that I currently have listed on my vendor page. To enter, you must first read the ENTIRE rules section below, then write something below so I know you want to enter the lottery<br /><br />Here are the rules: <br />1. You must have at least 50 forum posts, have good karma and have spent at least 50$ on SR to enter (winner must prove their spending limit to me via message before I ship)<br />2. This lottery is only open to residents of the USA (Sorry but I don&#039;t ship overseas)<br />3. Only ONE entry per person<br />4. Winner must write a review (thread URL: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42743.0) and if possible, post a picture as proof of delivery&nbsp; <br />5. Winner will be drawn randomly using Random.org on 12/28 at 8PM PST <br />6. I will message the winner but he/she has to claim the prize by messaging me back within 24 hours or else another winner will be drawn. <br />7. No accounts that are younger than this post allowed<br /><br />Here are some HD pictures :<br />(left one is Jack Herrer and the right is Grape Ape) <br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=014d5b71c965206b81a23fd3b49ccad3.jpg<br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=7510ea34ef9a706439ea1e6af89f67c9.jpg<br /><br />As always, please visit my vendor page and become a fan (Link in the Signature)! <br />Happy Holidays! <br />-WN :)<br /><br /><br />Entries: <br />1.

				I would like to offer a huge apology to WeedNation for not responding in a timely manner. I had a family member pass and had to drive home for a couple days. Congrats to the winner and thank you to WN for the opportunity anyway.
