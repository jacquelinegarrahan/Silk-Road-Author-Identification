				Long story short... felt like i pissed myself, lots of kaleidoscopic colours, saw some elves peeking behind doors, was in the DMT &#039;waiting room&#039;, came back to reality when my brother walked into my room. Was pretty weird overall, I was kind of shocked but was sure that there was definitely more that could have happened. <br /><br />second time, i did it again after around an hour or so because i was too curious to see what it&#039;s like to breakthrough COMPLETELY.&nbsp; felt as intense going in as it did the first time, but felt like I didn&#039;t do enough so I woke myself up and did some more, went back in, said to myself &quot;shit i&#039;ve done too much&quot; (the DMT was on a bed of ashes and it actually went on fire at one point) and then sooner or later nothing was happening really. I think I saw chainsaws and blood like i was watching someone drilling into my skull or something but it wasn&#039;t scary or anything.. just there. I heard some noises too but overall it was pretty underwhelming. Now I&#039;m thinking of doing it again in a few hours but I&#039;m looking for a completely amazing experience like the ones I&#039;ve read about.<br /><br />Anyone had a similar experience? Think I did anything wrong?

				You said it caught on fire?&nbsp; Sounds like you were smoking out of a bong or a bowl with weed or something under it.&nbsp; Just stop now your wasting it man.&nbsp; Get yourself a freebase pipe (meth pipe) and smoke out of that.&nbsp; It is going to be 10-20x more pronounced.&nbsp; Seriously it will be worth the wait even if you order it.&nbsp; Otherwise some headshops sell them just gotta look around.&nbsp; But for real get yourself a freebase pipe!<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />Stunt Bum

				i have yet to try dmt, but will be soon.&nbsp; from all the homework i&#039;ve done, unless you&#039;re smoking changa, it&#039;s a waste to smoke it out of anything other than an oil burner.<br /><br />if you don&#039;t want to go to the hastle of finding an oil burner, you can make one out of a light bulb.&nbsp; get a pair of needle nose pliers,and pull out the center cap of the bulb screw.&nbsp; you want to keep the threads, so be careful.&nbsp; then put in some salt, and shake it up.&nbsp; this will get rid of the white &quot;paint&quot; inside the bulb.&nbsp; get a 2 liter bottle cap, drill a hole in the middle, and put an ink pen cartridge in the 2 liter cap.&nbsp; then it will screw right onto the light bulb threads.<br /><br />and no, i&#039;ve never smoked meth in my life ;)

				I&#039;ve just been using a glass pipe and vaporized it perfectly once I got the flame to the right distance but I guess I&#039;m still confused about the whole experience well see how it goes the third time

				Hey brother, how are you smoking it? What are you using? how much are you using - breakthrough dose is usually 50mg - 60mg <br />If you are using a normal bowl, sandwich in between marijuana, this will let the dmt burn without destroying it (with direct contact with the flame) but will also give you that little boost to breakthrough, try smoking the whole bowl in one hot, hold it in for as long as you can and let go, you should feel and hear a buzzing noise in your head, get ready for blast off. After that everything you thought existed will disappear and you will be completely confused for a few seconds, not knowing if your dead or alive, after that a wave of calmness will crash over you and you will be in hyperspace. <br /><br />Good luck, it give it more than an hour between trips.

				A bed of changa sprinkled with DMT and Jungle Spice I imagine is the ultimate breakthrough recipe. I&#039;ve never actually tried but next week I&#039;ll have the necessary resources, so I might give it a go.
