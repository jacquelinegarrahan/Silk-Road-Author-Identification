				I have now been working with multiple people and thanks to everyone who helped, but I need this last mix to be examined. So far it tests amazingly. It gives the desired effects of NZT from limitless and more.&nbsp; It is a mix of racetam&#039;s and similar chemicals.<br />The only issue after it is perfected is that from my current chemical connections it would cost 100$ a day and of coarse it needs to be taken daily. Please PM me and I will message you back the ingredients and dosage. Also if anyone has any suggestions for purchasing the following chemicals please tell me:<br /><br />I need all of the following in powder form and as pure as possible, these can all be bought on the clearnet with little search, but the price is very large, so if anyone can help, it would be much appreciated.<br />Lion&#039;s Mane<br />&nbsp;Pyritinol <br />&nbsp;CDPcholine <br />&nbsp;fish oil <br />&nbsp;picamilon <br />&nbsp;phosphatydlserine matrix <br />&nbsp;phosphatydlcholine<br />&nbsp;sulbutiamine <br />&nbsp;aniracetam <br />&nbsp;bacopa<br />&nbsp;piracetam<br />Oxiracetam<br />&nbsp;inositol <br />sublingual methylcobalamin <br />Noopept<br />SAMe<br /><br />Keep in mind this is not the full ingredients list. There are 4 chemicals which I did not list here because they are my, so to speak, secret ingredients. <br /><br />

				If you can get some kind of effect that isn&#039;t harmful/doesn&#039;t risk harmful, this is interesting... but you need to be careful with nootropics. Make sure you don&#039;t have too much stuff increasing serotonin and the like. Serotonin toxicity is nothing to laugh at.

				No offense but this just looks like a link-to-link list of stuff you find on Wikipedia when searching for nootropics, etc.<br /><br />At the last office I worked at, some frat-guy types got hold of some Nuvigil (Armodafinil) and jokingly called it NZT.&nbsp; It kinda annoyed everyone else :(<br /><br />Some of the chemicals you list may have nootropic properties, but I posit that you can&#039;t just go combine every drug with such a property and expect them to just &quot;increase&quot; one aspect of their impact.&nbsp; For example, one of your chemicals serves as a full Serotonin agonist.&nbsp; Another serves to block reuptake of Serotonin.&nbsp; Yet another (Sam-e), tends to function as a precursor to this neurotransmitter.&nbsp; Just those three, taken together at a normal dose, would probably kill you due to Serotonin syndrome.&nbsp; And that&#039;s just the first item on the list.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, many of the things you list are just consumer supplements that can be bought on amazon, at the drug store, etc.<br /><br />Finally, don&#039;t forget about homeostasis; you don&#039;t get something for nothing when it comes to medicine, unfortunately :(
