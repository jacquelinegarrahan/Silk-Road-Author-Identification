				i am looking for someone in the area to meet in person. if you have a good reputation i&#039;m willing to take all of the risk or do whatever i can to prove that i&#039;m legit. i will be using the site to get things very soon, but when i don&#039;t want to wait around for stuff to arrive it&#039;d be nice to have someone to turn to that&#039;s somewhat near me. like i said, i&#039;ll do whatever i can to prove that i&#039;m no threat or anything, but i would really love to find someone i can count on since i moved away from my old connects. also, if there is somewhere that is more appropriate for me to post this, please let me know. it&#039;s kind of hard to figure out where to post a mip proposition on such an anonymous site like this, so i&#039;m just guessing where i should be posting. anyway thanks for any help.<br /><br />bd

				Hey and welcome to the forums. Good luck with your request. Might I suggest that you remove this topic? Topics can be removed by the person who started it. You just have to scroll to the bottom past the last reply and click on &quot;remove topic&quot;.<br /><br />Pretty soon people here will start giving you all kinds of hell. I could be wrong. <br /><br />Anyways I know how you feel. I have been living where I am at now for just a month and yea it sucks when you know nobody to get what you need. Asking people to meet in real life is a sure fire way to get in trouble here. How ill anybody know if your a cop or not? How will they know if you are sincere or if you are going to rob and kill them?<br /><br />Just trying to be honest and helpful. Good luck to you sir
