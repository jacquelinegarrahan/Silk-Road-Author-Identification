				Hello<br /><br />Well over 24 hours I set up 4 deposits with Bitinstant. Used moneygram at walmart to get this done.<br /><br />all 4 were between the amounts of 497-500$ each. I got the money for two in my mtgox account but confirmation emails for all 4. Only two of the deposits show up under my account history on mtgox<br /><br />Id worry about it less but my roomate did the exact same thing but his two deposits arent shoing whereas the other two are credited in his account.<br /><br /><br />Is this typical of bitinstant to only allow 2 to to get to youtr account per 24 hours? New to bit instants service.<br /><br />Thanks guys

				I don&#039;t use BitInstant anymore but it seems like I remember them having a daily limit. This may or may not have changed since I used them last; it&#039;s been a while.

				They have a daily limit of $1000 per person, and $500 per transaction.&nbsp; They also state that they will not refund your fees if you go over this limit, so don&#039;t expect that.&nbsp; In fact, expect for them to be pretty damn frustrated at how blatantly you broke their rules.&nbsp; The reason you are only seeing half is because the other 2 transactions are now stuck in their fraud filter, so you will have to get in touch with them directly to push them through.<br /><br />

				No it says 500 limit per transfer, 1000 through banks and 2000 daily. <br /><br />I stayed under 2000 for the day/<br />I have emailed them twice but im assuming because its the weekend rhey are really not answering emails

				I&#039;ve read some say they can&#039;t do more than $1000 a day due to government regulations over money laundering.&nbsp; Possibly they are waiting for the next day?&nbsp; If it happened to both of you, it seems routine although I&#039;d contact them.
