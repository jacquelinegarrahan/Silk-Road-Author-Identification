				As far as I know, there are two types of weed: Cannabis Sativa and Cannabis Indica. And another type I forget that grows in the southern U.S. with a pretty low THC content. Then there&#039;s different strains but here&#039;s how I get confused.<br />What&#039;s up with all the different names for weed? They&#039;re all just weed with different amounts of THC. In fact it would be more convenient to me if weed was named based on it&#039;s THC content - like Sativa 20%, or something like that. <br />Just wondering if I&#039;m the only one who thinks like this?

				Their are lots of names for all drugs. But weed has the most, I agree with you I wish people would just say the thc %, and sativa/indica

				There are different names for strains because not every parent is the same. A lot of plants are hybridized and take different qualities from the parents and thus the baby can be named something else. It&#039;s the same with corn, there are hundreds of thousands of different strains of corn with a slightly different genetic make-up because they all derive from slightly different parents. The US has all these strains of corn held in a secret bunker where they test new strains to make sure they can withstand new viruses that could attack the corn and devastate the world&#039;s food supply.

I&#039;m still skeptical though, CriagX from temple420 (yeah, the guy actually owned a weed church in california which was a church and a dispensary) said that there&#039;s no difference between weed strains in terms of how the high feels.

				Don&#039;t just speculate, buy a gram of each of some of the more &#039;commercial&#039; varieties: eg Whjte Widow, AK47, Amnesia Haze, Northern lights etc. These varieties are pretty consistent in quality.

				Yeah sorry if I came across as aggressive but when I read posts like yours it&#039;s like a slap in the face to hardcore/connoisseur growers and smokers we&#039;ve put our balls and money on the line for obtaining and smoking the best strains for ourselves and our customers (whether recreational or medical)..<br /><br />anyway man, done a bit of digging into some old .txt files I had laying about and racked my brains on advice I was given over the years and here&#039;s what I got:<br /><br />the main chemicals are :<br /><br />THC - chem responsible for the fuzzy, uppy high<br /><br />CBD - the chem that causes the couchlock and body stone,<br /><br />THCV - i believe this is what causes mild psychadelic experiences and potentiates the THC in strains, very rarely shows up in most strains<br /><br />CBC - the healing part of the plant...builds up immune system and is a pain reliever doesn&#039;t get a lot of credit but would probably explain why so many medical patients get a healing effect from the plant.<br /><br />CBG (not sure)<br />CBL (not sure)<br />CBV (not sure)<br /><br />it seems like there&#039;s also a ton of other non-psychoactive compounds but not a lot of info on their effects yet, somehow they help the conversion of the other cannabinoids...chemistry isn&#039;t my thing but hopefully some more research into the future will shed light onto the other amazing chems in this plant.<br /><br />the reason Jwh-018 feels like weed so much is because it binds to your natural cannabinoid receptors in your body replicating the feeling of thc. back when I used to smoke it i found my tolerance with jwh-018 went up 3 times higher then with weed so maybe the other chems in weed have something to do with that also.<br /><br />hope that sheds lights on things

				Many online resources have good breakdowns on the differences between strains. There&#039;s a verrrrrrry large variety of factors that go into it. <br /><br />Indica and Sativa are the most basic subsets of marijuana. <br />Indicas largely providing a heavier body high and body relaxation. Usually recommended for night-time smoking, pain-relief, trouble sleeping, stress relief.<br />Sativas tend to give a stronger head high and has a more &quot;up&quot; feeling. Usually recommended for morning/day-time smoking, anxiety, depression, stress relief.<br />Then you throw Hybrids into the mix, which can be anywhere on the chart. Some are a 50/50 mix, 90/10 , 25/75... and so on.<br /><br />Now, each strain isn&#039;t simply called Sativa, Indica, or Hybrid because beneath these subsets there is still more subsets. As mentioned by onestopshop, there are many different active chemicals in marijuana that we are still trying to figure out exactly how they work and how they affect us. Some strains will give a more psychedelic high, some will provide more pain relief, some highs will be very light and some will have you locked into your couch before you finish smoking the bowl. <br /><br />Beyond the effects you FEEL, growers of strains will take into account the taste, smell, yield, time from seed/clone to harvest, weather conditions necessary, even the height of the plant or how much it smells. Some strains are more resilient to pests and molds. <br /><br />Then you have the different phenotypes that strains can have. Just like people, not every plant grows the same (unless cloned). Babies can end up growing to be slightly different than their mothers and show different characteristics. Growers pay close attention to these phenotypes and will allow babies with positive characteristics to flourish while removing babies that have negative characteristics. After continuing this cycle for a good while and nurturing the characteristics you like, you can end up your own personal strain that will grow with the same characteristics 90% of the time.<br /><br />An example that is quite noticeable for me is Jack Herer and Trainwreck. Both are mainly Sativa strains that have very different effects on me. The Jack will be very heady but light behind the eyes. I can easily focus on this strain and the light high seems to last a fairly long duration. When it comes the the Trainwreck it will hit me very heavily behind the eyes and be very powerful in the head. I find this strain peaks very quickly and is hard to focus due to the strong euphoria. If both were simply labeled Sativa I might as well be reaching into a cookie jar of random nugs.

				Cannabis is a genus of plants that include the species Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis, and hybrids of one or more of them.<br /><br />Landraces are plants that are native to a region, say India or Afghanistan. But with the advent of selecting breeding and indoor growing, many different strains have been produced. According to seedfinder, there are over 3,500 different strains of cannabis.<br />http://en.seedfinder.eu/<br /><br />The strains are often named for the various characteristics of that strain (White Widow, Bubblegum, Strawberry Cough, Lemon Skunk, etc). Because cannabis reproduces sexually (with male pollen and female flowers), plants have different phenotypes, so sometimes a fertilized mother can produce offspring that is different than either parent, or showing traits that are more similar to one parent. Clones however would be exactly like the parent.<br /><br />Cannabis plants contain different amounts of trichomes and different ratios of cannabinoids, terpenoids, phenols, etc. A certain terpene may have a pine smell, or citrus smell, or fruit smell, or spice smell, etc. There are over 80 cannabinoids that have been discovered (maybe even over 530), although THC and CBD and CBN are the most talked about. And different plants have different ratios of cannabinoids. For example, sativas may be high in THC but low in CBD. Indicas like Harlequin may have more CBD than THC. And different factors can cause those cannabinoids to deteriorate.<br /><br />There is a website called budgenius.com that reports on cannabis from various medical dispensaries and it&#039;s analyzed in a lab (I think with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry) and the THC/CBD content is listed. Without that kind of testing I doubt most people know how much THC is in any given bud (although certain strains often follow similar patterns).<br /><br />So absent that kind of scientific testing, for years growers who would just name a strain whatever they wanted (Stinky Purple for example). Although many growers remembered the lineage of a given strain (which can be seen on seedfinder).<br /><br />There is also a website called leafly.com where you can find strains that have certain effects. However, every human&#039;s body chemistry is different, so one strain can have one effect on someone, and a totally different effect on someone else. Different people also metabolize substances differently. And cannabinoids that have deteriorated can have a different effect. Also, the method of ingestion can lead to different experiences for the user.<br /><br />The following thread has some great information related to that:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7190.0<br /><br />..particularly these 2 posts by DigitalAlch:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7190.msg64152#msg64152<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=7190.msg64535#msg64535

				I wish the names could be more professional. There&#039;s way too many strains, and I keep finding new ones I like better all the time. Even if there were only 100 strains, I bet no one could agree on a top 10. and of course, not smoking the same thing over and over makes it even more enjoyable.

				First...naming is done by breeders...so the name is going to be as colorful and imaginative as a stoner wants. <br /><br />Second while there only three species in the cannabis genus those three plants are differentiated, just like other species into varieties. <br /><br />A common and relatable example being the genus canis includes a dozen species....Canis Lupus includes two sub species familiaris, and dingo. Now within Canis L. Familiaris there are more variations than you can throw a stick to. If you were going to pick up a dog, despite all dogs being Canis L Familiaris, I think youd be quite interested to know the variety....<br />pomeranian<br />japanese chin<br />chihuaha<br />Poodle<br />Boston terrier<br />Afghan Hound<br />Saluki<br />Bull terrier<br />Staffordshire Terrier<br />Rottweiller<br /><br />Quite a bit of difference from one to another....lots of names....then you have the hybrids<br />Labraoodle<br />chiwee<br />puggle<br /><br />Ultimately stupid names exist every where there is a number of very similar items being sold....dont get me started on apples (7500+ cultivars) or oranges (600+)
