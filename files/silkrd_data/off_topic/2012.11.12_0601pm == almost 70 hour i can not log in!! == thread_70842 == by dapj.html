				Don&#039;t panic, everyone is in the same boat.<br />Read this sticky by DPR on the &#039;Silk Road discussion&#039; forum<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=70747.0<br />There have also been posts by inigo and chronicpain relating to SilkRoad&#039;s downtime, you&#039;ll find them on the discussion forum as well.

				I guess if you spent some of that 70 hours having even a cursory look at the forums you would have found the 50 or so other threads about the same issue.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I dont know whats worse ATM, all the spam from dodgy Bitcoin vendors or illiterate posters clogging up the forums starting up yet another I cant logon message.

				Ok TopCat (one of my favorite old cartoon :P), no problem. Yes i know that is why i said it in the first place also (first sentence :) ) But i am just so worried and frustrated because in all the time i am on SR this is taking very very long. I am not sure exactly how long i am a member and when the day was that i joined in this awesome place&nbsp; :D! But i was here when Nucleo was still around and not in stealth mode but open for everybody. And it was the last 7-12 weeks he was here before he was gone or went stealth for loyal costumers...but in all honesty i never was sure if he went in stealth the last weeks so correct me if i am wrong&nbsp; ;) :D !!<br /><br />But i still remember the photo of his white nr #4 Heroin....the only seller off China White that was really 100% from the source and never there was the same quality again at SR...NEVER !!<br />I only smoke H so nr #3, i never had iv&#039;ed and i never will do it and i know that i&#039;m so lucky to have a needle-phobia&nbsp; :D :D , otherwise i would have tried it from the moment i was addicted to (smoking) H because i know you don&#039;t spill anything and you do longer with less amounts&nbsp; :) .<br /><br />I just want it b back ONLINE, HAVE ACCESS AGAIN TO SR MAIN PAGE AND MY LISTINGS, LOOKING AT MY ACCOUNT, LOOKING FOR NEW VENDORS AND PRODUCTS....I JUST WANNA BRING EACH DAY A VISIT AT MY FAVORITE LOCAL CANDY SHOP, ETC.... :( :(...HEHE ;) :D :D ! AND I THINK I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE&nbsp; ;) .<br /><br />I will now keep more an eye out at the official updates in the topics (i am secretly hoping that they gone have extra hidden servers, hihi&nbsp; 8) ;) ) !<br /><br />Greettzz
