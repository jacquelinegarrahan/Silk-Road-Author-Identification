It&#039;s funny as fuck! <br /><br />And V1ad basically they had the same father and one of them didn&#039;t see their father for years...got in touch...and thus he realisd he was slinging it up his brothers harris. <br /><br />Best thing about it was the fact that the father said &quot;Yeah I&#039;m happy because I can get to know my son&quot; fucking best thing I&#039;ve ever heard in my life. Second best bit was that you could see the exact moment that the one who didn&#039;t know his father realised that it was actually true on his face and then shortly after Kyle said &quot;I know this must be the most ridiculous question in the history of the world...but what is going through your head right now?&quot;....and then the guy walked off. <br /><br />
