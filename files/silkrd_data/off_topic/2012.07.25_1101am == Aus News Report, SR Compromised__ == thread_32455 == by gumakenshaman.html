				The guy who introduced to SR has recently told me to stop using it due to a news broadcast featured in Aus a couple days ago.<br />He said the intention of the report seemed as if they wanted to flood SR with as many new dealers/customers simply to &#039;compromise&#039; and reduce the over all validity&nbsp; of the site.<br />It really is such a shame that the media has chosen to take such cause of &#039;dog&#039; actions (Aus media are right cunts, pardon my french) which only makes me wish I had found this beautiful site earlier.<br />I purchased some bit coins recently to make my very first order but now I am not to sure, I would really love to hear some opinions from seasoned members (especially AUS),but all opinions are welcome.<br /><br />-Guma&nbsp; :)<br /><br />p.s if anyone could link the report that would be real helpful! <br />

				sounds like bollocks to me mate, just stay as wary as you should be when using this site and you should be fine.<br /><br />the first order is always going to be the toughest. whatever you are looking for try to stay domestic as you have some bastard customs to get shit through. and see if you can find a vendor that doesn&#039;t require n00bs to finalise early. i think it will have to be a domestic seller as most vendors require FE from all Aussie buyers due to the fact your customs are bastards

				I wouldn&#039;t worry about it mate. <br /><br />She&#039;ll be right.<br /><br />While, yes, there has been increased media focus on SR in the past few months, as long as everyone stays smart &amp; safe we should be fine.<br /><br />Just go ahead and make the plunge, make that first order! It&#039;s the best :)<br />

				I can&#039;t see an issue with more people getting on here. More customers means the good vendors can stay in business longer, and new vendors means more competition.<br /><br />Just stay safe, and if you&#039;re worried order from an established vendor with good reviews for their profits on SR, AND here on the forums.<br /><br />Good move coming here before purchasing, the more knowledge you can soak up here the safer you should be able to make yourself.

Really just needed some confirmation from others that the SR is still ok if one plays it safe. Used to cultivate and supply psilocybes to the local community but the risk seemed to become to heavy for me to deal with (never wanted to be big time) so definitely worthwhile making a switch now. Going to stay domestic without a doubt, at least until I am able to be in escrow without FE. was going to use HelpingHands, anyone have experience with him/her?

				Got mail yesterday and today :)<br /><br />Nothing has gone missing for me.&nbsp; I research vendors thoroughly - even vendors I&#039;ve used several times, I check their threads to ensure they are still good.&nbsp; <br /><br />AFP and Customs will stumble on to some by luck.&nbsp; But I think the vast majority will remain getting through unmolested.<br /><br />Given the report that said they are infiltrating SR by acting as buyers and sellers - well, I doubt they would act as OS vendors - what would be the point?&nbsp; They have no jurisdiction.&nbsp; So, sorry to any genuine Oz sellers trying to get their business off the ground, but I would be very wary of any new Oz vendors.
