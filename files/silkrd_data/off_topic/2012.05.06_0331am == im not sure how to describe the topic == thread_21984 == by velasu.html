				my pet frog has just &#039;acquired&#039; a kilo of pure uncut cocaine, how would he go about selling this<br /><br />would it be better doing grams, 8ths quarters<br /><br />my pet frog lives in the uk, he wants to deliver uk - uk only<br /><br />would it be silly for him to list half a kilo on here for delivery?

				You&#039;re anon here, and if you&#039;re planning on selling here, there&#039;s no reason to say anything about your frog. Just my opinion.<br />Sell at lower quantities (with higher prices) for the highest profit. Sell all at once and not make as much, but quicker. High quantity would mean you would have to take a chance on one major deal going wrong as opposed to a couple smaller ones<br /><br />I say go small. Offer 8ths/Quarters UK -&gt; UK and you&#039;ll make plenty of money off that kilo.<br />&nbsp;8)

				my next daunting task was how do i get the stuff on the scales then into the bag without droppin it all. i figured out that a tesco baking tray is just perfect to put the kilo block in, then i got a razor blade to chip away at it. i usually find once i get it into the bag ive dropped a few bits of it so i have to try again and again

				Why are you not going to post pictures. That, along with you being a new seller, will make buyers cautious about buying from you.<br />

				Are they really going to buy that you were literally talking about your pet frog in court? &quot;A friend of mine&quot; works fine, but I think talking in obvious code is just going to incriminate you more, not less.
