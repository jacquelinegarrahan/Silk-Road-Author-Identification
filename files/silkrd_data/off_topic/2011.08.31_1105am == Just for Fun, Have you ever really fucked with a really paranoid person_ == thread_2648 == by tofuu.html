				<br />Dealers in real life always seem to be the most paranoid people I&#039;ve ever been around and I&#039;ve had fun toying with their fear in the past....&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Dude, that same car with two-people is still outside your place this week again...&quot; or pretending to hear some high pitched noise in their place that they can&#039;t seem to hear or something else...<br /><br />This post is just for fun, please don&#039;t slam me about the dangers of messing with people and I know the chances dealers are taking are serious, but I was wondering if anyone had any good stories about messing with really paranoid people just for fun?&nbsp; It&#039;s all about perspective sometimes...<br /><br />&quot;hey man, I don&#039;t think you&#039;re being paranoid enough!&quot;

				...you guys really don&#039;t get the perspective part...&nbsp; I&#039;m a dealers best customer, I have money and never need anything &quot;up front&quot; or whatever....&nbsp; you have to be able to see the comedy in life where it really is...&nbsp; Paranoid people just think the world is out to get them and everyone and everything is a trap...&nbsp; sometimes it&#039;s not really like that....&nbsp; maybe sometimes it is, but if someone is really over the edge for no reason, it gets funny.&nbsp; I&#039;ve literally stripped down to nothing before in front of a paranoid dealer because he thought I was wearing a wire, but like I said I&#039;m always the dealers best customer....&nbsp; lots of cash and willing to pay and quiet as hell.&nbsp; I&#039;ve never dealt, because I don&#039;t want to deal with the problems, but when dealers get to know me, they love me.&nbsp; I also usually tell them in the end I&#039;m just messing with them and it always works out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess I&#039;m the only one out there that can see the comedy in something like this, so I guess it is me!&nbsp; Sorry to offend you guys, but I&#039;ve been told all my life I see things different then most people and really paranoid people for no reason can be very entertaining to me...it&#039;s all perspective!&nbsp; Please - don&#039;t hate - I don&#039;t mean to make fun of people, I just see humor where others might not...&nbsp; I know a serious situation from one that&#039;s not real and if someone is really over the edge, I know to keep it straight and quick and not make jokes.<br /><br />just wondering if anyone else had some of the same perspective...<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love &amp; all that...&nbsp; I really have never hurt anyone and never caused any real problems, but I also like to have a little fun sometimes...<br />

				Ahahaha, I&#039;ve never fucked with my dealer, but she wasn&#039;t really too paranoid. I&#039;ve fucked with friends of mine like that though! When one of my friends has been up for a few nights, he was always really paranoid and easily angered. We&#039;d be getting ready to hit a bowl of meth and I&#039;d say &quot;Wait, did you hear that?&quot; or something, and he would have a heart attack! He would get so pissed off when I would do stuff like that to him, lmao! I&#039;d also glance outside and say &quot;LOOK!&quot; and sometimes he would just run to his bedroom and lock the door! It&#039;s fun messing with friends.. Lol

When I&#039;m in a fight, i like to be hurt, it makes me fee lgood and want to fight even more. Thats sadic too.<br /><br />Anyway, imagine if you have a social disorder of being in crowds, and your friends start messing with you because of that. You dont like having that disorder, but you cant do nothing against it. I dont think you would feel confortable with that..<br /><br />But, in other perspective, if you have that disorder, and your friend have fun with you, to help you see that its just a paranoid thing from your head, that would make you feel good, and have fun. Its a matter of how you do things.<br /><br />Peace and love
