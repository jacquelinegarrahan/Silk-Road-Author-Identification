				<br />Hello everybody,<br /><br />Im planning a holiday to europe in late july-early august..mainly to go to a few music festivals...<br /><br />My top choice would be festival in Lost Theory Festival in Croatia... I was wondering if anybody can tell me whats the scene likely to be like? Will I be able to find lucy without knowing anybody or having any friends over there?<br /><br />ALso, what other countries would you recommend where it wont be too much of a pain to find acid going around at the festival?<br />

				Hi dude,<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for Acid, go to Ozora festival in Hungary or Boom festival in Portugal. <br /><br />They are psychedelic festivals and Acid is how they roll. There will be buckets of it at each of them festivals.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure of the dates for either of them, so you&#039;ll have to check it out.<br /><br />Have a great holiday man. Hope you like Europe! :)

				i only know that most of the people i know (including me), that have been to croatia (for holiday or party) in the last few years were at least checked at the borders when entering or leaving the country... these checks might take several hours... the better you hide your stuff the more chance you have to be uncaughgt!!!&nbsp; <br />i&#039;m still not sure whether to go to OZORA this year due to personal reasons but one thing i know for sure!!! i don&#039;t go to CROATIA ANYMORE!!!
