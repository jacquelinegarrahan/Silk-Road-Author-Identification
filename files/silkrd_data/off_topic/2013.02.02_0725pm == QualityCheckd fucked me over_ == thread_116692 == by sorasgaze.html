				I wanted a fast Moneypak to BTC processor and I noticed this vendor had no feedback, but I was also CaptMal&#039;s first customer when he first started and he was the best and quickest BTC vendor on the road, now I have to resort to a game of luck and scammers everytime I try to get coins. I had $85 on the card, I messaged him asking if he had a minimum and that I hope I could trust him seeing that he was a new vendor, he replied the next day with &quot;SorasGaze, I am messaging you to let you know I will be able to complete the BitCoin order, anymore questions let me know. QualityCheckd.&quot; or something along the lines of that, so after I get that, I take my chances and order his listing with my MP number, it&#039;s been processing for 5 days, his listings are now down, after day 2 I sent him a message thinking something was up, letting him know I ordered his listing, he hasn&#039;t read it still, so yesterday I went on the Greendot site to use the Refund technique of verifying the card, and I got &quot;Insufficient funds; your card balance is 0.00&quot;. So I&#039;m pretty sure I got fucked over and can&#039;t do anything about it because my money&#039;s gone, correct? Would contacting support do anything besides possibly ban this vendor? I just want my $85 back, I wish we had more amazing vendors like CaptMal so buyers wouldn&#039;t have to deal with this shit, I would have gone with Sugar Mama or Vice City Bank but I was just trying to see who could process it faster, and Vice City Bank was sold out at the time. Ugh...

				Jesus dude,&nbsp; get hooked up with an exchange.&nbsp; My bank account is linked to a bitcoin exchange.&nbsp; I buy coins by doing a bill payment to the exchange .&nbsp; All online. Easy<br /><br /><br />Wtf are money packs?&nbsp; &nbsp;Sketchy shit. Buying Coins like you are doing.&nbsp; Just buy through the bank.&nbsp; &nbsp;Easy.&nbsp; Transfer coins through a few wallets to launder them and off to SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				You are putting too much work into this.&nbsp; How do you survive every day?&nbsp; Lol <br /><br />Sugar mama is good though.&nbsp; She has good ratings and you do more research into coins.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is my exchange :&nbsp; http://cavirtex.com.&nbsp; &nbsp; They are Canadian and very reliable.&nbsp; They work with. Banks and can link your account to buy coins at the click of a mouse.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paycheck to bitcoins in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m well aware there&#039;s more efficient methods of handling this, but it&#039;s not so possible to have full access to a bank account when you&#039;re considered a minor, so I&#039;m forced to play the game of luck every time.
