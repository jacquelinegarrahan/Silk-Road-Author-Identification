				Got this msg in my inbox this morning... speechless. (other than a good giggle)<br /><br />&quot;Let me start by first saying that I am new here and I was originally directed here for substances and I can fully appreciate all the stigma, doubt and suspicion that would arise from a completely new member contacting you.<br /><br />I am 22 year old musician from Australia<br /><br />It&#039;s just that my life is in immediate and imminent danger through no fault of my own.&nbsp; 3 years ago a junkie attacked myself and my family and I injured him in self defense.&nbsp; All charges were withdrawn against me and after the property damage he caused and after punching my mother in the face it looked like he was going down.&nbsp; But he has connections with bikies and paid off the magistrate and she let him go despite all the evidence.&nbsp; After that he tried to get me publicly defamed twice on television using current affairs programs (to no avail of course) and then 5 months ago, he tried to murder me in my own house.&nbsp; He was arrested at the scene and is being held in the remand center until the trial in December.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that even though I&#039;ve done my best to stay off the radar... moved house, kept quiet... bad and strange things are happening and I can feel something sinister in the air.&nbsp; I feel the only way I can be sure to have the upperhand is to have a firearm at my disposal.&nbsp; I know how to store, mantain and safely use them but getting a license and buying them is not an option for me.<br /><br />I saw you mention that you had family in Australia that could help.<br /><br />I come forward with humility.<br />I don&#039;t expect you to believe me or trust me right off the bat (I can provide proof if you really need) but if you could help me procure something, anything to put the odds back in my favour I&#039;d appreciate it so much.<br /><br />I hope I hear from you soon.&quot;<br /><br />1) Law Enforcement looking for gun traffickers<br />2) If true, out of the whole world to reach out for help, you reach to SR? A drug-net? Come onnnnnn<br />3) Its Aus, theres fucking gnus everywhere<br />4) If someone was attempting to murder him, then he would have some friends in the LE already protecting him...<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS MSG. <br /><br />My .02BTC<br />F1K4S

				Well, he beat me to it. I assumed every new person attempts to solicit weaponry from absolute strangers on the innerwebs. Sounds perfectly legit.

				Awww, why not help out the poor guy...<br /><br />You could have had him jump through a bunch of hoops verifying who he was and how legit he was and then in the end sent him a water pistol!&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp;Those are legal in Aus.. right?

				Tell him to hire one of those &quot;assassins&quot; on THW. They seem to be about as legitimate as his story.
