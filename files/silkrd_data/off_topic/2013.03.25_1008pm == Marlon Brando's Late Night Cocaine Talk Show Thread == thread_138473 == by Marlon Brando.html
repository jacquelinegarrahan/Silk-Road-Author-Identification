				Hey everyone, I thought since a lot of us like to partake in the joys of cocaine and all the wonderful things it brings.. such as TALKING!<br /><br /><br />So I thought instead of users clogging up the review thread with banal small talk, I would create a space for all of us currently partaking in such cocaine related activities so we have a place to rant, rave, talk about anything.<br /><br />Up late? only one home? need someone to talk too?<br /><br />Hopefully you&#039;ll find all of that and more, right here in nose candy land.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*Please understand this is a thread to chat, if you want to review/discuss vendors that is in the cocaine review thread over at the Rumor Mill*<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=27925.0 ---- Keep reviews there.<br /><br />

				Haha yeah that episode is great.<br /><br />To be honest, I just wanted a name instead of a clever nickname for my account so I picked the first famous actor who popped into my head. I have a rotating cast of movie stars to choose from if I ever decide to make new accounts.

				Haha awesome man, I think eventually I&#039;d love to have a reddit style AMA(ask me anything) night sometimes, invite certain members/vendors to have a night in the thread and let users ask away whatever is on their mind. The special &quot;guest&quot; can choose to answer any question they feel like and the readers will end up with a pretty good show.<br /><br />What do you guys(maybe girls?) think?<br /><br />Who would you like to see hosted on the late night?

				No I don&#039;t suppose it has to be a cocaine vendor, but a plausible vendor/member would be the ideal, as I won&#039;t be asking DPR to join us.<br /><br />This is all, in the future as I would have to drum up interest and get some members on board. But it&#039;s all just a thought, if it doesn&#039;t play out than this is still the chill pill place to chat away your high.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m high right now!<br />*locks door*

				You&#039;re right! it&#039;s my show! haha well every show starts of a bit rocky.<br /><br />And yes, I tell myself &quot;I will stay off amazon, I will stay off ebay&quot; I&#039;m not a huge purchase on a whim kind of guy I just ended buying 5 books without realizing that they all add up. I can honestly say there are a quarter of books in my library I have bought while high and when they come in the mail I completely forgot that I had made the purchase.<br /><br />Though at least with cocaine I tend to make calculated decisions about what books to buy instead of when I was an alcoholic and just clicked &quot;buy with 1 click&quot; on anything that looked shiny.

				No worries, we welcome all with open arms.<br /><br /><br />I just watched Amelie for the first time a few weeks ago and was left feeling like I&#039;d seen something special and truly unique.<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit- If any vendors are interested in setting up a little AMA(ask me anything) PM me and we can try and work something out. It will be a free response question session where you&#039;ll be allowed to pick any questions you&#039;d like to ask. Or if the users feel I can poll and come up with some questions to ask you before hand and I can post them with your responses after you&#039;ve had time to reply.<br /><br />Along with vendors I will be looking at certain members who are well respected and knowledgeable to partake in an AMA if they would like. for now I&#039;ll just make it an open forum for suggestions of vendors/members that you&#039;d like to see on MY MOTHERFUCKING TALK SHOW!<br /><br />lines lines lines.

				I have a question for the host,<br />Mr Brando, what is your favorite drug? Have you ever heard of this white powdered sunshine called cocaine? I heard it turns your insides out and makes you puke your stomach inside out all while turning your brain into soup. Sounds fun to me. <br /><br />Good idea for a thread, I wish I had the wallet to be on a cocaine talk show every night.<br /><br />As for the AMA idea, we should try to get Obama.

				What is this cocaine you speak of? I feel like I&#039;ve heard of it but it was explained like a lightning bolt of godliness that makes you shoot straight and speak the truth. A current of strength and clarity unlike anything experienced before.<br /><br />It also costs a lot<br />Can make you feel like crap<br />And tends to make you regrettably start friendships with people you&#039;d rather not have in your life.<br /><br /><br />But besides all that nasty stuff it&#039;s still GREAT GREAT<br /><br /><br /><br />PS. you lol&#039;ing the prez or is there a vendor Obama...I am not well versed in every vendor.&nbsp;

				Ratings are taking a hit! could be a lot of reasons but I don&#039;t think it will be a popular thread until the weekends.

				Dont see why Google would pay for that, would be the perks of being google i guess. :-X<br /><br />Good sponsor ideas.<br /><br />What about Beretta for some gold plated bangers? :P<br />A well known beer and vodka company would be nice.<br /><br />Home security...just live in a castle surrounded my a moat and keep the bridge up, trolls wont get in. :P

				If you&#039;re a hoarder or a prepper and you don&#039;t have something to protect your home with. When the world goes to shit. All you&#039;re doing is holding onto the food for someone who does.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, I totes forgot about alcohol sponsors. That&#039;s a good fit, I&#039;m trying to think of other things I&#039;d be tempted to click on or look at if I saw something high...I should just watch TV and see which adds do it for me. I can probs say not many food companies. Maybe a chewing gum sponsor, everybody likes a little bit of gum.<br /><br />Oh and tobacco, so Tobacco, Alcohol, Firearms. Plus things to spend money on when you&#039;re holed up in your house.<br /><br /><br /><br />I just thought about the google thing because I was going to put google as a sponsor but than I thought....Do they even pay for advertising???<br /><br />J.

				Yeah me!<br /><br />Third bloody night at it which I don&#039;t like doing as I think it&#039;s a waste of coke!<br /><br />I have a new plan to cut down on doing too much of the stuff which is to keep it in a place I can&#039;t access it during evenings at home. Once it&#039;s not near me I&#039;m OK but if it&#039;s in the house, it calls me! :-)<br /><br />I put my stash away in it&#039;s hiding place this week but had a small bit put by for the bro and tricked myself into believing I&#039;d do a line or two and leave it at that but if I don&#039;t go to bed soon the whole lot will be gone!!! :-)

				I&#039;m the same. I&#039;d rather be at home on my own or with someone else doing it but if I start on my own I&#039;d rather keep it that way!<br /><br />I also find if I go out, I&#039;d rather be at home where you can comfortably do lines instead of going in and out of the toilets all night.<br /><br />Expensive form of home alone partying!

				The reason benzos go so well together with coke is that your technically speed balling.&nbsp; Any downer and an upper is basically speed balling.<br /><br />A red bull and vodka is technically speedballing lol.<br /><br />However, obviously benzos are very sedating with anti-anxiety and relaxing properties mixing extra well with the euphoria of the coke.&nbsp; Drooling just thinking about it.<br /><br />I&#039;m a recovered benzo addict though, use to do 12-16mg of xanax through out a day or 6-8mg of klonopin...and at least 200+mg of valium to feel good.&nbsp; Fun days but not worth the dope sickness.<br /><br />Nothing like a few benzos while doing coke or even smoking some pot.

				And I also had an idea that we should create a semi annual buyers guide to cocaine. like a consumers report. Now this would have to be culled from the top snorters and then collaborated on to give only ONE cocaine consumer report out there. We would ultimately judge everything on a scale of 10, and give an end report of &quot;Buy or Stay clear&quot;<br /><br />We can recommend top picks, economic picks, worst picks, anything really. Just read some consumer reports and get the gist and then convert it to SR.

It&#039;s always a nice surprise when I find a couple of lines, I didn&#039;t expect to tonight but I found a couple left in my baggie and thought &#039;why not?&#039;, it&#039;s really great coke and when it&#039;s great a little goes a long way :) Have a fun filled day everyone!

Might be worth popping a flip just to eye ball that sucker!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well Wads at least your on the right bandwidth, you can speak to any one of us here and share your late night tales&quot;.<br /><br />Welcome once again, and we look forward to having you on the show.<br /><br />Just remember, 3AM and board that train...<br /><br />WADOZO everybody!&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;WILD APPLAUSE&#039;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thank you, Thank you folks. You&#039;re too kind. And Johnny, you&#039;re on fire tonight. Why though has the show been scheduled to start at 3am? That&#039;s when SBS&#039;s &quot; Porn of the Week &quot; kicks off. It was supposed to be the Chinese classic from last year &quot; Fuk Mi Hol &quot; staring Ms Ide. It. Inn. and the famous Mr Pinn. Dic.<br />Alright, I&#039;ll give the movie the flick and watch the show.<br /><br />I had my toaster on No. 3 but I wasn&#039;t getting much reception. I&#039;ll try No.7 tonight!.<br />If that doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;ll load up a couple of fat bags of primo and rock on over to your joint Johnny? Fuck,&nbsp; I can&#039;t cause your co-hosting the show aren&#039;t ya?

LOL and save myself 18 hour flight. Peru is a beautiful place, but there&#039;s some places i wouldnt go.. Lima is a great town, and friendly... many smaller towns outside Lima can be pretty dangerous, lot of poor people, gangs, its hard to get around if you cant speak good spanish...&nbsp; La Paz, Bolivia is beautiful / and you can get really good coke there.... but ive gotten some bad shit there too, so i cant always say that everything you buy is 90% pure just b/c it comes from local producers....

				I know this is general discussion, but is it okay to discuss cocaine a little here? not in the sense of reviews etc, but types we&#039;ve seen, heard about, experienced, etc. hope this is cool&nbsp; Marlo.<br /><br />So the stuff I have been seeing around has been a few types....<br /><br />I experienced my first holy grail of coke the other night. Bolivian Flake. I did a line and immediately thought that I had a billion dollars and a helicopter full of naked women. Well you get the idea. It had thin flakes, was white, was really greasy, and was very light almost like lava when it hardens is less dense that normal rocks. It broke up really finely into an even powder with a little pressure. I was told an ounce of this stuff was available, so I jumped on that opportunity. The very sad thing is, that the ounce that what i received was a pile of doo doo. We got baited and switched. For a pile of fake flake full of speed and who knows what else at a price that one would pay for bolivian flake. what a headache....literally... I did some of the stuff that we got and I got a headache.<br /><br />Not all fake flake is all bad though. There is a cut that people are using in my area that has the appearance of being fishscale, but is not. You see the shine and are immediately like damn! I have definitely been wooed by the sparkle. The fake flake cocaine can be okay though. The stuff that you got marlo was that rerock fake flake that I list as hq street or good. It tests clean, meaning no active cuts, but doesn&#039;t give me that HUGE kick in the basal ganglia if you know what i mean. It&#039;s decent okay though. I would do more of it. People really like it too, because it comes in solid chunks and has that shiny appearance, with decent effects to boot. If I were a street dealer, I would probably sell this stuff. <br /><br />Some fake flake is not good though. Like the pile we received when promised a oz a bolivian. I ez tested it and within 30 seconds the test indicated a strong presence of ephedrine. We told our source who is a close friend to the other half of trill that we didn&#039;t want this oz and because he merely middlemanned the deal for gas money, he is working on a refund by peddling it himself. I feel bad for him. WE should have done a little more homework tho too. I guess that some people actually like it though. As well, I read up on lejunks purification method, but don&#039;t have the time nor resources to handle that right now... and would only work if the product had real coke in it lol. so who knows on that one.<br /><br />The other type I have been seeing right now is what is listed as premium. My favorite part about it is that it has tiny crystals all over it. No big orphan flakes floating around. It still isn&#039;t straight off the brick, but its clean and it gets me on a good one. It may be that this is the bolivian with an extra cut in it. It has similar qualities, yet would be less pure when held side to side. We are getting it from mexicans in the barrio. I just sent out an order and got a complaint about it. So I am curious to see what b0lix and murder have to say about it. Be honest guys. I like it.<br /><br />What has been rumored to be around....<br /><br />Peruvian Pink... apparently this shit is pink and you can only get it if you are linked up to I forget which cartel. Apparently we know someone who knows someone that knows when it comes around.<br /><br />Coconut flavored coke? Yea sounds crazy right. I don&#039;t know about it but it is rumored to exist and I would jump on the chance to try it at least.<br /><br />What are you guys seeing? have you seen similar stuff to what I am talking about or is it local phenomenon? <br /><br /><br />

				Late night lives on.<br /><br />I am sorry for my absence but I needed to clear up some things and figure out some hodge podge and this thread fell by the wayside of my mind. Do not fear though, unlike your father, I will never forget you. I have let this thread become its on entity and take off on it&#039;s own two thread legs,&nbsp; it&#039;s got a set of wings after emerging from the cucoon hell that is thread infancy and is marching to its own beat now.........what I really want is to take this time to thank everyone that contributes to the thread by posting in a consistent manner and not letting it fall to the dark side. <br /><br />J<br />Murder<br />Studio<br /><br />And the others who have chimed in.<br /><br />I would also like to give a big shout out to KotT for being a hell of a vendor on SR and coming on and giving his two btc&#039;s of info. Anyone reading this and thinking of a vendor to try? Do NOT hesitate with KotT as you will be hard pressed to find a better or more honest/straight up vendor than KotT.<br /><br /><br /><br />*lastly, and I think most importantly, I want to take this opportunity to have a moment of thread silence. I want the anonymous faces of SR and this thread who have been impacted by any of the events that have unfolded in the past week to know that though we may be faceless does not mean we can&#039;t support one another. Our world is not easy or easy to understand. Evil will happen, and it&#039;s at our worst that we see the best. I implore you all to search on google to find Patton Oswalts paragraph on this, it was touching and heartfelt and he was able to articulate it better than I ever will. <br /><br /><br />Shine on you crazy diamonds.

				some words on top EU cocaine vendors ?<br />I was very much intrigued by SR for cocaine.<br />However prices seem rather excessive. <br /><br />I hadn&#039;t done any drugs for more than 2 years until a week ago; when I scored some cola on the streets and it actually was very good.<br />so i&#039;m wondering whether the coke is better here on SR because there seem to be a lot of hags out there.<br />And I AM NOT willing to pay more than 100 euros for a gram, considering local it&#039;s 50. <br />Only for 80 % + purity I&#039;d be willing to pay somewhere above 100 (max 120-130)

				FRIDAY !!!!!!!!!!!! My .5 is dwindling down! :( So sad! I like this cola stuff...I can see how people can get out of control with it. Hell if I had a brick I&#039;d probably never leave my desk! But I can see this isn&#039;t something I can have sitting around and not be tempted to partake in the fun! I&#039;m just starting with this substance, but I can see many good times ahead. :) Look forward to late night chats with y&#039;all! Maybe even becoming a trusted tester for reviewing! I have done some pot reviews, and am always down to write up a good review! Being a noob to the cola world, I can give great experience reports without having past experiences clout my comparisons! Not that experience is a bad thing! Don&#039;t get me wrong.<br /><br />Anywho...I just tooted my breakfast, and everybody must be at work, or doing normal people things...as I sit here waiting for my afternoon shift to start...in boredom...yet euphoria :) hehe<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />-onion-

				Just dropping in to give a little love to all my late night cohorts. Hoping everyone has something to do this week and enjoy the weather if it&#039;s nice out. Take a break from the rails if you can and smell the roses. You&#039;ll always remember the little stuff in life.<br /><br />And onion, heed the advice of others and don&#039;t let our hypocritical nature make you tune us out. It&#039;s best to leave the great white for times of special occasion or when wanting to enjoy a night with friends, it gets the mood and words flowing like a tap. And I can speak from experience that sometimes this isn&#039;t the best thing. You don&#039;t want to regret anything you said or did. <br />So please respect the power that lays in the line.<br /><br /><br />A great line from a great comic.<br /><br />&quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;

Are cut up beyond recognition sadly. The 70% is around, but not from street vendors. The +80% is more and more rare the past 3 years. And the price on that in Scandinavia is 160-290 Euro a G. <br /><br />In Spain and Portugal though. Sooo much cheaper. <br /><br />It&#039;s all about patience when looking for good coke abroad. Even when I was working in China, I managed to find a decent quality of cocaine. Took me a long time. With a lot of hit n&#039; misses. But finally I found my 65-70% coke. And yes damnit! I am kinda proud that I was able to get that in a country where trafficers/dealers get the death sentence if they have 20 grams or more on them.<br />I shouldn&#039;t be proud of that, I know. <br />But keep this in mind: Having the best quality coke around, can open doors for ya at any business lunch ;)<br />Network network network!!

For some reason I don&#039;t respond like I should at cocaine nor amphetamines. I have been on wellbutrin (some sort of antidepresant) for a year untill 3 weeks ago, and maybe the culprit is there. I hope this changes quickly because I&#039;m not experiencing that much fun on those drugs. And still I&#039;ve bought for like 600 euro&#039;s last couple of 3 weeks&nbsp; :-[ After this weekend I&#039;m gonna wait a couple of weeks and see if it&#039;s better than. If not, than I&#039;m fucked. <br /><br />But, I don&#039;t think the quality is that bad where I live. Wish I could compare it to Bungee54s. But next week I will bring bungee54s coke to a lab and have it tested. then we&#039;ll know for certain if it&#039;s quality product or not.

Wellbutrin is different because it isnt an SSRI it is an aminoketone. It is believed to balance the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It is frequently is prescribed to people with ADHD as well as depression. It has a stimulant effect so thats why it is also used to treat ADHD and why it is different from other SSRIs. and this is really why when your doing things like coke along with your meds, your brains chemistry is already being regulated by the Wellbutrin... <br /><br />it took me about 2-3 months totally off med&#039;s before i could get that &quot;feel good&quot; high from Cocaine again... so best advice just be patient

				Hey all y&#039;all peeps! MONDAY morning here. Woot woot!<br /><br />Been tootin on some 10toes cola over the weekend. Have a bunch of comments towards it, but I am not experienced enough in the field to give an accurate review. Maybe y&#039;all can probe the quality out of my with various questions. I dunno! <br /><br />It has a bitter taste, it doesn&#039;t burn going down. Uhm. It gives me some goobers the next day, even after good nasal rinses. It dissolves between my fingers into an oily film, although I noticed a couple clear shards lingering about afterwards...<br /><br />But ya! This isn&#039;t a review, just a spew! :)<br /><br />Hope you guys are good. My spacewranger, btcltd, and one other that passes my mind at the moment should be coming this week! ha! <br /><br />-onion-

				I used to be a binger way back when. And mixed a lot--booze, weed, coke, benzos, etc.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m much more of a moderate user of all of the above :) I can&#039;t find any decent coke on the streets where I&#039;m from (we&#039;re known more for being a methtown than anything... and I&#039;ve never tried nor do I intend to try meth unless it&#039;s Desoxyn) so it&#039;s only recently that I started having it around again after years of not touching it.<br /><br />My favorite way to have it is as a social lubricant, to be honest, something other than weed and booze when friends come over before going out. I don&#039;t drink with it anymore even though it feels amazing because drinking and coke leads to me binging on both :) I never do more than 200mg in one session and that amount is taken over a course of 3 hours or so. I find that this allows me to sleep fine at night without any downers... I like sharing... so I actually love being around my gakked out friends but being the least gakked out. Does that make any sense?<br /><br />I&#039;ve learned to stop chasing that elusive first euphoric high and enjoy coke for the feelings it gives me now. I&#039;m a big fan of less is more... I used to love feeling gakked out but now I absolutely hate hate hate it. I find that lines, depending on quality of coke, of 30-50mg have me chatty and feeling great but when it wears off there&#039;s no sudden fall-off, just a transition into another part of the day/night.<br /><br />Lately I&#039;ve been tooting more than I usually do :) Not in terms of amount but in terms of frequency. I&#039;m not averse on a super busy day to having a small line during a break and then getting back to work. I&#039;ve had coke use creep up on me before so I find that, at the end of the day (or the next morning), i always have to ask myself whether or not I&#039;d do it again. Years ago during my binging it would always surely be a NO I WOUDLNT because I&#039;d be near-catatonic during the awful crashes after a night of doing a few grams. Whereas coke used to be the main event for me,&nbsp; now coke is merely an enhancer of things that are already fun/meaningful.<br /><br />So, I guess to answer your question, I don&#039;t like hard and fast rules like &quot;never do it back to back days&quot; &quot;even doing it once a week will get you addicted.&quot; The thing is: I HAVE been addicted to coke before, and I&#039;ve gotten off it. Other than being lethargic and having a fucked up sleep schedule for a week or so, there haven&#039;t been any ill side effects. The last half year that I&#039;ve had coke around, sometimes I&#039;ll go a month without it, sometimes I&#039;ll do it 3 times in one week. As long as it sort of goes with how I&#039;m feeling at the moment instead of taking over the moment, that&#039;s the way I like it&nbsp; :D<br /><br />

I do take couple of mg clonazepam, but always only at 4-5 lol. It hasn&#039;t been coke all the time though (6apb, coke and mdma)<br /><br />And my clonazepam is almost to its end so i have to source it via SR, which kinda sucks because at the pharmacist it costs about 5 euro and on SR about 60 :D but my psychiatrist nor doctors will give me a prescription this soon again as they know that I abuse everything :) <br /><br />The most important part frm this post is marked in bold (edit: it&#039;s the top sentence since the forum apparently doesn&#039;t show bold fonts&nbsp; ???

				&nbsp;:o damn, did I have a fucking shitty day.<br /><br />Typed a long story but edited and made it shorter to prevent revealing too much<br /><br />So I wanted to get Bungee54 coke tested as well as some local coke. the latter I still had to buy before I left. My main guy didn&#039;t respond and my second neither at first. The second did came through after an hour and a half (I only had three hours before my train left). Had my scale with me as only 100mg is required to hand in. The remain of the gram I just snorted where I was and on the train. An hour before I was to leave my first guy responds so I thought what the hell, I&#039;ll buy another and save it for tonight when I go home. As you probably know, dealers aren&#039;t known for their punctuality. Then some other things happened which I can&#039;t reveal but I didn&#039;t want to cross the border with a whole gram so I hid it somewhere (from my main guy). A lot went wrong and I had really no fucking luck today. I arrived two hours later than expected so I couldn&#039;t get to the second test centre (as they only allow one sample). I had to freaking run my ass off and was my whole body was sweating like a motherfucker. The guy almost didn&#039;t wanted to let me in because I arrived exactly at closing hour. Luckily he did take my sample. Else all this shit would&#039;ve been for nothing.<br /><br />When I travel back, MY FUCKING COKE IS GONE. can&#039;t really imagine how anyone could&#039;ve found it&nbsp; :-\<br />Was kinda pissed so just ordered another gram before going home. <br /><br />Then the good part came because when I opened my mailbox my package from bcpltd arrived.<br /><br />djezusssssssssssss wasted some money.<br /><br />edit: just did a line of bcpltd coke and although my brains still aren&#039;t functioning as they should, I can pretty much tell that this is quality gear. Great consistency and the smell and taste are exactly as they are supposed to be. If I manage to save 100mg of it, i will probably bring in to the lab somewhere in the near future.

I kind of always thought there had to be more to coke than the shitty buzz from the local shit but the very odd time it was OK.<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to control the amount I do or time I do it as I find if I have it around I&#039;ll trick myself into &quot;trying it out to see what it&#039;s like&quot; and then I can&#039;t stop.

I&#039;m trying to control my fiending and to learn to take .25 for a night and leave it at that for a couple of weeks or even month if possible but that&#039;s easier said than done because as you know yourself, it&#039;s a beautiful thing snorting a juicy white glistening line of goodness!!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />P.S. Just to add, I&#039;m always thinking of the bloody stuff too!!!&nbsp; ;D Love it&nbsp; :)

				In the past I always used my own notes, however since I started again we practically all share the same note (and it&#039;s always mine :p) and we&#039;re with a group of 5-8, so that&#039;s a lot of noses ! quite unsanitary actually. And there&#039;s this one guy whos ocassionally there and after snorting with my note, he also puts it into his mouth ::)<br /><br />As for the type user I am; I&#039;m a binger and CANNOT stay off it; never could. Normally I only do it in the weekends starting Friday evening and I always end up ordering 3-4 grams which I use throughout the weekend. About two grams on the friday evening but that&#039;s also because I share quite a lot with my friends.&nbsp;

				I also contemplated buying such a snorter; However the most part of my cocaine use is not at home and I&#039;m not going to run around with a special made cocaine snorter in my pockets. <br /><br />The fun thing about a note that is continually used by lots of people who do not unroll it afterwards is that at some point you can snort a decent amount. This happened this morning; I unrolled it at home before leaving and luckily this was above my table and a bunch of coke fell out. I weighted it and it was a good 80mg :D<br /><br />@white out: what is the correct phrase then ? As you noticed English isn&#039;t my native language and I literally translated it from dutch ( Een lijntje doen/ ik deed een lijn = doing a (small) line// I did a line )

Still very good shit. Really happy about this, can&#039;t say it enough. <br /><br />This morning a big chunk of one of my teeth broke off. I guess the coke is to be blamed for this. anyone else had this issue before ( I did in the past and it caused the worst pain I ever felt. Someone the cocaine got in/under/or whatever the tooth and got infected with an abscess or something alike. Djezus couldn&#039;t sleep for days and dentist wasn&#039;t available right away. But back than I always put the empty seal/bag in my mouth for the cocaine taste; i think that&#039;s the culprit.

At home I weighted it and I was quite stunned I must say.<br />==&gt; 0.65g !!!! :o<br />couple of days ago from another guy it was also only 0.75, but 0.65 is really shitty. Once you go lower than 0.75 you&#039;re practically buy fining half a gram. Now I will also go test his coke and after having tasted bcpltds coke and if I get other good results back from EU based SR vendors I&#039;m never buying local again. fcking dealers :D

				Wow, am amazed at all these functional cocaine users around these parts!<br /><br />My usage is strictly party time only. I wouldn&#039;t even entertain using without having at least a gram of hq to myself. A line or two is neither here nor there to me, unfortunately perhaps I don&#039;t see coke as a functional drug at all, no sir. I couldn&#039;t go to work on it or anything remotely like that, the good stuff is far too euphoric for me to be in a mundane situation on it.<br /><br />Love to party on my own, with a mate or two, or ideally with a sexy lady (me and the ex were mad for it). Only roa&#039;s for me are insufflated or freebased and smoked, mmm. Been using around 25 years, tis just a monthly thing thesedays due to the longer age-related recovery times.

				Hey All! Can&#039;t wait to be apart of the show. Let&#039;s just say I&#039;ve been out of the country (USA) for some months and coming home very soon. I have a few packages awaiting my return that I&#039;m very, very anxious to dig into - stuff from Nod and Pablo. I searched out SR specifically for some great cola. It&#039;s definitely my DoC!

				My Cocaine Plugging Odyssey.<br />Subtitled: Guide to plugging for the anally retentive.<br /><br />I have to share this weird journey with someone and the late night cocaine thread seems the perfect place.<br /><br />SR supplied me with amazing cola, its Saturday afternoon and tonight I am planning to rock.<br />Problem.

YOU&#039;VE GOT TO BE JOKING!!!!!!<br /><br />After the initial panic wears off I figure, that I am abusing my body anyway, I really want to get high,&nbsp; and maybe I should get over it and give it a try.

IS THAT BLOOD? ??????(vomits).<br /><br />Read some more from forums<br /><br />Attempt #2 – 5mm Syringe. I go to the store and ask for one.... make up some immense story about needing it to oil a door hinge. I don&#039;t know why I bothered. No one in that store believes I am anything other than a drug addict from now on. And they would not be wrong. Hmm it looks thin enough, certainly I pass stools bigger than that. OK here we go....

I told Rectum I was not kidding around any more. But while I was there saw my salvation. <br />Micro-enemas. <br />These are 5mm single dose enema solutions for people with severe constipation. The applicator is designed for plugging. One look at it and I knew that Rectum would be unable to stop me.<br /><br />Attempt #3 –&nbsp; Micro-enema.

				^^^The problem with bombing is that the bioavailability of cocaine is extremely low when eaten, whereas when plugged it is greater than snorting even.<br /><br />Otherwise we&#039;d all just be munching coke on toast instead of sniffing it!

Good idea mate&nbsp; ;) It&#039;s always a little awkward though, especially getting the syringe back out, cus ur arse kinda wants to flop it out.<br /><br />I&#039;m also out of benzo&#039;s so can&#039;t keep snorting at night anymore ! <br /><br />In the weekends I still live at my parents and they kinda suspect that i&#039;m back on drugs cuz well you know you can look weird when ur on cocaine. Furthermore when you&#039;re running around the house late a night with a giant kitchen knife cuz you&#039;re freaking paranoid that doesn&#039;t really help :p<br /><br />EDIT: 5 min after posting this I started bleeding&nbsp; :-[<br />

Years ago I used to use everyday and spent a LOT of $ doing that. Now I find it&#039;s so much more enjoyable if I do it occasionally... A good diet and exercise in between sessions of any drug that affects dopamine (or serotonin like molly) does WONDERS. The brain adapts to stims and down-regulates your dopamine production... I find that tolerance builds quick as fuck w/ coke. But a good few days of rest and exercise seem to jump start the dopamine production again--I get high as fuck off of even a tiny amount of coke after a week of being healthy. Is it bad that most of the time I exercise with one of the goals being that I&#039;ll get that much higher when I do drugs over the weekend? :)<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong :) Sometimes if I get some goooood stuff, I&#039;ll still toot on consecutive days until it&#039;s gone, but more often than not to save $$ I tend to be moderate about it.<br /><br />Take care of yourself Suidone!!!

Endorphins (&#039;til recently, I never knew that it actually stood for endogenous morphine) are god&#039;s gift to us. So when I&#039;m asked whether or not I do opiates usually I answer... Yes, yes, I do, a few times a year BUT technically, each time I work out or run, the point is precisely to mine my own body for its natural opiates =D You should see me the month before a music festival. I lay the foundation for my future getting-high-as-fuck by exercising like a maniac, veggies/fruits up the wazoo... and come time for game time... holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiet... Makes comedowns a lot less rough, too. <br /><br />I&#039;m not a natural exerciser though. Used to be obese, had a lot of problems with daytime fatigue... loved sugar and salt and fast food, smoked a pack a day, 4-5 joints a day etc. Also have dealt with (still dealing with) depression. But after my first acid trip a few years ago... I realized in this can&#039;t-put-into-words way how much more amazing drugs--or anything, for that matter--would be if I took care of precisely the things which interact with the drugs to produce the high--my body and my brain. That drugs are an enhancement of life, not an escape from it.<br /><br />Anyhow--I&#039;m going to shut the fuck up now. Any time I start talking about this I always fear that I&#039;m going to turn out sounding like some evangelizing health fanatic that&#039;s trying to get everybody to get in shape and &quot;feel better about themselves&quot;. You know those people... the ones that spend their lives in the gym and look down on anyone that DARES to eat fast food. fuck those hypocrites, who obsess over their health at the expense of everything else. Nah, that&#039;s not the point... it&#039;s more that I truly and deeply believe in responsible drug use and everybody&#039;s right to it... and I realized years ago that responsible drug use, in my personal worldview, doesn&#039;t only involve the drugs themselves, but what I do with myself precisely when I&#039;m not getting high... Life is fucking beautiful because of the variety of experiences and sensations available to us. I enjoy being sober the next day as much as I enjoy getting high as fuck today. It&#039;s all about enjoying the contrasts between the two states. <br /><br />Peace out y&#039;all! Hope you&#039;re all having a wonderful week.<br /><br />~ozy

				Alright, did some researching and started also thinking about things so I came to a couple of conclusions (dunno if they&#039;re correct, but it&#039;s possible).<br /><br />So I blew another G through my nose yesterday without really feeling any positive effects; however the paranoia is always present and my pupils are dilated. So there was definitely cocaine in my system.<br />Because of my hay fever and doing so much coke I overused dexa rhino spray, which most likely did fuck up my nose and closes my mucus membranes to absorb the cocaine to a certain extent. This nasal spray did work great to get my nose unclogged, but it thus appears that over usage is really bad. Did some researching and found that some corticosteroids nasal sprays are the best treatment to relieve me from this hindrance for joy. Luckily I happen to have some of those also for my hay fever. This will take a while, but my nose is already feeling better and i&#039;m also using some saline solution throughout the day for better recovery. <br /><br />This couldn&#039;t however been the main reason why I couldn&#039;t get remotely high, because I tried plugging the cocaine yesterday evening and again, no effects except pupil dilation and increased heartbeat. but non positive effects whatsoever. Luckily I had my klonnies to get to sleep and at 2AM I finally slept; this morning I woke up kinda fine and immediately took my concerta (methylphenidate) which I have been taking daily for years except last couple of weeks. I kinda think that concerta counters any withdrawal effects from the cocaine.<br /><br />Now the actual reason why I couldn&#039;t get high anymore is most likely mentioned by one of u guys: I&#039;ve been using way too much cocaine non stop for maybe 2 weeks consecutive, barely sleeping and last but not least, my diet has been SHIT. I haven&#039;t eaten any fruits or getting vitamines whatsoever. I think I had diner 3 times last 10 days. Never had breakfast except for a bottle of chocolate milk. Finally had 2-3 times lunch past 10 days which consisted of 2 times mcdonalds and one time some sandwiches. Haven&#039;t been exercising either etc.. <br /><br />so if you take all the above mentioned shit together it prolly ain&#039;t that much of a surprise that I wasn&#039;t responding fine. And today I actually felt pretty good.&nbsp; Wake up, eat some fruit, got some multivitamins. Took the concerta, no paranoia, i&#039;m awake, no cravings and nose is already starting to get better :D&nbsp; <br /><br />So I&#039;m definitely gonna stay of the coke for a couple of days/ a week and start getting healthy again. <br /><br />I was a little surprised though because when I was about 16-17 years old I also used daily for months and never experienced any troubles. The difference with back then is that I was young, eating&nbsp; better since I still lived at home, got more sleep and I was in the prime of my life as I was competing on international level at some sport. <br /><br />Talk to ya later in couple of days :D<br />

				Yep you&#039;ve reached your peak and just experiencing toxicity from it all.<br /><br />Thank your body for all the pleasure it has given you in the past, and start eating right.<br />If you can be somewhere without driving, then walk if you can.<br /><br />Drink lots of water.<br /><br />Eat some fish, and vegetables, steak, pasta, etc.<br /><br />Then after a good week or two, your next line should and will be much more enjoyable. :P ;D<br />Take care of you. +1. ;)

				Everyday for two weeks is way too much in my opinion<br /><br />You enjoy coke more when you have a little every now and then<br /><br />My definition of every now and then is once every couple of weeks but lately ive been having it once a week and i sometimes feel thats also too much<br /><br />It suppresses appetite and you loose sleep which i think is the most harmful part of it<br /><br />If you can learn to exercise, eat well and have enough sleep then you will enjoy your coke more<br /><br />Dont let it take control of you

				Traveled bout 12 hours today to get some a couple of coke samples tested at the lab; now they told me it&#039;s possible that it won&#039;t get tested due to financial restrictions&nbsp; :o I really hope my samples get tested !!! i&#039;m not spilling 12 hours to get nothing in return. <br /><br />Again, similar to last week, I arrived late due to public transportation; some bus driver dropped me off at the wrong place. As I couldn&#039;t really see where I was and where I had to go I asked some guy who also got of the bus if he could gimme directions to this particular street. He told me I was way off course. Next he asked me what I was doing here and I simply told him that I wanted to get my coke tested (he was between 25-30 years old, non Caucasian male and there didn&#039;t seem anything wrong with him so why not ;))&nbsp; ::) He couldn&#039;t really explain which route I had to take, but he was friendly enough to get his cell and look for it on his navigation system app. I only had like 10 minutes left to get there and I would never make it by foot. By chance his car was parked nearby and he immediately gave me a ride to my actual destination (which really wasn&#039;t close). GOOD PEOPLE DO EXIST !&nbsp; 8) !!!! I expressed eternal gratitude to this very kind man. I wanted to give him some money but only had a 200 € note on me and was in a hurry so couldn&#039;t really give em that :p<br /><br />btw when I told him about that I was getting my coke tested, he asked me whether I was a Jehovah witness ??? lol: didn&#039;t really understand why he asked me this (I look very regular :D ) anyone sees a connection between jehovas withnesses and drugs ? :D

				Still haven&#039;t taken a break yet, but I&#039;ll have a clean break from tomorrow off for at least a full week ! HAHA, sound familiar :p&nbsp; but i&#039;m serious now !<br />btw: dunno if u follow pineapples thread about the coke test results and read about Bungee54 results announced yesterday&nbsp; :o (by me and Pineapple)<br /><br /><br />Now I&#039;m a really skeptical person and I&#039;m always suspicious of reviews on SR and those in the cocaine thread. I practically never trust what people say, unless they are really highly respected, and even then I have problems trusting their statements unless maybe supported by numerous other respected members. The regulars keeping this thread alive though and chit chatting bout all other shit, I do have more faith in. So GO GO MB coke talk show.<br /><br />Now about those results from Bungee54s cocaine; his cocaine was tested by agreement by Pineapple and by me (anonymous). <br />So his &quot; Peruvian ... cocaine &quot; tested at 87 % purity, which is the highest quality seen by me since i&#039;ve been reading this forum and I didn&#039;t really believed that this was possible in retail. There were other + 80 % results some while back, but those were tested by agreement so that&#039;s something I&#039;d never trust :D<br /><br />And okay, there was always the possibility that Pineapple was affiliated or funded by some vendor to post fake results etc.. But I couldn&#039;t really find any indications for this to be true. But now I had the product tested myself and Pineapple had same results, which are both unbelievably high. I&#039;ve also been talking with Pineapple cuz he wanted to make sure that I didn&#039;t cheat myself with the results I posted and I&#039;m pretty convinced now that he&#039;s a stand up guy. <br /><br />In this case I dropped it off at the lab, so when I would get the results, i&#039;d be 100 % sure of what I actually bought (coke/cuts/etc.). When I actually heard them I was kinda confused/shocked as I would never had expected this. It was really hard to believe; in particular because we&#039;ve been getting some real shitty results lately and after a while you kinda lose hope.<br />All I can say now is try Bungee54s coke. It&#039;s expensive indeed, but if he doesn&#039;t start cutting his product it&#039;s really worth it; I&#039;d recommend to order just one gram and then you can tell for yourself. If you buy larger amounts than you will be really saving lots of money actually. I kinda hate that I now sound like I&#039;m getting paid or working for Bungee54 himself, cus when I read people saying what I just said, I&#039;d be very suspicious haha :D<br /><br />You guys are probably starting to get an idea what kind of person I am, and cus I blow a lot through my nose I really want quality and his bulk prices are very reasonable for this quality. That&#039;s all why I&#039;m doing this for ! <br /><br />If u didn&#039;t read the test result thread, i tell u guys in here; The cocaine Bungee has is a new batch since couple of weeks, so I was one of the first buyers of this new batch. As a result, there&#039;s always the possibility that he first sends his uncut product and afterwards starts cutting when results come back. I&#039;m certainly not accusing Bungee54 that such practices will happen, but u never know. Therefore I will have his coke tested again by various SR accounts AND concurrently larger orders in order to make sure that he also doesn&#039;t start cutting the product when people buy 5/10/20/... grams. <br /><br />Finally :D as I&#039;m kinda of a blabbermouth there is a possibility that he knows who had his product tested, so he could keep sending his uncut product to whoever I am. Therefore future test results will be ordered by 1) other SR accounts 2) larger quantities and 3) but also different addresses in various EU countries. <br /><br />I think this is the best way to ensure we really get what we should get and that&#039;s motherfucking HQ cocaine :D<br /><br />And although I&#039;m totally anonymous here and nothing can happen to me (except neg. rep :D), I am NOT badmouthing or accusing Bungee54 of future scamming or cutting his product now the results came in. All I want to is have a steady HQ cocaine supplier. So I apologize if U feel offended by all measures I am taking and announcing on here to prevent me (and others :p) to get scammed or get lower quality.<br /><br />Since some might perceive what I&#039;m saying as quite negative (except for the results), I&#039;d like to stress the following (in quotes as can&#039;t seem to get something in bold)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I only had positive experiences with this vendor and I&#039;m extremely thankful that he provides such a cocaine; so right now all I can do is recommend him and say he is a top vendor, with probably the best cocaine </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Damn, went away a couple of days to one of the places I usually reside and just came back to where I had my Lexq cocaine sent to so I was really hoping to have this nice surprise in my mailbox.... Nothing&nbsp; :( <br />Kinda disappointed as it&#039;s been over 13 days, but of course it&#039;s overseas (Canada) and there have been 2 extra holidays during this period so I guess it&#039;s not unusual that it hasn&#039;t arrived yet. Still really hoped it would be there after being 5 days away :)&nbsp; <br /><br />There&#039;s a silver lining (in some way) cuz this also means i&#039;ve been 2 full days without cocaine :D<br />nose has been really content&nbsp; :P<br /><br />

				Lexqs package arrived today, woopieee. I won&#039;t comment on the quality, but can say that it&#039;s rather waxy and smell is also good though.It will also be tested so the results will be back next friday (31st may).<br />What I definitely must mention here is that his stealth is really sick; packages from other vendor were medium to good, but gotta say I was really impressed. I&#039;d never have any doubts ordering from him again cuz it&#039;s magic :p

Glad to see your&#039;e enjoying GoA... I may have to give him a try some time. I always manage to skip over him and 10Toes, for some reason. In other news...got another little treat from bcpltd today. Decent batch. Seems a whole bunch of cola vendors are going on vacay. Nod, bcpltd (soon), and MarloStanfield. I find it...somewhat weird that the day that the highest price H and cola vendor goes into stealth (Nod), DragonCove comes back (also really pricy H and cola). Who knows how the vendors work things out in their little roundtable.<br /><br />It&#039;s nice to see a whole crop of new C vendors emerging though... priceisright, Jean Ralphio, and CannaConnection (murda and I will be getting samples from Canna). Also PureOrganx... and then some dude who took a product photo with a fucking Mario action figure. \(o_O)/ Kind of awesome, haha.<br /><br />Good to see some better price points, too. Just for shits and giggles I ordered a .50g from Jean Ralphio. Gonna get some from priceisright too just to see. Lastly, waiting on some gear from Marlo... decent price... $140 for 1.7g. <br /><br />Happy days ahead! Hope you are all well in mind, body, and soul. Sounds fucking cheesy but I mean it.<br /><br />~ozy<br /><br />PS - SUIDONE: Keep us posted on bcpltd test results and how LexQ turned out for you.

OR the yayo could be completely garbage or your tolerance is so high you need gram lines to get you going.<br /><br />What is more enjoyable , doing yayo or being on a anti depressant to function? You must make the decision. Also doing yayo and Welbutrin would raise your risk of seizures significantly. This could be a blessing in disguise to stop you from using yayo or if you want to keep using considering dropping the anti d as stated. Asking doctors will not get you anywhere.

Maybe more important is that it was that event that caused me to quit on all drugs, alcohol and even cigarettes. I fell off the boat again just recently but doesn&#039;t really matter. <br /><br />I guess lots of people have experienced crazy shit though cuz that what happens when u use drugs :D Still when taking into account all the people I know, I&#039;ve prolly crossed the line too many times and much too far when it comes to drugs; which isn&#039;t really something to be proud of actually. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">It sounds like you have severely depleted all your neurotransmitters .... but there is a way to fix this&nbsp; .. using amino acids and other supplements<br /><br />&nbsp;this dude really knows what he&#039;s talking about ..... http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5340017-how-to-quit-without-feeling-s-t<br /><br /><br />BEST book I&#039;ve ever read&nbsp; on the subject , enjoy!<br /><br /><br />m m&nbsp; m motek</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah, I really think that must be it; i&#039;ll read your book these days ! thanks for the link. <br /><br />Since friday I started to eat frequently and healthy again so that&#039;s a good start for sure. I&#039;m always hungry and often wake up with chocolate cookies in my mouth and all over my sheets&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Did some powertraining for the first time in months. Damn I lost almost all my strength; which isn&#039;t that surprising I suppose<br /><br /><br />Anyways, thanks again for the support and the advice guys.<br /><br />I&#039;m working on something that&#039;ll be released for a certain audience within the first weeks of july, so if I&#039;m still have access to the forums and aren&#039;t stuck in the loony bin again or something like that, maybe i post parts of it here too. still haven&#039;t figured it all out yet but it&#039;ll give you a glimpse of the life of a bipolar young adult :D

				Suidone , I have seen so many doctors , phsychatrists , physchologists , mental health doctors in hospitals for assistance regarding depression. Only thing that helped was Prozac then it pooped. Now I use recreational drugs they help and when I am not on them thinking about using them gets me excited and motivated.<br /><br />Ok apply cream to your eyes so you don&#039;t get bags under your eyes from continued use. Buy fish oil , Multi vitamin and coq10 which are all good supplements and will improve your physical and mental health and your appearance. Now the nose bleeding (I think I read that) is a real concern considering you state you are using good quality gear. You may just need a break man.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know , get some good quality sleep , good supplements even a calcium and vitamin D supp if you lack sun exposure. If meth heads can get high and stay up for 7 days , sleep for 3 then repeat with rubbish nutrition and horrible self care procedures but still get high (they just have to up there dose in relation to tolerance which is normal) then something is wrong man.<br /><br />Doctors in my experience judge you , they think you will be violent , they are cautious writing out scripts and will always be suss about you. Heres hoping to show significant improvement soon.<br /><br />PM me if you need help regarding depression , been suffering since I was 17. Know a lot about pharmaecueticals and what they do as well. By looking healthier on the outside means the inside is better and the high should be better.

C. Also got me a lot of salmon and am using my diet again from when I was a powerlifter, only added more fruit now. The nosebleeds are insignificant cuz they were from using local cocaine. Bungee54s and IBMs cocaine are really a treat for the nose. Goes really smooth up the nose, no clogging of any kind etc.. <br /><br />Unfortunately I don&#039;t think there&#039;s much to be done bout my depression. Although I&#039;m out of it now, it will return without a doubt. My wellbutrin did the job quite good, cuz I didn&#039;t really felt depressed but I wasn&#039;t functioning as good as when not depressed(concentration, motivation to sport...). SSRI&#039;s are in general out of the question cuz i&#039;ve got to much adverse effects from them. Bupropion is a stimulant, while SSRIs or SNRIs in general keep me in bed all day. I&#039;ve also been on lithium, but wasn&#039;t fit either; Abilify (Aripiprazol = atypical antipsychotic) helped with the hypomania, but that&#039;s the fun part of the disorder so being bipolar kinda sicks. So soon I&#039;ll try the lamictal which should prevent future depressions. Some people respond great and can almost function completely normal, others are in the middle and others are just fucked for life. still bipolar sucks in any case unless you&#039;re the type that has more and longer (hypo)manic episodes than depressions.<br /><br />I&#039;m almost 3 days off but still have trouble getting to sleep before 2 A.M even when taking xanax or clonazepam; but i&#039;m gonna try to quit those too while i&#039;m off cocaine. We&#039;ll see how it works out.

				&quot;Symbious&quot; UK vendor has good charlie. Took some today (fri morn) now had to take some mephedrone orally so I can at least be productive for the rest of the day to override the comedown. Coke really isn&#039;t getting old. Inconsistant product , expensive and totally non functional. How do people use this when they go out? Run away every 45 mins to top up with a line? How counter productive. At least low dose amphet you can get things done. I don&#039;t mind the depression with coke comedown it is the CNS fatigue that follows which makes me completely useless , I lay there tired , depressed and unable to do anything :(<br /><br />Just took some mephedrone orally , at least it will get me through the day , first experience with it.

				Just do coke in a social setting at someones house while bumping lines and chatting/sipping drinks. At the end of the night when you know you might crash and burn, pop some xanax and get zonked out, you completely miss the whole come down thing of it.<br /><br />Some may say mixing them all together is dangerous and not for everyone, but I find for me, It&#039;s best If I don&#039;t have anything else to indulge in, that I like to fall asleep quickly after my last rail, that way I wake up feeling like a new man and without the hassle of the depressing crash.<br /><br />Also try to take smaller lines or just go with &quot;bumps&quot; throughout the night, that way you don&#039;t coke-overide the system and your body is just pleasantly high instead of fiending for line after line. It&#039;s a more enjoyable high if you start off right and don&#039;t completely waste it by trying to chase some mythical feeling of euphoria.

Furthermore, the stress from rigorous exercise forces the various bodily systems to work and communicate together (renal, hepatic, etc. etc.) in a way that is almost a &quot;rehearsal&quot; for dealing with stress when you&#039;re *not* exercising. I speak from my own experience, as I also suffer from depression, and regular exercise is one of the cornerstones of keeping myself healthy.<br /><br />Like I&#039;ve said earlier in this thread--I always find that working out rigorously promotes and potentiates my being able to get high as fuck off drugs in general, be it cannabis, cocaine, heroin, etc.<br /><br />And, at the end of the day... evolutionarily speaking--we were born to move, baby :)<br /><br />Good luck, Suidone!<br /><br />And best wishes to all of you on this thread... hope you all have a great weekend. It&#039;s fucking going to be 105 degrees in my neck of the woods this weekend. Time for morning runs, afternoon poolside margaritas, and nighttime RAILS :)<br /><br />Good luck Suidone.

Also a few local vendors here on SR sold decent yay but price is crazy so I ventured OS more recently and got off a well known US vendor and a UK vendor. 2G&#039;s of US yay and 1g of UK yay which should have lasted me ages if it is good. I mean 1g of tetravorts lasted me 2 weeks.....1 line would keep you buzzing for a good hour with NO comedown I mean you just float back to baseline and continue life even the fatigue due to CNS being so stimulated was so minute.<br /><br />Got through the 2g&#039;s of the US stuff in 1 night , smelt great but that is about it. I ended up doing monster lines and even smoked some off alfoil to get where I wanted all i got was a fuckd up nose and hard time to sleep but it was pretty cheap considering AUS prices so I wasn&#039;t that angry and the vendor is a gentleman I just put it down to inconsistancy of yay and perhaps I expect to much when some of us have had the luxury to experience some life altering mind blowing cocaine?<br /><br />1g of UK stuff was ok but I won&#039;t be in a rush to purchase again. Just underwhelmed by it all the best thing about coke should be such the short duration. Start taking about 6pm for 3-4 hours then pop a benzo or oxy if you are lucky then go off to sleep and I never have a hangover or depression from coke unlike other stuff just a bit of a stuffy nose and dark eyes.<br /><br />So yeah...that is my experience but you know what...I will prob again purchase in due course just because there is that slight chance I may get that experience I have felt with tetravorts and a few others which is the most pleasurable feeling as a human being you can have.

				When I first discoverd SR, it I thought of it as a magical place. Since I was primarly searching for coke, it didn&#039;t take too long before I got disappointed. Prices were way to high for the quality of the product; We did stumble upon a couple of exceptional high quality, uncut cocaine. Now that kinda sucked, cus it&#039;d never pay over 100 euro/ gram (130 $). <br /><br />However when you order a somewhat larger quantity (+20 gram) you actually <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">save</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> money compared to when you buy your cocaine on the streets (this depends of course what the average quality and price is in your region. Belgiums cocaine price is always 50 euro; average quality is between 40-60 % ( so lets say 50 % )<br /><br />Bungee54 or IMB sell 1 oz for about 75 euro/gram (100 dollar); now I noticed last couple of times I bought from the street that most dealers only give between 0.65-0.75gr.&nbsp; So 30 gram bought via SR is actually 40 gram on the street (30/0,75); if you make the math, you only pay 250 euro extra when buying via SR. <br /><br />Furthermore , the quality is almost or maybe double than the street cocaine ( if the respective SR vendors keep providing +80(resp. 87/89) % cocaine )<br /><br />So by buying bulk from the good vendors:<br />1. You&#039;re acually cheaper off<br />2. the cocaine is uncut, which is SOOOOOOOOOO much better for the nose; The difference is really insane (at least in my case); Note however that Bungee54s and IMBs cocaine al already very fine powder so you don&#039;t really have to chop it anymore, so maybe this also helps in keeping the nose &quot; healthy&quot;<br /><br />This is actually freaking great, but on two conditions I guess.<br />1. you&#039;re EU/UK customer; US et. al. prolly wouldn&#039;t be a problem either but there seems to be a major stumbling block for US customers to order cocaine (and certainly +1 Oz) internationally; which I think is unfounded because a lot more a larger amounts of MDMA do get ordered by US customers from EU buyers. <br />2. You have control over your usage or have external controls so that you don&#039;t blow it all up ur nose in 2 weeks.<br /><br /><br />Now I got my hands on a larger amount than usual and I know myself good enough that I&#039;m not strong enough to stay of the shit. So I planned to leave my whole stash at a place which I can&#039;t access in normal circumstances. My &#039;plan&#039; could only start today.<br /><br />This means I had quite some coke at hands since Friday. Because I have practically no control, certainly not over cocaine, I&#039;m still awake since Friday 8 AM and it&#039;s now Monday 9 AM. What is actually more stupid is, that I don&#039;t really feel the coke&nbsp; :-[ I can definitely feel the cocaine in my body, but there&#039;s just no euphoria or I&#039;m the king of the world feeling: can&#039;t explain what I feel but it feels more like it&#039;s therapeutical, but just a little better (like methylphenidate) I feel a little better ofcourse, but since my dopamine levels/system shot, the amounts I take are also way more than a normal person woluld do. In total I consumed about 5 grams since Friday afternoon until this morning. That&#039;s not extremely much, but since it&#039;s bout double the quality compared to our local cocain, it&#039;s really freaking much (for me). I didn&#039;t have the equipment to here to get my blood pressure checked, and I had the feeling ir was through the roof (cuz my had this typical high blood pressure headache).<br /><br />Just took 4mg klonopin and 4 mg xanax cus i&#039;m already experiencing signs of sleep deprivation (bugsssssss everywhereee!); <br /><br />So to conclude; my stash will be safe for at least 2-3 weeks :D<br />

				As soon as I vent my disgust with the coca scene as a whole here I am on a Monday night having a serious appetite for some cola. I swear preparing the stuff is just as addictive as the high that you &quot;sometimes&quot; get with good yay. Just like how people who IV they say they love preparing there &quot;rig&quot; for the shoot and when they &quot;register&quot; a vein how good that feels.<br /><br />Similar thing just not as detailed due to different procedure.

I just told him he should be active, and maintain communication with his testers and the thread he started. I wonder if it just hasn&#039;t gotten the attention because he was a new user, and I don&#039;t know how the new user thing works now with newbie threads and junk, but I believe they are limited to where they can post, correct? So that may explain the thread being somewhat minimal, but then again the vendor should be active. The other thing was Snow Patrol&#039;s listings are now inactive. I am not sure why someone would do this, unless he is simply waiting for the review feedback and orders to start flowing.

Actual disco enthusiast here too, specifically the more esoteric shit, or at least the shit that people my age (mid-30&#039;s) aren&#039;t even supposed to know about - Sylvester, Bohannon, Cerrone, Gino Soccio, Change, North End, etc etc etc. Love it. I&#039;m one of those douchebags that&#039;s nostalgic for a time that I never actually experienced. Now if only I could get ahold of some Ludes! I&#039;ve seen &#039;em on the road, but of course only from overseas, possibly-sketchy vendors. With my luck though, they&#039;d probably just knock me the fuck out and I wouldn&#039;t get any of that orgiastic experience my parents and 50+ year old friends tell me about. One such friend tells me her favorite combination back in the day was &quot;quaaludes, champagne, and cocaine.&quot; Perfect! <br /><br />Anyway, the blow that I&#039;m currently enjoying is from PureOrganx. Just thought I&#039;d mention it, since I haven&#039;t seen much talk about his cola on here at all, and it&#039;s definitely worth mentioning! One of the 2 best I&#039;ve ever had, up there with SpaceWrangler, who unfortunately went rogue. So if you were wondering about PO&#039;s stuff, it&#039;s PDS for sure. That is all!

I&#039;ll take Columbia anyday. Plus i think the cocaine was better in Columbia than when i was in Bolivia..... just my .2cents.

				I have to work tomorrow, but here I am doing some lines and eating leftover Thai food. Am I the only one who does some blow and then eats afterward? Is that weird? It&#039;s not that it makes me hungry, it&#039;s that I was already hungry beforehand. I can also do a few lines and then go to bed shortly thereafter, without any other pharmaceutical intervention, except maybe booze.<br /><br />As a chronic over-sharer, I often find myself wishing I could post my random coke-related musings on Facebook. But I guess this is the next best thing, so here are a couple status updates...<br /><br />I always make sure to put my coke-piled mirror out of the reach of my cat&#039;s wandering tail. He&#039;s always knocking over the vaporizer whip, which is annoying enough, but what a disaster it would be if he swept all my blow off the coffee table! One of these days I&#039;m gonna forget...<br /><br />Thank the gods for that Simply Saline nasal mist. Not only is it good for keeping things moist in there, but after a night of snorting shit that accumulates in my abundant forest of nose hair, a couple squirts of saline up each nostril is like doing a big extra bump.

Am I the only one who does some blow and then eats afterward? Is that weird? It&#039;s not that it makes me hungry, it&#039;s that I was already hungry beforehand. I can also do a few lines and then go to bed shortly thereafter, without any other pharmaceutical intervention, except maybe booze.<br /><br />As a chronic over-sharer, I often find myself wishing I could post my random coke-related musings on Facebook. But I guess this is the next best thing, so here are a couple status updates...<br /><br />I always make sure to put my coke-piled mirror out of the reach of my cat&#039;s wandering tail. He&#039;s always knocking over the vaporizer whip, which is annoying enough, but what a disaster it would be if he swept all my blow off the coffee table! One of these days I&#039;m gonna forget...<br /><br />Thank the gods for that Simply Saline nasal mist. Not only is it good for keeping things moist in there, but after a night of snorting shit that accumulates in my abundant forest of nose hair, a couple squirts of saline up each nostril is like doing a big extra bump. It washes all the trapped coke up to where it should be, and I&#039;m high all over again! Brilliant!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Likewise, I like a little liquid mist up the old shnozzer after some good rails. Saline? never tried it but it makes perfect sense. Going to try it next time.<br /><br />So much to learn from sharing.<br /><br />For example, I sometimes pop a diazepam at the end of a big binge to ease me into sleep, but I find myself a little sluggish in the morning. (which of course makes me crave for more rails). It gets worse if I do it on successive days. But the other day I tried some medical marijuana to come down and I didn&#039;t feel nearly as crap in the morning.<br /><br />How do you guys/gals come down. (Or do you never come down) :)

				Yeah, I usually pop a little Xanax or Valium to come down, but that can make it next to impossible to wake up in the morning if I have to be somewhere. And Valium makes me feel sluggish too, and kinda depressed for a whole day after I take it. Xanax is much nicer. I will vaporize a little weed which sometimes helps, but sometimes gets my heart racing even more. My friend makes a cannabis tincture that makes me sleep like a benzo would, but without the grogginess in the morning. <br /><br />And now for my Cokebook status update of the day:<br /><br />I should always remember to blow my chronically runny nose before doing a line, otherwise I end up snorting back a loogie that makes my throat so numb I can&#039;t swallow properly for 20-30 minutes. That really sucked.

				When I&#039;m running low I like to plan my next move a couple lines in advance so I know I am working towards an end goal, so I&#039;ll systematically pick a movie that makes sense at the times, then I make my warm ginger tea and get out a benzo. I&#039;ll spread a little weed butter on my toast and sit down to get ready for the ride back down to earth. Finish the budbutter toast and follow it with a benzo and some tea and make sure to enjoy the evening and everything life has to offer.

				I already can confirm that Studio54s PDS is great stuff. It seems to be up there with Bungee and IMBs coke. <br />I&#039;ve noticed the same characteristics with HQ cocaine: <br />- goes very smooth up the nose with little to no burning; <br />- no real nose clogging unless doing massive amounts :p<br />- a 100 mg line of pure coke looks double the amount of street cocaine; this is probably because it&#039;s all real powdery.<br />- Good taste, but not what I was used to. I thought good coke had this particular strong taste and numbing, but it seems that it&#039;s more subtle; <br />- doing massive amounts of pure coke makes your heart race and your blood pressure can go through the roof :D<br /><br /><br /><br />

Same nice clean taste, powdery and very smooth up the nose.

I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;ll be + 80 % cuz it tasted and felt even better than bungees stuff. Since 89 % is the max purity, it can&#039;t be that much better (than 87 %) and I doubt you can really notice a couple % purity; All three vendors cocaine tasted differently and the first two (Bungee/IMB) were only 2 % different in terms of purity; So i&#039;m really curious for the result.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />ATTENTION: <br /><br />Tonight I will have listings up on my SR Vendor page...

				Well, that was fast. Totally just lost my battle with willpower and did a couple lines. <br /><br />Also, wish I had some coins to get a hold of some of Studio&#039;s PDS. Sounds awesome! Maybe someday... I usually get about 1G a month. Luckily for my finances I&#039;m a lightweight.

				I ordered 1g of PDS last week from Studio54 which arrived today. Here&#039;s my initial feedback:<br /><br />5/5 Shipped on Friday received Monday. Initial communications were very good, I was informed exactly when it was shipped and the expected delivery date. Arrived the day Studio54 expected it to arrive. Packaging was extremely professional and stealth was perfect. It could easily have been opened by a family member or nosy housemate and they would have no idea what was inside even after poking through it. Easily good enough for international orders in my opinion. Once I got to it through several layers I can honestly say it looks fantastic! Shinny, flaky and scaly just how I love it, mainly large chunks. It smells good, I tasted a tiny bit of dust from the side of the pack and it tastes very strong. It had nice bit of numbing but not too much. I can&#039;t wait for a line as I can already tell it&#039;s going to be amazing! Fingers crossed Studio54 continues to provide the same product and service. I hope he&#039;ll have a good supply of this stuff otherwise he&#039;ll find himself constantly sold out. Get some when you can!!

				Incredibly I am lacking a coke high now to , I don&#039;t think it is the yay itself I am convinced it is me taking a dopamine agonist (cabergoline) I am in the same situation as that guy taking the wellbutrin. I don&#039;t get as high as I should but I don&#039;t comedown hard either. Shout out to KOTT , what a quality honest vendor. Perhaps I just need some super strong fish scale to really get me going to override the cabergoline effects.

				So I was expecting a package of some cola today, and I was totally sure it would be waiting for me in my mailbox when I got home. I was REALLY hoping for it, because I used the last of my stash last night, and I have a day off tomorrow. So I get home after work, and I look in my mailbox... EMPTY! So disappointed. But there was a glimmer of hope that maybe the mailman left it in front of my apartment door, which they sometimes do. I get up to my floor, look in front of my door. Nothing! I was so fuckin&#039; bummed, I was like, what am I gonna DO tonight? <br /><br />I get in my apartment, set my bike against the wall, turn the light on, feeling all bummed... start putting my stuff down, and then I look behind me and there&#039;s an envelope sitting there on the floor. That&#039;s it! They slipped it under my door! I went from bummed to psyched real quick! That little surprise pretty much made my night. And it&#039;s some of my favorite shit, too, from PureOrganix. <br /><br />Now the only question is what to do while I&#039;m doing it...

I won&#039;t go in to further detail but even from the outside I would be surprised if anyone opened it up to look inside. Even if they did, I was just as impressive. No blank printer paper here.... Studio54 has clearly taken time to research and made some investment.

We&#039;d start on a Monday and finish on a Friday with the weekend to recover. We&#039;d be out all night sometimes without going home between leaving work and going back in the morning. You can imagine how pissed I was when I changed jobs, moved away etc. and lost contact with everyone from back then! Now, when I think about it I feel extremely lucky to have experienced the best years of my life and actually survived the whole thing.

				Crazy to think that some middle east countries will lock you up for having codeine or even a product containing codeine. Enough for a joint means prison too! Can&#039;t think of the guys name but a big name DJ was passing through Bahrain (might have that part wrong) and had a small nugget of hash in his pocket and did about 3 years for it!<br /><br />On a lighter note, welcome back Studio and enjoy the few lines of PDS!&nbsp; :)

With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it&#039;s the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world... <br /><br />there are many others i left off the list that are pretty tight on security: <br />Panama<br />Nicaragua<br />Miami International Airport (coming into Miami from Columbia, your funneled in to a completely separate lane of customs that only handles those people coming from Columbia....) yeah because they think 99% of everyone is smuggling kilo&#039;s of cocaine on them..

That&#039;s the problem, it wasn&#039;t PDS :(. I&#039;ve slowly been working my way through my PDS and thought I was all out of coke.

I just wish I knew who I bought it from so that I know not to make the same mistake twice.

Its sooo good)<br />Hope you are all having some fun rails. <br />Just wanted to share my appreciation for advice given in this thread. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138473.msg1222247#msg1222247">Quote from: beastpiss77 on June 11, 2013, 04:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have to work tomorrow, but here I am doing some lines and eating leftover Thai food. Am I the only one who does some blow and then eats afterward? Is that weird? It&#039;s not that it makes me hungry, it&#039;s that I was already hungry beforehand. I can also do a few lines and then go to bed shortly thereafter, without any other pharmaceutical intervention, except maybe booze.<br /><br />As a chronic over-sharer, I often find myself wishing I could post my random coke-related musings on Facebook. But I guess this is the next best thing, so here are a couple status updates...<br /><br />I always make sure to put my coke-piled mirror out of the reach of my cat&#039;s wandering tail. He&#039;s always knocking over the vaporizer whip, which is annoying enough, but what a disaster it would be if he swept all my blow off the coffee table! One of these days I&#039;m gonna forget...<br /><br />Thank the gods for that Simply Saline nasal mist. Not only is it good for keeping things moist in there, but after a night of snorting shit that accumulates in my abundant forest of nose hair, a couple squirts of saline up each nostril is like doing a big extra bump. It washes all the trapped coke up to where it should be, and I&#039;m high all over again! Brilliant!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br />beastpiss77<br />Since adopting a saline nose spray method, my shnoggin is loving it.&nbsp; Reduced irritation and absolutely no blood spots, even after a heavy night on it. I&#039;m finding myself spraying like 6 times between rails and lots more at the end of the evening. Now I can abuse my body to a greater degree than before. :)<br /><br />also.....<br /><br />I suffer hay-fever from time to time which is a real impediment to my coke habit.<br />(refer to post “Bruce&#039;s Plugging Odyssey”)<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=138473.msg1118551#msg1118551<br /><br />So I have got onto a hay-fever nose spray. Even though I am not suffering at the moment, I tried using the spray before a big session and it was amazing. Whatever is in that spray that stops pollen from itching me, also stopped my nose from reacting to the coke. <br /><br />Give it a go!<br /><br />

				Really fucked up on a gram of some good coke I just finished off. Best shit I&#039;ve gotten on the street in awhile and the shit was only $80 for a gram. Shit looks like it came right off the brick. Ran a test kit on it, cocaine was the only substance that came up on the regnant test, which I found odd and wonder if my buddy hit the jackpot on a local cola connect. If you&#039;ve never tried street coke get out there and try some its getting better in my area and cheaper. Could be my town but I doubt it I don&#039;t live in a big town. Anyways my review of this bomb ass coke is over and I&#039;ll come back with a sober review. Also how much do you need to test? I got a little shake left and was thinking about washing it to see how pure it really is.<br /><br />I apologize in advance if none of this makes sense or is hard to understand I haven&#039;t done coke in awhile and its taken me for a ride still and I&#039;m suppose to be asleep for work later tonight haha.

Those are definitely the way to go. They are 10 times faster to use and 5 times more discreet than the traditional way(those are scientifically accurate numbers :D). Just turn the know and take a wiff, put it back in your pocket and no one is the wiser. The first time I saw one was in Scarface at the beginning when the the two dudes in the care ask Tony if he wants to meet up with some Columbians ;)

Those are definitely the way to go. They are 10 times faster to use and 5 times more discreet than the traditional way(those are scientifically accurate numbers :D). Just turn the know and take a wiff, put it back in your pocket and no one is the wiser. The first time I saw one was in Scarface at the beginning when the the two dudes in the care ask Tony if he wants to meet up with some Columbians ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />yeah, &quot;bullets&quot; are certainly the way to go if you are heading out to the bar or club and want to bring some cocaine along with you, its quick and easy to load, and it gives you about a 50mg bump (rather small) but if your like me you need prob 3-4 hits before your feeling it, ya know ? plus they are much easier than trying to pull a plastic baggie out of your pocket and scoop up some cocaine with a pen cap or your finger nail (IMHO) cause its late at night, your buzzed on alcohol and coke you can tear a baggie and dump the whole bag of coke in the toilet (trust me, ive had this happen to me before) <br /><br />but the ones they used in the movie scarface at the beginning you cant find cause they arent made anymore... <br /><br />if you go to your local head shop you cant say the word &quot;bullet&quot; you have to use the word &quot;snuff jar&quot; --- saying the word &quot;bullet&quot; is like walking into a head store and saying &quot;uh yeah, cant i get that bong on the top shelf&quot; --- 99% of the time they throw you out b/c of local laws -- you cant say certain words.. <br /><br />but me personally i use a &quot;Clear glass snuff vial w/ black spoon top&quot; those to me are better than the bullets cause i can load up that spoon with huge amounts of coke and sniff 8) 8) 8)

				I think Oprah should be tasered.<br /><br />I think it would be good for her and society and then we create a good book describing the experience and how everybody felt about Oprah getting tasered and the ethics of the act and the ethics of the recording and repeated playback of the event.<br /><br />I think that shit would be funny as all Hell.<br /><br />That rich bitch thinks the God damned world OWES her.<br /><br />Thank you Oprah, you are correct.<br /><br />I owe you one tasering!<br /><br />I just REALLY want to get it on HDMI......<br /><br />Oprah goes over to Switzerland and expects those extremely rich European Whities to kow-tow just like her American Whities.&nbsp; Those Swiss are the banks that financed Hitler and no one has gotten Jews&#039; money back yet.......&nbsp; <br /><br />But Oprah wants their respect.&nbsp; <br /><br />What if the bag that was &quot;too expensive&quot; for Oprah to purchase was filled with dead, human, gold teeth?<br /><br />What if the salesperson actually did Oprah a tremendous favor?<br /><br />Let&#039;s be honest, how many of you WANT TO SEE the store video of Oprah getting pissed?<br /><br />I wish that Swiss bitch had just tasered Oprah..... got it on store video tape..... and then released it on Al Jezeera news....<br /><br /><br />That&#039;s what I wish.<br /><br />Rich cunt.

				Well thats one way to get it safely over the border, ha ha. It delivers crazy energy.

				I have two fat rocks of some very beautiful pure white cocaine I&#039;ve acquired from HollyMolly here with me. Trying so desperately hard to save it for use in a couple weeks but it is ever so hard. Whiskey on the rocks and some lines of delicious fishscale, damn...<br />I do have about 4g of other cocaine but the quality just doesn&#039;t compare, it&#039;s ever so speedy. <br />Think I&#039;ve become a cocaine snob since using SR, I now pretty much refuse cocaine unless it&#039;s pure lol. <br /><br />Really want to try studio&#039;s PDS everyone is bangin about, I wonder if it compares with hollymolly&#039;s cocaine.. By the look of all the glowing reviews it certainly does. Anyone tried both and able to compare? If not, anybody able to compare PDS to Koltbiz&#039;s purified cocaine? <br />That was also some very nice cocaine..

				Bought from CloudSurfer and it blew me away!&nbsp; :) A pro.!<br /><br />I have the same tolerance with MDMA, I don&#039;t do it two nights in a row anymore because I find I&#039;m chasing the night befores great feeling and don&#039;t get it so feel it&#039;s a waste.<br /><br />Since finding the Road I do a lot more coke with a few weeks break from it now and then but the odd time, if it&#039;s near me, I&#039;ll do 3 - 4 evenings of it which is when the tolerance is high and by the 4th night, even the 3rd, I feel it&#039;s wasted on me or just not enjoyed as much as it should be!<br /><br />Have my eye on HollyMolly all the time for their MDMA. Hopefully they stay around!!! <br />&nbsp;

				Ha coke is a special for me.. usually once every 2 weeks or so with the mates. We don&#039;t go out and use it anymore since one of us almost got caught snorting in a club. We only use MDMA/E when we go out now. I find coke is best to stay in with anyway with a few drinks :)<br /><br />How much coke do you go through on your average night then? Oh, I haven&#039;t had HM&#039;s MDMA heard good things about it though!

				I&#039;m the same with coke myself, I&#039;d rather be with mates in a gaff or on my own which is the opposite of the way coke should make you feel but I like the comfort of not having to be in and out of a toilet and mostly I find it unsociable to be honest!<br /><br />If the coke is strong and I was on my own, for example, I did .3 of Bungee&#039;s recently and it took me the whole night to get through it and that included a few lines to a mate. A couple of weeks before that I did .25 of the same stuff a lot quicker! I try to keep my stash where I can&#039;t access it and try to take out .25 for the night. The plan half works!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Ha, ha, how are we all doing on this fine Tuesday (I think ??? ) my finest droogie friends&nbsp; ;D ?<br /><br />Studio, MurderF, HitTR, gtg, and everyone jnem, Bruce, did I mention everybody?<br />I&#039;ve been quiet lately trying to give my nose (and wallet) a well deserved holiday but it just doesn&#039;t work...<br /><br />And then I found a lovely surprise yesterday at my drop I honestly wasn&#039;t expecting (well not as soon)...<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I was surprisingly lucky enough to be selected by HollyMolly to receive a 1 gram sample of their new Colombian coke. As mentioned by everyone else, their stealth is a work of art. I don&#039;t know how they have the time to package orders. I think in total there EIGHT layers from the outside of the packaging to where the coke was hidden buried deep inside. From the outside, it looks like a perfectly legitimate online purchase which millions of people make every day. The coke itself is bright white flaky soft chunks. It was mainly 3 chunks and some loose flakes in the bag due to it being crushed slightly by the vacuum seal but clearly off the brick and not cut or re-rocked. I&#039;ve now had maybe 3 or 4 small bumps since yesterday and it&#039;s sooo smooth. You don&#039;t feel a thing when it goes up the nose and the onset and comedown are just as smooth. Although I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the strongest coke I&#039;ve had, it&#039;s still stronger than a lot on the Road and my estimate (completely unscientific for that it&#039;s worth!) is that it&#039;s around mid-80%. I know they only deal in bulk orders but I think anyone already considering purchasing one of HM&#039;s listings would be pleasantly suprised.<br /><br />Oh, and not that I am complaining but I think HM really needs to recalibrate their scales before they put themselves out of business; the 1 gram sample weighed over 1.3 grams&nbsp; ;) ! <br /><br />And, in the interest of trying to help you guys as much as possible (not because I want to&nbsp; ;) ) I&#039;m working through it as I typing here to get you guys a more thorough review...

As I mentioned in an earlier thread, using a hay-fever nose spray before your first line, and then lots of saline nose spray after does wonders. Not sure if supressing your bodies natural alergic reaction to toxic chemicals is sensible, but then again, is doing drugs sensible?<br /><br />Hey everyone. wishing you all a great, powdery weekend.<br />I myself am nicely stocked but....... no plans&nbsp; :-\<br />Do I have your permission to do rails at home, on my own, for no particular reason?

				Do the saline packets cause anyone else&#039;s nose to get majorly stuffed up, to the point of uncomfortable pressure, shortly after using them?<br /><br />I noticed the saline spray bottles only have sodium chloride, but the netty pot packets have sodium chloride &amp; sodium bicarbonate.&nbsp; With the bottles it does not happen but they&#039;re bloody expensive compared to netty pot packets.&nbsp; I know it&#039;s important to use sterilized stuff unless you want the brain eating amoebas... can I just boil up some salt water and keep it in a jug in the fridge?

				Jeez, hail the Neti Pot!<br /><br />Didn&#039;t take any of my Silk Road quality coke from it&#039;s hiding place as wanted a quite night but was given some local coke to try. Looked good and chopped well like some good stuff I&#039;ve bought from the road but it feels like I have a ball of gasoline stuck up the top of my snout burning away!<br /><br />Can&#039;t wait to wash it out but the funny thing is, I keep going back for more even though it&#039;s not great stuff, doh!&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Makes me look forward to my next proper SR coke session more now! <br /><br />Hope y&#039;all starting the weekend well hootin&#039; away!!!&nbsp; :)

				<br />well,<br />actually.. ;)<br />the scientist that first isolated the active alkaloid within the coca leaf during the 18th century fought nail and tooth to convince the scientific community of it&#039;s awesome properties, only to be scoffed at.. until again, in front of everyone important, he took a vial of liquid cocaine, flooded his eye, and proceeded to stick a fairly large needle into his eye and remove it with no discomfort!! and wham bam.. cocaine was born!!

				@Big O - how was the burger? Did you get an order of Fat Lines for desert&nbsp; ;) ?<br /><br />@MF - How&#039;s it going? Sent you a PM!<br /><br />@Dan - Correct, it&#039;s not really an &#039;out at a party&#039; thing but when partying at home and looking for alternatives it&#039;s pretty cool; hence the reason for only doing a couple of times.

				Well sticking it up my butt hasn&#039;t done much for me!<br /><br />Having said that, I&#039;m not convinced there is actually that much C in the 5gr that I just bought anyway :(<br /><br />Generally speaking, as much as I can&#039;t stop doing the stuff, I never really get this euphoria that people talk of! I do love it dribbling down my throat though, but this stuff tastes and smells a bit funny and doesn&#039;t give that nice dribble :(<br /><br />It&#039;s missing that sharpness and almost smells like there&#039;s a slight spicy element to it. It&#039;s also much more fluffy and flour-like than I would expect. Hmmm.

				Studio you are THE fucking man and PDS IS THE FUCKING SHIT!<br /><br />Why? Last night I&#039;d had a break from coke for a few days and decided it was time for a line or two. Had some from another vendor with &#039;claimed&#039; ultra high purity percentages (supposedly higher than PDS!). I had a big bump, felt a little bit but not much, had another bigger bump, felt a little more and so on till I had just under 0.5g. By the end of it, I was tired and had a headache. I didn&#039;t even want to finish the small amount I had left! So I took some pain killers and went to bed. I just put it down to tolerance.<br /><br />Tonight, I had a very small bump of PDS and felt amazing euphoria within minutes! Had another very bump or 3 and I&#039;m mashed! I&#039;ve probably gone thought less than half the amount of PDS and have way more pleasure, suppressed appetite, euphoria etc. etc.<br /><br />So, it wasn&#039;t tolerance which fucked it all up last night, it was shit coke!<br /><br />I know everyone keeps banging on about PDS but it is seriously THE BEST COKE I&#039;ve bought off SR, if not the best coke I&#039;ve have had (and definitely the best I&#039;ve from the USA).<br /><br />I think Studio charges $148 (maybe?) per gram but it&#039;s a lot more pleasurable and lasts 2/3 times longer than coke from a lot if other vendors so you can&#039;t just compare price per gram between vendors. If a $100 gram from another vendor lasts one night but the $148 gram of PDS lasts 2 nights how is the other vendor any cheaper???<br /><br />And on top of all that, he&#039;s a fucking fantastic trustworthy guy to speak to and deal with!<br /><br />Blah, blah, chop, sniff, blah... Hmm, maybe just one more bump...

				so whose got a gram of PDS they will part with?&nbsp; Am I the black sheep? So 5&nbsp; oclock done came and gone hey studio54&nbsp; did I miss out on your coke? <br /><br />But seriously it&#039;s a testament to studio&#039;s coke just to watch what happens after he makes that announcement. Just look at all the coke heads gather up and try to be first in the line so they don&#039;t miss out on studio&#039;s coke. I&#039;m definitely in there but alls well that ends well and well I guess I&#039;m about to give up on it seeing as how that is the way the path is leading me.<br /><br />It&#039;s been a lot of fun and I&#039;ll be checking your page studio and I feel lucky that I was able to get in on it a couple times before.

In a twisted kind of way, I&#039;m so glad I wasted money on other coke otherwise I wouldn&#039;t have appreciated PDS for what it is. I like to alternate between the different supplies I have from different sources and it never ceases to amaze me how good PDS is. If it was the only coke I had, I would probably have forgotten how great it really is. <br /><br />All I&#039;ll say is DO NOT STOP SELLING PDS!!!!!! <br /><br />And if you need a nice safe place to stash a few bricks safely, let me know and I&#039;d gladly keep nice tight hold of them for ya&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D .

The MDMA/MDA capsules I made were maybe a small bit too strong at between 190mg-200mg with a splash of MDA but holy moly they were nice!!!&nbsp; :) Bliss with a bump of ket on the comedown which I&#039;m not used to but done in small doses is a perfect comedown tool after MDMA&nbsp; ;) A bit of sleep and beer and coke for the rest of the day. All in all I partied for 5 nights which is a lot, two of which were quite and that&#039;s why I&#039;m takin a break.<br /><br />Hope y&#039;all havin&#039; a good start to the weekend, enjoy folks!<br /><br />

				underestimating your HQ coke :(<br /><br />was going great.

Read the customs declaration, more confused. Opened it up, dug through some stealth and found a MBB. Had no knife so took ages to get it open, finally got it ripped apart and found another MBB&nbsp; &gt;:( . Arghhhh!!!! F&#039;ing MBB&#039;s&nbsp; :P ! WTF! Finally, got in and found a vacuum sealed bag of rather tasty looking (and smelling&nbsp; :) ) M-39 weed from Bang4Bucks I&#039;d completely forgotten about! Yeah, can&#039;t wait&nbsp; ;D .....

				It sounds like everyone is keeping things on the literal (8)ball and that makes me a happy camper. I hope to again share with you my nose findings so as to better help everyone make an informed decision or just completely write me off and not bother to listen. I am fine with whatever choice you make as long you hurry up and make a choice so we can all sit here like the brothers in arms that we are and rail what should be glorious times.

I stopped at a house to ask for directions and got back into my car and did a big line before heading off again with the woman of the house looking out through the curtains!!! Ha Ha&nbsp; :) And that&#039;s only a small part of the journey! He He&nbsp; :) <br />I suffer badly with my sinuses when doing coke no matter how clean it is reported as being! It&#039;s a curse!!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Damn noses! As I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware there are other places you can stick coke with extremely good results&nbsp; ;) . I&#039;ve only ever done it twice but the effects were pretty amazing&nbsp; 8) . I&#039;m sure you get the idea :-X ...<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Dare I ask? I&#039;m fine with plugging (but for cocaine?). I&#039;ll never touch a vein though, and I&#039;d rather not get into smoking it since I&#039;d be freebasing before I knew it - I&#039;m a sucker for addiction but I value pulling my weight in the real world.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes, I was referring to plugging, not the most pleasant thing to do but it&#039;s worth it as the effects are pretty damn good!<br />I&#039;ve never injected anything and I don&#039;t plan on ever doing so...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />@chopper..<br /><br />We got the new batch in stock! As promise we offer you the free sample.<br />check listing for the new picture that we have upload.<br /><br />And pm us on the market your details..<br /><br />~HM<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hey HM - I will, THANK YOU&nbsp; ;D !!<br />Guys, look out for a comparison with HM&#039;s new batch. I&#039;ll update you all when it arrives.

				Just a tidbit of thought for the reviewers out there. I know I like to write reviews while on the product being tested but I think as a group or as a reviewer we should put a disclaimer that we are writing while high. I know there a lot of a good testers out there that give great in depth reports and after reports which I think should be done as to give the potential buyer more of an idea of the product.

				It goes like this, phunky went on and bought 6 grams after obviously buying from Studio before.<br /><br />It was an elaborate scam, hence the 6 grams that were ordered and happily fucking consumed.<br /><br />Now he&#039;s trying to save face, so he will be able to buy from other vendors. I hope Studio hits the round table and has you black balled from all cola vendors.<br /><br />Like i said before, and i&#039;ll say it again, your a bum thieving scum bag....and may your gonads rot.<br /><br />

				Quite again up in here 2nite LNTS folk!!!<br /><br />5AM for me and really should go to bed but had some visitors drinking my drink and snorting the lines I chopped so a bit delayed.<br /><br />Without sounding mean, I shared about half a gram with them and told them all was gone to get rid of them so I could peacefully pull out my secret hidden half gram to enjoy a fat juicy white line on my own while bullshitting away online here on SR!<br /><br />Anyone else up enjoying a sneaky line or two or three or four at the mo.? If so, enjoy and enjoy the rest of the night because oul HTR is gonna hit the hay sensibly because of tiredness due to over excertion of enjoyment brought on by copious amounts of hootin&#039; and a&#039; tootin&#039; this evening washed down with pints of local brew!!!<br /><br />

				Hi guys/gals hope your weekends were all awesome.<br />I opted for a &quot;clean&quot; weekend just a few beers. Why? Because I am still holding on to an outstanding little baggy of outstanding PDS.... yes I have self control after all, and I want my tolerance right down before I shnoozle it all down. Got an event next weekend and its a bit of a giveaway when you are the only one not totally blown away.&nbsp; Strange logic I know, but it works for me.<br />aw....<br />hell....<br /><br />SHNOOZLE.....<br /><br />damn.<br />(please disregard my previous comment about self-control)

				@ CallmeBruce,<br /><br />Have to agree with holding off for tolerance and enjoyment reasons!<br /><br />For me, I feel I&#039;m wasting good coke if I do it a few nights in a row because I just don&#039;t feel I get the same buzz as the first night. If only I could control my self control I&#039;d be laughing!!!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Enjoyed two nights of it over the w&#039;end and another package arrived today which I had to try but can&#039;t judge it well due to tolerance but I&#039;m sure it will be nicer once I take a small break!<br /><br />Anyway, outside of that, weather was good and had a nice weekend! Hope all you fellow LNTS folk had a good one too!!!&nbsp; :)

				So I was curious as to what you listeners like to do as preventive measures (if any) while doing your snow white. This could be anything from taking a multi-vitamin to having a nasal wash. I&#039;d like to hear what the others like to do to take caution and enjoy themselves without harm. If you have any science or pseudo-science might as well throw that in as well, I&#039;m all ears.<br /><br />Myself, I take multi-vitamins with a few other supplements daily so I don&#039;t have any ones that I specifically take to help out but I feel that this eases the wear and tear on the body. I also have a nasal wash, or a bottle you fill with water the solution and spray up your nose. It&#039;s great for cleaning out your nose during/after a night but once your nose is clogged isn&#039;t that much of a help.<br /><br /><br />Thoughts/ideas/suggestions. Let&#039;s get discussing.

				I use multi vitamins on a coke night too, Solgar VM-75 I think. A good brand!<br /><br />I lately started using a neti-pot with boiled water that&#039;s cooled down until slightly warm with Himalayan neti-pot salt and find it does a better job than a spray as it gets right in and through your nasal system to clear it out before bed after coking it up.<br /><br />A swim in the sea is great for me too and that really clears your nasal system out properly!!!<br /><br />I always have had a healthy diet and after a coke binge I&#039;ll take that even more seriously and drill myself full of goodness. <br /><br />As I get a bit older I think it is very important to look after myself with my lifestyle without sounding like a nerdy health freak!!!

				I dont do vitamins....but its just self induced breaks and eating well, also living so fucking far away like i do, i dont or rather dont have the temptation like you guys have over there...because we dont have a quality coke supply over here, too many people just jump on everything, and its just not worth it.<br /><br />If i could get good cola domestically, then it would be different i&#039;m sure.<br /><br />But with cocaine...i have to be careful...it really has its time and place for me. : )<br /><br />Does anyone have the tendency to be a little fussy on cocaine?<br /><br />People who walk slow or procrastinate can really make it feel as though TIME is standing still for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whilst driving, if i&#039;m high, and someone drives like an idiot, all over the road, i&#039;m like-&quot;What fucking drugs are you on....damn.&quot;<br /><br />I was out a couple of weeks ago, surrounded by people, and there was this one guy, staring at everyone, he couldn&#039;t sit still, kept craning that fucking neck of his...he was leering at the girls, and then i caught him looking at me when i was looking at something else....i said to myself-&quot;I bet that fucker is staring at me, sure enough, his eyes were locked on....unbelievable....so, i spoke up and drilled this mother fucker....<br /><br />&quot;Hey....&quot; I said. <br /><br />He turns around, and looks at me, he said &#039;Excuse me?&quot;<br /><br />I said-&quot;Would you like my camera?&quot;<br /><br />He just stares at me.....i said again-&quot;Would you like my camera?&quot; <br /><br />Everyone is staring now....<br /><br />Still he just stares....<br /><br />&quot;Well here, i pull my camera out...&quot;Now how about you take that, take some pictures of everyone here, and then you can stop twisting and turning in your seat without having the need to stare at everyone?&quot; <br /><br />This guy turned round, head down and didn&#039;t fucking move or stare at anyone from then on. <br /><br />I love my cola. : ))<br />

				A good system that works for me is to delete TOR and put your local connection #&#039;s away somewhere. You have to make the conscious decision to WANT to be away from SR and buying in general.

I tend to just change one addiction to the next, that doesn&#039;t have to be one drug to another. It can be anything that eats up time and becomes a habit you can get into. After that you start to want that hobby/habit like it was coke and it makes you happy to finish a book or paint a model train/plane. Really whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />Cocaine is an amazing drug but it&#039;s something we all need to respect and take with pride.

It&#039;s never something you should be consumed by. If you can&#039;t hold off on doing it then it&#039;s time to put it down for a bit. If you can be one of the few who can take a bump like they do a morning coffee and be done with it for the day I highly commend you. But it&#039;s not something everyone is capable of.

I try to keep well hydrated throughout the process and to keep track of how much alcohol I consume throughout the evening. As you know the “lady dressed in white” can negate the effects of alcohol so you can really damage yourself there. A shower before bed to really rinse it out and vitamins in the morning.

				Quality is hit and miss, you just never know when dealing with some of the new vendors on here. Rails provides consistent results though.<br /><br />I just know the time I had Kolbitz there was no smell and it went of the nose so easy, I then went on to type out a rant about who knows what on here and it wasn&#039;t even 8:30am.

				I&#039;m a big fan of yayspray. I tend to take a lot of drugs up my nose, so occasionally I&#039;ll make the water soluble stuff into a spray with a bit of purified water, a drop of high proof vodka and a gram or so of whatever I&#039;m using. I do this with both cocaine and ketamine and sometimes the two together. It works especially well with high quality coke and a good mister-type nasal spray bottle. Basically like doing a bump. You can also snort whatever liquid is left at the bottom of the bottle when you&#039;re done.<br /><br />Another plus is that if you make it with very cut coke, a lot of the cuts wont dissolve, so you&#039;ll be getting a cleaner experience anyway.

				Hey cool thread idea, MB. I&#039;m not a regular orderer from SR, but I should be. The blow around these parts is absolute garbage. I do remember MB from when I made my first couple of purchases, from the Teflon Don thread. I was one of the lucky ones I guess, I grabbed a gram off of him and he sent it, but then I had some extra coins left because the price skyrocketed since I bought and I ended up buying a half gram from him and it never arrived. The guy was a great con though, i messaged him a few times before i bought and he seemed like a really cool guy. It really surprised the hell out of me that he ended up scamming people. His coke was OK too, but nothing I would consider super great. It was better than most around here so it was a good treat. The gram last me and my wife from like 15 hours, but it sketched me out, kind of speedy shit. <br /><br />So I am making another purchase this week and right now I am leaning towards rails. I want to get the best coke I have ever seen. I have been doing blow, mostly cooking up crack, for a long time, like 20 years or so. I considered it a problem for a number of those year like scraping up ever cent I could to get my next &quot;hit&quot;. Anyway I have outgrown that thankfully. Now I want to do it from time to time, but when I do it I want to do it right. I could spend 250 bucks here and get an 8 ball that is something like 20-25% pure which is absolute bullshit, that&#039;s like paying 750 for 75% pure shit.<br /><br />I like the road a lot, but damn it feels like a gamble to me now, especially since I got burned once by TD. Every dealer always says they got the best shit. So right now it&#039;s a toss up between Rails, and LexQ. There was another vendor named MeGrimlock or something like that, but I see his listings are down. Makes me wonder if he&#039;s a scammer. I have seen LexQ around for a long time so he seems legit, but I have read a lot of good things about rails. So I don&#039;t know what to do.<br /><br />Anyway, just did a little puff of garbage and in the chatting mood, thought I would introduce myself. If anyone can help me make the decision of who to buy from, please do so. I am getting something in the next few days.

				Yah TeflonDon got me as well, it happens. You just need to brush off the dirt and educate others. But onto your question.<br /><br />These three vendors in no particular order (domestic Canada)<br /><br />Whiteyford<br />Rails<br />LexQ<br /><br />Have been around a while, have proven themselves worthy by selling quality product and not displaying scamming principles. The choice is yours as to who to pick. I do know WhiteyFord is out of product for the moment and LexQ is backlogged with orders.<br /><br />So your best bet is Rails. Go into this transaction with the thought of buying quality cocaine that is better than average. DO NOT go into this transaction expecting to be given a blowjob and a sandwich after (don&#039;t worry, it could happen) it&#039;s with high expectations that I find most buyers become disappointed with the hype. Just keep the excitement under control until you try it and you&#039;ll see for yourself what you are working with.<br /><br /><br />I also recommend trying more than one vendor out and finding out which style of cocaine (everyone likes something different) you enjoy best. The road is your oyster. Now go explore and let us know what you find.

I am super excited. As I said I am a long time crackhead. When I started 20 years ago(I&#039; rocked it exclusively for the first 10 years or so) it all tasted like candy. Something happened though, the taste changed, the effect changed. I started getting paranoid when doing it, super paranoid. I want to blame it on new people supplying my town cutting it with active cuts, and I am hoping that the paranoia is caused by the cuts as well. I have a feeling that no matter how pure the cocaine is I will get paranoid from it. What I do to control it lately is do small blasts. My normal blast, or shot, is .2 of a gram. **Now I will get 2 or 3 out of that. I don&#039;t get ringers anymore. Just super paranoia. The bigger the blast the more paranoid I get and it sucks big time. So I am putting good stuff on a pedestal, hoping I can feel a ringer again and no paranoia, or at least not until I&#039;m sketched from doing it all night. With the little blasts I am doing of the crap I get, I think something without active cuts will get me going good. <br /><br />I am waiting on a cheque to come in and for rails to put listings back up and I will report when I pick up. I have a feeling it won&#039;t be in my mailbox before the first.

I am super excited. As I said I am a long time crackhead. When I started 20 years ago(I&#039; rocked it exclusively for the first 10 years or so) it all tasted like candy. Something happened though, the taste changed, the effect changed. I started getting paranoid when doing it, super paranoid. I want to blame it on new people supplying my town cutting it with active cuts, and I am hoping that the paranoia is caused by the cuts as well. I have a feeling that no matter how pure the cocaine is I will get paranoid from it. What I do to control it lately is do small blasts. My normal blast, or shot, is .2 of a gram. **Now I will get 2 or 3 out of that. I don&#039;t get ringers anymore. Just super paranoia. The bigger the blast the more paranoid I get and it sucks big time. So I am putting good stuff on a pedestal, hoping I can feel a ringer again and no paranoia, or at least not until I&#039;m sketched from doing it all night. With the little blasts I am doing of the crap I get, I think something without active cuts will get me going good. <br /><br />I am waiting on a cheque to come in and for rails to put listings back up and I will report when I pick up.

I could not justify spending so much money to crawl out of my skin like I did. The shit just was not doing it for me any more. The taste was bad, the buzz was bad and it took everything I owned. So I stopped and didn&#039;t touch blow for around 4 years. I took my first puff again in April of 2012. The stuff was worse than I remembered. The taste was not there(the taste of crack is one of the most addictive parts of it for me). Instead of being the nice sweet candy taste, it was sour. I didn&#039;t get a huge rush and the paranoia came back. I&#039;m don&#039;t get near as paranoid as I used to, and I can kind of control it sometimes. When I just do little puffs then it&#039;s a lot easier to manage. Honestly after I try from a few more vendors from here I will probably quit. I do enjoy it again now because I can control the paranoia a bit, but it&#039;s not worth the money for me. I&#039;m really hoping that I will get more euphoria with a more pure product. Blow around these parts is cut to shit, to the point that I would bet that it is under 20%, maybe even under 10%. I remember talking to folks around here who bought in bigger quantities and they used to brag about &quot;the california comeback cut&quot;. I was given a few grams of cut before and I tried rocking it up. A gram of cut would come back to almost a gram of rock. It wasn&#039;t as hard as rocked blow, but when mixed with blow, it came back almost 100% and hard. I smoked the rocked up cut and that is where the taste and the speediness comes from. It had all the negative effects I have noticed since the change in blow years ago. I really hope that some purer blow that doesn&#039;t have active cuts in it will do it for me.<br />[/quote]

Just about everyone who smokes it likes it too much., I want to get a few grams and have it last me a few nights, but I know me and it will be gone the same day I get it, unless I hide it some place I don&#039;t have easy access to. That is my plan anyway. There&#039;s nothing like the first and second puffs of the day, after that you&#039;re just chasing the buzz. That&#039;s when it&#039;s time to put it away, but it gives me(and a lot of other people) a very intense feeling of &quot;I want another one&quot;. I usually rationalize and say &quot;I&#039;ll just do one more&quot;, but I will say that 10 or 15 times until it&#039;s all gone.<br /><br />Damn I can&#039;t wait till i get something good. I am giving up on local guys, everything I do will be from SR from now on. It just sucks that my income is temporarily fixed. I get a government cheque once a month because they are sponsoring me to go to school to upgrade my skills.I have until June then I should be back in the money. It will be a welcome relief after 2 years of a really low income.

It&#039;s a bit more alkaloid and kind of &quot;earthy&quot; smelling (to me anyway) But this is a good thing in my opinion and past use. It&#039;s Class A and it was produced in SA the correct way, no corners were cut and that&#039;s why I believe it smells as such and is so insanely high in % w/o any active cuts or adulterants. I love it! Rails and Studio are by far the best on the Road.

				Did you guys see the new shit digibuzz has up? Damn it looks sweet - he claims 90% purity, but I don&#039;t know how accurate it is. It looks almost like it&#039;s hard crystals, definitely looks yummy. Too bad I ordered the &quot;HQ&quot; stuff from him before he had this pure up.<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/a94b8eac55

The blow situation in my area well, blows. Shit is so cut and they cut it with stuff that will come back when you cook it so when you cook a gram and get a gram rock out of it then they say &quot;see how pure it is&quot;. Too bad the rock doesn&#039;t give you a buzz, tastes like shit&nbsp; and leaves you sketchy as fuck.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got to just rely on the road for my shit and actually enjoy what I spend my hard earned cash on. I can accept the tolerance breaks, when you got good blow then it just makes it that much better when you do get to do it.

				So the seizure notice on the landing page of SR is a little disconcerting, though I am comforted a bit by the fact there is a SR logo as a watermark on it. This tweet by a guardian reporter this morning is a little worrying too - https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/385423872188628992 &quot;DoJ say they have arrested the man alleged to be Silk Road founder &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; in San Fransisco yesterday.&quot;<br /><br />What is going on?
