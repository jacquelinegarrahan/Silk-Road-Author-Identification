				Thought some of you out there would have some fabulous Conundrum&#039;s that you could share with us. :) There are loads of members using this forum absolutely off their nut, which I thought may add some&nbsp; humour to any solutions offered. So dig deep and lets see if we, as a community, can produce some answers to questions which have bewildered the human race for a long time.<br /><br />I&#039;ll kick it off with a couple that I&#039;m hoping can be answered.<br /><br />Most of you would know what a Lady Bug is,&nbsp; a beautiful,&nbsp; circular,&nbsp; gentle little bug, reddish/orange in colour with black spots on it&#039;s wings, usually found in and around the garden.<br />The question is we all&nbsp; know of the beautiful Lady Bug, but is there also a Male Lady Bug or are they all female? If they are in fact all&nbsp; Lady Bugs, how do they reproduce and have baby Lady Bugs?<br /><br />Next one is simple. We all know what colour SNOW is. It&#039;s such a beautiful White which many people go skiing on, make Snowmen out of it, have Snow Ball fights and sometimes get the chance to experience a White Christmas, lucky buggars. <br />The question is where does the White in the snow go when the ice melts? As far as I&#039;m aware, snow that has melted turns into water which can be used to drink, but the water is clear, not White. So where in the hell does it disappear to?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Why is it&nbsp; when you buy say $20.00 petrol, and you have gone over a touch to $20.02, when you go in to pay and you pay with cash, the cashier will round down your purchase to $20.00 even. However, if I put the exact same amount of petrol in and paid the cashier with my credit/debit card, I would be charged $20.02, not the $20.00 charged when using cash.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;m looking forward to reading some classics, especially from some of the more &quot;mature&quot; members here on the Forum. :) :)

				Why bother fucking your own mind up thinking about this kind of crap.<br /><br />Simply pay 150btc to a prominent forum member and vendor, then you can have a &quot;consultation&quot; and just get told the answers by he who know it all.<br /><br />Know what I&#039;m saying?
