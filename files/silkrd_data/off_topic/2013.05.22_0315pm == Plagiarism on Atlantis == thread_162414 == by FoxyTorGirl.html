				SR members, Friends, beware of vendors on Atlantis with similar names as on SR.<br /><br />I just found out that someone registered my account name on Atlantis and uploaded all the pictures and descriptions that I have on SR!!!<br /><br />So my guess is any other account there could also just be a copy, so deal with caution when on that site....<br /><br />Stay safe,<br />FoxyGirl~

				Even in BMR there&#039;s the same issue.<br /><br />Vendors (many times scams) trying to use the established vendors&#039; names here in SR to gather clients and possibly scam them.

				Yeah, be wary of Atlantis &quot;verified&quot; accounts too. Ask for a PGP signed message from the vendor.

				How can copycats or scammers get around the &quot;verified seller&quot; badge? According to ATL staff, an established vendor on SR has to PM the ATL support on SR to verify they&#039;re who they say they are. ATL staff must have a SR account to do this, but that&#039;s what it says on their site.

				People on these forums have doubts about ATL&#039;s security, I don&#039;t know where they get their information from though. Also, the main conspiracy is, that ATL could have been set up by LE in a major entrapment sting. I tried buying from Uglydoll, an SR vendor, verified on ATL. when SR was being attacked that last time. Uglydoll had my order processing for over a week, didn&#039;t reply to my PM&#039;s, so I got ATL staff to cancel it. I made sure that I used different passwords and pin to my details on SR.
