				Looking for tips from anyone with experience.&nbsp; I&#039;ve heard working in teams of 2 or more is good, where one person is the runner and the other person holds the drugs.&nbsp; What if you&#039;re only one person trying to sell? Etc.&nbsp; Thanks for the advice.

				Best trick I have came up with, put the drugs in your hand and put your phone over them, drop the drugs into the hand of the person who is buying while you drop the phone in there hand. Act as if they are looking at your phone (which happens a lot at loud clubs) and them have them hand the phone back. If you wanna make it even better have one person hold the drugs and do the drug exchange that I described and have another do the money exchange. Club security looks for money exhange the most. So if you have one person with the money and one with the drugs, the drug guy will be more stealthy because they will be only handing over a phone and will likely not get suspected. The money person probably will get caught a few times but all they have is money which then proves they are not distibuting :) Hope that helps!

				selling at clubs is just a big no-no imo, most security will be on the ball for this kind of shit nowadays my advice would be to sell to people BEFORE they get in the club or even after that&#039;s when the most money is made. I personally HATE it when lots of random people come up to me in a club asking me if I want to buy shit or asking me if I had any..<br />

				omg to what kind of clubs are you guys going to? xD<br />you definitely need to go more underground if you have to worry about that...<br /><br />I was in clubs where I prepared lines on a table in the chillout area... and the security guy was sitting right next to me!! lighting with his torch so could see better!!! =) (i offered him one but he said no...)<br /><br />if you&#039;re at a good rave the guests don&#039;t sell drugs there. the party-organisator offers them! acid-bowles and plates with md/2c pills or any other fancy stuff thats around at the moment... and everyone shares.<br /><br />LOVE PEACE UNITY ;)

				If you sell in clubs you&#039;ll get caught. No way around it, maybe you can do it for a bit, but you&#039;ll get busted. Someone will snitch on you.

				...yes agree with most comments so far, plus...if you don&#039;t know how the system works in and around clubs you had in mind = fucking dangerous, as you might find yourself beaten up by bouncers and / or find yourself in a holding cell for an evening.<br /><br />most cases:<br />the owner has a say in what gets sold in his club and is enforced by the doormen and bouncers.<br />the local lords in the area control the suburb / area and the club would full under the same rules.<br /><br />&nbsp;:o

				Just watch the bathrooms.&nbsp; If they are heavily policed by staff (one at a time only), then it&#039;s not worth the trouble.&nbsp; If they aren&#039;t staffed at all, there is your solution!

				SWIM bought some cids in a club once, it was the sketchiest exchange ever. This guy had to have been connected with the owner/bouncers because he was with atleast 2 other people selling that night.

				further advise when being a runner in clubs:-<br />- guard against moisture getting to your goods, the silica absorbing thingys would help but adds to the bulkiness of your stash....too many plastic bags increase threat of moisture.<br />- pre pack them into little bags to quickly dish out w/o getting your whole drug stash out, ie to do discreetly.<br />- probably advise moving it to a hidden pocket from its &quot;hidden&quot; location to get it into the club, be aware its now easily found on your person.<br />- use a thin strong material pouch with a drawstring perhaps, and a method to safety pin / tie with drawstring to a jacket or something...<br /><br />- avoid the toilets where everyone else seem to be dealing from, use some other methods like the cigarette box way as mentioned somewhere in this thread.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				Be careful with that, two bouncers took my friend who was dealing at a local club to a bathroom and beat the shit out of him for dealing there, it was his third time getting caught though.

				Agree with most of what&#039;s already been said, clubs are risky, you never know who&#039;s toes you might be treading on or where Larry Law is lurking, but if you have to it&#039;s best to have a man/woman on the inside, security or bar staff work best. Deal in bulk with them, and let them worry about pushing to the punters... You&#039;ll have to look after them with some gear or a cut of the $$ but it&#039;s worth the peace of mind.

				...been to clubs where they had an outside section under a gazebo, problem seems to be too much light despite been nightime and a bouncer always seemed to be nearby, perhaps it could work but dipping into your pocket and the exchange of cash is going to be difficult to cover up....let us know..?!<br /><br />

				Best idea is smoking areas in clubs. I always take a little extra with me on a night out, ask for a rizla or a light in the smoking area and ask if they want to buy. As long as you&#039;re discrete, there&#039;s no problem. I usually make enough to cover the cost of the night out. Try not to look like a drug dealer&nbsp; :D <br />Where I am, the drug dealers who get caught are a &#039;type&#039; and stick out like a sore thumb- don&#039;t wear cheap sports wear and spend the night in the club toilet.

				Bottom line, you need to do your homework.&nbsp; You can&#039;t stroll into a random club and expect to make bank on night one.&nbsp; They are all different and have their own policies.&nbsp; If you spend enough time there, you will get to know the regulars and figure it out on your own.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been to some where the only sellers are employees and some where it&#039;s all out in the open.<br /><br />Err on the side of caution in all cases and don&#039;t be in a hurry to move anything.

				Selling in cubs is very dangerous! Bar staff love drugs and love to catch people selling so they can just take there stuff for free (other option is they call the cops).&nbsp; But I did it very successfully for many years back in the early 90&#039;s.&nbsp; I used a team of three people one being me.&nbsp; One person would make the sale and take the cash always at the bar when ordering drinks so you had an excuse to have money out.&nbsp; The second person on the team then would catch the customer walking away from the bar and great them like an old friend shake hands and hug and pass the pills.&nbsp; The phone thing mentioned earlier would work great too in today&#039;s day and age when everyone has one.&nbsp; Now the third guy is the most important one of all hes your runner.&nbsp; the number one and two guys need to be carrying a very small amount of cash or product depending on which side they are working.&nbsp; Small enough that the product could be dropped into the drink number one is carrying or small enough that the amount of cash on number two would not indicate hes selling.&nbsp; Number three guy makes this happen by making cash drops and picking up new product, so hes in and out of the club a lot.&nbsp; best if hes a smoker and needs to step out for a cig.&nbsp; My guy wasn&#039;t and always used &quot;damm its smoky in there I need some fresh air&quot;.<br /><br />I actually got pulled from a club one night had 4 in my pocket and dropped them into my beer bottle, I walked to the back door with the bouncers and let them pat me down go through my pockets and wallet all while holding my beer.&nbsp; Needless to say I didnt drink that beer until very late in the night when we were about to leave to go to an after party which I was not going to be working then,&nbsp; And I split it between myself and a friend it was 4 hits!<br /><br />last tip NEVER and I mean NEVER use and sell at the same time in a club you will get sloppy and lose money and or product and more than likely be noticed by the staff.

				- its also the patrons &quot;outside&quot; ...around you, no flashing lights, not as dark as inside the club, some seating arrangements would help.....<br />- preparing each dosage helps instead of getting the whole thing out...<br />- there are specific methods i would use but not going to post....<br /><br />- some UK specific pub &amp; club info : I&#039;ve noticed more of those &#039;Swann&#039; type miniature cameras (same size as a web cam w/o the housing..), eg<br />&nbsp; http://www.partsguysusa.com/uploaded/images/Product%20images/SCU-Swann/SCUSW211DSC.jpg?e=1<br />&nbsp; http://ii.alatest.com/product/full/5/2/Swann-SW-P-MC3-Microcam-3-Wireless-Ultra-Miniature-Security-Camera-Swann-Microca-0.jpg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - sort of....more like the 2nd example<br />&nbsp; being discreetly installed in hallways, chillout rooms.......which i&#039;ve never been looking out for as i&#039;d normally expect the small dome shaped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;(current technology...still in use...http://www.sentry-resellers.com/cctv_cameras_mini_dome.htm )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or the very old outdoor type seen monitoring buildings these days.<br /><br />some goods points from wowzers, oldschoolclubkid &amp; Smcoop.....but<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8299.msg85561#msg85561">Quote from: oldschoolclubkid on January 20, 2012, 10:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">last tip NEVER and I mean NEVER use and sell at the same time in a club you will get sloppy and lose money and or product and more than likely be noticed by the staff.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>- done plenty of times, and if its a proper rave club it doesn&#039;t matter cos everyones at it ...haha, but yes you need to know your limits and having to focus when<br />&nbsp; necessary you can perfect it like me after a couple years....even been in situations with cop&#039;ers ....<br />&nbsp; only ever been in one situation where i had possibly lost the plot was when i was a buyer and couldn&#039;t count ..properly.....haha<br />&nbsp; not being able to read the pic off a pill is a common issue cos you&#039;re so high.....<br /><br /><br />be careful.<br />
