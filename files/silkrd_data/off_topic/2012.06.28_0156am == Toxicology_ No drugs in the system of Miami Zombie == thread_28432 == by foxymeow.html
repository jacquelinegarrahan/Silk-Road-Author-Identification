				Looks like everyone was attacking bath salts when they were not to blame or even the least bit involved. The idea that off the shelf low potency bath salts that are currently legal (considering MDPV is illegal) causing someone to become a cannibal is absolutely ridiculous. However, it really doesn&#039;t matter at this point because the media damage has been done. Bath Salts have been completely out of the news until this story and it caused the Synthetic Drugs ban to be added to the upcoming FDA Regulatory Bill which bans all for the 2cs which have never ever been in a problem in the United States and are considered a psychedelics with absolutely no addiction and incredibly low abuse potential. *Face Palm*

				This is the worst possible outcome for weed smokers, since you know there will be morons that will look at this as a clear cut case of the dangers of marijuana.

Pick up a magazine of treating yourself and you read stories like this all the time, minus the Jerry sandusky one. <br />But the politics and big wigs in America have there head so far up there ass that they don&#039;t care what the research proves. Not only research but the fact that so many have been on there death bed and they try medical marijuana for the last &quot;saving grace&quot; and it works! Not only works but has been proven that high CBD can put certain types of cancer into remission! Now what other substance does that? Kemo ya but all that radiation may kill cancer cells but what else is it doing? One can only imagine, so yea I can see how this is possibly going to hurt the medical marijuana community and the possible legalization in some states this November. Thanks Eugene, you fuck.

				One officer saying &quot;It was a new potent form of LSD called Bath Salts&quot; was enough to send the media into a frenzy. <br />The statement is just so completely unfounded and wrong on so many levels.&nbsp; All my workmates were talking about it one day (generally, more simple minded people than myself) and I really had to hammer it into their heads that it was a single sentence flying of the tongue of some obnoxious cop.&nbsp; I mean, the world believed this, and I was saying &quot;you know they don&#039;t actually know he was even on ANYTHING&quot;....but it was almost like talking to a brick wall.&nbsp; People like to have an opinion, despite lack of evidence.&nbsp; Everything with psychedelic potential must automatically be bad for society....

				Personally I think the bath salts story was hyperbole, used to gain mainstream attention for an outcry for bannings. Who doesn&#039;t like a zombie story? Interest spread on bath salts, and now states are banning substances? Coincidence? Fuck if I know. The fact that the zombie wasn&#039;t on MDVP and only had trace amounts of marijuana in his system has been around a few weeks. It&#039;s all hype. I read the leftist ass Huffington Post because it&#039;s somewhat tolerable but news is bullshit. Propaganda. Stuff like Fox News rots your brain.
