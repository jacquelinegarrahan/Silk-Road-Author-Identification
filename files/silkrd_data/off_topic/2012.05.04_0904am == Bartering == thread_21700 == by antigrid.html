				Title: <strong>Bartering</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				First off, this is my first post, so hello everyone. Looking forward to using this site. I have several questions but I think they should be kept in separate topics so I will start with my first. Is there a way to barter on SR? Since I am new and do not have 31 BTC to spend yet on a seller account, and not sure how I am going to get the initial 31 BTC besides spending $150+ and using an exchanger. I have adderall that I would like to trade, so is there a way where I can offer what I have, send it to the person who wants it (rather then have them send me BTC) and have them purchase what I want from someone else for me? I am assuming there probably isn&#039;t but figured I&#039;d ask. If not, any suggestions on getting my inital BTC so I can start building my reputation and making some BTC?

				This is the basis of an idea I been working on. Basically, buy a seller account, sell the things you got plenty of, spend coins at SR. It eliminates the danger of cashing out coins and the hassle of buying them as well.

				I havent been here all that long, but in my time on the forums i have seen people trade seller accounts for drugs before. Its just a matter of finding someone who is willing to: <br /><br />a)- trust you enough to actually come through with the goods.<br /><br />b)- is willing to break the rules set forth by silk road admin.<br /><br />Good luck&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />

				Many people will not be comfortable with anonymous drug bartering, and for good reason.&nbsp; The way things are on SR, the vendor can be held at least somewhat accountable for mistakes/scams, in the sense that his rating will be destroyed or he may never be welcome in the market again.&nbsp; Obviously this already has its flaws, so the likelihood that someone will mail drugs to your address in hopes that you&#039;ll mail some to theirs is pretty low, and that&#039;s assuming they&#039;re willing to give out their address in the first place.&nbsp; Would you just give your name and mailing address to the first person who wanted to trade with you?&nbsp; Avoiding security risks is one of the main reasons people are picky about who they buy from (rating, feedback, packaging, etc).

				It seems much more practical to use btc than to trade item for item.&nbsp; Look at it this way:&nbsp; &nbsp; If you use the barter system both the vendor and the buyer in the transaction must send their real world address to the person with whom they are bartering with.&nbsp; This strips away anonymity and would make it much easier to discover the true identities of the members of SR.

				You guys know I wasn&#039;t talking about trading like actual trading one for another, right? I did mean to use BTC for the exchange medium, just instead of cashing coins out, you spend them at SR as well. I was actually doing some reading yesterday and it has me wanting to use BTC whenever possible, just to support it as an alternate currency. Which is another reason to not cash them out, but keep them moving around our micro economy we have.&nbsp;

				This would only work if SR created a new user group to prevent the coins from being transferred to any other user or outside of silk road.<br /><br />I like the idea. It would give new sellers with the products or connections, but no cash, the ability to get started.<br /><br />But I think it would need to allow for 2 separate linked accounts to protect the identities of those involved.<br /><br />Then when they have paid off their seller account fees, the account &quot;opens up&quot; for regular unrestricted use.<br /><br />

				Getting back to the OP<br /><br />If you cant afford the seller account as the current 30ish BTC then TBH SR is not for you.<br /><br />Having read numerous threads on here, the general vibe is that a street dealer would would struggle to make much on SR, however a level or so above that, where you are already dealing in higher quantity, SR becomes a gold mine as you can effectively sell bulk at street prices.&nbsp; If you are at that level then 31 BTC is a drop in the ocean, if you are not then there are a lot of people saying that there really isnt that much to be made on SR.

Excellent thinking.<br /><br />V.
