				Well, the story starts like this. A couple months back, my brother was swindled into buying a business. He was shown fake gross/net profit charts by the previous owner. He is now dealing with increasing debt by the month. The previous owner and his family are now back in Europe, probably spending my brother&#039;s life savings away. <br /><br />I&#039;m sitting here wishing I were Liam Neeson, and that I had a very particular set of skills to make the previous owner&#039;s life a living hell. But I don&#039;t... What I do have is the motivation to perform unlawful tasks so my brother doesn&#039;t spend the next ten years digging himself out of a hole and having his family suffer because of it. He&#039;s about to file bankruptcy to cut his losses... I know he has the place and his inventory insured, and this is where you guys come in.<br /><br />What&#039;s the best possible strategy to make the conflagration look like an accident. A short circuit, or something of that nature? I will never be traced back to it, I already know to make sure of that. What chemicals should I use to start the fire that won&#039;t leave behind residue? In what places should I start the fire?

				1. Get a bunch of young punks to protest it! <br />2. get them wasted and provoke them<br />3. have them burn the shit down in a riot madness!<br />4.????????<br />5. Profit<br /><br />All jokes aside i&#039;m sorry to hear about your brother getting suckered into something like this. I know fire marshalls are very good at what they do so make sure you wanna do this 100% and do it correctly.<br /><br />I was talking to a worker at a local chinese take out and he had told me some his dads friends used to get give crack heads money and have them break in burn it and leave...

				It&#039;s in a wealthy township, unfortunately. There&#039;s a high lack of crackheads, so that option&#039;s out. I already have a friend willing to do execute the plan. Problem is I know his demeanor too well; if he gets caught, I get caught. It&#039;s as simple as that. :(<br /><br />I just need a plan to mask what actually takes place. It needs to seem purely accidental.

You misunderstand. You start the fire electrically and leave the chemicals (say cleaning ones, other industrial ones whatever) next to it so once the electrical fire gets going it hits the chemicals. Like stealthy firewood. You should start it in a storage area or something like that where these kind of things would be normally kept.

				Ya limitless is right just start a electrical fire the fire marshalls are very understanding when it comes to accidents but it does depend on where u live. And if its a restaraunt then it will be really easy to get away with it.

Much more effective when there is bulbs and stuff involved.

				What I would do and could be purely accidental is take a small two plate stove (they&#039;re cheap so don&#039;t worry about loosing it) fill a pot half way to three quarters with oil and put a few potato chips (to make it look like someone was cooking dinner) into the pot and leave the stove near curtains or something that will take flame when the oil in the pot eventually sets alight.<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Regards,<br />The Godfather

Who wants to be the one who admitted they made the chips? Fuck that. <br /><br />If you do it my way you can put it down to just to it being an old, damaged or badly built structure. Shit like that happens on a daily basis and it&#039;s much better when dealing with insurance companies. If you are going to be Mr Arsonist you have to play it clever because fire-investigators and insurance companies AREN&#039;T FUCKING STUPID and THEY DON&#039;T LIKE TO GIVE UP THEIR MONEY respectively. :)
