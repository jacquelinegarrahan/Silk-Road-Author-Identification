				No, I&#039;m not completely seriously considering doing this. Even if I did do it, I wouldn&#039;t use a real gun, I don&#039;t want to put anyone in any real danger. If anyone was to get hurt doing this, I&#039;d want it to be me.<br /><br />Looking through news articles, here are mistakes I see people making when they rob a pharmacy.<br /><br />1. They rob a mom and pop pharmacy instead of a chain. Usually what happens is the pharmacist is also the owner, and that fucker is going to shoot your ass to save his place of business that feeds his children.<br /><br />2. The person walks in, and claims to have a weapon without showing it. The pharmacists are not going to take you as serious if you&#039;re not waving a weapon around.<br /><br />3. They act too calm or act afraid. If I did it, I&#039;d be yelling and causing commotion, and freaking everyone out. The last thing I&#039;d want is to not be taken seriously.<br /><br />4. They rob a pharmacy that&#039;s already been robbed. If a pharmacy has been robbed already, the people working there have probably put a lot of thought about what they would do the next time it happened.<br /><br />5. The pharmacist gives them the drugs, and throws a GPS device in along with the drugs. I&#039;d drive a car, and throw the bag of drugs in a big metal box that would be located in the trunk of the car. GPS signals won&#039;t travel through the metal box and the trunk of the car.<br /><br />These are the main mistakes I see. It seems like the people who rob pharmacies are just drug addicted thugs that don&#039;t put any thought into it. I think if you cased the place, and put some organization and thought into it, it would be all too easy. I bet I&#039;m not the only one here who&#039;s thought of doing this. Give me your input, please.<br /><br />BTW, in case you&#039;re wondering why I want to do this, it&#039;s not because I&#039;m addicted to drugs. I&#039;d want to sell the drugs, because I need money for medical problems. I barely make enough to get by at my shitty job, and I&#039;m losing my mind and starting to feel desperate. I know I won&#039;t really do this, I just like to entertain wild fantasies to help me cope. Weird, I know.

				Can you really think of no better way to make money or get drugs than robbing a pharmacy?&nbsp; 1st you need a weapon for them to take you seriously, so you will be looking at armed robbery which is huge time.&nbsp; If you are really hellbent on doing something so illegal why not grow pot in some forest or something and sell it risking a year or 2 in jail rather than 30.&nbsp; Also you can get killed, it&#039;s happened many times and people will not feel sorry for you. Is that really how you want to be remembered?

				Thanks everybody for your input. <br /><br />Everyone keeps saying I might go to prison/jail. That&#039;s OK, because in prison at least I will get free health care and my medical issues will get addressed. Some say I may die, and that&#039;s OK too.

				There are LOTS of reasons not to rob pharmacies, let alone chain stores with the best security money can buy.<br />Not to mention a hell of a lot more shoppers, and shoppers coming from a demographic known to often be armed.<br />Waving a toy gun around, or a real one, you will get shot. Will.

You have enough assets and skills to use an Internet enabled computer (and to own one).<br /><br />B. The wages of IRL crime is jail. The wages of online and white collar crime is not too bad.<br /><br />C.

				I&#039;d be lying if I said years ago, when my habit was at its worst, that there weren&#039;t times when I was so sick in withdrawal that the thought crossed my mind. I don&#039;t think I would have ever had the guts to do it, but I worked as a pharmacy tech at a place down the road for a year or so when I was in my teens so I would have known EXACTLY where to go and for what, the door code, hours, etc. The schedule III and IV stuff like hydrocodone and xanax were right above where they count the pills, the schedule II stuff like oxy and the good stuff were in a glass case beside the refrigerator with insulin, etc. Of course now that I&#039;m a functioning part of &quot;society&quot; the thought of something like that scares me to death.<br /><br />So I mean from an addicts standpoint I can sort of understand why someone would feel so desperate they actually consider things like that an option, but like you said you just want to make money so I can&#039;t really relate to that, you&#039;d be better off robbing a bank they&#039;re basically the same? <br /><br />And I would think there&#039;s no such thing as &quot;directions&quot; for how to pull off robbing a pharmacy, I mean it&#039;s pretty clear cut what you do and there&#039;s no how-to for not facing the likely consequences, I&#039;d say whether you get away with it or not is more dependent on chance than anything. <br /><br />Haha or you could do what one guy I heard about on the news did and rob a pharmacy with a blood-filled syringe and tell them it&#039;s filled with your HIV+ blood and you will stick a bitch if they don&#039;t give you the drugs!!!

				It&#039;s just this fucked up mentality which is making it harder all the time for all of us to get prescribed our painkillers/anxyiolotics. <br />You&#039;d only steal the benzos &amp; opiates that are on time delay safes over here now wouldnt you? YEP. Cos&#039; they&#039;re worth money<br />&nbsp;on&nbsp; the street, and the more c*nts like you even consider, robbing, forging scripts etc.etc.etc. the harder it is for us who NEED this<br />shit for legitimate reasons, the more reluctant doctors are to to prescribe them to us. And they dont care, about us either naahhh, <br />just last month a doctor who had prescribed my wife xanax 4mg /day, just cut her off, because some desperate, greedy fuck tried altering<br />her pad from 50 to 150....how fucking stupid. He fucked it up for many, many, many paople, over 100. Havent seen him around.<br />Now Im here making up for that $6 script, which was every 3 weeks, looking at domestic posts of 5 bars for $42, and if you buy a bottle of 50,<br />you get, have a guess a discount to $267 for a bot of 50, full chemist price less than $20. I mmay as well buy 100 bars for the bargain of $503.<br />Haaaa, who buys this shit??????<br />

				Why don&#039;t you find a lab in China that will make pharmaceuticals for you, then you can get a lot more and cheap too. People who rob pharmacies and banks are dumb as fuck, 98% of them get away with a few hundred bucks worth of shit at extreme risk. If you want to risk your life there are far more profitable ways to do it. I mean, I would at least do something that would make me more money than a week working at McDonalds but hey I am not a fucking retard.

				Best way isn&#039;t to raid the pharmacy at all.&nbsp; Case it out for a few weeks and determine when the deliveries are made.&nbsp; When the truck driver is backing into the unloading area just hold him up, tie him up if you have to, open the trailer, go in ... CLOSE THE TRAILER, and search for your treasure.&nbsp; Escape.&nbsp; Profit.<br /><br />Trailers sit in the unloading zone of these stores for hours sometimes while waiting for other trucks currently offloading to finish and it doesn&#039;t look abnormal at all for there to be a truck parked in the unloading zone.<br /><br />FICTION :D

				1. You enter the pharmacy and act like a tough guy.<br /><br />2. With your finger-gun in your hoodie&#039;s pocket, you get shot in the face from momma-pharmacist. She had a real gun under the counter.<br /><br />3. You die in the ER.<br /><br />4. Profit.

Or mounted sniper rifle with a triggering mechanism linked to a communications network of some sort. The main goal is to maintain distance from the target, in order to avoid forensic trace evidence being left behind, eye witnesses and a potentially quick apprehension.&nbsp; Trace evidence from the firing position needs to be avoided, trace evidence on the delivery device needs to be avoided.Trace evidence on the payload is something to avoid as well, sniper rifle bullets should not be touched at any stage, of course bought with cash. Bombs are harder to remove trace evidence from. Reconnaissance on the target to plan the point of attack as well as determining the best potential escape route. Professional hitmen tend to immediately drop the weapon.&nbsp; All materials used should be unlinkable to the assassin. Transmitting devices should not be carried to the location the attack is launched from (the original positioning location of the UAV or remote controlled sniper rifle), identifiable vehicles should also be avoided. Depending on the specifics it may be possible to take a route that is under no surveillance to the attack launching location. <br /><br />Mostly the perfect murder involves avoiding leaving trace evidence on the murder weapon, payload, scene and launch location, in addition to maintaining unlinkability to any of the utilized locations or materials. Remote control mini helicopter has the benefit that it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact launch location, but the disadvantage that the helicopter and the payload it delivers (likely explosives) need to be completely free of any trace evidence. <br /><br />One technique that a few intelligence agencies have utilized is umbrellas with hollowed out stems that can shoot poisoned pellets out of their tips. Wear a raincoat and wait for heavy rain to coincide with the target being exposed, walk past them and launch the pellet into them from the umbrella. They feel a small sting at first and then die hours or days later, the umbrella is carried with the assassin and the poison pellet&nbsp; immediately dissolves in the targets body.

				WINSLOW TOWNSHIP, N.J. (CBS) – Winslow Township police say a Camden County pharmacist turned the tables on a would-be robber Wednesday.<br /><br />Around 2 p.m., a man allegedly armed with a gun entered Jolin’s Pharmacy at 412 Sicklerville Road in Winslow Township and demanded Oxycontin from the pharmacist.<br /><br />Police say the pharmacist, identified as Dr. John Agyemang, distracted the suspect by telling him there was someone entering the store. While the suspect turned around, Agyemang ran to the back of the store and got his gun, according to police.<br /><br />The suspect fled the store, with the pharmacist chasing after him. Authorities say Agyemang fired at least five shots at the suspect outside the pharmacy.

				very easy to break in a pharmacy during the midnight hours but you need help. It&#039;s not a one man show. One thing that&#039;s always good to have is a decoy and a police scanner so you know when your budies have caused the police to all go to the same spot. Even then you need to case the place out for months and pick that perfect night when you know the shelves are stocked full. You ever thought of digging a tunnel and coming up thru the pharmacy floor at 2 am? There&#039;s a level of sophistication that flat out embarrasses the police. Anybody want to plan some shit?

				i used to work in a mom &amp; pop pharmacy in a town of 1800 residents. their security was a lot worse than those &quot;chain store Pharmacy&#039;s&quot; you are thinking about hittin, and trust me even that much is enough to get you popped. when i worked in that pharmacy all i did was smoke a little bud every now and then. one night someone broke into the pharmacy and stole a bunch of shit, cops came and took fingerprints and then my boss gave me the afternoon off because the cops wanted me to go in for an interview (all employees were interviewed) and even though i didnt do a damn thing wrong, going to the police station and having to talk to the cop was the scariest damn thing ive ever done in my entire life LOL! they caught the dude in 4 days and he got 20 years in WA state... wouldnt do it bro...

				there&#039;s a mom and pop pharmacy I used once where the pharm tech lives in the back as his permanent residence. its really weird because I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s legal under Pharmacy Board rules/restrictions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Interesting place because they had everything even Schedule 2 product sitting on cheap looking racks close enough to the customers - I could practically read the text on the bottles (and my eyesight isn&#039;t perfect).&nbsp; <br /><br />Also I saw an episode of Alaska State Troopers or something where someone busted into a pharmacy through the roof at night and used a saw or something to cut through.&nbsp; Troopers came by the next day and took prints but didn&#039;t find any because the perp was wearing gloves.. so wear gloves.
