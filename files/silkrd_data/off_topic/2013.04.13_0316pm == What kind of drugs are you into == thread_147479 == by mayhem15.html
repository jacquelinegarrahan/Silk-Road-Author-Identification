				Weed and Psychedelics. Particularly mushrooms and LSD. I&#039;ve recently been trying to stop smoking weed though, but the thing is I don&#039;t want to completely stop smoking I just want to cut down a whole lot. It&#039;s not easy but I&#039;m still trying though.

				#1 MDMA definitely. I would roll every day if I could. Only let myself once every 3 or 4 months though.<br />#2 I&#039;d say speed, just because I use it regularly to keep me functioning. Don&#039;t really use it for the high.<br />#3 LSD/shrooms<br /><br />Wish I could force myself to like weed.

				MDMA/MDA: The stuff is magical.<br /><br />Speed: For getting stuff done and helping to court ladies while socializing.<br /><br />LSD: For exploration.<br /><br />Mushrooms: For spiritual cleansing and the whole frame of mind reset you get after a trip. They really seem to rid your brain of any jaggedness and get the blood flowing properly.<br />

				I&#039;ve tried all sorts of drugs and feel blessed to have had the opportunity to do so, but I think I&#039;ve settled down to a few main ones that I can use once in a while and allow me to carry on with a busy, productive lifestyle. <br /><br />-Meth for getting shit done<br />-Mephedrone - go-to for partying and feeling good, better than coke and meth for this purpose imo.<br />-Ketamine - great for come-downs and the occasional psychedelic k-hole experience.<br />-Etizolam for sleep and occasionally for partying or whatever else a benzo may come in handy for<br />-Opium for a chill high.<br />-GHB for sex and stim come-downs.

				MDMA - I try for no more then every two months.. but never more then once a month... 4 to 6 weeks is my rule of thumb on that <br /><br />Bk-MDMA - For being at home and wanting a calmer more connected experience with my other half. <br /><br />LSD-25 - When I can find some that is legit&nbsp; <br /><br />Shrooms -&nbsp; Working on a batch right now..&nbsp; Hope to be a vender coming up with them.. <br /><br />GHB - Mostly for the MDMA and Bk-MDMA but going to try it some on its own coming up.. <br /><br />Special K&nbsp; -&nbsp; a tiny bit now and then.. not often<br /><br />Ambien - For a nice clean refreshing sleep (not after the GHB, never mix the two)<br /><br />Any of the good pain killers :)<br /><br />Looking into some Herb for pain management. Never been my thing but from reading up on the subject it sounds like it&#039;s worth a try. There are so many Canna products available today it&#039;s a bit over whelming to start out .. Met a very nice guy here on the road who is going to help me out some with that.. Can&#039;t wait to see how useful it is<br /><br />

				I love smoking Cannabis. I&#039;m into Psychedelics such as Mushrooms, LSD, and MDMA. Those four drugs are my favorites. Though lately I&#039;ve been dabbing in the NBOMe research chemicals. I have no interest in hard drugs like Cocaine, Heroin, Methamphetamine, etc. you know.

				Cannabis is great! I have recently decided to give up the habit on and off for an extended period of time. I let the habit get the best of me and it began to get in the way of my studies and what not. <br /><br />I had a decent LSD trip yesterday that put thangs into perspective. The only drug/s I am willing to try soon are MDMA and DMT.
