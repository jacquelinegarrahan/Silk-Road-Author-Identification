What are your tips for selling large amounts at raves and having large amounts of cash on your person?

				1) Don&#039;t be bait about it, prepare to walk away at the first sight of police if it gets shut down.<br />2) Use common sense.<br />3) I would probably sell 1 pill per person with the kombats/nitendo&#039;s because e-tards never fucking listen when you say start with half or whole at max with these ~200mg pills. Seen to many people put them selves into horrific states because they dont listen and are used to ~80mg pills and drop 3 at a time. <br />4) Use some friends you can trust to help you deal and give them a cut of the money, I wouldn&#039;t recommend carrying £1000 on you at once, if a crackhead (of which there are many, especially in london parties) found out you were carrying £1000 on you, you would most likely be mugged within seconds. <br />6) When you spark a deal, take them out of the rave a bit, but still in view of other people, have a get away plan if shit turns bad. <br />5) good luck!

				To be honest, you&#039;d be better off selling average quality pills at a rave. People usually sell crap at raves &amp; festivals (at least in Australia), and therefore they buy several and eat them all at once.<br />You&#039;d make more money and it&#039;d be safer to sell average quality pills.<br />
