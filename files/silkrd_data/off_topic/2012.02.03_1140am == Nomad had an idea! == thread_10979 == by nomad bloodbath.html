				I liquidated all my btc and many from several vendors....my idea was that this was a huge weekend for SR&nbsp; buyers.<br />Yet left and right i was hearing complaints about about dwolla seizing assets or mt gox doing the same...spoiling everyone&#039;s fun.<br />So in the earlier hours of the morn around 5:41am. I decided to spare as many buyers as I could with my btc&#039;s and any btc &#039;s I could get my hands on so that this weekend would not be a drag for as few as possible. After about 12 hours I had exchanged nearly 500+BTC,hopefully that will purchase many happy people drugs of their choice. I know my drugs of choice will arrive this weekend and throughout next week.<br /><br />I hope I set an example for the community, i hope i showed that the easiest way, is the honest way and no one has to suffer in the freeworld of Silkland.<br />I hope others will follow my example and be kind to the community be truthful vendors and buyers alike.<br /><br />SilkRoad made it a full year, wouldnt it be nice if 10 years the community was flourishing and striving, not only in drugs but homemade items,food, collectibles and community created items one of a kind only found in SILKLAND.<br /><br />Everyone needs to take a minute step back and decide that the best thing for the community is the community.<br />We have a very special place here and every single member should be involved with the community in one way or another.<br /><br /><br />Live Long Silk Road and Flourshish....we are the future.<br /><br />&nbsp;:) <br />nomad bloodbath<br /><br />
