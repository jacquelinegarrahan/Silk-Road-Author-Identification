				Are you gonna make it? Are you? I passed the house we used to live at and there the past was lingering. I drank a lot to try and forget you now I&#039;m smoking all the time in hopes that in itself can create me happiness. You don&#039;t have to fret, if you do that as well with your new girlfriend. I was doing just fine until I went inside the fast food place and saw that girl who looked just like you. The haircut, the hat, the tattoos....and that same mouth and dagger for eyes. I never used to remember you with such acrimony. It&#039;s been many years now but when I fall asleep and awake to the bright sky, I remember your face beneath my eyelids just for a second. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I do have my days where I get up off my feet and I move forward I just leave behind my mind for a moment that has you tracing into the crevices of my brain. Some times I don&#039;t know who I am and I go around smiling just because and when someone asks, &quot;Why are you so happy?&quot; and I just continue to smile because I&#039;m at peace, finally. Without you.

So I knew she&#039;d get all fired up just by her words she chose when messaging me. <br /><br /><br />I thought 23 transferred to smoking weed after drinking a lot? Perhaps that&#039;s just what I assumed. Could be something else though--like crack or something.

You think you know someone until you see what they do when they think they&#039;re alone online. Confirmed she was cheating on me, kept the keylogger and did some shady shit like anonymously email her parents transcripts of her email on how she was paying off her new boyfriends debts with money given to her for college expenses. She thought her email was hacked, changed her passwords. I didn&#039;t even care about her anymore but I couldn&#039;t stop looking at her logs until one day I guess she reformatted.<br /><br />Now days I don&#039;t think I&#039;d give a shit, if my girlfriend told me she cheated on me I&#039;d probably just say, &quot;That&#039;s nice, did he buy you dinner first? Can you pick me something up on your way home?&quot;

				I can tell you from personal experience, lesbian drama is just as it is. Lesbian drama. We all inspire the tv shows and movies.<br /><br />I can tell you though, it doesn&#039;t matter where you go whether you move to another state or country. She will always be in your mind. So you can never run away which means you shouldn&#039;t run away in the first place. Just let it go. And that&#039;s the hardest part, letting go. So we all take drugs or drink and nostalgia hits and word of mouth hits home.<br /><br />I still have dreams of my ex yet she is accompanied by her current partner, so I guess my brain isn&#039;t as fucked as I thought. <br />
