				After somebody brought up the post about how bitcoin vendors charge $0.00 for their listings and&nbsp; if they pay the fee.<br /><br />It got me wondering does SR rad our messages to check vendors are not saying to trusted repeat customers, But the one gram listing that&#039;s really 2 grams and send the other half direct to my account p2p so I can save a bit on fees and will throw you in a bit more, Wink wink.<br /><br />Lots of people go the same vendor who they trust and it&#039;s bound to happen that working relationships develop in some cases.<br />It has to happen I&#039;m sure so I&#039;m just wondering what&#039;s done about it and are people caught<br />

				It&#039;s very possible that PMs on SR are read by SR staff. Based on my interactions with them they&#039;re very nice and I don&#039;t think they would, but you never know. In this game you gotta stay on your toes. That&#039;s why you should use PGP for anything secretive! :D<br /><br />They&#039;ve also read PMs when there have been accusations of vendor misconduct or when things go to the resolution center. Obviously if somebody PMs a vendor &quot;give me free shit or I&#039;ll ruin you&quot;, then SR staff would need to know about that.<br /><br />But tl;dr use PGP yo.

				Good question re encryption - I think PGP must always be safer than not, particularly if the bigger picture is avoiding incriminating yourself. The ability for the admins to read messages is pretty vital in a dispute, usually somebody&#039;s word against anothers - stats alone don&#039;t always tell the whole truth and must be mega frustrating if the decision wrongly goes against you. The admins need all they can get to decide, not easy. <br /><br />It would be fascinating to know general stats &amp; trends for the site eg what percentage of buyers / sellers do go out of the system as you describe, how many top vendors there are, how many scammers, how much FE goes on, how many DEA agents are signed up, how much tin foil gets used on the hats (with good reason). Stuff that will always remain a mystery.

				Of course the answer is yes......they can read them.....do they?.....only if they need to........There is always customers wanting to do business outside of escrow.....I get asked at least weekly.<br /><br />My answer is always a firm NO......against SR policy.......SR has been very good to me....why would I ever want to do that?<br /><br />Now if you use PGP....back and forth......all messages would be encrypted and only your and the other person would be able to read any messages......for any sensitive information....always use PGP........SR is not the enemy.....LE is .....that is why you must use PGP....... :)
