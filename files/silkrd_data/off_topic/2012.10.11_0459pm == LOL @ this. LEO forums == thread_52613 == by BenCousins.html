				Wow, reading that makes me SO angry! like when i talk to someone that has their head up their ass so far there&#039;s no hope of them even listening to what you say.&nbsp; They just keep repeating themselves with the propaganda and canned responses they&#039;ve faithfully committed to memory regardless of what you say.&nbsp; When talking to people like this you can see they often get angry and the few chances you have to say something their eyes glaze over and they are utilizing the childish SELECTIVE HEARING from their prepubescent years.<br /><br />/rant
