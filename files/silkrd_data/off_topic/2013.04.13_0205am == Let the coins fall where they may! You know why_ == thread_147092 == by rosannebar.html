				So coins are in a free fall,&nbsp; and to that I say.&nbsp; &nbsp;Let them get down to 50 or lower.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Then,&nbsp; I will buy and hold on to a few.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, I know some people have coin tied up now that is causing massive heart attacks and bad days.<br /><br />However, I was one of the ones saying, I wish I had got some to sit on before they went up to 200!&nbsp; damn.....<br /><br />I thought I had missed a chance,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; for all of those who were feeling like they missed the boat,&nbsp; let me tell you my theory,<br /><br />I think when they start to rise again, they are going to climb back up well over 100,&nbsp; maybe even higher then last time.&nbsp; &nbsp;( of course they will crash again, but the trick will be selling off before then )<br /><br />To all of those that lost money, I feel your pain, to all those that were wishing you had stocked up on coin, then now will be your chance.&nbsp; &nbsp; Agree?

				You got it right.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Intelligent.&nbsp; I like the fact your karma is low. It means you are truthful and express yourself properly. <br /><br />Most people here pretend to be all stuck up and dignified like they don&#039;t use drugs or something. Like they never licked the bottom of an empty Baggie before ?&nbsp; Ya right .&nbsp; The rest keep trying to impress vendors for hopes of free drugs here .&nbsp; Keep dreaming.&nbsp; &nbsp;The serious players are too busy buying up drugs on the main site to bother trying to make sense of any of the cranky negative posts here.&nbsp; Bah!<br /><br />Buy your coins low. And sell high<br /><br />I got trolled today for saying just that.&nbsp; &nbsp;I made over $546.33 today when coins were low.&nbsp; I waited and sold everything to buy those low coins.&nbsp; Now yet are $105.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Doubled my money AGAIN. Three weeks running <br /><br />Don&#039;t listen to anyone here. They want you to fail.&nbsp; Keep up your plan. <br /><br />We are all here for the same reason to buy drugs and talk about them in an open discussion.
