				I am a complete n00b when it comes to RCs. I found out about JWH-018 because of silk road, read upon it, decided it looks pretty awesome and ordered some for sampling. What else I should check out? I&#039;m into weed, shrooms, lsd... Thinking about trying out some molly. Are there any chemicals with similar effects? Maybe something cheap and/or (semi)legal?<br /><br />Share your knowledge!

				2C-I/E/P and 4-Aco-DMT are some very worthwhile psychedelic RCs. Methylone and mephedrone are good feel-good stimulants although the latter is cardiotoxic. Methoxetamine is a great dissociative, and one of my favorite drugs.

				Not tough bro,<br /><br />Young and restless. ;)<br /><br />But in all honesty, it is a PUSSY 2C.

				I have very little experience with RCs but I am quite fascinated with the scene. The only RC I&#039;ve tried is MDPV, and that is one brutal fucker. Especially if you smoke it. I bought a gram of it and went through about 400mg over the course of three and a half days. I didn&#039;t sleep at all, nor did I eat, and lost 10 pounds. After a while it&#039;s just the stimulation of Crack or Meth but with no euphoria or positive effects. Stay away from that bitch, I thought it would be a great study aid like adderall or Dexedrine, but the desire to redose is way too strong.

				Thanks for all the replies guys. Did some reading on all of the mentioned chemicals. Methylone and MXE seems like something I was looking for. I&#039;m especially intrigued by antidepressant qualities of MXE. Its gonna be my next purchase. It seems it&#039;s not even illegal in my country. <br />Any recommendations for MXE vendors? SilkRoad prices seems a bit high compared to buy-jwh.com. Maybe there are legit online vendors with even better prices? <br /><br />If someone would pass me a free MXE or methylone sample in EU I would be most grateful;)<br /><br />Thanks

				@bob<br />You won&#039;t find a better deal than at buy-jwh. They ship from hungary or china, and all packages are tracked and with signature, and there will be no stealth at all: if you get MXE from them, it&#039;s very likely there will be a big &quot;METH&quot; label on the plastic bag inside your package (I&#039;m serious lol). The guy&#039;s english is a bit funky, but hey :)<br /><br />If you are looking for antidepressant, I&#039;d advise using &quot;real&quot; antidepressants, that have undergone massive and long clinical trials, such as sertraline or paroxetine. Paroxetine is a SSRI, and so is sertraline. Sertraline also has an action on dopamine.<br />If you are really depressed or feeling too &quot;empty&quot; to get things done, those products can change your life without potentially screwing up your brain&#039;s reward mechanism.<br />The choice is yours of course, but if you&#039;d follow anything out of my advice, document yourself extensively - then decide!

				I can send MXE to the UK however, be aware I don&#039;t claim any liability etc for lost packages, haven&#039;t had any real issues with any customs though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, me personally wouldn&#039;t suggest SSRI&#039;s to ANYONE... SSRI&#039;s have terrible side effects and rarely provide worthwhile effects.. (this is my opinion) <br /><br />DXM has a very anti depressant like AFTER GLOW for me ;)

				@Rapid: No guts to chuck down the whole dirty tasting syrup? Or actually scared about your guts? :P :P<br />Teasing aside, DXM is a very old memory for me, and I&#039;d like to try it once, once again. Powder form would be lovely to &quot;motivate&quot; a friend or two in accompagnying me! Most chemical suppliers, however &amp; as expected, supply in bulk only...<br /><br />@Enboom: I know SSRI&#039;s have a &quot;terrible&quot; reputation, but having been on paxil for quite a while in the past, I must say I never understood why. Of course, everyone is different, and especially no-one is equal in the &quot;side effects business&quot;, but for me and my several month experience, it has been a blessing. It didn&#039;t solve my &quot;depression&quot;, sure, but it did give me the strenght and more specifically the laid-back-attitude to fix what was wrong in my life at that time (long story short, my relationships with people -can&#039;t have the same level of expectations with others than which I enforce on myself)!<br />Side effects.. side effects... besides a datura-style dry mouth and the (ffs) delayed orgams... That was it! Dry mouth was annoying, sure, but you get used to it! Delayed orgasm was annoying for me, but this could be a blessing to others!<br />I say it again, I really don&#039;t understand why people all bitch about SSRIs (especially here in the EU)! They aren&#039;t addictive and there are no withdrawal effects. Sure, MDMA doesn&#039;t work while in treatment, but that saves the crash.<br />That being said, I had a moderate dose (20mg daily)... Some people take 40 or more, and that... *That* might be a whole different story... that once again drives me off topic, but hell! I double dosed once to &quot;try&quot;, and hard to describe, but it felt like I was &quot;super stoned&quot; for a day and that feelings were numbed: nothing felt bad for sure, but nothing felt great either...<br />Sorry for drifting off subject, but I had to share my exp :)

				&quot; They aren&#039;t addictive and there are no withdrawal effects. &quot;<br /><br />hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome.<br /><br />You&#039;re altering your brain chemistry. I&#039;m sure for some people they can be a blessing, especially when they are clinically depressed, however, the over prescription of them and things like Adderal cause changes in brain chemistry. Espeicially for doctors who are unaware of dimensional scale and Rx regardless.

				I agree they aren&#039;t addictive, but there is definitely withdrawal if you suddenly stop taking them after using them for a while. I took Zoloft 100mg a day for around 6 months and quit cold turkey. I was restless, irritable, had wild mood swings and those damn electric shock sensations for about a week.

				Seems it does have some effects afterall! I never felt anything, but everyone is different.. i&#039;m sure it&#039;s &quot;worth&quot; it though!<br />And as for adderal, it&#039;s still amphetamines, so no wonder :P<br /><br />@Rapid, that&#039;s a deal !!!

				2C-b is my current favorite. it&#039;s a great deal of fun without any serious consequence from what i see. it has a nice mdma sort of body high except there&#039;s no lovey dovey, along with decent visuals at about 25 - 30 milligrams. there&#039;s domestic usa shipped on sr right now too&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/user/68461

				2C-B. I would recommend it to anyone, such a beautiful substance. It has been so widely used for so many years now that I do not really consider it an RC anymore though.<br /><br />Cheers.

				If you can get your hands on some JWH-018, get as much as you can.<br />Next to that, I think AM-2201 is quite popular.
