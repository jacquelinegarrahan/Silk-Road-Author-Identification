				Keith Richards : Lead Guitar player of the rolling stones. Still alive, how?<br /><br />He must have, at his drug taking peak, been doing Speedballs(coke with H) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! And I bet you could include Tea Time and some after groupie orgy meals too.<br /><br />I bet drug dealers were giving away to him, their A+ top of the line stuff just to hang around the guy ( and maybe get some groupie leftovers).<br /><br />Ok, here&#039;s my theory: He was cloned in a top secret experimental science lab, just when the stones started getting famous. The clones are all Keith&#039;s present age, and age normally in the lab while being kept in comas. He actually died about 8 times due to O.D. They are on now on version 9.0 Keith clone.<br /><br />Now you may ask yourself, if you know about rolling stones history, Why wasn&#039;t there a clone made of Brian Jones then? Could he could have been replaced too, when he died? Well, he was kicked out, so the lab killed his clones when that happened.<br /><br />What&#039;s your theory?

				Genetics.. It seems to me that some people can do everything in their fucking power to die early and they still keep trucking. Other people do everything in their power to live to a hundred and die from a heart attack at fifty. <br /><br />Boring yes, likely the real reason for his longevity, yes.<br /><br />ORRRRRRRR<br /><br />He discovered some secret drug that we don&#039;t know about that is keeping him alive?<br />&nbsp;:o

				If you want to read a really good book, check out his autobiography &quot;Life&quot;. There are some really great stories in there and alot of reflection on this topic itself and the amount of drugs he&#039;s done. <br /><br />It&#039;s a bit long and there are a few dry parts in it but it&#039;s a great fucking read into a guy that is a legend in more ways than one.

				he isnt the only one though, Bowie still looks pretty damn good for his age and that guy was easily as mental as richards, he was no keith moon though (when confronted by a concerned ringo star who said that if moon carried on the way he was he was going to die, his reply was simply &quot;yeah i know&quot;) and of course we have to give an honorable mention to our beloved Dr Shulgin, he may not be in the best of health these days but he is 86 and thats a damn good run even for someone whos led a clean life!

				Some people can just handle their shit better than others. I imagine he also took drugs all through his teenage years which trained his body to cope.

Yeah, I read in a interview with him once somewhere, that he once went through a period of time on a diet consisting only of milk and green peppers. That&#039;s all he would consume like for months. Must have been some good drugs.... or bad considering he was kinda wasting away then. Think it was around his &#039;White Duke&#039; days.

Secret drugs that convert H and coke into life giving fluids. Or Like keith is a x-men mutant with the genetics. Well, yes I agree you were actually more serious and real with the genetics. <br /><br />That reminds me of the joke that only two things left alive before the end of world will be : Cockroaches, and Keith Richards. Or you could add a third with Cher (with all the plastic surgery she had done thru the years). I&#039;d add a fourth even with Donald Trump&#039;s hair piece. Yes, that hair piece is alive. I think he feeds it benzos to keep it still on his head.

Hmm... so old rock guitarists forced to duel each other to achieve ultimate power? Think Keith might have some trouble going toe to toe with Eric Clapton. Or Jeff Beck.

				Lemmy is also still alive. Hofmann lived to 102. Some people just get lucky, most drop like flies from 10% of what people like Keith have done in one year.<br /><br />
