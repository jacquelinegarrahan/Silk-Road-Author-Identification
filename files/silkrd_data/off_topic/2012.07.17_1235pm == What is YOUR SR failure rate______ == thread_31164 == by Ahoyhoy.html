				5 transactions<br /><br />1-3 went swimmingly. 5/5<br />4 Vendor didn&#039;t process order within 5 days so I canceled it.<br />5 Item never arrived, seller ignored all communication, got 100% refund via resolution (If he communicated I would have split the loss).<br /><br />Now I have about an 80% refund rate, gonna have to start with a fresh buyer account. My old one looks pretty shit now. On my new account I will only be buying from UK vendors in small transactions (under £50) until I have built up some respectable stats. All it takes is one penis to fuck it up tho.

				100% success rate so far for me - just make sure you go with reputable and established vendors.&nbsp; Too much to lose looking for a quick bargain or trying to save a few BTC - including, and most importantly, your name and address.

				Placed 11 orders in the past of which 4 never came, and 1 more Im currently waiting unusually long for (from US), plus a reship of one of the missing ones Im waiting 2 weeks+ for now (Europe - Europe)&nbsp; not sure if either will arrive or just late... to Norway.<br />I have received 1 x 50% refund<br />I have possibly been scammed 1-4times or more if current orders doesnt show and I don&#039;t hear from customs either..&nbsp; 2 of the missing packages were just 5tabs of LSD each,one of these was my very first order (shoulda been extra easy to get thru customs?)<br />Only ordered from popular long established vendors

				Thanks for this guys. + 1 karma to all of you.<br /><br />OK, some maths. Of the responses received so far I think it breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Total transactions: 179<br />Item didn&#039;t arrive but refund received: 10 (5,6%)<br />Scams: 3 (1.67%)<br /><br />I call that a pretty good testimony to the SR system<br /><br />Keep those stats coming in. <br /><br />+1 karma to all contributors. <br /><br /><br />

One could roll a die three times and get three sixes in a row but wouldn&#039;t assume that the probability of rolling a six was therefore 100%. At this stage in the data collection process we&#039;d probably need to apply a large confidence interval to any % probability and reduce it slowly as further data was added.

				So let&#039;s build a 99% confidence interval for the probability of you being scammed ;)<br /><br />The confidence interval for a bernoulli population at α(1-100%) is given by the following formula:<br />]E(X) - Z(1-α/2)*sqr( (E(X)(1-E(X) ) / n ) ; E(X) + Z(1-α/2)*sqr( (E(X)(1-E(X) ) / n )[<br /><br />Let p be the probability of you being scammed, p=1/35, which is also the expected value.<br />Let n=35 be our sample size.<br />Since 1-α=0.99, α=0.01, therefore Z(1-α/2)=Z(1-0.005)=Z(0.995). Doing a reverse look-up on our Z-Table, Z(0.995)~= 2.575.<br /><br />No we are ready to substitute the values in our initial formula:<br />]1/35 - 2.575 * sqr( (1/35*(1-1/35) / 35 ) ; 1/35 + 2.575 * sqr( (1/35*(1-1/35) / 35 )[<br /><br />Calculating it gives:<br />]-0,0439413631 ; 0,10108422[<br /><br />So the true probability of you being scammed should lie somewhere between this interval, but I&#039;m getting a negative probability which doesn&#039;t seem right at all. I&#039;ll check what&#039;s happening.

				In 21 transactions over 11 months... my first order, for LSD, I got scammed. Luckily this did not put me off, and helped me learn how to avoid future scams (which mostly boils down to &quot;never finalise early&quot;, though I make one exception to that rule for a great weed vendor who requires it, and who has always delivered high quality stuff). A few months later, an order from a well-trusted weed vendor never turned up, and his replacement package didn&#039;t turn up either, but due to his very high reputation I doubt he scammed me - I guess something just went weird in the mail. A few months later another weed order from a new vendor arrived, but it was really nasty gritweed - the sort where the ash from a joint stays as one solid unbroken lump, then in the next day or two turned into nasty oily shit, the vendor claimed surprise and claimed he&#039;d send out new uncontaminated stuff but never did, and everyone else was complaining so I think this was just a wanker who thought he&#039;d get away with selling awful crap on SR - his rapidly plummeting feedback soon dispelled that notion. Then a few weeks ago, a previously well respected weed vendor stopped fulfilling orders, seemingly scammed a lot of people and never lived up to his promise to refund or reship, but I was lucky enough to get a full refund through the resolution centre (probably helped that he never bothered to reply in the resolution centre and a lot of people were complaining, SR staff gave me the full refund, not the vendor in question).<br /><br />So that&#039;s 4 transactions in 21 that didn&#039;t go as planned, 3 where I actually lost money due to it (I&#039;m counting the gritweed as a loss here as nasty contaminated marriage-oowana isn&#039;t exactly what I ordered), 3 which truly appear to have been scams, 2 where I received no product and no refund. Though I&#039;m not sure if &quot;processing&quot;/&quot;in transit&quot; orders show up in the purchasing stats, if they do then it&#039;s 19 transactions total as I have a couple that haven&#039;t arrived yet.

				Total transactions: 7<br />Total spent: ฿43.43<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 10 months<br /><br />I know I do not have that many transactions(I don&#039;t particularly like drugs in the mail with my address on the package), but it seems easy enough not to get scammed. Only buy from vendors that would have more to lose than gain from scamming you. <br />You want to read up on a vendor you like anyways, look at their post count, their ratings, their vendor reviews. You can usually get a feel of their attitude towards selling, security, drug safety and the like just reading posts by them. Would you trust this person with your address? <br />Does the vendor have any scam alerts?<br /><br />I like buying from vendors who have a 98+ rating. Who have had their vendor account for awhile and been selling that whole time. It means that they have been getting out packages consistently and have a process that works. They aren&#039;t making any mistakes regarding packaging or security and people are happy with them. When you buy something from them it&#039;s just business as usual, nothing special or new to figure out.<br /><br />In the beginning, your choice of vendors really is limited. But the more transactions and the larger amount of money you have spent the more choices you have. No competent vendor wants someone with excellent buyer stats calling them a scammer or leaving a bad review.

				Failure rate was 0.00% for a long time including one good transaction with tony76. Based on that first good transaction, I finalized two purchases early because he said it was essential during the 4/20 sale.<br /><br />So I lost $150USD and re-learned what I already knew: Occasionally, there is a reason to risk and out-of-escrow transactions. Occasionally. And you must me willing to accept the loss if something goes wrong.<br /><br />One order from another country got stuck in their postal system for a long time. One order got stuck in my country&#039;s customs for a long time. I was patient and communicated with the vendors and was rewarded with completed transactions.<br /><br />So my refund rate is 0.0% as is my auto-finalize rate. I consider tony76 my teacher. And an asshole.

I took away the largest data point from the survey, but I found that the average was very stable, always around 97.5% or so. If you page scrap the data you&#039;ll see the same.<br /><br />Obviously some members had some bad luck, but again, you have to go to the thread to see for yourself, it&#039;s the last link in my signature.<br /><br />I and many others believe from empirical observation that if the consumer uses PGP encryption they are less likely to be the victims of a selective scam or affected by simple embezzlement. <br /><br />This is because A: the vendor is a lot less likely to think you&#039;re a chump, and B: if the vendor refuses to play ball with PGP, the odds are that he doesn&#039;t have particularly high I.Q to begin with and you should avoid a transaction with that person. Thus, however it works, it works.<br /><br />The interesting thing would be if SR ran a ongoing survey so we could observe trends over time.<br /><br />The problem is that the survey could be biased. I mean, clearly only people on the forum replied to it. It is hard to say which way it is biased too. On one hand, forum regulars are less likely to be inexperienced. And on the other hand, people are far more likely to be on the forum if they have a complaint. So it&#039;s hard to tell.<br /><br />I totted up the data from this specific thread and I got:<br /><br />G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B<br /><br />32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br />62&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br />31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br />33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br />17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br />7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br /><br />Where Totals = 386&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 in summation and;<br /><br />Where G = a perfect transaction and B = some manner of problem e.g. a scam, lost mail, a refund had to be shipped etc<br /><br />The result was 95.07% in terms of Delivery Success Rate. Or 4.92% in terms of Delivery Failure Rate.<br /><br />So you see, the results are really quite stable, and I believe if you wait around until you reach 1000+ packages, then you&#039;ll<br />find that it is very similar to my 97.51% DSR.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Pine<br /><br /><br />
