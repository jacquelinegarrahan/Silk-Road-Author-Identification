				Hey Silk Roaders..<br /><br />So, I was thinking about it. I&#039;m pretty sure I just got setup. I&#039;m in my mid-twenties and have been dating a 16 year old girl for about 3 months now. We&#039;ve been experimenting in the bedroom for awhile now, but most recently it has been without a condom. She&#039;s on birth control, I pull out.. whatever. This girl lives with her father, who hates me, and her brother, who probably would take the father&#039;s side over mine. I was thinking about it, and the day we started having sex without condoms was almost exactly 9 MONTHS before her 17th birthday. About a week later, she said she was feeling sick. <br /><br />Incase you don&#039;t put that together, that means she fucking planned this. She wants a baby for her 17th birthday. So everything my friends had warned me about was pretty much true, and now I&#039;m trying to find out a way to prolong me being slammed for it. I divide and conquerer these problems. So the first problem I&#039;m going to face, is her father finding out that she&#039;s pregnant. IF he suspects that she IS pregnant, he will probably ask her to take a test, on the spot. Her dad does this with drug testing already.<br /><br />So I was thinking, after she takes the first test, she still might be feeling sick, etc. So I need a way to buy BULK PASSED/FAILED pregnancy tests. And where could I go online, and even have the possibility of having a FORGERIES section of goodies? Silk motherfuckin&#039; Road. <br /><br />So GET SOME BITCHES TO PEE ON SOME STICKS PEOPLE. I NEED YOUR FUCKING HELP!<br /><br />Much love, kingsandman<br /><br />unpregnant bitches, HOLLAR AT ME.<br /><br />PEACE!<br /><br />PS: Don&#039;t ever send DNA through the mail or anything,<br /><br />JUST GIVE ME SOME IDEAS on how else to handle / prolong this situation! Thanks!

				That&#039;s not the solution, that&#039;s a way to prolong me getting in trouble for it. I know she&#039;s going to still want me around even with the baby, and I want to be around, but I surely don&#039;t want to face any legal trouble that her father might try to give me. I don&#039;t want to be locked up anytime around my kid being born. The legal trouble might be inevitable, but I want to prolong it.

				Are you sure you&#039;re not 16, too? I figured only 16 year olds thought that &quot;pulling out&quot; was viable birth control.<br /><br />Maybe you should look into buying a coathanger and a bottle of whisky instead.

				Don&#039;t drop the soap.<br /><br />Handle this like a man. The father probably hates you for a good reason. If you show him maturity and that you can father this child, then you&#039;ll be on his good side.

				I appreciate all of your input. I know what I did was stupid, I plan to stay around as long as I can for the kid, but like you all said, I will eventually most likely get slammed for it. <br /><br />I obviously wouldn&#039;t ever encourage people to be passing their DNA through the fucking mail on Silk Road.. that was just a joke. I got high as fuck earlier, and started that conspiracy theory thinking bullshit that people do when they are high, and that&#039;s what I came up with for my current situation. I want to enjoy my time with her and my kid, as long as possible, before I (inevitably) get slammed. <br /><br />This could have been planned by her, or maybe it&#039;s pure coincidence. It seems like a very nice plan for her, but I don&#039;t think she realizes (if it is a plan) how not having a father is going to affect her baby.. I don&#039;t think she considered what would happen to me, she&#039;s only looking after her side of the deal. <br /><br />So, breaking this down into the first bad thing that is most likely to happen, she will be sick for a prolonged period of time. The first bad thing that I see happening is her dad, or her sister, or best friends, suspecting something about pregnancy, and will want her to take a test. So yes, the first step in *prolonging* me getting slammed, would be those forged tests. I need time to figure out what I&#039;m going to do after that, that certainly isn&#039;t my solution to this whole problem, I have to take it one step at a time. <br /><br />This is all if I want to stick around, or I could just move back to my home town and be THAT fucking guy who ran away from everything. That&#039;s my last resort, but for now I want to stick around. I appreciate your criticism and your inputs!
