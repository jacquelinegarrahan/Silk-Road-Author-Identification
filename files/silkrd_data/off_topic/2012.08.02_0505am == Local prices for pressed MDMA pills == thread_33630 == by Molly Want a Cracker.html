				I&#039;m interested in seeing the typical prices for one, one hundred, and one thousand pressed MDMA pills in your average large US city. I spoke with someone who swears that he can pick up &quot;jars&quot;, or 100 pills, for $300 to 400, or $3 to 4 per pill. The dealer of these &quot;jars&quot; would have to be getting the pills for almost half the price, $1.50 to $2 per pill, in order to turn a worthwhile profit.<br /><br />After looking around on SR and PM&#039;ing multiple high profile vendors regarding their prices, the absolute cheapest that I&#039;ve found is $3 per pill. The problem is that in order to get this price, one would have to purchase many thousands of pills. At the 100 pill quantity, the average going price on SR is $6, roughly double what is supposedly the average local rate in a large US city.<br /><br />I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that the person who I spoke with is one of the following:<br /><br />1) A huge bullshitter and loves to talk out of his ass<br />2) Gets bunk pills with piperazines, meth, caffiene, and RC&#039;s<br />3) Knows or is very close to someone who presses their own legitimate MDMA pills<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				For pills to contain that amount of MDMA, they would not be that price.<br /><br />150mg pills should be about $5

				You can just get a testing kit and require that he let you test one before buying the jar.

				If one lacks business ethics and does not care about getting hunted down by those who recognize true MDMA, then the most profitable solution by far is to buy boats of methylone or piperazine pressed pills at $1-2 each and flip them as $300 jars for the quickest profit possible. On the other hand, if one has integrity and doesn&#039;t want to worry about getting hunted down because their product is not true MDMA, the only solution short of knowing a local MDMA pill presser is to buy from one of the bulk sellers on SR at $4 per pill by the boat and hope to push jars for $800 each. But who the hell is going to buy a jar for $800 when they can get one from their buddy that looks like Eminem for $300?<br /><br />The problem is that most jar buyers and their clients are ignorant individuals who don&#039;t care what is in their pills. Excluding the rave scene population, I would estimate that less than 5% of the world population knows what MDMA is. However, more than 30% of the world population likely knows what &quot;ecstasy&quot; is. This leaves a large grey area that dishonest dealers can take advantage of. Most people want to get high for the lowest possible cost. In such a situation, pressed MDMA distributors must ask themselves: is it even worth it to push the real thing?

				In large cities in UK, £3 - £6 per pill depending on quality. You can get as low as £2 per pill when buying in bulk.
