				Okay so I rolled mdma last night.<br /><br />And it was intense as fuck. After doing the drug, and reading erowid about it, I&#039;ve concluded that this drug I did in college, which I thought was mdma was not.<br /><br />It lasted longer than mdma. Mdma made me feel a certain clarity about everything. It didn&#039;t have as intense of a body buzz as the stuff I did in college. The college stuff gave me literal waves of euphoria up down my whole body the whole time. I got tracers off the mdma but not what I did in college. The mdma was powder but the stuff from college was a pill (well, actually it was an anal suppository, but I ate it like a pill).<br /><br />What drug do you suppose I did in college? Cuz fuck mdma, I want more of THAT.

				No sir.<br /><br />If what I did last night was mdma, then mdma was not responsible for the buzz I had in college.<br /><br />and I&#039;m pretty sure what I did last night mdma.

				Well what did it look like? <br />Sorry I should make that clearer. Was it a pharmacitical pill or a hand pressed? Did it have a picture or number or somthing printed on it?<br />And I agree with japan, probably had some speeeeed in it, what with your flushes of euphoria, and no tracers, and &quot;clarity&quot;.

				What I did last night may well have been cut with speed. But I&#039;ve done enough speed to know what that feels like and there was definitely something else (actual mdma I&#039;m convinced from reading erowid and comparing to what I felt last night).<br /><br />Last night I fell asleep at exactly the hour erowid told me my roll would dissipate. It followed their little effects graph to the tee.<br /><br />The euphoria flushes weren&#039;t from last night, that&#039;s what I got from the college stuff, and what I&#039;m seeking to try again. Although, there were no tracers with the college stuff. College stuff definitely was not 100% speed either.<br /><br />The tracers and clarity were from the stuff I did last night. the college stuff also had the clarity involved but I was too busy having orgasm sensations all over my body to really notice it like I did last night. When I say clarity I mean it like a crisp mindedness. Not just well organized thoughts. Its hard to describe.

				Hmm...MDA because of the tracers?<br />Did you get any visuals? Like a research psychedelic may give? (Like 2cb)

				So far the only RC I&#039;ve tried is 2c-p (yea, shitty first rc to try), but that didn&#039;t really give me visuals. To be honest, even a 250 ug acid trip only gives me tracers at the most though.<br /><br />Oh and by the way the pill I did in college was a little elongated for anal insertion, no marking. Didn&#039;t look pharmaceutical to me. It was bright browish almost red in color.<br /><br />The tracers came from the substance I tried last night. So perhaps that could have actually been mda, and the stuff I did in college was mdma? Hmm... that would suck because it would mean the vendor got screwed, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case cause the vendor seems to also be close to some pretty good L.

				MDMA has a different flavor of euphoria to me than that of an orgasm.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what drug you took, but that&#039;s my .02cents.

				Genghar, agreed.<br /><br />Last night was much different from the drug I took in college. I think it was real mdma.<br /><br />But I want the full body orgasm I felt in college.<br /><br />What drug can be pressed in a pill, is sold as ecstasy, and gives that particular full body orgasm style, and lasts a few hours longer than mdma?

				Possibly Speed with MDE??? I think I did MDE once, was very clean feeling and I actually was able to sleep pretty soon after the roll was over. This was close to 10 years ago when A: more MDE was around and B: &quot;Molly&quot; was just starting to become popular.

				You probably took MDMA in college. The first experience with MDMA is always the best. For some people it loses much of its magic after the first experience.<br /><br />The first five times I took MDMA, it gave me an orgasmic euphoria throughout my whole body. Now it feels different.

				Maybe the drug you took in college was mephdrone (4-mmc) at least that&#039;s what the euphoria and other effects you described sounded like to me.<br />It has been around the drug scene since about 2007 (although it was first synthed in 1929 and was &quot;rediscovered&quot; in 2003.......kinda like MDMA&#039;s history) and It has been used as a &quot;replacement&quot; for MDMA in a lot of pills. So it is definitely possible. Especially in college where theres always at least one &quot;smart kid&quot; that buys legal research chems online like that to sell as other shit.<br /><br />As for the mild visuals that you described from your recent report. I figured that I would mention that MDMA can become visual in high enough doses, due to one of its tertiary metabolic pathways converting it into MDA in the body. This only happens at high enough doses to flood the primary metabolic pathway though (but keep in mind that everyone has different natural enzyme levels). but I have had it happen to me from a single bean (200mg mdma) from holland in the past.

				Gonzo,<br /><br />That makes sense because I did end up doing a little more of a dose than I meant to. (guessing like 170-180, yea I know, you live you learn).<br /><br />Do you think the dose difference might have made up for the difference in body buzz? <br /><br />Also I&#039;ve snorted Limetless&#039; mephedrone and didn&#039;t get that kinda body buzz, but it could have been that I was snorting lower doses instead of eating it.

				Yea, 170 to 180 is just a little on the high side for someone that doesn&#039;t do it all the time. And it could casue those effects. As for snorting mephedrone. I think the euphoria is much, much,&nbsp; more apparent if you bomb your dose all at once rather than snorting bumps here and there. snorting it like that just makes it a good stimulant.<br /><br />And IMHO.&nbsp; you can get too much euphoria from it. One Time I felt so good that it started to turn bad like I had serotonin syndrome.
