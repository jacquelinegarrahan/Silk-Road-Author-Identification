				It may depend on where you are and where you fly to. In the US,&nbsp; almost every airport that I know of has either the magnatron or the back scatter xray machines. These imaging devices are really good at seeing everything down to the skin level. Even tissue in your pocket will inspire a nice friendly frisk as if you were dating the nice TSA officer. Busty women and certain bra types are hard to view via this method so they frequently get pulled for extra security measures.&nbsp; &nbsp;Secret pocket is totally not working in this scenario.&nbsp; I have breezed security often only to find the randomly traveling and very thorough dogs. There is currently as far as i know no requirement to submit to a body cavity search unless it is international travel. In that case anything is possible you have no rights.&nbsp; Checked bags are always xrayed and very often randomly searched as well the dogs. Plus the random baggage handler looking for cameras to steal or other items that catch their fancy. Locking your luggage is out unless it is TSA operable or that simply inspires them to cut the lock off to check it for fun.&nbsp; I like herbal supplements myself and of course now docors love to tell you to take niacin or other such capsule suppliments. This offer some chance of mxing in descretely if you are lucky to catch a lazy TSA crew.<br /><br />Random thoughts as a someone who finds the joy of flying long gone.<br /><br />Hilly

				I once swallowed about 14 grams of black hashish. Never done this before and would NEVER do this with any amount of drugs that could kill you.<br /><br />What came out smelt like shit - it was awful but maybe I never done it right.<br /><br />I was so stoned on the plane that evenif the bag would have burst I would have just listened to more music maybe. Its only pot - I&#039;d enjoy it if one burst but would not like to go to the USA stoned on one ounce of top drawer hash. TSA would be putting on the gloves just looking at my red eyes.<br /><br />If a condom of 28 grams of coke burst - it would be ok if it was UK street coke - you&#039;d have a numb stomach for a while. Seriously though - imagine sitting back on the flight and feeling that distinctive start of a coke high as a condom burst! You could not sit back and enjoy that high. Pot - at worse you fall asleep. Eat the actual food on the plane and like it.<br /><br />Since then I usually stick it down my bollocks - nice and snugly.<br /><br />But with these x-ray scanner who knows?<br /><br />A friend always just puts it were the sun do not shine.<br /><br />Risking your girlfriend is not a very nice thing to do! I&#039;m lucky as my stash is safe with my women and she don&#039;t mind me getting a little bit funky.

				No matter what you do it&#039;s going to be difficult to take drugs on a commercial flight. If you have the money I would suggest using a private jet. (Not feasible for some I know)

				Small balloons, tie them up nice and swallow...gotta get dirty to reclaim them though.<br />If you are a woman, empty a powder foundation and replace the powder, then store it in your make up bag... Won&#039;t work if the dogs are there<br />In a small balloon, dropped in a small bottle of baby powder<br /><br />Best way I know, is to not even bring it on the plane, just mail it to your hotel

				I&#039;ve taken small personal amounts (under 1 gram) of various powders and herbs in through in my bags. Maybe it&#039;s all the other stuff and garbage in my bags that hide it, but I&#039;ve never had it searched. Or maybe I&#039;m just lucky. At first I only brought legal stuff and pieces with me, but I never got searched so I started bringing other things instead of mailing them. Anyone have similar experiences?

				I wonder about how frequent some of you fly.<br />The best way I&#039;ve heard is send it ahead of you via mail.<br /><br />I can&#039;t tell you all my secrets but getting through with small amounts of drugs, is nerve&nbsp; racking but easy.<br />The basic concept is TSA bumps into drugs.<br />Don&#039;t try to hide in a false bottom object or your body.<br />Never in your luggage. None of you body holes either.<br />Have it accessible to ditch if things look out of place.<br />I&#039;ve done body searches, and full searches. I even handed my weed over to the TSA agent to hold, while they checked me.<br />Think outside the box, don&#039;t hide.<br />For x-ray density likeness hides things.

How ever if it&#039;s wrapped in a snot rag, how would you handled it?<br />Think......<br />Full body search. I don&#039;t trust x-rays, and back scanners.<br />I&#039;m not telling you exactly how, but there are ways. <br />They aren&#039;t looking for drugs, they are looking for weapons, and bomb parts.<br />They bumped into drugs, and are required to report it.<br />I don&#039;t even think hand copping will work, but who knows.<br />I&#039;ll bet you could put a joint on your ear, and they would miss it.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />All you need to know it&#039;s being done everyday on every flight ;)<br /><br />

				If it&#039;s powder or marijuana, buy a cigarette roller with cigarette tubes and just stuff the empty fags with the powder or weed. Then just stuff the fake cigs in an empty pack of Marlboro&#039;s and it&#039;s as easy as that. Depending on the substance used they look no different than regular cigarettes as long ass you put them with the filters facing up.<br /><br />This also makes it easy to snort them later if you&#039;re into that. ;)

They only have metal detectors which is almost too easy to sneak drugs past. There aren&#039;t even any dog&#039;s at the airport, can you believe it! So if you really want to smuggle drugs, it might be worth taking the extra drive to a smaller airport like mine. The security it ridiculously lax! ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve taken different quantities of mushrooms, marijuana, prescription pills, tabs of 25i-NBOMe and LSD (wrapped in tinfoil even), and accidentally left a large amount of molly in my wallet which even went through the x-ray. Hell, the first time I bought DMT was right outside the terminal parked behind a cop. The cop even came by to tell us to move along, with the amber vial of DMT clearly in the driver&#039;s hand as he was informing me on how to smoke it. It scared me shit-less but the cop didn&#039;t even notice and we moved along just like that. :P

				I smuggled some speed and extasy into an asian country (by airplane) . I hid it in the battery-slot of a gilette razor (for wet shaving, the one that vibrates). Not much space though, but very safe because its surrounded by metal and no cop or security looks in there. The razor was of course in the suitcase, not the hand baggage.<br /><br />@Gary Oak<br /><br />omg, cool story, bro!^^
