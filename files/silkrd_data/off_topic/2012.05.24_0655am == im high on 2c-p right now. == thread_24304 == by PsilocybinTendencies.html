				I just took what was most likely somewhere between 10mg and 14 mg of 2c-p, and I&#039;m still not sure if I like this drug or not. Its definitely potent, but this is the first substance that&#039;s this strong that I&#039;ve had that I&#039;m kind of on the fence about.

				2C-P is more fun/recreational at 6-8mg. Strange that you&#039;re not getting much visuals. About mood swings - when I took 10-11mg. of it I felt like a teenage girl having pms or something like that - very emotional, constant mood changes, horny one second, sad another. Oh, and comedown takes ages. I usually can sleep only 20-24 hours after taking good dose of 2C-P..

I just love to dive in to shit headfirst. I think my experience last night was a nice solid reminder that drugs are potent... and should be RESPECTED.<br /><br />I don&#039;t understand my inability to get visuals... at my peak, I was getting slight hints that I maybe wanted to hallucinate, if I tried really hard.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing... I didn&#039;t get any visuals off a 2 hit 3Jane acid trip with one hit ingested later to prolong effects, either (and everyone on here, and my brother-in-law irl, says they did). So... idk. That kind sucks... but at least I feel the hallucinogens.<br /><br />My mother on the other hand, also ate two hits of 3Jane&#039;s shit that night, and said she didn&#039;t really feel it that much. She dosed the same amount of 2C-P as I did tonight, and to my complete fucking amazement, she sat there watching her Charmed like it was nothing, then proceeded to go to sleep while I was peaking.<br /><br />Perhaps some people just have a huge natural tolerance to hallucinogens, and maybe I simply inherited the anti-visual gene.<br /><br />Idk... but enough bitching about that, back to the 2C-P.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m enjoying the come down off this drug more than I liked the actual trip itself. In fact, I didn&#039;t much care for the trip itself I think.<br /><br />I can relate to what the quoted poster said about analyzing everything, even the bad things. In a funny way, I feel like I&#039;d recommend this drug to someone who intentionally wants to invoke a bad trip for the learning experience it provides. For a long time, I really wasn&#039;t enjoying myself, but it wasn&#039;t in an &quot;OMFG EGO DEATH WTF IS HAPPENING TO ME BLACK HOLE&quot; kinda way, it was in a &quot;it&#039;s kind of inconvenient for me to still be tripping, wish I could sleep&quot; kind of way. I had a bad acid trip on four hits once (I got visuals from THAT&#039; so it&#039;s at least possible), a long time ago, and while I might class four of my hours last night as &quot;bad trip,&quot; it was in a much more manageable way than that term implies. <br /><br />For fifteen minutes I&#039;d be uncomfortable in my own skin, wishing I was able to sleep, then for fifteen minutes I&#039;d get the MDMA like euphoric body buzz I crave so badly, then back to discomfort. For a while there I was laying alone in my bed in the dark curled up in a ball thinking &quot;well, I&#039;m clearly going to survive this, but this still kind of sucks in its own way.&quot;<br /><br />Do I regret taking it? Do I feel justified by the experience I had as an attempt at recreation? Well I&#039;m starting to come down, and I&#039;m STILL not sure...<br /><br />I think I may actually be neutral about this drug. Overall it wasn&#039;t a bad time, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be something I&#039;ll seek out again.<br /><br />The come down buzz feels really good. In some ways comparable to the few opiate highs I&#039;ve had. My uncle finally walked in at 5:30 in the fucking morning with a bowlpack like a saving grace sent directly by god. For a few hours after that I actually felt really good.<br /><br />If you choose to do this drug, I HIGHLY recommend abstaining until you have pot on hand the whole time.<br /><br />Masturbation was wicked on this drug. Prolonged, but ever more pleasurable, there was certain disconnect between my penis and my hand and I was holding the bliss separately from myself.<br /><br />On the other hand, some unexpected business I have to go take care of cropped up today, and I&#039;m trying to work up the balls to meander out into the general public and talk to people. Ugh.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure what else to say. I guess my recommendation would be to avoid 2C-P for recreation, and if you&#039;re going to use it, be an experienced psychonaut, and be ready for a more introspective trip where you sort out your feelings.<br /><br />

I also find it to slightly intensify the visuals.<br />And yeah, masturbating on 2C-P is crazy. I&#039;d even go so far as to say that I&#039;ve had the best orgasms of my life on 2C-P. It feels totally different from masturbating on drugs like 4-MEC and Methylone.

				Alrighty guys,<br /><br />I got the day off tomorrow, and ain&#039;t got no better drugs, had a little bit of this leftover so I said fuck it.<br /><br />2c-p attempt #2 initiated.<br /><br />This time I just eyeballed me a small dose. I was shooting for about half my first dose so hopefully I guessed about 5mg but god only knows how much I really took. This was a couple hours ago so effects should be settling in any time now.
