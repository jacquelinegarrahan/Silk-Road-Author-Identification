				Don&#039;t have to post actual geographical locations this would lower your anonymity.<br /><br /><br />Just thought this was a good question maybe not I don&#039;t know.<br /><br /><br />Anyway the best place I have smoked a joint was with the last bit of white widow I won from Anarcho47&#039;s lotto, I smoked it in the bath with candles the lot thought it was a pretty awesome idea.

				Under the open sky! <br />There is certainly something to be said about stoned stargazing. As I would stare at the stars, I would consider the possibility of alien life. I would wonder if those aliens would get high (space-buds!) and puzzle at the stars as I did. And I would guess, that looking at the same stars I was, they were thinking pretty similar thoughts.<br />-sSh-

				Me and my friend are a big fan of climbing buildings and smoking as sort of a &quot;aha we did it&quot; kind of thing. We have smoked in many abandon buildings and on roofs of strip malls and such. Also up in high trees, on top of parked trucks at night outside of bars, and we even break into abandon trains and hot box them. I get a thrill from this shit for some reason.

				True story : I&#039;m sitting at a friends house blazing when we hear a knock at the door. One of those &quot;open up its the cops&quot; type knock. I knew my buddy knew a cop but didn&#039;t think anything of it. Sure enough a hugh fucking cop in full uniform walks in! Needless to say I&#039;m tripping as this is too weird. My buddy tells the cop were smoking hash! Wtf. Then offers him some food he cooked earlier. Cop sits down two feet away (surprised I was even there in the first place) eats his food, gets up and leaves. I didnt dare smoke the whole time he was there....out of respect or maybe getting arrested. Although I knew he was the buddies friend and that wouldn&#039;t happen.&nbsp; He left eventually and I&#039;m just like....did that just really fucking happen! Crazy ass true story.
