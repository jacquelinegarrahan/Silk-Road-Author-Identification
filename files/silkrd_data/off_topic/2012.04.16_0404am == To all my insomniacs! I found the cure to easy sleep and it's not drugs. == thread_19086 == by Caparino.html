				I&#039;ve been a self-diagnosed insomniac for ages now. I thought drugs had fuck my brain and I could no longer control my sleep. Last week I went to my local walmart and found the cure for 5 bucks... a fucking blindfold and some ear plugs. I put these guys on and within 20 minutes I&#039;m guaranteed asleep. This has been tested for the past week and it works every time. You thank me later&nbsp; :D

The more you take, the less your own brain creates to balance it out. Result: melatonin starved brain throughout your day. It has other functions when you&#039;re conscious too

				I always liked warm milk, counting sheep, and a good bedtime story.<br /><br />Of course I&#039;m not 5 years old anymore, but old habits die hard ;)<br /><br />And lucid dreaming, people have to try that at least once in their life, talk about tripping. Dream control- the ultimate trip.<br /><br />Just ummm be sure to change your bedsheets afterwards... if you catch my drift :P

				i discovered this a while back. the eye mask and ear plugs really allow me to have a restful sleep. ive tried several eye masks most of them served their purpose but none were really that good. <br /><br />i recently bought the &quot;glo to sleep&quot; mask. its a bit pricey but it works. its comfortable, allows you to open your eyes, and blocks out all light.<br /><br />

I have tried everything to help me to sleep and whilst natural herbal stuff does help me get off to sleep, I tend to wake up in middle of night or too early in morning.<br /><br />I have found the only thing which works very well to regulate my sleep cycle is Etizolam. It&#039;s a benzo analog and easy/cheap to get hold of....works better than benzos. I only need to take 0.5mg and I&#039;m out like a light in 30 mins and have 7 hours quality sleep. Also get nice dreams on it as an added bonus =)<br /><br />Been taking it for months and haven&#039;t experienced any tolerance or withdrawal on days when I don&#039;t take it.<br /><br />

				I got over sleep issues by realizing its ok to be awake.&nbsp; Never bothers me anymore, I just sleep when I&#039;m sleepy and stay awake when I feel like it.

I&#039;ve lived for prolonged time periods without a circadian rhythm and I feel its made me psychologically stronger. Also I love speed.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Self-rationalization. I guess it could work along with speed.<br /><br />After a year of amphetamine use though, I got too schizotypal and had to get off the stuff. 5 months later and my brain power still isn&#039;t what it used to be before speed -__-

I&#039;m not sure, but I think my amphetamine use may have permanently made me dumber.<br /><br />I actually like it better this way though. I get laid a little bit more often than I used to, I went from rarely getting any to getting laid once in a great while. Considering turning it down a couple more notches.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, but for what man? Living a simple enough life where we&#039;re too tempted by our own sexual gratifications? I wanna see where my potential takes me. I&#039;ve been working out, meditating, and eating right ever since I got off. It&#039;s been 4 months now but I&#039;m starting to see real progress thanks to some additional help from lucy :)
