				Just for those newbs who aren&#039;t aware of the background to all this terminology and what it is all about.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The cypherpunks (Cypherpunk Mailing List, Tor Project, Wikileaks, even humble PGP Club) and cryptoanarchists (Silk Road, Defense Distributed) are closely related. Common economic protocols on the network like BitTorrent, Bitcoin, the new BitMessage and so forth are also connected.<br /><br />The objective of the cypherpunks is to achieve political objectives by the use of computer code involving cryptography. Wikipedia says: A<br />cypherpunk is an activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography as a route to social and political change.<br /><br />The objective of the cryptoanarchists is, as Wikipedia describes, employing cryptography to enable individuals to make consensual economic arrangements and to transcend national boundaries.<br /><br />Both concepts are strongly associated with an older ideology called Agorism, which is DPR&#039;s philosophy.<br /><br />And of course Wikipedia itself is a creation which is strongly linked to cryptoanarchist ideas. Incidentally, one of the key principals is that you don&#039;t have to &quot;sign up&quot; on the concepts of cryptoanarchy or cipherpunk at all. It&#039;s enough that your behavior is modified by use of various protocols. Although for some cipherpunks democracy is important, a cryptoanarchist would be highly unlikely to believe in it, so there is some differences between the groups.<br /><br />The Silk Road is the latest incarnation of an Internet based political movement, not merely another ecommerce solution. That is why I would recommend staff or anybody on this forum who sees fit, to request the status of political prisoners if they are captured. If BTC is banned, then the Bitcoin community ought to do the same.<br /><br />If you allow the judicial system to castigate you as merely &quot;some drug dealer&quot; or &quot;another vigilante hacker&quot;, then you&#039;re allowing a particular political viewpoint dominate you, you&#039;re accepting their label for you. There is power in names on the internet in a way that doesn&#039;t exist offline, it is important to refuse to accept the State nyms. We have our own society, our own culture, our own way of thinking about the world, and it smacks of incredible arrogance for a political system to claim us as their own merely because we were born in a specific geographical location. I feel no alliance with my country or any other whatsoever. <br /><br />It is STRONGLY in the&nbsp; interests of young people to join the ranks of the cypherpunks and cryptoanarchists. I cannot emphasize that enough. The sooner they fully comprehend there is nothing but a black hole waiting for them where jobs used to exist, the better. Cooperating with the government is hazardous to their wealth and health. It is not like what it was for their parents and grandparents and there is no way for them to influence the political sphere via traditional routes. Honestly I think that unless this generation realizes this, they&#039;re fucked.<br />

				Well, i&#039;m not sure this is DPR, but i&#039;m glad you found this guy either way...&nbsp; an interesting read/watch/listen to say the least. <br /><br />If it is DPR - slap on the wrist for doing so much tweeting while we were roadless.. haha. <br /><br />Out of interest - whats everyones opinion on the gun printing? I half feel interested and liberated, but pretty unsure about it at the same time. Maybe i&#039;m old fashioned but i&#039;m glad SR/The Armory stopped selling guns. And i&#039;d be glad if people couldnt 3D print them too... Why can&#039;t people go back to good old fashioned stone throwing....

Thank you for another informative and intelligent pine post.<br /><br />Oh, and it&#039;s in the interests of older people too. I am glad that this form of anarchy is now open to those of us who aren&#039;t as computer literate as we would like to be. When I was a kid there was no such thing as a home computer. Now I can do a little research, learn a little like PGP etc and now I am participating in this great subculture. <br /><br /><br />To the OP - I was watching the Vice program on Cody the other day and he blew me away with his confidence and point of view. I think his marketing of printable lower receivers and magazines is GENIUS and definitely the way forward. The powers that be must be freaking out.<br />To people who don&#039;t like guns... it&#039;s too late. Gun control would be like trying to eradicate bicycles. The technology and the ability to use it is already out there. I don&#039;t like guns much.<br /><br />Is Cody DPR?&nbsp; A very strong candidate. I now have to google&nbsp; Satoshi Nakamoto&nbsp; ???

				Cody Wilson is not DPR.<br /><br />There are two personality types: open and closed. DPR is a secretive type, whereas Cody Wilson wants to be in the spotlight: he&#039;s public about everything he does, does interviews, and has his picture in magazines. DPR is not like this.<br /><br />That is the difference.

				I have been thinking about this thread and I reckon that DPR is an older person than Cody Wilson.<br /><br />Of course this is all just for fun and I doubt anyone here is trying to actually find DPR.<br /><br />It may just be the way s/he writes but s/he comes across as an older soul. Of course you can be 24 and have an old soul but yannow what I mean.<br /><br />I would imagine that DPR keeps their head firmly under the radar. Having such a high profile would be incredibly risky. Not impossible though. Just look at the most successful spys and double agents. Many living the majority of their lives as two people, and never the twain shall meet.<br /><br />

I am an avid austrian economics student, anarchocapitalist, agorist and voluntaryist, and I have been at the fringes of the cypherpunk scene since the late 90s. I want 3d printed guns too, and if I had the money, I&#039;d already be working on it. I&#039;ve always wanted to design my own gun down to the last detail. Specifically a dual purpose assault rifle with a 12 gauge shotgun under it with a short barrel and 7 round bottom-fed tube mag behind it. Also a pistol with a geometry that defeats recoil up-tip something somewhat similar to that TDI vector smg, or maybe more like that pistol someone developed for old people with weak hands. I am also dreaming up a peer to peer contract/reputation system that is built upon a non-exiting onion/rendezvous router system that will essentially make all bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin based marketplaces (anonymous and publicly open) obsolete. <br /><br />There is a lot of us types out there in the world. We are all converging on our target of liberating, at least our kind of people, from the oppression of governments and bullies and trolls. The pace is picking up, I never could have imagined that there would be a fully operational and effective drug marketplace in operation already without pervasive gigabit fibre internet already online.<br /><br />Anyway, very cool stuff. The sooner a reliable, 3d printer/cnc machined gun design is made the better. The war on drugs is all over bar the shouting now, and pretty soon so will the war on guns.<br /><br />edit: oh, i just read through that post someone quoted just above me. I wasn&#039;t aware that &#039;cypherpunks&#039; believed in democracy... or at least, that the ideas they had were more like using cryptography and internet to enable &#039;direct democracy&#039;. To my mind after having read a lot of austrian/anarchocapitalist writings, it&#039;s not really democracy if we are directly involved individually, because, a little known fact, the word &#039;demos&#039;, the root of democracy, is plural, it does not refer to the individual, and not only that, democracy always devolves to might makes right rule of the mob... Cypherpunks are more individualist, if they are on the left side of the spectrum it is post-left like lamborn-wilson (hakim bey) and other similar writers (guy debord, raoul vaneigem). Those only-just socialist philosophies are so close to individualist right-anarchist (I personally consider it centrist, if anything) commonly called &#039;agorists&#039;, &#039;anarchocapitalists&#039; and &#039;voluntaryists&#039; really don&#039;t have a lot of differences between them anyway. <br /><br />The whole thing is converging anyway. Cryptography and network-based systems enable the realisation of the dreams of both sides of the spectrum, but prove that in practise the real answers lie right in the middle, right on the edge opposite authoritarianism. A lot of haters like to castigate libertarian leaning people as being unrealistic and idealistic, but I think that is a bit of a joke when you consider how utterly impossible and unstable both socialist and fascist systems are and have proven to be over and over again in the last 200 years.

				knowing how to program computers is one thing, sure, a 22 year old could do that, even a 16 year old, in some cases. but knowing enough about the anon drug market and knowing enough of the right people to promote it and get it up and running... i first met &#039;drugs in the post&#039; people about 5 years ago. one loon who was cooking meth and ghb, last i heard of him he took too much meth and idk what else and ended up being arrested for acting like a nutcase outside his house or something. he used to send out drugs in the mail. he was about 22 at the time. so if DPR was one of his contemporaries then he/she would be late 20s by now.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=155044.msg1083132#msg1083132">Quote from: pine on May 03, 2013, 05:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just for those newbs who aren&#039;t aware of the background to all this terminology and what it is all about.<br /><br />--<br /><br />The cypherpunks (Cypherpunk Mailing List, Tor Project, Wikileaks, even humble PGP Club) and cryptoanarchists (Silk Road, Defense Distributed) are closely related. Common economic protocols on the network like BitTorrent, Bitcoin, the new BitMessage and so forth are also connected.<br /><br />The objective of the cypherpunks is to achieve political objectives by the use of computer code involving cryptography. Wikipedia says: A<br />cypherpunk is an activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography as a route to social and political change.<br /><br />The objective of the cryptoanarchists is, as Wikipedia describes, employing cryptography to enable individuals to make consensual economic arrangements and to transcend national boundaries.<br /><br />Both concepts are strongly associated with an older ideology called Agorism, which is DPR&#039;s philosophy.<br /><br />And of course Wikipedia itself is a creation which is strongly linked to cryptoanarchist ideas. Incidentally, one of the key principals is that you don&#039;t have to &quot;sign up&quot; on the concepts of cryptoanarchy or cipherpunk at all. It&#039;s enough that your behavior is modified by use of various protocols. Although for some cipherpunks democracy is important, a cryptoanarchist would be highly unlikely to believe in it, so there is some differences between the groups.<br /><br />The Silk Road is the latest incarnation of an Internet based political movement, not merely another ecommerce solution. That is why I would recommend staff or anybody on this forum who sees fit, to request the status of political prisoners if they are captured. If BTC is banned, then the Bitcoin community ought to do the same.<br /><br />If you allow the judicial system to castigate you as merely &quot;some drug dealer&quot; or &quot;another vigilante hacker&quot;, then you&#039;re allowing a particular political viewpoint dominate you, you&#039;re accepting their label for you. There is power in names on the internet in a way that doesn&#039;t exist offline, it is important to refuse to accept the State nyms. We have our own society, our own culture, our own way of thinking about the world, and it smacks of incredible arrogance for a political system to claim us as their own merely because we were born in a specific geographical location. I feel no alliance with my country or any other whatsoever. <br /><br />It is STRONGLY in the&nbsp; interests of young people to join the ranks of the cypherpunks and cryptoanarchists. I cannot emphasize that enough. The sooner they fully comprehend there is nothing but a black hole waiting for them where jobs used to exist, the better. Cooperating with the government is hazardous to their wealth and health. It is not like what it was for their parents and grandparents and there is no way for them to influence the political sphere via traditional routes. Honestly I think that unless this generation realizes this, they&#039;re fucked.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Trying to see the forest behind the tree, and I feel I am without a map.

GG government.<br /><br />now.. just go invest 1400 in a 3d printer, download his file, buy the upper(already built) chamber of an ar-15...<br />then print your lower receiver.. print some 100 round clips...<br />and you have yourself an army... it&#039;s not hard for a brain to operate passed or through its walls...<br /><br />just give us time.. we&#039;ll break through. :)<br /><br />@Shroomeister.. we all know DPR is Satoshi Nakamoto.. ;) i believe we&#039;ve discussed this before!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />/thumbs
