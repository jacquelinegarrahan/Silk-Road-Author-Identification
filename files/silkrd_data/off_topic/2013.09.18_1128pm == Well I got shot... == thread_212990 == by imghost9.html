				Yep.... Thought It would never happen to me. <br /><br />Without giving away to many details I took a 9mm point blank range to the neck and out the back of my skull.... I recently just got out of the trauma unit and was told when I first arrived I had a 1/10 chance of surviving. Well 5 weeks later and I survived! I&#039;m In excrutiating pain, can&#039;t move my neck, have no Insurance, and my dick doesn&#039;t work the same but I&#039;m lucky to be alive <br /><br />To all you dealers/potential dealers be careful. Selling Is addictive and It&#039;s easy to get a big head and feel untouchable when your making tax free money. I got cocky pissed some people off and almost paid for It with my life. For a minute I was feelin on top of the world, I could eat wherever I want, could take my girls shoppin at the mall, could pay my bills no problem, bought my kid all sorts of neat shit. The next minute I&#039;m layin on my back In ICU with a feeding tube and catheder after losing EVERYTHING I&#039;ve worked for.<br /><br />I made this because I&#039;m stuck at home till God knows when.&nbsp; It&#039;s gonna be a long painful recovery so I&#039;ll probally be hangin around the forums alot more then usual. If you guys have any questions feel free to ask. My personal favorite &quot;did It hurt?&quot;

Now you&#039;re alive and you get to come back and kill the people who shot you. I mean if your dick kind of works ok then I&#039;d say like live life and stuff. But no. If my dick was all fucked up and you shoot me and I live I&#039;m going to murder kill you. You need to watch that movie Taken. You are now that guy. On a scale of 1/10 how fucked up is your dick? How can you be positive your dick works correctly in such a strange environment? Have you been masturbating with an exit wound in the back of your head like the size of a plum? <br /><br />Unless that was a FMJ 9 mm and not a jacketed hollow point there is no way you should be alive.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;d say a 5/10. I haven&#039;t had a full erection since the shooting and couldn&#039;t get It up today when I was really countin on him .... FUCKIN EMBARASSING <br /><br />I think most of It&#039;s mental to be honest as the doctor did not mention anything about my nether region bein fucked up.&nbsp; I figure the 24/7 migraine/neck pain/stiffness may have something to do with It as well as I can&#039;t afford my medicine. I&#039;m really praying to God It&#039;s 1 of the 2<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				It was definetly a set up all leading back to a BITCH. I&#039;m slowly learning more. But women can and will cloud your judgement and make you do STUPID things. I learned my lesson<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately I sold my xbox months ago so no GTA V for me :(

				Freaking wow imghost9!! Good thing you are alive though! <br /><br />As for your dick, well considering you are on a recovery phase it might take you some time. I really feel your anxiety. My dick is above all as well and would really hate not seeing it working 100%. But I believe it should come back to normal soon.<br /><br />And because you allowed us to ask questions let me bomb you with some :) <br />First of all your own question. Did it hurt? (If you can remember)<br />Many talk about the release of DMT during a near death experience. Can you recall anything that proves this theory? :)<br />So you escaped death. Good job my friend! But did thisincident expose your drug activities in any way that it will hurt you? I mean legally.<br /><br />And last question, kind of philosophical. <br />Will you take revenge, or just let the past behind and enjoy the &quot;second chance&quot;?<br />If I may interfere at this point, I would say yes to revenge only in case the person who tried to kill you wants you dead and will try to do so . If not, I would say that you try forget it. As you say, have a kid. You escaped death, it would be silly to spend your time in jail. <br /><br />Again, shocking story! Glad we have the opportunity to read that you are alive!! I don&#039;t know you, but I mean it..<br /><br />All the best my friend!<br />Good luck with your dick as well!!<br /><br />Adamiz

I&#039;m not sure If you&#039;ve ever played the video game Call of duty but right before you die In the game your vision goes black and white, there&#039;s some visual distortions, everything kinda slows down and there&#039;s this loud endless ringing In your ears. As stupid as It sounds getting shot was almost EXACTLY like this. Imagine this on top of gettin rocked In the head with a baseball bat, and that&#039;s the best example I can give of how Ii felt.<br /><br />Unfortunately I&#039;ve never tripped on DMT so I can&#039;t really elaborate on this, but what I can tell you Is I had some of the realest dreams I&#039;ve had In my life. I can&#039;t really even describe It but the entire time I was In the hospital I was lucid dreaming (not sure If this was due to the medication) about everyday life. It got so crazy I came up with this theory that when we go to sleep and dream we&#039;re actually going to our &quot;other life&quot; In a different dimension and when we go to sleep In this other dimension we wake up and live our everyday normal lives. <br /><br />Not sure If that makes any sense but I don&#039;t know any other way to put It lol It was somethin else. Hope that answered some questions
