				Last spring I remember hearing about a &quot;zombie drug&quot; which made one person eat another person. I think you all heard about it. The drug this person might have taken when he ate the other person seems to be &quot;bath salts&quot; aka MDPV. <br /><br />1. Does anyone know if he actually had taken MDPV or some other drug?<br />2. Does this drug make you want to eat people etc if you are otherwise healthy (no psychiatric disease)?<br />3. Are there any drugs that to your knowledge turn people into primitive beasts?<br />4. What do you think actually made this person eat the other person (drugs or whatever else)?

				Okay, thank you! When you mention PCP I remember that I heard that PCP is the drug he was on, but apparently not that either since the autopsy proved differently.

				Although I have never been lucky enough to get any and try it, I hear that PCP is similar to a multi hour K-hole.

The video showed him even getting shot by the cops and not falling over.<br /><br />

I was in my house hearing cops voices and people pulling into the drive way, ofc nothing was ever there and it took about 2 hours for it to go away. Not a fun drug wouldn&#039;t do it again.
