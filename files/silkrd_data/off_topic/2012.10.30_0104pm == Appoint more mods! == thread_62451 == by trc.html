				It would be great if a few mods in different time zones were selected, forums have been spammed so much in the last 1-2months. Right now I only know of one forum mode and an entire board is a bit much for them to handle I think.

				More moderation is not needed. What is needed is spam busters who are actually online.

				I can imagine the forum management doesn&#039;t want to appoint too many moderators, because that would make it easy for the wrong people to infiltrate.<br /><br />If this is technically possible, here is what I&#039;d do:<br /><br />Assign a few &quot;Spam Busters&quot; and create a hidden subforum. The Spam Busters are like moderators, but the only power the have is that they can move threads. Spam busters move all the spam threads to the hidden subforum invisible for the public.<br /><br />Then every once in a while, the real trusted moderators can check the hidden subforum to see if only spam threads got moved, and that nobody in the newly appointed spam buster team has abused his powers.<br /><br />Also, if possible, I&#039;d configure the forum in such a way that any thread/post (by a member with less than 200 posts) that contains the word &quot;btkoin.com&quot; (the scam website) is automatically blocked.

				Other thing that might work: restrict new users from posting more threads with the same title. Not impossible to circumvent, but it would make automated spamming a bit harder.

				There is a clear line between moderators and spam busters...moderators are covered.....spam busters are not.<br />NO mods need to be appointed.<br />If you don&#039;t know the difference in the moderators and the spam busters don&#039;t make stupid threads like appoint more mods.
