				Feel like talking about your current trip/buzz/high?&nbsp; Here&#039;s your thread.<br /><br />I&#039;m on some over the counter liquid codeine, about 500mg, and 3 10/ 325mg percocets.&nbsp; Pretty solid buzz, get the occasional nod.&nbsp; Mix this with some mellow indie music, and I&#039;m having a great ol&#039; time.

				Right know *just* on some good Speed from MrFire that keeps me smiling at my work and later maybe on some Valoron/Tilidin, not really because of the high, <br />more to relax my stupid back pains.<br /><br />IÂ´m buzzing a little slower the next days - waiting for some Shivas from albion and MDMA from Afterhour and will turn on when it arrives :)

				Took 60mg of an 80mg Oxycontin OP (low-moderate opiate tolerance atm) that I received today from OxycontinKing. Crazy awesome vendor btw, and just took some bumps of pentedrone. I&#039;m really surprised at its synergistic effects. The highs combine instead of one overriding the other. Feeling pretty good&nbsp; 8)

				Right now - xanax, valium, pollen and a pint of weissbeer - pretty fucking chilled as far as things go<br /><br />As to mixing 25i and mdma - go for it, but take the 25i first or the molly will mask the come up.&nbsp; Is the 25i in caps (up in 15 mins or so snorted) or tabs (20mins-1hr sublingually)? - overall buzz shouldn&#039;t be too different, but eg. Tyl3r&#039;s caps (particularly combo caps) will knock your fucking socks off, whereas with tabs it&#039;s that creeper &#039;is something happening? yep I&#039;m sure something&#039;s happening&#039; then you stare at your hand for 10 mins just to make sure
