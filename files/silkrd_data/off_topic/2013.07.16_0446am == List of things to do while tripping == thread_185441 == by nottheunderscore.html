				Some great things to do while tripping…can you add to this?<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Go for a walk or go hike in Nature…Especially if it is raining!!!!&nbsp; Staring at the moon can be an experience in itself.&nbsp; <br />2. Swimming in a pool, heated preferably...temperature changes feel good though.&nbsp; <br />3. Showering with a member of the opposite sex in a completely dark shower.&nbsp; (No Light whatsoever)&nbsp; It becomes like a Sensory Deprivation tank and is my favorite thing to do.&nbsp; Absolute Darkness is best, but a solitary blinking light can also be fun.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />4. Go to a Concert or Rave <br />5. Painting and Finger-Painting!&nbsp; My second favorite thing to do on a psychedelic…the amount of color that comes from each brush stroke is beautiful and almost makes you cry.&nbsp; Never have you ever seen color like this.&nbsp; Painting becomes an emotional experience on Acid and I highly recommend it.&nbsp; The paint does this disappearing, reappearing act and it is quite fun.&nbsp; <br />6.&nbsp; Smoking Hookah - blowing smoke through soap bubbles or just blowing bubbles is fun.&nbsp; When it pops a little smokes comes out and its fun to watch.<br />7.&nbsp; Massages, foot massages, Back Scratching - especially with one of those head massagers that looks like a metallic spider (they sell them in Malls, like a Ting-Ting or something)<br />8.&nbsp; Watching the Winamp Visualizer MilkDrop&nbsp; This is the best best best hands down visualizer ever!&nbsp; You haven&#039;t seen a visualizer until you&#039;ve seen this on a psychedelic.&nbsp; Trust me on this one!!!&nbsp; Download the presets by googling: bltc winamp&nbsp; <br />9. Eating fruit and Vegetables...actually taste pretty good.&nbsp; There&#039;s something very primal and rewarding about biting into a strawberry while tripping.&nbsp; Try Blueberries, Blackberries, Green Beans…Fresh juicy things taste good.&nbsp; &nbsp;Meats and Cheeses usually don’t taste so good.&nbsp; <br />10.&nbsp; Go Paint-balling on Acid...I have yet to try this but I hear it&#039;s crazy.&nbsp; Might be a little too crazy.<br />11.&nbsp; Stare in the Mirror, Stare into your eyes in one of those super magnified mirrors...watching them dilate is nuts.<br />12.&nbsp; Listening to music on expensive studio headphones.&nbsp; Sennheiser or Bose or something that wraps around your entire ear.&nbsp; Trust me, this is how music was meant to be listened to.&nbsp; <br />13.&nbsp; Have sexual intercourse (Punch anyone in the face who says otherwise...they&#039;re lying to you.&nbsp; Sex on Ex or Psychedelics is the best and is so worth it.)<br />14.&nbsp; Writing on each other or painting on each other (black-light paint perhaps)<br />15.&nbsp; Floating down a river in an inter-tube.<br />16.&nbsp; Walking on the beach barefoot, or being near the ocean.<br />17.&nbsp; Star Gazing and looking at the Stars using Google Sky Maps App on your Phone<br />18.&nbsp; Smelling extreme smells, preferably good smells...candles, incense, coffee grinds, Salt.&nbsp; <br />19.&nbsp; Smoking Weed obviously...blunts are my favorite method when tripping.&nbsp; (*Roll them before you trip)<br />20. Nitrous Oxide...really can add some trippiness to a trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s likely horrible for you, but it is quite fun.&nbsp; I’m told you can take a bong…pull a rip of weed, let it remain in the chamber while you take out the slider and put a balloon of nitrous where the weed was, then take the rip.&nbsp; Weed and nitrous at once, you drop at least 4 IQ points in one sitting but its fun.<br />21.&nbsp; Throwing Glow Sticks, buy the biggest ones you can get.<br />22.&nbsp; Ice and eating ice and then making out with someone feels quite good.&nbsp; You can also eat a bunch of ice and go down on a girl or have her go down on you.&nbsp; That’s great fun.<br />23. Go for a bi-cycle ride.<br />24. Jump on a trampoline, or Moon-Bounce (Be Careful though)<br />25. Go to an amusement park and ride the rides (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26.&nbsp; Go to a water park.&nbsp; (I don&#039;t recommend this to anyone except super experienced trippers)<br />26. Get into a hot tub or bath tub with Food Coloring and drop drops into the water and watch the dye move through the water.&nbsp; (This may stain your skin for a couple days if you put a lot of color in.)&nbsp; <br />27. Hook up a fog machine in your room and let that thing go off for a while.&nbsp; Trippy lights or a strobe will help this.&nbsp; *Fog is just cool as fuck while tripping, but be sure to unplug any fire alarms, as they will be set off.&nbsp; <br />28.&nbsp; Ask a sober sitter to drive you around town for a little bit.&nbsp; Or get a Taxi (Do not drive while tripping, it never ends well)<br />29. Vicks Inhalers are fun on ecstasy...not too sure about other psychedelics.&nbsp; I remember blowing some in my eyes sober once and it hurt so badly.&nbsp; It was not at all pleasant like when you&#039;re rolling.<br />30.&nbsp; Buy some Poi Balls off of a website.&nbsp; They are like 10$ each or so...totally worth it.&nbsp; They are likely LED but swinging them around is fun and makes for amazing light shows.&nbsp; Also hula hooping is fun.<br />31.&nbsp; Go to a planetarium or laser show (Pink Floyd Laser Light show is ideal)&nbsp; Check your local IMAX or Mosi Science Theater<br />32.&nbsp; Play an instrument...or play with laser pointers, legos or clay if you have no musical talents.<br />33.&nbsp; Get some dry ice and have some fun (try not to burn yourself)&nbsp; <br />34.&nbsp; Get a sober sitter to take you on a drive...go through a car-wash, while in the car wash...hot box with a blunt while listening to awesome music.&nbsp; This is my favorite way to smoke blunts.<br />35.&nbsp; Go to a museum or look at paintings.&nbsp; &nbsp;Paintings become their own little movie.&nbsp; They will move and are quite entertaining.&nbsp; <br />36.&nbsp; Drink Wine or Beer <br />37.&nbsp; Play some visually cool Video Games<br />38.&nbsp; Watch some classic Cartoons (Bugs Bunny, Inspector Gadget…)<br />39.&nbsp; Gambling is supposedly fun and some say you are better at it whilst tripping.&nbsp; I imagine being in Vegas would be the ideal situation on Acid.&nbsp; <br />40.&nbsp; Go skiing or snowboarding.<br />41.&nbsp; Watch a 3-d Movie.<br />42.&nbsp; Film yourself, or Snap a picture here and there.&nbsp; Set up a camera on a tripod in the room and forget about it.&nbsp; Or actively film some or all of your trip.&nbsp; Watching the footage when your sober is very entertaining and often will help you keep some of those amazing memories that are almost always forgotten when you trip balls.<br />43.&nbsp; Skydiving is said to be intense, I can’t even imagine this though.<br />44.&nbsp; &nbsp;Petting a cat or a furry animal. <br />45.&nbsp; http://new.weavesilk.com/&nbsp; This website is interactive art you make with your mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Pretty cool!!!!<br />46.&nbsp; Close your eyes and think about how you are able to even think.&nbsp; Think about the fact that we are on a Rock flying through space, and that this Rock orbits a star.&nbsp; Think about Infinity and the universe and ask yourself: &quot;What is reality?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot;&nbsp; Let your mind wander and voice record your thoughts.&nbsp; Listen to them on another day.<br />47. stream of consciousness writing<br />48.&nbsp; Buy some Gallium online.&nbsp; Gallium is a metal with a melting point of about 85 degrees f. When you hold it in your hand for a minute or so it starts to liquify into what looks like Mercury. Gallium is not dangerous like Mercury however. You can easily buy some online for around $40. I think it would be a cool thing to play with while tripping.<br />49.&nbsp; Go to a reflexologist or have a masseuse (if you can handle interacting with people while tripping that is)&nbsp; if you don&#039;t know what reflexology is, google it and go do it.&nbsp; It&#039;s mind-blowing. <br />50.&nbsp; Go to a Diner at the end of the Experience and recharge your brain.&nbsp; Reminisce with your tripping partners on your experience (Go Through any pictures you may&#039;ve taken)<br />Any other suggestions?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D ;D

				Most of the things on your list sound great, especially the outdoor activities. I really like walking down empty streets and through empty parks in the middle of the night with my headphones in listening to my favorite trippy albums. I always listen to Animals by Pink Floyd and The Mollusk by Ween at least once during the trip.<br /><br />Being from a rural area in one of the mountain states, it is really easy to just walk and not have to worry about running into anyone unless you want to. And it&#039;s so quiet at night it almost feels like I&#039;m in a bubble observing the world vibrating slowly around me. It feels good to me being an observer, a fly on the wall not influencing or affecting the world around me.<br /><br />But if I&#039;m inside tripping I like to play video games with a lot of color and ambient noise. Something simple and fun like golf where you can watch the trees and grass on the screen swaying and bubbling over.<br /><br />Oh man, that made me reminisce a lot. I haven&#039;t tripped in like three years, I&#039;ll have to do it again sometime soon I think.

				Personally, whenever I trip I do not like to have a list. That being said there are a few must-do&#039;s. <br />1) shower<br />2) sex<br />3) music<br /><br />The reason I don&#039;t like having a list is because I want to go on an adventure. 2CP has taken me on an hours walk at 2AM and vomiting on my neighbors lawn. Shrooms has taken me to the lake nearby to watch the sunrise. Some things just happen and that&#039;s what makes trips so much more interesting. <br />
