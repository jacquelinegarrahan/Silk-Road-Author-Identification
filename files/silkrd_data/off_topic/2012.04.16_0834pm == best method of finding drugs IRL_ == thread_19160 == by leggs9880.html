				First of all-please don&#039;t give me too much shit for this.&nbsp; I&#039;m not asking about specific areas or anything like that.&nbsp; But up until finding SR, I had been clean for a few years and lost all my old connects.&nbsp; Those people I met through friends and friends of friends from back in high school, but now I don&#039;t even know any potheads IRL.&nbsp; And yeah I like SR, but would also be interested in maybe being able to buy shit IRL on occasion.&nbsp; <br /><br />And no, not weed.&nbsp; That I can find.&nbsp; I&#039;m talking more harder stuff, like opiates/coke and the like.&nbsp; I&#039;ve thought about going to a needle exchange or methadone clinic, but also have heard that undercover cops sit in unmarked cars in the parking lot looking for this type of behavior.&nbsp; <br /><br />So yeah, I&#039;m opening myself up to ridicule here, but whatever, anyone with a good way of finding shit IRL that cares to share it, please do.

				You could go down to whatever dodgy areas there are and ask the scumbag looking people if they&#039;ll help you out but the chances are you will be sold SHIT, if not shit, then something that is HEAVILY cut, and you might even get robbed altogether.<br /><br />The other method is to just be social and meet other people that take drugs when you are out and about.. go to parties with like minded people.. then over the course of a few months/years you get your contacts. That&#039;s the only way to get reliable ones at any rate.<br /><br />But seeing as you probably cant be bothered spending that much time, you&#039;re gonna have to approach some dodgy looking fuckers. I&#039;d say there&#039;s a 90% chance you get sold sugar.

				Hookers. Walk by one and ask them where to buy. They usually get a cut from some pimp dealer for referring new drug customers. Ask some homeless guy to go introduce you to a legit dealer, offer them a finders fee or something. Obviously don&#039;t give them money and wait, they won&#039;t come back. Hella risky all of this of course, strap on your balls of steel and don&#039;t bring your regular wallet full of cards and money. Decoy wallet with just enough cash to buy and ID in a separate pocket for your win<br /><br />There are also people on craigslist in the platonic personals looking for drugs. &quot;Where can I get some party supplies or where can I get some white?&quot; usually will start an email exchange with a local dealer. Don&#039;t go to their place, or some secluded area. Meet at a cafe and just quietly pass to each other or something.<br /><br />i knew a girl in Philly that had to drive to the ghetto and buy drugs off some kids who loitered around an abandoned building just to get weed. 60/40 chance you will be robbed or arrested. <br /><br /><br />

				dunno about opiates as those guys usually stay indoors, but pills - go to clubs and look for the fuckers with the crazy wide eyes that are chewing their face, surely if you&#039;ve been in the game before you know how to spot a gurner when you see one. if they are chewing their face they&#039;re gonna be too loved up to fuck you over and you might get a freebie, then if you chill/dance with em for a bit by the end of the night you&#039;ll have a connect.<br /><br />looking for coke it&#039;s more the pub/bar scene, again if you&#039;ve been in the game before you can spot someone coked up, but you have to be a bit more careful as some of these guys can be a bit aggressive if you approach them. look for a coupla guys chatting away with big smiles on their faces, and if they go to the bog in pairs you know what they&#039;re up to ;) offer to get a round in cos &#039;you&#039;re new in the area&#039; and see how it goes from there<br /><br />i think these are the least likely ways to get robbed when you are looking to score, but it does go without saying - if you meet someone in a pub and ask them to hook you up DO NOT give them money and wait for them, you&#039;ll never see it or them again

				Before SR i was in a similar situation. After settling down, getting married etc i didn&#039;t go out as much anymore and lost my contacts. The places i knew were hotspots were closed down. Bought a few time on the streets but got sold shit 100% of the time (and even if it isn&#039;t 100% shit, you don&#039;t know what your taking which isn&#039;t very reassuring).<br /><br />Going to regular clubs you might score some pills, but usually people take just a personal amount which they intend to use. And it&#039;s really embarrasing to go around clubs in your 30s asking people for drugs. Approaching cokeheads in bars is dodgy as fuck as well. Best luck i had was in the john, asking people very casually if they could spare some after they just did it, or ask if they know someone.<br /><br />Best places are illegal parties or squats imo but you got to fit in that scene a bit or people won&#039;t trust you.

				Friends of friends, driving around ghettos if that&#039;s a common thing in your area (heard it is that way in the states) usually works.

				I was at a dudes place over easter and another bloke was skiting off about his awesome drug contact, &quot;I&#039;ve got access to drugs from anywhere and everywhere!&quot; was his opening remark! <br />I chuckled and said riiiight, with a little feigned disbelief, then he just shoots it out straight away <br />&quot;no shit mate, I can get drugs from the internet&quot;, <br />i said bullshit, whats the name of the site? <br />&quot;It&#039;s called silk road, but you&#039;ll never find it. I&#039;ve been using it for a month and I got sent a special link from a dude in the know. It&#039;s all invite only and you&#039;ve gotta be verified to get in&quot; <br />I asked him to get me one <br />&quot;nah mate, there not giving any more away, its super exclusive, but come and see me if you want shit, I can get PURE man PURE, totally uncut 100% MDMA, 500 a gram&quot;<br />Yeah? really? I can get it for 200 a gram, but mines only 80%, i didn&#039;t think mdma came any more pure than that<br />&quot;nah mate, i get %100 pure mdma, I&#039;ll shout ya next time i get some, gonna be much better than any of your cut shit&quot;<br />By this point I couldn&#039;t keep a straight face and had to leave the room!<br /><br />I guess the point of this BS reminising, is that even mates or mates of mates can be full of shit and rip you off!!!

Just talk to people and don&#039;t be a dick and they&#039;ll probably be your friend and give you drugs. Take some food/water to share or some diesel for the generator though so you&#039;re not just scrounging.

				A lot of it depends on your age. If your middle aged and walk into a college bar your going to have a hard time - sorry, but it&#039;s the truth.<br /><br />That being said, there are a few places that have a high probability of success; strip clubs, concert venues, and homeless people.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good idea to go where you mix into the crowd based on race/ ethnicity, age, and appearance.&nbsp;

				My suggestions would be to start slowly hanging out more with the ones who you know do drugs and eventually you come out with some connects. Another suggestion is to just be curt and ask people what you are looking for, have no shame lol.

				i would agree with what everyone has said but please remember it can be dangerous. find you a buddy to go to the bars/parties with you. he doesn&#039;t have to be all up in your business because sometimes its shady dealing with someone new and their friend lol. but bring along someone you know will have your back!
