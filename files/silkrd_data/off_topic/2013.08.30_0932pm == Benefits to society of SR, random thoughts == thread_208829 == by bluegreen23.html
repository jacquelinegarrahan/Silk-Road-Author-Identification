				So for a little while here I was considering SR and what it may or may not mean on a larger scale to society and the general joe schmo. Just thought I would share my random thoughts.<br /><br />1) less criminal activity in an area: SR requires no dealers on the street, no look outs, muscle, or gangs to keep territory. This obviously translates in some way to a safer neighborhood that would most likely have a group of men and woman involved in criminal activity. This could lessen violence, break ins, potential spill over to the community.<br />2) Continuing with #1, less criminals needed- if you no longer need runners, look outs, gun carrying thugs, and all the rest, there is a chance that some percentage of these people that would be &quot;victims of their environment&quot; forced/lured to the drug trade may find other avenues for prosperity. <br />3) less exposure to drugs- almost self defeating for the vendors. If there isn&#039;t some guy on the corner pitching weed, coke, meth etcetcetc then there is most likely less exposure and opportunity for people to try these substances. I realize there will always be someone waiting to stand on a corner, but in theory if a town had only 10 users and all of them bought from SR then there would be no one on the corner trying to sell to fresh clients. Again this is more or less a numbers game. Some possible less exposure may prevent some kids from becoming users until they are old enough to grasp the consequences.<br />4) limiting the stupid from doing harm to themselves- I&#039;m by no means an expert with a computer, or with Tor, or encryption. I like to think I&#039;ve done alright in my short time here and am still trying to learn and understand things more clearly. However I do believe that I&#039;m a reasonably intelligent person and therefore have managed to access this site. Protecting those that are not intelligent enough to make sound choices simply through complexity of the systems used may act as a fail safe preventing someone from being taken advantage or getting in over their head without even knowing it. <br />5) limited violence- this is a semi return to #1. not only is it a limit to violence on the corner but it is also a limit to robbery by vendor/seller from each other (i know people get scammed but no ones getting shot in the face for it.) It removes the possible spill over violence. Less violence is usually a good thing, even LE will agree with that. Odds are that most LE will be more amicable to a non violent criminal. <br />6) employment- well this may cut down on needing head breaking LE (which doesnt seem to serve the community to well) it does keep railroad workers, truck drivers, pilots, postal workers, couriers, computer sales people, office supply stores and all the other up stream legit workers that supply materials and services employed. This also includes customs officials. <br />7) police to do real police work- I know for my own beliefs that there are many police that &quot;knock heads&quot; and don&#039;t serve and protect. They are bullies and don&#039;t do any real good. they are interested in street rips, and catching non-violent criminals. They spend there time doing things that don&#039;t improve the community in a meaningful way. With less of this &quot;clearing corner&quot; work police may be forced to actually do things that serve the public. <br /><br />Just some thoughts I cared to share.
