				Earlier today, I sold a decent amount of LSD to a group of party-goers.&nbsp; Originally, I bought 100 blotters, and man, did I have a hell of a time selling all of it.<br />Perhaps I don&#039;t have the right clientele, or maybe acid just isn&#039;t as wanted as I thought among people in my area.<br /><br />I know if I had my hands on a bulk amount of marijuana, I probably wouldn&#039;t have such a hard time selling it.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely the drug of choice around here, but what&#039;s second best?<br /><br />Curious as to which drugs are popular/wanted in your area?

				also meth, much cheaper than weed thing so or equal (based how u know the people). Heroin very small % of users and people looking like &quot;wow&quot; or got some distance... Coke rising in popularity and prices are falling last years, but mostly its a parody on coke. Benzos almost none selling, just what you can get from other sources (guy, which got from his grandma or so) but the doctors are also benevolent and prescribe you pretty easy some range of pills you need/want. Shrooms during teh sason, and sometimes goes around some MDMA...

				seems like opiates have replaced state currency in my neighborhood.&nbsp; everyone here is jammed up on some sort of pills.<br /><br />also, booze is quite popular here; lots of shitfaced blue collar joes and hoes stumbling around town.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t imagine that there&#039;s too many coke heads because the price is so insane, but 20 miles away in the ghettos there is plenty of crack going around.&nbsp; I live a little too close to the atlantic for there to be any meth (thank god)...thats more of a midwest/west coast thing.<br /><br />in the music scenes that i&#039;ve encountered molly is queen.&nbsp; if my wife would allow it, I could become a zillionaire selling tony&#039;s molly at clubs and parties.

				Weed reigns as king and Molly is his queen in my area. Cocaine is big too but the scene is so sketchy that most people don&#039;t even want to attempt to obtain some and of course prescription drugs such as painkillers, oxy, and adderall. <br /><br />Psychs aren&#039;t big around here which sucks for people that want to get into them because you have assholes selling eigths of basic cubensis for $30 and 50ug LSD blotters for $15.

				Weed is the drug of choice in Canada. Alcohol is #1, but we&#039;re on SR so it&#039;s not worth talking about. It&#039;s hard to find quality coke from my experience, especially outside the major cities so SR is revelation. Ketamine is huge is Toronto, haven&#039;t seen it much anywhere else.<br /><br />

				In England the most popular by far is coke. Cheap shit coke. It is literally everywhere. Alot of heroin too and the kids are always on the latest legal dogshite. If you&#039;re far enough down the line you could probably get half decent cocaine but it&#039;s a struggle. Some good weed nowadays due to the farms. When i was a youngster all we got was soapbar hash.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trips are almost non existant and pills just keep getting weaker but plenty of MDMA powder. oh, and ket........ plenty of that lovely stuff

				Weed, blow, MD - Dealers are beyond the call of duty when it comes to these. 2-CB is blowing up atm also. Brown&#039;s always quite steady IMO (not a massive user!.) K and LSD seem really hard to score. <br /><br />Cant deal w/ paying 20 for a gram o k&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Weed and crack here in eastern US. College towns are good for selling psychs and MDMA. Not as much meth or H.

				MDMA by far. There aren&#039;t really many links for 2CB and psychs round here, but when I had .5g of 2CB it went fast, so I think if there were a better supply it&#039;d be pretty popular<br />Also weed

				Mostly just weed and alcohol here. About a year ago the huge craze was about bath salts / potpourri. This guy was&nbsp; just selling it straight up out of his local smoke shop and all was fine until a few teens did some crazy things (police actually witnessed one guy driving down the road and he pulled over, got out of his car, took off his clothes and ran away.)&nbsp; This shit was really making some people go crazy. Eventually the cops raided his store and found some illegal shit and he&#039;s currently serving a looong sentence for it. <br /><br />LE actually went so far as to go around to individual high schools and host assemblies urging people not to use potpourri.

The more weed is available, the more people will be smoking weed. If MDMA is in high supply, kids will take it, but if there&#039;s speed or coke instead they&#039;ll probably do that. Same goes for the various psychedelics.<br /><br />This assumption is based off of my subjective observations from when I was a student at university and of course may not be true in all cases (ex. Heroin)
