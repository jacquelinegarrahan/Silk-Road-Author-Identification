				Each dog is trained to smell one single drug.<br /><br />Cocaine <br />Heroin <br />Cannibas<br /><br />are the three most common - Although, X, speed and the likes are really just as popular. <br /><br />Some dogs are trained to react to the dog handlers actions, like if they tug the lead a certain way, then the dog knows that it&#039;s time to do what it was trained to do, which could be to sit next to a person the handlers suspects to have drugs, or to start barking.<br /><br />Often this is what they do at festivals/train-stations/airports, they don&#039;t have a dog searching for a single drug, instead they just make the dog react near people they think look dodgy, just so they have a liable reason to search.

At things like airports they will have dogs trained to smell different explosives/drugs.<br /><br />But then they will usually have a dog trained just to react when told to, so that if they see someone/something suspicious they will actually have grounds to search.<br /><br />At things like festivals, they will usually only carry the dogs that are trained to react - over in the UK, it&#039;s estimated that 1 in 5 people carry drugs in to a festival.. But how many arrests do you actually see?<br /><br />If you are expected to be a heroin dealer, and the LE raid you for dealing heroin - they&#039;ll probably bring a dog trained to find heroin.

				As far as I&#039;ve been told and from what I&#039;ve read, standard US certification for a detector dog may include:<br />heroin<br />cocaine<br />methamphetamine<br />cannabis (this is maybe about to be a problem in WA/CO)<br />sometimes MDMA<br /><br /><br />These are the items listed most often on certification, but they can certainly be trained to recognize anything else, I have trained my pet dogs to recognize the scent of cinnamon, my car keys, single malt, and baking powder... uh, not all at the same time, I have not yet had to teach my pets to find me while drunk, driving, and making cinnamon rolls.<br /><br />Some certifications in North America will take two drugs (cocaine and heroin, cocaine and cannabis, etc.) as a minimum, but in my very limited experience, the dogs always know at least two and usually more. However, the dogs I&#039;ve met have probably been rockstar dogs, since they are being used for demos/teaching, so Slicksuit may have a better handle on the real world. The cert standards I&#039;ve seen usually identify two drugs as a minimum, I might be reading extra-tough standards. The demo dogs I&#039;ve watched can usually ID at least 3 of the above.<br /><br />Reason had a short article that included a nice overview of cues (conscious/unconscious) and the Clever Hans problem... <br /><br />

				I was just reading a case about a man who was pulled over and the officer thought that he smelled marijuana. So the officer calls a k9 unit to come do a search, he immediately alerts on the trunk. The officer opens the trunk and finds two pounds of crystal meth, or something like that. It is still going through the court system but the defendant thinks he can get off because the dog was only called in because the officer thought he smelled marijuana. It is now a question of an unlawful search, should the cop been able to detain the man and wait for the k9, or even call the k9 in the first place if all he smelled was weed? this is taking place in Colorado where weed is now legal.<br /><br />oh, and he got pulled over because his tabs were expired

Bear in mind these kids are like 10-14 years old just trying to make a little bit of money because there is nothing else they can do in these kind of places.

Took me a whole 10 minutes to realize what you had changed.<br /><br />Read it over about 15 times, and was like &quot;what the fuck is this guy talking about, he didn&#039;t change anything!&quot;<br /><br />But yes, most LE are total egotistic dick-heads, although I have met a couple who were alright.<br /><br />Well... 2, actually.<br /><br />At a festival at about 5.00AM, myself and a group of friends were being a bit anti-social and screaming and shouting and had a pretty large amount of drugs on us - between us all, 10 grams of K, half an ounce of MDMA and an ounce of weed.<br /><br />The two LE officers came over to speak to us, and there was about a gram of K on a CD case sitting in open view along with all of the weed. <br /><br />When they came over, they were just like &quot; We will forget we seen all that boys, just keep the noise down please &quot;. Pretty decent of them or we all would have been chucked out of the festival. <br /><br />Me being absolutely off my tits at the time, I was trying to convince them to sit and take some of it with us - and they were even cool about that, just laughed and walked away. <br /><br />Some LE can be alright, they are human beings after all - but it seems like they are a lot more lenient over here in the UK compared to the U.S. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Love it! Here in the uk festivals seem to just be a hallowed ground where anything goes as soon as a critical mass of punters start rolling. I myself have been sat in the grass with friends surrounded by paraphernalia nevermind the gurns and they just dont care. Any arrests mean so much paperwork I think thats why they dont bother. But on the other hand iv seen police deliberately trying to fuck with clubbers once they leave like pushing them around as theyre trying to leave the venue<br /><br />Overall... fuck da police

So the officer calls a k9 unit to come do a search, he immediately alerts on the trunk. The officer opens the trunk and finds two pounds of crystal meth, or something like that. It is still going through the court system but the defendant thinks he can get off because the dog was only called in because the officer thought he smelled marijuana. It is now a question of an unlawful search, should the cop been able to detain the man and wait for the k9, or even call the k9 in the first place if all he smelled was weed? this is taking place in Colorado where weed is now legal.<br /><br />oh, and he got pulled over because his tabs were expired<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Makes me wonder what LE are going to do with all of the drug dogs that are trained to smell marijuana once it is legalized nationally. They can&#039;t like tell the dogs not respond to marijuana anymore because its now legal so are all of the current drug dogs going to become obsolete? Also once it is legalized nationally, it seems that less drugs other than marijuana will be caught because I would guess a majority of people are originally noticed due to the pungent smell of marijuana and then other drugs are found.

				I remember not too long ago, I had just eaten a bud brownie and smoked a bowl when my lady and I started fighting all crazy. So I left the house to cool down; My car ended up breaking down, but before it came to a complete stop I was able to coast into a gas station. I thought I was lucky until I realized I had just pulled over next to two police k-9 SUV&#039;s. The cops were already inside but after I sat there for a minute I realized the dogs were barking at me like fuck. I don&#039;t know if they were just barking to bark (pretty sure they are trained not to do that) or if they were alerted by the smell of weed seeping from my pores, but I was paranoid as fuck. I HATE COPS
