				Not a single person is going to buy your sperm lol, it cost a lot of money for a reason. <br /><br />They do lengthy and time consuming RFLP and other primer annealing test&#039;s on a donor&#039;s sperm&#039;s DNA to ensure there are no lets say recessive gene&#039;s that could be VERY problematic.&nbsp; You can go on SUBJECTIVELY describing you want, but saying&nbsp; &quot;I am a tall, Caucasian, naturally healthy, intelligent, physically fit male. Brown hair, hazel eyes- a looker if i don&#039;t say so myself&quot; but WHAT THE FUCK does that have to do with your sperm and it&#039;s DNA?<br /><br />You said at the end &quot;with no hereditary diseases or mental issues&quot;, so you&#039;ve had a DNA panel done to test for all known recessive/hereditary conditions?&nbsp; That&#039;s an EXPENSIVE test, and you&#039;re saying you&#039;ve done it, wow.&nbsp; As to the mental issues, well i&#039;ll let the attempt at vending ones own sperm on SR speak for that one.<br /><br />A lot of the time it&#039;s not the MAN&#039;s fault (and if it is it&#039;s not necessarily because of &#039;low sperm count&#039;).<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t agree with that. fuck the man, fuck having to wait, and fuck your boyfriends/husband/you&#039;re low sperm count&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with you, fuck the woman is what you&#039;re after (well if you wish to conceive), waiting=quality, and fuck your disgusting view that conception issues are always the man&#039;s fault and always due to low sperm count ... MASS MEDIA FTW (I thought you said you were intelligent).<br /><br />Fuck I (and every other man out there) would be rich as fuck if I could sell my sperm for $400 for 3 shots, fuck i&#039;d be making over 2k a day EASY !<br /><br /><br />

				quinone, you sound butthurt. just for you, ill knock you one out half price. just to get the ball rolling.<br /><br />I addressed the possible recessive gene issue- you&#039;re right, the tests to find out about these problems are expensive; yet you critique my relatively costly price?<br /><br />if its not the mans fault, then my offering sperm wont help them conceive. i am appealing to a niche market in which is IS due to the males inability to conceive. due to there ineffective sperm. don&#039;t let it upset you mate. <br /><br />also, listing physical and mental attributes has huge amounts to do with DNA, are you serious? yeah, we can get into the nature/nurture argument; but its the two. and what I am offering is one part of the puzzle. <br /><br />haha, dopeboy stops trying to threadjack, its about quality, not quantity. remember that guys&nbsp; ;)

I guessed you were probably a 40 year old virgin with your first sentence: &quot;You put forth a seething alpha male attitude, and men who act that way piss me right off.&quot; Then, just a couple sentences later, I knew: &quot;I just blew a load on a sheet of paper about an hour ago cuz I was horny and wanted to masturbate, does it have any value?&quot; Now, not to say we all dont enjoy a nice rub out once in a while, but it is that &quot;seething alpha-male attitude&quot; you speak of that is gonna take the cake for you. Its what ladies like. Why the fuck you think the Alpha-Male runs the pride and has all the females hunting for him. That&#039;s nature, the alpha-male wins. Unless youre Hyenas, haha. Im not trying to rag on you at all, just give you a bit of advice. Give up the &quot;were all the same &amp; need to be treated &amp; loved equally by everyone no matter who we are&quot; attitude. Yes, it is essentially true, but unless everyone or at least a large amount of people begin approaching every aspect of their lives in that way it will never work. Stay open minded to the possibility, but dont approach your entire life that way. Most people are assholes, that is the truth. So, go to the world &amp; show them that you are the SHIT. A product of all these assholes. Though, where most that take this approach make the mistake is here: Dont hate on the next man for also believing that he is the SHIT. The great thing is, we can all be the SHIT at the same time. So, my friend, you are the best this world as to offer indefinitely, know that fact &amp; it will be true. Perception is everything: &quot;To a worm, digging a hole in the ground all day is more relaxing than fishing.&quot; Check out this book sir, it may help you get some pussy &quot;Assholeology: The Science Behind Getting Your Way - and Getting Away with it&quot; if not its a good read anyways... <br /><br />As for AlwaysTrying, his name truly collaborates. This is quite an elaborate sham here. Haha... But thumbs up sir, if some dumb tweeker cunt can convince her man that they need to order some sperm off of you in order to create their crack baby then&nbsp; kudos to you sir. Money is only a number made by humans to represent the amount of energy placed into productive activities. Sperm is, essentially, one of the MOST productive compounds we know of... The only activities, in my belief, that are not productive are those that conflict with the 10 Commandments. Whether you are religious or not those are the only true laws that are not based on someones personal gain. So, that being said, as long as you are not thinking about any women you are not married to while you rub out the loads you are selling then the offspring produced will be wholly righteous indeed, because that is considered adultery. Keep on Trying friend. Never give up.<br /><br />Fuck the World... Now that&#039;s Adultery :)<br /><br />-MR. CranE-

				Mr.Crane, the women who &#039;hunt&#039; for alpha males are inevitably the biggest bitches too, I don&#039;t want that shit in my life, and if I have to wait until i&#039;m 50 to meet a woman who I .. enjoy being around and is not a dumb and/or manipulative bitch, then so be it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t just want pussy.&nbsp; If I did so badly i&#039;d hire an escort.&nbsp; I&#039;m lonely and shit but i&#039;d rather that then have to tolerate a half-ass and pointless relationship.<br /><br />If my use of big words is offensive to our current social climate (as you eluded to right away), then, FUCK IT!&nbsp; I&#039;ll say what I want, how I want.&nbsp; If &#039;talking smart&#039; somehow lowers my place in our social hierarchy&#039; then it&#039;s simply a sign that jealousy runs rampant, but so does pride.&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides, fuck society and what it thinks, our culture is to delude ourselves that other people are better because of ridiculous social standards that exist (eg. celebrities, they are normal people, they are not special) while also knowingly allowing ourselves to be wrapped in layer upon layer of media induced fearmongering, turning us more and more mindless by the day.<br /><br />It&#039;s people like you, and sociopath&#039;s like mambo (who can&#039;t take and read text seriously) that degrade our way of life, and should we survive our own demise (should we/you with the ego initiate it), it will be the few intelligent people left who will rebuild everything that you know, while feeding on your worthless flesh !

				I think both quinone and MR. CranE have good points.<br /><br />The way i see it is that all/most women act bitchy to strangers that walk up to them as a social shield and then a percentage of those just always act that way. Girls get hit on multiple times a day, you can&#039;t expect them to invest their time and energy into every random guy.<br /><br />The point I&#039;m trying to make is even if a girl is not &quot;a dumb and/or manipulative bitch&quot; you still have to play the game of demonstrating your social value while lowering hers in order to win her over.<br /><br />She has to believe that you are of value to her in order for her to pursue you.<br /><br />That&#039;s why even if you are the coolest, most intelligent and kind guy in the world you will still not get a girl if you can&#039;t DEMONSTRATE it.<br /><br />Truth is that the process of seduction has a lot to do with manipulation, and even though there is a big difference between peoples end games (ie one night stand with &quot;a dumb and/or manipulative bitch&quot; vs loving relationship with a really cool girl), the process stays pretty much the same.<br /><br />Sorry if that was not articulate enough... I&#039;m very tired. :)

				I think it&#039;s funny the 10 Commandments made its way into this thread!! LOL. How come it doesn&#039;t include &quot;Thou shalt not rape&quot;???? Or &quot;thou shalt not molest little boys&quot; So, let&#039;s being up the Mortal Sins, then. A Mortal Sin is one which guarantees your passage into hell, and the devil your soul. So, here you are, at SR, so, you&#039;re probably a mortal sinner. Greed, Lust, Pride, &amp; Sloth dominate our lives. Lust &amp; Pride go with my seething alpha male bad attitude. Most vendors are greedy, hence the exorbitant prices to a worldwide market. If they truly wanted to spread the happiness, it&#039;d be closer to free, than overpriced, right? And sloth is the result of many of our habits. <br />We&#039;re all going to hell....<br />...that is...<br />if you believe that kind of thing. <br />Not trying to get into a religious argument here, just posting some things I don&#039;t think people think about often. <br /><br />As for alwaystrying, gfl.

				I am a new member to Silk Road.&nbsp; A big part of joining Silk Road is because I wanted to be free to purchase sperm online from strangers if I ever felt so inclined.
