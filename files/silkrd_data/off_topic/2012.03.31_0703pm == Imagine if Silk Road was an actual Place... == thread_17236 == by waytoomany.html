				I imagine it as a giant road of golden sand with vendor after vendor selling various things out of their carts.<br /><br />Tony76(1%) is the very first vendor on the road... then comes AAkoven(2%) so on and so forth.<br /><br />The road has many outlets to different areas, leading to the rave clubs, opium dens, porn theatres(for those who hang out in XXX), and etc.<br /><br />Also, the banks(btcbuddy, btcking, etc) have atm&#039;s dispensing coins. <br /><br /><br />DPR still remains hidden... he&#039;s there but nobody knows who he is.

				Nope, I&#039;m just not blinkered. Good on you for buying your blow from the roughest part of your state, probs took about 5 minutes. The person you said that to is a seller. If you sell in quantity and you have to stay in on place all day % chances of getting fucked over obviously increase by quite a few times. It&#039;s completely logical not to work somewhere like that and work here because it takes all of that out of it. It&#039;s called just making life easy for yourself and not having to do things the hard way... <br /><br />
