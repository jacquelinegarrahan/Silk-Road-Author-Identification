				Hey guys, I am making sort of a swoop order prior to a working vacation (I&#039;m privileged enough to be a freelance writer that makes enough to live off it and travel) and have decided I will be making a stash dedicated to the great Dr Gonzo. I might even put up some pictures of it.<br /><br />I began with a nice leather bar kit case I picked up for a song at a local thrift shop. After a quick clean, I tossed in for starters:<br /><br />- A Bic<br />- Small glass holdout pipe<br />- Pipe tool<br />- Isopropyl<br />- Wicks, flints, and fluids for my Zippo<br />- Tallow beeswax for the glass pipe<br />- Grinder<br />- Bottle o&#039; Jagermeister<br />- 9 sterile cryotubes I picked up from a warehouse store for the same song as above, but unplugged<br />- A small metal box for tabs<br />- Vitamin C<br />- Some of my friends homegrown Kush<br /><br />I already know I&#039;m ordering some acid, ketamine, 2-CE, shrooms, hash, speed, and DMT. I&#039;m hoping I can swing some peyote and mescaline as well...<br /><br />But, I wanted to know if there&#039;s anything obvious I&#039;m missing! I won&#039;t touch coke or heroin, but I&#039;m building the ultimate stash, so I shouldn&#039;t leave anything out!<br /><br />Ideas? Opinions?<br /><br />the ghost

				From fear and loathing... &quot;The trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers . . . and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . . . Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we&#039;d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.&quot;<br /><br />So you definitely NEED mescaline... its the 3000 year old classic. Forget the 2c-e unless you want to be too sick to write in my opinion, you should go with 2c-b. Youre also missing benzos, barbs, much more alcohol, amyl nitrates, and ETHER!!! haha... have fun with that one. Even if you dont want H, you should definitely have some prescription opiates or opium, a necessary part of any downer collection. Need tobacco. Lacking: MDMA. NITROUS!!! wider variety of tryptamines, a psychedelic amphetamine like DOM, a DAT inhibitor like methylphenidate, a deliriant like scopolamine, and a get out of jail free card.

				Definitely getting some of the San Pedro cactus clippings, DOM sounds interesting, as does scopolamine. I just raided my Monopoly set, and grabbed a bottle of rum, a bottle of tequila, rolling tobacco, papers, etc.<br /><br />As far as the 2C family, I&#039;ve never tried any of the wonder letter and numbers drugs. I&#039;m more an LSD kind of guy, but many people have said 2-Ce is pleasantly similar.<br /><br />I&#039;m also grabbing some MDA to cut the K with, personal thing. Good call!<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve always wanted to amass a kit like this..<br /><br />I would want in my travel kit:<br /><br />A large selection of &#039;e&#039; - pills from around the world, from times in the past... This will be the adventure choice as you won&#039;t know what the effects will be like until it&#039;s too late ;)<br /><br />MDMA<br />MDA<br />Ketamine<br />Amphetamine<br />Methamphetamine (or some &quot;Go-Pills&quot;)<br /><br />At least 5 large Sativa buds of different strains (Super Silver Haze must be included)<br />At least 2 large Indica buds<br />A hunk of dark spicy hash<br /><br />LSD<br />DMT <br />Dried and powdered shrooms<br /><br />Opium.<br />Valium<br /><br />Something to cancel out psychoactive effects<br /><br /><br />If I could take that lot to the full moon parties I would be one happy bunny.

				Amyls are hard to get now, but would be worthwhile I think.<br />I used to play with my dads amyls when I was a kid (he was in the army and it was part of their &quot;kit&quot; lol) but I had no idea what they were.<br />Ether you can make, I believe.&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytdO3YzXNkQ<br /><br />HST&#039;s Fear and Loathing was not an account of something he actually did though... he wrote it in a hotel room all right, but didn&#039;t wander around Vegas all messed up like in the story.&nbsp; It&#039;s a damned good story though, RIP HST.

				@axaxax: That&#039;s pretty much my kit, except I&#039;d throw in cleaning and art supplies, nicotine, and like a compass or something... I tend to emergency hoard. But, cool beans there! Valium I&#039;m grabbing, throwing in a few Sildenafil Citrates and some Viagra for grins and giggles, but opium I don&#039;t know about...<br /><br />@ProudCannabian: Amyls sound neat, but supply is an issue. Ether, oh god, I want it so bad, but I don&#039;t feel like blowing the hell out of my workshop, or trying to find acid and sodium compounds for sale to people without licenses.<br /><br />Is anyone feeling pictures for this thing? I&#039;m hesitant to put pictures up as I don&#039;t want people to worry about security, but it&#039;s a glorious collection...

				if i could make a drug suitcase like fear and loathing it would have the following things:<br />5 grams of tanned mdma<br />25 red defqon rolls<br />25 25c-nbome blotters<br />an ounce of good cocaine<br />5 grams of mda<br />5 250ug swiss lsd blotters<br />1 ounce of super silver haze<br />1 ounce of blue dream<br />1 ounce of &#039;woody kush&#039; (pre 98 bubba kush x master kush x og kush)<br />25 1 mg xanax (for coming down, 2 mg doesnt help you come down, its just another head-change)<br />5 grams of nepalese temple ball hash (roll it into snake form and drop it in my blunts)<br />25 30mg adderall<br />aaaand....thats probably all i would need on my crazy drug binge. <br />and since i&#039;ve got some time on my hands heres how i would do these drugs. <br />i would start small so i dont go to the looney bin<br /><br />state fair first- take some 25c nbome and snort a little mdma til im feeling good enough to ride those swings that go above everybodys head, then find a funhouse or something, then to end the night rent a motel and smoke a lot of kush blunts with little snakes of hash thrown in<br /><br />next night, go a little bigger- <br />start the day with go carts, snort a little cocaine and when i peak from the coke, snort some mdma. after 2 hours of go carts i&#039;d go to a lazer tag place and take some 25c nbome, and snort some mdma, i&#039;d play lazer tag for about 2 hours and then find some video games to play still tripping on 25c nbome, then end the night with kush/hash blunts. <br /><br />next night go big or go home-<br />wake up snorting cocaine, go to vegas snorting cocaine the whole way there, go squirrel suit gliding from 13,000 feet out of a plane, (can&#039;t go high altitude while on mdma, possible anurism) then proceed to the nearest national forest to take acid, smoke 10 weed/hash blunts, then head back to vegas for the night life, snort the rest of my coke, take 3 rolls, then act a fool all over vegas.<br /><br />but thats just me....<br /><br /><br /><br />
