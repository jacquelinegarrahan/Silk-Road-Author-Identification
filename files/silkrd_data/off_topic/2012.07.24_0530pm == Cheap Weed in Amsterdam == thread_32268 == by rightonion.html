				So in a few weeks I will going back to my favourite city, Amsterdam :)<br /><br />This is my fourth trip now, however this time I am not going to be able to do my usual, and spend a stupid amount of cash a day on every different strain I see.<br /><br />Since I am on a much tighter budget I was wondering if anyone had any tips for sourcing cheaper weed/hash. I know it is generally cheaper in coffeeshops towards the outskirts of the city, such as haarlem but the difference only seems to be by&nbsp; a couple of euros best. Is there anywhere to buy larger bits ie more than 5g? I remember first time I was there there was a guy selling hash in the flea market, never checked the prices but I imagine that was significantly cheaper than the coffeeshops.<br /><br />Any advice or tips would be much appreciated <br /><br />Right

				I read that the coffee shops in Amsterdam are only available for the country&#039;s legal residents. Some new laws they implemented to prevent tourists from traveling only to do drugs in their country. Hopefully you find a workaround.

				Thanks for the quick reply. Yeh I thought that movement had to be passed county by county within Holland, and anyone in their right mind in the amsterdam council would not vito tourist buying weed, their main source of income. <br /><br />But anywhere for cheap weed?

				You can get bulk IF you know someone Dutch.<br /><br />I worked there so know that its possible to get bulk.<br /><br />Ask at a coffeeshop and no chance.<br /><br />Some will let you buy 5 grams, then go back, all night! IF its cheap enough its worth it.<br /><br />Vac seal, thrice, send back.<br /><br />NEVER walk through customs carrying. They are good at spotting that.

				Thanks Red. I suspected that might be the case, needing to know someone within the trade which is a shame :(<br /><br />And yeh post was my plan, I have had success in the past with this method.

				but you also can buy weed easy on the streets . just be careful not to get scammed or ripped by ppl they love to do that in the netherlands .<br /><br />the street price is half cheaper then coffeeshop prices. if you want 1 gr in a coffeeshop maybe you pay around 12eur and for a street dealer they ask around 6-7eur<br /><br />

				Yeh I have been approached before on the streets but that was usually for coke. Do you know the standard of &quot;street weed&quot; there. I imagine it is pretty high

				well most of the time is only 1 or 2 i think.<br /><br />its of good quality , BUT be aware of dealers that put cutting chems in the weed to make it heavy . so like 500gr of weed looks like 1kg. but they put chemicals in it to look like that. its bad for your health .<br /><br />but most dealers just sell good quality .
