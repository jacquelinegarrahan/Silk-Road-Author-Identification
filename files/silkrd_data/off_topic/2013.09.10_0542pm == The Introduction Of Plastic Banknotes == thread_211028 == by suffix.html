				Have the authorities finally struck the killer blow in the war on drugs or will i still be able to share my blood and snot with shopkeepers across the land by snorting gear through our new waterproof currency? <br /><br />it&#039;s a pity, i used to find there was nothing better for crushing up rocks and crystals than a 20 quid note and a spoon.<br /><br />onwards and upwards i suppose.

				No not credit cards...read the news lately??&nbsp; O,P&nbsp; this is like you say the first step in the move to completely eradicate bank notes. It will be credits soon just like Harry Reinquist used for his trip to mars.<br />Everyone had a credit then nobody has to touch notes at all.

				we have had plastic notes in Australia since the mid 90&#039;s&nbsp; catch up rest of the world you can swim with it accidently wash it and still use it and as for snorting drugs works great and you can lick the remainder off afterwards..&nbsp; Dont forget to take a ciggie butt out the paper and use the paper to keep the note rolled

				Snorting drugs with any dirty bank note is like wiping your foreskin on a filthy toilet seat... why the fuck would you do that? Use a straw or a clean piece of paper. <br />

				Alright, ya wanna talk silly, goofy bathroom shit? I used to find it amusing for some reason to piss on the toilet paper roll in bars , obviously I was a bit drunk at the time. This was years ago when I drank more than I do now. The best ones were the rolls that are inside those plastic things, so you can&#039;t really see the roll. People wouldn&#039;t notice it until they really, REALLY needed it, and then they were just fucked. The rolls in the plastic container things really took some commitment and effort. I used to have to get down on my knees and piss upwards into it. This obviously worked best in single , one person at a time types of bathrooms. I would then sit at the bar and watch the looks on peoples faces when they came out of the shitters, the ones that looked real pissed off and left the bar immediately would have me, and my friends who were aware of my schemish plot, rolling on the floor laughing.<br />Ya, I&#039;ve amused myself in some silly assed ways.

				One of the bars i frequented when younger had toilet brushes in every stall so I drank as much as I could without pissing then when I HAD to go went in started at the cubicle on the left and filled up the first toilet brush holder then pinched off as best as possible ran to the next cubicle and continued until empty or all were full, I only managed to fill all 8 on 2 occasions which I was and still am very proud of.&nbsp; I used to piss on the paper too, funniest at dingy little dives where you can do it to the girls paper as well
