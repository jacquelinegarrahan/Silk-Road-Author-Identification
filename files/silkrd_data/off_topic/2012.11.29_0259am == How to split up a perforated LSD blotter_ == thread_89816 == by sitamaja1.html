				UNPERFORATED******* not perforated :/<br /><br />I was wondering what would be the best way to &quot;cut&quot; out the strips? What I mean by that is, if all the &quot;trips&quot; are on 1 paper(assuming there&#039;s more than 1). Wouldn&#039;t I, cutting it with scissors or something, transfer some of the active ingredient to the scissors or to an equivalent utensil? And by tearing them with hands(some would absorb through skin) and would get really uneven pieces.<br />Ugh it&#039;s more of a ramble than a question really, what I meant to ask is: What&#039;s the best way to cut them out, lol.<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				I always clean my razor or scissors with rubbing alcohol then just cut them into separate doses, works fine...

				I expierienced the same concern when buying some acid off someone who just got a completley unmarked 100 sheet. I sat there and watched him man handle the thing for thirty minutes with his undoubtedly sweaty hands and sub-par scissors. after a while i even commented on how rough he was being with this incredibly fragile drug. Ended up tripping WAY harder on this dose than any other based on my hits (took only 3, but i have tripped harder when eating 8 of another for example). what i am trying to say is i just use scissors to cut that shit up and a ruler to measure. im usually left with a small hit which i just keep for myself. cut a 10 into 11 hits if ur really worried. good luck

				Tabs are 1/4&quot; x 1/4&quot; square.&nbsp; I mark a grid in pencil with a ruler and then use clean scissors to cut.&nbsp; It&#039;s paper, so it&#039;s not tricky.

				Oh,<br /><br />I also wanted to ask about the degrading.<br /><br />When I take the sheet out of the package will it degrade on a scale that should concern me?<br />Furthermore, how should I store it? I&#039;ve heard that a refrigerator will make the liquid condense when I take it out, so it might not be the best way?<br /><br />~~sitamaja

				Only take your tabs out when you plan on dosing and that will help with degradation, nothing else you can really do to prevent it any further. For storage get them sealed air tight then put them in the freezer.
