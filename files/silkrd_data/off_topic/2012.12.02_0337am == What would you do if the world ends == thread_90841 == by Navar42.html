				What would you do if the world did end this month. Where would you go first (banks, gun stores, pharmacy, ETC), what would you stockpiles (drugs, guns, gold, ETC) What would your survival plan be essentially. Sorry if this wasn&#039;t written well, I&#039;m pretty out of it right now. Got the idea for this thread from sandsnakes topic. If this has been done already just delete it. I&#039;ll updatethis with my own when I&#039;m more awake<br /><br />Let&#039;s hear some theories.

				Depends on the reason society collapsed.&nbsp; If it was a collapse of the world economy (capitalism) I would smile, organize, and my class would sweep away the ashes and build a new world.&nbsp; Oh yeah and drugs would be readily available in this new world.&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				Grab up all my friends and guns, drugs, and make sure to torrent all those crazy ass survival manuals like the anarchist cookbook v, and the military manuals, and find a nice walled in suburb and take it by force and make it my town.

				@thecrackhead, that a fuckin awesome tagline you have there...<br /><br />&quot;Take 100 aspirins for your last headache, it&#039;s legal!&quot;<br /><br />Whats fucked up as well is that the perfectly legal paracetamol is responsible for most drug related emergency calls and is one of the highest causes of drug related death. Just look at the annual report of your states emergency poisons call line on the www for confirmation.<br /><br />It goes like this usually... depressed person seeks attention and makes a faked suicide attempt by downing a fistful of paracetamols only to be told by doctors that unfortunately in 2-3 days time they are going to be dead through &#039;delayed liver or kidney failure&#039; (forget which). There is nothing doctors can do for them. Imagine the horror of that slow death !<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting to note too that the annual report of your states emergency poisons call line will show that the total for all illicit drugs COMBINED is comparably miniscule. <br /><br />Speaks for itself IMHO

				Simple, Id load the car up (guns, ammo, liquor and drugs) and head for a Super Walmart. Everything you need, food, clothing, ammo ect.<br /><br />Get some kind of roof top spot and make it rain lead.

				I suppose that would entirely develop on how things fall apart.<br /><br />If the world were to end in a few weeks (by asteroid impact or something similar), i would try to get to a friendly place if airlines and such still operated.<br /><br />I suppose they would not though, as there is no motivation for pilots and airline crew to continue working knowing they will be dead before the next paycheck comes.<br /><br />Limited to that i&#039;d probably collect as much food, drugs, alcohol etc as i feasibly could and just ride it out with local friends.

				Find my father, and the geck, and bring the waters of life to all in the waste land to drink.<br />&nbsp;-or-<br /><br />Get many friends, raid every apartment in the projects, i live in and collect supplies . after wards build a barricade around the perimeter of the projects, and start a little town, Called Marcy Houses. And then send out invitations to all my friends on facebook to come on down. But i&#039;d have a BYOB policy where they have to bring supplies and contribute if they want in. Then as shit gets stable, we would start sending out parties to kidnap docters, engineers, and other very needed personnel

				I suppose that depends on how the world will end exactly. There is not much use to have doctors around when an asteroid impact splits the planet in half ;)

				I suppose it depends on what you would consider the end if the world.<br /><br />Even if you could survive for a couple of years in a shelter while everyone on the surface dies, i fail to see the purpose of that. In such a case you would emerge from your shelter after a long period of time, finding a lifeless world on the surface. What is desirable about that at all? You&#039;d find yourself in a world that has no communication, no grid power, no fuel, not even food - getting hit by that asteroid in the head&nbsp; sounds like a better fate to me.
