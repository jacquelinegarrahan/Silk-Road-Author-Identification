				How does larger deals of cannabis go down? <br />I&#039;m thinking something like this case.<br />Fictional case:<br />-Someone has 3 kg of weed on his hands, and wants to sell it.<br />-He knows a local dealer who can handle such quantities.<br /><br />How should he first approach his dealer? <br />Should they arrange a meeting before the transaction?<br />Does the dealer need time to launder cash first? (It would be payed in cash right?)<br /><br />How would the transaction itself be handled? All at once? 1kg each time?<br />Would deals like these be dealt in remote places for safety reasons?<br /><br />I guess I&#039;m just inquiring about general do&#039;s and don&#039;ts of drug trading.<br />Thank you fellow noblemen of the 21st century.

				Generally you need someone who already knows the dealer to vouch for your legitamacy, to prove you&#039;re not LE or someone just trying to rip them off. After that it&#039;s pretty straightforward, negotiate the price/quantity and set up a time to meet and exchange. Dead drops are often arranged on larger quantities.

				It usually starts off that your parents used to deal kilos to their grandparents.<br /><br />Rent a hotel room to count money and check out the product. Bring a currency pen, maybe some beer.&nbsp; Populated areas are more safe but if you are worried about safety it might not be a good working relationship. <br /><br />You should never cold call someone. That&#039;s just freaky.

				If you need instructions then you will get robbed or nabbed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Never buy from strangers without checking the goods first .&nbsp; If someone is in a hurry then there is something up.&nbsp; Go slow. Rent a hotel room.&nbsp; Have a beer and count the cash and check for fake bills.<br /><br />Always buy from someone who can be found easily first hand.&nbsp; <br />Biggest thing to watch for is fake bills mixed in.&nbsp; As someone suggested, bring a currency checker device. <br /><br />Ya it smells like pork chops in here .&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I wouldn&#039;t go above a QP for casual sale (in the sense that you contact someone, offer it, and they pay you as you hand it to them)<br />For larger, I&#039;d rely only on people I knew / have known / got into the business with and trust - organize a party, you can easily distribute several lbs to dealers there without people even seeing it happen.<br /><br />If you just want to sell 3 kilos of pot and have cash for it, you should either know someone on good terms who can help you out in that sense. That&#039;s way too much to trust to the honest business sense of strangers.

				Well if it was me i&#039;d know who to sell 3 KGs of weed to no probs :) <br />The dealer will know of youve contacted him, through whatever way you want a quick cash sale below the going rate?<br /><br />If I didnt know the dealer. Id get a sample of the stuff to him first. <br />Get someone the two of yous know and can trust. Get dealer to give the cash to him. <br />Tell dealer where stuff is. Dealer gets stuff. <br />Dealer is happy, tells the person who is holding the cash to release it to you. <br />Everyone is happy. Has to be someone yous both know and trust. <br /><br />For the actual getting the goods to the dealer, id leave it somewhere and let him go get it. <br /><br />PS - why does someone have 3kgs and they are the type of person the dont know who or where to sell it to? <br />

You&#039;d have no problem selling 3kg. Just contact the dealers you know and arrange to meet them somewhere. Talk about it and then if they want it, meet somewhere else at a later date and sell the KG. Pretty simple really. Peope selling those amounts IRL don&#039;t just sell to anyone either. They will only sell to people they have known for a while and know they are a dealer (or extremely heavy user).
