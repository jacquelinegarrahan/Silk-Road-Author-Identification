				Hey Friend! I can&#039;t help you source any mints but I came here to second your request for them. Furthermore if any of you find yourselves near Chicago Il look for a brand of ecstasy pills called Mints. They are a great domestic pill that are very solid. Different colors but always the same shape and consistency.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t had one in a long time. http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=27314 These were the last batch I personally had but they were soooooooo good. DO recommend! I should mention I would usually drop two and snort another half&nbsp; about an hour and a half in. Any one else???

				No offense, but honestly... this sounds kinda sketchy...<br /><br />Plenty of domestic molly, why not just press your own?&nbsp; Why the need to seek out famous sources when you can make presses of similar/better quality yourself? <br /><br />And if Mintman/ cali presses are still &quot;going around right now&quot; like crazy, why don&#039;t you have a hookup?... isn&#039;t the stuff all around?<br /><br />

				<br /><br />+1&nbsp; dirtybiscuitzz718.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One can make their perfect ideal roll as long or as strong as they wish with the selection here. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had the mints and the pokeballs (old and new). In my opinion the mints are a crappy pill (IN MY OPINION!!!). It is a quality synth of chem, but most have to take more than one for them to do good. Crumbly pill. Old poke&#039;s were pretty good. Buy better presses here, mints shouldn&#039;t make you popular.<br /><br />Bottom line you have many other and better choices on here. <br /><br />P.S. I sourced mine on Bluelight from people. They shipped them to me just like SR does. Build a relationship and you&#039;re golden. Whats the worst that will happen, they ban you??? lol<br /><br />I still have the option to get these, but I will not waste my time. <br /><br />(my opinion and my 2 cents)&nbsp; so save any lip about my opinion. Quoting the wise words of&nbsp; dirtybiscuitzz718, &quot;Relax kid&quot;.

				Ok let me put it this way if i did not want to order internationally and wanted decent mdma tabs the only choice i would have is Kwikemarts green bulls which are not a known press and there too expensive. The local scene where i am from is infested with kids selling methylone/ other Rcs and bullshit nobody likes and no tabs/pills at all not even pipes anymore so even if&nbsp; good mdma is sold there caps in general are questioned because of the other capped up bullshit that is provided so if all of a sudden a person comes along with &quot; Mints &quot; or the new M80s or pokes that all these kids hear of or see on pillreports it would be like a gold mine with profit because its the fact that they are already branded and people know about them is what will sell and if you double drop either mints or new cali presses that is plenty for anyone to roll so its is worth it there not that bad of tabs i have had plenty of cali presses even the low dosed ones back in 2010 there pretty good the source has just gone on to do other things and i need another.
