				I remember when some orders from Canada got delayed because they said someone had mailed body parts!<br />Fuck! This world is dark sometimes, and this is just the tip of the ice berg. Statistically speaking, shit like this is probably happening right now! Somewhere in the world someones getting brutally murdered. And just think what went on in medieval times!!! It happened to my best mate, he was murdered, stabbed 82 times and almost fully decapitated&nbsp; :&#039;( That&#039;s why I can&#039;t bring myself to watch shit like this. I&#039;m still interested in who filmed it? It must have been the murderer?

				Yes it is 100% real. They found the torso and identified it. He was caught in Berlin not to long ago. He had made other videos of him torturing and killing animals. The thing that really gets to me is not the fact that he did these things. Because we all knew people have done even worse. BUT now in this era when EVERYTHING gets caught on video we can now see what we have read about for Years. Can you imagine if Jeffery Dahmer had had the internet to post or stream his actions. People watch this for ENTERAINMENT!!! Thats more scary to me than anything. I used to work at a state hospital on the recieving floor. Let me tell ya it is one fucking terrifying night after night with some of the disturbed and sick people that get committed. Once they get their medication right some of them are just like any normal person. If they stop though OMG its frightening as hell. This guy did this shit for his 15 minutes. Now the bar has been raised and you can bet somebody will try and outdo this sick MFer and kill 2 or 3 and who knows what else. Thats why this world to me sux and I&#039;m gonna do drugs and mind my business. Its never gonna get better but just the opposite. All the great empires fell and we are so arrogant to think its not coming for us. BUT humanity will hit reset and start all over again. My best wishes to the family of both because they are the ones who will pay the price from this twisted fuck.

				Wow that was quite a cynical rant about humanity. Who wants to see a weird frolicky Canadian fuck a doughy Chinaman&#039;s corpse and eat him? I&#039;ve had the misfortune of being rick-rolled, goatse&#039;d, and seen a bit of Three Guys One Hammer, shakethatbear, clown porn and Mr. hands. I have seen some shit, and I have no desire to watch that.&nbsp;
