				There&#039;s a thread for for other drug experiences, let&#039;s see what crazy shit comes out of the rabbit hole....<br /><br /><br />I got a gram of MXE a month or so ago and spent the following week using it off and on for its pain relieving and anti-depressant qualities ( I shattered my ankle in a car wreck and painkillers only serve to dull the pain, making walking still bothersome ) and after about two weeks of maybe using little key bumps every now and then to keep me spry I was down to my last point and I wanted to make it a good one.<br /><br />I took the point and waited a couple weeks to lower my tolerance, and then blew the point and waited for *it* to happen.<br /><br />I remember being upstairs at my girlfriend&#039;s apartment, she was sleeping &#039;cause she had an 8 A.M. class in the morning and actually gives a shit about school so I was letting her sleep downstairs. <br /><br />The come-up was gradual, not staggered like I normally feel when I use K - for me, K feels like a roller-coaster while MXE feels more like a smooth drive down a highway. The pain in my foot went away as I was playing Skyrim and I sort of phased into my character, the computer becoming an extension of my body, and I really felt a part of the game, just going around dungeon crawling and such. That lasted for about five or six minutes, and then I could tell something big was going to happen.<br /><br />I wanted to hole while holding my girlfriend for some reason, so I get up off the chair and immediately fall to my feet and forget how to walk for a bit. I thought about the muscles in my leg and how they move against one another to make motion and thinking of the physics of human motion reminded me how to walk.<br /><br />Next came the stairs.<br /><br />FUCK.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been on K a few times, and had a string of DXM induced experiences when I was younger, and stairs have always been my deepest, darkest enemy. If you had saw me go down these stairs you probably would have thought I was some drugged up robotic ballerina trying to tiptoe down them. I had to stop several times because I was afraid I was going to fall.<br /><br />I got down, shambled to the bed my girlfriend sleeping in and she had it on Comedy Central and it was an episode of the Colbert Report where they were talking about Bitcoin and I remember thinking for some reason this was meant to be seen by me. All I could hear before I laid back and succumbed to the hole was &quot;DON&#039;T BUY BITCOIN, DON&#039;T BUY BITCOIN, DON&#039;T BUY BITCOIN&#039; and I closed my eyes and was inside this bleak stark white room with Colbert and the economist he was talking to about bitcoin. They were talking to each other but their words were coming out like &quot;ra ra ra ra ? ra ra ra ra ra? ra ra ra ra RA ra RA?&quot; but I could understand what they were saying perfectly. Then the world went dark and I couldn&#039;t see anything, but I existed, in this formless black void and I remember thinking, &quot;Fuck, so this is what death is like. This is going to be boring as hell.&quot; My consciousness floated around for a while until I saw myself laying next to my girlfriend limp and lifeless, her still asleep and my inner self starts freaking out, like, &quot;You&#039;ve done it now! You&#039;re dead!&quot; and then the void starts spinning and it&#039;s like I&#039;m a tornado tunnelling into myself again.<br /><br />Then I opened my eyes, stumbled to the kitchen and fixed myself a glass of orange juice and wrote down everything that had happened so I wouldn&#039;t forget it.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, I love weird experiences, and as much as I love to trip balls dissociatives most assuredly provide the weirdest experiences I&#039;ve ever had. It was like embracing Thanatos and then casually letting him fuck me in the ass, with a reach-around of course.<br /><br />Hope you folks have some awesome experiences to share too :]

				&quot;Don&#039;t buy bitcoin&quot; LOL!<br /><br />I still can&#039;t stop thinking about my last experience with Zolpidem. Just 1 tablet in the past was really nice so I decided to take 2 tablets (20mg) just before flying back home alone from a holiday, quite literally, my &quot;Ambien Trip&quot; lol! <br /><br />I had not taken any benzos for the majority of the holiday as my fiance&#039;s dad was as usual, force feeding me hard liquor and I know they don&#039;t mix well with alcohol. So instead of smuggling them back again, I thought it best to just have them for the flight.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, I have total amnesia of the whole trip! I can&#039;t remember saying goodbye to my fiance or his dad, going through customs, at either end or even the whole flight! <br /><br />The only reason I found out I had amnesia was because of copious amount of photos and videos I had on my phone. I met nice couple on the aircraft and took some photos of the airports.

I&#039;m generally a very grounded person and not afraid of most drugs, so when I visually hallucinate I know it&#039;s not real but I enjoy it a bunch. Deleriants, psychedelics, and dissociatives abound!

				I&#039;m posting because I&#039;m interested in your ankle haha. I severely sprained mine 2 days ago &amp; I can&#039;t even stand on it. I don&#039;t have health insurance so I&#039;m not quite sure how to diagnose it. I have no clue if its just stretched or torn or fractured/broken. How many days before you were able to walk after shattering your ankle?

How many days before you were able to walk after shattering your ankle?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well I&#039;ll explain the accident first so you have an idea of the extent of my injuries...<br /><br />I ran a stop sign into a main highway and hit another car as it was passing the road I was driving on. The engine block &amp; force of the crash made it so that when I went to slam on the brakes it shattered both bones in my ankle, broke my tibia at the mid-way point between my ankle and my knee, and tore every ligament and tendon connecting my foot to my ankle. Then, in a hazey after-accident fury I opened the door to my car to make sure the other people were okay ( they were ) and stepped down on my foot which moved a lot of the shattered bones out of place.<br /><br />Basically, they had to rebuild my ankle, I&#039;ve got some sort of surgical rope in there to replace the tendons and ligaments and a rod connecting my ankle to the point where my tibia broke.<br /><br />But I would say I started putting weight on it again two months or so after the accident. It took me three weeks to be able to do anything besides piss and eat and sleep. I just sorta laid in bed sick from the meds they gave me ( they gave me fentanyl in the ambulance, then dilaudid all throughout the hospital &#039;cause morphine doesn&#039;t do shit to me, and then when I leave the hospital they have the nerve to put me on 5 mg lortabs. WTF is that shit? ) and watched Breaking Bad for three weeks straight, day in and day out. <br /><br />I walked on crutches for a while, but they&#039;re so fucking unwieldy it pissed me off so I started walking a month before the doctors said it was okay for me to walk, but I&#039;m doing fine now. The only thing that bothers me is the rod in my leg, especially when I trip, because I can feel where it binds my bones together and it unnerves me.<br /><br />I also have a little bit of neuropathy from the accident too ( and the normal wear and tear of Diabetes since I&#039;m a type 1 diabetic ). I can&#039;t feel the top of my right foot. I can feel the toes and all, but about three or four inches in any direction from my ankle I have no feeling. <br /><br />Haha, that whole ordeal is the only reason I ever have &#039;bad&#039; trips - I read a while ago of stimulant users having their feet fall off from vasoconstriction and there gets to be points where my feet feel bad and I worry about them falling off, lol.

				well, that escalated quickly.<br />But seriously, if you started walking in a month, I should be able to walk by tomorrow. I need to start stretching and rehabilitating asap. The swelling has gone down a little bit, but the pain is there. Time to dab and walk!

				I saw that episode of the Colbert Report!<br /><br />All my K trips are fuzzy memories. Ummm do you know the endless lines of green text code over a black background from The Matrix? Well I remember being in this black space within a wave of green 1s and 0s flowing all over and around me haha, twas quite amazing. I also recall a trip that mostly just consisted of Japanese manga cartoons, those visuals were quite boring... actually, probably would of been cool if I like anime/manga but I&#039;m not that into it..../end3amrant<br /><br />
