				I just flushed at least 3 grams of this down the toilet.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have done a bunch&nbsp; of drugs, mostly in the past.&nbsp; I have smoked weed for years and a vendor on here&nbsp; GAVE me about 3.5mg.&nbsp; I have done it a&nbsp; few times and I feel evil from it.&nbsp; It just hit me like a ton of bricks that I should get rid of it.&nbsp; I flushed a jar full down the toilet, along with a bunch of 300 gel pills.&nbsp; I have heard people say that some of these drugs could mess you up for life, well, I just had an epiphany and flushed a bunch of shit that was fucking up my life, I felt evil from this compound.&nbsp; I flushed it along with about 300 gel tabs so no one else would have to feel the effects of this drug.&nbsp; My life has changed tonight.<br /><br />Call me what you will but when God designed this planet,&nbsp; he gave us what we needed or could produce.<br /><br /><br />This has changed my opinion of research chemicals.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is good research, and bad, but if you are like me, don&#039;t mess with with this stuff ever.<br />

				I had dosed a few times that day.&nbsp; Then I did 150 mg, which blew my mind a few days before, almost too much, but late that night, I did 150 and just felt this sense of bad, can&#039;t describe it, come over me and I had to flush&nbsp; the shit.&nbsp; I hope I didn&#039;t fuck up, but I can&#039;t exactly get it back.&nbsp; Oh well.

				You&#039;ll be fine. You just had a bad trip is all. I just came down from MXE as well. I&#039;m completely sober. I took a total of roughly 60mg ~ish. I dosed three times. I only 8 hours laer I&#039;m 100% sober even without an afterglow<br /><br />*shrug*<br /><br />Don&#039;t take too much at once, silly. It can become overpowering.

				Maybe you are right.&nbsp; I liked it before I did like a whole gram in two days. Silly ol&#039; me!<br /><br />Seriously the last evening, I couldn&#039;t complete words or sentences.&nbsp; I could walk like a robot, concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other.

				Haha, I may be sober, but my typng still fails when I&#039;m tired!<br /><br />A gram in two days is a LOT. WAY too much. Limit your dose a little bit and you&#039;ll be fine.
