				If anyone else wants to help fill in the history please do share any stories or info you feel is safe to share and wont piss others off either. Ozfreelancer wants to write something comprehensive about the online drug scene, and I think it is up to the people who lived through it to get her the details it is about time someone told our story

				I think it is also worth pointing out that contrary to popular opinion, the people in the forum scene, including vendors, have always been overwhelmingly in favor of drug legalization. The people who are against it are really exceptional, and I for one consider them to be traitors. A lot of people make money in the mean time, but almost all of us will agree that we do not win when we make a hundred grand or a million dollars, we win when we don&#039;t make any money because the black market for drugs is gone because they are legalized. We are drug users first and drug dealers second in the vast majority of cases, I talk to some pretty big time drug dealers of psychedelics particularly and sure they will make money off of drugs now but almost all of them would prefer legalization to their own profits.

Will this be based on an existing anonymous/encrypted network or a completely new implementation?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Will use Tor for transport between mixes. Pretty much like this:<br /><br />Users select a list of contacts for messages to go to, up to a certain number of contacts (probably thousands).&nbsp; <br />The client automatically encrypts the message for each of the contacts, transparently to the client. <br />The client automatically tags the message with a pairwise shared secret for each of the contacts.<br /><br />Client -&gt; Tor -&gt; Mix 1 -&gt; Tor -&gt; Mix 2 -&gt; Tor -&gt; Mix 3 -&gt; Tor -&gt; Encrypted Keyword Search<br /><br />Contacts periodically query the EKS server for the shared secret message tags, allowing them to get the messages from their contacts. The EKS server does not know which messages the contact searches for or which messages the contact obtains.<br /><br />Contact &lt;-&gt; Tor &lt;-&gt; Encrypted Keyword Search<br /><br />The EKS servers are a cluster that mirror each others content<br /><br />EKS1 &lt;-&gt; EKS2 &lt;-&gt; EKS3 &lt;-&gt; EKS4 &lt;-&gt; EKS5<br /><br />Clients can connect to arbitrary EKS servers to obtain their messages, only one needs to be connected to at a time and they should be largely redundant. Clients sending forward messages can construct arbitrary mix pathes. Messages at mixes are alpha mixed giving clients the ability to select between anonymity and reliability. After a contacts client obtains a message, it automatically decrypts it, organizes it and displays it to the contact. The system can be used for private messaging, group private messaging more similar to chat, leaderless forum structures (which will essentially consist of several group private messages as threads, organized into forum structures client side by a set of rules the user makes) and blogs as well. Will probably have unlinkable contact strings as well as static strings for getting things like public blog pages, and probably even regular keyword search as well for finding arbitrary uploaded content. <br /><br />If you don&#039;t want to get messages from a person you can ignore them entirely and your client wont even download messages they tag for you. You also have total control in who can see the messages you send. If you send a message to people not ignoring you, everyone you select gets the message. <br /><br />Also plan to integrate something like Zerocoin if possible, originally the plan was to have code for centralized blind mixes and let people run them themselves but a distributed trustless blind mixing scheme is superior and Zerocoin has proven that this is possible. Control of Bitcoin will be totally integrated into the client, it will be as if you could click a Bitcoin button on the forum next to a persons avatar and select an amount of coins to send them, but also blinding will be integrated as well to make transactions totally unlinkable. <br /><br />All identities are authenticated and tied to ECDSA-384 keys, all messages are encrypted with ECDH-384 and AES-CTR-256 and all messages going through mixes are layer encrypted with LIONESS. <br /><br />So far the mixing part is done, Tor is interfaced with and networking code is done, the encryption is done and Bitcoin is interfaced with and the GUI is partially done. now it just needs somebody to implement the EKS algorithm, see if something like Zerocoin can be integrated to blind all Bitcoin transactions in a trustless way, and finish up the GUI and client side message sorting algorithms. <br /><br />The big advantage is that it is not for illegal activity. It is for whatever people want to use it for. It is not illegal to run EKS nodes or Mix nodes, and if people use them for illegal things well the people running the infrastructure cannot tell or stop them. Also taking down a single mix node or EKS node will have little to no effect on the ability of the users to continue to operate as before, provided there is a single EKS node and a single Mix node it is still possible to use the system.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I would be interested also on the techniques LE has used in the past if you can share some more stories, it seems they mostly use social engineering/honeypots for infiltration and not so much software security vulnerabilities from what I ve read.

				Very nice write up, kmf.<br /><br />OzFreelancer, if you are writing a book about the online drug world, be sure to research and include JFL, Eleusis, and the usenet scene. JFL may have been the first bust of an online drug vendor. It was certainly the biggest and most noteworthy of its time. Eleusis is a fascinating character, even more than strike in my view:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/eleusis/memoirs.html<br /><br /><br />kmf, so the messaging system you are working on will function as a distributed market? I&#039;m trying to understand how exactly it will function, like vending through email or forums, or like a market with product listings and cart? You say people can click on a name and pay. I&#039;m just don&#039;t understand what it will look like.

JFL, was that the poisonous non-consumables site? That was also before my time, they were one of the first internet vendors though. <br /><br />Astor it will look a lot like a forum. Imagine that there is a Bitcoin icon under Avatars on the forum, like the send a PM button. When you click on it, you can select a number of Bitcoins and hit send, and then Bitcoins are sent from your wallet to the person. You could have product listings by creating a blog, which would essentially be a thread that you can send posts to but others cannot reply to. So you could make all of your product listings and have them posted and be able to update them, people who know about you can download this page without anyone being able to tell they did, then they could use the same system to send you a private message saying they are placing an order and the details of it, click a Bitcoin button and have coins sent to you for the order. And people who are networked together could use the same system to have a thread that anybody can post to and that is related to your services, so they can share reviews with each other.<br /><br />So<br /><br />Blog: A dynamic message referenced by a long term public identifier string, only you can modify the message and anyone with its identifier string can download it, this would be a spot where people could list products if they wanted to<br /><br />PM: A fixed message referenced by an ephemeral shared secret identifier string, Alice tags a message for Bob with a secret one time use identifier shared between Alice and Bob, and this allows Bob&#039;s client to obtain the message after it arrives at a PKS. <br /><br />Group PM: The same as regular PM, but instead of tagging a message with an identifier for Bob, Alice tags it with identifiers for Bob and Carol, and encrypts it so both of them can decrypt it. <br /><br />Forum: The organization of group PM&#039;s into a forum like visual structure, which takes place client side, with each user being the admin of their own perspective of a forum, which itself is crafted using the collection of group PM&#039;s as its&#039; threads. So when you gain access to a group PM discussing Astor&#039;s blog, you can move it to the subforum vendor reviews, which exists entirely client side on your own system, and when you gain access to another group PM discussing the same thing you can merge it into the original group PM, and replies are compartmentalized such that if you respond to a post from the original group PM it only goes to people in the original group PM, and the same for the secondary group PM, but it gives you the impression of a single thread of messages and of participating on a regular forum on which you are the only admin.

				I am going to try to dig up some other old timers to share their stories as well, I am still in partial contact with a few of the core people from back in the day including one of the original members of Hive, they will have good stuff to share as well if I can get in touch with them in time and they want to.

				Eleusis spent a few years in prison but he was released a long time ago. He&#039;s out there somewhere and his real name is easy to find. Just sayin. ;)<br /><br /><br />Bonus points if you can track down Rhodium and get an interview, although there is a very real possibility that the reason he disappeared a decade ago without comment is that he got busted and is serving a long prison sentence.<br /><br />

				The first quasi-open website that I know of in the UK was pepe&#039;s page - a dealer of cannabis imported to the UK from Holland.<br /><br />He was definitely operational in 1999 - I know this because I smoked his charas at the millenium party I attended! His site required a log in but it was widely shared and they let anyone who logged in order without any recommendation system. Busted in 2003.<br /><br />Here is one story from a reputable source: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jan/31/1<br /><br />EDIT - actually I think I am wrong about 1999.

				+1 <br /><br />I came to the SR earlyish and had heard of OVDB starting out, but that history is an informing and captivating read. <br /><br />Most interesting is the progression from &quot;getting high&quot; to being driven enough to research cryptography and create a secure database. And then progression to political and social views as a result of this study. I think many of us can relate to that progression (minus the creation of the database of course!). <br /><br />And it is good to see other veterans chiming in on this thread and seeing that SR members have a farther reaching history than commonly known. <br /><br />Once again, very interesting read, I hope OzFreelancer handles all this info well, which I&#039;m sure she will. <br /><br />DG

				You should also research Euphoric Knowledge, I was never a member there but they were a pretty significant research chemical forum, kind of like an evolution of SL but without any lineage to it. They organized massive group buys of research chemicals where all members would pool their money then one of them would import a kilo of some research chemical and break it up and distribute grams at cost to the people who pitched money in. So they all had access to dirt cheap research chemicals by doing massive group buys in this way, a lot of them got busted in an operation I believe but I was never really part of their group at all. The impression I had of them is that they were mostly young people, it really struck me as a next generation Sandoz Labs except with a lot more members.

				Oh my mistake I thought they sold at cost (or slight mark ups) since everybody was required to pitch in money before the vendor even imported anything. Like I said I was never a member there only checked out their forum a few times and then never went back since they were extremely insecure and had nothing I couldn&#039;t already get. So were they not giving people any price breaks on group buys at all? I was under the impression that their forum largely existed for the goal of organizing group orders so that people could get much cheaper research chemicals than buying grams off of vendors who put money down and imported kilos with their own funds. Seems kind of stupid to send someone money for something they don&#039;t even have and not get a price break, when other vendors already were importing shit with their own funds and selling it by the gram.

				Hm didn&#039;t know any regular illegal forums that went back prior to 2004. I thought SL was pretty much the first forum since Hive and RCML. I heard about one forum that was operated by a very skilled chemist, but they didn&#039;t use the forum for much other than voting on what rare drug he should synth for them. Every six months they had a vote and he synthed a small batch of whatever rare drug people asked him to and sent out doses to everyone. I was never on that forum but I think it went back to before 2004. <br /><br />I left off a lot of forums for sure, pretty much the entire pharmaceutical oriented forums like CHFC OPR and all the other ones related to those hell I cannot even remember their names now. Of course there was also Farmers Market which is now busted, you should read about their history as well oz they go back many years as well. Was also BB but I cannot remember where that one fits in now. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think it matters if I spout off all the old market places I knew about or was a member on, but I can understand not wanting to. The thing is, all the forums I am talking about are so far gone that even if the DEA learns their names and histories they are not going to be able to do shit against them without a time machine. I specifically neglected to mention any forum that is currently running out of respect for their security. Also I have been using anonymity measures consistently for a lot of years now, and have changed my pseudonym and regular contacts so many times that even I cannot remember my old names anymore lol. If they can bust me because of something I have said they would have busted me a long time ago :). Not to mention that I am now hardly involved with anything illegal at all, have a perfectly spotless house more often than not and am only a small time drug user now. Plz feel free to raid me feds, you will find only several thousand lines of source code on my computer :). I determined quite a while ago that I am more valuable to the scene out of jail than in, and have acted accordingly since. Cannot get much better security than not breaking the law ;).

Recently I hardly even use drugs at all and my primary interest is in honing my security skills, and particularly in helping to create a software solution that will separate the infrastructure of the markets from the goal of the markets, allowing for highly secure and leaderless organization and a decentralized trustless infrastructure that can be used by any market or even non-market organization.

				Holy shit, thanks for taking the time to write this. You PMd me to contribute but you&#039;ve written most out of it for me. AP stands for &#039;AuraithX Previously&#039;. After I exposed raters (Canadian opiate/steroid scammer) scams (he would run opiate scams, go legit for a while, then scam all his customers and took in approx 10k each time). He publicly tried to drag my name through the dirt and even though his claims were ridiculous (Apparently I was a German Surfer/DEA rat) there was that much drama going on that people didn&#039;t know what to believe and it was starting to hurt the reputability of the sites I was associated with (undrugged mostly). The RC forums all had a sort of &#039;alliance&#039; (can&#039;t remember the name of any of the other forums) - and there were talks of sending a hitman to rater and I got out. My chemist (I ran a LSD vendor called Lucigenol) also just had 2x2g packages of LSD ($30k) seized. Got a job, and got on with my life.<br /><br />I only skimmed the thread as I seen my name mentioned and got all giddy - but I will go back and read it now. Glad to see what we done was remembered! <br />

				rater probably made several hundreds of thousands of dollars scamming the drug scene, also snitched out several people via doxing and straight up reporting to the police as well. I think he must have made more than 10k per scam on some forums I seem to remember him taking single people for that much.

				Okay, here&#039;s my version of events. I&#039;ll try and be an accurate as possible but with all the moving about we did, name changes, etc it can be hard to remember. I actually always thought I founded FTWR and FTGB after supplier.info but after reading kmfkewm&#039;s post his timeline actually makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />I&#039;ve left a lot out of this post as kmfkewm has already mentioned it, so read the original post first and just slot this in :)<br /><br />I moved back to the UK from America in 2006 (when I was 16). This was my 20th move so I didn&#039;t really have a clue what was going on in school (I had been held back a year in Belgium because I couldn&#039;t speak the language) long story short - I had been brought up to learn in so many countries and fashions that when I tried to jump into 6th year (Equivalent of Senior in America) I ended up failing/not going in for my exams which left me out of school with no qualifications. Me and my friends were starting to experiment with cocaine, and then ecstasy. I ended up taking 42 E&#039;s over the easter weekend. Hospitalised myself, googled what the fuck happened, and found pillreports. The pills were Meth adulterated. I then found bluelight and became an active contributor. After I had been on bluelight for a while I got a PM from a member who went by c00kiemoster. He introduced me to research-chemicals.org where I quickly moved up to a moderator status (I spent a lot of time writing guides for newbies - what else did I have to do?) <br /><br />r-c.org was a good site, we lived there peacefully for a while, trading sources for personal amounts of RCs. I had a fallout with the Admin (I believe I was a moderator or co-admin at the time) - Can&#039;t remember why, I believe it was something to do with me wanting to make the site more secure.<br /><br />Some other members felt the same, we broke off and created FTWR/FTGB (We would try and switch domains every few months to avoid LE). But these sites were too small, and not getting enough activity. So I figured, I&#039;ll just be 100% secure and create a public sourcing forum. I got in touch and found some Russian host who said I could host anything but child porn, which was fine. supplier.info exploded, I believe at it&#039;s peak we had around 500 active members. Unfortunately, due to an open-entry system rater created dozens of shills on this site. I noticed weird behavior on the opiate forums, a vendor would be legit for months, and months, and then eventually go scam and take in tens of thousands. The Admin (rater) was a complete psychopath. I posted a topic publicly outing him and spread the word around our forums, hipforums, bluelight, etc - He did not like this. He came at me with everything he had, must&#039;ve spent weeks trying to DOX me. Got close a few times but never got my info 100% correct as I would spread misinformation (registering the site to random addresses in other countries, making up stories, etc). He found out one of my senior members (Glock34) correct details (he was an opiate user and had ordered from one of raters scams) and ratted him out to the DEA kmfkewm will probably remember more about this, I can&#039;t remember what he got caught with but I&#039;m pretty sure he got a few years. <br /><br />kmfkewm got involved in the forum and was obviously more clued up than the majority of us on security, he was a moderator at first and then I eventually promoted him up to co-admin and we forced our members to be secure. Making a PGP key a mandatory field in your forums profile, telling people to use Tor, writing newbie guides on how to be safe and scolding anyone who disagreed. I ran a middle-man LSD vendor (Lucigenol) selling sheets at the time (I didn&#039;t touch product, I got funds via egold, WU, MG, LR&nbsp; and then got it to my chemists money-man in America and he would ship it out). I&#039;m not sure how much acid I sold but I made probably about $30,000? Plenty for someone unemployed at 18/19<br /><br />Rater was still causing a shitstorm at this time, and really creating a lot of confusion in the scene. It got to a point where genuinely smart people (not shills) didn&#039;t know who to believe because there was so much nonsense flying about. I imagine this was his plan the entire time. He must&#039;ve spent hours on end trying to discredit me, it was ridiculous. Some of the stuff is still floating about:<br /><br />**clearnet warning**<br />https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.drugs.ghb/1zFHM_Il5gE/jLB_nkkf8qQJ<br /><br />This was a dreadful time in the scene, no one trusted each other, people were getting ratted out, and raided. It got that bad that one of the members of the alliance had access to hitmen, we pretty much figured out who rater was by DOXing him. I didn&#039;t really want to be involved in that shit, luckily I got offered a Data-Entry position at a publishing company, took that, and weaned myself out of the scene. AFOYI was the last forum I was on, I deleted Tor and decided to go straight. 4 years on and I&#039;m and IT &amp; Web Development Specialist - came back last week as someone was pestering me for some acid and here we are.<br /><br />I too, am an Agorist/Mutualist. I was very skeptical at first but kmfkewm got me onto an Agorist IRC chatroom. These are some very smart people (these are the kind of places bitcoin was invented - I was tempted to buy bitcoin at $0.10/btc when they were first starting to come out) It took me a full year of questions before I redefined my political stance. It&#039;s not something you can come to overnight. But once you realise that all violence is illegitimate unless it&#039;s self-defense - it becomes much clearer. The feeling is similar to finding out santa is not real or that all dogmatic religions are are a farce. It&#039;s pointless getting into an agorist debate in this thread, you will not change your view unless you&#039;re willing to. <br /><br />

				Yeah rater was pretty much psychotic, or at least acted like it. Pretty much none of what he said was true. He spent his entire life on the internet posting psychotic rants such as the following, as well as running scam forums. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">LOOKS LIKE AURAITHX- THE TARD FROM GLASCOW FOUND A NEW PARTNER- A FITTING<br />NEW PARTNER- SHROOMINNJ/HOTCHILLI<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No idea who Shroominnj or Hotchilli are but I highly doubt they were involved with su.pplier or I would remember them<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">WANNABE SCAMMER AND GENERAL PIECE OF SHIT.<br /><br />SU.PPLIER.INFO WAS REGISTERED UNDER SCAM SITE Tbwse.org WHICH WAS REGISTERED<br />BY....YOU GUESSED IT..SHROOMINNJ<br /><br />&quot;Registrant ID:DI_8173914<br />Registrant Name:George Smith<br />Registrant Organization:TBSWE Inc<br />Registrant Street1:25 River Road<br />Registrant Street2:<br />Registrant Street3:<br />Registrant City:Phillipsburg<br />Registrant State/Province:New Jersey<br />Registrant Postal Code:08865<br />Registrant Country:US<br />Registrant Phone:+1.9089952544<br />Registrant Phone Ext.:<br />Registrant FAX:<br />Registrant FAX Ext.:<br />Registrant Email:<br />Admin ID:DI_8173914&quot;<br /><br />SO AURAITHX SHILL/SCAMMER AND GENERAL LOSER AND DEAD BEAT HAS A NEW SCAMMING<br />SITE TO COMPLIMENT SCAM SITE RESEARCH-CHEMICALS.ORG AND UNDRUGGED.ORG.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No idea about where or how the su.pplier server was registered, I think AP was made a mod on undrugged but it originated from people on Bible. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">THE TOP TWO SOURCES ON SCAM SITE SU.PPLIER.INFO:<br /><br />BIGGERBEN69 AND<br />RY...@CYBER-RIGHTS.NET<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think both of them got busted on DZF, forgot about those guys.

Not sure what happened to him, lost touch with him some years ago. Rater hated him quite a lot as well. <br /><br />I managed to largely avoid the wrath of Rater thankfully, he knew about me but for some reason barely ever tried to attack me. He also would have had no luck getting my real life info as I have been working with mostly the same people I have been since I was on Bible primarily, and other than that only a few other very trusted people. My circle of connections is tight knit and we go way back, so I never worried much about rater getting my real info. I also was using fake ID boxes since the stat of su.pplier anyway.<br /><br />We got raters real info because of a certain vendor who was pretty clever. Now rater kept spamming the shit out of this vendors contact info even though he was a private vendor, and the vendor couldn&#039;t figure out which of his customers was spamming the address. So he made a new E-mail for every customer of his and waited for rater to spam it, at which point he identified who rater was. We got his real info in this way, or at the very least the real info of someone it is possible rater had stolen an identity and opened a box under the name but it is unlikely. I can&#039;t remember his info, probably someone still has a copy of it though, he was some guy in Canada though as we already knew. He was spamming some of our members info and did get some of them busted or forced them to retire at least, we started spamming his info for a while to counter it. For a while people were really getting doxed left and right probably at least a dozen of our members got doxed as well as some of the members on allied forums such as lanel and OS. I think sup actually had 600 members at its peak but then we did a big prune and removed afew hundred of them. Later on some of the members in the council (of BBS) wanted to send a hitman to kill rater after we got his info but I don&#039;t think anybody ever did kill him. We had two people who had access to hitmen, one in Europe and one in USA, so we could have people killed but never did and a lot of us were quite against the idea as well (for example AP left pretty quickly after that proposal, which was rejected, was made). The people who became involved entirely through the internet didn&#039;t tend to have ties to traditional organized crime, but two of our members had connections to traditional criminal networks including a large trafficking organization in NL as well as one in the USA, and these are the people who brought up talk of hitmen and had ability to obtain such services, pretty much everybody else was uncomfortable with the idea, although nobody really had a lot of pity for rater we mostly didn&#039;t want to become a cartel. <br /><br />

				I remember BiggerBen96 and ryork@cyber-rights.net (not quite right but something like that).&nbsp; Both were scammers.&nbsp; BiggerBen69 was always in the steroid scene and on those boards.&nbsp; You can still find him on steroid and body building forums.&nbsp; He vended heroin and some other things from a hushmail email (biggerben69@hushmail.com if I remember correctly) about five or six years ago and scammed all of his customers not long after that.<br /><br />I remember the name AuraithX but I don&#039;t remember anything about it.

				I have no idea if they scammed or not, they were definitely on su.pplier but just as we had lots of vendors. I think they both got busted on DZF and turned informant. The entire pharmaceutical scene has always been full of sketch balls and scammers and snitches, ryork was a big pharm vendor BB had meth and heroin and oxy I think. I think BiggerBen actually did scam people but I thought ryork was legit up to the point that he got pwnt by the feds and turned informant. Anyway I was never involved with that particular cluster fuck group of people short of their presence on some forums I was on, and I don&#039;t have good enough memory to recall what happened. But even if both of them scammed rater was still completely and entirely full of shit and most certainly the biggest scammer in the drug scene ever.

				BB69 definitely went rogue.&nbsp; He is still active on body building forums under the same username to this day though.<br /><br />Remember the guy who sold kilograms of pure morphine?&nbsp; That is the biggest scam that I know of.&nbsp; He makes tony76&#039;s scam look like a joke.&nbsp; His customers were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on single orders and then he quit shipping product one day.&nbsp; The name he went by started with a B. ;)

				I cannot remember the name but I know who you are talking about. That was a rater scam. Rater ran all kinds of opiate scams, he actually did have legit access to boat loads of pharmaceuticals. He would sell them for six months or so legit and then BAM hit people for massive amounts of money and vanish. Same thing happened many times, he always would use a different vendor name and a different forum etc. One of the names he used was 2X4 that is the only one I can remember but there were like a dozen. TorontoJew was another actually. Yeah I think he made probably over a million dollars scamming honestly, AP said he made $10k per scam but I think he actually made way more than that because I remember single people being ripped off for $40,000+.<br /><br />Ah I remember now was it Borat? He also ran MapleSyrup and The Hydro Guy.

				The reason E snitched on Nalbano was over a large package of money that either was cut open and had the money stolen from it en route or that Nalbano just sent him an empty package to begin with. It was a bad move on his part to snitch on Nalbano though, because Nalb just snitched right back on him after he got arrested. So E pretty much resulted in his own arrest by snitching on somebody else. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">GAINESVILLE, GA. - L&#039;Houssain Mahdioui, 37, of Amsterdam, Netherlands, was sentenced today by Senior United States District Judge William O’Kelley to federal prison on charges of conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine and the importation of LSD into the United States. Mahdioui, who was extradited to the United States to face sentencing today, was the final defendant to be sentenced in the case code-named Operation Dutch Connection. A second defendant involved in the drug scheme is already serving a federal prison sentence.<br /><br />“This case speaks to the importance of international law enforcement cooperation. DEA has a robust foreign presence in a number of countries,” said Rodney G. Benson, Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Atlanta Field Division. “In this case, that cooperation led to the successful extradition and prosecution of this international poly-drug trafficker.”<br /><br />“We continue to see drugs come into our communities from other countries, but the drug pushers need local sources and distributors to help do their dirty work. It is extremely difficult for local and state authorities to find and arrest the real sources of such drug distribution networks thousands of miles away,” said United States Attorney Sally Quillian Yates. “In this case, an extensive international investigation and an extradition was necessary to cut off the flow of LSD, ecstasy and other dangerous drugs to our area. A successful fight against those who import illegal drugs into our country requires cooperation not only at the federal, state and local level, but also with our international law enforcement counterparts.”<br /><br />“The U.S. Postal Service has no interest in being the unwitting accomplice to anyone using the U.S. mail to distribute illegal drugs. Postal Inspectors primary objectives are to rid the mail of illicit drug trafficking, preserve the integrity of the mail and, most important, provide a safe environment for postal employees and the American public.” said Martin D. Phanco, Postal Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division.<br /><br />Mahdioui was sentenced to 11 years, three months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, and fined $3,000. Mahdioui was convicted of these charges on October 27, 2010, upon his plea of guilty. Mahdioui also agreed to forfeit $70,000 to the United States that was seized by Dutch officials at the time of his arrest.<br /><br />Co-conspirator Nicholas Albano III, of Gainesville, Georgia, was sentenced on February 12, 2010, to eight years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. Nicholas Albano III, pleaded guilty on November 3, 2009, to charges of possession with the intent to distribute ecstasy, using a communication facility to facilitate drug trafficking, and receiving child pornography.<br /><br />According to United States Attorney Yates, the charges and other information presented in court: In 2008 DEA received information from an anonymous source in the Netherlands using the alias of “John the Dutchman,” who claimed that Albano was obtaining drugs via the U.S. mail and distributing drugs from his residence in Gainesville. Based on this information, DEA agents and postal inspectors conducted an investigation, and obtained and executed a search warrant on Albano’s residence in Gainesville. While attempting to make entry into Albano’s residence, Albano obtained a firearm and attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. Emergency medical crews immediately began attempting to treat Albano. During a search of his residence, agents seized, among other things, LSD, MDMA, psilocin mushrooms and marijuana. Agents also seized several images depicting child pornography from Albano’s computer.<br /><br />Albano survived the single gunshot wound to his head and ultimately agreed to cooperate with law enforcement. Based on Albano’s cooperation and several related investigations, agents learned that “John the Dutchman” was in reality Mahdioui, and that Mahdioui was himself one of the international sources from whom Albano obtained drugs. The investigation revealed that Mahdioui disclosed Albano’s drug trafficking activities to law enforcement because of a dispute over drug money owed by Albano to Mahdioui. The investigation further revealed that Mahdioui, based in the Netherlands, had recruited Albano and others in the United States, via internet chat rooms, to act as distributors or “re-shippers” of drugs to U.S. based customers that had ordered drugs via the internet.<br /><br />In May 2009, working with the authorities in the Netherlands, federal agents in Atlanta set up an international undercover sting operation. Agents in Atlanta communicated with Mahdioui via e-mail and ordered 1,000 hits of LSD, at a price of $5,000, to be shipped to a post office box in the United States. Following Mahdioui’s instructions, agents sent the money, and law enforcement agents from the Netherlands conducted surveillance as Mahdioui picked up the money from a mail facility in the Netherlands. Mahdioui acknowledged receipt of the money via e-mail and several days later sent the agents the LSD.<br /><br />Within a month, in June 2009, agents arranged for a second shipment of LSD to the United States, but arranged with Dutch authorities to arrest Mahdioui prior to the drugs being sent. A search of his residence in the Netherlands revealed 17,000 hits of LSD, 400 tablets of ecstasy, and $70,000 in U.S. currency. Mahdioui was extradited to the United States to face charges on August 27, 2010.<br /><br />This case was investigated by the Strike Force along with Inspectors from the United States Postal Inspection Service, with assistance from IRS-Criminal Investigation and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), under the umbrella of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force.<br /><br />Assistant United States Attorneys Bret Williams, Scott Hulsey and Dahil Goss prosecuted the case.<br /><br />DEA Atlanta Special Agent in Charge Benson encourages parents, along with their children, to educate themselves about the dangers of legal and illegal drugs by visiting DEA’s interactive websites at www.justhinktwice.com, www.GetSmartAboutDrugs.com and www.dea.gov.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Recently I hardly even use drugs at all and my primary interest is in honing my security skills, and particularly in helping to create a software solution that will separate the infrastructure of the markets from the goal of the markets, allowing for highly secure and leaderless organization and a decentralized trustless infrastructure that can be used by any market or even non-market organization.
