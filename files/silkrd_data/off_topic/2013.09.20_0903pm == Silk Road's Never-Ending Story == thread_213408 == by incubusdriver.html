				Just for fun, why don&#039;t we start a never-ending story?<br /><br />Some rules:<br /><br />1. One post at a time, a story will be written<br /><br />2. Before posting your entry, please read the rest of the story so that it all makes at least SOME sort of crazy sense<br /><br />3. Don&#039;t post single sentences... but try not to write an essay either<br /><br />4. Don&#039;t post anything other than the next part of the story - if you don&#039;t like the idea, then instead of jumping in with &quot;what a load of bullcum&quot;, simply ignore the thread and hope to the gods it dies a natural death<br /><br />OK, the first person to think &quot;hey, this is a good idea&quot; gets to set the scene. Let&#039;s go :-)

				(This is quite long but I figured a scene setter might as well be... - Enjoy! xo)<br /><br />Liberio sat at the beach bar on his evening off work in his plastic flip flops, pink flower-covered shorts and a string vest, surrounded by red-nosed drunken idiots slurring and arguing with each other over nothing in particular as he looked out over the dark sea in the distance. <br /><br />The stars&#039; reflection twinkled on the water and he sighed a heavy weighty sigh of a man with 99 problems. <br /><br />Clearly, he&#039;d been ripped off by that ratty street dealer who hung out under the neon sign near the sex shop up the road and the two so-called molly caps he&#039;d plugged with some difficulty in the bathroom stall as a couple had loud sex in the next booth must have been paracetamol. <br /><br />He curled his finger at the boxum, blonde California surfer girl bar tender - the same digit that had just thirty minutes before been knuckle deep in his rectum - and signaled that he wanted his cocktail refilled. She simply looked at him and returned moments later with a fresh tequila sunrise and, plopping in a paper umbrella with a knowing wink, pushed the glass across the bar to him. <br /><br />&quot;I put some liquid LSD in there&quot; she purred in her friend&#039;s ear, once out of earshot from him. &quot;That guy&#039;s always been a belligerent know-it-all and look at how dirty his fingernails are, this should lighten him up a little...&quot; she folded her arms across her chest with an air of satisfaction and watched him with a wry smile curling across her features.<br /><br />Liberio stirred the contents of his glass and as he did so, popped the last two remaining molly caps in his mouth and swallowed hard, along with half his drink. <br /><br />Suddenly the music snapped into focus and the world seemed really clear. He felt a rush go through his entire body, it was so intense he nearly fell off his stool and he had to grasp the bar top to steady himself. He could hear loud laughing coming from a gaggle of girls and yet couldn&#039;t work out why, who or where they were. The sea was crashing in the background and the stars started exploding on its surface like a million white fireworks. <br /><br />It was at this moment he realized that the pills he&#039;d plugged before were working after all and fuck, they were strong. And now he&#039;d double dropped the other two and little did he know that the barmaid had given him an almighty dose of LSD as well. <br /><br />All he knew was... he wanted lots of filthy sex and to dance and he staggered to his feet and ripping off his vest he started to swing it in circles above his head, his hips snaking in what he considered to be a sexual mating ritual, then he closed his eyes and grooved to the steady beat in his head.<br /><br />This was going to be some trip...<br /><br />

				The unshaven fellow just a few feet away, was watching Liberio&#039;s antics in astonished disbelief.<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t understand&quot; he explained to the single-breasted prostitute he&#039;d paid 100 euros to sit with him for the night in some sort of pathetic attempt to make himself appear heterosexual. &quot;I sold him non-prescription painkillers... he shouldn&#039;t be having a, a... a good time!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh babe&quot; grunted his companion in a thick eastern-European accent voice laced with disinterest. &quot;I give you horny time, no?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Shut up, bitch&quot; spat the drug dealer nastily. &quot;I think I gave him my own stash!&quot;
