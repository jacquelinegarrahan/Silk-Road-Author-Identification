				Hey everybody,&nbsp; I&#039;d find it interesting to discuss about drugs and drugs prices compared to the silkroad in the places you live.<br />I am from South America and as far as I know my country is a consumer, producer and exporter of drugs (at least that&#039;s what some of the media said)<br />-What sparked my curiosity and intention of making this thread was the price of marihuana here, they sell it pressed, a little rock that weights 25 grams for 12 dollars (illegal )/ 19 dollars (legal) *, <br />I can&#039;t give opinion on quality because I only did marihuana three times, once mixed with alcohol and the others only a couple of tokes/puffs. It is also socially accepted, not sure about the law.<br />-I heard that cocaine is cheaper but have absolutely no idea how much it costs or the quality. This one is very popular here.<br />-Acid, here we call the blotters &quot;pepa&quot; so as far as I know no one sells it as LSD but asking friends who bought they all reported things as strong taste and other nBomes qualities, and the price varies from 6/9 u$d to 12/18 u$d&nbsp; &nbsp;EACH one.<br />-XTC pills&nbsp; I know that some are pressed here since LE seized a lab not long ago, many reports on local forums give as result a large variety of pills without Mdma but substitutes, acquaintances pay 5/8 u$S for DC which doesn&#039;t have Mdma and 8/11 u$S for Apples that I think are MDMA. People who I know in person have NO idea what is MDMA or mephedrone or even LSD they call the drug by its street name and thats all..<br />-Amphetamine(? there is one more drug that is sold massively and &quot;cheap&quot;, here they sell something that&#039;s street name is &quot;Paco&quot; and there is really not much scientific information about it, and since it is a drug that is only made here and in Brazil there are lots of media misinformation and urban myths about it, such as its cut with broken glass, kerosene, its made from the leftovers of coke, etc.. The only legit info i could find was a report from a lab test (on the news, couldn&#039;t find the actual report) that they made in a university here, it has Cocaine alkaloids, amphetamine, and baking soda. This drug is the problem drug in this country because it is extremely cheap, it is sold for less than a dollar and is like the Crack or Meth in the US. (the stereotypical junky) However judging by the effects it has I&#039;d say is basically amphetamine even though people often say its high lasts minutes and addicts take lots of doses throughout the day but that is what the media says. The dose is said to be from 10 to 30 mg and it is smoked through a hollow metal pipe or pen in most cases.<br />The prices are what friends and acquaintances pay, I myself never had a dealer. Don&#039;t know anyone who uses paco besides a very famous musician.<br />Other drugs are extremely rare only mentioned in online forums and not part of the culture.<br />*the trade of foreign currency is very regulated here since the last year, so if you want to get hold off dollars you have to buy them overpriced that&#039;s why there are 2 prices.

				The marihuana you&#039;re familiar with (typically spelled &#039;marijuana&#039; in the US) is probably hash, which is, as you said, pressed (and heated) to become very compact. 25 grams for 12 dollars is quite a deal though. If you want to hook that up on SR, just let me know. ;P

				Australia - <br /><br />Cocaine - $300-$400 a gram , rubbish quality people don&#039;t even bother.<br /><br />Meth - $50 a point which equals $500 a gram , Rubbish once you have had OS stuff<br /><br />Don&#039;t have experience on many other stuff , pills vary and are just amphetamine no mdma. Biggest drug usage per capita here in Australia but we have the worst quality of drugs you could find anywhere.

				Here in the UK an ounce (28grams) of green is usually between £180 ($270) and £240 ($360). Very little of this is medicinal grade or A+ quality, it&#039;s what many would refer to as mids. Anything half decent will be at the top end. The lower end of those prices is usually for &#039;home-grown&#039; which just means poor weed generally. Most are heavy on the stalks/sticks and the weed is quite thin and patchy, certainly no dense buds. Often this is so sticky it&#039;s impossible to grind or even get out of the bag. Basically it&#039;s crap grown by amateurs that just want some quick cash.<br />You can see why so many UK users of SR discuss foreign vendors because they hugely undercut prices while delivering much higher quality.<br /><br />Although I don&#039;t use coke myself I know people who do. It averages about £50 ($75) a gram but the street stuff over here is rarely even 20% cocaine. Some reports put it as low as 5%.
