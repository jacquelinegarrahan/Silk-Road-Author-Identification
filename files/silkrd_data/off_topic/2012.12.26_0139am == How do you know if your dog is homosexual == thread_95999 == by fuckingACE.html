				Basically, <br />&nbsp;I went to an end of the world rave on friday and at one point during the night I went back to the car with a french girl to have a line of K and there was this white dog trying to fuck my male great dane. Now hes only 10 months old so maybe he dosen&#039;t quite comprehend how things work in the doggie world with regards to making baby doggies. But it kinda looked like he thought it was a game or something, he looked a bit perplexed but then carried on like wanting to play with this other dog. Needless to say I got the extendable baton out and chased the fuck out of the white dog.. Now I wont love my great dane any less even if he turns out to be a raging homosexual with a penchant for dogging at raves.. excuse the pun.. But yes, the question is, can guy dogs be gay, and if they are what behaviors other than the trying to mount &amp; be mounted by other guy dogs can you look out for. Its hard with dogs cause I dont think a dog can be camp and give it away. Also it being a great dane It would be kinda embarrassing if at the park one day he tries to drill a poodle to death. So my other question is, if he does turn out to be that way inclined, can you teach a gay dog to be straight

				Now this is an interesting subject.&nbsp; My dog growing up (big ass 140 lb mutt male)&nbsp; he always liked this one female dog in the neighborhood, but every so often male dogs would mount him and he didn&#039;t seem to have a problem with it.&nbsp; He was a big ass dog who could have clearly gotten away or trampled them, but he seemed to enjoy it.&nbsp; I always thought I had a gay dog, cause basically he liked it in the butt.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dont get me wrong I loved that dog, but he was defiantly weird and was gay or bisexual, but Idk if gay is a thing with dogs or if dogs are just horny.&nbsp; I used to live very close to a dog park and went at least once usually 2x a day and I&#039;ve seen so much weird dog shit, i just think they are horny fucks and the concept of gay and straight isnt a thing.<br /><br />Now I have a female dog, she doesnt mount others, and she loves attn from male dogs (mainly the chase, but ive seen her enjoy a mount).&nbsp; Shes definatly a girl.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to take her from the park because the guy dogs get too rapey and then theres a 10 dog gang bang and thats my little girl, u kno.&nbsp; but its weird, I dont know if sexuality comes into play for dogs, but I&#039;m pretty sure my dog growing up was gay.<br /><br />Id be interested to hear from someone with animal pyscology or a vet or someone who knows the answer better than me or some shit, either way thats my 2 cents<br />penny<br />

				Before we sold our female white german shephard, our female yorkshire terrier used to, when in season (and clearly horny), mount our german shephard and start humping her... Just like a male dog with a dick. I guess she was trying to pleasure herself by rubbing on my other dogs back. Either that or she thinks she&#039;s a dude...<br /><br />The german shephard just used to lay there and let her get on with it, and never did anything &quot;horny&quot; in return.<br /><br />The german shephard did enjoy eating the terriers&#039; shit though... And my little brothers turd when he was young and &quot;couldn&#039;t hold it in any longer&quot; when the bathroom was being used (haha).<br /><br />Dogs are fucking weird.

				But yeah, I agree with penny... I think dogs are just horny. I don&#039;t think they have &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;straight&quot;.<br /><br />I always assumed my terrier only did what she did because there were no dude dogs around. If she had the choice I&#039;m sure she&#039;d go for the cock. I think.

				did the white dog have crystal meth and poppers? usually the first sign of canine homosexuality.<br /><br />my mate has got a gay cat actually, follows his other cat around which is male but blanks any female cats.

				Consider canine hierarchy. Likely the white dog was several years old and the alpha male of the local strays/house pets. Or alpha female. Dogs are weird.

				The humping isn&#039;t just about reproduction to dogs, it is also about dominance. Additionally, if your dog isn&#039;t fixed and not getting its nut off somewhere then it is going to hump just about anything it can find.<br /><br />Watch some Dog Whisperer.

				Yeah dominance makes sense with my case. My german shephard was the most laid back, easy going, care-free, friendly dog in the world... but the terrier has always been a power hungry bossy bitch, and was definitely the alpha dog between the two (even though she was less than half the size).<br /><br />Dogs are fucking weird.
