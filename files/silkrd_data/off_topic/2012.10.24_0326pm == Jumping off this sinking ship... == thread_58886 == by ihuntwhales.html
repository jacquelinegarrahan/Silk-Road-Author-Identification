				Shit is hitting the fan here in the U.S.A. Well, everyone knows it. Anyone who doesn&#039;t is either ill-informed or in denial. It&#039;s been mathematically proven that there is no way to pay off the national defecit without a solution that will cause pain for every American citizen.&nbsp; Our politicians are borrowing money like there&#039;s no tomorrow, but the fact is that the deficit will reach over 20 trillion dollars in the next ten years if this spending does not cease. Do the research, it won&#039;t. In order to get yearly spending out of the red while keeping all social entitlements financed (Social Security, Medicare, ect.) the entirety of the federal government would have to shut down, literally. That means security (Military, FBI, ect) and non-security (Education, Energy, ect) sectors. Don&#039;t take my word on it, do some research, you&#039;ll see the numbers are staggering. You thought Greece was bad? Just wait.<br /><br />So, since I have not been an active part in creating this mess, I do not feel personal responsibility to go down with this sinking ship. Some might not agree with that mindset, as there are people who will share this imminent burdon and are also not to blame. The fact is that the majority of Americans are insolent, self-entitled, arrogant sheep. The fact of &quot;America is the greatest country ever, always, no matter what&quot; has been drilled into their heads throughout their lives, and no amount of factual data or common sense will ever dislodge their incompetent view of our country and the world. That being said, I have two very general questions that I would appreciate answers to, in as much detail as your knowledge base allows you to answer...<br /><br />One, investing. Obviously US treasury bonds aren&#039;t on the list of potential top earning investments that I could be making at this time. For any of those involved in the stock market, where do you plan to put your money? Also a suggestion on quality brokerage services (not full-time) would be wonderful.<br /><br />Second, relocation. I have no interest in living in the U.S past the next five years, due to the current state as well as a desire to experience a different part of the world. That being said, which countries would you suggest to my consideration to relocate? Preferably countries with a more humanitarian stance in the political scheme of things. Also taking into account social, environmental, and financial aspects.

				The stock market is highly manipulated, I would never invest in any securities (stocks, bonds, option, etc) unless I was the one doing the manipulation.<br />I can&#039;t believe so many fools play this game while the financial co&#039;s take their money and laugh all the way to the bank.<br />Same goes for forex trading, forget it.<br /><br />Real estate is a good bet though, again as the adage goes.. buy low sell high, there&#039;s no guarantee of coming out in profit<br />but at least you won&#039;t lose all of your money, its a tangible investment, and you can collect rent.<br /><br />

				My plan for when SHTF is to pack up a shipping container with a Boston wailer, Ford Ranger and enough building supplies to make myself a house in the Solomon Islands.<br /><br />So when everything goes wrong I&#039;ll be hanging out on the beach living life far away from the troubles of modern society

				The world is flat dude, I think christopher columbus said, there is nowhere for you to move. walk to the edge of the earth and jump off is your best bet.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know when this article was written http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/2012-earths-poles-shifting.htm<br /><br />but in case they have not noticed, when they said &quot; If a large pole shift could happen suddenly, the redistribution of land and water it caused would be nothing short of cataclysmic. In the short term, it would mean earthquakes, strange weather patterns, massive tsunamis capable of drowning parts of continents, and possibly gaps in the planet&#039;s magnetic field -- our shield against harmful cosmic rays. In the long term, the redistribution of land and water in the tropics, subtropics and poles would fundamentally alter ocean currents and the heat balance of the Earth, resulting in widespread climatological shifts. Ice caps might melt and reform elsewhere, or remain melted, driving sea levels down or up. &quot;<br /><br />well duh, isn&#039;t that happening now ! ? yes, it is. changes in the earths magnetic field is why birds and sea animals are dying, because they have a built in compass and it&#039;s failing because of this. <br /><br />I will now refer you to here http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=56724.0<br /><br />unfortunately for us, these days &quot; jumping ship &quot; means leaving earth all together. You can fix the national deficit if you wanted to, but there is no fixing whats going on with the planet. you have no where to go.

				I&#039;m well aware of the volatile state that our planet is in right now, but that&#039;s a whole different thread. My question was meant to pertain more towards finding a more suitable area to live in, not so much doomsday prevention, but simply a more liberal and welcoming area than the United States. Hopefully one in a better financial state, as well.<br /><br />I was expected individuals to hype their own home country up in some way or another, but doomsday replies work just as well haha.

				well it sounded like you were looking for safe haven, my answer was........ they don&#039;t exist anymore. anywhere you go will be fucked up.

				Most brokerages in the US underperform the DOW, fuck them all. I recommend The Motley Fool at www.fool.com. Proven track-record, value oriented long-term investing built to last. No &quot;Hot Stock of the Week&quot; shit.<br /><br />As for living. Depends on whether you prefer social stability/security vs. less taxes/regulations. You&#039;d have to elaborate...

				Having worked with investments for the past 15 years I might be able to shed some light on your idea. Investing is a really broad term and encompasses a great deal, you need to know what sort of time frame your looking at, capital, associated risk, capital gains tax etc etc. One thing I advised all clients to do is RESEARCH. Look at the performance of the 401k, compare to that of a common commodity and draw your own conclusion, some of the best investment products out there are ones that are not publicised, usually because the brokerage promoting the investment gets a lower commission. The financial world is full of cut throat businessmen willing to do anything for their next bonus. An interesting film, just for common knowledge is &quot;Inside Job&quot;, it explains why the world crashed, why we&#039;re in a recession and why no one went to jail.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=58886.msg543401#msg543401">Quote from: 3r3 on October 24, 2012, 03:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The stock market is highly manipulated<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would completely agree with 3r3, I often hear through friends of friends that a stock WILL go up about 3-4 months before it does, you can usually pin it down to a 2 week period, though this mainly happens with smaller more volatile companies.

Not because everyone is suddenly going on camping trips, no, but because so many people in the US cant afford their mortgages so instead, they camp out in tent cities which are springing up all across America.

				Get you a copy of James Rickard&#039;s Currency Wars.&nbsp; Interesting stuff!<br />Been in metals and miners since 2008.. I don&#039;t have a plan to leave in time (it will get much harder to get out as time goes on) unless my business takes off and if the new businesses are successful.. a lot of work ahead of me for that to happen, but sometimes it&#039;s hard to really get motivated.&nbsp; If I could I&#039;d get a second passport immediately.&nbsp; I mean.. I could, but it would ruin my chances for the big payoff.&nbsp; I think they can kick the can at least another year, maybe as many as three.&nbsp; But who knows really?&nbsp; I do think gold will be at least $2500 in 2013, with eventual prices over $8000 ..and if full confidence is lost, well it won&#039;t matter what the number is.<br /><br />some good sites to read:<br />kingworldnews.com<br />sovereignman.com<br />jsmineset.com (I have a bunch of Sinclair&#039;s company, Tanzanian Royalty Exploration)<br />zerohedge.com<br />facebook.com<br /><br />No wait, scratch that last one, unless you&#039;re just looking to waste time which you do not have&nbsp; ;D<br />
