				I just put down a deposit for a tandem skydive in a few weeks. So excited I can&#039;t contain myself. Me and 4 friends are going, it was going to be 5 but turns out they have a weight limit of 200 lbs so one of them was too fat to go.<br /><br />Has anyone else been skydiving?! TELL ME HOW AWESOME IT WAS!! <br /><br />I&#039;d love to hear some experiences. I&#039;ve been watching video after video on youtube about it. I just don&#039;t understand how people breathe with the air going those speeds at their face with no mask! But I guess it works out...

				Ahhhh I hadn&#039;t even THOUGHT about doing it while under the influence of something! But part of me wants to do it clear headed to get the full experience sober. I don&#039; know though... I&#039;m going to have to brainstorm on that... great idea, thanks.<br /><br />It&#039;s more expensive than I thought, if you want a video and/or pics of you in the air then altogether it&#039;s like $350+. They give discounts for larger groups, and it&#039;s so hard to find people irl that want to do it. One of the few situations that makes me say too bad this place is anon bc I know I wouldn&#039;t have that problem here with you adrenaline junkies!!

				Congrats, InkIndulgence!<br />Skydiving was definitely one of the best experiences I&#039;ve ever had.<br />I used to be part of a skydiving club and trust me, it&#039;s well worth it.<br /><br />Also, I really recommend that you be sober for your first time skydiving. It&#039;s so exhilarating that you won&#039;t need any drugs.<br /><br />sdesu

I&#039;ve flown on small motorized planes and sailplanes before, and somehow that doesn&#039;t trigger my fear of heights in any way - probably because its not very likely to fall out of one. With a skydiving i would be mostly concerned with injuring myself on landing (breaking a leg or something like that).<br /><br />Apart from that i think it would be a great experience if you are afraid of heights - once you are out of the plane the only option is to land by parachute, and there is little you can do to change that situation for the worse or better if its a tandem jump. I might actually go for it myself - at the altitude you jump out of the plane the ground is so far down it doesn&#039;t frighten me anymore, and after that there simply is no choice but to endure the experience. <br />

				Wow great replies, I&#039;m definitely thinking I&#039;m going to go sober for this. I also watched that video of the grandma almost falling out, and this other one of this husband/wife couple skydiving and the wife&#039;s parachute fails and the husband has to watch her fall on a concrete parking lot face first. Uggghhh they make me nervous, I am anxious in general about it but I know that it has to be done before I get too old or knocked up or something :)<br /><br />Plus the people I&#039;m going with are all super religious church freaks so if god kills any of us then he&#039;s a dick. Well I suppose he could make an example out of me... anyway I looked up stats and numbers and about 2 people in the world die a month from skydiving, this site has a list updated daily of anyone who dies from it, and what country they&#039;re from, what happened, etc and almost all are people skydiving by themselves (not tandem) and in 3rd world countries. <br /><br />You guys got me even more stoked now.

				I went skydiving solo a few years ago. I watched a video and they put me into a harness and swung me around for a bit before I was &quot;qualified&quot; to skydive by myself.<br /><br />Fucking awesome. I remember just flying through the air and watching the ground. I thought it would rush up towards me, but it was just like a massive pastel colored paining with the wind screaming in my ears.<br /><br />I have never felt so much relief when I pulled the cord and the harness smashed my balls into my abdomen. Pain has never been that good to know you are not going to die.<br /><br />I heard that years later that the place I went to was closed down due to too many people pancaking on the ground.

				Have you read the story of the guy who smoked DMT before jumping? Havent read the whole thread so may have already been mentioned, but is def worth a read: From shroomery<br /><br />&quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; is all i have been thinking for the past week. I finally made my 2.25 grams of crystalline Dimethyl Tryptamine from 2 pounds of Mimosa Hostilis rootbark. Ive already tried DMT recently a few times with exceptional experiences but nothing can ever sum up to what happened this past weekend.<br /><br />Ive been an avid skydiver out of my freind&#039;s own private high-altitude propellor plane for some time now. About a year and a half. Ive constantly been searching for the &quot;truth about everything&quot; with the use of LSD, Shrooms, and Ecstacy for the past year. I felt it was about time i made a humongous leap forward into my discoveries. I made the decision to attempt the world&#039;s first act of tripping DMT while in a high-altitude freefall, at least that i know of.<br /><br />The qualifications for this type of an experiment has to be exceptional safety and perfect timing. Prior to jumping, with complete gear on (including parachute and reserve), i planned to inhale one complete rip from my dmt pipe aboard the plane and then immediately proceed out into the abyss of the sky where i will exhale hopefuly after i pull the line. Nothing in this world, however, could prepare me for what would really happen.<br /><br />Jumping out of an airplane at 35,000 feet while holding your breath is already difficult enough. But to do it while the world&#039;s most potent psychoactive begins to flourishly react with my consciousness is a completely different story. My freind, well call him FRIEND, is the only other person that knows this experiment will take place.<br /><br />Goals of this experiment are:<br />1) NO DYING<br />2) PULL CORD BEFORE EXHALING DMT<br />3) The most ultimate and godlike experience anyone on this planet could ever experience while faced with complete danger to succeed into the next level of ultimate enlightenment.<br /><br />You think im crazy? Well, yeah, this is proof. lol.<br /><br />This past saturday, after a two-day fast, at 10 o&#039;clock in the morning i wake up with the necessary mindset to accomplish a remarkable feat. Speaking with others was off limits, only complete focus on the objective. Noon and im at the dusted airstrip taking off with FREIND. We take one trial run where i take a hit of weed from a pipe, jump off the plane, pull the shoot, and exhale. I immediately became worried when flight was acheived without being able to hold my breath easily. I knew it would be harder with plastic-tasting DMT. I decided another trial was in order. Once down, i grab another parachute and head back to the airstrip where FREIND is refueling. Oddly enough, the second trial commenced at 4:20 pm and the jump went smoothly. Slightly stoned and floating down to the ground, a smile couldnt help but overtake my face as i realized the next time is THE time.<br /><br />7:00 pm and the sun is getting close to the horizon. A few minutes are left until 35,000 feet is obtained and then only half an hour max before its too dark. This was crunch time, and i knew it. I could hardly bare the anticipation. My hands shook incredibly fast and my heartbeat was skyrocketing. I began to have second thoughts and if this didnt work, i could kill myself. I quickly realized that all of the intellect and wisdom obtained from my previous psychedelic experiences were shouting out at me that anything is possible if i just believe. I began to meditate in the plane in a state that almost seemed to be an lsd flashback. I knew my body was pumping fear but my brain was combatting it with faith. I knew this would be the defining point of my pre-adulthood if i succeed and i knew that i could survive. Thinking of conquering this unworldly feat began to enstill a sympathy in myself towards myself. I felt as though i didnt need to do this to define my life, but at the same time i knew i needed to in order to advance in my stages of enlightenment. All of a sudden once everything seemed to be good to go, and ready to fly, the cockpit hatch opened up and FREIND yelled out to me, &quot;You ready to fuckin FLY?!?&quot; I responded only with a smile and began to place the pipe to my mouth as my hand holding the lighter trembled.<br /><br />This time, my bowl was filled with DMT. I cornered myself away from the wind, slowed down my breathing, lit the lighter, placed it to the bowl and began to inhale. Immediately i was astonished by how i could stand the taste this time. Almost as if the DMT was rooting for me as well. After a deep, deep rip, i shut my eyes, focused on the mission, placed my goggles over my eyes, and darted out the door.<br /><br />The immediate weightlessness was startling for some reason this time. Within seconds of shooting out the plane, all hell broke loose. The trip began. Scared and in a state of paralysis, i exhaled the smoke and witnessed my life beginning to flash before my eyes in a kaleidoscope of remembered events ordered in a way that seemed incredibly perfect. All i could think about was my friends, family, and my personal journey through life. My eyes were shut and the roar of the wind was instantaneously replaced by a shearing high pitched crackle. I knew i was falling, i knew i was going to die, i knew i&#039;d miss my life but i did not feel as though i had failed. I suddenly realised that the life that just flashed before my eyes was a good one and began to accept that this is the perfect way to die, in harmony with my own mind. All of the hectic closed-eye-visulatisations of memories and swirling patterns made me feel as though dying was merely the next step in enlightenment which after all, was the inevitable goal of my experiment. Feeling at ease with the thought of death, i felt myself relaxing into the flight and let gravity take over. No longer was i in form and now i was just tumbling through the sky.<br /><br />Visions from my most recent acid trip began to play before my eyes as i fell further through the sky with my eyes still closed. The message i took back from that trip was a subjective reality, that which is produced personally at all times, began to flourish about in my hectic thoughts. I opened my eyes because something compelled me to. I was in the clouds. I readjusted into proper skydiving technique. All i could see was the faint light of the sun glowing my surroundings and i began to wonder if i was in heaven. I wondered if this was the product of my mind producing a subjective reality while in a DMT trip or if i was really dead. Emotions at this stage in time seemed incredibly intense.<br /><br />The clouds parted and gave way to the view of the massive earth quickly accelerating towards me. Suddenly no longer was this a mission to enlighten myself, it was back to staying alive. My guess is the brief DMT trip had began to die down and gave me a chance to save myself so i could take back my story to the rest of the world. Subjective reality philosophy is very interesting to me. In this case, i began to feel as though i had created the earth that was rushing towards me and i had also created the parachute on my back. I could either discover the purpose of the hard, brown land or i could discover the purpose of my parachute. Immediately, all energy that could possibly be imagined was summoned. I felt as though i was gaining power and spirits were helping me. There were beings on the ground tossing light at me. My only response to this vivid hallucination was to embody it and use the energy to my advantage. As i caught the light, my energy seemed to revive and my arms went out to the side as they began to glow a brilliant white. I felt as though i was god, or a god, or at least an angel of some sort and that all of me was glowing white. I felt that if i hit the ground while possessing this much energy, it would be a complete waste and i would let all of the spirits of the world down and the world would gradually die away. I suddenly felt as though pulling that cord was the only thing that mattered in the world at the time. I visualized the president in his office dealing with Iraq difficulties, i visulaized a mother giving birth to a baby i even thought of what id perhaps be doing if this had never occurred. None of it mattered any more.<br /><br />I had to pull that cord. With an amazing feeling of lightlessness, i shut my eyes once more and forced my arms up to the cord and released all of my energy. Instantaneously, the weightlessness was replaced with ultimate heaviness and an incredible pain in my torso. Once the chute was deployed, a sigh of relief and a release of endless amounts of tension took place. I survived. I accomplished. I defeated. I conquered. I fuckin did it!<br /><br />I survived the ultimate test of concsiousness and obtained the ultimate level of enlightenment. No more living life half-heartedly. No more arguments. No more anger. No more stress. Life from then on is to be happy, spiritual and amazing. From then on, i use my new godlike perspective to help me live through life as though i had created it all. This viewpoint will allow me to connect with anything or anyone i wish and will allow me to teach others of these ways.<br /><br />Hovering a thousand feet over the land, i realized how close a call this was and let out a scream of joy that seemed to echo around for miles and minutes. I must have still been feeling the residual effects. As i landed back on the ground, i bent over while beginning to cry and kissed the sandy ground. If i truly am to believe that i created all, than i am to believe that the dirt sticking around my lips at this moment is something i created. I licked my lips and smiled as though i had just finished a meal i prepared for myself.<br /><br />Overall, this experience was IMMENSELY enlightening and also probably one of the most idiotic things a person could do. BUT, i survived and for the better. Dont try this without either talking to me, feeling as though your life is worth the risk, or if you have experience. I instead suggest that each of you find your own crazy idea for a trip, fulfill it, and realize the best way you can live your life once you complete it. Just dont do anything so dumb as to kill yourselves because as i discovered, life can be a beautiful thing and id hate for you to fail at trying to realize this.

				I only read half of the DMT skydiving story. Couldn&#039;t read any more because it sounds like complete horseshit. Jumping from 35 grand without O2 while sucking on a pipe? umm ok, they probably would have passed out from hypoxia first...anyhow<br /><br />I&#039;m a licensed skydiver with a mere couple hundred jumps, but I would HIGHLY recommend NOT taking anything the day of your jump. I won&#039;t even jump after a small puff. Besides the fact that if your instructor notices your high you will lose your deposit, it&#039;s just not a good idea at all. Granted it sounds fun, but when you think about it it is just a really bad idea. A couple years ago an experienced jumper died because he cut away a malfunction at a low altitude where his reserve didn&#039;t have time to inflate, autopsy showed he was high(pot). Your first jump will provide the best natural high you&#039;ve had to date, there is no reason to jeopardize the life of yourself and your instructor.<br /><br />The elderly woman who almost fell out of her harness was 110% the fault of the instructor. The idiot didn&#039;t tighten her harness up and should have his rating yanked. I would recommend jumping at a USPA dropzone(That jump was in Lodi, CA a non-USPA dz). You can look them up on USPA.org.<br /><br />If the concrete story is what I am thinking of, don&#039;t recall them being married, it was because her brake release per-maturely and she didn&#039;t think to release the other as emergency procedures call for. An unfortunate &#039;user error&#039;.<br /><br />Skydivers are risk takers, but it is a calculated risk. The sport is much safer than most perceive it to be. It is an amazing sport and I couldn&#039;t imagine my life without it! It&#039;s not a roller-coaster ride and is more comparable to flying than falling. Don&#039;t psych yourself out by reading of all the things that could possibly go wrong. Trust me, I did the same thing before my first tandem... Listen to your instructor, have a good arch, keep your legs up on landing, and you will have an experience that will be with you the rest of your life.

				I went skydiving man! :) it was a pretty awesome experience...idk if i&#039;d ever do it again, but i certainly am glad i did it at least once.&nbsp; The cool thing about when i went, was that the guy i was strapped to was wearing a glove with a camcorder attached to it.&nbsp; So i have video of the way up in the plane...and the whole way down.&nbsp; It was nuts man, my parents and girlfriend were watching me from the ground, counting how long i was in freefall.&nbsp; Which was about 55 seconds.&nbsp; we jumped at 12,000 feet, and he pulled the cord at 4000 feet.&nbsp; Usually they pull around 7-8000.&nbsp; This freaked my family out haha... i guess they were panicking because everyone else who had jumped had their shoot open wayyy before i did.&nbsp; &quot;they should&#039;ve opened the chute by now...OMG OMG OMG&quot; haha.....<br /><br />i had a buddy who worked with the skydivers, and he told me to tell the guy to pull at 4....i had no idea what that meant....apparently it meant pull at 4000 feet from the ground....yeah....needless to say, i had quite a long free fall...<br /><br />have fun though man, it&#039;s an amazing experience, whether you like it or not.&nbsp; I dont know if i&#039;d go again, but you cant take that experience away from me, so im fairly proud of myself...<br /><br />good luck...tell em &quot;pull at 4&quot;.... its worth the extra free fall!! :)

				Agreed the video and/or photos are def worth the extra. They can be a little expensive, but its definitely and experience to remember and funny when you see you shit yourself when you jump.
