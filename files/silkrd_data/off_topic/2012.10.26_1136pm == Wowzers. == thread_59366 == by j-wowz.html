				Hey guys, <br />In case you didn&#039;t realize, wowzers wasn&#039;t a single entity.<br />We were running as a duo- we are both experienced organic chemists by trade.<br />My partner has had a pretty rough year, he had a pretty heavy relationship breakup and pulled out of our partnership in May. <br />He ceased contact in late May, he said he had acquired a summer of work and apparently is now working for for big pharma.<br />I&#039;m pleased for him as he had a shit time during the first part of this year and deserves a bit of a break.<br /><br />**modified- apparently wowzers clients were extremely unhappy with the work, go to Deepwood/ Ron Paul for some real advice, <br />lets hope his amateurism isn&#039;t discovered in his new workplace!**<br /><br />Cheers, j-wowz<br />

				HA HA ! <br /><br />This has all the signs of a Nigerian email scam, only aimed at a stupid online drug orderer-er (whatever) instead of a stupid Westerner.

This was at the tail end of a very sad breakup with his partner, so he decided to cut loose from the clandestine chemistry world and found a job in org proc dev. I believe he had some chemistry work in europe over summer but this was never really discussed. We have sporadic&nbsp; contact now, but he is rebuilding his life and things are looking up, which i am very pleased about.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lol his anhydrous 4-MMC synthesis didn&#039;t work in the large scale. Also his MDA from Helional wasn&#039;t viable either.
