				I thought it would be interesting to start this thread just as something to kick around. I don&#039;t expect to be in this situation but it would be nice to have in case of necessity.<br /><br />As a short term plan - I would want to stay in the U.S, but I don&#039;t know how I could last with a fake ID that didn&#039;t check out on police systems, it would be nice to be able to drive and do other things on the ID without having to worry about the police stopping you.&nbsp; But once an ID is reported as lost I don&#039;t believe it would check out so that is not an option, also the person whos identity you are using could figure it out and report it. I figure if anything were to happen to me I would be able to go back in years time (don&#039;t ask why, this is just the situation that i imagine)<br /><br />Long term - I figure you would have to find a way to get into another country, but how would you do this if you can&#039;t travel on your ID.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, just creating a thread to kick around as it is cool to think/talk about<br /><br />How would you all go about it?

				Not something that can easily be shared in a forum post. Takes months to plan it out properly. I know a dealer who made 60 odd K dealing in a few short months but was well known to the police, and while the were closing in on him he just disappeared. <br /><br />Over to Spain apparently under a false passport I&#039;ve been told, but you never know. Could have been killed. Or could still be in the UK. I knew him pretty well, and he was a smart guy, so my best bet is he knew he was going to do that all along. <br /><br />Build the business in the open, make a fortune and then just disappear and leave the police scratching there head. He wasn&#039;t a big enough dealer for the police to do an international search on him, so I guess when he was gone they gave up. But he didn&#039;t really have anyone, no family, few friends (mainly acquaintances from the drug world.) so he was 60 grand up and now he&#039;s probably sitting in the sun, living an easy life in a beautiful part of the world.<br /><br />Cu-dos to him. What I&#039;m trying to say though, is that it takes a lot of planning. So much planning that you are going to have to meet the right people before you&#039;ll be able to do it.

				Hm interesting, don&#039;t really have any tips for the OP, but are there places in the world you could retire in reasonable comfort and safety on USD$60k? I mean having your basic things housing, food, a little spending cash covered (not having lavish things).
