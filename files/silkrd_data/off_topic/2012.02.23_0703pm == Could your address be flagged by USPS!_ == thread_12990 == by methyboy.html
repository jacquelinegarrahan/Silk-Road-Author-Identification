				I wouldn&#039;t sweat it if you are truly buying legal items.&nbsp; I get a ton of shit from ebay, a lot of times from China or eastern europe.&nbsp; Never not received a package or had one that looked like it was tampered with.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even had some crazy sketchy looking packaging come through unscathed.

				No, but if you ever get busted by customs with drugs or other illegal items they will flag your address.

				I think he just means if you ever get something intercepted you can assume your address is &quot;hot&quot; and the risk of ordering more contraband to that address increases exponentially.&nbsp; A little dose of paranoia is healthy it keeps you on your toes, complacency leads to mistakes.&nbsp; Calculate risk in your head for every illegal action you take, think through the process, all the players and evaluate your exposure.&nbsp; I think your biggest liability is if you&#039;re selling the L locally or if you tell anyone how you get it.&nbsp; At some point someone might get busted and drop your name.&nbsp; LSD is a bitch because folks buy it, get a group of novices to drop and the risk of someone tripping out and crossing paths with authorities at some point.

				Man...just wait till that newbie or too stoned vendor sends you a bunch of blister packs that sound like morocas...ya know the instruments you shake to make music for inspectors.<br /><br />Twice I&#039;ve had splits put in my packages when both were blister packs. Vendors did not wrap the contents.

				I once bought a large amount of plant base for some spice I made. The packaging had been opened and the mailman dropped off 5+ hours late around 10pm, they probably broke the law by opening it.
