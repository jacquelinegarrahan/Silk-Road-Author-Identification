				Black people today waste their potential talents in performing shitty forms of music (hip hop, rap, etc.).<br /><br />So in this thread, post examples of what you would consider GOOD examples of Black musical talent.<br /><br />I&#039;ll start off with this:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_kCYIBAbJo<br /><br />Brilliant!

				Damn son, I&#039;ve never really been that much into hip hop or rap but what the fuck is up with all these new hip hop producers and rappers going on about molly? Sounds so shit. Its influencing all the kids to go and take &#039;Molly&#039; in stupid amounts and over dose themselves on something thats actually M1 or some other RC.<br />That&#039;s not my only problem with all this modern hip hop and rap; its so materialistic and derogatory which also influences all these kids to go and act like they do. Starting to really toddle my pip, as it were.<br />This is why my favorite type of music has and probably always will be electronic music.. specifically Dnb and deep house at the moment. 8)

If you had half a fucking brain you would realize I have a problem with you idiots that use the word &quot;Black&quot; to describe people. Your just as big an idiot as the poster. <br /><br />To answer your question, I have no &quot;Black&quot; friends, zero. Got it moron. or can you read, didn&#039;t think so because I made this clear in my previous post. I&#039; m not going to waste time trying to explain this to someone so obviously dumb as you are. <br /><br />As far as a troll, who gives a shit if they are. They have a right to this forum just as you are allowed to be as ignorant as you show. Your response to my post just shows how amazing it is that people like you are even able to breath and type at the same time. <br /><br /><br />Fucking squirrel! What a joke, but that&#039;s what squirrels are.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />
