				God damn me what the fuck kind of sick-bastardry is this? It&#039;s threads like this that make me glad I am not a Mod anymore because I can just unleash on the beast on the retard that started this thread. I mean for fuck sake, how stupid do you have to be to think it&#039;s a good idea? Nobody in their right mind would even go anywhere near this idea because you are either a sex offender that is looking for someone they can dart in the neck on the approach and let them wake up and find themselves in some dungeon with your ring piece round their mouths or you are a fucking pig and if that&#039;s the case then you are the fucking stupidest one I have ever had the displeasure of coming across. <br /><br />Jesus fucking Christ and his sheep where the fuck do these people come from?

Better to take it out on the furniture and glassware then a person, furniture is always replaceable, and won&#039;t get you banged up on assault charges.
