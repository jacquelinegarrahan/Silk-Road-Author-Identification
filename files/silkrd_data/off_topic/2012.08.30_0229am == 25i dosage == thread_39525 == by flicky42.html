				I bought some 25I on a clearnet site and the tabs are 1 mg per tab. I took one and had a very weak trip, body high but almost no visuals. Should I take 2? Also it was in a hot place for a night does it degrade with heat because that heat would of degraded LSD.<br /><br /><br />Thank you anyone who comments

				Did you place it on your upper gums? I&#039;ve tripped balls off 1mg, so the blotter probably didn&#039;t have 1mg on it. A member here said they left their blotters in 100 degree weather and they didn&#039;t degrade.

				I put it under my tounge like with acid. Is that bad place? I&#039;ll try the upper gums next time.<br /><br />

				Yeah you fucked up. I did my first time too.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Take 1 blotter and put it on your upper gums for 30 minutes. NBOMe doesn&#039;t like saliva, so you get very minor effects from putting it on your tongue. Also, eating it is 100% worthless so there&#039;s no need to swallow paper for no reason.

				If it&#039;s still weak after putting it on your upper gums, then it&#039;s just plain shit. Just a warning.<br /><br />Or so I&#039;ve heard. I don&#039;t have 25i experience.

				Wait can you guys elaborate on this. MXE can sit in your mouth with saliva (i think) and LSD can too (i think).<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you&#039;re wrong I&#039;m just very interested in the reasoning.

It just seems odd that taking a drug bucally is that much more effective then under the tounge to me. I don&#039;t think MAOI&#039;s are in saliva but I could be wrong.

				O i think I am wrong. MAO enzymes are present in saliva so I guess 25i is way more sensitive to degradation by mao than LSD.<br /><br />I just seems strange to me becuase the 2c series isn&#039;t at all. I guess when you branch the nitrogen more it is more prone to cleavage? Ah I wish I remembered more of my chemistry from college.

So the whatever enzyme reverses that process, leaving you with just 2c-i that gets into your system.
