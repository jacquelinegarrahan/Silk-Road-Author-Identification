				<br />Hi everyone, some of you all know me from my posts on here, I was a little more active in the past but I have always been an avid member of this awesome board and the forum that goes with it.&nbsp; Until recently I was lucky enough to not be affected by the horrors of a terrorist attack.&nbsp; I watched 9-11 happen from my couch, and with that I was able to feel a comfortable distance that some how made me feel a little safer. <br /><br />But this week my life was shattered when I got that first horrible phone call that something bad happened at the race.&nbsp; A bomb went off!?!&nbsp; At first thats all the information I had, I knew my fiance was at the race but its a very long race and what are the odds? I called but all circuits were busy, and at first I was able to calm my brain by reassuring myself everything was alright. I wanted to drive there immediately but we live half a day away and I couldnt leave work, so I paced, and I smoked cigarettes, and I called and I called and I called, but still no answer.<br /><br />Finally after 6 grueling hours I receive a call from my fiances mother that she was in the hospital and had caught some shrapnel in one leg and had torn a ligament in her shoulder from a man that was blasted into her.&nbsp; I later found out from her that if he was not there she would have been much much worse off. I rushed to the hospital imagining the worst, and the news was already reporting about amputations so in my mind I had already imagined the worst.<br /><br />My fiancees mother picked me up and we drove to boston with both of us in tears at what was done.&nbsp; Why did these two brothers do this, what did we do to them to make them so mad, so angry that they would kill the most innocent of all people?? this made no sense and I that that is what angers us the most.&nbsp; &nbsp;When we finally arrived at the hospital that was a madhouse, you could tell the seriousness of the situation by the sheer number of people crying in the waiting room waiting for news from their loved ones in surgery. <br /><br />My fiancee had been operated on the night before because the fragment was very close to an artery and they were worried if they didnt get it out very quickly it might nick the artery.&nbsp; When I saw her I realized how lucky indeed she was, she had taken several pieces of small (pea) size metal in her left leg and a larger part of a nail out of her right leg (that was the peice that was near an artery) The large wound is pretty bad as it took out a large chunk of skin but&nbsp; she said that the man who took most of her shrapnel saved her from much worse injuries.&nbsp; All in all it could have been much worse, and I really thank god that her injuries were not life threatening.&nbsp; She will have another surgery for the busted up shoulder in a few weeks here locally and probably be out of comission for a good 6 months, but it could have been so much worse.&nbsp; So many others were hurt much much worse than her, and 3 even lost their lives in this tragedy.<br /><br />I find it just disgusting that someone can do this to another human being.&nbsp; Be it in the name of religion or politics or anything.&nbsp; Like I said I have been lucky enough to escape any effects of terrorism on my life so far but now that i have been violated like this, it is a horrible feeling.&nbsp; I will never understand the depths that man can go and the pain the he is willing to unleash upon others all in the name of misguided glory. This tragedy has affected the lives of many Americans and it serves to remind us of the evils that exist in this world.&nbsp; <br /><br />I just wanted to get this off my chest.&nbsp; I have so many emotions rights now, anger, frustration, confusion,&nbsp; my fiancee was the one this thing was done to, and she seems to be handling it better than me.&nbsp; What I really want to know is WHY?!@&nbsp; &nbsp;WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO US? and I dont know if I will ever get an answer. <br /><br />I appreciate you guys listening to me rant, like I said I just wanted to get this off my chest maybe it will do me a little good.&nbsp;

				Woah man. First of all, I&#039;m glad she&#039;s doing alright. I have a similar feeling, that sense of security, myself. I hear about natural disasters, accidental deaths, wars etc. and just think&nbsp; &#039;Oh that really sucks. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m okay.&#039; It makes me wonder why them and not me? Sometimes I even feel guilty and/or nervous about if/when it&#039;ll happen to me. Maybe it&#039;s all a matter of time. <br />I heard about people robbing people and getting robbed. I didn&#039;t think much of it until it happened to me. I threw a party and, long story short, I got robbed. People were in my home literally shopping for what they wanted to take with them. I got robbed later in very different circumstances and haven&#039;t been the same since and probably never will. I understand this is different from your experience. I say this to relate to your feelings of being violated. <br /><br />I really hope we find out a &#039;motive&#039;. I put that in quotes because what motive could there possibly be for something like that? &quot;WHY?&quot; was one of my first questions as well. I&#039;m a little mad that the first brother was killed right away. I&#039;m not saying he deserved life but we want and deserve answers. <br /><br />I&#039;m glad you&#039;re fiancee will be okay. Stay strong. Thank you for sharing your story.

				MRGREY! How are you doin old timer, its been ages where have u been lurking?<br /><br />You are correct, I have to remember the positive, like she is alive and not permanently injured. But doctors say it will be 6 months before she can walk again and she may never walk normal, ie always have a limp.&nbsp; And not to mention the PTSD, she hasnt slept a for more than 1 hour without waking up in cold sweats :(&nbsp; These assholes robbed us of the most precious thing which is feeling secure in our own apartment.&nbsp; And we are the semi-lucky ones.<br /><br />I am up to late already because she cant sleep and its good to vent a little.&nbsp; i am still just so torn up inside.&nbsp; these people have stolen a completely innocent girls life,&nbsp; my fiancee loved running (thats why she was there in the first place) and now she may never get to do that again.&nbsp; and for what? because americans treated them bad? because islam hates america? because we did something to chechnya? I dont get it, maybe i never will :(<br /><br />sorry guys for listening to my rant i am just so stressed, all of this on top of all of lives other pressures just has me about to break. im off to sleep gnight
