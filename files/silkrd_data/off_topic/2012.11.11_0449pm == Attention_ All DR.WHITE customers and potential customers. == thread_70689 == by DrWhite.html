				Folks,<br /><br />Just hang in a little longer. I have got a ton of emails requesting orders be placed with me despite SR being down. Don&#039;t worry SR will be back up anytime I spoke with one of the admins and they are just doing security fixes etc. <br /><br />Some folks are able to log in....sporadically (so I have heard). If you have placed an order I will expedite packaging and ship ASAP as soon as I can log in myself. If you are able to get in...place the order you want. There will be no delays this week. I will be expediting orders like crazy this week to play catch up from the downtime we have experienced from SR.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />DOC&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />

He hadn&#039;t logged on for 17 days on Friday due to sickness, and apparently his brother was on the account. Not sure what&#039;s going on there but it seemed a bit odd.
