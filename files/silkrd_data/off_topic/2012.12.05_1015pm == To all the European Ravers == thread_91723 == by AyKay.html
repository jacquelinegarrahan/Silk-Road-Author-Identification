				I&#039;ve been DJing for awhile now and honestly I&#039;m sick of all the music here in the US. I really love the Dutch House sound but dont know where to look for music. If you guys have any free time I&#039;d love to hear names of DJ&#039;s your into over there or even just the song your listening to right now. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />AyKay

Julian R has some great stuff. So anything that sounds like that. And yes I like hardstyle too. Im really just looking for any kind of techno, from any scene. I like discovering new music.

				I really think that raves in general since the beginning of the 00s are lame as fuck, probably psytrance/psychedelic parties are the only type of scene that still has some integrity and decency left... <br /><br />OP, the whole western rave scene sucks, you wanna try something new? try going to Israel/India they have a killer scene over there...

I would love to go to Europe or anywhere else in the world for raves or nature party! Anything but here, thanks for the suggestions guys! I&#039;ll keep looking back every now and then to see what else people from all across the world come up with.
