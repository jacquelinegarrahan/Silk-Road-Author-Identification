No, there is no error message, it just tells you that the upload box is full and you have to remove it from your post<br />to be able to post your message. At this point it has been full for the past 5 months, so I suggest SR remove the option all together or use 1 of the options I suggested on Jan. 3rd, 2012 in my OP.<br />Requests to SR in January yeilded no responce. I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m the only member that uploads little bits of pixels for the community&#039;s amusement. Can a Mod pass this along and respond.<br />Oh that&#039;s right mods also don&#039;t respond on a regular basis. My bad. Maybe If I offer a bitcoin as compensation I may get a responce.<br /><br />Bikerbum

Once the participant total maxed out the proprietors closed the triangle <br />which as in all pyramids the last guys are out. The trick is always to come in early, watch participant total and then withdraw the remainder of your accumilated coin. This game<br />topped out in March. Don&#039;t get involved if you don&#039;t know how to play. The old adage of if it looks too good to be true then it ain&#039;t true still applies. Thanks for inquiring. <br /><br />Bikerbum

It would benefit vendors and buyers alike with uploads of shitty or great gear. <br /><br />We wouldn&#039;t have half these fucking problems with shill post&#039;s about how great all this shit is. Buyers and vendors could compare after a review by the powers at be that the upload could post.<br /><br />But no,&nbsp; they just keep their trap shut and leave &quot;Attachments and other options&quot;,&quot;shortcuts: hit shift+alt+s to submit/post or shift+alt+p to preview&quot; up for no apparent use. <br /><br />So periodically I&#039;ll continue to post:&nbsp; &quot;NOTICE: This Site&#039;s Upload Folder Is Full&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for your input but a little more info would be appreciated. PM me for kicks and giggles if you know something other than a vague &quot;It&#039;s Full On Purpose&quot;&nbsp; wink, wink.<br /><br />Bikerbum
