				SR support refuses to show me any kind of proof or evidence for the outrages claim that I am some past scammer. ::)<br /><br />Despite what your personal beliefs may be about me, this is the way that dictatorships start. PERSONAL OPINION IS NOT FACT.<br /><br /><br />Bottom line, one of the mods is a MDMA vendor and I was digging too deep into his pockets. <br /><br />This will teach me to be a legitimate vendor. You can&#039;t win on this site unless you&#039;re a ass kisser or a scammer. I sent out every single order that FE&#039;d for me. EVERY single one. <br /><br /><br />Yet people like heatfan fucks over the community for several thousand and the mods still support him in his actions? This place ain&#039;t about nothing but the end game.<br /><br />The admins don&#039;t care about customers. They only care about the cut they get, and that a pair of lips is always on their ass.

				I guess if running a massive FE scam is &quot;whatever they want&quot; then yeah, they can ban you now for whatever they want.<br /><br />You got sloppy. At least your prior scams were run with class, like you still cared back then. Now you&#039;re just going through the motions and expecting the same windfall. Try harder man, you can do it! Bashing mods bro? You&#039;re better than this. Now get off the forums, start creating new vendor accounts and get back on the FE scam horse. No time to waste!

				I remember seeing more than 2 topics about how people were complaining you were a scammer.<br /><br />I have never ordered from you. And I don&#039;t know your customers.<br /><br />But I didn&#039;t even bother posting in any thread, which accused you of being a scammer because on the one side, you say these are baseless claims but on the other side you immediately lose your cool and insult anyone and everyone. And when a vendor acts that immature they immediately lose my respect. Maybe SR support saw it the same way.

				I have read these meanderings passively for the past few weeks. Honestly, I thought you were being railroaded and falsely accused at first. I almost bought into your accusations of there being an MDMA cartel forcing up prices on SR etc.. Now, you have revealed that you were in fact Coachella and engaging in deceit the entire time. I stopped listening early on. Mostly because you are so damned loud. There is no reason to be as loud as you are. It comes across as childish and desperate. Why do you try so desperately to be heard? On so many issues? If you want to legitimately vend on this site, despite being banned, why not start up a quiet operation. Alter your over the top darknet persona. Stop posting 100 times per day. Stop harassing other members. Open a vendor account, offer up your product, advertise as needed, and go about your business quietly. If you have access to product and can make money with it, it is in your best interest to do so. The way you are acting is foolish. If you can make quick money by running scams or whatever it is you do, consider all the effort you are putting into it. All the ill will you are spreading in the process. What is wrong with you that you need this explained to you? Why am I bothering? Something tells me this will not get through to you...
