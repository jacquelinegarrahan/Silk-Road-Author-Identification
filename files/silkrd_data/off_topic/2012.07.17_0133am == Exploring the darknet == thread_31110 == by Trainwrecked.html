				Looking to explore the darknet, and the hidden wiki only takes you so far.&nbsp; If there&#039;s any communities or suggestions to point me in the right direction to explore the darknet, please message me.<br /><br />On another note, I think I&#039;m gonna start straying away from this place a bit more.&nbsp; Things are getting pretty crazy, and with all the new articles coming out, I&#039;m just waiting for this place to be invaded by incompetent morons.

				Oh I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; It&#039;s called the Darknet for a reason.&nbsp; The online underground.&nbsp; Lots of fucked up things go on in the underground.

				I don&#039;t really know how to explore it besides the hiddenwiki. I&#039;m kind of interested too.<br /><br />But yes, some of the things I managed to read were quite fucked up.

				A person on another forum told me about the Silk Road. He told me how to access it and specifically said do not use it or enter the Darkweb. Sometimes I believe he was right. If the Hidden Wiki isn&#039;t enough for you then I don&#039;t know what else you&#039;re after. I don&#039;t even go there anymore. It&#039;s like some sort of Turkish bazaar full of horrible things.

				There is no shortcut to the underground depths. The quickest way is to befriend the right people and keep moving deeper in the direction you want to go. <br /><br />A hint, the better you are at subtlety and diplomacy the better. ^_^

				I&#039;ve always kinda wanted to explore too, but I know that there&#039;s some really fucked up shit out there that I don&#039;t care to see. <br /><br />Lemme know if you come across anything cool :P
