				Hello, I just ordered a few grams of Cubensis Shrooms.<br />The dosage seems to be 2-5 grams. I paid about $8.5 for just one gram and don&#039;t get the point of continuously using them like 2 or 3 times a week.<br />They&#039;re so expensive or is it just me, who&#039;s thinking that?<br /><br />Is there any way in doing smaller doses, getting them cheaper or something?<br />LSD is also very expensive. Are there any other substances, which create similar effects?

				Galindoi has some of the best prices IMO.&nbsp; Plus he is a very professional vendor.&nbsp; I guess it comes down to the individual and if &quot;the trip&quot; is worth the $.&nbsp; IMO some of my trips I would consider to be priceless so I&#039;m willing to put up the money.<br /><br />Galindoi:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/29ac311e16

				You should try out Galindois caspules, taking 12 or so will have you tripping hard for 5+ hours in my experience

				In Brazil, usually we make tea.<br /><br />Sometimes you use a lot of mushrooms, expecting a very concentrated tea and get a moderate trip.<br /><br />Sometimes you use less mushroom, expecting a diluted tea and get a hard trip.<br /><br />I believe mushrooms make no sense...<br /><br />Other: in Brazil we usually do not grow and never pay for mushrooms.

				Well,<br /><br />I do not have any standard for prices, since I never bought mushrooms here;<br />I do not have any standard for dosage, cause it varies a lot. I only can say that people here say wild mushrooms (naturally grow in the sheet of cows) is much stronger than ones grown artificially.<br /><br />And the mushrooms we take here is not the same you bought.<br /><br />Put in few words, sorry, but I can&#039;t help you... :/

				Sorry if my sentence make no sense.<br /><br />I mean... the &quot;dosage&quot; makes no sense. I really got hard trips with few mushrooms and light trips with a lot of them. They grow without light, they came from another planet.

It&#039;s not very hard.<br /><br />&nbsp;Second thing you can do is make fungahuasca. Grind Syrian Rue seeds and take the ground powder along with your fungi. The harmine in the Syrian Rue will amplify the effects of the psilocybin. My preferred way to do this is to grind both the syrian rue seeds and the dried fungi, then add them to chocolate. It gives this awesome bitter taste and chalky texture to the chocolate.. it tastes like something you KNOW is going to FUCK YOU UP.<br /><br />&nbsp;But it is not for the faint at heart or timid of palate :D<br /><br />&nbsp;I will probably list a few of the fungahuasca chocolates once harvest starts rolling in.. just a few for the serious psycho-culinary explorer types.<br />&nbsp;
