				For every 100 karma you get SR awards you $100. They also deduct $100 if you hit -100 for pissing too many people off. Be careful, karma is extremely serious around here and if you are not careful soon you will owe SR a lot of money. One prominent user known as masterblaster recently declared bankruptcy as a result of trolling. <br /><br />Edit: Oh shit I&#039;m about to get another 100 bucks!!
