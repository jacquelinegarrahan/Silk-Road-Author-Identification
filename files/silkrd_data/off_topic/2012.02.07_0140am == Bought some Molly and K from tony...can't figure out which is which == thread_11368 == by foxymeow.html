				So I bought 12g of MDMA and 1g of K from tony76. However, he put it all in individual 1g bags and I can&#039;t figure out which is which. DJ A and DJB is in town and I was going to try and get back stage with DJB cause he is LOVES K. What are the identifying characteristics of K? Might have to try test kitting all of them XD

				Talking about two DJs in your town right now kind of pin points where you live, doesn&#039;t it? But ketamine tastes sour and ecstasy tastes bitter.

				Never had or done K, but I think MDMA has a rootbeer smell if it&#039;s good. I like Tony&#039;s MDMA :D<br />I would suggest smelling each bag.

Maybe I just can&#039;t read this testing kit right. <br /><br />Tony msged me, I think I figured it out. Maybe if all of them didn&#039;t look so damn wonderful and pure I would be able to figure it out.<br /><br />TONY STOP GIVING ME SUCH GOOD DRUGS!

Needless to say....doing a line of 2c-e gave him an interesting and eventually fun night. <br /><br />He called me up the next day saying, &quot;Hey I took that K last night&quot; and I responded, &quot;WHAT K?!?! I haven&#039;t had MXE around in a month.&quot;<br /><br />Me, my friend, and a bunch of girls took the K and the MDMA during the show....Best. Combo. Ever.
