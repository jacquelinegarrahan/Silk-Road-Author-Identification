				YES - and that&#039;s a big YES<br /><br />a friend of mine had a similiar problem few years ago and iirc, he had his girlfriend get a cashier&#039;s check made out to him for $10K and he put a few K up in cash, which would have gotten a corpse the credit on the purchase, for the balance<br /><br />then he simply paid it off, a grand or two per month - he didn&#039;t like worrying about monthly car pmts, checkbooks etc<br /><br />you might talk to a friend working at the dealership, if you can

				Anything from 9 thousand and below your fine but 9001 and up they have to fill out a tax paper and send it the IRS, if you know the owner there you could ask if he wouldn&#039;t send it and he might I payed 26000 cash for mine right off the lot almost a year ago :P and I haven&#039;t heard shit.

				Go find a real good deal on a used car for $9,000 (doesn&#039;t matter if you like it just as long as it&#039;s a good deal). Then take the $9,000 car and trade it in along with $9,000 cash and a $2,000 loan to get new car.

				The limit for a business to report a transaction is $10,000.&nbsp; If you do a cash transaction for $9,999.99, nothing would really happen unless the bank or business wanted to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) because you blew your cover and were acting sketchy.&nbsp; The second you hit the dollar amount of $10,000.00, a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) MUST be filed according to federal law.&nbsp; This is a per day report, not a per transaction report.&nbsp; If a bank sees you stringing in deposits all the time, always skirting under the limit, they may end up reporting you as well to save their ass.&nbsp; The PATRIOT Act really fucked a lot of things up as far as anonymity with cash.<br /><br />If you want a $20k car, go find out how much they want down on it with your credit rating.&nbsp; Kindly put that down, and each month you can pay more than what is owed.&nbsp; Always keep cash in your pocket though, so if something happens you don&#039;t miss payments.<br /><br />Once the car is paid off, wait a few months and feel free to sell it.&nbsp; You have now semi-successfully washed money for yourself.&nbsp; You can now afford to put down $15k via a Cashier&#039;s Check from the bank on a newer car, and start the process over.<br /><br />Just remember, the tax man (IRS) is always watching.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t care if you sell drugs, kidnap, murder, etc.&nbsp; He cares that you pay your damned share of taxes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Voracious

				I&#039;m not sure where you&#039;re from, but I know in Australia anything over $10,000 is audited by the Government and you need to provide a reason as to why you are using that much cash for something and where the money came from.<br />They will also be suspicious of anything between $5,000 and $10,000 and they may ask questions.<br /><br />So no, do not buy a car for that much money. And if you sell a car and get paid in cash, they will check to make sure that you have recently transferred the registration of a car you owned into someone elses name.<br />The Government are nosy cunts and they will check everything.<br />

				folks have been quoting $10K for years, since the early 90s - sometime in the late 90s it was lowered to $3,000 for cash transactions at banks, and even still banks are required to report unusual cash transactions that are abnormal for the customer or for an unknown customer, even if lower than $3k<br /><br />i have to believe it would have been lowered for car dealerships, jewelry stores, real estate transactions etc<br />i&#039;d check with a friend at a dealership, one that you know you can trust before making the deal<br /><br />just my 02

				No it&#039;s $10,000. I just pulled up all the forms from the government. Like I said maybe he was thinking of a SAR but a SAR has no requirement, that&#039;s just a general &quot;hey I think there is something fishy about this&quot;.

				I&#039;ve brought several second-hand cars with cash, all under $25,000 and never fallen under any suspicion. I recommend searching for an &#039;almost-new&#039; second hand car that is the type you want on the internet and sussing out the person you are buying it from. My current car I brought for 22K in cash from a guy I would swear was a drug dealer too, big Lebanese guy with lots of jewelery and tattoos and I could tell there was no way in hell he was going to report me to anyone.<br /><br />I would definitely avoid going into a dealership and buying a new car with a large amount of cash. If you can get it on finance and pay with regular cash deposits that would look a lot less suspicious, even though after interest you will end up paying a bit more. If you are paying $300 a week for a year plus $5000 up-front that is a lot easier to explain than $20K upfront even though you might save $600 paying the whole thing upfront.

				It all depends where you get your cash from. If you&#039;ve nothing to hide, go for it. Otherwise, find a crooked dealer and pay a premium for a wink / nudge deal.

				Why not buy a car off craigslist for cash? Maybe pay a little extra if they don&#039;t seem willing to write it down as you paying much less.<br /><br />When my friend bought his car (for only $3k though) the guy wrote it as he sold it to him for like $200 because you get a tax refund I believe.
