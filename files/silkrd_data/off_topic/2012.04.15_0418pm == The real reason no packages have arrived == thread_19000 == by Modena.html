				It was suggested to me that I come here from the other places to tell all of you the real reason none of your packages have arrived. While on my porch… what? Yes. If you can keep your head when all around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you! If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, and yet make allowance for their doubting too! If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about, don&#039;t deal in lies! Or being hated, don&#039;t give way to hating, and yet don&#039;t look too good nor talk too wise!<br /><br />But too! The reason, is now given to you. All of the governments, working in unison, have been buying packages from each and every vendor here for the past six months. 1st: If I&#039;m not for me, who am I? Nobody!&nbsp; &nbsp;2nd: Yet, if I&#039;m only for me, what am I? Nothing! So, it&#039;s clear that now they have the sending address and methods(??!!!) of each vendor. Working in unison, they delay all our packages, because they know what to look for, and now have each one of our addresses, and know all we&#039;ve bought and will swoop down all at once to capture each of us, and make us slaves to their system.<br /><br />As teach astronomers Abraham-Israel-Moses-Buddha-Hillel-Jesus, Spinoza-Paine, Sagan &amp; Mohammed, inspired every 76 years, 6000 years. So it&#039;s clear that we should try and escape by whatever means we can before it&#039;s too late<br />

				None? You mean no packages have arrived anywhere?<br /><br />When looking for feedback and in forums unread, packages daily arrive to dismay in perpetuity all governments sworn to subvert the rights of man.&nbsp; And then we rejoice in the harmony of disobedience of a civil nature.&nbsp; The other places have not the relativistic opportunity to spew their vile gossip in the places inhabited by those who trust in the men and women who do not deal in lies and filth.<br /><br />But too!&nbsp; The reason is now given to you that all the governments, having not the ability to coordinate in unison, instead depend on the lies and filth of grubby little trolls.&nbsp; 1st, if not you, then who?&nbsp; The next one that comes along. 2nd:&nbsp; If you, then why do we need another?&nbsp; SO, it&#039;s clear that they have evidence of nothing at all. addresses real yet fictional in the minds of those who think such reality works in court with laws that are as of YET not written again.

				That&#039;s fine, tell the SWAT team they can come on in but they better not shoot at my dogs or somebody may shoot back.&nbsp; Seriously, though...do you have ANY idea how strapped for cash most if not all governments are these days?&nbsp; What makes you think they have the buying power that the general SR population has?&nbsp; Governments are not in the business of buying drugs, they are in the business of selling drugs.&nbsp; They WILL take your drugs, but they won&#039;t pay you for them.&nbsp; Seize the drugs then sell the drugs, that is how you keep the lights on in the capital cities around the World.<br /><br />The business model of paying above street price, the neat SR and BTC premiums and such makes no sense if you are in the business of profiting from drugs.&nbsp; Even if they did plan to purchase drugs, governments would do it the cheaper way and buy in extreme bulk from the source itself in their native land and then smuggle it officially back to their own country (recall the CIA planes that crashed with coke aboard?).<br /><br />It is far more likely that your favorite sellers may be some type of government employee than it is that every buyer is a government employee like in the OP.&nbsp; If this wasn&#039;t a joke or something, just calm down and realize many, many people here have spent more money than they&#039;re willing to admit on successful and fruitful purchases.&nbsp; Whatever your substance of choice, I&#039;d say take some of it and chill out.&nbsp; Unless the substance is some type of drug that is actually MAKING you have thoughts like in the OP...in which case you may want to re-evaluate that particular hobby..
