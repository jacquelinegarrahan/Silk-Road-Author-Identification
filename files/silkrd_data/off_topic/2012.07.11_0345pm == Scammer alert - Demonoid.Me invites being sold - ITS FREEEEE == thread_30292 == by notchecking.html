It would be like selling air in a bottle on SR

				The thing is invites are, indeed, free. The catch is that you need to get someone to invite you. It&#039;s selling something that people may have trouble gaining access to. <br /><br />I would only consider selling an invite a scam if the seller lied about the nature of obtaining an invite, saying it was super exclusive/difficult, etc.

				Yeah, people should be able to sell their invites, it&#039;s their property!&nbsp; It&#039;s not a scam if the invite works and they don&#039;t imply it&#039;s different than a normal invite.

Selling free invites isnt a scam its just the actions of an enterprising individual. I wouldnt do it myself but I cant feel bad for people that would rather pay for an invite then go to the site and read for 5 minutes and get it for free.
