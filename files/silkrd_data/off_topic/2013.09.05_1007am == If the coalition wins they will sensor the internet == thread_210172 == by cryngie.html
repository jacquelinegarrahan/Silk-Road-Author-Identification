				Just released today was a plan by the coalition party in Australia that if elected the internet will be filtered by ISP and new smartphones and modems <br /><br />I think this guy is a complete joke and can not understand why people would vote for him

Parents should be responsible to filtering their kids internet.<br /><br />We are not children! treat us like adults. Not blocking &quot;adult material&quot; from us.<br />You can go through your ISP and prove you are 18+ and have it unblocked. But it should not be necessary to have to do this!<br />I bet the process for unfiltering it is ridiculously hard and a lengthy process...

				It was later stated that this is not going to be mandatory so get your knickers out of a knot.. It&#039;s going to be an opt in so if you have kids and you want their computer or phone filtered then you have the option to do so, it is not going to affect every day joe blows busting out their baby gravy over red tube videos

				I think you willl find it is a op out policy so everything is blocked and as dingo said you then need to prove you are over 18 to unlock it.&nbsp; <br />Either way its wrong to try and filter the net aqnd think about all the other sites that will be caught by the &quot;intelegent&quot; program and its keywords

				Abbot came out 3 Minutes after the policy was made public and stated it was a mistake and was meant to say opt in, was the talk of the news this morning..<br /><br />No government or political party would be stupid enough to try an make a policy where they filter the internet, especially just before an election

				Well Abbots now in, so I suppose we&#039;ll just have to sit back and watch how many policies that he promised he would or wouldn&#039;t implement such as scrapping the carbon tax, reviving the &quot;workchoices&quot; agreements and the internet filter 2.0. History has only shown that no matter who takes the reigns somewhere along the line they end up doing a backflip on at least one of their pre-election promises regarding any particular policy and I think the internet filter will be somewhat easier for the Libs to gain support for in comparison to alot of their other policies.<br /><br />It will be yet another sad, negative milestone if it does get implemented. I personally believe that they&#039;ll use child exploitation as their platform to provide a basis to attempt to make this an issue again but apparently for the mean time their abolishing such plans.

				nah pretty certain it&#039;s not, yet. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210172.msg1517817#msg1517817">Quote from: kmfkewm on September 05, 2013, 11:04 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">pretty sure the internet in Australia is already censored<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was in the UK recently. the filtering they have is total waste of money and retarded.<br />you goto eztv.it for e.g and it comes up saying its banned.. and then gives you a link for some eztv proxy site. <br />You can then proceed to download the torrents... I haven&#039;t looked into it, but seems like its probably just based on DNS.<br />hopefully if Aus does do it, it will be as retarded as the UK version.
