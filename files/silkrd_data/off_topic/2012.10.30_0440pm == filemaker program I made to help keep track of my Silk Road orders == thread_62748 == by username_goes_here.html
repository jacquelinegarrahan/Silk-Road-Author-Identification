				Hello all,<br /><br />I am a regular buyer here and created a drop dead simple filemaker program to help me keep track of all my orders, reviews, and vendors.<br /><br />You can download it here<br /><br />***CLEARNET WARNING***<br /><br />http://filebin.ca/KuDk5rtrYD1<br /><br />You have to have filemaker installed to run this... if there is any interest I can create full runtime programs if you want.<br /><br />This program does not connect to the internet with the following exceptions.<br /><br />1. The program will access bitcoinexchangerate.com to learn the current value of bitcoins<br />2. The program will access blockchain.info and show you a transaction status if you click on the &quot;show status&quot; button<br /><br />outside of that the program is fully self contained.&nbsp; You&#039;ll be able to store all the follwoing information<br /><br />order number<br />order date<br />btc paid<br />btc to USD conversion -- so you know how much it cost you down the road<br />USD unit price - so you know how much each unit is<br />Arrival Date<br />Vendor information<br />Review notes and 1-5 stars<br />The program also can store your btc address and private keys if you want.<br />You can also print off a btc paper note or paper wallet<br />You can store 2 pictures of every item

				well, Filemaker already does encryption on it&#039;s files. <br />But yes, you can run the software from an encrypted container on windows, or mac.<br /><br />This is how I do it, run it from a truecrypt container.<br /><br />There&#039;s no path to change?&nbsp; just put the filemaker file in the encrypted container of your choice and run it from there.

				What&#039;s the logic behind this? Seems like the exact opposite of what anyone would want to do with all their orders. Transaction history already stays too long as it is.

				yes, this is geared towards buyers.<br /><br />I made this program to keep track of my orders over time... I buy a lot from here and easily loose what is what...&nbsp; this way I can see what I paid for a tab of acid 2 months ago so when/if I go to resell it it can be hard for me to know what I paid for the tab.<br /><br /><br />also, the username/password is admin with no password,&nbsp; the file is fully unlocked so update it as you wish to suite your needs.<br /><br /><br />This may not be useful to anyone but myself but I thought I&#039;d share so use it if you want, otherwise.... don&#039;t.<br />
