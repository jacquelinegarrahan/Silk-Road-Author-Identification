				I saw this film today, and honestly it was one of the best documentary films I have ever seen.<br /><br />It started from where the Coca is produced - countries like Bolivia, Peru, etc - they interviewed the farmers. One man actually broke down crying because the government in Columbia used anti plant chemicals and he had no food to support his family. So he grew a new coca field. They then moved into politics, it was LARGELY unbiased. I commend that. After, they showed the Mexican violence. That was the last 20 mins or so. <br /><br />Surprisingly they showed NO using! It was about production, and all the live, money, and guns it takes to get it from coca leaf to cocaine HCL on your table. <br />Some parts saddened me.<br /><br />You&#039;d be surprised to learn what you do in this industry.<br /><br /><br />At the end, they say do these three things:<br />1) Sign up to help end the war on drugs<br />2)Keep pushing for a standardized price / output - pharma versions<br />3)Fuck the gov&#039;t with sites like this (lol I make this up)<br /><br />Very good, I&#039;d HIGHLY recommend it. It&#039;s not some low budget college kid either, true professional journalism.<br /><br />They also play a lot of cool Spanish rap.<br /><br />Edit - forgot A in caine.

				Here is a preview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07C014583mk<br /><br />They feature interviews with some high up officials, the President of Peru, President of Bolivia, Spokesman of the EU commission on drugs. All agree the war isn&#039;t working.<br /><br />No &quot;this is old news&quot; comments please. Obviously, I&#039;m talking about the Doc.

				Thanks for the tip, I like drugs documentaries. I like unbiased drugs documentaries, but biased one&#039;s are also very enjoyable to watch, because of all the crap they say about the drugs&nbsp; :P

				Thanks for the rec. I look forward to watching it. I just finished a coke doc not too long ago; I had no idea the coca plant has to grow for over a year before it can be harvested.

				Does anyone know of any drug documentaries that focus more of the Biochemistry side of how the drug works on the brain? I&#039;m sick of documentaries that solely focus on trip reports and societies reaction to it.<br /><br />This one does sound interesting though I&#039;ll try it sometime.

				City of God is the best film, its not a documentary but it kinda has everything, its also based on a true story loosely.<br />Watching films about coke and stuff can be quite upsetting, but the main thing to remember is the violence on the other side only happens due to demand not being filled by local vendors, ie the fact the government has outlawed supply means people have to look further afield, which unfortunately due to the immense poverty in latin america means people are willing to decapitate others to gain a better market share of this demand. long story short, the govt suppresses supply doing nothing to demand, theese fellas step upto the plate, if the government didnt ban it kids in mexico wouldnt be getting hacked to death.

If you live in the US, they have actually been playing it pretty frequently - it must be new. IE at 2am last night they played it again. If you check your local listings I&#039;m sure it will be on sometime this week. Maybe even today. I think they are tying to get publicity for a cause, and I respect that.<br /><br />It seems very new, not sure if there is a torrent yet. It&#039;s 2 hours, and the best on cocaine I&#039;ve ever seen.<br /><br />If you want something on how drugs affects the body, watch drugs inc, cocaine. This is way more deep tho.
