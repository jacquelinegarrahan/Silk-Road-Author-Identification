				Ok so the plan was to purchase something from Mastermind Designs but for some reason I am not getting a warm and fuzzy about that due to information being post here and Mastermind not responding to it or making it right from the looks of things so right now a purchase from this vendor is on the back burner. So with that being said does anyone have any legitimate suggestions?

				Make sure you are 100% comfortable in your gut with any transaction on here. The last thing you want is to be kicking yourself after the fact when a transaction goes bad.<br /><br />Good Luck
