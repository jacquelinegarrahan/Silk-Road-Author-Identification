				Hello Everyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;It is almost harvest time.. which means I will get to play in the kitchen (mwahahahaha).<br /><br />I thought I might make some treats. What have you seen/tasted.. and what do you like? <br /><br />&nbsp;What have you heard of but never had you wish you could try?<br /><br />Most of us have had &quot;Shroom chocolates&quot;... these are basically shroom flour (ground fruiting bodies) mixed into chocolate and poured into a mold.<br /><br />I myself am fond of &quot;choclatl funghuasca&quot;.. which is basically shroom chocolates with ground syrian rue seeds mixed in for good measure. The harmine potentiates the psilocybin. The taste is strong, very bitter and powerful. It makes your testes quake in fear. I&#039;m a fan.<br /><br />I also am fond of Trippin&#039; (Reese) Balls. Trippin Reese Balls are the classic chocolate peanut butter balls, but instead of margarine you use real butter (I will make them with cannabutter one day) and coconut oil. You then mix in the shroom flour with the powdered sugar and ground graham cracker crumbs. Roll, freeze, then dip in mixed chocolate &amp; parafin wax.<br /><br />I also have a Blue-My-Mind-Berry Cheesecake. This uses Blue Berry Topping as the carrier medium for the shroom flour (I am nervous about letting the oven work on the actives). <br /><br />I&#039;ve also decided this harvest I&#039;m going to make some No-Bake Cookies (aka Cow Patties After The Rain). I think these might be quite stellar.<br /><br />&nbsp;What else have people seen, liked, and would like to taste again? Anyone want to give me some ideas? If you suggest it, and I like the idea and try it.. I will feed it to you free of charge :D

				I have heard of mushroom pizza but never tried it. I dont know how they react to heat so may want to do a bit of research before hand. I have also made my own protein shakes, but thats not something you could ship. It was basically soy milk(regular milk and shrooms? ...yeah) and some fruit and chocolate for flavor.<br /><br />The best edible I had was a mud pie, it was instant chocolate pudding(where the shrooms were), graham cracker crust, some chocolate powder on top, and gummy worms with acid. Was pretty much the best thing in my whole life.<br /><br />I wonder about other kinds of candy, like something fruity instead of chocolatey. Maybe a some fruit gummies somehow? You could also try shipping the flour with some recipes on it, like an actual baking product. Thats the kind of stuff I hope to see out of silk road some day, actual consumer product versions of drugs.

				I don&#039;t understand the point of making edibles with shrooms, surely it just makes the onset take longer? Besides, there is nothing like biting into an apple during the peak of a trip.

Either way you are eating the fungi.. it&#039;s all being churned into a big trippy mass in your stomach anyway :D<br /><br />The edibles thing has three purposes...&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; 1. Is cause it&#039;s just really neat and cool (or so many people think)<br />&nbsp; 2. It can be a useful concealment/camoflage tactic<br />&nbsp; 3. Some people have real problems with the taste/texture when doing large enough doses to really trip hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;That said a cook who knows what they are doing can put enough trip into a small amount of food (enough to hold in your palm) to have you chewing the carpet for hours. And it will taste like something off a summer church buffet picnic table.<br />

				While I was traveling in Laos I came across many restaurants that sold Happy-Shakes,&nbsp; and they were extremely tasty shakes that had mushrooms in them.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know how they are made but they all had chocolate and bananas in them and you could not taste the mushrooms,&nbsp; so you could try to make a nice smoothie or a shake and mix some shrooms in the blender!

				Toeless, you can grind up the mushrooms into a fine powder and potency will not really be affected.&nbsp; Once you grind them up into a powder, the sky is the limit on what you can do with them.&nbsp; You can even put them in capsules like Galindoi&#039;s were.

				Hi,<br /><br />All these edibles sound good. I would also suggest blue honey. A note of caution regarding the fungayahuasca chocolates - syrian rue is a bit dangerous as it will cause pregnant women to abort their fetus. This is not the case for refined/purified harmine, harmaline and THH, though there are dietary precautions and potentially dangerous interactions with antidepressants and mdma. Just to let you know. If you&#039;re going to post these you should tell people the risks.<br /><br />Peace,<br />DiMiTri

				Dmitri,<br />&nbsp; Thanks for the input. If I ever list those as a product for sale I will definitely do the whole MAOI warning label.

The finest grind (espresso) setting is best.<br />&nbsp;It&#039;s best to keep your initial powder grind out of your main food blender until you&#039;ve started your other ingredients.. that way you don&#039;t leave powder in the crevices and cracks. <br />&nbsp;Basically grind the shrooms separately, reserve the powder, add the most liquid ingredients of the smoothie first, then the shroom powder and the solids. This is best from a cooking perspective to keep your gear clean of residuals.
