				I&#039;m getting ready for my first and maybe only (for a long time anyway) MDMA experience. I traveled overseas to buy domestically to avoid the dangers of getting caught in my fucked up home country, and I &quot;smuggled&quot; 2 tabs of 90mic LSD with me so I could try candy-flipping.<br /><br />Most advice seems to suggest taking the LSD first and then the molly 3 hours in, however it occurred me that I might want to reverse this so I can experience a &quot;pure&quot; MDMA experience plus a taste of candyflipping in the latter half of the peak.<br /><br />Also, I know from copious amounts of experience that 180 mics of this acid will do very little for me on its own, so the idea of waiting to peak on the acid has little value for me.<br /><br />So now I have 3 options:<br /><br />1: Do the traditional candy-flip. Maybe an up-side of this would be that I could spend a few hours in a botanical garden or park on mild acid and then rush back to my hotel room for the main event with the MDMA for a 2-birds-one-stone kinda trip.<br /><br />2: Do my reverse candy-flip. I can know what a full 200mg of molly feels like, and then I can slip the acid in while peaking. I understand I might exacerbate the come-down symptoms but I&#039;m not too worried about this.<br /><br />3: I could just say fuck candyflipping and do the MDMA separately. But I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d be missing out on something. Maybe next year I&#039;d have another chance though.<br /><br />What should I do guise, other than stop overthinking the fuck out of everything like this?

				well, <br /><br />MDMA on its own is a great experience, so if you&#039;ve never done it before I would say: go for the pure feeling of MDMA...<br />if you like it, you could try candy flipping in a few months (or maybe you&#039;ll enjoy it so much that you&#039;ll keep it to the pure experience). <br /><br />If you want to feel &quot;some more of it&quot; you could look into piracepam (to be taken half an hour in advance or so), this would also improve your LSD-experiences. <br /><br />I&#039;ve done both many times (together, alone or in combo with more products) and I have to say that - as long as you only do it once every few months - I prefer the pure thing. <br />Combo&#039;s are great, but especially when you use more often...<br /><br />Also, if you take the LSD once your peaking on MDMA you&#039;ll never have both peaks at the same time... but that&#039;s exactly the whole point of it (tmho). To peak on the same time you&#039;d have to take the LSD slightly before you take your MDMA (but that depends on your own metabolisme and the way you intend to take them: snort, ingest, shoot, ...). <br /><br />My opinion: try the pure stuff at least once!

				Agree with above posters -- pure compounds first, then combos.

				Oh, talk about right place, right time. <br /><br />I AM ON MY FIRST MDMA EXPERIENCE.<br /><br />Ok, well. I SO badly wanted to candyflip on New Year&#039;s, but wasn&#039;t 100% of the source of my MDMA (while completely confident in the LSD) and didn&#039;t want to chance something horrendous and stupid, so I hadn&#039;t touched the MDMA until tonight. And all for the wrong reasons, really. Had a lousy night last night on a RC, felt the weekend drawing to a close, and thought fuck it. Well, 20, 30 minutes in, felt nothing. Maybe a little off. So I do other stuff, browse the web, read emails, then BAM. 1 hour and 12 minutes after swallowing that little pill I felt WONDERFUL. Like, 0 to 60 in about 6 seconds. It was dramatic. And forgetting, by that point, that I&#039;d taken anything made it even better. I beamed. Got off the damned computer, and started my evening proper (just dropping in here briefly to check on something).<br /><br />So. Having had this experience I can say that it isn&#039;t a &quot;trip&quot; and won&#039;t occupy you, exactly, in the same way, and I had to get that through to myself becauase I&#039;m used to tripping, which is kind of all-encompassing. Whereas I could be playing music, or writing, or doing other stuff while on the MDMA. But I have funky lighting, great music, and I let her rip, and it&#039;s been really great. So while I&#039;m also very keen to candyflip (really the peanut butter and chocolate of the drug world, so perfect), I would definitely try them separately first, partly because (like me) you don&#039;t want to be worried about the quality of your MDMA while you&#039;re tripping on acid, and partly so you can sample those flavours independently and then revel in how they mix.<br /><br />Well, this has been an unusually personal moment on the Road. :)&nbsp; Night.
