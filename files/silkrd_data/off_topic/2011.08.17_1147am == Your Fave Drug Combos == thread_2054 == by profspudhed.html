				thought id start this one, mainly as i found an odd combo that i would have thought would be counter intuitive but for some reason it works, havin been suffering a bit of a bad time the docs put me on ssris, they didnt do me good at all, so i canned them, at this time a friend gave me a strip of valium to take the edge off, but then i had to go back to work, however the day before id had some modafinil arrive, so first thing in the morn i popped 15mg diazepam and 300mg modafinil, a downer and and upper? surely it couldnt work well, but by the gods it did, i felt fantastic, happy, even a bit talkative and on top of all that an utter machine at work. problem is i could REALLY get used to that combo, and i know benzo tolerance builds fast, not sure about the modaf but im willing to bet it could become mighty pricey mighty fast if i started doing it regular, but it sure worked better than the anti depressants the doc gave me. oh and a bit of weed made it even nicer, but then what doesnt weed go well with? (except booze when youve had no weed first, im assuming that synergistic effect has been explored somewhere, basically ive found if you get drunk, then smoke a spliff itll double how drunk you are, usually resulting in spinning out and puking up)<br /><br />others are mdma and speed or another stim to take the sedating effect from the molly, again modafinil may work well here too, and also interestingly although probably dangerously 4-mmc and ket, and of course a good old candyflip

				were not anymore dude, after the hell those celexa put me through i vowed never to touch an ssri again and havent since, especially since i found out they stop you tripping and make it unsafe to take molly, both of which i love. granted no one comes along to tell me itll make me drop dead at any min i may well stick with the modaf/benzo combo instead, its not so much a high, it just makes me feel like i belong in the world with all the other people again if that makes any sense at all, expensive maybe but certainly effective for my own personal brand of misery<br /><br />i do however smoke weed everyday, i have for over 15 years and ill probably keep doing it till the day i die, but normally i forget to include the weed in any combos i list as its just something i dont really even think of as a drug if you will. and i very very rarely drink, i used to then i lived and worked in a pub and for some reason i stopped all together, im not a big fan of it anyway and the next day fallout is worse on booze than anything else ive ever done (if im right its also one of the worst drugs for you physically) and there has been a lot of booze hounds in my family, both my dad and his mother were done in by the booze, in fact my old man essentially chose to be, he failed his liver twice then quit for 6 months on the docs advice, he eventually decided that it had taken what made his life enjoyable away and was happier to drink again than not and gain a few extra years, he lived a good 3 years after that and never regretted his decision and i respect that to a point<br /><br />@uber1337hax<br /><br />shrooms and acid, why have i never done that? definitely now on my list, also come the season if anyone should care to list uk liberty caps ill buy loads, they are in my opinion the best shroom but every site round here is well known and gets raped before my lazy ass is out of bed (and you cant grow them like you can other shrooms, they need special conditions which would require a lot of pricey equipment and mycology knowhow, sods law aint it)

				E+LSD is pretty good as long as you don&#039;t get too fucked up to get the timing right. Have to get to your plateau on the acid then pop the E. Also, weed pretty much goes with everything. It is also great for tapering off some of the stomach troubles that come along with some RCs. MDMA and coke (aka candy flipping) is good if you have enough coke to last through your E trip. I have heard ketamine and E go well together but I have yet to try that.

				@digitalalch<br /><br />sounds like you have a recipe for awesomeness right there, i like very much<br /><br />@reddead<br /><br />now im not 100% sure where i read this info but i remember reading that cannabis increases the intranasal bioavailability of cocaine so ensure you smoke first then snort, but personally coke doesnt have nearly enough oomph for me, if im having a line of a stim i want it to blow my face off and coke has never done that to me (despite it blowing the minds of my friends) ive tried stuff that mates paid £120 a gram for, they all seemed to be totally wrecked off it while to me it was just a bit &quot;meh&quot;

				@profspudhead - Interesting you should say that. I found out it to be true, if you smoke the bud before the coke, it&#039;s a lot better!

				I&#039;m not necessarily trying to recommend this, but a speedball (IV cocaine and heroin) has got to be one of the best feelings ever. I absolutely LOVE the synergy of these two drugs, although I try to avoid frequently doing this.
