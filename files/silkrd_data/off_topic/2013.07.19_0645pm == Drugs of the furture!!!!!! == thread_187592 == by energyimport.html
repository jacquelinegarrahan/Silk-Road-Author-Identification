				Hey guys so what do you guys think drugs will be like 20 50 100 500 etc years from now. <br /><br />Over the past few years we have seen an explosion of various RC&#039;s that have been designed to mimic the current popular drugs and some that were designed to give you a taste of something new. <br /><br />But as technology and science advance we discover more about physics, how our brain works or even other dimension (if you want to go that far out with it) <br /><br />The craziest thing I can think of is some time in the future there will be lasers you shoot at your brain that will trigger highs from anything like MDMA DMT LSD ETC ETC But I also think (and this could be way way way in the future) but will create some type of substance that can transport us to either a different dimension (something like DMT but much more manageable) or even recreate death and take you to the after life but bring you back.<br /><br />What do you guys think?

				I definetly agree on the lasers,&nbsp; or maybe a machine&nbsp; where you can pick what effects you would like with what intensity.&nbsp; I&#039;d think that it would be something watch-like that you put on your wrist and is hooked up to your bloodstream.&nbsp; I have no doubt that there will be some new form of art that makes large interactive room installations that mimic certain drugs such as LSD or DMT.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also think that technology will improve enough that it will be very hard to distrubute illegal drugs and very easy to test for drugs.&nbsp; I think that fake alternatives will take over the market then.&nbsp; I also hope that MJ gets legalized :/<br /><br />There should also be some new crazy drug out that the government takes a while to outlaw. Before that it will explode across the world&nbsp; ;D<br />

				See I like to think that we are advancing as a species on being more accepting of drug usage-&nbsp; a friend of mine is a die hard believer in technological singularity- the belief that in a few decades the computing power of artificial machines will outstrip the computing power of the human mind.<br /><br />along these lines I like to sometimes muse that AI and computers could be the next stage of &quot;human&quot; evolution.&nbsp; so far we only see evolution as a changing of GENETIC codes but what if the real next stage is somehow codifying consciousness into a digital computing form?&nbsp; thereby improving and evolving even our own genetic code&#039;s limitations.<br /><br />if i lost you, think about it this way:&nbsp; we are only three-dimensional creatures right?&nbsp; some people say the fourth dimension is time- but what would that look like?&nbsp; would we be like worms stretching from our birth as an embryonic cell down to our death and dispersion? or maybe the fourth dimension is consciousness?&nbsp; what would &quot;consciousness&quot; look like if we could perceive it? what new senses would we need? the answer is: we have no clue!!&nbsp; (if you get this part then keep reading, if you don&#039;t then i recommend this video called &quot;Imagining the 10th Dimension&quot; to get my point&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q_GQqUg6Ts<br /><br />ANYWAY:&nbsp; in much the same way we can&#039;t even conceive what a 4D being would be, I don&#039;t believe we could conceive (or outrule) evolution as jumping from genetic information to digital information- why is that anymore ridiculous than random proteins linking into chains that give people blonde hair or brown eyes?<br /><br />Along these same line- why should it be illegal for someone to use drugs if it makes them a better contributor to the advancement of humanity?&nbsp; if when i take adderal i can complete work in a third of the time, why shouldn&#039;t i be permitted to take or use adderal whenever I want to?&nbsp; if i were to use marijuana at night to sleep and it helped me feel more restful or deal with stress and i remained more functional or equally functional in the morning but improved my outlook and general happiness, why should it be illegal?<br /><br />No i think the future of drugs will be when we all loosen up and realize how that these substances can be beneficial- maybe that&#039;s by creating lasers or direct stimulations to the brain which reduce or eliminate negative sideeffects but I don&#039;t believe it will be a race to see who can test better and screw each other over more.&nbsp; i think the next generations will make some big pushes towards legalizing some substances and hopefully deregulating others.<br /><br />i am a super optomist in this regard lol i realize this... but hey i wont be around to see it so what does it matter?

I swear after watching it I was trying to look for a drug similar to it, at least a stimulant that helps focus and what not. I think the closest to it would be Modafinil or Ritalin... What do you think? <br /><br />seriously if there was a drug out there like that... wew...&nbsp; loved that movie
