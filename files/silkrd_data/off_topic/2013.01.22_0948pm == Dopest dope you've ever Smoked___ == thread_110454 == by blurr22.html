				This is research. I&#039;ve proposed my question, just looking for entertaining experiences and answers. A lot of information on SR is redundant, and sometimes doesn&#039;t appear legit. maybe i should have left it at just the most potent strains people have ever smoked with experiences. The other stuff wasn&#039;t necessary, my bad... Why does everybody seem to hate &quot;newbs&quot; so much? you were born a &quot;full member&quot;?

				first, no. that&#039;s not research. that&#039;s asking someone to do your homework for you.<br /><br />I&#039;m willing to suffer the hail of -karma I&#039;ll undoubtedly garner, but here&#039;s the thing(s):<br /><br />1. no grown adult wants to sit here and read/tell stories of &quot;oh dude bro I was soooooooo high this one time...&quot; and if for some reason they do, they know they can pop in to the Off Topic thread or even the Rumor Mill thread to go read smoke reports from the different high quality vendors here on SR.<br /><br />2. you can search the internet for websites like *clearnet* leafly.com or medicalmarijuanastrains.com that have comprehensive reports on hundreds of strains from thousands of smokers. this forum has a search function like that too, which is also easy to use.<br /><br />I apologize for sounding harsh, but this is that shit I don&#039;t like.

				G13 strain years ago. <br /><br />I have never seen anyone drop a 1gram bud into a bowl and hear it thud against the bowl the way it did. It hardly moved, just dropped and stayed, was weird.<br /><br />Also a strain called Crimson Red, years ago also, full of red hairs. 8)

				you do have a choice to not read/comment.<br /><br />ramrugger that’s not harsh`, just your opinion.

Don&#039;t you know how totally ridiculous it is of you to ask other drug users on an anonymous drug forum about their favorite drugs? I mean, come on. /s<br /><br />My favorite from SR has been some Chemdawg from BajoZero. I ordered an 1/8th and got 4 grams in a single huge bud. The smell and taste were unparalleled, save for perhaps the NYC Diesel I got just recently from FarmerBob.<br /><br />I tend to prefer heavy indicas over sativas, but I sometimes enjoy sativa blends. Don&#039;t worry about the fainting, Everyone&#039;s body chemistry differs. I have had panic attacks from a strong sativa before. Not fun! I felt so wound up that I couldn&#039;t sit still, and if I tried, it was bad news. It also exacerbated some permanent physical pain I have, but on the contrary indicas tend to help get my muscles to relax and ease my pain just a little.<br /><br />Those clearnet review sites that were posted here are legit if you haven&#039;t yet seen them, by the way.<br /><br />Cheers mate!

				To many to choose just one all have their place for different times of the day and different environments and your frame of mind at the time or if your just a medicinal user well you choose the effects to help your ailment, its best to have a few different strains in your stash jars of both sativas and indicas both hash and weed then you never get sick because no matter how good the strain may be if that&#039;s all you have to smoke after a couple of weeks or less you will be so sick of it to the point it actually depresses you to have to smoke it.<br /><br />Weed is truly amazing when used correctly but getting your hands on the cream well that&#039;s up to you!<br />

				I agree with a few of those already stated; some potent strains being tossed around nowadays.<br /><br />My personal favorite of the contemporary strains tho is hands down my baby: Blue Dream!<br /><br />can&#039;t get enough, it&#039;s just the perfect blend and high for me.<br />hands down - the dopest dope I&#039;ve ever smoked!<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />also recently smoked on this straight evil looking, so purple it&#039;s black, strain called Black Chernobyl, that was real powerful

				<br />I’m going to have to sample these strains noted and experience them for myself. I don’t think I would have looked into sampling any of them on my own prior because of the variety around. its nice to get direct references and Thank yall.&nbsp; I do think growers are getting somewhat ridiculous with the genetics now a day; with all of these different variations that seem randomly cross bred. I look forward to the day the US feds get involved in growing weed. Imagine the possibilities of the strains that can be developed under extremely controlled environments by highly experienced scientists with unlimited resources and nothing to lose. <br /><br />Isthereanyneed I agree with everything you say, but have you have found that one though? You know weed is like women; there’s many; you’d have anyone that’s relatively attractive on any given day, but until you’ve found that one, it will always become a bore after a few weeks of fun. <br /><br />“Black Chernobyl” ? Nice!
