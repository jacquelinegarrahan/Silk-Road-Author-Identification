				The mailman came by and dropped a package into my mailbox.<br /><br />I went out and happily brought in my package and placed it on the table. I went to the toilet and came back to open my new arrival.<br /><br />As I walk by the window I notice a police car stop out the front of my home.<br /><br />I thought I would shit myself but luckily had just finished one.<br /><br />I ran to grab my stash to flush down the toilet but hesitated at the thought of losing my shit.<br /><br />Luckily the cops went into the house next door.

				I was coming home from the post office this week with an SR package on the seat next to me, and a bag of weed that I&#039;d picked up IRL and forgotten to put away in my house, when the cops jumped out and pulled me over. Turns out they were just checking people for seatbelts and burned out headlights and paperwork, but I was a little nervous for a minute. All my papers were in order, and I was joking with the cop about how expensive headlight bulbs are when he told me to get out of the way so he could deal with the next guy.<br /><br />So I know how you feel.

				It&#039;s always best to keep the package for a little while unopened somewhere writing &quot;return to sender&quot; upon it for more security.<br />In the case LE will bust at your door a short while after receiving the package you have deniability in this way. If you have opened it either if you flush the content (bu in most cases you will neither have the possibility to do so) down the toilet it is A) very easy that they did already know what was in there anyway (and usually they changed it with some inert substance), B) you opened the package and got the content so actually proving you knew what there was inside.

				IRL? What are you, a Swedish prosecutor?<br /><br />You mean AFK, I believe. Away from keyboard. I don&#039;t stop believing this is real life. It may be a &quot;virtual&quot; world, but it is certainly real.<br /><br />Anyway, I just got of the red phone to make a payment the other day. I turned to walk to the cashier, and two detectives walked in, and they eye fucked me. Luckily, in breaking the silence, one of them said, &quot;I hope they have my wife&#039;s prescription...&quot; And I paid and left promptly.

				That is a horrible coincidence. It is something good to keep in mind. Seeing LE pull up would be nerve wracking for anyone. But it&#039;s good to keep in mind they might have other business. Or what they&#039;re coming about might be completely unrelated. Hm it is food for thought though.

Having him as a friend has given me motivation to not only keep the place spotless, but also to improve my narco-management. The most important thing, whatever the situation, is stress management, so that you don&#039;t give away signs of panic, but also problem solving.<br /><br />Stay safe.
