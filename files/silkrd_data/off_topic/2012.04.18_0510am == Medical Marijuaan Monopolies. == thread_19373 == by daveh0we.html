				Well Im just so sick of it.&nbsp; Somehow Marijuana is ok when its for someone with a piece of paper, but not ok for someone without a piece of paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further more I know that after taxes Marijuana at a dispensary is a Jip, and we capitalize on this failure to treat people right.<br /><br />Watch American Weed, on National Geographic, watch all of them.&nbsp; you need some lsd or mushrooms so you can see through their BS.&nbsp; &nbsp; The colorado boys are fat cat white collar scum.&nbsp; &nbsp;They openly admit that they fund a taskforce that drives around steals their competitors (non permitted growers) marijuana and destroys it.<br /><br />Then those douche bags on Weed Wars.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Steve goes to a marijuana rally, w/ &quot;The most potent edibles because hes nervous about his speech&quot;&nbsp; At the same time he sends A grown man in a dress, and an accountant to city hall to argue for their business.&nbsp; It&#039;s pathetic.&nbsp; Too tired to finnish but am hoping another woken up soul can continue the critiquing of these&nbsp; &nbsp;fat cat lobbiests and there BS Medical Monopoly.&nbsp; I am so glad SR has come.&nbsp; We needed an agoreist market and now we have many.

				I used to sell to a clinic and got really close with all of the workers as well as the owner but he was obviously very hush-hush about his books, well turns out he owns 3 clinics in LA and makes ~$1 million a year. So yeah I know what you&#039;re talking about, a lot of people think clinics are there for patients and that they only take &quot;donations.&quot;

				I was watching &quot;American Weed&quot;. <br /><br />&nbsp; The colorado boys kept saying&nbsp; We dont want any of our weed to go to the black market.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well there is a scene where some of the boys &quot;over watered&quot; some plants and those plants had to be disposed of.&nbsp; The Bad Boss Boy yelled at the two lackie boys for fucking up.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was all an act, yeah the plants looked sick.&nbsp; &nbsp;I grew up around greenhouses, and horticulture (Legal vegetables, Legal Flowers).&nbsp; &nbsp;I know the two men in my life who are pro gardeners could bring those plants back to life, and if they could im sure the Colorado boys can too.&nbsp; Obviously those plants where headed to the black market.&nbsp; &nbsp;So now the White FatCat colorado Boys are GreySuit schumbuckets,&nbsp; W/ there non medical marijuana task force that they openly fund.<br /><br /><br />Oh how about that FoodSaver bag of&nbsp; L.A.

				I don&#039;t see whats wrong with the Medical Marijuana industry. I do feel that there are definitely some people who are greedy about it and don&#039;t want legislation to push to full legalization, but there&#039;s gonna be greedy bastards in any kind of lucrative enterprise. <br /><br />But these things, especially those television shows, are showing people like my parents that marijuana isn&#039;t a big deal. And thats the big thing. Because in the end, the majority of voters, are those average conservative parents. <br />Also, because of the medical marijuana industry there has been an influx of weed. Just in the past two years, amazing marijuana has become quite prevelant. At first it was expensive, but the price has been going down, and for a non medical state i feel thats pretty awesome. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see whats up with all the hate. Each year, politicians are getting more and more tolerant to the idea of changing legislation on marijuana. This November there&#039;s multiple states that have Legalization on the bill. <br />That is fucking awesome to me. <br /><br />I totally support the production and smoking of marijuana and marijuana concentrates. Thats all there is too it man.<br /><br />Also, dispensaries don&#039;t tax that much man. I live in a state where people are cool with paying 45$-50$ an eighth for really good weed, and my friend just moved to Colorado, where on Fridays his dispensaries sell 30$ 1/4&#039;s of shake.<br />He got a 30$ quarter of White widow shake, an he said half of it was just little pebble nugs. <br /><br />But hey, thats just like, my opinion man

				&quot;But hey, thats just like, my opinion man&quot; alright dude lol. I live in a medical state and have seen both sides of it. I had a amazing hookup for over a year that eventually quit talking to me and my friends because he was &quot;to legit&quot;, he was the head grower for 3 of the biggest dispensaries in the state and had created &quot;Medicine Man&quot; if anyone has heard of that strain. I have also met tons of people with cards that can&#039;t wait to be able to not renew because it can really screw you over in certain situations. I understand where your anger is coming from but if your goal, like the rest of us, is to have weed be legalized then you should realize there will be some kind of monopoly behind it.
