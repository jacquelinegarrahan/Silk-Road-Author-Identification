				I am experiencing problems at the moment with the company Bitinstant and I know they will be back on their feet eventually with me after a stern talking to. But my customers on the street are very demanding for MDMA that is as good as Tomorrowmans. I am 100% Good for it, There are a few on the forums who will back me up on my word. Anyway I understand if it&#039;s not a possibility but It would be greatly appreciated and I will be able to pay you back as soon as I get my errors corrected with Bitinstant.

				I bought mine using PayPal.&nbsp; The good thing is PayPal doesn&#039;t know what the hell you&#039;re buying.&nbsp; You&#039;re just sending money to another individual with a PayPal account.&nbsp; Although the price is inflated somewhat..(not too bad.)&nbsp; From signup to to buying and finishing the transaction it was only about 15 minutes.&nbsp; Just look for a reputable seller.&nbsp; You can filter the sellers by those who are online as well filter them by payment types accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />I used Bitinstant too before.&nbsp; I liked the service.&nbsp; Real breeze when it works.&nbsp; But they really need to get their shit together before I ever consider them again.&nbsp;
