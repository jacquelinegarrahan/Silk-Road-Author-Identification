				So this morning I was randomly dreaming about banging a chick and I woke up right as I came but then I realized that the orgasm was still going on for like ten seconds after waking up. Some of you are going to say that I was simply having a &quot;wet dream&quot; but you&#039;re wrong because it has been scientifically proven that dreaming an orgasm does not cause it to happen physically.<br />I had taken 50mg of MDMA the previous night.<br />Did anyone else experience this? Are there any biology experts here with possible explanations?

				if you haven&#039;t had sex or haven&#039;t ejaculated in a long time then you get wet dreams and your balls will relieve all built up pressure on their own...<br /><br />also...if you&#039;re a teenager it&#039;s just part of puberty....

				I&#039;m a girl, so I don&#039;t really know how that works for men, but I&#039;ve definitely dreamed an orgasm and woke up still having one. It doesn&#039;t happen often, but it&#039;s definitely happened more than once. Lol...
