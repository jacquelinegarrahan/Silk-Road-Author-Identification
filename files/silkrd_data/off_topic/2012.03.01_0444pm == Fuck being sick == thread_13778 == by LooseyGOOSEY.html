				I&#039;ve had a cold for the past few days, a pretty fucking bad cold, too. Congestion, coughing, sneezing, headache, sore throat, etc.<br />But the thing I hate the most about being sick is the rapidly changing body temperature. I was freezing so I put a sweater on, only to over-heat and start sweating minutes later- took it off and started shivering because I was cold, so I put it back on... what the actual fuck?!<br />Can&#039;t my body find some middle-ground here? A nice WARM?<br /><br />Well I decided to take a few bong hits because I feel like shit. New cold filtered water (my bong has two places for water, up top and in the base), and ice in the ice catcher. After two hits I found my body at a stable, comfortable temperature, and my head feels great. Oh, the wonders of herbs!<br /><br />Anyone else find marijuana, or any other recreational drugs, help with this kind of relief?&nbsp; :D

				Sometimes it does, but other times that makes it worse. Eat fruit, drink water, take vitamin C with flavonoids.

				Just a comment on your hot / cold experience - it feels shitty, but layering up and cooking for a bit actually makes me feel a lot better. Keep a thermometer handy to make sure you don&#039;t get hyperthermia, and let your fever go. After about an hour or 2, it peaks and then starts to taper off. Might be easier to do high, as you&#039;ll be less uncomfortable as a result.

I think its a conspiracy governments have spread that coke is not good for you. They use to sell it in the &quot;olden days&quot; lol as a cure for all liquid concoction!&nbsp; (mmmmmmmm liquid concoction ;D)

Uppers in general. Weed is good for getting to sleep, as always, but I would think tripping would make it worse! Although, I always feel much better physically and mentally while and for a few days after tripping. Most drugs tend to intensify any situation though! I&#039;m curious what a dissociative would be like. K-hole with the flu? Hmm.
