				Define &quot;really bad&quot;.<br /><br />Some might not describe them like that at all. In fact, most would describe what it feels like when under the influence of Heroin and Meth as actually being quite the opposite; &quot;really good&quot;. That&#039;s why people take them.<br /><br />The difference between falling into a downwards spiral of drug addiction that ruins a persons life/health isn&#039;t necessarily the drugs fault entirely. It&#039;s self control. Will power. Inner strength. Yes, Heroin is more physically addictive than say, MDMA; which of course will consequently result in higher numbers of addicted users, but it&#039;s largely down to YOU as a person as to whether you&#039;ll fall into that downwards spiral. Some people can try it once, enjoy it, and then leave it alone. Others are mentally weaker, and find it much harder to refuse in spite of the risks/dangers looming over them.<br /><br />I, for the record, have never tried either Heroin or Meth. But still, it seems clear to me why others take them; for the same reason as any other drug.<br /><br />Don&#039;t buy into all of the incessant media propaganda. There are casual Heroin and Meth users out there, who enjoy taking them only on an occasional basis, and live relatively healthy lives with good friends, family and a good job. Trying those drugs once isn&#039;t signing a contractual bind to years of addiction leading to death by vomit-choke.<br /><br />I would like to try them both some day. I believe I have the strength to prevent myself from falling into a downwards spiral (although, I know, you could never truly say that until you&#039;ve tried it).

				There is no such thing as a hard or soft drug. There is no such thing as a bad drug. Drugs only have certain effects and certain side-effects.

				Curiosity. Continuation. Availability. Authenticity.<br />I was abusing Adderall in the name of productivity, buying it locally from a friend. When I became aware of the soft and silky road, I was amazed to see the prices sky high for the pill. I was buying them for 1/3 the price, but my friend only had so many. I did some research and then bought some speed on the basis that it would be a good substitute to Adderall. The fast changing market of Amphetamine sellers and scammers began to appeal less and less to me. Most of it was coming from across the world, taking weeks to arrive, if it did at all. I decided to try some meth. It was amazing how little crystal was required to be the productive, energetic, and elated. I have now bought it numerous times, much to the dismay of my close friends. <br /><br />I have been taking crystal nearly daily for the past month, in small doses (30 mg-50 mg), almost exclusively for times of work. I have noticed that each time I buy it, I am using a little more than last time and noticing a few more physical changes. I have been switching between smoking, snorting, and oral administration. I have never seen something change me so fast. While I am doing the best work I have ever done in my life, there are side-effects that I have seen even in this short month of use. My sleep schedule has become a complete mess. My nose is definitely starting to take a toll, the shards burn like hellfire. And I cant stop clenching my jaw. My face is becoming gaunt.<br /><br />I do it because I thought it would be a good substitute to Adderall and that I would be able to control my intake. That is not the case. I may have been doing it in small doses but it sure as hell is not a substance I can be responsible with. My intake is unacceptable and I must stop. I am not buying any for at least 4 months, starting with many hours of consistent sleep during this coming holiday. It already sounds nice. The last time I had none, I spent 12-14 hours sleeping each day, an effect of the withdrawal. My motivation level will not be the same for a few months. <br /><br />The funny thing is, I am very weary of opiates and have no intention of trying heroin. I find it scary and see it as a very expensive, dangerous drug. Why I felt so comfortable with meth is because I had steps to climb up to the &quot;hard drug&quot;. Adderall, speed, meth. With such a high chance of abuse, I need to learn to honor my own boundaries with things as dangerous as these. I know I have the willpower, I just need to focus it. <br /><br />Everything in moderation. EVERYTHING in moderation.

I assumed the OP was asking &quot;why do people even try Heroin/Meth in the first place? They&#039;re really bad drugs&quot;. I was simply trying to say you won&#039;t pick up a strong physical addiction that ruins your life from trying them just once. You may, however, have such an amazing experience that you decide you want to keep experiencing it - in which case you very well could pick up a strong physical addiction that may eventually ruin your life - UNLESS you have the willpower to refuse yourself that experience in the knowledge that you could become addicted.<br /><br />I&#039;m not at all saying I don&#039;t believe physical addiction exists; OF COURSE it does. But at the same time, if you don&#039;t think willpower is a huge factor... That, to me, is ridiculous. An addict has the ability to choose not to ever take another mg of Heroin again; it just might be the most fucking hard thing they&#039;ve ever had to face because of that addiction. But the choice is there, whether or not you have the willpower to pull through the withdrawal.

So really I think Ballz is on point (a mahf, like always), drugs are subjective much like life, what you perceive to be harmful most likely will be.

It usually stems from a personal problem that drives you to do to much of the drug. In my case I have to do a drug quite a bit on a daily basis to feel the slightest bit of withdrawls. I am blessed to be able to kill out any kind of withdrawl just by smoking some weed but I know that weed isn&#039;t for everyone but I wouldn&#039;t give it up in exchange for a clinic or anything. Fuck a bunch of roxies I&#039;ll get them anytime I want them without walking the line.
