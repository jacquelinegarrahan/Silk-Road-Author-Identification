				More than 100,000 ecstasy pills found buried in woods in Ibiza were hidden by an alleged drugs gang smashed in the summer, police believe.<br /><br />The designer drugs were found by a walker who noticed part of a plastic bag sticking-out of the ground in woods on the edge of Sant Josep, just south of the resort of San Antonio. Police found a total of 113,000 ecstasy pills weighing 37 kilos inside waterproof plastic bags.<br /><br />Officers from the Civil Guard said yesterday that it was believed that the drugs had been hidden by members of a gang smashed on the holiday island in August in a series of swoops codenamed Operation Arrow.<br />article_mpuAdvertisement<br /><br />The paramilitary police force, working in conjunction with SOCA, Britain&#039;s criminal intelligence agency, arrested a total of 20 people and seized 38,000 ecstasy pills, small amounts of other designer drugs and four kilos of cocaine, worth 168,000 pounds at street level.<br /><br />Eighteen of the Britons, who came from Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and London, were either sent to jail or placed on bail after appearing before an investigating judge.<br /><br />They were accused of selling drugs to young holidaymakers in San Antonio on the island&#039;s west coast.<br /><br />The outfit consisting mainly of teenagers were caught with tens of thousands of pounds of drugs, two guns and all terrain vehicles during the sting.<br /><br /><br />http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2010/11/02/merseyside-gang-linked-to-discovery-of-100-000-ecstacy-pills-found-in-ibiza-woodland-100252-27582137/

				I wouldn&#039;t really say there are woods on Ibiza.....If you consider a few olive trees and ever greens a forest, then maybe yes...I remember hearing stories about kilos of coke washing up on the Ibiza beaches.The Balearic Islands are a transit point into Europe, so you will be able to find pretty much anything there.In any-case, 100k pills is a drop in the bucket for the Island. If you have ever been, you would know what I&#039;m talking about.I was paying 2-3 euro a pill last time I was there. In the clubs they will be sold for around 10. I remember grabbing off a bartender in very famous club there. That Island is a free for all, although it has calmed down significantly the past few years.

				I&#039;m in two minds about this, one part of me is saying that&#039;s one hell of a lot of love gone to waste, the other side is saying perhaps it was for the best, none of us will ever know if these pills were adulterated with something nasty, such as Piperazine, or worse PMA otherwise known as &#039;Dr Death&#039;. I&#039;ve read pill quality in Ibiza has been declining for a number of years, perhaps indirectly a few lives were saved, we&#039;ll never know. I have to agree with Ahoyhoy, it is far out a non drug user found these pills, if I found them, I&#039;d conduct a marquis reagent test, if all was well I&#039;d go out on a life long mission to spread as much &#039;free love&#039; as I possibly could :)

I&#039;ve read pill quality in Ibiza has been declining for a number of years, perhaps indirectly a few lives were saved, we&#039;ll never know. I have to agree with Ahoyhoy, it is far out a non drug user found these pills, if I found them, I&#039;d conduct a marquis reagent test, if all was well I&#039;d go out on a life long mission to spread as much &#039;free love&#039; as I possibly could :) </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> A lovely idea indeed but you&#039;d probably be killed by dealers for ruining their business :-\ </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> In this scenario perhaps there&#039;s a way of extracting the MDMA from these pills to create a new pill? I&#039;d never want to steal from anyone, however I&#039;d never hand it over to the law, they&#039;ve already stolen enough of our drugs and I&#039;ll be damned to add to their huge stash! Realistically your suggestion is the best Ballzinator, especially from a safety and security standpoint.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Get out of my brain, Princess! I swear I had the idea of extracting and re-pressing a minute before reading your post :o
