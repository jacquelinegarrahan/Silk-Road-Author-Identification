				@TheIllusiveDave its only about 1mg really nothing at all.<br /><br />Lol Bruce if you say so. Hahah &#039;&#039;yes eat the xanax&#039;&#039;. Ok. I do anything anyone tells me so since you say that, I shall. Have you guys noticed any nice effects from combining xanax with weed? Ive done it before but havent payed attention. What do you guys think?

They pack a punch but there&#039;s no escaping that alprazolam taste. Blehhh chewy candy and water makes it chillin though.<br /><br />I feel like such a boss sometimes having access to the Road...<br />People are always like &#039;&#039;No way howd you get that wtf!!&#039;&#039; And I&#039;ve only made 2 purchases!

				I&#039;m very sorry to hear that brother. Why just the other day I was high on 25i-nbome, well the other night actually took it around 11pm, didn&#039;t sleep at all that night/morning until the night that day...Lol. I did have weed but it didn&#039;t do much for sleeping aid.<br /><br />I decided to stay up all night, listening to a trance/dance/dubstep/houseparty music mix someone I know made..ill share it with you guys if anyone wants it; it&#039;s so good and especially for 25i/acid/ecstacy/weed or if your just into that music. Sorry I got off track. I stayed up and watched the sunrise from my bed..it was beautiful. I have shutter windows i can see shit outside, it was an&nbsp; amazing experience on acid and weed.

But ever since my acid trip on 1&amp;2/3 1000microgram blotters I got an intense inner monologue about ciggerettes and taking care of my body...which all has been forgotten about besides the cigs. So no more stoagies for me no sir.

				Can one of you guys answer this one?<br /><br />There was a vendor named something like cincamon, or cinnamon who had bulk adderall the cheapest you could find on SR. Do any of you know what happened to him?<br /><br />I figure he must be on vacation but I would like to know his real profile name so I can search him up and see what is going on because I am dying to get in some adderall. (all the other adderall on here are at crazy prices)

				wow.........Whenever confronted with the question should i take this drug i always counter with why the hell not?&nbsp; My life has been full of amazing stories.&nbsp; I have experienced a vast number of feelings and sensations, I&#039;ve seen many strange visuals and other things a vast majority of the world will never see or feel in their lifetime.&nbsp; A majority of the world will die never knowing what the rush of pure pleasure from the IV heroin injection, The rush of serotonin from pure Molly, The blue tentacles that my arms became after eating an eighth of the best shrooms in the world and watching the yellow submarine.&nbsp; I could go on for days.&nbsp; My point........yes.&nbsp; Always, always say yes.
