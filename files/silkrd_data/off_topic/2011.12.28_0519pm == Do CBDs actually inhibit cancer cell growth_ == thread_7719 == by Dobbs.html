				It appears it has some anti-cancer cell properties. Start with the references in the CBD wikipedia article, there are six, and from there check the references and you&#039;ll be able to find any studies that examine the effects of CBD on cancer cells.

				Check out google scholar and enter &quot;cannabidiol effects on cancer cells&quot;. There is a lot there to read up on. <br /><br />There is also some data on cancer.gov<br /><br />http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/cannabis/healthprofessional/page4<br /><br />I have a family member in Venezuela who is terminal (pancreatic) and he gave up; stopped treatment and decided to die on his own terms (which I agreed with). We convinced him to try some Indica strains that were havested late (indicas are already high in cbd and late harvest increases further). Docs gave him 1 month; its been 6 so far. I&#039;m not trying to say it cured him but it seems to have inhibited growth of the tumor for the time being and improved his quality of life since now he can get out of the house because he is no longer attached to the IV morphine all day. <br /><br />Either way there is still a lot to learn about marijuana.
