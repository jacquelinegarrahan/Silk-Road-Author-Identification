				I hear ya kitkat.&nbsp; when I see &quot;in transit&quot; that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;m thinking.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s interesting because from what I can tell alot of the worries and issues that happen on SR basicly come from the escrow system not being used properly, for example buyers who FE or vendors putting orders in transit before they are actually shipped etc..&nbsp; I&#039;m not judging anybody or our vendors it just seems like alot of shit could be avoided if this system was used properly.&nbsp; Either way I&#039;m glad you got your package today and be sure to get nice and fucked up for me&nbsp; ;D

				LOL, yeah.&nbsp; I will try.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think that they are bad people or even bad vendors or anything like that for marking in tramnsit early.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just wish that when I message them and ask &quot;hey, did you send it out on the day you said you sent it&quot; and then they straight up lie and then rush to the post office hoping that I am stupid as hell and won&#039;t notice the postmarked date.&nbsp; That is what drives me bonkers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I just wish that they could admit that they forgot.&nbsp; I am a very forgiving person, and I understand that shit happens.&nbsp; I am willing to bet that most other people on SR are the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t mean I won&#039;t order again, or that I will complain.&nbsp; Hell, I forget to do something important pretty much on a daily basis!
