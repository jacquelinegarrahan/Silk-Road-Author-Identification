				Limetless is selling good mephedrone from the UK. His &#039;ultra crystal&#039; stuff is apparently meant to blow all other meph out the water. I haven&#039;t tried it yet but Ive had some normal meph from him before and even that blew my socks off!<br />

				Well if you&#039;re gunna go for his ultra cystal then I&#039;d say crush up a ~75mg line to whack up your nose (pretty bad to snort but worth it fo&#039;sure). About the size of a match! Prepare for it to hit you within 10minutes and you&#039;ll get a nice, euphoric, warm, exciting rush! Its best used socially and to your favorite music. You&#039;ll want to dance like crazy and chat your ass off.<br />It last about 30minutes and its easily topped up to the same level with about another 30mg line!

				sounds good. i guess i&#039;ll try limitless if I go for meph. or maybe BM&#039;s Speed. He has awesome reputations. Unfort. I got a high tolerance for speed atm. will it affect the dosage of the meph?

				Good question, I can&#039;t say for sure but I think I&#039;m right in saying there is no cross tolerance between the two so you should be absolutely fine. :)
