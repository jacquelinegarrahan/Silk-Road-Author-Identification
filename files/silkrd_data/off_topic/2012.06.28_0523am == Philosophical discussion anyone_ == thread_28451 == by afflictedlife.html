				Here is an idea to start the ball rolling; <br />Is true freedom worth the price of opening everyone up more completely to the worst of human nature?<br />I&#039;ll check back in tomorrow and see if anyone replied at all.<br />but now for sleep, I abandon the internet.<br />Do not go gentle into that good night SR

Or alternatively if the diamond could be split down and and go on to adorn a dress but having that diamond sequin effect makes what would be a £2000 wedding dress into a £4000 dress because of the work that goes into and more importantly because that is fashionable at the time. Or it could be only worth £500 to a jeweler in Dubai who recognizes the crystal structure (diamonds can be ID&#039;d because they have different structures depending on where they are formed in the world) and knows it has blood all over it. <br /><br />Everything is subjective. :)

				I loved reading the arc of conversation. You all went in every direction its hard to know what to touch on next. I guess I will start by rephrasing the first question:<br />In a hypothetical world where everyone is completely free to do or say anything they may. a world without laws or restrictions acceptable on conduct.&nbsp; would said world be better or worse for being exposed to the full unfiltered range of human behavior? for example; a child molester, a cannibal, a teacher and a physician being equally accepted and free to pursue whatever they wish.<br />now to sleep again.<br /><br />“I think insomnia is a sign that a person is interesting.”<br />― Avery Sawyer, Notes to Self

When capitalism so utterly dominates the economic practice of every sovereign nation on earth save North Korea and Cuba, how anyone can claim with a straight face that capitalism is dead is baffling.<br /><br />Usually a system is declared dead when it&#039;s replaced by an alternative system. There isn&#039;t a viable alternative to capitalism right now ... there just isn&#039;t. And just like other systems, capitalism has its strengths and weaknesses. Its the job of governments to reign in the excesses of unrestrained neo-liberal, laissez-faire capitalism which when run amok can result in destructive characteristics harmful to the society practicing it. It sounds like your gripe is with the systems of government that have so far failed to reign in the latest iterations of capitalist excesses than with capitalism itself.<br /><br />IMO, pinning all of the world&#039;s problems on the economic system of private ownership that forms the basis of capitalism is just silly. For instance:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At the moment we have the resources and capabilities to shelter, food and clothe the entire population 3x&#039;s over.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To blame starvation on capitalism instead of politics is missing the forest for the trees. If you&#039;re going to cite such an example, why do you conveniently ignore that capitalism deserves some credit for the steep climbs in output that have allowed us to produce enough food, shelter, and clothing for the world&#039;s population 3x over?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We have the technology to reduce our pollution to near zero.<br />However this will never happen. WHY?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, your gripe should be focused on the politics that have prevented green tech from proliferating rather than an economic system like capitalism that acts as a driver of bringing new ideas in green technology to market just as much as it drives the dirty energy market. Capitalism itself is neutral in this regard.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Because technological advancements are hindered and completely controlled by profit motive.<br />Capitalism is in fact restraining advancements in technology as those in power will do whatever necessary to ensure a new product does not enter the market that will undercut their earnings.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />While I have no doubt that moneyed interests do play a significant role in repressing some technologies that are more environmentally friendly, to make a blanket claim accusing capitalism of restraining technological advancements is just silly. In many cases, capitalism and profit motives are responsible for bringing products to market that are of great benefit to the world. Not always, but to write off the entire capitalist system as dead just because some elements of capitalism need fine tuning and regulation is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. IMO, it&#039;s just brainless and lazy.<br /><br />Now don&#039;t even get me started on your claim that rationalism is dead because of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; ???

				You&#039;re forgetting one very important thing... WE ARE HUMANS<br /><br />We aren&#039;t some perfect species that will suddenly start living in harmony with the Earth. It is our NATURE to be this corrupt. Whether you think so or not, it obviously is. Or perhaps we should learn from the Ancient cultures that were apparently so aligned with the Earth, and start sacrificing babies and owning slaves again?<br /><br />Maybe if there was some mass revolution of consciousness we could live without money.. But money is just an abstraction of services/resources. And we are abstract creatures. It&#039;s always going to happen.<br /><br />You are asking humans to suddenly stop being human. <br /><br />Stop living in the clouds, this shit is DEEP DEEP DEEP in our nature. Whether we have a deeper nature that is more in harmony with the universe.. perhaps I would agree with you. But it certainly isn&#039;t the mode of operation for 99.99% of us. <br /><br />So revolution of consciousness comes first, and then when we NATURALLY EVOLVE into a system of no money, then that&#039;s cool.<br /><br />But right now, you&#039;re talking about the very unpleasant primate species to which we belong, and the self interested fantasies it will continue to generate, one of which is the system of politics.

				In all probability our species will most likely kill itself off prior to any Utopia manifesting itself. This is the nature of our species, as a matter of fact. What else could be the nature of organisms existing in a universal, infinite singularity, whose contents are those stolen from the immediately preceding moments? What else could we be but creatures that posit ourselves so absolutely we can strive for nothing else but our own deaths? <br /><br />In accepting the early tribal forms of male/female dichotomous social hierarchy we established patterns of repetition which could both allow us to progress to unforeseen heights as well as cause a great deal of suffering. The belief that because we are an evolved form of electrical activity and are thus somehow superior is completely subjective. Subjectivity is complete bullshit- partiality imparts a degree of subjectivity to all matters, but it is in the objective, molded only with the stains of interpretation, that we may find a suitably irrational solution to the horrors of our daily rationalities. <br /><br />Technology imparts either detachment or complete involvement and participation in all forms of media. &quot;All media work us over completely.&quot; Whether you choose to accept capitalism, communism, or otherwise, is ultimately irrelevant, as we are constantly in the midst of a civil war, which we are either losing or winning- depending upon the interpretation. <br /><br />We will kill ourselves before we kill the earth, and it is likely that we will realize this potentiality very short periods of time from now (biologically speaking). <br /><br />Perhaps honey bees, or potatoes, will be he next evolved species? If we as human beings have proven anything, it is that potatoes can certainly conduct electrical activity- and at the very least are good for a cheap Christmas dollar(: <br /><br />To those of you who love moolah, cash, greenbacks, verdant sliders, wet ones, wetbacks, the ever lovin&#039; dollar, that stuff that you can&#039;t eat but need to live (?), <br /><br />Enjoy the path to your own death, as I am certainly enjoying mine(:

				In a way, I kinda like the world as it is because apart from technology advancing that&#039;s all that will change. <br /><br />Regarding our political systems and the status quo, I personally have just come to accept it for what it is. Humans are by their very nature corrupt and greedy so why fight it? Take for example everybody&#039;s favourite bug-bear here. Legalisation. Does anyone REALLY believe that anything will change even if that happened? Nah would it fuck. The government that did it wouldn&#039;t let us all become potential millionaires overnight for shit, that&#039;s just fucking naive. What they would do instead is issue licenses like they do any other illegal drug and let people like Pfizer and all the rest of them monopolise the shit out of it and then we would be pissed off that they were making junkies and it being corrupt as fuck and taking all the cheddar. In reality, under prohibition we actually retain a certain level on control over the drug trade even though it brings all sorts of negatives. You&#039;d be simply trading that for some sort of weird fucked-up Brave-New-World scenario. Nuts to that. <br /><br />Also when people say &quot;Yeah Communism would work&quot;.....if it was gunna it would have by now. Look at what happens when the state is already intruding on your ass under a &quot;Democratic&quot; system in comparison to say....Soviet Russia, or present day China or even fucking worse North fucking Korea where shit really is 1984. Problem with socialism is that once the revolution is over and all that worker freedom and all that shit has been won the leaders of said revolution don&#039;t tend to want to let go and if you look at the red-revolutions that become a rather fuckin annoying habit of theirs. &quot;Freedom for the worker! Freedom for the worker! Hmmmmm now we have freedom we better stick the worker in the Gulag to make sure he doesn&#039;t want too much freedom&quot; THAT shit, every, single, time. So as this is the case then we may as well have a trickle down system where if you work had enough and have a bit of ambition and grit you can get somewhere fairly decent. Also what communism also does is deny an inescapable truth - we AREN&#039;T all equal and NEVER will be. If we were why are some smarter than others? Some more athletic than others? Some more creative than others? It&#039;s because society needs different people to fill all the different gaps and communism robs those of a chance to exorcise their talents and creativity and independent thought. <br /><br />So given all of the above....I&#039;d definitely rather be in a world where everybody takes their cut and we all get paid. <br /><br />My two cents.

				I wanted to take the time to dissect this post because I believe all the rationale is supported by inaccurate assumptions. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28451.msg314639#msg314639">Quote from: Brave New World on June 29, 2012, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Capitalism is dead. One&#039;s opinion does not matter. <br />Capitalism is dead because it is unsustainable. <br />The Earth cannot replenish its resources at the rate at which humans pillage it for profit.<br />It is only a matter of time.<br />Either the Human race evolves past capitalism or perishes.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Capitalism does nothing of the sort. It is merely a means by which one human&nbsp; acquires what he or she wants from persons competing to provide a better service for a better value than the others doing the same thing. Without capitalism one cannot have freedom.&nbsp; Capitalism is merely the existence of economic liberty. The &quot;down side&quot; of this is that some folks are better at earning an income and thriving in an environment where one is capable of failure. Because of this capitalism requires that some will succeed, and some must fail, while the majority, like a bell curve (I realize the distribution is not exactly a bell) do well enough to be mostly content and meet the majority if not all of their needs. <br /><br />To evolve past capitalism is to lose the current economic freedom that we have. The old saying &#039;the rich get richer while the poor get poorer&#039; is easily explained by two facts; the rich keep doing what it was that made them rich, and the poor keep doing what it was that made/keep them poor, and half the people are below average.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28451.msg314639#msg314639">Quote from: Brave New World on June 29, 2012, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At the moment we have the resources and capabilities to shelter, food and clothe the entire population 3x&#039;s over.<br />We have the technology to reduce our pollution to near zero. <br />However this will never happen. WHY?<br />Because technological advancements are hindered and completely controlled by profit motive.<br />Capitalism is in fact restraining advancements in technology as those in power will do whatever necessary to ensure a new product does not enter the market that will undercut their earnings.<br /><br />Capitalism is also preventing humans from living in balance with Earth.<br />The damage to the Earth is not part of the equation in Capitalism, only money, money, money.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What you call the &#039;profit motive&#039; is indeed a real thing. However, I do not share your negative connotation with it. Stating that society at large is able to provide all of it&#039;s citizens with the necessities is a true statement, but one which I consider almost evil. To make the provision of food, clothing, shelter, and (dare I say) health care a &#039;basic human right&#039; is one of those things which sounds good, but is evil. Why do I say evil? Well, consider this. If one has a right to something (in the form of a service or product) then by definition another has duty to provide it. One cannot provide a service or product without sacrificing their time. By saying someone has a right to a service or product means that someone is forced to provide it. Either by one person bearing the burden, or by society collectively stepping in to compensate the providing party with compensation.<br /><br />Therein lies the problem. The economic freedoms of others are compromised. <br /><br />To your other point. The Earth&#039;s resources are indeed finite. Capitalism may well cause the depletion of these resources sooner, but they will, no matter what we do, be depleted at some point. What capitalism provides is a way out. Asteroids, for instance, are full of gold, silver and diamonds. Eventually that profit motive will get us there. There may not be fossil fuels on these extraterrestrial bodies, but there is value there. We will never get there with gas. Capitalism provides the drive for humanity to do more.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />There are some instances, I&#039;m sure, of new technologies being suppressed by the established industries, but they cannot, and never have, suppressed them forever. What has to happen, though, is the technology has to increase to a point where it can be made profitable. One that comes to mind is new power sources for automobiles. You hear a lot about hydrogen fuel cells. They can make a working prototype, but the infrastructure is not in place,&nbsp; nor is the technology cheap and reliable enough to implement full scale at the moment.<br /><br />But one day it will be. And when that day comes, some rich people will jump start the industry. It will work when it can work.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=28451.msg314639#msg314639">Quote from: Brave New World on June 29, 2012, 01:22 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Humans no longer have a symbiotic relationship with Mother Earth.<br />Every other living organism on this planet does.

Humans are, and have been for a long time, the very top of the food chain. What this means is that our population is under no external threats. Most other species are controlled by predators. When the deer population gets too high, they all starve as well. As deer are currently in many parts of the country. What does that mean? Their population is too high and they are out eating the things on which they survive.

Have you never heard of the Gilded Age between 1865-1929? I encourage you to read up on it. We&#039;ve been here before. During that time the American upper class was experiencing unprecedented wealth due to runaway laissez-faire capitalism. Then, as now, the top 1% was hoarding and consolidating its grip on wealth and power and forming a New Aristocracy. Doomsayers just like you were trumpeting the death of capitalism. You would have made a fine communist mouthpiece during those times. It was true that capitalism was cannibalizing itself.<br /><br />So what happened? Precisely what you mockingly claim can&#039;t happen. Politics reigned in capitalism. First Teddy came along and trust busted the monopolies that proved to be stagnating economic growth with a lack of competition. Then it all changed in 1929 with FDR. FDR and others neutered the Wealth Aristocracy in America, in large effect. Thereby saving Capitalism. If you don&#039;t believe me, believe (your hero?) Stalin. He remarked that FDR had given Capitalism another thirty years of life. <br /><br />You don&#039;t seem to comprehend that representative democracy mixed with capitalism is not just imperfect, but represents a constant work in progress. There are going to be times when the pendulum swings one way with powerful moneyed interests overreaching that requires the natural forces of perpetual progress to force it back the other way whether that be a sharp and courageous leader or the mass awareness of a problem that leads to an organic protest movement to reign in the excesses of special interests. If you study political science you&#039;ll learn our government was designed to be this constant yo-yo tug of war for power between the masses and powerful interests, and is never a finished product devoid of hope like you&#039;re envisioning. In light of the successes of the past, I have much more confidence in democratic form of governance than you do. Outside your propensity to trash capitalism as hopeless and unworkable I have yet to hear you propose a viable economic system to capitalism. <br /><br />

				Yes. In order to truly experience the absolute best our consciousness and species can offer, we must also experience the absolute worst. There is not one without the other and one cannot overpower the other. They must exist in duality meaning both must be occurring simultaneously. What we think of as good will never win over evil, and evil will never win over good, they must both exist equally - for one is not superior to the other because one cannot exist without the other. This simple rule of &quot;everything has an equal opposite&quot; is what creates the infinitely gradient richness we all can choose to see. For example, there is no limit to how great or how destructive life can be, meaning anything is possible and everything that is possible will eventually happen - either here or in another universe/dimension. We created incredibly complex machine language with this same principle: 1&#039;s and 0&#039;s or positive and negative electrical charges. That turned out to be something pretty special, no?<br /><br />The Universe, and ultimately the multiverse and beyond, is actually incredibly easy and intuitive to understand because we are made of it and it exists within us. Our bodies are essentially star dust and our consciousness is a force just like gravity in that it&#039;s all relative ;) We existed even before the &#039;Big Bang&#039; because our consciousness is eternal and if it doesn&#039;t exist here, it will exist elsewhere. What we see and experience could not be possible without a universe and the universe could not be possible without us - or any observer - observing it. In other words, the universe wouldn&#039;t exist without us and we wouldn&#039;t exist without the universe. By &#039;us&#039; and &#039;we&#039;, I&#039;m including all life anywhere. Hope this answers your question.

Does anyone REALLY believe that anything will change even if that happened? Nah would it fuck. The government that did it wouldn&#039;t let us all become potential millionaires overnight for shit, that&#039;s just fucking naive. What they would do instead is issue licenses like they do any other illegal drug and let people like Pfizer and all the rest of them monopolise the shit out of it and then we would be pissed off that they were making junkies and it being corrupt as fuck and taking all the cheddar.

Hell, I see several ways I would benefit myself in such a society, right off the bat. In my honest opinion looking at everything and determining how each individual party will benefit is the best practical philosophical advice one can give. This is why people will (and do) act in any given scenario.<br /><br />Having said that that I&#039;m an anarchist at heart. If it was realistic I would love to see a world where everyone can do what they want when they want, and we all as a society support this. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll see it though.

				Here&#039;s a question for you.<br /><br />If you were told, we can solve all world hunger, poverty, and house/feed/shelter everyone, but the west has to give up phones/internet/movies/music/cars/commercialised food industry/transport etc and grow your own food.. Would you?<br /><br />My personal answer, no. You can call that selfish, and yes, it is. <br /><br />But I think deep down, most people would be apprehensive about giving all of that up. I mean, who actually cares about world poverty? I mean if you ask me, I&#039;ll say &quot;well of course its bad&quot;.. And if you actually sent me over to Africa or somewhere, I&#039;m sure it&#039;d hit me harder. But on a day to day basis, who ever thinks about it? Some people will, but most of us? We. just. don&#039;t. give. a. fuck. Admit it. Obviously we don&#039;t give a fuck, because if we all gave a fuck, we would have done something about it, wouldn&#039;t we?<br /><br />It&#039;s just another example of people and their lofty morals that they spout off as beliefs but don&#039;t really believe. <br /><br />For example I find that most people that talk about the amount of civilian deaths in Iraq, do so to win points when arguing against the right wing, and not out of any sort of genuine empathy for the victims.<br /><br />People are scared to say &quot;I just don&#039;t care about all these people dying. It doesn&#039;t impact me in any meaningful way as it isn&#039;t near me.&quot; And the thing they&#039;re scared of, is the condemnation of OTHER people who also don&#039;t really give a shit, but just have so much unerring self belief that they can&#039;t tell the difference between the point they&#039;re making to win an argument and a genuine caring for the victims of war. <br /><br />Even the people who are most forceful in their beliefs. Most of the time, they&#039;re doing that for ego reasons. It&#039;s not because they REALLY REALLY care about this stuff. They just really want to see themselves as superior to you so use an example like 100,000 dead Iraqis. And those that really honestly do care.. they&#039;re in the minority. <br /><br /><br />Yet I know for a fact it is the mindset of most people that we don&#039;t really give that much of a fuck, its blatantly obvious. It&#039;s reflected in the news. 100,000 dead civilians is on for about 20 minutes, whereas 1 white middle class blonde girl kidnapped in the Algarve is front-page news for over a year. And why is that? It&#039;s because we care about our own entertainment, and stories, and we don&#039;t give a fuck about how many dead people there are. Sorry if you&#039;re offended, I didn&#039;t create humanity. Be mad at nature, you know the instincts that would make a lion rip your throat out. <br /><br />I don&#039;t make the rules, I just play the game. I care about myself, my friends, and my family, and doing things I enjoy. On a global scale, it is a very selfish mindset to have, but I don&#039;t give a shit, and I don&#039;t mind saying so. And I&#039;m not even saying that not caring about people is a good way to live. <br /><br />I&#039;m just saying, let&#039;s be honest about our motivations here. Humanity is a shit species. We all say we care about each other but really we&#039;re looking out for number 1. If you want to try and further a cause for helping people, do so because you really care, and not because you want to look good or so you can look in the mirror and tell yourself you&#039;re a humanitarian. <br />

The religious have stolen the argument by saying &quot;good and bad must come from God. Anything that doesn&#039;t come from God isn&#039;t really good or bad&quot;. <br /><br />Therefore we say, in reply, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; don&#039;t exist. <br /><br />And in the religious sense, they don&#039;t. Because the religious idea of morality, doesn&#039;t make any sense at all. <br /><br />But they do exist, as very real, abstract ideas. So in that sense, we can say that good and bad exist. You know, the actual ideas of good and bad. Not this religious idea of a definitive, 100%, good or bad, that is a totally meaningless thing to say anyway, because no idea exists in that sense. &quot;Chairs&quot; don&#039;t exist. Just bits of wood and plastic. <br /><br />It&#039;s the same with good and bad.

If what you say is accurate, there a lot of people out there that shouldn&#039;t bother with psychedelics. In my experience these are only going to exacerbate any disillusions with society, especially considering your points. And that isn&#039;t something that&#039;s easy to deal with.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re wrong, just pointing out something that needs to be considered. Why let people awaken to the &#039;truth&#039; only to send them into a depressive cycle that doesn&#039;t help anyone? That&#039;s like taking someone out of the matrix, only for that person to off themselves the next day.<br /><br />2. I&#039;m one of those people that is only held back by potential consequences of my actions. Hence my being here. The consequences are I get caught and go to jail/rehab for my drug use, which I&#039;m fine with, as I&#039;ve made peace with these options. Not only that, bust as a pessimist/nihilist I have already prepared to make the best of the worst situation.<br /><br />One thing I will say is this. Although it is consequences that hold me back most, the consequences of losing friendships/relationships/other partnerships are included in this. I&#039;m not a heartless prick who only looks after himself, but if something doesn&#039;t benefit me I&#039;m not likely to entertain it as an idea.<br /><br />Look at anyone who says they did something for someone else, and tell me honestly you can&#039;t find another motive. Sex, career advancement, monetary gain, it doesn&#039;t matter really, everyone will do anything for themselves.

				You can&#039;t equate &quot;having a conscience and submitting to it&quot; as a fear of consequences. <br /><br />It&#039;s one thing to say I fear consequences in the sense that I fear getting caught or in trouble. But saying that the hurt you may cause your family/friends, the guilt you may feel.. to say that these are consequences, is to extend the meaning of the word consequence in this context well beyond what it refers to.<br /><br />Sure, even if you are guilty and change your behaviour, it is still giving in to your own guilt. And in that sense, you are doing something for yourself. <br /><br />But that&#039;s a bit of a blanket statement to say that that action is therefore selfish isn&#039;t it? Selfishness is a lot more specific than that, namely doing something with no regard for anyone else. Having guilt doesn&#039;t fall into that category, because whilst its a feeling that you yourself feel and are thus affected by, is still subject and dependent upon the input of others. I don&#039;t think we can blanket all actions as selfish or individualistic just because they are performed by an individual. I think that cheapens the idea. <br /><br />And I didn&#039;t really understand your point on psychedelics. The world may be fucked up, but just because you take psychedelics doesn&#039;t mean you have to spiral into depression. You can still live in a fucked up world and enjoy yourself. You think those guys in North Korea aren&#039;t getting their dicks sucked?

Laws do not stop murderers from murdering. Just like laws do not stop drug users from using drugs. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all felt like killing someone, but would we actually do it if murdering were legal? I think not for the most part. That doesn&#039;t mean we should allow it, and is a reason a government is needed for now, however small and non-intrusive it must be. There is still a small role for government to play - at least at this stage in our evolution until we can attain true enlightenment and then will have no need for it. I also think the government should be 100% voluntary. I, for one, would volunteer and I know I can&#039;t be the only one.&nbsp; Thankfully, life has sort of a built-in code of ethics that tells us going around killing your kind would not be good for the continuation of your species. We must evolve to the point where we don&#039;t need leaders and governments to assure us of our rights. It&#039;s only a choice.

I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all felt like killing someone, but would we actually do it if murdering were legal? I think not for the most part. That doesn&#039;t mean we should allow it, and is a reason a government is needed for now, however small and non-intrusive it must be. There is still a small role for government to play - at least at this stage in our evolution until we can attain true enlightenment and then will have no need for it. I also think the government should be 100% voluntary. I, for one, would volunteer and I know I can&#039;t be the only one.&nbsp; Thankfully, life has sort of a built-in code of ethics that tells us going around killing your kind would not be good for the continuation of your species. We must evolve to the point where we don&#039;t need leaders and governments to assure us of our rights. It&#039;s only a choice.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think I agree with you here at a fundamental level at least.

I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re worldview is wrong or anything, but it&#039;s simply a choice. Meaning that it&#039;s personal. I also choose to view the world pessimistically at least for now.<br />Humans have the capability to both ruin and create or &#039;save&#039; Earth - and how arrogant of us to think we are a threat to Earth right now. Sure, we can extinguish all life on this planet with our nuclear weapons, but we don&#039;t have the capability to destroy a planet just yet. The earth will still be here long after we choose to either extinguish ourselves as a species or continue to evolve.<br />One can be happy without having to forgive. Needing forgiveness implies the universe made a mistake, and the universe doesn&#039;t make mistakes. The very fabric of the universe is consciousness. And funny thing about consciousness is that it is only experienced subjectively. which is why it is impossible to fully understand the universe while in physicality. The only way to know something, is to be it. You are you in physical form, and in death when your mind is released and expands to the ends of time - then you are the universe or maybe what is beyond. That is until we can illuminate the other 90% of the brain we don&#039;t use while in physical form. Fortunately, drugs (mainly psychedelics) and of course dreaming can help us do that. My drug of choice is weed btw, I tend not to mess with the harder stuff but I&#039;ll have a beer occasionally.

				@ Anarcho<br /><br />On the point about stopping all the cool stuff in the west to solve world poverty.. If you read, I didn&#039;t actually say it would, or could.

				The U.S. alone could clothe, feed, shelter, and educate the entire world population - not one being excluded - if we spent all the money we use bombing other countries for this purpose. It would pay for itself many times over and we as a species could explore outer space together. I believe a great philosopher by the name of Bill Hicks once said this.

I&#039;m not referring to innovation or ingenuity in designing a superior product with a competitive advantage that benefits consumers when it&#039;s brought to market. That&#039;s the fairytale you&#039;ve been brought up to believe. Not saying there&#039;s still not some truth to that, especially as a first gen pioneer bringing an innovative product to brand new markets. But there are plenty of superior products that should enjoy a competitive advantage that fail all the time because of other darker market forces at work, which I believe BNW made some reference to up-thread. <br /><br />I&#039;ll give you a fairly sanitized example. In the early nineties, a host of innovation in office application software run on the MS platform began coming up. WordPerfect for windows was such a product with a superior feature set that made it the word processor of choice at the time. But Microsoft&#039;s extreme wealth from owning 80+% of the desktop market and creator of the platform these apps ran on placed it in a dominant position when they decided to &quot;compete&quot; in the office app sector. After introducing their office apps like msword they simply gave it away for free until it drove all competitors into bankruptcy. They could afford it, it was no skin off their back since their bread and butter was the OS market. And they got away with it with a slap on the wrist, a mere fine. Gates had catapulted to the pole position of world&#039;s wealthiest and was determined to stay there. So they repeated this market strategy with some new wrinkles when they decided to go after Netscape and own the browser market. Not only did they make their Internet Explorer free, but they used the fact it ran on their OS to unfair advantage by making it run at higher priority, and therefore faster, than anything an independent software developer like Netscape would have been capable of doing. Not because NS developers lacked the innovation and ingenuity to do so, they had plenty of both and NS was a superior browser feature wise at the time, but because they didn&#039;t have access to Microsoft&#039;s proprietary and protected source code and couldn&#039;t optimize it to prioritize Netscape legally even if they did. And back during the days of dial-ups and limited e-commerce, speed was all that really mattered.<br /><br />So as you all know, Netscape was run into the ground. But this event turned some heads since Netscape was far bigger than WordPerfect and was also a Wall Street darling. And we should all know by now why Wall Street titans are referred to as Masters of the Universe and that it can be precarious walking into the cross-hairs of the MoU without some political cover. An epic, multi-state and multi-country antitrust lawsuit ensued against MS. Gates was somewhat late in getting into the game of political lobbying, one of the common playgrounds of oligarchs, but once he committed to the game in late &#039;98 he tackled it with the same single minded tenacity as he had in becoming the dominant force in the OS market. And why wouldn&#039;t he? Because of his ruthless, value destroying anti-competitive practices in his dogged pursuit of markets he felt entitled to own, his baby was now under threat of being smashed up into 3 separate companies. In &#039;99 when judge Penfield Jackson overseeing the case announced that MS was going to pay, he was pretty much telegraphing the certainty of the breakup, that MS had repeatedly ignored gov warnings about wielding their near monopoly unfairly, and this was the last straw. Working in the industry at the heart of silicon valley, I remember after that announcement no one in their right mind thought MS would survive.<br /><br />Yet a few weeks before the ruling was expected to come down Gates was furiously lobbying congress meeting personally and donating generously to members of the senate commerce committee, lobbying the White House, and announced that his foundation was donating 1 billion to organizations that provided scholarships to black Americans. Then two weeks following the ruling, the gov announced it would be going into arbitration with MS to figure out how to proceed, if at all. It was announced that judge Jackson had chosen his colleague Judge Richard Posner, a libertarian and freshwater trained legal scholar, to hear the arbitration and decide the case, shocking MS&#039;s enemies. <br /><br />The rest, as we know, is history.<br /><br />Now there are cases of the wealthiest using black practices far more unsavory and destructive than what Gates did in this fairly sanitary example. But it happens often enough, and far more deviant things happen behind the scenes than the public is even aware, that it should be considered the rule and not the exception. And think about it. Someone worth in the tens of billions doesn&#039;t play by the same rules that you or I since they don&#039;t have to. They have enough to buy anyone, compromise any institution, assemble their own private black-op militias to do whatever dirty work they want including sabotage and industrial espionage of up and coming competitors while maintaining enough insularity to create plausible deniability that they&#039;ll never get anything more than a slap on the wrist even if caught. And if you think I&#039;m exaggerating, one of the wealthiest and most prolific had his multinational corps caught doing precisely these things in recent years. As a thought experiment, I&#039;ll let you figure out exactly who that is. <br /><br />I personally have a very low tolerance for conspiracy theorists and without personal, firsthand knowledge of the kind of shenanigans that go on, might be more inclined to believe the fairytale since it&#039;s nice, safe, and comfortable to think the wealthiest in the world should be idealized for &quot;pulling humanity forward&quot;. It&#039;s never so simple. When I look at the wealthiest 100 only Warren Buffet stands out as someone who *might* not have gotten his hands dirty (although it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if he had) since his talent is in investment rather than corporation building and market share pwning. He&#039;s also one of the good guys who&#039;s used his position to rail against the wealthy for stealing from the middle class while bringing awareness of the tactics used by the .01% to his great personal detriment. After a sustained propaganda campaign by his wealthy enemies which ended up with middle class tools he was sticking up for turning on him, calling him a socialist (I know, Buffet a socialist? rotfl) and he became the target of a politically motivated IRS investigation into 1 billion of his finances he backed off, but is still putting his efforts behind trying to get the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes.<br /><br />And those are just the individuals on the Forbes list. There are plenty that are in that sphere that hide their wealth in corporations because they know the limelight places unwanted oversight on their underhanded strategies and tactics.<br /><br />So when I said I believe you suffer from a certain mainstream naivete, you really shouldn&#039;t take it so personally that you turn around and try and accuse me of the same ... it&#039;s just that, well,&nbsp; you do.

In &#039;99 when judge Penfield Jackson overseeing the case announced that MS was going to pay, he was pretty much telegraphing the certainty of the breakup, that MS had repeatedly ignored gov warnings about wielding their near monopoly unfairly, and this was the last straw. Working in the industry at the heart of silicon valley, I remember after that announcement no one in their right mind thought MS would survive.<br /><br />Yet a few weeks before the ruling was expected to come down Gates was furiously lobbying congress meeting personally and donating generously to members of the senate commerce committee, lobbying the White House, and announced that his foundation was donating 1 billion to organizations that provided scholarships to black Americans. Then two weeks following the ruling, the gov announced it would be going into arbitration with MS to figure out how to proceed, if at all. It was announced that judge Jackson had chosen his colleague Judge Richard Posner, a libertarian and freshwater trained legal scholar, to hear the arbitration and decide the case, shocking MS&#039;s enemies. <br /><br />The rest, as we know, is history.<br /><br />Now there are cases of the wealthiest using black practices far more unsavory and destructive than what Gates did in this fairly sanitary example. But it happens often enough, and far more deviant things happen behind the scenes than the public is even aware, that it should be considered the rule and not the exception. And think about it. Someone worth in the tens of billions doesn&#039;t play by the same rules that you or I since they don&#039;t have to. They have enough to buy anyone, compromise any institution, assemble their own private black-op militias to do whatever dirty work they want including sabotage and industrial espionage of up and coming competitors while maintaining enough insularity to create plausible deniability that they&#039;ll never get anything more than a slap on the wrist even if caught. And if you think I&#039;m exaggerating, one of the wealthiest and most prolific had his multinational corps caught doing precisely these things in recent years. As a thought experiment, I&#039;ll let you figure out exactly who that is. <br /><br />I personally have a very low tolerance for conspiracy theorists and without personal, firsthand knowledge of the kind of shenanigans that go on, might be more inclined to believe the fairytale since it&#039;s nice, safe, and comfortable to think the wealthiest in the world should be idealized for &quot;pulling humanity forward&quot;. It&#039;s never so simple. When I look at the wealthiest 100 only Warren Buffet stands out as someone who *might* not have gotten his hands dirty (although it wouldn&#039;t surprise me if he had) since his talent is in investment rather than corporation building and market share pwning. He&#039;s also one of the good guys who&#039;s used his position to rail against the wealthy for stealing from the middle class while bringing awareness of the tactics used by the .01% to his great personal detriment. After a sustained propaganda campaign by his wealthy enemies which ended up with middle class tools he was sticking up for turning on him, calling him a socialist (I know, Buffet a socialist? rotfl) and he became the target of a politically motivated IRS investigation into 1 billion of his finances he backed off, but is still putting his efforts behind trying to get the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes.<br /><br />And those are just the individuals on the Forbes list. There are plenty that are in that sphere that hide their wealth in corporations because they know the limelight places unwanted oversight on their underhanded strategies and tactics.<br /><br />So when I said I believe you suffer from a certain mainstream naivete, you really shouldn&#039;t take it so personally that you turn around and try and accuse me of the same ... it&#039;s just that, well,&nbsp; you do.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No offense to you, but your example is, again, full of fallacies.<br /><br />First of all, why should MS have been prevented from GIVING AWAY something?&nbsp; Hell, why should they have been prevented from doing whatever they hell they wanted with the resources from the profits of windows? (There are some fucked up things with MS but they all have to do with artificial violent constructs like copyright and IP, and they don&#039;t need to be touched on here because that is TRILLIONS of dollars of misallocated resources around the world, and it&#039;s not due to some evil &quot;oligarchs&quot;.)<br /><br />The &quot;value destroying&quot; argument you made was actually microsoft employing its resources to create a web-browser (that, at the time, was better than netscape) and give it away to its customers.&nbsp; It didn&#039;t destroy value, it freed up the several billion dollars per year that customers were originally deploying towards netscape&#039;s browser.&nbsp; That&#039;s not &quot;ruthless&quot;, it&#039;s just smart.&nbsp; And the customers win.<br /><br />Now, MS has since switched over to charging for its Office pack, but that has already been spanked by the free market again, as Open Office is completely free.<br /><br />What you are saying right now is that we should be shutting down Google for creating the android OS and charging ZERO licensing fees to use it.&nbsp; You are saying that it is value-destroying that people in Africa can purchase a basic chinese spartphone for $89.00 running the Android OS, that would cost them about $200 to run Windows for phone, and would be impossible to get from a company like Apple (also running proprietary and soon to have some major failures on that front).<br /><br />What you are railing against is progress.&nbsp; It&#039;s not &quot;ruthless&quot;, just because it does something better or cheaper than someone else.&nbsp; If the customers win, and no violence is employed, why the hell should we want to try to destroy the institution enriching society by giving it more, for less?<br /><br />Have you ever heard of an actual consumer filing an anti-trust lawsuit?&nbsp; Accusing a company of being &quot;monopolistic&quot;?&nbsp; US Steel got broken up because they were putting their competitors out of business with their superior production methods and low prices.&nbsp; The price of steel rose by over 20% because of this.&nbsp; The customers got hurt, not the businesses that should have failed.<br /><br />By what merit or measurement do you choose, based on your strange and (from my view, anyway) arbitrary definition of someone who is innovating and someone who is &quot;ruthless&quot; (by whatever it is that your definition of that word is)?

Just don&#039;t go around claiming that customers win because after the initial phase, they don&#039;t. They lose. I encourage you to learn a bit in the field of economics. The problem with monopolies is really elementary stuff. I already mentioned that IE was a superior browser because it was faster and NS was unable to compete in this area. And what happened after NS was driven to bankruptcy? There were many years of no new innovation in browser tech. MS stopped developing IE because they had &quot;won&quot;. Until opensource software like Firefox, Opera, and Chrome began to drive MS into developing again. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What you are saying right now is that we should be shutting down Google for creating the android OS and charging ZERO licensing fees to use it.&nbsp; You are saying that it is value-destroying that people in Africa can purchase a basic chinese spartphone for $89.00 running the Android OS, that would cost them about $200 to run Windows for phone, and would be impossible to get from a company like Apple (also running proprietary and soon to have some major failures on that front).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Once again, it&#039;s clear you&#039;re running up to the limitations of your knowledge. You&#039;re comparing apples and oranges. First of all, the Android distro was not &quot;created&quot; by Google like MS created their desktop applications or created IE. Android is a linux based distro for mobile devices completely developed and maintained by the opensource community committed to developing and maintaining free software. Linux is an OS that&#039;s been freely licensed and developed by the opensource community since the first kernel was written in &#039;92 by Linus Torvald dude. Google purchased Android in &#039;05 after the distro had already been created and they lead a consortium that develops free software for mobile based devices specific to Android, but are prevented by the strict rules of the GNU licensing agreement developed by Linus from anyone profiting off the sale of freely developed software on an OS he created. So Android must be free. <br /><br />The opensource community is a great benefit to consumers by once again providing competition to MS to make better products. I already mentioned how it drove them to start developing their browser again. That&#039;s just one example of many, but it should be clear that opensource software is of great benefit by offering consumers more choices. Not destroying competition and limiting them. In light of this, the crux of your argument of why Google should be shut down is absurd. You&#039;re simply not understanding that competition is beneficial to everyone (good) while monopolies only benefit the few (bad). Maybe this is all too technical for you to understand, or maybe terms like opensource and distinction between &quot;distro&quot; and &quot;OS&quot; are over your head. If so, I encourage you to learn about them to get a better grip of what you&#039;re arguing.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What you are railing against is progress.&nbsp; It&#039;s not &quot;ruthless&quot;, just because it does something better or cheaper than someone else.&nbsp; If the customers win, and no violence is employed, why the hell should we want to try to destroy the institution enriching society by giving it more, for less?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Sorry dude, monopolization of a commercial sector is not progress. It stifles progress. You seem mentally incapable of recognizing that the only reason MS was able to give away their desktop apps software was not because their desktop apps were markedly better and cheaper than the competition because they weren&#039;t, but because they owned an entirely different market, not the desktop application market, but the desktop OS market, that gave them the resources to give away their desktop apps until competitors in the desktop apps market went out of business. Just like your inability to acknowledge that rewriting the MS desktop OS source code which they owned to give IE a higher priority that competitors like NS did not have access to and were unable to do is using their monopolistic power in an entirely different market to unfair advantage. It can&#039;t be anymore clear than that and if you don&#039;t see it, I&#039;m probably not going to be able to point it out to you. Just that there&#039;s not a lot of people that would agree with you.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try one last tact though it&#039;s an imperfect analogy. I see you sell weed on SR. Let&#039;s say SR was the only viable market to sell drugs and a competitor came along who owned the markets in all the other drugs sold on SR. Now they they wanted to own the weed market and offered products competitive to yours and all other vendors but made their products free. After a while, you and other growers would no longer be able to stay in business since the cost of keeping your grow ops can&#039;t be supported when you can&#039;t sell your product. They were able to do this not because their weed was of such superior quality that no one wanted to buy yours, but because they owned other markets and could afford to make their weed free as a market strategy to capture the SR weed market too. But of course, you&#039;d think this was perfectly fair and wouldn&#039;t consider it ruthless right? After all, this would have great initial benefits for consumers since they get their shit free ... but only up to a point. There would be no need to improve the strains or offer more variety to the consumer, nothing to drive innovation. After you declared bankruptcy they would first buy up all your assets in the fire sale of bankruptcy court, and with you and the rest were dead and gone, they would likely introduce a price that would offset some losses but still make operating costs all but unbearably impossible for new vendors that might consider entering the market. But since they owned all the other drug markets combined, they could more than afford it just to own the market since it the cost was only a tiny fraction of their total revenue. This is very much like what MS did to own the office app market.<br /><br />Now, imagine that in place of the conglomerate that owned all the other SR drug markets, this was actually the creator of the SR market itself, DPR, who had the vast funds that he made from SR commissions as well as all the other markets at his disposal and wanted to own the SR weed market. So he starts producing weed competitive to yours and all other vendors and not only offers them for free, but makes sure that when a buyer goes to buy weed his listings show up first while your products that actually cost money show up last. Of course, you don&#039;t understand why anyone would see this as ruthless right? It&#039;s perfectly fair that you have to shut down shop because after all, he owns the platform, he can dictate whatever he wants to do with it. This is like what MS did to own the browser market.<br /><br />The reason I say it&#039;s an imperfect analogy is that it actually costs money to keep running a weed grow-op and giving away weed for free whereas after MS &quot;won&quot; the browser war it cost them nothing for a number of years as they did nothing to continue to develop and improve it.<br /><br />One last note is on your example of bringing up US Steel. FYI, US Steel wasn&#039;t a total monopoly. They had 70% of the industry before their breakup. But their competitors were forced be much more innovative and efficient to stay competitive at all. You note that US Steel was able to offer the product cheaper. I wouldn&#039;t say their production methods were better, just that they cost less. But of course they did. I encourage you to learn what the term &quot;economies of scale&quot; means. That&#039;s what happens when you own 70% of the market and manufacturing process. And of course prices went up initially after their breakup. That&#039;s what always happens right after the breakup of a monopoly because you no longer have one company taking advantage of economies of scale. It takes a while for competition and innovation to bring prices down again but it&#039;s still better long term.<br /><br />So I mentioned already that I think you suffer from a certain mainstream naivete. But it&#039;s also become clear you have a fundamentally poor grasp of economics and how markets work and I strongly encourage you to take a basic economics class. Since you&#039;re a SR weed vendor, I really think you&#039;d have a lot to gain and find it a super educational experience. If you&#039;re familiar with that show The Wire while still in syndication you&#039;ll remember that&#039;s what Stringer Bell did and he was able to apply the knowledge to great affect. :)

				Freedom is all in the mind because it&#039;s quite clear we aren&#039;t and can never be socially or literally free. It&#039;s impossible because if you try to be the consequences are you either get locked up or shot or something shitty. We can be free in what we think though, nobody can take that away from you even if they try. You can always disagree with someone and that&#039;s where your sanctuary should be because what you think is what makes you you.

One variation of social freedom could include that animals should not be treated that way as they can&#039;t confirm that they desire it. It depends on who/what society feels should have freedom.<br /><br />If you are not allowed to engage in relations with your dog, you can argue that&#039;s a limitation on freedom. If your dog is subject to your bestial desires then it can be seen as a limitation on your dog&#039;s freedom to spend its life engaging in more normal acts with members of its own species.<br /><br />&quot;True freedom&quot; is far from an absolutely defined idea.

If you don&#039;t understand the concept of fairness by now, it&#039;s obviously too nuanced of a concept for you, and I&#039;m certainly not going to be able to explain it to you.

Fuck lust, too. Fuck you all, from the lowlife dirtbags that think dropping trou and waving the little soldier in a sloppy arc is a pick-up line to the sniveling of the desperate &#039;nice guys&#039; who never get the girl due to a total lack of testosterone grown stones. Fuck you all, from the crazy, under dressed sluts that judge a persons character by the price of their shirt, right down to the fat, flabby chicks that think personality is enough.<br /><br />Fuck you drivers, for thinking that a yellow light is a sign that says &#039;step on the gas&#039;. Fuck you wheelmen and women that think it&#039;s okay to sit in a left hand turn in the middle of morning traffic, even though there is a protected left in the intersections before and after where you need to make your turn.

And fuck you also for not getting the fuck out of your designated handicapped seat when a pregnant or elderly person gets on the fucking bus.<br /><br />Fuck taxes. Fuck welfare. Fuck the whole selfish, over politicized and party driven government system. I&#039;m sick and fucking tired of policies and new laws with seven hundred bylaws that nobody but you and your cabinet reads. Fuck you councilors and your stupid &#039;district improvement&#039; plans. Fuck you unions, for asking for so much and giving nothing more that what you already give. Fuck the whole process that allows people who are supposed to be working for us work for interests that only benefit the next campaign. Fuck your short-sightedness, your rush to the bandwagons, and your incessant arguing over fuck all. Fuck the parties, fuck the conventions, and fuck your campaigns. Do some real fucking work for a change.<br /><br />Fuck you bottles of water. You&#039;re water. You&#039;re not worth two fucking dollars.<br />Fuck you trendsetters, fuck you fashionistas.

				There is a universal morality.&nbsp; It is called the Natural Law.&nbsp; It is a moral existence that all human beings can embrace and exercise to the fullest without infringing on any other human being&#039;s ability to do the same.<br /><br />I&#039;m not talking about &quot;drugs are bad so we&#039;ll throw you in a fucking cage if you try to buy them&quot; type of &quot;morality&quot;, or &quot;if you go over the speed limit you will be forced at gunpoint (if you follow it down the line enough) to pay an arbitrary amount of your property to the state as penance&quot;.&nbsp; That is not moral.&nbsp; It is in violation of the laws of nature, which pretty clearly dictate the laws of morality.<br /><br />Every culture that has taken human beings from wallowing around in the muck for 14 hours a day attempting to meagerly feed, clothe, and shelter themselves has embraced at least some element of this morality.&nbsp; The more it was embraced and universally recognized, the greater that culture became and the better quality and quantity of lives each human was given the opportunity to live.<br /><br />Now, instead of deflecting, oh deity who decides the definition of &quot;fair&quot;, please do lay out what I requested from your greatness.&nbsp; It should be merely a trifle, seeing as you are obviously able to lay out the ever-changing moral code and guidelines under which we all must function.&nbsp; Mine do not change.&nbsp; They are static.&nbsp; They are based on humanity, and all individual humans, at that.&nbsp; Keep swimming in Jell-O.

To get an idea of what I mean by &#039;fair&#039; why don&#039;t you reread my MS example slowly, maybe try to focus on the analogy I put forth using your weed growing business if the MS example is too complex, and try to point out why I&#039;m wrong within the framework I spelled out for you. I know you will probably find this quite challenging seeing as to how my original message thoroughly baffled you and you lost the plot. But if you want to continue debate, you need to first demonstrate the ability to carry on a debate with a minimal level of competence that you have not shown. Because I&#039;m sure that most individuals with even an average IQ would have understood the point I was trying to make while you did not. Even a libertarian anarchist with some modicum of intelligence would have been willing to challenge &#039;fairness&#039; within the framework I provided instead of asking for another one. So take this as a challenge to flesh out your ideas irrespective of how much time it takes away from the other challenges in your life, and prove that you&#039;re capable of processing ideas put in front of you instead of throwing a temper tantrum about the other demands on your time. Otherwise, there&#039;s really no point for me to continue spoon feeding you unless you show some potential.<br /><br /><br />&quot;... I have developed, over the years, some sense of the difference between real horseshit that you can step in and Ideal Platonic Horseshit that exists, evidently, only in the contemplation of those who worship such abstractions; and I continue to notice that Natural Law bears an uncanny resemblance to ideal Platonic Horseshit.&quot; ~~Robert Anton Wilson, &quot;Natural Law&quot;
