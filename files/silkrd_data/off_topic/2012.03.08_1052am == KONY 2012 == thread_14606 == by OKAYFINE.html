				Yeah so Kony is a dick and blah blah blah but I dont want to talk about that. I just made that title because I wanted to get your attention. Now that I have it, I&#039;m going to get right to the point. Can someone please give me .02 bitcoins? Pretty please with sugar on top. I am always doing horrible BTC math when I buy them plus all this fluctuation crap that is so confusing. I really really just need to buy some LSD. I know begging for money on the internet is basically pointless but I thought I would just give it a try anyway. Its such a small amount and I bet one of you fellow stoners out there believes in Karma or something like that. Plus all this lotto stuff that is going on now, come on pleeeaaasee? I see people begging for money on 4chan all the time but I wont do anything pathetic for it like post a picture of my weiner. The only thing I can do is make a promise (albeit an internet promise) to pay you back double. That is right a 100% return on your investment! Doesn&#039;t that sound great? No? What? Seriously? Fuck you, you suck. No not you, the other guy. Listen I am going on a trip to Hong Kong in a week and a half and I would really like to go on a real TRIP while i&#039;m doing it. I&#039;m sure someone out there in internetland can understand that. I get back april first I will pay you back I swear to Jesus. Anyway I&#039;m running out of things to say, so I&#039;m just gonna leave it at that and see what happens. Seriously just please. What do you have to lose? Besides money. But that stuff is the root of all evil anyway, just help me do drugs. Thank you. The end.

				Yeah, if you want BTC, just be honest and ask for a loan or donation, the thread title is misleading and low.&nbsp; This Kony shit is serious, though he is not the only or worst person to exploit children.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t lend you the BTC based on at least a couple of statements you&#039;ve made in your message, but if you had just asked I would have.&nbsp; We may be a bunch of high fuckers here, but I&#039;d like to think most of us are honest.<br />&nbsp;::)

				Thats fine I dont need your money, I just made 70 cents looking at pictures of penises. I am sorry for the Kony title, I felt bad about it after. But now that I have my acid ordered, we can discuss this&nbsp; Kony business if you like. I of course admit it is a serious topic, but that video specifically is some of the most terribly manipulative and ridiculous pieces of propaganda I have ever seen. The moment it mentioned donating money I Xed out of it. I&#039;m so sick of this crap going on now a days where everyone thinks they are making a difference by watching a youtube video. Human beings are getting bombarded with so much of this &quot;information&quot; on a daily basis that it has we have well approached the point where it simply becomes a masturbatory act of self indulgence. I could go on about this for an hour because the whole thing offends me on so many levels but I wont. By the way I do not endorse mutilation, rape and child abduction. Just guilt tripping people for money.

				first of all let me state i dont support any of this kony 2012 crap ( i support taking down any violators of human rights, not just the flavour of the month ) but it got me thinking why dont we at SR as a community start running bitcoin charity drives in the same way bikies (and most legitimate corporations) do. it could&nbsp; help our cause as a kind of PR exercise showing that us illicit substances connoisseurs are just normal people like everyone else and may even garner some positive publicity amongst the mainsream misleadia.<br />just my 0.02 BTC<br />ayezz
