				Hi, there is a huge demand for sassafras oil so people can make safrole so people can make MDMA, but there is no sassafras available. sassafras oil contains 80-85% safrole, yet camphor oil, which is hugely available on the clearnet, can contain up to 95% safrole (but mostly around 75%) So why do people not extract safrole from camphor oil? is there a reason or has it just not been done?

				also reading that nutmeg oil contains 2% sassafras now it would be impossible to stop trade in nutmeg if anybody has the skills to clean it up could well be worth it.

				Right girls, it&#039;s time for an education. <br /><br />Camphor oil and Nutmeg are not economically viable for large scale production of MDMA because of the yields. Also, selling Saf on SR isn&#039;t really going to happen either because generally people who can get Saf like my good self aren&#039;t going to sell saf when they could use it to make Mandy and make lots of cheddar and further shipping liquids is much too risky to do via the mail unless you have a proper set up to do it. <br /><br />So lets get real about this, not many people are going to sell you saf or sass etc because well, why the fuck would we want you to get the golden egg instead of us and most of you wouldn&#039;t be able to receive it on a commercial scale and selling it in small amounts has no money in it. Most of the time it&#039;s just a pipe dream for the people that whine about this, if you really wanted it and really had the capacity to do something useful with it you&#039;d link it yourself and definitely wouldn&#039;t be doing it through SR. <br /><br />So tired of seeing threads about this subject because it&#039;s just like hearing a child cry because he can&#039;t get an extra biscuit before dinner.

So how about cutting the hate crap and just realise to people like me and Lim and probably a lot of other vendors, we&#039;re here on business terms, not to share our knowledge which we leave to the wannabe activists who so far haven&#039;t done shit and I hope they don&#039;t either because if some of this stuff goes legal, we lose business.

				some people maybe just want to get their hands on some not to start a business or compete w/ folks who can do the synth in bulk, but these folks (of which i may be one of) are interested merely for academic pursuits, to say you&#039;ve done it before, create something they themselvs would like to consume, and for curiosity&#039;s sake, et cetera... esp dissappointing when you have all the glassware acquired and intellectual research done, and other chems, just missing a tiny bit of juice from your golden egg lol :-P IOW, for that kind of endeavor, only small quantities are needed :-\

				First of all when looking at the composition of camphor oil:<br /><br />Chemical composition<br /><br />The main chemical components are a-pinene, camphene, b-pinene, sabinene, phellandrene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, y-terpinene, p-cymene, terpinolene, furfural, camphor, linalool, bornyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, caryophyllene, borneol, piperitone, geraniol, safrole, cinnamaldehyde, methyl cinnamate and eugenol.<br /><br />If one would have, say 10% safrole in their oil, that means there is 90% of the other compounds. <br /><br />But the person is determined to make this MDMA. So he thinks, I could do a distillation under reduced pressure with a Vigreux column. This way I will obtain pure safrole. <br /><br />However, there may be a 10 degrees difference in the boiling points of safrole and eugenol. It is very difficult to separate these two. Not even talking about the other components also present in the mixture. <br /><br />So this is near to impossible to achieve. <br /><br />But, I could also uses the power of steam to carry my lovely safrole to the condensor where it will nicely condensate and leave me with pure lovely safrole. So all the oil is put in the flask and water is added. Once it boils there are two layers in the receiving flask. Our chemist all happy because it smells like safrole, it looks like safrole, so it must be safrole. <br />But in the next reaction, the Wacker oxidation, there is a big mess formed. How on earth is this possible he thinks. Our little chemist forgot that there are a lot of chemicals that are volatile with steam. So instead of oxidizing safrole, he prepared one beautiful polymer because oxygen is a radical initiator and those Pi electrons are more then willing to form a bond with the radical and create a camphor polymer. <br /><br />Of this is what you&#039;re after, this is the way to go!<br /><br />If one wants to make MDMA, ones best goes with the phenylacetone of safrole. <br /><br />Or just buy piperonal and go with the Knoevenagel condensation with nitroethane. <br /><br />There are a lot of ways, but the camphor oil with low safrole content isn&#039;t the way to go.<br /><br />&nbsp;
