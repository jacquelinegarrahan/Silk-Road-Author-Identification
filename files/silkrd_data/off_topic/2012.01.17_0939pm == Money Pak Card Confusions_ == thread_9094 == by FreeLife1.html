				No, you don&#039;t want a re-load card.<br /><br />You just want the $4.95 Green Dot Money Pak card. Can only use it once.

				No application process.&nbsp; When the cashier rings you up just tell them you want x-amount on the card and that is that.&nbsp;

				btc buddy always treated me real good. i always got the lowest prices and fastest service,madamebradley is also good to work with. but BTC Buddy is my go to guy. he was my first transaction and he walked me through from start to finish then he didn&#039;t even charge me his usual fee he cut me a break. hes an all around good guy.<br /><br /><br />SORRY: i said madamebradley when i should have given the props to sugarmama. but i also borrowed BTC from her so she gets props too.
