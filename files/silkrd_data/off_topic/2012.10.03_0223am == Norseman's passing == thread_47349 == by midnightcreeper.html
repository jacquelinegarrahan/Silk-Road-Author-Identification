				With the recent demise of my most cherished and valued mentor, &quot;The Norseman&quot;, I have elected to take a sabbatical. Most knew him as &quot;Captain&quot;. He reached 97 and was agile as a ghost even unto his last day. A living legend, his greatness was unsurpassed even within the world&#039;s of fiction, perhaps with the exception of Jack London, who he claimed to have met. I never heard him lie. Embellish, yes, but always based in truth.&nbsp; ;) In his honor, I now begin my own final great undertaking as was his wish.<br />I like to be bold. Thinking that&#039;s why I&#039;m here. Truthfully, I have local FRIENDS that score me tree that&#039;s as good or better than what I&#039;ve had here...so far. Example: It&#039;s blue and purple and after chopping up three pinners worth, I had a nice tiny piece of blue hash to scrap off my finger and thumb. I know right; but that description does not come anywhere near the real thing. Upped the order to Super Jumbo Size and, of course, one for the Wifey. :P <br />There&#039;s a vibe here, an atmosphere I feel. Can only describe it now as sticky. The ugly&#039;s try to get in. Everywhere exists a state of war. I have a different war to fight now. I&#039;ll explain further by quoting Liz Angerford. &quot;In times of peace, be at war. In times of war, be at peace.&quot; Let us say a retreat. I like to be sticky free as possible. We&#039;re not huge tokers and with this product, one only needs a hit or two to be fine. My little secret gym bag stash should last us at least a year. Numbers crunched= not worth the risks, however small they may be. <br />This computer has seen better days. It&#039;s loud! Think I&#039;ll have some sledgehammer/furnace fun soon. I do promise I will return, strictly as a scutinizing forum contributor only though.Hearing the clamour already. ;D <br />I have not and do NOT mention the Captain to any in my private life. Just the way it had to be. Private relationship. Therefore, I am thankful for this anonymousness and to those of you here that have listened and sympathize, if any. My grief&nbsp; goes undetected.<br />&quot;Never love anything so much that you cannot watch it die.&quot; The Norseman<br /><br />To any with whom I have in transit orders: I will finalize a.s.a.p. No refunds/ reships will be sought IF anything untoward should occur. Slim chance. The vendors I chose are pros. They are the ones who last.&nbsp; :)
