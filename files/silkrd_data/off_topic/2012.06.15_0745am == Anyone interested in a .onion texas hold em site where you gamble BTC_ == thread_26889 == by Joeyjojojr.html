				Ok so this is just an idea, but hopefully it could become something big if it plays out right. So check it out, i was thinking of setting up a BTC poker site. I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be to open a chatroom where people could gather and establish a game. Then lets say 6-10 people were invited to a private chatroom to play in a .5-1 btc blind game. Each player would have to give me there GPG public key. Each players cards would be dealt and on the chat screen you would receive your hand in a gpg format that you would have to decrypt to see your hand. Then the community cards would be dealt for all players to see unencrypted. Bets would be made with BTC. It would take some time to verify bets, but could be fun. OF course im open to any and all suggestions to get this going by any interested partys. Anyone with computer programing skills who is interested should get at me. Thanks.

				There&#039;s tons of automated gaming software you could use to do this securely, just host it on an anonymous server and make sure it all runs through Tor.<br /><br />People would simply make accounts like they do here and send bitcoins to their account which would be turned into poker credits to play with. Very simple and completely automated.<br /><br />Silk Road voucher prizes would be a good attraction.

				This sounds like an awesome idea! I always have a few coins laying around, might aw well gamble them! you know what else would be cool, if we could get some sports betting going. You could bet with other people and avoid the juice! And if you don&#039;t trust the guy to pay, you could both send the funds to a trusted member/mod and they could send the funds to the winner.

				Dude, I came on the &quot;Off topic&quot; section of the forum to ask THE SAME exact question!! haha, long-live the collective conscious! Well, almost the exact same question. I actually was going to ask the SR crowd if they&#039;d be interested in a whole suite of gambling options in addition to hold &#039;em, like slots, black jack, video poker, roulette, etc etc.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />And joey, if you want to work together on this, i&#039;m game (no pun intended). i wouldn&#039;t mind working together with you on this instead of competing with you.

				I would be very interested in the Hold Em site.&nbsp; When I first came on the forums I considered a thread asking if there were any poker players, what made me change my mind was the fact that if people gave usernames and what sites they played, this would be identifiable info.&nbsp; My one concern would be that with the OP setting it up could he also use it to scam us - I dare say any regular online poker players have been in this position before - you get pocket aces and go all in, you get called by a player with a similar chip stack, turns out they are holding 3 7 off, and hey presto they hit their straight on river - obviously you were called because the opponent knew what was coming out.

They can be cursed, I tell ya...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;Hah fuck you guys I gotta straight!&quot;<br /><br />*opponent lays down flush that he got on the river *<br /><br />&quot;FUCK&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Oh tell me about it. I had a flop trips, on the turn had a full house, and i was able to get a guy up to 2 thousand. on the river he beat me with a 4 of a kind. so annoying. He was also holding an off-suit non-connecting pre-flop hand. But this was a live game in a reputable casino, so I couldn&#039;t say he was cheating. Just extremely lucky.<br /><br /><br />But anyway, yea i do understand your concern too when it comes to online gambling. I also would say the same thing, that I wouldn&#039;t cheat. However, I wouldn&#039;t mind submitting to an unpaid, unbiased 3rd party that would agree to testify to my code.<br /><br />Another option is to have the usernames on the gambling site be the same as the usernames here on SR, and this way you&#039;d sort of be able to call them out if you think they&#039;re cheating. Or maybe have a separate forum for the gambling site or something.<br /><br />Honestly though, like most people will tell you, the casino doesn&#039;t really have any reason to cheat. I would lay it out in the open that the house will take a small percentage of every pot or something like that (that&#039;s how most of the poker spots near me operate). Either that, or everyone needs to give some kind of ante every x number of hands. There are players that play with the house&#039;s money and win for the house, but they don&#039;t cheat, just try to legitimately win some money.<br /><br />But those are the only options I can think of to ensure you against any foul play.
