				Yeah, I&#039;m very active in about 4-5 other drug forums, and so far this one seems to be very different.<br />Even in my previous years of selling counterfeit accounts, this forum is fucking rough :P<br /><br />I&#039;m generally liked everywhere else I go but here, I figured out opinion isn&#039;t really appreciated here.<br />But after going like -3 I said fuck it, and started posting whatever I felt like :) It feels better to just be yourself no matter what the community thinks.

				hahaha, thanks everybody.&nbsp; and i didn&#039;t imply you were pedophiles.&nbsp; when i was 20, i would have fucked a 16 year old too.&nbsp; it&#039;s just wasn&#039;t a topic i expected to stumble across here.&nbsp; <br /><br />but, now i&#039;m getting old, and i have friends with teenage daughters.&nbsp; <br /><br />but yeah, i will always speak my mind.&nbsp; i&#039;ve found in life, that if i offend you, i probably don&#039;t want to be around you anyway.&nbsp;

				BTW I hope you like the karma, for some reason I&#039;d estimate I&#039;ve spent about 5 minutes total staring at it whilst on here. <br />I&#039;m not sure why, I think it&#039;s because your picture is the same as that other ozzie, who recently changed his after you had selected the same as him :P
