				I don&#039;t know much about the British royals but here in Holland we have a Queen and all that as well.<br />Imo it gives stature to a country to have a King/Queen, impresses foreign countries and shit.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mind having them around, even if they cost a lot of public money.

				In the UK, it costs only 1 dollar per person per year to support the royal family. I don&#039;t mind sacrificing 1 dollar a year to maintain such an institution.&nbsp; I don&#039;t really care for the present royal family, but I don&#039;t reject an institution simply because its present occupants are unequal to it, if the institution itself is of any value. <br /><br />I favour royalty in general, as a principle and an historically valuable institution, even though I have some reservations about the House of Windsor in particular.<br /><br />The British royalty has been a joke since the death of Charles I.

				yeah, I didn&#039;t think it cost the public much money.&nbsp; They are independently wealthy and have their own streams on income.&nbsp; The titles may give privileges, but since they are no longer a governing monarch they no longer have access to the public funds.&nbsp; I am an American and could be wrong because I keep up with them as much as I would any celebrity.&nbsp; But don&#039;t be fooled. The American public seems to be enamored with almost anything that deals with Royalty or celebrities.&nbsp; <br /><br />To the rest the folks that share American continent.&nbsp; When I refer to US citizens as Americans I haven&#039;t forgot that you are Americans as well it is just easier to write it this way.&nbsp;

You realise I was joking, maybe removing your head from up your ass you may have clocked that. If you can&#039;t take a bit of banter and then feel the need to bring out the race card (badly misused as it was, bad form there my friend) then really, you are a bit pathetic. And the comment about Heroin isn&#039;t exactly a lie is it? The addict rates north of the border aren&#039;t exactly record breaking are they (unless you are counting how many you can get to). Jesus Christ if you made a joke about England I wouldn&#039;t jump down your throat, I&#039;d probably think it was funny. You need to get a sense of humour son and not take life so seriously. Although with Alex Salmond telling you what to think I&#039;m not really too surprised to be honest. ;)<br /><br />Oh and if we are talking about Braveheart you should watch these in order GG, you&#039;ll realize that Wallace was a gay pedophile - <br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybQCNb4AuW4<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuLSoyn-OBM&amp;feature=relmfu

You really should check your figures. And the U.K doesn&#039;t even need the North Sea wells anyway because of the black gold mine that lies just off the coast of the Falklands anyway which as yet remains untouched and we don&#039;t even have to share. Relying on the deposits in the North Sea reserves isn&#039;t exactly planning for the nations future. It&#039;s just resting on your laurels. And lol, who gives a fuck about the house prices in Aberdeen? Fuck-a-doodle-doo, it takes more than property market in 1 city. London is the financial center of EUROPE. Edinburgh has what that London doesn&#039;t have? Apart from more haggis and junkies per capita? <br /><br />If Scotland was so well off Alex Salmond wouldn&#039;t be trying to ensure that his dirty, sweaty, greasy, grubby-lying-shister hand is still in the U.K tax pot after you finally detach yourselves from us. Unless he is a thief as well as a fantasist/liar about Scotlands capability to be on it&#039;s own. You&#039;ll have an economic meltdown within the first decade and either be begging to come back into the fold or if not that you will definitely have the IMF&#039;s phone number saved in your national phonebook. Either way, it&#039;s not a promising forecast to say the least.

				On the whole Scottish economy point..

The problem is if that the Scots are moronic enough to think they can make it on their own they are going to end up asking us for bail outs which we don&#039;t need at the moment. If we do end up giving them the funds as well as the IMF (which Salmond would obviously go to too because he&#039;s a greedy shister) then not only are they going to fuck themselves but they will try and drag us into their abyss too.

				Psilocybin, that would be a nice picture if the royals went stateside to watch a game!<br />For a long time the royals were held in a bad light.&nbsp; Think of all the shit the Queen had to go through after Diana died.&nbsp; It was commented that she never made any appearances after the incident, but people forget she had to look after Dianas kids.<br />The show of crowds over the last few days just goes to show how popular they have become again.&nbsp; Probably more so than ever.<br />

				mito, its hardly tyranny mate.<br />The royals get something like 75pence per person per year so they are hardly scroungers.<br />They dont even get involved in any kind of governmental projects.<br />What they do however is tons of charity work.&nbsp; Just look at what princess Di did back in her day.&nbsp; That is just a glimpse of how much they help people out in poorer parts of the world.<br />If you want tyranny, look at the reign of Geroge W Bush or geroge junior.&nbsp; Those men had power like nothing i have ever known in my lifetime.

				Yeah I mean if you balance 75p per person and then compare it to the amount of jobs they create and the amount of funds they do raise for charity through organisations like the Prince&#039;s Trust and other things like that it easily balances out.

Not sure if its ever happened in my lifetime tho. The crown actually&nbsp; gives government its powers, why else would parliamentarians, police, army swear and many others an oath of allegiance to the queen?<br /><br />Here is what police must swear:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I Frodo Baggins of The Shire do solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that I will well and truly serve the Queen in the office of constable, with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality, upholding fundamental human rights and according equal respect to all people; and that I will, to the best of my power, cause the peace to be kept and preserved and prevent all offences against people and property; and that while I continue to hold the said office I will, to the best of my skill and knowledge, discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to law</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />For me the royals are essentially benefit scrounging, parasitic gangsters who stole the country from your ancestors by means of murder, torture and other such pleasantries. They are relatively benign compared to their predecessors but I don&#039;t see how that validates their position, if I&#039;ve been sat on your couch for 4 days playing on your xbox knowing i&#039;ve outstayed my welcome it doesn&#039;t give me any valid claim to your property, even if i sit there for 200 years. People have forgotten history.<br /><br />The claim that the monarch costs each person 75p is propaganda released from the palace, they arrive at this figure by dividing a laughably modest sum by every person in the country including children (not every tax payer - way to massage figures). In any case, they have more than enough personal wealth to be financially self sufficient for many generations, yet they continue to dip into the public purse to maintain their highly extravagant lifestyles. <br /><br />Are they really so good for trade? Prince Andrew is &#039;trade ambassador&#039; but what has he actually done that is of any magnitude to the UK economy? I don&#039;t buy the stuff about Saudi kings and such wanting to deal with our &#039;royalty&#039;, they are businessmen, in it for money, they want to deal with real competent British businessmen with earned credibility, not some dude with a handout title... in any case Andrew&#039;s just one man if he lost his royal status hes still got his hookups. The city brings many billions of quids worth of business into the UK each month, removing the royals would be like taking a grain of sand away from a beach.<br /><br />So the charity work some of them do is positive, but they do not need to be royals to do it. Pretty sure they&#039;re all high profile enough to continue pimping the charity side of things, they certainly have enough money. The cynic in me tends top believe that the charity work is i nice little bone to throw the peasants in order to try and justify their pointless leeching of our money.<br /><br />A lot of people claim they are good for tourism too but people come to see the architecture and to see London, pretty sure most people realise that they are not going to see the Queen.<br /><br />And all the fucking bears that have to die for those stupid hats!!!!!! :-(<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I am sorry but look at Norway, Sweden and Finland. They have no need to deal with Saudi on the scale that the US or UK do.<br /><br />Saudi does not even have an embassy in Norway, the closest is in Stockholm. There are over 2000 Muslims living in Norway yet less than 100 Norwegians living in Saudi according to the last figures published. Pretty strange the Norwegians have an embassy in Saudi for 100 residents, yet saudi is not allowed an embassy in Norway for it&#039;s 2000+ residents.<br /><br />The fact Norway denied Saudi&#039;s application to build a giant mosque, unless Saudi reviewed it being a criminal offense to start a christian community over there, is just a bigger fuck you to the Arabs.<br />&nbsp;What do we learn form the Norwegians? They are not afraid to stick it to Saudi!<br /><br />

I am just take a pragmatic view on how the world works and the U.S and U.K (or others) wont change because it doesn&#039;t serve their best interest to do so and that wont change for quite a while. It&#039;s just how it is.&nbsp; :-\
