				Go to bitinstant.com select the money gram option&gt;bitcoin address, fill out the info.<br />From there you have till 9pm before moneygram closes at your local&nbsp; location if you want them tonight.<br />That&#039;s it then you have coins in your account with the info you provided to bitinstant.

				With bitinstant-moneygram-btc address I can place an order within 2 hours. The only thing I don&#039;t like is the 3.99% fee and i don&#039;t know how many BTC will be in my wallet till they get there. Any 1 have advice for getting more BTC for $?

				The option I told you is going to be the easiest and best way. You can try #bitcoin-otc and see if someone will trade with you through paypal but that&#039;s kinda a pain in the ass, plus you could get scammed a lot easier.

				I scoured for hours looking for ways to do this. bitlocal.com if you are lucky there is a dealer in your area. otherwise bitinstant is coming to be quickest/most reliable way. don&#039;t fall for people offering over paypal, lotsa scammers.

				I go to the SR money section and either use BTCKing or BTCMaster, BTCMaster is quite a bit cheaper he only charges a dollar per coin and it&#039;s very anonymous, all your doing is putting cash into somebody elses account, they dont need your name or anything. Every time I&#039;ve gone through either of them my coins are in my SR account within an hour or hour and a half at the most.

				I was having trouble figuring out how to buy bits too. Here is what I did. I went to Walmart and bought a Moneypak (Fee $5.00). I then went to the money section of Silk Road and clicked on Sugar Mama&#039;s vendor page and followed the instructions. Withing 12 hours I had my bits. I have no idea what I&#039;m doing either but it was easy. Sugar Mama has her fees on her page so it&#039;s transparent.
