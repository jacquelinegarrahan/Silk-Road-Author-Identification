				Anyone can become addicted!<br />To much people are addicted without knowing it and thinking every is ok.<br /><br />For everything there is a first time..<br />Many people trying something new and don´t know what can happen!<br /><br />I love drugs, but i had my problems with it and it took me years to learn to take them safe or useful!<br /><br />Are (or were) you addicted ?<br />What are your experience? <br />Did something happened to you?<br /><br />Write your experience to help unemployed people!<br /><br /><br /><br />I started with 13&nbsp; to sneak me in to night clubs and bars and drunk alcohol on weekend.<br />Some best time of my life. many friends, first girlfriend,Sex, partys<br />Everything was perfect and nothing to do without school.<br />Funny time, but boring after some time!<br />4 month before my 16th birthday a friend asked me to smoke a joint,but i won´t!<br />He nerved me some days after i sad yes. I sad i only want to try it..<br />I felt nothing(bad weed) so i decided to try another time.<br />At my second time i was so stoned and felt great.<br />So i started one time a month, one time a week and in the end every day.<br />In this time i also started to smoke cigarets!<br />I only chilled at home and i shit on all of my old friends and than my new friends smoked.<br />After a year i eat mushrooms with friends than i thought it´s only nature.<br />Fluuussshhh you will know, the first psychedelic drug is a extreme experience!<br />But i thought every chemical drug is stronger than nature drugs.<br />After some time someone snorted speed an made me also a line.<br />I was frustrated of the effect and i decided to try other chemical drugs.<br />In this time i was a school boy with low money, so i also sold drugs to friends.<br />Mostly i took psychedelic drugs like lsd and mdma. <br />After 3 years i felt depressive after smoking weed&nbsp; <br />and i stopped with drugs.<br />I found a nice girlfriend and new friends, but i started to drinking a lot of alcohol.<br />On one evening i was at city and i met one of my old supplier and he gave me 4mg Subutex.<br />I snorted it with my girlfriend and i felt so much love in me and i was happy like never before.<br />More happy than on my first shrooms. <br />Some time later i took benzos and Subutex (nothing other was available at this time).<br />Till one day i drove after 10 Rivoltriel with my motorbike.<br />After i awake everything hurts and my bike was nearly destroyed.<br />So same shit again! stopped the drugs and same time later starting again!<br />On this days i lived in south Austria in the near of Slovenia and i found a supplier from there, which sold <br />uncut H (like or better than Sr) and i started to deal a little bit.<br />I payed between 20 and 50€ for one gram and 30km over the state border i soled it for 80€ the cut stuff.<br />I got a new girlfriend and started to use H with her.<br />It was so cheap that i never had problems with my dependence for nearly one year.<br />With H it is so beautiful and easy to live that i ever had the feeling that i don´t use drugs anymore.<br />The most time i only used H and did my work and nothing more ..<br />After 2 years my supplier got busted and from one day on i had nothing.<br />I went to hospital and made a open drug rehab for 2 years.<br /><br />From about 20 friends i´ve smoked at first about 17 use or used chemical drugs and about the half<br />use or used H daily!<br />Maybe it was our city, without H everything was expensive and from low quality for us!<br />I do not regret anything I&#039;ve done. A bad experience is also a good experience!<br />I can recommend to anyone to search for help if you are addict, my rehab was good <br />for me. Some days before, i took some drugs against my pain and<br />on my first day in rehab i had to make a urine tests! I was positive on 7 substances!!<br />Really eye opener...<br />After this i was positive on 3 tests from about 30 in 2 years!<br /><br />Many people are careless with there live (i was the same)<br />I ánd friends took stuff and snorted 0,2-03 or ate 2 pills without knowing something about the substance.<br />What could happen if you do this with 80%speed or speaker pills.<br /><br />Now i only buy sometimes drugs on Sr and don´t use them every day.<br />Silk Road is perfect, it is difficult to get addict if you only order sometimes.<br />But who knows... ;)<br /><br />Sry if i have a bad english :P

				Cigarettes were my addiction. I started smoking when I learned what DARE had taught me about marijuana was false and assumed that cigarettes weren&#039;t actually bad or addictive either. I smoked a whole pack one day, got addicted by the next day, and turned out to be terribly mistaken.

				I remember listening to dare in school, they said &quot;If you take LSD you will hallucinate and see things that aren&#039;t there.&nbsp; I was like &quot;where can I find that shit!&quot;<br /><br />But not to get off the topic, I got hooked to H in my late teens and didn&#039;t know what the fuck I was getting in to.&nbsp; Wish I had someone take me by the neck and say &quot;listen kid, this shit is going to fuck with you for the next few years and put you through hell&quot;<br /><br />Information is key when doing any drug.&nbsp; Be informed, know your facts and know your playing with fire when doing some drugs.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m lucky in that I don&#039;t have a strong compulsion for any drug that I might become addicted to. I enjoy heroin and meth on occasion, probably once a week, maybe every other week. I smoke roughly a pack of cigarettes a week, but when I&#039;m tight on cash I may not buy them for weeks. Perhaps I&#039;ll be lost when I try crack.

				Not anyone can become addicted. Especially to Heroin. I found it easy to become physically addicted but no harder to quit. Also I found it to be a pretty boring drug. There is euphoria but no depth to it.<br /><br />I guess this is why most H users only use on rare occasions and only something like 2% actually get addicted.

				I&#039;ve been taking opiates for almost 4 years. I&#039;m now Iving Heroin. I don&#039;t do it everyday. But almost haha.<br /><br />It&#039;s all on your perspective. And you can change your perceptive without any drug(Which Is why I do art).<br /><br />I can constantly change my perspective of the perspectives I&#039;m having, so it&#039;s pretty much all a mind game.<br /><br />So I think there is some depth to that and opiates are involved.<br /><br />But also LSD jaja
