				Non-aligned...<br /><br />Bit hard to define, I guess some sort of &quot;Social libertarian&quot;.<br /><br />I subscribe to most libertarian ideas, but I also believe that a society&#039;s vital services aren&#039;t served well by privatization and profit motives. Government should, for the better part, stay out of people&#039;s lives. However, I don&#039;t believe that Adam Smith&#039;s &quot;invisible hand&quot; would lead to happiness and unicorns either.<br /><br />The most vocal libertarians, like the hardcore ones, Rothbart etc., can be found in the US. But imho many make the mistake or fall victim to the fallacy that because the US government is particularly bad ALL government is ALWAYS bad.

I am socially very liberal, but very &quot;conservative&quot; on some issues. Pro legalizing all drugs, pro gay marriage/rights, pro-choice, pro gun/anti gun control, but I do not believe that our social safety nets are worth the return on investment, definitely need to downsize the government, and eliminate many .gov agencies, including massive cuts to the military, top to bottom reform of Medi-anything, as well as social security. Something really needs to be done about health care in this country, but that piece of shit Obama passed is NOT it. Whatever it is it needds to address the real problem, which is the cost of health care, not insurance, and Obama&#039;s masterpiece, approved by the insurance companies, doesn&#039;t do anything to effect those changes. I&#039;ll stop my rant now, could go on for days :P

But government is a necessary evil. People always hate governments, always........until their house is on fire, or they lie on the ground bleeding or the chemical plant down the road poisons their kids. Kinda like with religion, everyone prays in a foxhole, even atheists.

				My political philosophy can be summed up with the Golden Rule: &quot;Do unto others as you would have done unto you.&quot; That means thinking about what others want and respecting their wishes, as you would want your wishes respected. I can&#039;t think of anyone who really, deep down, wants to be told what to do under the threat of fines, prison and death. Nobody likes having their choices cancelled by those stronger than them. They only like having OTHER people&#039;s choices, which they do not like, canceled. But the Golden Rule would say, if you want to be free to do as you wish, you must give others that same freedom - even if you don&#039;t like what they will do with it.<br /><br />So basically, I&#039;m against coercion in general. Give the person doing the coercing a badge, a costume, a crown, or an elected office and it makes not a damn bit of difference. Give the coercion special names like &quot;eminent domain&quot;, &quot;welfare&quot;, &quot;public morality&quot;, or &quot;national defense&quot; and it still makes no difference.

				My dictionary states that an anarchist is &quot;a person who believes that government and laws are undesirable and should be abolished&quot;.<br />For those that consider themselves to be anarchists of one form or another, would you say this is an accurate (if simplified) description?<br />You might say that I can&#039;t see past the status quo, but I can&#039;t see how a lack of laws and government would be considered progress, quiet the opposite.<br />I&#039;m all for freedom of the individual and less government intrusion into our lives, but anarchy seems impracticable and idealistic.
