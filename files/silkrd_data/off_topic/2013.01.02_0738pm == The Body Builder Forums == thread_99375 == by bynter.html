				As a community of people who research and are interested in drugs, I think we&#039;ve all been interested in Ephedrine at one point, and in research about, I imagine a lot of us have found ourselves on a thread at the Body-Builder forums. And as a community filled with people with an average IQ above 80, I think we can all appreciate it. So I dedicate this thread to the ricidulousness of the Body-Builder Forums, Bro.

Searching for jailbait in the forum here: http://forum.bodybuilding.com gives 84 threads (many of which have several dozen posts or more), with titles such as &quot;We need a jailbait thread!!!!!&quot; and &quot;im trying to come up with ways to get jailbait &quot; and &quot;I never had a girlfiend untill I was 18, I missed out on all the jailbait&quot; for some examples. Searching for jailbait here turns up a total of 18 posts containing the keyword jailbait , although that is not the number of threads with a title containing the word. A quick scan through the threads here shows that most of the people saying it are saying it for entirely different reasons than the people on the body building fourms. <br /><br />Then again that forum is way bigger than ours so it makes sense that the number of such threads would scale upwards as well. I just have some association between body building forums and people talking about jailbait, much like the person I quoted associates them with people having avatars of themselves without shirts on, calling each other bro and having absolutely no idea what they are talking about :).

EC alone gives you all that you need.

It&#039;s responsibility is to counter the heightened blood pressure levels that the EC stack causes. I checked my blood pressure every couple of days though and it was never really a concern. It may also help prolong ephedrine effects. It&#039;s acceptable if you use 81mg (one) aspirin each day. Honestly, I&#039;d rather just increase my fish oil intake to balance out the BP a bit.<br /><br />&quot;2) The &quot;effective dosage&quot; at which aspirin was added to the EC stack was at 325 mg. 325 mg of aspirin 3 times a day puts you at risk for developing ulcers and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Again, if you would like to use it to decrease risks/chances of high blood pressure, stick to the 81mg aspirin.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;•Doses of 1,000 mg per day of aspirin caused gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding that, in some cases, were clinically significant. In the largest postinfarction study (the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS) with 4,500 people), the percentage of incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms for the aspirin (1,000 mg of a standard, solid-tablet formulation) and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, were stomach pain (14.5%, 4.4%), heartburn (11.9%, 4.8%), nausea and/or vomiting (7.6%, 2.1%), hospitalization for GI disorder (4.9%, 3.5%). In the A.I. and other trials, aspirin-treated patients had increased rates of gross gastrointestinal bleeding. Symptoms and signs of gastrointestinal irritation were not significantly increased in subjects treated for unstable angina with buffered aspirin in solution.&quot;<br />
